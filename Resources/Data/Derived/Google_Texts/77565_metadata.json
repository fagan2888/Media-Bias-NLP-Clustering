My hips are sore, my knees are sore, my shoulders are sore, my back is sore. I get up every day and it takes me awhile to get going. I hurt every day.\u201d\n\nBut Rogers, who lives on a skinny, south-pointing finger of land in Casco Bay called Orr\u2019s Island, doesn\u2019t go to the doctor much. \u201cI never really complained about too much unless I was really hurting,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d schedule a doctor\u2019s appointment with all the intentions of going,\u201d Rogers says. \u201cBut if there was an opportunity to haul traps for a few days, I\u2019d set aside the doctor\u2019s appointment and go haul traps.\u201d This summer he\u2019s running 800 traps, which means his days starts around 5:30 a.m.\n\nRogers appears to be pretty typical of Maine\u2019s 5,000 lobstermen, and of all 9,000 people who work in the state\u2019s fishing industry.\n\n\u201cThey work really hard and have a lot of chronic diseases,\u201d says Miranda Jo Rogers, Jon\u2019s daughter. \u201cThese people have a stoic mentality \u2014 they don\u2019t seek health [care] until they really need it. So there are no really positive role models on how to be proactive and keep healthy.\u201d\n\nMiranda Rogers aims to do something about that. Although she\u2019s still a Tufts Medical School student, she\u2019s taken on a project she expects will take her to graduation and beyond \u2014 maybe decades beyond.\n\n\u201cI am happily indebted to the community that raised me, and I wish to make a long-lasting difference in Maine,\u201d she wrote recently to the state\u2019s lobster harvesters, asking them to fill out a 24-page questionnaire on their health.\n\nIt will be the most complete look ever at the health of a difficult-to-reach population with special health care needs, low rates of health insurance and high skepticism of outsiders.\n\n\u201cUp and down the coast, the commercial fisherman is very talkative on his own turf, but it\u2019s a very secretive bunch and not that trusting,\u201d Jon Rogers says.\n\nFor that reason, many of them are suspicious-to-hostile toward the Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare, even though half the Down East population of fishermen lack health insurance and 25 percent of those in southern Maine, far higher than the general population.\n\n\u201cI get emails saying, \u2018Why are you asking these questions? Are you an agent of Obama or something?\u2019\u201d Miranda Rogers says. \u201cI say, \u2018Nope, I\u2019m not. Don\u2019t worry.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cMiranda understands you can\u2019t necessarily use a traditional approach,\u201d says Patrice McCarron, executive director of the Maine Lobstermen\u2019s Association, which is supporting her project. \u201cShe\u2019s from a lobster-fishing family. She definitely has two feet solidly on the ground and a unique understanding of the needs of this community.\u201d\n\nUltimately, Rogers hopes she\u2019ll be able to raise enough funding to launch a medical van that can travel from port to port, providing convenient care to fishermen and lobstermen.\n\nBut first, she has to document the need. She has some idea what she\u2019s likely to find.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of melanoma from constant sun exposure. Hearing loss from standing near loud boat engines. A lot of bait poisoning \u2014 infections from rotten bait.\u201d \u2013 Miranda Rogers\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of melanoma from constant sun exposure,\u201d Rogers says. \u201cHearing loss from standing near loud boat engines. A lot of bait poisoning \u2014 infections from rotten bait. Lacerations and other injuries in a dangerous environment.\u201d\n\nShe also expects to document vision loss from solar glare. Cancers that could have been caught early but weren\u2019t. A fair amount of diabetes due to poor diets and lack of exercise.\n\n\u201cEven though they work hard, they actually don\u2019t get much exercise,\u201d Rogers says. \u201cThe captain of the boat stands in front and doesn\u2019t get much outside a five-foot radius.\u201d\n\nJ.J. Barlett of Fishing Partnership Support Services, a Massachusetts-based nonprofit that promotes the health of commercial fishing families, verifies the special needs of these workers.\n\n\u201cBack pain is 52 percent higher in fishermen than in the general population, and they have 36 percent more neck pain,\u201d Barlett says. \u201cYou also see problems related to the stress of the work \u2013 things like hypertension, depression and headache, which are all 20 to 65 percent higher than average.\u201d\n\nFishing families are five times more likely to lack health insurance, Bartlett says.\n\nAnd fishing is the nation\u2019s second-deadliest occupation, after logging, according to the U.S. Department of Labor.\n\nThe Fishing Partnership\u2019s numbers come from a health insurance plan it sponsored between 1997 and 2011.\n\nBartlett says a more thorough-going assessment of fishermen\u2019s health care needs is sorely needed. His group is also supporting Rogers\u2019 project. \u201cWhen we saw Miranda was spearheading this project, it was just a natural fit,\u201d Bartlett says.\n\nAs for fishermen\u2019s antipathy toward Obamacare, Jon Rogers thinks it will gradually fade. \u201cSome people figure the Affordable Care Act was shoved down their throat,\u201d he says. \u201cThey wouldn\u2019t like it if it were the best thing in the world for them. That\u2019s just stubbornness on some people\u2019s part.\u201d\n\nRogers\u2019 own brother, also a lobsterman, discovered he could cut his family\u2019s health insurance premiums by a third because of the ACA. \u201cSo for him,\u201d Jon Rogers says, \u201che\u2019s sold on it.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Tufts medical student whose father is a Maine lobsterman launches the first survey of the health toll that lobstering takes on its harvesters.", "og": {"site_name": "commonhealth", "description": "A Tufts medical student whose father is a Maine lobsterman launches the first survey of the health toll that lobstering takes on its harvesters.", "title": "Hidden Price Of That Succulent Lobster: Health Woes Of Stoic Lobstermen", "url": "http://commonhealth.wbur.org/2014/08/lobsterman-health-woes", "image": "http://s3.amazonaws.com/media.wbur.org/wordpress/15/files/2014/08/biglobster-620x415.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://commonhealth.wbur.org/2014/08/lobsterman-health-woes", "image": "//s3.amazonaws.com/media.wbur.org/wordpress/15/files/2014/08/biglobster-620x415.jpg", "site": "@commonhealth", "card": "summary", "title": "Hidden Price Of That Succulent Lobster: Health Woes Of Stoic Lobstermen"}, "DC.date.issued": "2014-08-29", "date": "Fri, 29 Aug 2014 10:28:55 -0400", "fb": {"admins": 1549080028, "app_id": 134067973330252}, "msvalidate.01": "D02D46BAEDB3F81FC1B1DE2A8CB69551"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde26f\"", "article_summary": "It will be the most complete look ever at the health of a difficult-to-reach population with special health care needs, low rates of health insurance and high skepticism of outsiders.\n\u201cThese people have a stoic mentality \u2014 they don\u2019t seek health [care] until they really need it.\nBartlett says a more thorough-going assessment of fishermen\u2019s health care needs is sorely needed.\nHidden Price Of That Succulent Lobster: Health Woes Of Stoic LobstermenBy Richard KnoxMainer Jon Rogers started lobstering 47 years ago at the age of 10, when he\u2019d go out on his grandfather\u2019s boat.\nThat\u2019s just stubbornness on some people\u2019s part.\u201dRogers\u2019 own brother, also a lobsterman, discovered he could cut his family\u2019s health insurance premiums by a third because of the ACA."}
