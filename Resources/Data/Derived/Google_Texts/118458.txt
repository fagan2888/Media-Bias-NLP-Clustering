NEW YORK (MainStreet) — Unrest in Ukraine, Iraq and Israel may be causing jitters, but making changes to investments based on politics may cause more harm than good in the long run.

“If you feel insecure or uncertain and that you need to take advantage of certain stocks or avoid others, it’s a sign that you’re making a financial decision based on emotion,” said Hutch Ashoo with Pillar Wealth Management in Walnut Creek, California.

Although President Obama talked of ending war in Afghanistan and Iraq during his campaign, last week he outlined a plan for air strikes against the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria in Syria and Iraq. Still, that’s no excuse to make sudden moves or trades.

“We don’t advise our clients to change their asset allocation because of or in anticipation of a particular event,” said Fatima Iqbal, a certified financial planner and senior investment strategist with Azzad Asset Management. “That’s not how we manage money. Market timing is extremely difficult even for experienced investors.”

The average recommended asset allocation is 60% invested in equities and 40% in bonds but because of ongoing global unrest, Josh Scheinker advises a slightly different set up.

“Risk tolerance and income should dictate your asset allocation,” said Scheinker, partner with Janney Montgomery Scott in Baltimore, Maryland. “In this current environment, a 70-30 allocation is most likely more suitable while keeping a close eye on the fixed income side.”
