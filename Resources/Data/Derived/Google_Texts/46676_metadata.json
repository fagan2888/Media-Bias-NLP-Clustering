It is African-Americans, she added to more applause, who \u201chave made the most advances and gains\u201d thanks to the health law.\n\nMrs. Clinton\u2019s assault was an indication of how aggressively she intends to run against Mr. Sanders, who routed her by 22 percentage points in the New Hampshire primary this week. Separately, the \u201csuper PAC\u201d supporting her, Priorities USA, said it would begin running ads that Mrs. Clinton is the true heir to Mr. Obama\u2019s legacy when it comes to helping blacks.\n\nThe electorate in the South Carolina Democratic primary on Feb. 27 is expected to be at least half black, a constituency that reveres Mr. Obama and was crucial in his defeat of Mrs. Clinton in the 2008 Democratic contest here.\n\nMrs. Clinton still enjoys a substantial advantage over Mr. Sanders among African-Americans in polls, but her campaign is plainly concerned about his making inroads with such voters. Her campaign has conducted focus groups of African-American voters, an aide said, which revealed that many of them associate attacks on the health law as no different from attacks on Mr. Obama himself.\n\nMr. Sanders voted for the legislation, but has called for going further and enacting universal, government-run health care for all Americans.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.vdare.com/posts/did-south-carolina-blacks-interpret-bernies-single-payer-health-plan-as-a-racist-diss-on-obamacare?page=no-campaign", "image": "https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/vdare-live/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/28075215/sanders_at_benedict-768x469.jpg"}, "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "Mr. Sanders voted for the legislation, but has called for going further and enacting universal, government-run health care for all Americans.\nSeparately, the \u201csuper PAC\u201d supporting her, Priorities USA, said it would begin running ads that Mrs. Clinton is the true heir to Mr. Obama\u2019s legacy when it comes to helping blacks.\nMrs. Clinton still enjoys a substantial advantage over Mr. Sanders among African-Americans in polls, but her campaign is plainly concerned about his making inroads with such voters.\nIt is African-Americans, she added to more applause, who \u201chave made the most advances and gains\u201d thanks to the health law.\nMrs. Clinton\u2019s assault was an indication of how aggressively she intends to run against Mr. Sanders, who routed her by 22 percentage points in the New Hampshire primary this week."}
