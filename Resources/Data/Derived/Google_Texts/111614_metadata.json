The meetings were scripted, pre-arranged affairs filled with people transported to the events by Hillary staffers.\n\nWorse, one of these \u201cordinary\u201d people was a young man who was an Obama operative and Vice President Biden worker and is currently training as an Obamacare lobbyist. Two others were a worker at abortion mill operator Planned Parenthood and the president of the University of Iowa\u2019s College Democrats. All three are already vested in the political system and a bit outside the arena of \u201cordinary\u201d Americans.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nIn the end, Hillary\u2019s \u201castroturf\u201d stops in Iowa were carefully orchestrated and far from spontaneous meetings with potential voters.\n\nSome reports are now leaking out identifying the three Democrat operatives who met with Hillary at an Iowa coffee shop.\n\nOne was a young man named Austin Bird. The Iowan has already spent several years working for the Democrat party machine in Iowa. For instance, in 2012, Bird served as a volunteer for Team Obama, serving out an internship in Obama\u2019s Iowa campaign office.\n\nBird also acted as Biden\u2019s chauffeur when Obama\u2019s number two visited Iowa in 2014. Additionally, Bird is now training to be an Obamacare lobbyist.\n\nThe other two \u201cregular Americans\u201d who sat at Hillary\u2019s coffee shop table were also deeply involved in party politics.\n\nThey have been identified as Carter Bell, the president of the University of Iowa\u2019s College Democrats, and Planned Parenthood employee Sara Sedlacek.\n\nIt has been discovered that the visit was pre-arranged and planned by Clinton campaign staffer Troy Price, the recently resigned executive director of the Iowa Democratic Party.\n\nMr. Bird says that he was not aware that his visit would be with Hillary Clinton herself, but he confirmed that it was all arranged by Price.\n\nThe orchestrated coffee shop event is part and parcel of the pre-arranged events that included a \u201ctip\u201d to a New York Times reporter that Clinton would be lunching at a Chipotle store so that the reporter could take a \u201ccandid\u201d photo as the former secretary of state stood in line waiting for her meal. The tip most likely came from the Clinton campaign itself.\n\nSome of Team Hillary\u2019s orchestration, though, has already backfired, as it was learned that many of the candidate\u2019s Facebook and Twitter followers were either fake accounts or purchased by the campaign to make it seem like she had more \u201cordinary Americans\u201d as followers.\n\nFollow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston or email the author at igcolonel@hotmail.com.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Hillary Clinton's Iowa campaign stops with \"ordinary Americans\" were actually scripted affairs with people transported by her staffers.", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Hillary Clinton's Iowa campaign stops with \"ordinary Americans\" were actually scripted affairs with people transported by her staffers.", "title": "Hillary Clinton Staffers Drove 'Ordinary Americans' to Photo Op - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/04/Hillary-Clinton-Iowa-cafe-reuters.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/04/16/hillary-clinton-staffers-drove-ordinary-americans-to-photo-op/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Hillary Clinton's Iowa campaign stops with \"ordinary Americans\" were actually scripted affairs with people transported by her staffers.", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/04/Hillary-Clinton-Iowa-cafe-reuters.jpg", "title": "Hillary Clinton Staffers Drove 'Ordinary Americans' to Photo Op - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "app_id": 1243316582352556, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "2016 presidential campaign, election, Hillary Clinton, Iowa, President,2016 Presidential Race, Big Government, Hillary Clinton,Hillary", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "2016 Presidential Race", "tag": "President", "published_time": "2015-04-16T07:45:22-07:00", "categories": "Big Government,2016 Presidential Race,Hillary Clinton"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2b27\"", "article_summary": "The tip most likely came from the Clinton campaign itself.\nMr. Bird says that he was not aware that his visit would be with Hillary Clinton herself, but he confirmed that it was all arranged by Price.\nFor instance, in 2012, Bird served as a volunteer for Team Obama, serving out an internship in Obama\u2019s Iowa campaign office.\nThe meetings were scripted, pre-arranged affairs filled with people transported to the events by Hillary staffers.\nAll three are already vested in the political system and a bit outside the arena of \u201cordinary\u201d Americans."}
