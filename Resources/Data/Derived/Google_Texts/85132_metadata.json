And we don\u2019t mean Bill and Chelsea.\n\nNo, she should come right out and ask for the resignations of Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel and Democratic National Committee Chair \u2014 and Florida congresswoman \u2014 Debbie Wasserman Schultz. In one masterstroke, she could separate herself from two of the most prominent of all corporate Democratic elitists.\n\nEach is a Clinton disciple and devotee, each has profited mightily from the association and each represents all that is wrong with a Democratic Party that in the pursuit of money from rich donors and powerful corporations has abandoned those it once so proudly represented \u2014 working men and women.\n\nRahm Emanuel first came to prominence as head of the finance committee for Bill Clinton\u2019s 1992 presidential campaign, browbeating ever-increasing amounts of money out of fat cat donors, and following Clinton into the White House as a senior adviser attuned to the wishes and profits of organized wealth. Few pushed harder for NAFTA, a treaty that would cost a million or more working people their livelihood, or for the \u201cthree-strikes-and-you\u2019re-out\u201d crime bill which Clinton later admitted was a mistake. After alienating most of Washington with his arrogance and bluster Emanuel left in 1998 and went into investment banking in Chicago, making more than $16 million in less than three years.\n\nHe came back to Washington as a three-term Illinois congressman, chaired the fundraising Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (calling on his Wall Street sources to get in on the gravy by electing so-called New Democrats over New Deal Democrats), and soon was back in the White House as Barack Obama\u2019s chief of staff. There, he infamously told a strategy meeting of liberal groups and administration types that the liberals were \u201cretarded\u201d for planning to run attack ads against conservative Democrats resisting Obamacare. Classy.Writer Jane Hamsher described him as tough guy wannabe but really \u201ca brown nose for power ready to rumble on behalf of the status quo.\u201d\n\nAnd now he\u2019s mayor of Chicago, reelected last April for a second term, but, as historian Rick Pearlstein wrote in The New Yorker a couple of months ago, \u201cChicagoans \u2014 and Democrats nationally \u2014 are suffering buyer\u2019s remorse.\u201d\n\nRemember that shocking dashcam video of a black 17-year-old named Laquan McDonald being shot 16 times by a Chicago policeman while he was walking away? Of course you do; who can forget it? Remember, too, that for 400 days the police kept the existence of the video secret and did nothing about the shooting. Meanwhile, the City of Chicago paid five million dollars to McDonald\u2019s family, who at that point had not filed a lawsuit. But despite the large sum of money coughed up by his own administration, Emanuel claims he never saw the video. If that\u2019s true, he was guilty of dreadful mismanagement; if he did know, he\u2019s guilty of far worse.\n\nOnly after his re-election was the cover-up of the murder revealed. In Pearlstein\u2019s words, \u201cGiven that he surely would not have been reelected had any of this come out before the balloting, a recent poll showed that only 17 percent of Chicagoans believe him. And a majority of Chicagoans now think he should resign.\u201d\n\nThe Laquan McDonald murder is just one of the scandals on Emanuel\u2019s watch: crime and abuse by police run rampant, the city\u2019s public schools are a disaster, the transit system\u2019s a mess. Yet while Emanuel has devoted little of his schedule to meeting with community leaders, Pearlstein reminds us that he did, however, \u201cspend enormous blocks of time with the rich businessmen, including Republicans, who had showered him with cash\u2026\u201d Now many of them have deserted him, including one of his richest Republican \u2014 yes, Republican\u2014 contributors, multimillionaire Bruce Rauner, who became governor of Illinois.", "article_metadata": {"description": "If Clinton cares at all about the future of her party, she must cut bait with two of her most corrupt disciples", "title": "Rahm and Debbie have to go: Why Hillary should be calling for their resignation", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "If Clinton cares at all about the future of her party, she must cut bait with two of her most corrupt disciples", "title": "Rahm and Debbie have to go: Why Hillary should be calling for their resignation", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2016/03/24/rahm_and_debbie_have_to_go_why_hillary_should_be_calling_for_their_resignation_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/03/wasserman_schultz_emanuel.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "If Clinton cares at all about the future of her party, she must cut bait with two of her most corrupt disciples", "title": "Rahm and Debbie have to go: Why Hillary should be calling for their resignation", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/03/wasserman_schultz_emanuel.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Bill Moyers and Michael Winship", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Bill Clinton, BillMoyers.com, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, Hillary Clinton, Rahm Emanuel", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcdd2d\"", "article_summary": "Topics: Bill Clinton, BillMoyers.com, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, Hillary Clinton, Rahm Emanuel, Elections News, Politics NewsThis piece originally appeared on BillMoyers.com.\nNo, she should come right out and ask for the resignations of Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel and Democratic National Committee Chair \u2014 and Florida congresswoman \u2014 Debbie Wasserman Schultz.\nThere are two Democrats whose resignation from office right now would do their party and country a service.\nBut despite the large sum of money coughed up by his own administration, Emanuel claims he never saw the video.\nMeanwhile, the City of Chicago paid five million dollars to McDonald\u2019s family, who at that point had not filed a lawsuit."}
