Gov. Rick Perry (R) has been a firm opponent of Medicaid expansion, going so far as to liken the policy to April Fool's Day.\n\n\"Seems to me April Fool's Day is the perfect day to discuss something as foolish as Medicaid expansion, and to remind everyone that Texas will not be held hostage by the Obama administration's attempt to force us into the fool's errand of adding more than a million Texans to a broken system,\" Perry told reporters in April 2013.\n\n\"It's really about his own ideological battle with the president of the United States,\" Sebelius said Tuesday in response to Perry's opposition. \"Unfortunately, in this case, people's health is at stake.\"\n\nAlso on HuffPost: The Obama Cabinet The Obama Cabinet\n\n1 of 22 Joe Biden, Vice President (Win McNamee/Getty Images) Share this slide:\n\nGetty", "article_metadata": {"description": "Secretary of Health and Human Services Kat...", "sailthru.expire_date": "2014-02-26 13:20:51 -0500", "og": {"site_name": "The Huffington Post", "description": "Secretary of Health and Human Services Kat...", "title": "Sebelius Hits GOP Governors For 'Playing Politics With People's Lives'", "url": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/02/25/kathleen-sebelius-governors_n_4854690.html", "image": "http://i.huffpost.com/gen/1643763/images/o-SEBELIUS-PERRY-facebook.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Secretary of Health and Human Services Kat...", "creator": "cgentilviso", "image": {"width": 2000, "identifier": "http://i.huffpost.com/gen/1643763/images/o-SEBELIUS-PERRY-facebook.jpg", "height": 1000}, "title": "Sebelius Hits GOP Governors For 'Playing Politics With People's Lives'", "site": "@HuffPostPol", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-02-25 13:20:51 -0500", "al": {"ios": {"url": "huffpostnews:///?editionID=us&entryID=4854690", "app_store_id": 306621789, "app_name": "The Huffington Post"}}, "taboola.category": "politics", "fb": {"app_id": 46744042133}, "keywords": "medicaid expansion,kathleen sebelius medicaid expansion,kathleen sebelius governors,kathleen sebelius rick perry,rick perry,kathleen sebelius medicaid", "article": {"section": "Politics", "tag": "medicaid expansion,kathleen sebelius medicaid expansion,kathleen sebelius governors,kathleen sebelius rick perry,rick perry,kathleen sebelius medicaid", "published_time": "2014-02-25 13:20:51 -0500", "modified_time": "2014-02-25 13:59:03 -0500"}, "viewport": "width=1000"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcad3d\"", "article_summary": "\"Unfortunately, what I think we have in a large case is governors playing politics with people's lives and people's health,\" Sebelius said.\nSecretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius lashed out at GOP governors on Tuesday for \"playing politics\" on Medicaid expansion.\n\"It's really about his own ideological battle with the president of the United States,\" Sebelius said Tuesday in response to Perry's opposition.\n\"Unfortunately, in this case, people's health is at stake.\"\nRick Perry (R) has been a firm opponent of Medicaid expansion, going so far as to liken the policy to April Fool's Day."}
