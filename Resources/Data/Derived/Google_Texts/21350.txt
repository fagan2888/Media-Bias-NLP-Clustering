Tropical Storm Gonzalo developed Sunday afternoon in the Atlantic Ocean off the Lesser Antilles Islands.



The current forecast cone shows the system moving toward the west-northwest in the coming days but shifting north before reaching the Bahamas. This means the expected path of the system is to push northward, avoiding Florida and the east coast of the United States.

Though Florida will avoid a direct impact from this tropical storm, islands including Guadeloupe, St. Maartin, Antigua and Barbuda, British Virgin Islands, U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico will be effected by the storm.

As of the Sunday late night update from the National Hurricane Center, Gonzalo is located more than 80 miles east-northeast of Guadeloupe with maximum sustained winds of 45 mph. The storm is moving west at 12 mph with a central pressure of 1002 mb.

Tropical Storm warnings are active for Guadeloupe, Desirade, Les Saintes, Marie Galante, St. Maartin, St. Barthelemy, St. Martin, Saba, St. Eustatius, Barbuda, Antigua, Antuilla, St. Kitts, Nevis and Montserrat.

Hurricane watches are active for Puerto Rico, Vieques, Culebra, U.S. Virgin Islands, and British Virgin Islands.

Tropical Storm Gonzalo is expected to strengthen into a category one hurricane early in the work week. The storm joins Tropical Storm Fay as active cyclones in the Atlantic Ocean. The former Hurricane Fay impacted the island of Bermuda in the Atlantic Ocean, but is moving away from the United States. It also does not pose a threat to Florida.
