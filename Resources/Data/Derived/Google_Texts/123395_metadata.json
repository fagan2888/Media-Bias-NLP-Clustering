The former president has recently gone on a defensive rant about his notorious crime bill, claiming that BLM protesters are \u201cdefending the people who kill the lives [they] say matter,\u201d and has condescendingly joked that Bernie Sanders supporters think you can \u201cshoot every third person on Wall Street and everything will be fine.\u201d\n\nOn Thursday, he once again put his foot in his mouth, this time blaming young voters, who tend to support Sanders over Hillary, for current economic disparities. \u201cThe reason that there\u2019s so much anxiety, intensity, anger, blame in this election is that 80 percent of the American people have not gotten a pay raise since the crash eight years ago, after inflation,\u201d said Clinton, at a rally in Pennsylvania. A valid observation, but Bill just couldn\u2019t help taking a swipe at all of those young voters who overwhelmingly support his wife\u2019s opponent: \u201cIf all the young people who claim to be disillusioned now had voted in 2010, we wouldn\u2019t have lost the Congress, and we\u2019d probably have our incomes back.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019ll win over millennials!\n\nOf course, it should be noted that a large percentage of today\u2019s youth vote was not even eligible to vote in 2010, and many other groups also failed to turnout in large numbers. Moreover, the independent vote, which shifted to the right that year, was the most important contributor to the Republican rout.\n\nStill, it\u2019s true that if voter turnout had been higher, Democrats would have done significantly better against Republicans. Indeed, Bernie Sanders has been making this point throughout his campaign.\n\nBut who is to blame for low turnout, which tends to be a consequence of political apathy and cynicism? First of all, the economy was still in deep red \u2014 which, in hindsight, was not a surprise, considering the world had just gone through the worst economic crisis in 80 years. While President Obama\u2019s stimulus package (along with Fed policies) had succeeded in rescuing the nosediving economy, it was far from robust, and with Democrats in control of the government, 2010 was inevitably going to be a tough midterm. (Today, there is virtually no debate among economists that the Recovery Act worked and prevented a depression \u2014 but Republicans unfortunately won the public relations battle.) Furthermore, there was large number of vulnerable seats in right-leaning areas, which made a GOP blowout all the more unavoidable.\n\nWhat tends to be forgotten, however, is the uninspiring platform that Democrats ran on in 2010. The Obama administration had done a lousy job selling the stimulus and the Affordable Care Act to the people, and the extreme right, funded by ideologue billionaires like the Koch brothers, capitalized on this with a deluge of anti-Obama propaganda and campaign funding for Tea Party candidates. (This was conveniently the first post-Citizens United election, allowing billionaires to spend millions on single candidates.) For many Democrats running for reelection \u2014 particularly in vulnerable swing vote areas \u2014 their platform was gloomy and sheepish. \u201cStimulus\u201d had become a dirty word, and Democratic politicians failed to defend the policies of Obama or fight for a progressive agenda. (Again, the Obama administration is largely to blame for these PR failures; even the president came across as doubtful at times.)", "article_metadata": {"description": "The 42nd president is a charming politician, but this year he's been more a liability than asset on the trail", "author": "Conor Lynch", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The 42nd president is a charming politician, but this year he's been more a liability than asset on the trail", "title": "Bill Clinton can\u2019t stop screwing up: Why his latest broadside against millennials reveals an underlying problem", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2016/04/25/bill_clinton_cant_stop_screwing_up_why_his_latest_broadside_against_millennials_reveals_an_underlying_problem/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/04/bill_clinton7.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The 42nd president is a charming politician, but this year he's been more a liability than asset on the trail", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/04/bill_clinton7.jpg", "title": "Bill Clinton can\u2019t stop screwing up: Why his latest broadside against millennials reveals an underlying problem", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Bill Clinton can\u2019t stop screwing up: Why his latest broadside against millennials reveals an underlying problem", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Bernie Sanders, Bill Clinton, Dem primary, Donald Trump, Elections 2016, Hillary Clinton", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Still, it\u2019s true that if voter turnout had been higher, Democrats would have done significantly better against Republicans.\nMoreover, the independent vote, which shifted to the right that year, was the most important contributor to the Republican rout.\nTopics: Bernie Sanders, Bill Clinton, Dem primary, Donald Trump, Elections 2016, Hillary Clinton, News, Politics NewsIf the Clinton campaign is hoping to get young people out to vote for Hillary in November, it may want to start thinking about sidelining one of its most well-known surrogates: her husband.\n(Again, the Obama administration is largely to blame for these PR failures; even the president came across as doubtful at times.)\nFor many Democrats running for reelection \u2014 particularly in vulnerable swing vote areas \u2014 their platform was gloomy and sheepish."}
