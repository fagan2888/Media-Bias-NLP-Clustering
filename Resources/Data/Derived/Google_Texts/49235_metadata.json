Nearly seventy percent acknowledge that the ACA will likely succeed in shifting the majority of reimbursements away from a fee-for-service structure and towards value-based accountable care, which will better align delivery reform efforts with payment.\n\nMore than a third of providers identified \u201cimproving patient outcomes\u201d as their top priority in the near future, and an additional 25 percent hope to focus on delivering a higher quality patient experience. Six percent added that implementing new information technology was their primary strategic objective, and eleven percent hope to expand their ambulatory or preventative care services.\n\nAs financial pressures and technical snafus make it more difficult for providers to squeeze in enough patients each day to turn a reasonable profit, organizations are turning to mHealth, telehealth, and other virtual communication tools to make it easier to consult with patients from afar.\n\nHalf of providers stated that most patients, apart from the acutely ill, do not actual require an in-person evaluation, and can be served equally well through remote electronic means.\n\nAlmost two-thirds of providers believe that virtual visits will be prevalent within the next three years, the survey found. Eighty-four percent predict that wearables, smartphone apps, and other Internet of Things devices will be common tools for recording vital signs and other data that can be reviewed by a provider at his or her leisure.\n\nClose to ninety percent think that patients will more frequently share their health data on social media platforms and with their acquaintances or friends. A similar number believe that patient engagement strategies, such as medication reminders, will be employed much more broadly to address some of the challenges of maintaining good health and lifestyle choices between provider contacts.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re finally getting our act together by integrating patients into their own healthcare by stressing health and wellness side-by-side with their very real responsibility in disease management,\u201d said one anonymous participant.\n\nCMS may have taken a step back on patient portal use with its Stage 2 modifications earlier this month, but the recognition that an engaged patient is a healthier, happier, more satisfied consumer transcends the regulatory approach of the EHR Incentive Programs \u2013 on both sides of the equation.\n\nWith the number of available wellness-focused wearable devices growing every day, and heavily promoted projects like Apple\u2019s HealthKit and ResearchKit attracting interest from tech-savvy millennials and academic research organizations alike, patient engagement is becoming a commonplace competency for consumers.\n\nHealthcare providers are still just starting to develop best practices for collecting and integrating this data into the workflow, but an interest in the value of patient-generated health data (PGHD) is growing as emerging initiatives like population health management and precision medicine demand a more thorough, intimate look at patient behaviors.\n\nProviders may benefit from embracing the Internet of Things patient engagement mentality by seeing costs drop by as much as twenty-five percent, a recent report predicted. With the potential to expand into a $50 billion industry by the end of the decade, the IoT will likely have a major impact on the continued optimism \u2013 or pessimism \u2013 of healthcare providers trying to navigate a new world of widespread industry reform.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Internet of Things will foster increased patient engagement in the next three years as providers look to the future of healthcare, a new survey says.", "author": "HealthITAnalytics", "og": {"url": "http://healthitanalytics.com/news/internet-of-things-patient-engagement-top-healthcare-priorities", "site_name": "HealthITAnalytics", "image": "http://healthitanalytics.com/images/site/articles/ThinkstockPhotos-484224025-2.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "Internet of Things, Patient Engagement Top Healthcare Priorities"}, "twitter": {"description": "The Internet of Things will foster increased patient engagement in the next three years as providers look to the future of healthcare, a new survey says.", "creator": "@HITAnalytics", "image": {"src": "http://healthitanalytics.com/images/site/articles/ThinkstockPhotos-484224025-2.jpg"}, "title": "Internet of Things, Patient Engagement Top Healthcare Priorities", "site": "@HITAnalytics", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd46a\"", "article_summary": "Providers may benefit from embracing the Internet of Things patient engagement mentality by seeing costs drop by as much as twenty-five percent, a recent report predicted.\nDeveloping a data-driven technical ecosystem that encourages patient engagement and produces better outcomes is high on the list of priorities for the majority of healthcare providers, says the 2015 Mortenson Healthcare Industry Study.\nClose to ninety percent think that patients will more frequently share their health data on social media platforms and with their acquaintances or friends.\nWith the number of available wellness-focused wearable devices growing every day, and heavily promoted projects like Apple\u2019s HealthKit and ResearchKit attracting interest from tech-savvy millennials and academic research organizations alike, patient engagement is becoming a commonplace competency for consumers.\nA similar number believe that patient engagement strategies, such as medication reminders, will be employed much more broadly to address some of the challenges of maintaining good health and lifestyle choices between provider contacts."}
