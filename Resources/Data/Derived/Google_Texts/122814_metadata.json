Beatty)\n\nWhen you ask James Monroe High School student Luz Gutierrez what she\u2019s been doing for the past week, she\u2019ll rattle off a long list of academic challenges and meetings with Oklahoma\u2019s top state officials, a retired army general and an Olympic gold medalist.\n\nGutierrez, who\u2019s enrolled in Monroe\u2019s Junior Reserve Officer Training Corps was selected as one of 50 students from around the nation and world to attend \u201cFour Star Leadership with General Tommy Franks\u201d in Oklahoma this week.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so intense; It\u2019s really rigorous,\u201d Gutierrez said. \u201cWe\u2019re doing congressional debates; and we have to write about minimum wage and Obamacare and economic national growth versus the impact of gas emissions.\u201d\n\nBut the highlight of Gutierrez\u2019s journey so far, she said, has been her trip to the governor\u2019s mansion where she met with the retired four-star general, Franks, along with Oklahoma\u2019s Lt. Gov. Todd Lamb.\n\n\u201cThe governor has a pool in her mansion; it\u2019s in the shape of Oklahoma and it\u2019s really neat,\u201d Gutierrez said.\n\nGutierrez arrived in Oklahoma on Sunday for the week-long academy, which wraps up Saturday. She was selected from a field of 500 applicants to attend the program with students from 30 other states and two countries, Germany and Jordan.\n\nRemarkably, Gutierrez is the second Monroe JROTC cadet to be accepted in two years, the school\u2019s senior army instructor and retired Sgt. 1st Class Charles Mujica said.\n\n\u201cTo me it\u2019s astounding that a student from the same school would be selected from all over California,\u201d Mujica said. \u201cI was real happy she was picked, because I didn\u2019t think we would stand a chance.\u201d\n\nThe program aims to help build the leaders of tomorrow by, among other things, exposing kids to the top business and political leaders of today, General Tommy Franks Leadership Institute and Museum Director Warren Martin said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a once in a lifetime opportunity to shake hands and meet these individuals who are leading our country and business.\u201d Martin said. \u201cOne-on-one interactions with current leaders is really what makes this camp unique.\u201d\n\nBefore the week is out, Gutierrez will have rubbed elbows with Oklahoma Gov. Mary Fallin, two-time Olympic Gold medalist Michele Smith, President and CEO of Musco Lighting Joe Crookham, a Pepsi executive, state representatives and others, Martin said.\n\nWhen she\u2019s not meeting leaders, the incoming senior is competing against her camp peers for $20,000 in college scholarships, which will be awarded to the best student in each of the following categories: congressional debate, persuasive writing, opinion-editorial writing and overall leadership.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs Gen. Franks would say, the idea is to teach students how to \u201cdisagree without being disagreeable,\u201d Martin said.\n\nSince starting in 2006, the leadership academy\u2019s alumni have gone on to attend Ivy League universities and top military schools, including West Point and the Air Force Academy, Martin said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking for some great things to come from our alumni in years to come,\u201d Martin said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "When you ask James Monroe High School student Luz Gutierrez what she\u2019s been doing for the past week, she\u2019ll rattle off a long list of academic challenges and meetings with Oklahoma\u2019s top state officials, a retired army general and", "title": "Monroe High School senior, JROTC cadet attending leadership program", "og": {"url": "http://www.dailynews.com/social-affairs/20140717/monroe-high-school-senior-jrotc-cadet-attending-leadership-program", "image": {"width": "1500px", "identifier": "http://www.dailynews.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/LA/20140717/NEWS/140719477/AR/0/AR-140719477.jpg?Maxh=1500&Maxw=1500", "height": "997px"}, "type": "article", "title": "Monroe High School senior, JROTC cadet attending leadership program"}, "twitter": {"domain": "dailynews.com", "description": "When you ask James Monroe High School student Luz Gutierrez what she\u2019s been doing for the past week, she\u2019ll rattle off a long list of academic challenges and meetings with Oklahoma\u2019s top state officials, a retired army general and", "title": "Monroe High School senior, JROTC cadet attending leadership program", "url": "http://www.dailynews.com/social-affairs/20140717/monroe-high-school-senior-jrotc-cadet-attending-leadership-program", "image": {"src": "http://www.dailynews.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/LA/20140717/NEWS/140719477/AR/0/AR-140719477.jpg?Maxh=900&Maxw=900"}, "site": "@ladailynews", "app": {"id": {"ipad": "id551745144", "iphone": "id502957174", "googleplay": "com.spreedinc.providers.digitalfirstmedia.ladailynews"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "keywords": "Education, Education news, Los Angeles Education news, CA Education news, US Education news, world Education news.", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Education, Education news, Los Angeles Education news, CA Education news, US Education news, world Education news."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3e84\"", "article_summary": "Incoming James Monroe High School senior Luz Gutierrez, left, listens to Warren Martin, executive director of the General Tommy Franks Leadership Institute and Museum, on Thursday, July 17, 2014.\nRemarkably, Gutierrez is the second Monroe JROTC cadet to be accepted in two years, the school\u2019s senior army instructor and retired Sgt.\n\u201cTo me it\u2019s astounding that a student from the same school would be selected from all over California,\u201d Mujica said.\n\u201cThe governor has a pool in her mansion; it\u2019s in the shape of Oklahoma and it\u2019s really neat,\u201d Gutierrez said.\nAdvertisementAs Gen.
