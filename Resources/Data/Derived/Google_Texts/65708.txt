CANBERRA, Australia (AP) - South Korea overcame the loss of star winger Lee Chung-yong to move to the brink of reaching the Asian Cup quarterfinals with a 1-0 win over Kuwait on Tuesday.

The South Koreans made seven changes from the lineup that opened with a 1-0 win over Oman, with injuries and illness forcing a reshuffle. Nam Tae-hee’s first-half header was enough to give two-time champion a second win and six points in Group A.

The Koreans had a setback before kickoff when it was confirmed Lee, who plays for English club Bolton, had fractured his shin and would fly home.

Lee was injured in the win over Oman last weekend. It is unlikely he will participate in the rest of the tournament, which finishes with the final on Jan. 31.

Right-back Kim Chang-soo has also failed to recover from his injury, while attacker Son Heung-min, midfielder Koo Ja-cheol and goalkeeper Kim Jin-hyun were all kept off the team due to sickness.

The replacements made heavy work of Kuwait, defeated 4-1 by Australia four days previously.

The only goal of the game came eight minutes before half-time when Nam headed home a perfect Cha Du-ri cross.

The second half was a tough one for the Koreans, on the back foot for the majority of it. A shot from Ali Al Maqseed hit the post early in the period and was a signal for an extended period of Kuwaiti pressure.

Despite plenty of possession, pressure and chances, Kuwait couldn’t find a way past South Korea goalkeeper Kim Seung-gyu.

Kuwait is almost certainly out of contention at the tournament following back-to-back defeats.

South Korea moves to Brisbane to face host Australia in the last group game on Saturday, when Kuwait meets Oman in Newcastle.
