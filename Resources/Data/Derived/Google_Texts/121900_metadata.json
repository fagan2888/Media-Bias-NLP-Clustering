Kennedy Airport to Salt Lake City Friday.\n\nThe liberal actor, who was en route to the Sundance Film Festival in Park City, Utah, to promote his latest movie (and Kickstarter project) \u201cWish You Were Here,\u201d noticed shortly before boarding that a former presidential candidate was lurking in the airport, likely bound for the same flight.\n\nMitt Romney just walked by me at JFK after I randomly tweeted him. Let's try this again: @PaulMcCartney \u2014 Zach Braff (@zachbraff) January 24, 2014\n\nAnd, sure enough, former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney was indeed about to board Braff\u2019s flight to Salt Lake City.\n\nI feel like the odds of me and @MittRomney being on the same flight to Salt Lake City are good. I shall report back. \u2014 Zach Braff (@zachbraff) January 24, 2014\n\nIncidentally enough, Braff had tweeted his whereabouts and that he was headed to Utah for Sundance shortly before seeing the former presidential candidate. But, in a weird bit of coincidence \u2013 the actor included Romney\u2019s Twitter handle in his tweet as if he wished deep down that the politician would be on his flight even before he knew it was a reality.\n\nHeaded back to Utah. @MittRomney #Sundance2014 \u2014 Zach Braff (@zachbraff) January 24, 2014\n\nTo give the story an even happier ending, the two ended up sitting together in first-class on the flight, thus having several hours of air time to bond and become besties for life (and chat about \u201cThe Hunger Games\u201d trilogy, of course.)\n\nSeat Mates: pic.twitter.com/kq4WfzVZNM \u2014 Zach Braff (@zachbraff) January 25, 2014\n\n.@zachbraff may the odds be ever in your favor. pic.twitter.com/7YzQwIeHaA \u2014 Mitt Romney (@MittRomney) January 25, 2014\n\nRomney had been in New York City to talk about the documentary \u201cMitt\u201d on the \u201cTODAY\u201d show Friday. \u201cMitt,\u201d which chronicles his two failed presidential campaigns, just had its cinematic debut at Sundance. It is now available on Netflix as well.\n\n\n\nWhile Braff and Romney now have a story for the ages in their midst, Braff did later send a tweet to his favorite politician \u2013 President Barack Obama \u2013 just to make sure he wasn\u2019t too jealous about the precious time he spent with Obama\u2019s one-time political rival.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "NGFB Pro 7.8.4U", "og": {"site_name": "Red Alert Politics", "description": "\"Garden State\" actor Zach Braff got much more than he wished for as he boarded a flight from New York's John F.
