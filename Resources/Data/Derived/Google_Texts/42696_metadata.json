The intention, said the president, was to get rid of \u201cexcessive, inconsistent, and redundant regulation\u201d and to \u201creduce the burdens regulations may place on small businesses.\u201d\n\nThe reinvention of Obama as the Great Deregulator was a little hard to swallow. Just a few months earlier, The New York Times had run a story (\u201cWith Obama, Regulations Are Back in Fashion\u201d) that described the \u201csurge in rule-making\u201d under the new Democratic administration and the complaints from industries as varied as home builders and toy makers about how \u201coverzealous\u201d regulators had become. Still, it was encouraging to hear a liberal president emphasize that \u201cregulations do have costs,\u201d and stress the importance of choosing the \u201cleast burdensome\u201d alternative when imposing mandates. Maybe the era of big regulation really was winding down?\n\nAh, if only.\n\nEach year the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a market-oriented think tank, compiles a report on federal regulation called \u201cTen Thousand Commandments.\u201d The latest iteration, just published, tallies the economic cost of compliance with regulatory decrees in America at $1.9 trillion annually. That\u2019s a sum so enormous that if \u201cfederal regulation\u201d were a country, it would boast the ninth-largest economy on earth, ranking between India and Russia.\n\nAccording to the Congressional Budget Office, federal spending in fiscal 2015 totaled nearly $3.7 trillion. So the bite taken by federal regulation out of the economy last year was equal to half the level of federal spending itself \u2014 in effect, a 50 percent hike in the price we pay to be ruled by Washington. The hidden regulatory \u201ctax\u201d on the average US household amounts to $14,842 per year. That\u2019s more than most families spend on anything in their budget except housing. \u201cMore is \u2018spent\u2019 on embedded regulation,\u201d writes Wayne Crews, the author of the CEI report, \u201cthan on health care, food, transportation, entertainment, apparel, services, and savings.\u201d What Obama said five years ago is truer than ever: \u201cRegulations do have costs.\u201d\n\nYet far from easing its grip, Washington is gearing up to squeeze even harder.\n\nThe Federal Register \u2014 the yearly compendium of proposed and finalized regulations \u2014 ran to more than 80,000 pages in 2015, the third time that has happened under the current administration. More red tape is in the pipeline: Nearly 3,300 unissued regulations are currently being finalized, and at least 218 of them will have an \u201ceconomically significant\u201d impact of $100 million or more. Yet virtually all will be imposed by federal agencies directly, with no congressional investigation or involvement, and no congressional vote.\n\nPolitical fights occasionally erupt over regulations that touch on sensitive religious or societal issues. An obvious, recent example is ObamaCare, with its health-insurance mandates and its compulsory \u201cfree\u201d coverage of birth control.\n\nBut no less important than the controversy regulations stir up is the economic anemia they induce. Not once has annual GDP growth under Obama reached 3 percent. How could it, with the economy shackled by so many new rules, restrictions, and regulations? In a recent paper, George Mason University economists calculated that if federal regulation had been locked at its 1980 level, the US economy in 2012 would have been 25 percent \u2014 $4 trillion \u2014 larger than it actually was. Twenty-five percent!\n\nObviously, wise regulation can yield important benefits. But Washington\u2019s horde of regulators isn\u2019t exactly known for its wisdom. And $4 trillion in forgone economic growth is huge. It adds up to a lot of underemployed Americans, a lot of struggling businesses, and a lot of disaffected voters.\n\nOverregulation hurts. It penalizes employers, paralyzes innovators, and thwarts economic growth. Presidents and their promises come and go, but the regulatory behemoth grows ever more bloated.\n\nJeff Jacoby is a columnist for The Boston Globe.", "article_metadata": {"description": "In 2011, President Obama signed an executive order directing federal agencies to scrutinize their rulebooks with an eye to removing outdated regulations that were smothering the economy. \"We are . . . making it our mission to root out regulations that conflict, that are not worth the cost, or that are just plain dumb,\" he explained at the time.
