Alec Baldwin took to Twitter to shame the minimum wage protesters who made his difficult New York life even harder Wednesday night by blocking traffic.

“Protestors have blocked off a huge quadrant of midtown traffic in support of a higher minimum wage. I support their goal, not their method,” the 57-year-old actor tweeted to his more than one million followers.

“Life in NY is hard enough as is. The goal is to not make it more so. How does clogging rush hour traffic from 59th St to 42 do any good?” he asked.

That prompted countless responses expressing skepticism about Mr. Baldwin’s hard life, causing him to lash out at one Twitter user, @OtisCooke, calling her a “class-ist nitwit.”

“NY’s ethos dissolves every day that individuals or groups put their needs/goals ahead of everyone else’s,” he tweeted. “There are ways to rally people to your cause without inconveniencing an entire City.”

Minimum wage workers in New York City marched Wednesday night calling for a wage increase from $8.75 to $15 an hour.
