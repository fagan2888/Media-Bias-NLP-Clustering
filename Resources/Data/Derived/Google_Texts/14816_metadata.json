Aasif Mandvi might be most famous for his hilarious commentary on The Daily Show, but he\u2019s also a very well-regarded actor, creator, artist, and writer.\n\nAt a time when we\u2019re not having a debate about Islam and extremism so much as we\u2019re slinging talking points past each other, Aasif Mandvi took time out of a very busy schedule to talk about Halal in the Family and much more.\n\nNamely: He teases us with glimpses into his upcoming HBO show, The Brink; his time with Jon Stewart on The Daily Show, and some valuable insights on the fine line between free speech and hate speech.\n\nI read your book, No Land\u2019s Man, [Note: You should too. It\u2019s wonderful.], and I\u2019ve watched Halal in the Family. What\u2019s sparked your interest in combating Islamophobia?\n\nWe did a piece on the Daily Show five years ago, sort of spawned by Katie Couric\u2019s saying American Muslims need their own Cosby Show, and we took that literally. We created this sketch, put it on the show, it was very funny and very popular, and that was the end of that.\n\nThen, years later, I was approached by my manager, Lillian LaSalle, with a company called Moore and Associates, and they said to me, \u201cIs there anything you want to talk about? Anything to make a social impact?\u201d I had been on the Daily Show for a number of years at this point, and spoken to a lot of Islamophobes, people who had a lot of misinformation about Islam and Muslims.\n\nIt was a personal thing to me, and it was an issue I thought I could lend my voice to in a satirical space.\n\nWere there any particular misconceptions or fears you wanted to address?\n\nThere was a lot of stuff about Shari\u2019ah Law, the protests against the mosques, the standard stuff\u2014the stories that kept coming up.\n\nYou work as an actor, a writer, a comedian, in a lot of creative spaces. What\u2019s the line between free speech and bigotry?\n\nWow. What is the line between free speech and bigotry? Look, there\u2019s always going to be free speech, and it\u2019s a fundamental right. We are allowed to speak our minds. But bigotry will always exist\u2014there will always be a certain amount of prejudice, and I don\u2019t think you can eradicate that. What I wanted to do was address some of that prejudice, the misinformation that gets put out there.\n\nYou can talk about and think about Muslims as you want, but you can\u2019t stop Muslims from building a mosque. You can hate Muslims from the comfort of your house, or publicly, but when that becomes stopping Muslims from building a mosque, or worshipping, then we are crossing the line into something else.\n\nHow do you feel Hollywood deals with diversity\u2014is it getting better, or is it getting worse?\n\nWe are definitely seeing more diversity today, in television and in movies. Probably more than we ever have. There are certainly more Asians, more South Asians, more people from the Middle East, portrayed on television today, as compared to when I started out.\n\nBut in Hollywood, Caucasian is still the norm. Your heroes are still Caucasian. So that is somewhere we need more diversity, in terms of who\u2019s creating the stories, who\u2019s starring in the stories, who the stories are about. You can have a lot of brown people, but if the story\u2019s really about white people, then it\u2019s diversity, but not the kind we need.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter, at the end of the day, that you have more brown people. Nobody\u2019s not watching a show because there\u2019s not enough brown people on it.\n\nYou mentioned, in No Land\u2019s Man, how you got the job on The Daily Show. It put you in a fascinating position. A lot of people in my generation turned to Jon Stewart for the news, and so they turned to you as a Muslim voice. They look at you as a spokesperson for Muslims. Do you then feel any responsibility to speak for Muslims? Does it limit you, or pressure you, in any way?\n\nIt\u2019s not a responsibility that I chose to take on. It\u2019s something that happened in the culture because there are so few Muslim voices, so few faces, so little representation. It became a thing: \u201cYou\u2019re our friendly Muslim guy.\u201d And because of the nature of what the Daily Show was.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The \"Daily Show\" alumnus on diversity in mainstream movies, Jon Stewart's departure and his new show on HBO", "title": "Aasif Mandvi: \u201cHollywood\u2019s heroes are still Caucasian\u201d", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The \"Daily Show\" alumnus on diversity in mainstream movies, Jon Stewart's departure and his new show on HBO", "title": "Aasif Mandvi: \u201cHollywood\u2019s heroes are still Caucasian\u201d", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/06/14/aasif_mandvi_hollywoods_heroes_are_still_caucasian_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/06/AP442194323188-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The \"Daily Show\" alumnus on diversity in mainstream movies, Jon Stewart's departure and his new show on HBO", "title": "Aasif Mandvi: \u201cHollywood\u2019s heroes are still Caucasian\u201d", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/06/AP442194323188-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Haroon Moghul", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, HBO, Jon Stewart, Religion Dispatches, the brink, The Daily Show", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Look, there\u2019s always going to be free speech, and it\u2019s a fundamental right.\nTopics: HBO, Jon Stewart, Religion Dispatches, the brink, The Daily Show, Entertainment NewsThis article originally appeared on Religion DispatchesThis couldn\u2019t be a more topical interview.\nAasif Mandvi might be most famous for his hilarious commentary on The Daily Show, but he\u2019s also a very well-regarded actor, creator, artist, and writer.\nWhat\u2019s the line between free speech and bigotry?\nWhat is the line between free speech and bigotry?"}
