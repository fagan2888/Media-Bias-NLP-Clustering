Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. speaks at a news conference in Washington, Sunday, May 1, 2016. (AP Photo/Cliff Owen)\n\nTERRE HAUTE, Ind. (AP) \u2014 The 2016 presidential campaign rumbled through Indiana Sunday focused on Tuesday\u2019s critical primary, even as front-runners Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump itched to fully engage in the one-on-one battle they cast as inevitable.\n\nBut the underdogs in both parties made clear they had no plans to exit the race, at least until the Indiana results come in \u2014 and perhaps longer.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going the distance,\u201d Trump rival Ted Cruz said on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week,\u201d arguing that Trump won\u2019t be able to get the majority of delegates required to clinch the nomination. \u201cWe\u2019re going into Cleveland, and it will be a contested convention.\u201d\n\nOn the Democratic side, Bernie Sanders insisted that his path to the nomination depends on the unlikely prospect of flipping superdelegates who are now committed to Clinton. Superdelegates can vote for the candidate they prefer. The former secretary of state is still 91 percent of the way to the nomination, according to The Associated Press. She is 218 delegates away from winning the 2,383 need to clinch the nomination.\n\n\u201cWe have an uphill climb, no question about it,\u201d he said, before hopping a plane to Indiana to continue his campaign.\n\nAnd so the stalemate between the front-runners and their struggling rivals continued.\n\nThe frustration was dramatic on the Republican side. Campaigning in Fort Wayne, Indiana, Trump again reiterated that he believes the GOP race is over even though he does not yet have the 1,237 delegates needed to clinch the nomination, and he mocked Cruz and Ohio Gov. John Kasich for failing to exit the race.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re hanging by their fingernails,\u201d said Trump, who urged the party to come together behind his candidacy. But even if it doesn\u2019t, he said, he expects to be the Republican nominee.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like to see the party pull together,\u201d Trump said. \u201cNow if it doesn\u2019t pull together, I think I\u2019m still going to win.\u201d\n\nAt an earlier rally in Terre Haute, Indiana, Trump groused that his rivals were forcing him into \u201cwasting time\u201d that he could otherwise spend raising \u201cmoney for the Senate races.\u201d\n\nThat overt offer of fundraising is new for Trump, incentive for Republican leaders to help push Cruz and Kasich out of the race. Senior adviser Paul Manafort further telegraphed the message Sunday on CBS\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation,\u201d saying that Trump is looking to strengthen ties to \u201cleaders of the Republican Party and various committees to help raise money for them.\u201d\n\nClinton, in Indianapolis, did not bother mentioning Sanders\u2019 name. Instead, she criticized Trump for embracing GOP economic policies that have left everyday workers behind. And she took aim at both Trump and Cruz for wanting to \u201cslash taxes on the wealthy\u201d and for using \u201cdangerous\u201d rhetoric about Muslims.\n\nCruz wasn\u2019t surrendering to the delegate math, even after a tough week in which former House Speaker John Boehner called him \u201cLucifer in the flesh\u201d and \u201ca miserable son of a bitch.\u201d Cruz pointed out on several political talk shows that Indiana Gov. Mike Pence and former California Gov. Pete Wilson have endorsed him and that Trump can\u2019t get a majority of Republicans to back him.\n\nThe Cruz campaign has put an emphasis on Indiana and a loss here could be perceived as crippling to his campaign, which is perhaps why the candidate himself has shifted to talking about competing in next month\u2019s California primary and beyond.\n\nTrump dominated the talk show conversation Sunday. On ABC, the first question posed to former CIA director and defense secretary Robert Gates was about what a Trump candidacy would mean for the nation\u2019s national security.\n\n\u201cI think based on the speech, you\u2019d have somebody who doesn\u2019t understand the difference between a business negotiation and a negotiation with sovereign powers,\u201d Gates, who has worked for both Republican and Democratic presidents, replied.\n\nMeanwhile, Sanders was facing a new round of questions about why he was even still running.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s difficult, it\u2019s not impossible,\u201d Sanders said on CBS\u2019s \u201cFace the Nation\u201d of his increasingly bleak challenge to Clinton.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The underdogs in both parties have made it clear that they have no plans to exit the race, at least until the Indiana results come in.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.mediageneral.wkrn", "og": {"site_name": "WKRN.com", "description": "The underdogs in both parties have made it clear that they have no plans to exit the race, at least until the Indiana results come in.", "title": "Campaign rumbles into Indiana with underdogs struggling", "url": "http://wkrn.com/2016/05/01/campaign-rumbles-into-indiana-with-underdogs-struggling/", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "https://mgtvwkrn.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/bernies.jpg", "height": 360}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The underdogs in both parties have made it clear that they have no plans to exit the race, at least until the Indiana results come in.", "creator": "@WKRN", "image": {"src": "https://mgtvwkrn.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/bernies.jpg?w=640"}, "title": "Campaign rumbles into Indiana with underdogs struggling", "site": "wkrn", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "Nashville's News 2", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=523213092", "fb": {"pages": 121386074555790}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "application-name": "WKRN.com", "google-site-verification": "G2WXEm6QW1PkffhJXpGnD-Yn9z2aSfnZHNVXc1bnnRo", "msvalidate.01": "25404283363C09DE121A55A903F03873", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wkrntv", "published_time": "2016-05-01T22:33:07+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-05-01T22:35:17+00:00"}, "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://wkrn.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/90919f996ff323fc31b4cb1f4b7e825e?s=16"}, "article_summary": "\u201cWe have an uphill climb, no question about it,\u201d he said, before hopping a plane to Indiana to continue his campaign.\nBut the underdogs in both parties made clear they had no plans to exit the race, at least until the Indiana results come in \u2014 and perhaps longer.\nThe former secretary of state is still 91 percent of the way to the nomination, according to The Associated Press.\nAnd she took aim at both Trump and Cruz for wanting to \u201cslash taxes on the wealthy\u201d and for using \u201cdangerous\u201d rhetoric about Muslims.\n\u201cIt\u2019s difficult, it\u2019s not impossible,\u201d Sanders said on CBS\u2019s \u201cFace the Nation\u201d of his increasingly bleak challenge to Clinton."}
