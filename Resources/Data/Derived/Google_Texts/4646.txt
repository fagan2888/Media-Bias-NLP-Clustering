A new report has ranked the United States healthcare system the poorest among 11 nations assessed by The Commonweath Fund.



According to a new report from The Commonwealth Fund, titled "Mirror, Mirror on the Wall, 2014 Update: How the U.S. Health Care System Compares Internationally," the U.S healthcare system is the most costly in the world, but it ranks poorly compared to other countries on most measures of performance, writes Science Recorder.



The Commonwealth analyzed healthcare systems in 11 countries including Australia, Canada, France, Germany, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, the UK and the U.S.



The United States was ranked last in the report - the same ranking as in the four previous editions of the report.



The healthcare system in the UK was ranked to be the best, followed closely by the Switzerland.



Unlike the system in the United States, five other nations in this report ensure the accessibility of care through universal health systems, including the UK, Australia and New Zealand.



While the Obamacare system is increasing the number of Americans with coverage and enhancing access to care - the data in this report is based on years prior to the full implementation of the law, writes Science Recorder.



The report also showed that the United States ranks behind most countries on many measures of health outcomes, quality and efficiency.



Health information sharing systems are commonplace in many other countries analyzed in the report, but United States doctors and hospitals are catching up as they react to major monetary incentives to switch to new health information technology systems, writes Science Recorder.



The report noted that all countries show the need for improvement, but the report notes that the other 10 countries spend less on healthcare per person and as a percent of gross domestic product than does the United States.
