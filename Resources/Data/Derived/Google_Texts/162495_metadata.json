But either his plan or Clinton\u2019s can bring about real reform\n\nDuring Thursday\u2019s debate, the two candidates for the Democratic nomination were offered the opportunity to engage one another\u2019s ideas for the path forward on health care reform. In the last few weeks, Bernie Sanders has advocated for a \u201csingle payer\u201d system to replace the Affordable Care Act, which Hillary Clinton has said has no chance of passing Congress and would mean scrapping a flawed but useful system that could instead be reformed.\n\nOn Thursday night, Clinton stated that she had been \u201cfighting for universal coverage\u201d for many years, but that rather than starting over from scratch that \u201cwe should build on what we have.\u201d Bernie Sanders countered, correctly, that every other liberal democracy has provided universal health care for much less money than the United States spends, and that the American system still falls far short of this standard.\n\nHere\u2019s the thing: they\u2019re really both right. Sanders is correct that while the Affordable Care Act was a major progressive achievement, the American health care system still insures too few people for far too much money, and considerably more needs to be done. And Clinton is right that the it\u2019s possible to build European-style health care out of the framework created by the ACA.\n\nThe key to fixing our system, though, is to understand that single-payer is far from the only model \u2013 and it\u2019s not the same as \u201cuniversal coverage\u201d.\n\nSince Sanders released his single-payer plan, it has come under attack from some critics for being vague and unrealistic; his supporters have responded that expecting a high level of policy detail in a campaign proposal is unrealistic. Sanders defenders have a point: campaign policy proposals that make implausibly optimistic assumptions and ignore downsides are more the rule than the exception.\n\nThe details of the 2008 Democratic candidates\u2019 proposed health care proposals were important then because there was a reasonable chance that something would actually pass; the same cannot be said for the chance of passing a major overhaul in 2017.\n\nThe problem with Sanders\u2019s single payer proposal isn\u2019t that it is too vague to allow voters to assess its feasibility and its flaws. The problem with his plan is that it reinforces the idea that European-style universal health care is synonymous with \u201csingle payer\u201d; that is simply untrue. There are models that deliver similar or better results than single payer systems, and they are more politically viable within the American system.\n\nIn terms of viability, it\u2019s vital to understand the massive economic disruption that implementing single payer in this day and age would cause, and how that would make it a political non-starter regardless of which party controlled Congress. As Paul Starr argued recently in the American Prospect, when President Truman proposed universal health insurance, health care costs were only 4% of GDP; had the US gotten single payer then, health care would be much less costly today. Since then, however, health care costs have ballooned, and that makes a public takeover of the health insurance industry far more difficult.\n\nFrom the Social Security Act t o the Affordable Care Act, major progressive reform in the United States has always involved compromises to buy off vested interests. And, even in countries where there are fewer institutional mechanisms to thwart change, medical lobbies have serious influence. Even with the advantages of a political system that makes it easier for major reforms to pass, nationalized health care was able to pass in the UK only because Labour Health Minister Aneurin Bevan \u201cstuffed the mouths\u201d of medical practitioners \u201cwith gold\u201d. It\u2019s one thing to do that in the UK in 1948; the amount of gold that would have to be stuffed into the millions of mouths of the American health industry to make single payer viable in the 21st century would require insanely high (and obviously politically unsustainable) levels of taxation and would also defeat much of the purpose of converting to single payer in the first place.\n\nTo implement a single payer health care system from scratch in 2017 would mean not only nationalizing the insurance industry, but severely cutting payments to doctors, hospitals and other areas of the health care industry if it were to bring any cost savings. A lot of people working for politically powerful lobbies would be thrown out of work or bankrupted, and many others would be looking at whopping pay cuts; that would never be politically viable even if it was desirable as policy.\n\nTo put it another way, single payer in the contemporary US faces intertwined political and policy problems that are insurmountable. The effects of the lack of cost controls in the American system for decades can\u2019t be undone overnight.\n\nStill, the fact that single payer is probably politically unviable shouldn\u2019t stop anyone from focusing on single payer as a long-term goal if it was the only way of achieving real universal health care. But it\u2019s not.\n\nMany liberal democracies, including Switzerland, France and Germany, have achieved true universal coverage with hybrid public/private models. The Netherlands actually changed its single-payer system to a hybrid system in 2006. When compared to single-payer Canada, the hybrid models in general rank better in quality and efficiency and are as or more equitable. And like single-payer, they deliver better results for far less money than the US spends.\n\nParticularly given that there\u2019s no way that single-payer would be as cheap in the US as it is in Canada, single payer is probably less desirable than the hybrid model even if we ignore the former\u2019s political unfeasibility.\n\nBut Sanders and Clinton are right that, in the long term, something at least approaching European-style universal health care is possible. Many countries have built excellent health care systems out of better versions of the ACA model: expanded (and in the case of Medicaid, improved) public insurance combined with better-regulated and subsidized private markets. Progress can be made towards this incrementally, as Clinton has proposed; it can be done in another big statute but it doesn\u2019t have to be.\n\nIf we\u2019re going to get to universal coverage, though, liberals need to get beyond conflating \u201csingle payer\u201d and \u201cEuropean-style health care.\u201d (And I\u2019ve been as guilty of that as anyone.) Universal health coverage is a case in which Sanders\u2019s idealism and Clinton\u2019s realism can in fact end up in the same place.\n\nBut when thinking about Sanders\u2019 as-yet vague health care reform proposal, progressives who want reform \u2013 and maybe even Sanders himself \u2013 need to be committed to its goal of universal coverage rather than being strictly committed to any particular path like \u201csingle payer\u201d.\n\nguardian.co.uk \u00a9 Guardian News and Media 2016", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": {"width": 800, "identifier": "http://www.rawstory.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Medical-Doctor-With-Pills-Shutterstock-800x430.jpg", "height": 430}, "title": "Americans don\u2019t need single payer health care to get universal coverage"}, "fb": {"app_id": 212555972273585}, "viewport": "width=device-width, user-scalable=yes, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=0.1, maximum-scale=10.0"}, "article_summary": "The problem with his plan is that it reinforces the idea that European-style universal health care is synonymous with \u201csingle payer\u201d; that is simply untrue.\nStill, the fact that single payer is probably politically unviable shouldn\u2019t stop anyone from focusing on single payer as a long-term goal if it was the only way of achieving real universal health care.\nAs Paul Starr argued recently in the American Prospect, when President Truman proposed universal health insurance, health care costs were only 4% of GDP; had the US gotten single payer then, health care would be much less costly today.\nIf we\u2019re going to get to universal coverage, though, liberals need to get beyond conflating \u201csingle payer\u201d and \u201cEuropean-style health care.\u201d (And I\u2019ve been as guilty of that as anyone.)\nUniversal health coverage is a case in which Sanders\u2019s idealism and Clinton\u2019s realism can in fact end up in the same place."}
