His job is to uphold and defend our constitution, not to make policy,\" Jones said. \"...Today, I have personally called upon Attorney General Koster and asked him, in writing, to defend our state\u2019s constitution or to appoint someone in his place who is capable and able of doing so.\u201d\n\nJones said in an interview that he has asked the House legal staff to review whether there is something the chamber can do to counter Koster's decision. Possible options may be to seek to hire a special counsel to challenge the judge's ruling, or for the House to intervene in the case, the speaker said.\n\nKoster accused of ignoring own pledge\n\nOrtwerth and Dempsey, among others, accuse Koster of running afoul of his promise in June to defend Missouri\u2019s laws, even though he disagreed with some of them. Koster appeared at the time to be referring specifically to Missouri\u2019s constitutional amendment that bans same-sex marriages, passed overwhelmingly by voters in 2004.\n\nOrtwerth said that the federal Defense of Marriage Act (known as DOMA for short) allows individual states to decline to recognize same-sex marriages performed in other states and that Koster is ignoring that avenue for political reasons.\n\n\u201cWhy is that?\u201d Ortwerth wrote. \u201cWell, the answer is pretty simple. Chris Koster badly wants to be elected as Missouri's next governor. It is an article of faith in his political party that any candidate for higher office must genuflect at the altar of the homosexual rights movement. Koster has now done so in the most symbolic way possible.\u201d\n\nThe heat directed at Koster may stem, in part, from his scathing public criticism of the GOP\u2019s stands on social issues when he left the Republican Party in 2007, shortly before launching his successful statewide bid as a Democrat for attorney general in 2008.\n\nKoster added fuel to the conservative fire in June, when he underscored his support for gay rights and same-sex marriage in his keynote address at Missouri Democrats\u2019 annual Jefferson-Jackson Dinner.\n\n\u201cHopefully, the Republican Party will scrub the discriminatory language from their party\u2019s platform,\u201d Koster said.\n\nBut he pivoted a few days later by issuing a more middle-of-the-road statement: \u201cWhile I personally support the goal of marriage equality, my duty as attorney general is to defend the laws of the state of Missouri. While many people in Missouri have changed their minds regarding marriage equality, Missourians have yet to change their constitution.\u201d\n\nDespite the rise of conservative attacks, Koster so far has declined to make any additional public comments on the matter -- or his decision regarding the judge's order.\n\nSilence from Republican candidates speaks volumes\n\nKoster may be getting help from the political wind at his back when it comes to gay rights. That wind is flying in the face of many conservatives.\n\nAs a result, social conservatives are having trouble keeping many of their own candidates in line.\n\nFor example: None of Missouri\u2019s potential Republican candidates for governor \u2013 including announced contender Catherine Hanaway \u2013 has issued public statements about Koster\u2019s latest decision, or highlighted their own views on same-sex marriage.\n\nTheir reticence appears to underscore how wary some politicians have become about gay-rights issues, in part because polls show that the public\u2019s opinion has swiftly become more sympathetic to the LGBT community.\n\nBut George Connor, head of the political science department at Missouri State University, said that the national shift doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that Missouri voters are in lockstep. He predicts that Missouri may end up being one of the last strongholds for gay-rights opponents.\n\n\u201cI think the conservativeness of the state still points to gay marriage being something that will be a problem for a statewide candidate more than a benefit,\u201d Connor said.\n\nKoster, he added, faces a dilemma. To win a race for governor will require Koster, or any Democratic statewide candidate, to attract strong urban support. But he also will need not to lose too badly in Republican-leaning rural areas and at least to break even in the state\u2019s swing suburbs.\n\nThat strategic map is cited as a key reason Koster chose to rile animal-rights groups (which generally lean Democratic) by backing this summer\u2019s \u201cright to farm\u2019\u2019 constitutional amendment that curbs state and local regulations. Backers had made it clear one aim was to block any future attempts to restrict dog breeding or large hog facilities.\n\nOpponents of the amendment, including former Lt. Gov. Joe Maxwell, blame Koster for the proposal's narrow victory Aug. 5.\n\nKoster also has a mixed record on gun-rights issues and had opposed in court some provisions of the federal Affordable Care Act, the domestic cornerstone of President Barack Obama's tenure.\n\nTo keep wary progressives in his fold, Connor argued that Koster now has little choice on the gay-marriage issue.\n\n\u201cThe bulk of his decision (on the judge\u2019s ruling) was a political one,\u2019\u2019 the professor said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s a decision that, for Koster, has to be made.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"category": "Politics & Issues", "description": "(Updated noon, Thursday, Oct. 9) Although a number of Missouri\u2019s top Republicans are blasting state Attorney General Chris Koster over same-sex marriage,", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://news.stlpublicradio.org/post/koster-again-under-fire-over-his-support-gay-marriage", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/kwmu/files/styles/medium/public/CHRISKOSTER12_%282%29.JPG", "type": "article", "description": "(Updated noon, Thursday, Oct. 9) Although a number of Missouri\u2019s top Republicans are blasting state Attorney General Chris Koster over same-sex marriage,", "title": "Koster Again Under Fire Over His Support Of Gay Marriage"}, "story_id": 354715915, "twitter": {"site": "@stlpublicradio", "card": "summary", "creator": "@jmannies"}, "author": "Jo Mannies", "org_id": 0, "dc": {"title": "Koster Again Under Fire Over His Support Of Gay Marriage"}, "nid": 40211, "datePublished": "2014-10-08", "keywords": "Chris Koster, gay marriage, Strictly Politics", "wordCount": 1181, "has_audio": 0, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "Koster added fuel to the conservative fire in June, when he underscored his support for gay rights and same-sex marriage in his keynote address at Missouri Democrats\u2019 annual Jefferson-Jackson Dinner.\n(Updated noon, Thursday, Oct. 9)Although a number of Missouri\u2019s top Republicans are blasting state Attorney General Chris Koster over same-sex marriage, it\u2019s unclear what his critics plan to do about it.\nOrtwerth\u2019s headline declared, \u201cAttorney General Ditches Legal Defense of Missouri Marriage Laws.\u201dOn Thursday, state House Speaker Tim Jones, R-Eureka, weighed in with his own criticisms.\nTo win a race for governor will require Koster, or any Democratic statewide candidate, to attract strong urban support.\nBut George Connor, head of the political science department at Missouri State University, said that the national shift doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that Missouri voters are in lockstep."}
