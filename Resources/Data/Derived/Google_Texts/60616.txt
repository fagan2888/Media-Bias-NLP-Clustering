Over 400 people registered for the run at Fort Walton Beach Landing for Autism Society of Emerald Coast.

Hundreds of volunteers helped with the event that started at 9 a.m. Saturday.

There were eight color stations where runners or walkers were splashed with colors.

All ages participated and some even brought their dogs.

The organization hopes to spread awareness about the important issue.

"we're going to be supporting camp activities for children with autism, social events for adults and teenagers with autism, and we also support the local schools,‚Äù said Myra Fowler, Autism Society of Emerald Coast.

Organizers are hoping to raise enough money for the organization.

There was also a festival where families could enjoy food and games.
