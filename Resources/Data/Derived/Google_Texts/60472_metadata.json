But the millions of Americans who will be forced into the exchange will not get employer subsidies to contribute to the cost of their exchange policy. That\u2019s in Obamacare. That\u2019s the law.\n\nRecently, in a classic case of Washington protecting its own, the Obama administration announced an illegal administrative fix for this provision regarding Congress, in order to take all of the sting out. This special rule, with no basis in the Obamacare statute, would allow members of Congress to keep most or all of their staff members off the exchange entirely. Members of Congress who do decide to go on the exchange would get a huge taxpayer-funded subsidy (about $5,000 for single workers or about $10,000 for families) unavailable to all other Americans at the same income levels going on the exchange. This creates a special Obamacare exemption for members of Congress and congressional staff.\n\nThe Obamacare statute states very clearly that all members of Congress and their staffs are to procure their health insurance through the Obamacare exchange. Just as clearly, it does not provide for government support of their present coverage under the separate Federal Employees Health Benefits Plan to continue on the exchange. In fact, Section 1512 of the statute says clearly that employees going on the exchange lose their previous employer subsidies. That\u2019s why this special rule for Congress is illegal.\n\nFolks in Washington are arguing that the political class deserves some extra help when faced with the onerous costs of health care. They\u2019re ignoring the harsh reality the rest of America faces. Eight million Americans are losing their employer contribution to their health care.\n\nTo bring Washington back to the rest of America, I\u2019ve introduced legislation that would end its Obamacare exemption. It would reverse the illegal Office of Personnel Management rule by requiring all members of Congress, the president, the vice president, and all political appointees in the administration to purchase their health insurance on the Obamacare exchange \u2014 without the help of special taxpayer-funded subsidies.\n\nOf course, lots of folks in the U.S. Senate feel deeply threatened by my legislation. Majority Leader Harry Reid has taken to name-calling, saying I\u2019m an \u201canarchist\u201d and \u201cmean-spirited.\u201d He and Senate Democrats want so badly to protect their illegal Obamacare exemption that they\u2019re trying to bribe members of Congress by threatening to take away the subsidy for folks who support my amendment while preserving it for those who oppose the amendment. It\u2019s clear that they\u2019re nervous about the idea of actually having to live under all of the Obamacare provisions themselves.\n\nIf Democrats in Washington are going to force Obamacare on the rest of America, they need to live by its provisions, too.
