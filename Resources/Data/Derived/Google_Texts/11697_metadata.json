The Broncos return to the scene Sunday, only this time it will be against the woebegone 2014 New York Jets, not the mighty 2013 Seattle Seahawks.\n\nIt\u2019s not the where, but the who.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s not going to be a stadium revenge,\u201d said Broncos coach John Fox. \u201cWe were 1-1 in that stadium last year. We\u2019re 0-0 there this year.\u201d\n\nThe Broncos drilled the sorry New York Giants 41-23 in regular-season game No. 2 last year in East Rutherford, N.J. It was the Broncos who had to apologize for their pitiful Super Bowl performance there Feb. 2.\n\nThe new who for Jersey\u2019s football fans Sunday will be the players on the Broncos\u2019 defense. Seven defensive starters, and nine of the Broncos\u2019 top 14 defensive players, didn\u2019t play in the 43-8 Meadowlands Massacre.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re going to see a difference,\u201d said Broncos safety Rahim Moore.\n\nThe four remaining Broncos defensive starters from the Super Bowl: defensive tackles Terrance Knighton and Sylvester Williams, linebackers Danny Trevathan and Nate Irving. A fifth Super Bowl starter, Malik Jackson, plays half the snaps off the bench this year.\n\nThat\u2019s it.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s crazy, man,\u201d Williams said. \u201cWe\u2019re ready to go back out there. We didn\u2019t win there the last time, but we got some new tools in the offseason and we\u2019re ready to go.\u201d\n\nThe changes in Denver\u2019s defensive personnel:\n\nRight defensive end: Ware instead of Shaun Phillips. Ware was signed as a free agent and has three sacks. Phillips left as a free agent and has zero for Tennessee.\n\nLeft defensive end: Derek Wolfe instead of Jackson. Wolfe missed the final eight games, including the postseason, because of seizurelike symptoms. Jackson is a top defensive line backup.\n\nStrongside linebacker: Von Miller instead of Irving. Miller was out with a torn ACL. He has four sacks in four games this season. Irving is now the Broncos\u2019 starting middle linebacker, replacing Paris Lenon, whose career probably is finished.\n\nLeft cornerback: Aqib Talib instead of Champ Bailey. Talib signed as a free agent and is widely considered one of the league\u2019s top five cover corners. Bailey has since been twice released and is unemployed.\n\nRight cornerback: Chris Harris instead of Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie. Although D.R.C. is a terrific cover corner, he is making $10.73 million this year. Harris, who was out with a torn ACL, is a better all-around football player and is making $1.43 million.\n\nNickel back: Bradley Roby instead of Tony Carter. Roby, a first-round draft pick, is playing well. Carter has been inactive in two of the first four games this season.\n\nStrong safety: T.J. Ward instead of Duke Ihenacho. Ward is the only Bronco who has been on the field for all 296 defensive snaps. Ihenacho was cut and suffered a season-ending foot injury in Washington.\n\nFree safety: Moore instead of Mike Adams. Moore missed the Super Bowl with a lower leg circulatory disorder. He has two interceptions in five games, while Adams has two picks in six games with Indianapolis.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m definitely appreciative of having this chance to go back to that stadium,\u201d Moore said. \u201cThat was one of the worst days of my life not being healthy, not being able to perform and help our guys in that game.\u201d\n\nTop backup defensive tackle: Marvin Austin instead of Mitch Unrein. Austin has been playing 25 percent of the snaps. Unrein has been inactive in three of four games.\n\nThe Broncos return to MetLife Stadium with two distinct changes: The Jets aren\u2019t the Seahawks. And the Broncos aren\u2019t the Broncos, at least not on defense.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s totally different, man,\u201d Knighton said as he dished out Italian meals to his teammates Friday. \u201cI don\u2019t know \u2026 I\u2019m \u2026\u201d\n\nI had accomplished the impossible. I had picked a subject Knighton didn\u2019t want to discuss. \u201cI\u2019m just tired of talking about Seattle, man,\u201d he said.\n\nMike Klis: mklis@denverpost.com or twitter.com/mikeklis", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Klis: Broncos\u2019 defense won\u2019t look familiar to MetLife", "title": "Klis: Broncos\u2019 defense won\u2019t look familiar to MetLife", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/10/11/klis-broncos-defense-wont-look-familiar-to-metlife/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141012__sp12FBNBRONX__HHR7598p1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141012__sp12FBNBRONX__HHR7598p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-10-11T18:44:25+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T21:01:42+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "The four remaining Broncos defensive starters from the Super Bowl: defensive tackles Terrance Knighton and Sylvester Williams, linebackers Danny Trevathan and Nate Irving.\nIt was the Broncos who had to apologize for their pitiful Super Bowl performance there Feb. 2.\n\u201cThey\u2019re going to see a difference,\u201d said Broncos safety Rahim Moore.\nWard is the only Bronco who has been on the field for all 296 defensive snaps.\nA fifth Super Bowl starter, Malik Jackson, plays half the snaps off the bench this year."}
