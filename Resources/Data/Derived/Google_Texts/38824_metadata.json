And in a not-so-surprising move less than three days after the November midterms, a conservative Supreme Court announced that it would be taking a look at the ACA yet again, this time on the question of federal subsidies for state exchanges.\n\nNow, by design, you have a high court faking that it\u2019s not political, when it\u2019s really huddling with a GOP-dominated Congress that\u2019s less interested in policymaking\u2014and more interested in throwing up roadblocks to Obama\u2019s health-coverage law.\n\nDon\u2019t worry, folks\u2014the law isn\u2019t going anywhere. Waste-of-time House hearings spent grilling once-unknown White House health care advisers like Jonathan Gruber are just drama to keep us confused during the ACA open-enrollment period. Republicans just get closer to splitting the difference with exhausted Democrats, and then keep winning more elections (keep your eye on the Kentucky and Louisiana gubernatorial races next year).\n\nExpect the Supreme Court to nix subsidies while Congress obliterates Medicaid and the individual mandates. \u201cThat alone is enough to bring down the health care law,\u201d Sen. John Barrasso (R-Wyo.) told Politico recently. \u201cWe\u2019re going to continue to try to, one, repeal; two, strip out the worst parts of the law; and three, look to the courts.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s one common theme: Cut that poor (black and brown) people, welfare-looking stuff, since, let\u2019s face it, they aren\u2019t our political constituency in the first place. Never mind that poor white people, most of whom vote Republican, need this stuff as much as the people of color who do.\n\nBut it\u2019s a delicate political dance. Expanded Medicaid might be an easy target, but 7 in 10 Americans actually dig the government health care exchanges, according to Gallup\u2014so long as it\u2019s not called Obamacare. In a separate YouGov poll (pdf), 49 percent of folks say they want a repeal, but 42 percent want an ACA expansion or to leave it be, and 13 percent aren\u2019t sure.\n\nRepublicans, then, will make sure they re-engineer the law in such a way that makes it appear as if they created a new and improved health care regime. That\u2019s an eye to a future White House bid when millennial votes will come in handy, since the 18- to 34-year-old crowd prefers Grey Goose plans despite Bud Lite budgets. And Republicans have little choice\u2014or they risk facing the biggest political insurrection their party has seen since its founding. They\u2019ll say they destroyed Obamacare and finally answered the belligerent calls of the Tea Party. They\u2019ll act as if they introduced a fresh, new health care system built on state-managed \u201cgrants\u201d rather than the ill-named \u201csubsidies,\u201d protections for pre-existing conditions and insurance for your largely underemployed kids until they\u2019re 26.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.subheadline": "The GOP will verbally attack it and legislatively tweak it, but the Affordable Care Act, in some form, is staying.", "sailthru.author": "Charles D.
