(NBC News)\n\nRelated Coverage Texas sues over Obama immigration order\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 President Barack Obama met Friday with a handful of newly elected governors from across the country, including the Texas Republican who has led efforts to sue the president over his immigration executive orders.\n\nTexas Gov.-elect Greg Abbott said the lawsuit did not come up in his conversations with the president.\n\n\u201cToday was not the setting or the time to talk about legal issues,\u201d Abbott said, adding that he did raise his state\u2019s concerns about the recent influx of young people arriving at the U.S. border in his conversations with other administration officials.\n\nAbbott, who is currently Texas\u2019 attorney general, led a coalition of 16 other states this week in filing a lawsuit seeking to block Obama\u2019s immigration moves. The executive actions Obama announced last month will allow more than 4 million people in the U.S. illegally to stay in the country.\n\nObama said much of the agenda for Friday\u2019s meeting focused on the economy and ways states and the federal government can work together to promote growth.\n\n\u201cThe good news about governors is they usually don\u2019t have time to be ideological because people expect them to deliver,\u201d Obama said.\n\nAbbott has sued the Obama administration 31 times as attorney general. Most lawsuits dealt with challenging aspects of the Affordable Care Act, fighting the Environmental Protection Agency or defending laws passed by the state of Texas.\n\nNewly elected governors from Alaska, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island also took part in Friday\u2019s meeting.\n\nCopyright 2014 The Associated Press.
