(AP Photo/Khalil Hamra) The Associated Press\n\nBy FARES AKRAM, Associated Press\n\nGAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) \u2014 The father of one of four Palestinian children killed on a Gaza beach during last summer's Hamas-Israel war said Friday he was outraged by the announcement from the Israeli military that it was closing its internal inquiry into the incident without any indictments.\n\nThe father also said he hopes the killings would be part of a Palestinian war crimes case against Israel, which is expected to be presented to the International Criminal Court.\n\n\"There is no justice in the internal investigation,\" Mohammed Bakr told The Associated Press. \"We are counting on the ICC and human rights. We are not afraid and we are confident we will win because the world is with us.\"\n\nIsrael has, in the past, pointed to the credibility of its internal investigations as proof that the involvement of the ICC was unnecessary.\n\nPalestinians say the Israeli justice system is biased against them and complain the army rarely charges its soldiers with wrongdoing. The army's closure of the probe, announced in a statement late Thursday, is likely to feed those perceptions.\n\nThe four boys, all cousins aged 9 to 11, were killed while playing on a beach off a coastal road west of Gaza City during the war last summer. Seven others \u2014 adults and children \u2014 were wounded in the same airstrike. The incident drew international attention and condemnation.\n\nThursday's military statement was released late at night \u2014 something the Israeli military has done in the past when announcing the closure of similar investigations. The military said the boys' deaths were a tragic accident, caused when it mistook them for Hamas gunmen. It concluded that no international or Israeli laws of engagement were broken in the incident.\n\nMilitary spokesman Lt. Col. Peter Lerner said the announcement followed an extensive investigation by the military police, which questioned many soldiers involved in the planning and implementation of the strike.\n\nHe said on Facebook that it took place in an area \"which was utilized exclusively by militants.\" Aerial surveillance identified several figures, believed to be Hamas militants, enter a compound there.\n\n\"It should be stressed that the figures were not identified at any point during the incident, as children,\" Lerner said.\n\nWitnesses at the time said a pair of Israeli airstrikes hit the beach. The first strike hit a container on a nearby jetty and the second struck the children as they were running away from the first strike.\n\nLerner called the children's death \"tragic\" and said that steps are being taken to \"minimize the risk\" of a similar incident happening again.\n\nThe war last summer killed more than 2,200 Palestinians while 73 people died on the Israeli side.\n\nHamas fired thousands of rockets at Israeli population centers and heavily armed Gaza militants tunneled into Israel for attacks during the 50-day war. Israel used airstrikes from jets, helicopters and drones as well as thousands of artillery rounds.\n\nThe military's announcement comes as Israel braces itself for an upcoming report on last summer's war by a United Nations commission.", "article_metadata": {"zone": "world/articles", "keyword": "Associated Press", "title": "Families: No justice in Israeli inquiry on Gaza beach deaths", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) \u2014 The relatives of one of four Palestinian children killed on a Gaza beach during the war between Hamas and Israel last year are outraged that the investigation into their deaths has been closed.", "title": "Families of Gaza boys killed on beach last summer say no justice in internal Israeli inquiry", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/news/world/articles/2015/06/12/families-no-justice-in-israeli-inquiry-on-gaza-beach-deaths", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/f2/06f3c195b0e89b3f4962e8cdac2324/media:c6098ad541b24d88bc4a5f373e6b7de4MideastIsraelPalestinians.JPEG", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) \u2014 The relatives of one of four Palestinian children killed on a Gaza beach during the war between Hamas and Israel last year are outraged that the investigation into their deaths has been closed.", "site": "@USNews", "card": "summary", "title": "Families: No justice in Israeli inquiry on Gaza beach deaths"}, "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "site": "news", "date_published": "June 12, 2015", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "Collections: World,Collections: Top News,Associated Press", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) \u2014 The relatives of one of four Palestinian children killed on a Gaza beach during the war between Hamas and Israel last year are outraged that the investigation into their deaths has been closed."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9ecf\"", "article_summary": "Thursday's military statement was released late at night \u2014 something the Israeli military has done in the past when announcing the closure of similar investigations.\nHamas fired thousands of rockets at Israeli population centers and heavily armed Gaza militants tunneled into Israel for attacks during the 50-day war.\nPalestinians say the Israeli justice system is biased against them and complain the army rarely charges its soldiers with wrongdoing.\nThe father also said he hopes the killings would be part of a Palestinian war crimes case against Israel, which is expected to be presented to the International Criminal Court.\n\"It should be stressed that the figures were not identified at any point during the incident, as children,\" Lerner said."}
