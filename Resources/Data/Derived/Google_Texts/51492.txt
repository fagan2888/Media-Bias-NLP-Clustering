Nine weeks after injuring her right knee, EagleVail’s Mikaela Shiffrin demonstrated her decision to return to the World Cup was a sound one, winning a slalom Monday in Crans Montana, Switzerland. It was her first race back and her 18th World Cup win, secured despite deteriorating course conditions and poor visibility.

“It’s been a good comeback day,” said Shiffrin, 20. “That was a pretty incredible race. It’s weird, I’m kind of glad it’s over, but I enjoyed skiing that last run. It was a challenge every single gate. I kept thinking, ‘Did I miss a gate?’ I finally came to the finish re-thinking it. It was like, ‘No, I made every gate, wow, that’s amazing,’ because it was bumpy and a wild ride. A good fight, and that’s probably the way it should be.”

Shiffrin injured her knee Dec. 12, warming up for a giant slalom in Sweden. Surgery was not required and she spent eight weeks getting physical therapy in Colorado. She resumed training on snow Jan. 30, returned to Europe last week and picked up where she left off — she won the first two slalom races of the season before getting injured.

“I felt like I was training well,” Shiffrin told reporters in the finish area. “I wasn’t sure if I would be able to bring that skiing into this race. There were some scrappy turns, that’s for sure. I think that probably none of the girls skied their best and I didn’t ski my best. It was just one of those things where you have to be tough. I’m glad my mental side is there. That component is tough to get back.”

Shiffrin said she went to Europe with one primary goal: to see how many races she can win before the season ends March 20.

“I kind of have an opportunity to branch out a little bit, focus maybe more on (giant slalom) now,” Shiffrin said. “I don’t want to set my goals too high. There’s realistic but high, and there’s high and you’re just going to disappoint yourself no matter what.”
