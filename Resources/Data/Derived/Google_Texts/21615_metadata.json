Although we know the external cause for our state of anger, what exactly happens to our bodies internally?\n\nIn Life Noggin\u2019s video \u201cThe Science of Anger,\u201d host Patrick Graziosi explains how the brain processes anger and the physical effects it has on our health. In the brain\u2019s medial temporal lobe, the amygdala, which responds to outside stimuli, coordinates the release of neurotransmitters \u2014 cathecholamine \u2014 that leads to a burst of energy which prepares us for physical action. During this process, hormones epinephrine and norepinephrine are also released, increasing our blood pressure. This causes the blood to rush to our extremities like the face.\n\nBlood flow also rushes to the prefrontal cortex, the part of the brain that\u2019s over the left eye. This area controls our judgement and helps us suppress anger, so we don\u2019t act aggressively toward others. The neurological response is believed to last less than two seconds, which is why we\u2019re advised to count to 10 when we\u2019re angry.\n\nFailure to rationalize and keep anger at bay can damage heart health. The release of epinephrine and norepinephrine during these bouts of anger constricts blood vessels and forces the heart to pump faster. This can damage artery walls and even speed up the process of atherosclerosis. The fatty plaque build-up begins to narrow the arteries and increase the flow of oxygen-rich blood to the body, which can lead to a heart attack, stroke, or death.\n\nNext time someone cuts you off on the freeway, refrain from honking the horn and the not-so-nice hand gestures. Take a deep breath and count to 10 \u2014 for your heart\u2019s sake.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "all, rage, how, human, brain, keeps, anger, bay, protects, heart, health", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Taking a deep breath and counting to 10 may make a difference when it comes to anger and heart health.", "title": "This Is What Happens To Your Body When You're Angry [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/all-rage-how-human-brain-keeps-anger-bay-protects-heart-health-327910", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured_video/public/2015/04/02/all-rage-how-human-brain-keeps-anger-bay-protects-heart-health.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Taking a deep breath and counting to 10 may make a difference when it comes to anger and heart health.", "title": "This Is What Happens To Your Body When You're Angry [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/all-rage-how-human-brain-keeps-anger-bay-protects-heart-health-327910", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured_video/public/2015/04/02/all-rage-how-human-brain-keeps-anger-bay-protects-heart-health.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/04/02/all-rage-how-human-brain-keeps-anger-bay-protects-heart-health.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Under the Hood", "published_time": "2015-04-02T12:10:09-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-04-02T12:30:57-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Taking a deep breath and counting to 10 may make a difference when it comes to anger and heart health."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd942f\"", "article_summary": "Failure to rationalize and keep anger at bay can damage heart health.\nBlood flow also rushes to the prefrontal cortex, the part of the brain that\u2019s over the left eye.\nIn Life Noggin\u2019s video \u201cThe Science of Anger,\u201d host Patrick Graziosi explains how the brain processes anger and the physical effects it has on our health.\nThe release of epinephrine and norepinephrine during these bouts of anger constricts blood vessels and forces the heart to pump faster.\nAlthough we know the external cause for our state of anger, what exactly happens to our bodies internally?"}
