The new research could advance diagnostic efforts during brain cancer surgery and help drug addicts kick their habit.\n\nDrugs like cocaine come pre-loaded with the potential to cause significant internal bleeding because the heart now has a new set of demands, namely, to pump faster. This causes the body\u2019s blood pressure to rise; however, for reasons that are still largely unknown, the vessels are being told to constrict. When enough blood flow is impeded, to the point it reaches a standstill and can\u2019t reach the brain, there\u2019s a stroke.\n\nThe new technology is called optical coherence Doppler tomography, or ODT. Unlike fMRI, whose image resolutions are too low to peer inside the vessels, and two-photon microscopy, which uses a too-small field of view to track the movement of many red blood cells labeled with fluorescent dyes, ODT uses a laser light to bounce off the red blood cells. By measuring the frequency of the light wave as the cells move, they can determine its location. The phenomenon is called the Doppler Effect, and it\u2019s the same principle that explains why ambulances sound different as they travel past your ears.\n\nAccording to study researcher and associate professor in the Department of Biomedical Engineering at Stony Brook Yingtian Pan, \u201cthis is a unique technology that can do both\u201d \u2014 track a lot of cells at a high resolution, Pan said in a statement. A third benefit is that ODT doesn\u2019t rely on fluorescent dyes, which can trigger harmful side effects in human patients.\n\nWith their new technique, Pan and his colleagues gave mice a regular injection of cocaine for 30 days. They found blood flow speed dropped substantially. And, for the first time, they observed microischemia \u2014 a miniature form of the full-blown stroke, when blood flow comes to a halt.\n\nScientists can now observe blood vessels' response to cocaine, as the vessels are still healthy (left) and as they constrict (right).

When doctors want to peer into their patients\u2019 brains, they have to use invasive methods to check for blood flow. Right now the laser light can only pierce a millimeter or so beneath the surface, but with further refinement it may be able to penetrate deeper. When the brain is exposed, doctors have the luxury of checking blood flow far more easily.\n\nFor drug addicts, too, the research suggests better access to understanding the brain\u2019s physiology. Researchers can look at how blood vessels respond in the presence of certain drugs and use the information to target certain vessels and pathways over others. As for future research, the team has a few wrinkles to iron out. For one, the laser doesn\u2019t work when the vessels sit at specific angles relative to the beam, so Pan and his team are forced to fill in the missing pieces manually. Also, the laser can\u2019t measure blood flow beneath certain speeds.\n\nIn the meantime, bioengineers can use the technique to develop tissues to help brain surgeons repair tumor sites, and clinicians can stay focused on providing treatment to the roughly 23.5 million people 12 and older who receive treatment for a drug and alcohol abuse problem each year.\n\nSource: You J, Du C, Volkow N, Pan Y.
