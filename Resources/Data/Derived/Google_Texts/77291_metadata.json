Wade decision.\n\nKahrl told those stories at a rally in support of Planned Parenthood, the embattled women\u2019s health provider, which has become the focus of a coordinated attack by anti-abortion activists and their allies in Congress who want to paint the organization as a business that destroys lives, and not one that saves them.\n\nIf you listen to the opponents, you would think that fight was about a corrupt use of federal money or the illegal buying and selling of fetal tissue between abortion providers and medical researchers. But it\u2019s not.\n\nThose are manufactured scandals.\n\nThis battle is about whether a woman should have access to a safe, legal abortion. What the opponents don\u2019t say is that they attack Planned Parenthood to bring the country back to the days when it was a crime for a woman to decide not to go through with an unplanned pregnancy, and anyone who broke that law took her life in her hands.\n\nRep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, doesn\u2019t remember those days. The chairman of the House Oversight Committee, who badgered Planned Parenthood director Cecile Richards in Washington on Tuesday while the rally was going on in Portland, was 6 years old when the Supreme Court ruled in Roe v. Wade. This is all he\u2019s ever known.\n\nSen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, wouldn\u2019t remember those days either. At 44, he was only a year old when abortion became legal. Now he is hoping that his plan to shut down the U.S. government to leverage an end to government funding for medical services (not including abortion) at Planned Parenthood clinics will land him in the White House.\n\nAnd certainly the 26-year-old filmmaker David Daleiden, whose undercover videos are the pretext for the latest assault on the organization was not around then. He edited the films to create the debunked notion that there is an alliance between medical researchers and Planned Parenthood clinics to increase the number of abortions for profit.\n\nHere\u2019s what they missed from the days before Roe:\n\n\u2022 Just because abortion was illegal didn\u2019t mean that women didn\u2019t need them.\n\nIllegal abortions were common, with estimates range from 200,000 to 1.2 million per year, according to the Guttmacher Institute, an independent nonprofit policy research institute affiliated with Planned Parenthood.\n\n\u2022 They were also dangerous. Abortion was listed as the cause of death for hundreds of women every year, even into the 1970s. The majority of women who seek abortions already have children, so many deaths left a devastated family. Now a fatal abortion complication is a rarity.\n\n\u2022 Poor women were especially affected. They could not afford to travel to a state where abortion was legal or fly to Europe, so they were more likely to seek out illegal abortions. According to one study of low-income women in New York City in the 1960s, nearly one in 10 said they had sought an illegal abortion.\n\nCruz and the others act as if ending legal abortion would end abortion.\n\nWomen like Julia Kahrl know that\u2019s not what would happen.\n\n\u201cWomen will find another way,\u201d she said. \u201cThe abortion rate of women in countries where it is legal and countries where it is not are the same.\u201d\n\nPlanned Parenthood is the focus of this attack not just because it provides health services including abortion, but because it advocates for women who want to be the ultimate decision maker over questions of their own fertility.\n\nThe organization raises a lot of money and it spends it on political campaigns, supporting candidates who share its point of view, who these days tend to be Democrats. This makes Planned Parenthood a target for Republicans who want the organization on the sidelines as we approach an election year.\n\nThat\u2019s how politics works these days, but it\u2019s important to hear from grandmothers that this is not just another political issue. Kahrl said she heard from women on Tuesday who are afraid of going back to those dark days before abortion was legal. She was glad to see that it wasn\u2019t just the older people who understand the risk.\n\n\u201cIt was really nice to see so many young women out there today\u201d she said. \u201cThey know what\u2019s at stake.\u201d\n\nGreg Kesich is the editorial page editor at the Portland Press Herald.
