He\u2019s so efficient. He doesn\u2019t have any wasted motion. So far, he floats over it.\u201d\n\nSherman said he entered California Chrome in Hollywood Derby to help boost his chances for Horse of the Year and to \u201cgive me a lot of options\u201d for California Chrome\u2019s 4-year-old campaign in 2015.\n\nCalifornia Chrome will be the seventh Kentucky Derby champion to race at Del Mar after winning the nation\u2019s most famous race and first since Giacomo, the 2005 winner.\n\nCalifornia Chrome\u2019s bid for the Triple Crown ended with a dead heat for fourth in the Belmont Stakes on June 7 when he was stepped on by the horse next to him at the start, tearing some tissue in his right front heel.\n\nCalifornia Chrome returned to racing Sept. 20, finishing sixth in the Pennsylvania Derby. He was third in the Breeders\u2019 Cup Classic Nov. 1.\n\n\u201cI wish I had gone into the Breeders\u2019 Cup like we\u2019re coming into this race,\u201d Sherman said.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t get the race I wanted him to have in Pennsylvania, he was too covered up, it wasn\u2019t the race he really needed. With another workout, there\u2019s no doubt he would have won the Breeders\u2019 Cup.\u201d\n\n\u2014 City News Service\n\n>> Subscribe to Times of San Diego\u2019s free daily email newsletter!
