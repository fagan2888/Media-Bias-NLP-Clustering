Whole articles now offer strategies on how to handle this character when the family sits down around the table. (And this has truly been a banner year for crazy uncles\u2014several of whom seem to be dominating the presidential race.)\n\nBut wait: What\u2019s so bad about crazy uncles? Who said the holidays need to be as boring as a George Pataki rally?\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nWe\u2019re guessing that if you\u2019re reading this\u2014if you\u2019re reading Politico over the Thanksgiving holiday\u2014you\u2019re not so worried about the crazy uncle problem. In fact, you might even enjoy getting into the game a little yourself.\n\nYes, it\u2019s time to be the crazy uncle for a change. Obviously not every crazy uncle is created equal. The best kind of crazy depends who you\u2019re sitting next to. The key thing is to identify your target, plop down in the right seat and make someone else\u2019s Thanksgiving one for the books.\n\nHere\u2019s Politico\u2019s play-by-play guide to making your Thanksgiving inflammatory, memorable and just plain yuuuuge.\n\n***\n\nTarget: Your niece who goes to Brown\n\nOpening move: Show up precisely, militarily on time, carrying a generous gift of wild game. Preferably just shot. Preferably by you. (Power move: Rent a pick-up truck and park it on the lawn, or on anything growing.)\n\nCocktail hour: Drink American beer, straight from the can. Inquire, innocently: \u201cSo \u2026 anyone here still believe in evolution?\u201d Use the ensuing silence to demand loudly that dinner be served with \u201cextra gluten.\u201d\n\nDinner: It\u2019s showtime. Happily chime out \u201ctrigger warning!\u201d whenever a dish containing meat passes your niece. When someone responds in shock, joke that you thought this was a \u201csafe space.\u201d When someone responds in shock to that, mutter something about microaggressions. If the campaign comes up, refer to male candidates by surnames, but talk about \u201cHillary\u201d and \u201cCarly.\u201d Parry the inevitable complaints about holiday radio or excessive commercialism by complaining loudly about the \u201cWar on Christmas.\u201d Deliberately confuse lines from the Bible with articles in the Constitution. If terrorism hasn\u2019t come up by pumpkin pie time, just observe how at least Bush kept us safe.\n\nOptional power move: On the way out, suggest a book for her book club. Hand her God, Guns, Grits and Gravy by Mike Huckabee, littered with post-it notes.\n\n***\n\nTarget: Your Tea Partier cousin\n\nPregame: Keep everyone waiting at least an hour. Be clear it was because you needed to let the fruit fly trapped in your Prius escape on its own timeframe.\n\nCocktail hour: Wave off any commercial beverage. Serve your own wine, fermented from grapes that fell to the ground. Wait until someone is drinking a name-brand soda to bring up the many studies connecting it to cancer.\n\nDinnertime: In lieu of grace, ask everyone around the table if instead they\u2019d all take a moment to confront their white privilege. Ask your cousin to go first. (Especially strong move if your cousin is the only white person at the table.) As the turkey is brought forth, mention your gratitude for our government\u2019s thoughtful regulation of the poultry industry. Mention that without Native Americans, Middle Easterners and Europe, there would be no such thing as cranberry sauce. For no reason, mention the Federal Reserve fondly. Find a way to bring up politics, then refer dismissively to voters \u201ccrazy enough\u201d to support Ted Cruz. Within 90 seconds, also announce you\u2019re embarrassed to be an American because its people are so intolerant of other\u2019s viewpoints.\n\nAfter dinner: Wait until a crucial moment of the football game, then rise from your chair, turn off the television, and lecture the surprised children present that if 9/11 taught us anything, it\u2019s that \u201cviolence is not the answer.\u201d\n\nPower play: Insist on a moment of silence for \u201cGod\u2019s servant, Jimmy Carter.\u201d\n\n***\n\nTarget: Family friend who works for the New York Times\n\nUpon arrival: Cross the doorstep already delivering a long, preferably pointless anecdote from the Rush Limbaugh repeat you were listening to in the car. Under your arm, carry a manila folder filled with wrinkled papers, which you wave at the friend and whisper mysteriously, \u201cFor later.\u201d\n\nCocktail hour: Any sentence you utter that does not include the phrase \u201clamestream media\u201d or \u201cI read online someplace\u201d is a sentence wasted. Turn the conversation quickly to cover-ups. The topic is irrelevant: The real goals of Obamacare, the climate change lie, the Kennedy assassination, or any \u201cuntold\u201d story that the Times has already covered more than the Yankees.\n\nDinner: Bide your time, arching your eyebrows knowingly at all the \u201cfacts\u201d being bandied about. If you must say something, offer some quiet praise for Ben Carson for exposing the lie about the Egyptian pyramids. When everyone\u2019s attention is finally elsewhere, pull out your manila folder and hand it over with one word: \u201cBenghazi.\u201d When the reporter changes the topic, fakes grave injury and/or bolts for the door, shake your head sadly and say, \u201cWe always knew.\u201d\n\nPostgame option: If at any point a newscast comes on television, utter loudly, \u201cThat\u2019s just what they want you to believe.\u201d\n\n***\n\nTarget: Your investment banker son-in-law\n\nArrival: Forget the Prius. That\u2019s for posers. You\u2019re late because you had to walk 2 miles from the nearest bus stop. (Uber is a corporate scam.) You shrug off your cardigan to reveal a \u201cFeel the Bern\u201d sticker on your T-shirt. Pretend not to notice that you\u2019re the only one wearing a T-shirt to Thanksgiving. Do not smile.\n\nCocktail hour: The watchword here is \u201crigged.\u201d Anyone drinking Bacardi rum? Well, that\u2019s a company that ripped off the Cuban people and rigged the game for the imperialists. Did someone mention Cuba? Oh, right, you did. Exhaustively praise the Cuban health care system.\n\nDinnertime: If the turkey\u2019s a Butterball, offer a long litany of the company\u2019s crimes against the people. Look to your son-in-law and whisper: \u201cTell them.\u201d Casually insert references to \u201cthe 1 Percenters\u201d into unrelated discussions about the vegetable dishes, especially if they include slivered almonds, or are served with a special fork. Refuse to eat all the food on your plate. Ask for a bag so you can give the rest to \u201cthe people who really deserve it.\u201d Forget to leave with the bag.\n\nAfter dinner: Wait, did the kids really just start playing a game\u2026 and it\u2019s Monopoly? Yes! After denouncing the children as \u201ccorporate shills,\u201d and explaining \u201cshills,\u201d advise them they might as well just hand all their money to your son-in-law now, because that\u2019s where it\u2019s going to end up anyway.\n\n***\n\nTarget: Your brother-in-law, the loyal Jeb! donor\n\nArrival: Emerge from a black stretch limousine with gold trim, undercarriage lights, license plate reading: NUMBER 1.\n\nCocktail hour: Bring your own wine, from your private vineyard\u2014the greatest vineyard in the world. It puts Napa to shame, OK? Offer some to your Bush-loving brother-in-law, who is a teetotaler, and also the host. When he says no, pour the wine into his glass anyway. Say: \u201cMaybe this\u2019ll give you some energy.\u201d Refer to him constantly by an emasculating nickname (Mr. Snooze, Four Percent, Hot Pants). Get the kids onboard with this early.\n\nDinner: Your over-the-top opinion is required on everything. The cranberry sauce is not good; it\u2019s \u201cfantastic.\u201d The stuffing isn\u2019t just bad; it\u2019s \u201ca total disaster.\u201d Spice up your anecdotes with absurd claims. The White House was named after Betty White. You were the inspiration for the Terminator. If nobody takes the bait, quickly ratchet them up: Many leading rabbis have privately told you that Moses was a \u201creally big Christian.\u201d When anyone objects, deny you just said that, then repeat it as fact as soon as your brother-in-law tries to speak again.\n\nAfter dinner: Turn the largest available TV to the football game and spend all your time alternately praising Tom Brady (who is not playing) and blasting every other player as a \u201cno-talent loser.\u201d Elbow the kids away from the Monopoly table to show them \u201chow the game is really played.\u201d Start with the Teamsters (you) skimming 10 percent of all rent on the hotels or else \u201cthere\u2019s going to be some really ugly accidents.\u201d Hand the 13-year-old banker a $50 under the table. When he notices it\u2019s real, tell him, \u201cThere\u2019s more where that came from, OK?\u201d Regardless of actual results, declare victory.\n\n\n\nMatt Latimer is a former speechwriter for President George W.
