His alleged drug abuse has caused a media whirlwind surrounding his marriage. And, the Kardashian media machine has remained uncharacteristically quiet as Odom\u2019s addiction has gained more and more publicity.\n\nTMZ reported earlier Thursday that the couple has been estranged since the rumors began and that Kardashian was unaware that Odom would be entering a treatment facility.\n\nIt is alleged that Odom is addicted to crack cocaine. His drug abuse dates all the way back to the 1999 NBA draft, when rumors of his addiction bumped him down from the number one pick to the number four pick in the draft. In 2001, Odom was suspended for five games for violating the NBA\u2019s anti-drug policy. Last week, Odom was arrest for driving under the influence, and, most recently, drug abuse counselors from the National Basketball Players Association offered to help him overcome his addiction.\n\n\"I just couldn't control myself in L.A. ... the lifestyle that I was living and the things I had access to,\" Odom said in 2003 when asked about his drug violation.\n\nKhloe Kardashian has not shied away from social media amid rumors of her fledgling marriage.
