(AP) - Though the NCAA Tournament is something of a spring ritual for Kansas and Villanova, their recent visits have been cut short.\n\nSo Saturday night\u2019s Elite Eight appearance might have a new feel to it for both schools.\n\nKansas, the tournament\u2019s No. 1 overall seed, is making its first Elite Eight appearance since 2012, when the Jayhawks reached the NCAA championship game before losing to Kentucky. Second-seeded Villanova hasn\u2019t played in a regional final since 2009, when the Wildcats reached the Final Four.\n\nAs different as this extended stay might feel, both teams believe they are here because of experience and lessons learned from previous disappointments. They have been so impressive in the tournament, this showdown seemed almost inevitable.\n\nVillanova coach Jay Wright even compared it to a heavyweight fight on Friday.\n\n\u201cBoth of us are playing our best basketball right now, and both of us have played pretty well during the season,\u201d Wright said. \u201cIt\u2019s one-seed, two-seed and teams that I think feel very good about how they\u2019re playing. So I would say that\u2019s a heavyweight matchup.\u201d\n\nThe Wildcats (32-5) have won three tournament games by an average of 24 points, including Thursday night\u2019s 23-point drubbing of No. 3 Miami in the Sweet 16. Villanova is shooting nearly 60 percent from the field in the tournament.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re on fire right now,\u201d said Kansas coach Bill Self, who quickly noted that his Jayhawks (33-4) have been just as dominant.\n\nKansas needed a first-half rally against No. 5 Maryland before routing the Terps 79-63. Their performance didn\u2019t surprise Self, who has often seen his team\u2019s experience pay off this season.\n\nAsked if it Saturday\u2019s matchup feels any different, Jayhawks forward Landen Lucas said, \u201cIt does, but we\u2019ve experienced so many pressure moments in games and situations like this this season. We know what it\u2019s like to come out and compete at a high level, and we\u2019ll get that done.\u201d\n\n___\n\nSome other things to watch in Saturday\u2019s South Region final:\n\nBETTER DEFENSE: Villanova needed to shoot well against Miami because it allowed the Hurricanes to make 53 percent from the field in the victory. Kansas might not shoot as many 3-pointers as Miami, but the Wildcats know the Jayhawks are just as capable of lighting up the scoreboard. \u201cWe\u2019re aware of how well we\u2019re playing offensively,\u201d Villanova senior center Daniel Ochefu said, \u201cbut defensively, we have a lot of room to get better. We have to make ourselves accountable, and that\u2019s how we\u2019ll get better in games.\u201d\n\nCOOL HAND LUCAS: Kansas junior forward Landen Lucas is averaging a double-double through three NCAA games, 12 points and 10.3 rebounds. He had season highs of 14 points and 11 rebounds against Maryland, reinforcing his growing status as the Jayhawks\u2019 glue guy. \u201cThat\u2019s a credit to my team,\u201d he said. \u201cThey give me the ball in good position. The way I score is off of those guys.\u201d\n\nJENKINS\u2019 STRETCH RUN: Villanova junior forward Kris Jenkins has been rolling during the postseason, averaging 17.8 points in the Big East Conference and NCAA Tournaments. \u201cI always believe the next one\u2019s going in,\u201d said Jenkins, who made 5 of 6 from long range and finished with 21 points and nine rebounds against Miami. \u201cI always keep that mentality.\u201d\n\nStory Continues \u2192", "article_metadata": {"description": "Though the NCAA Tournament is something of a spring ritual for Kansas and Villanova, their recent visits have been cut short.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Though the NCAA Tournament is something of a spring ritual for Kansas and Villanova, their recent visits have been cut short.", "title": "Top-seeded Kansas, No. 2 Villanova set for Elite 8 showdown", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/mar/25/top-seeded-kansas-no-2-villanova-set-for-elite-8-s/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2016/03/24/ncaa_maryland_kansas_basketball.jpeg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2016/03/24/ncaa_maryland_kansas_basketball.jpeg", "description": "Though the NCAA Tournament is something of a spring ritual for Kansas and Villanova, their recent visits have been cut short.", "card": "summary", "title": "Top-seeded Kansas, No. 2 Villanova set for Elite 8 showdown"}, "Author": "GARY B.
