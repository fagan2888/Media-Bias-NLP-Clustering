At a time when the U.S. could have asserted leverage, he said, the U.S. offered a lifeline.\n\n\u201cPro-democracy and human rights activists have lamented that human rights weren\u2019t part of these secret negotiations,\u201d Royce said. \u201cWe have no indication that the Cuban government intends to give ground.\u201d\n\nBut Roberta Jacobson, assistant secretary for the State Department\u2019s Bureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs, said Obama\u2019s executive action was not a concession or a gift.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a channel of communications,\u201d she said. \u201cWe believe that we can more effectively pursue the human rights policies and empower the Cuban people by having a direct channel with the Cuban government to address those concerns.\u201d\n\nThe Obama administration issued regulations earlier this month that allow travelers who qualify under a dozen broad categories of authorized travel to visit the country without applying for a license.\n\nThose categories include visiting family, conducting business, journalism, government meetings, research, education, religious purposes, public performances, athletic competitions and humanitarian projects. But Americans are still not allowed to travel to Cuba for tourism.\n\nThe policy change will also ease banking and export restrictions.\n\nBut Rep. Albio Sires (D-N.J.) said he doesn\u2019t see how the president\u2019s actions will help the Cuban people.\n\n\u201cI just don\u2019t see where we\u2019re headed with this,\u201d he said. \u201cI know it\u2019s the last two years of the presidency. I know he has a history to build, but I was disappointed that we\u2019re not using this as a pressure point on a government that\u2019s been so brutal.\u201d\n\nThough Rep. Jeff Duncan (R-S.C.) said Obama was within his rights to ease relations with Cuba, he said the Cuba government has to give certain concessions before the U.S. lifts it trade embargo.\n\nThe onus, he said, is now on the Cuban government to create free fair elections and a free press, release political prisoners and end the harassments of political activists.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Republicans said the historic policy shift is a bad deal for the U.S.", "description": "Republicans said the historic policy shift is a bad deal for the U.S.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Lydia Wheeler", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "Republicans said the historic policy shift is a bad deal for the U.S.", "title": "Lawmakers slam Obama's 'secret' Cuba talks", "url": "http://thehill.com/regulation/231706-obama-kept-congress-in-the-dark-on-cuba-says-house-committee", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T03:59:59-05:00", "type": "article"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T03:59-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/regulation/231706-obama-kept-congress-in-the-dark-on-cuba-says-house-committee", "dcterms.date": "2015-02-04T11:27-05:00", "dcterms.creator": "Lydia Wheeler", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Cuba, Presidency of Barack Obama, Socialism, Opposition to Fidel Castro, Politics,,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-02-04T11:27:40-05:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T03:59:59-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/regulation/231706-obama-kept-congress-in-the-dark-on-cuba-says-house-committee", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "Republicans said the historic policy shift is a bad deal for the U.S.", "card": "summary", "title": "Lawmakers slam Obama's 'secret' Cuba talks"}, "dcterms.title": "Lawmakers slam Obama's 'secret' Cuba talks"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe47a6\"", "article_summary": "\u201cPro-democracy and human rights activists have lamented that human rights weren\u2019t part of these secret negotiations,\u201d Royce said.\nBut Americans are still not allowed to travel to Cuba for tourism.\nHad Obama consulted his staff, Royce said, he would have learned that Havana is at risk of losing its Venezuelan oil subsidies.\nBut Rep.
