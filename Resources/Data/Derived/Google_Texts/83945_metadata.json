You can't just stick it out there and hope that they grab it,\" he said.\n\nThe cyclists are zooming by nearly 20 miles per hour.\n\nMauney said, \"Most of the time as fast as they are moving if they go to grab the bottle of water or the piece of food, then they just end up slapping it out of your hand.\"\n\nSaturday afternoon, Panama City Beach Police Officers were at the corner of 79 and Back Beach Road making sure the cyclists crossing were safe.\n\nBack on the course, organizers say getting enough volunteers to help hand out water, power drinks and fruit gets easier every year.\n\nRace Volunteer, John Mcavoy said, \"They are begging to sign up. They enjoy coming out here it's no effort at all to get volunteers to get out here and support this event.\"\n\nVolunteers say each charities make about $500 from this event.\n\nOfficials say the last runner will likely cross the finish line around midnight.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "video", "description": "Keeping Nearly 3,000 triathletes safe during Ironman Florida took planning and a lot of volunteers.", "language": "english", "author": "Morgan Kyrklund", "og": {"description": "Keeping Nearly 3,000 triathletes safe during Ironman Florida took planning and a lot of volunteers.", "title": "Volunteers Keeping Ironman Triathletes Safe", "url": "http://www.wjhg.com/home/headlines/Volunteers-Keeping-Ironman-Triathletes-Safe-230363201.html", "image": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/804/FBE/804FBE8B2AEB4D80869A8AD1D99A5BFA", "video": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/A4F/D45/A4FD451094024F978C7BE538791861AF.mp4", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.wjhg.com", "description": "Keeping Nearly 3,000 triathletes safe during Ironman Florida took planning and a lot of volunteers.", "title": "Volunteers Keeping Ironman Triathletes Safe", "url": "http://www.wjhg.com/home/headlines/Volunteers-Keeping-Ironman-Triathletes-Safe-230363201.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/43AE9D87D36C46A1A9EF0E10512D074F.jpg", "creator": "@WJHG_TV", "site": "@WJHG_TV", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "video_type": "video/mp4", "video_height": 288, "keywords": "Volunteers Keeping Ironman Triathletes Safe", "google-site-verification": "orfdzs_E4bRXom1qluA34zerrmjsg4QfrlLSkrR3ZAQ", "video_width": 512, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Volunteers Keeping Ironman Triathletes Safe"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdea91\"", "article_summary": "Water was vital to keeping the nearly 3,000 Ironman Florida triathletes going.\nNearly 3,000 triathletes took to the beach, highways and pavement for the 15th annual Ironman Florida.\nKeeping all the athletes safe during the all day event took planning and a lot of volunteers.\nVolunteers say each charities make about $500 from this event.\nBack on the course, organizers say getting enough volunteers to help hand out water, power drinks and fruit gets easier every year."}
