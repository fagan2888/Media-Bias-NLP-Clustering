Paul Ryan says. J. Scott Applewhite/AP\n\nRep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., is chatting with all types of media over the next few weeks as he rolls along on a national tour to promote his new book, \"The Way Forward.\"\n\nBut he's steering completely clear from commentary on the crisis in Ferguson, Missouri, giving local law enforcement and President Barack Obama the benefit of the doubt and saying that trying to prescribe a policy solution at this moment would be \"disrespectful.\"\n\n[READ: Five of the Best Tidbits From Paul Ryan's New Book]\n\nU.S. News spoke to Ryan by phone Wednesday as he rode from New York to Philadelphia. Here's a lightly edited transcript of our conversation.\n\nQ: Given your efforts to engage with minority communities, do you think some of the anger in Ferguson is warranted, given the lack of minority representation in local government and positions of authority?\n\n\n\nRyan: I really worry about hooking or grafting my policy initiatives on to this tragedy because I think that would be too opportunistic and disrespectful to do that. I think it\u2019s important to say that because I think a lot of politicians will say, \u201cLook at this tragedy, therefore do my recommendation,\u201d and I just think it\u2019s kind of disrespectful to do that.\n\nSo if you\u2019re asking me a question about systemic poverty in poor communities and what\u2019s happening, let me go there.\n\nQ: So you don\u2019t think systemic poverty is at all linked to what we\u2019re seeing unfold there?\n\n\n\n\n\nRyan: No, I just don\u2019t want to give the impression that I\u2019ve got all the answers and I\u2019m going to use this tragedy to promote my ideas. I, just out of respect for the Brown family and the community, don\u2019t want to do that.\n\nBut I do believe that one of the problems that I have learned from listening to people combating poverty is it's a form of isolation.\n\nPeople in poor communities have been isolated from the rest of society. And society has isolated them. In many ways, one of the inadvertent casualties of the war on poverty is we\u2019ve given this mistaken impression that this is the government\u2019s responsibility and only the government\u2019s responsibility, when in fact it\u2019s all of our responsibilities.\n\nWe need to reintegrate the poor into our communities. We need to stop isolating the poor.\n\nQ: I know you\u2019ve said you weren\u2019t going to second-guess law enforcement in Ferguson, but what about the president\u2019s role? Do you think he\u2019s had the appropriate response so far to the crisis?\n\nRyan: I think at this time he needs to be a moral leader, I think at this time he needs to be a healer of communities and I think at this time he needs to be a unifier. I haven\u2019t watched everything he's said so I really can\u2019t comment whether he\u2019s meeting that or not. I watched one press conference, I thought he did pretty well. Don\u2019t ask me to comment on whether he\u2019s right or wrong because I don\u2019t know the full scope of what he\u2019s done.\n\n[QUIZ: How Well Do You Know Paul Ryan?]\n\nBut I do believe this is a moment for leaders to try and bring healing to our communities and to this situation and we also need to take a breath and let the facts be found, let law enforcement do their job and their investigation so that the facts can come to light and justice can be done\n\nQ: But part of the problem is a lack of trust there between African-Americans and law enforcement, over even who should try the case.\n\nRyan: I\u2019m not going to nitpick that stuff. I\u2019m just not qualified to say who should do what. I do believe that what we\u2019re seeing is the need for all communities to be more integrated, in that, we want people communicating with each other. I think we need to see law enforcement work to pre-empt problems in the future by establishing better community relations. Honestly, I think these things go without saying, but I\u2019m not going to get into the specific details of what should or should not be done by the players in this community. I\u2019m a Wisconsin representative and I don\u2019t know the people in Ferguson or the attorney general or the [district attorney] or the police chief.\n\nQ: Do you think it was the right decision for Eric Holder to get involved?\n\nRyan: There\u2019s a federal component to all of this and I\u2019m not going to second-guess that, either. I just want to be respectful of the process.\n\nQ: Would you support legislation being introduced in the House to rein in the Defense Department program that provides militarized equipment to local police forces?\n\nRyan: I\u2019d have to look at it more closely before forming an opinion. I know that in my neck of the woods, we\u2019ve gotten surplus Coast Guard boats for search and rescue in Lake Michigan. That doesn\u2019t seem inappropriate to me, so on some of these issues, you want to be careful painting with a broad brush so that you don\u2019t have unintended consequences. I\u2019d want to look at the legislation before forming any opinion on it. Q: You write a lot about domestic policy in your book, but don't touch foreign policy. Given the success we\u2019ve had in Iraq with airstrikes against the Islamic State group, do you think the president should consider strikes in Syria as well?\n\n\n\n\n\nRyan: I think he should consider it. I also think he should consider arming the rebels in Syria. He missed an opportunity to do it early in the crisis when it was much easier to distinguish the good guys and the bad guys in Syria. I think he made a number of missteps there, which helped contribute to the rise of [the Islamic State group].\n\n[ALSO: Paul Ryan Releases New Anti-Poverty Plan]\n\nBut I do believe this is a threat to our national security \u2013 this terrorist organization, which is transnational, meaning it's both in Syria and Iraq. But I also think if you\u2019re going to get yourself involved in Syria in the air, you need to also supply aid to the indigenous Syrians who want a free country.\n\nQ: So closer to the Hillary Clinton position on that. Ryan: I wouldn't use those words. Q: What do you make of the increasingly popular notion among Republicans that they\u2019ll need a governor from outside of Washington in order to beat Hillary Clinton? Ryan: I\u2019ll worry about 2016 in 2015. Q: So you don't think that's unfair, to limit it to governors? Ryan: I'll worry about 2016 in 2015. Q: On the Ryan road map, I know you've written about the tension with the National Republican Congressional Committee about campaigning on this and giving people the opportunity of private Social Security accounts. I'm wondering if you think it's possible to run a national campaign on that issue. Ryan: That's not privatizing it, by the way. Privatizing is, \"Here's the money, go find a stockbroker, good luck.\" Letting young people have access to the thrift saving account system \u2013 which is what all federal workers have \u2013 to get a better rate of return on their money on a voluntary basis, I think, is a good idea. I've always thought it was a good idea and I'm perfectly comfortable supporting that as I have been for many, many years. Q: [Is that] possible to do in a national campaign? Ryan: Absolutely.", "article_metadata": {"zone": "homepage/articles", "keyword": "The Run 2016 [News]", "title": "Paul Ryan Won't Second-Guess Amid Ferguson Crisis", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "The former vice presidential nominee says trying to apply a policy solution would be disrespectful.", "title": "Ryan Won't Second-Guess Amid Ferguson Crisis", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/news/blogs/run-2016/2014/08/20/paul-ryan-wont-second-guess-amid-ferguson-crisis", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/3d/99/8cf8c9af47e0962e96921fa6a1d2/140820-ryan-editorial.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The former vice presidential nominee says trying to apply a policy solution would be disrespectful.", "site": "@USNews", "card": "summary", "title": "Paul Ryan Won't Second-Guess Amid Ferguson Crisis"}, "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "site": "news", "date_published": "Aug. 20, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "David Catanese,2016 presidential election,Ryan, Paul,Pulse,picks,social security,Missouri,Holder, Eric,Obama, Barack,poverty,Ferguson, Missouri,The Run 2016 [News]", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "The former vice presidential nominee says trying to apply a policy solution would be disrespectful."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2208\"", "article_summary": "Q: So you don\u2019t think systemic poverty is at all linked to what we\u2019re seeing unfold there?\nDo you think he\u2019s had the appropriate response so far to the crisis?\n\"Hooking or grafting my policy initiatives on to this crisis\" would be too opportunistic, Rep.
