Their choices will shape global health and the environment for the next century and beyond.\n\nSince the first humans trekked north from sub-Saharan Africa more than 70,000 years ago, globalization has influenced public health. People, goods and services, money, and ideas traveled around the world, carrying prevalent diseases with them. What\u2019s different today is the magnitude and speed of these global interchanges of health and illness. Money that once took months to move is now wired around the world in milliseconds. Diseases that once took weeks or years to cross national borders can now spread globally in hours or days. HIV became a global pandemic within a few years after spreading slowly for a few decades in Africa. Avian flu and H1N1 spread around the world within a few weeks.\n\nWhat is also different is the growing power of multinational corporations to make the decisions that shape global trade. Companies that used to produce for local or national markets now send their products around the world, creating the potential for global outbreaks of acute illnesses or chronic diseases. Baby formula produced in China in 2008 was contaminated with melamine, a byproduct of plastic manufacturing illicitly added to formula to mimic high-protein additives. As a result, infants in dozens of nations suffered from kidney problems, and some died. Aggressive and sophisticated marketing of tobacco, alcohol and unhealthy food, once confined to advanced industrial nations, has now spread around the world, contributing to premature deaths and preventable illnesses in Africa, Asia, and Latin America as well as in North America and Europe.\n\nThe corporate consumption complex and its ideology, born in the United States and Europe, has become a global force. If an alternative political or economic agenda is to lead to improvements in world health, it, too, must operate globally. The success of the tobacco control movement in curtailing tobacco use in advanced industrial nations but not in developing and emerging markets provides a grim reminder of the peril of ignoring the global dimensions of lethal but legal products and practices. As tobacco use grows in Africa, Asia, and Latin America, tobacco mortality is predicted to increase tenfold compared to the last century. Already, hyperconsumption has established a beachhead in the growing middle classes of emerging nations. Allowing these trends to continue will accelerate the global rise in chronic diseases and injuries and the growing health gap between the better-off and the poor.\n\nExporting Obesity and Diabetes: NAFTA and the Health of Mexico\n\nConstructing an alternative to hyperconsumption and its disease burden will require an understanding of the strategies that multinational corporations use to distribute their unhealthy products around the world. To begin this task, let us examine the impact of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) on the health of the people of Mexico, a story that illustrates how free trade can harm health. The United States, Mexico, and Canada signed NAFTA in 1994 to create the world\u2019s largest trading bloc.\n\nIn the late 1980s, these three nations began to negotiate a new treaty designed to eliminate barriers to trade and investment. The political battle to pass NAFTA pitted industries in these countries that were big enough to prosper from expanded markets\u2014tobacco, processed food, and automobiles\u2014against smaller ones that preferred the continued protections that tariffs and subsidies offered. NAFTA opponents included industries like textiles, apparel, rubber, and plastics, as well as labor unions and environmental groups, who feared that the agreement would hurt their interests. The industries that had saturated the domestic U.S. market with unhealthy products and were now attracting greater regulatory scrutiny favored NAFTA and its successor treaties as a way to reach new customers in markets with less stringent public health and environmental standards. In testimony at a Senate hearing on the Central America\u2013Dominican Republic Free Trade Agreement, a NAFTA spinoff treaty approved in 2005, Kraft\u2019s executive vice-president for global corporate affairs, Mark Berlind, explained:\n\nThe 50 U.S. states are currently Kraft\u2019s largest market. Given U.S. demographic realities, however, future growth for Kraft\u2014as well as for the entire U.S. food and agriculture complex\u2014is inextricably tied to our ability to access export markets. Mr. Chairman, as you and most other farm state Members know, 95 percent of the world\u2019s consumers live outside the U.S. That is where future growth will take place.\n\nFor the U.S. food and agricultural sectors, the quest for new international markets was the consequence of the subsidy, trade, and land policies that Secretary of Agriculture and former Ralston Purina director Earl Butz had implemented during the Nixon Administration, as described in Chapter 3. These policies, approved at the behest of the agribusiness interests Butz represented, had led to overproduction of cheap, processed food and the need for new customers to sustain profits.\n\nPresident Bill Clinton, who became a champion of NAFTA when he took office in 1993, responded to critics by saying that he supported the treaty because it would create jobs in the United States:\n\nNAFTA will generate these jobs by fostering an export boom to Mexico; by tearing down tariff walls\u2026.Already Mexican consumers buy more per capita from the United States than other consumers in other nations. . . . The average Mexican citizen . . . is now spending $450 per year per person to buy American goods. That is more than the average Japanese, the average German, or the average Canadian buys. . . . So when people say that this trade agreement is just about how to move jobs to Mexico so nobody can make a living, how do they explain the fact that Mexicans keep buying more products made in America every year? Go out and tell the American people that\u2026.And there will be more if they have more money to spend. That is what expanding trade is all about.\n\nAlthough the United States had long had trade agreements with other countries, NAFTA was the first proposed agreement among countries of such unequal size and levels of development in which governments chose to ignore these differences. It was also the largest trade agreement to be negotiated since the emergence of the Washington Consensus, the U.S.-driven push to elevate free trade, deregulation, and privatization to paramount political and economic priorities. For these reasons, NAFTA was important both in its own right and for setting precedents that guided the creation of the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 1995 and subsequent bilateral and multilateral trade agreements.\n\nThe NAFTA treaty called for a variety of changes, some to be implemented immediately, and others to be phased in over fifteen years. These included reductions in tariffs between the three countries, increased protection for corporate intellectual property rights, and the relaxation of restrictions on for- eign direct investment. On the whole, it opened wide the doors that enabled U.S.-based corporations to export many products, including those that harmed health.\n\nIn the years after NAFTA, the pattern of food exchanges between Mexico and the United States changed significantly, as did the diet of Mexicans. American exports of sugar, high-fructose corn syrup, snack food, dairy products, and breakfast cereals to Mexico increased dramatically. In 1994, the United States exported about 50,000 metric tons of sugar and other sweeteners to Mexico; by 2007, this had climbed to almost 950,000 metric tons, a nineteen-fold increase. U.S. exports of corn and soybeans, the foundation of industrial processed food for both American and Mexican producers, also increased significantly. In this same period, exports of livestock and other meat products more than tripled. In the decade after NAFTA passed, sales of processed food in Mexico increased by 5 to 10 percent annually.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The global age of hyperconsumption is here, and with it come preventable injuries, illness and even premature death", "title": "How corporate America exports disease to the rest of the world", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The global age of hyperconsumption is here, and with it come preventable injuries, illness and even premature death", "title": "How corporate America exports disease to the rest of the world", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/03/02/how_corporate_america_exports_disease_to_the_rest_of_the_world/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/03/mcdonalds_china.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The global age of hyperconsumption is here, and with it come preventable injuries, illness and even premature death", "title": "How corporate America exports disease to the rest of the world", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/03/mcdonalds_china.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Nicholas Freudenberg", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Books, Corporate America, Disease, Globalization, Lethal But Legal, public health", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9377\"", "article_summary": "If an alternative political or economic agenda is to lead to improvements in world health, it, too, must operate globally.\nWhat is also different is the growing power of multinational corporations to make the decisions that shape global trade.\nTheir choices will shape global health and the environment for the next century and beyond.\nAmerican exports of sugar, high-fructose corn syrup, snack food, dairy products, and breakfast cereals to Mexico increased dramatically.\nThe corporate consumption complex and its ideology, born in the United States and Europe, has become a global force."}
