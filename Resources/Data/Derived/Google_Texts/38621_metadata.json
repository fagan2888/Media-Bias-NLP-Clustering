On Wednesday night in the Pepsi Coliseum at the Indiana State Fairgrounds, Knight formally endorsed Trump.\n\n\u201cYou folks are taking a look at the most prepared man in history to step in as president of the United States,\u201d Knight said. \u201cThere has never been a presidential candidate prepared to the length that this man is.\u201d\n\nAccording to Knight, the U.S. military will get the utmost respect and support under the Trump administration. He said the military will also be the strongest in the world.\n\n\u201cTo have his endorsement is an honor,\u201d Trump said.\n\nNational security\n\nTrump\u2019s speech backed Knight\u2019s endorsement. He plans to defeat ISIS in the early months of him taking office.\n\nSecuring the borders and building relations with foreign countries is what Trump said is important. He said he wants people to come into America, but wants to ensure they do so legally.\n\nTrump said there is a large trade imbalance with Mexico of over $58 billion. Because of this, he said they owe us the wall.\n\n\u201cWe are going to have strong, powerful borders,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe are going to build the wall\u2014believe me.\u201d\n\nCruz/Fiorina ticket\n\nJust hours before Trump\u2019s rally Wednesday, GOP presidential hopeful, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, announced businesswoman and former Republican presidential candidate Carly Fiorina as his running mate.\n\nSome rally attendees were surprised by the early announcement, since candidates usually wait until they\u2019re the nominee before announcing a vice presidential candidate. The announcement led those at the rally to speculate who could share the ticket with Trump. Evan Kennedy of West Lafayette would love to see Marco Rubio or Chris Christie as Trump\u2019s potential nominee.\n\n\u201cI think he needs to get someone who is politically minded because we have the business minded leader in Trump,\u201d said Kennedy.\n\nTrump argued Cruz should not be choosing a vice president because he has no path to victory.\n\n\u201cHe is the first presidential candidate in history who is mathematically eliminated and is choosing a vice president,\u201d Trump said.\n\nSunday night Ohio Gov. John Kasich and Cruz announced they would be working together in an effort to stop Trump from receiving the 1,237 delegates needed to win on the first ballot at the Republican National Convention. Kasich suspended his campaign in Indiana in an attempt to clear the way for a Cruz win here. In return, Cruz suspended his campaigns in New Mexico and Oregon to try to clear the way for Kasich victories there.\n\nTrump called Kasich and Cruz colluders and stragglers, since neither one of them mathematically have a chance to win.\n\n\u201cIt is an act of desperation,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIt shows weakness. Neither one of them have a path to victory.\u201d\n\nSaving jobs\n\nTrump surprised the crowd with a visit from his son Don Trump Jr. Don Jr., as he\u2019s called, said his father is a businessman and because of this, he knows how to create jobs and make deals.\n\nThe economy and job market has been an important topic amongst presidential candidates, with a special focus at times on the air conditioning company, Carrier.\n\n\u201cI am going to bring jobs back to our country. We are not going to let Carrier leave,\u201d Trump said.\n\nIn February, United Technologies and Carrier announced they would be moving some production from Indianapolis to Mexico. The move is expected to eliminate at least 1,400 Hoosier jobs.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re going to stay and we are going to have our jobs,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI want the jobs. I don\u2019t back down. I\u2019m working for you.\u201d\n\nAmong the issues of foreign affairs and jobs, Trump also wants to cut Common Core, repeal and replace Obamacare, and protect the second amendment.\n\nTrump said he does everything for the best interest of the country.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m thinking of America first,\u201d Trump said.\n\nTrump will host another rally Thursday at the Old National Events Plaza in Evansville.\n\n\u201cIf we win, we are going to make this country great again\u2014greater than ever before,\u201d Trump said.\n\nAdrianna Pitrelli is a reporter for TheStatehouseFile.com, a news website powered by Franklin College journalism students.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.4.2"}, "article_summary": "\u201cHe is the first presidential candidate in history who is mathematically eliminated and is choosing a vice president,\u201d Trump said.\nBy Adrianna PitrelliTheStatehouseFile.comINDIANAPOLIS \u2014 The crowd of nearly 5,000 went wild as former Indiana University men\u2019s basketball coach Bobby Knight took the stage alongside GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump.\nKnight called Trump a year ago, telling him he should run for president.\nI\u2019m working for you.\u201dAmong the issues of foreign affairs and jobs, Trump also wants to cut Common Core, repeal and replace Obamacare, and protect the second amendment.\n\u201cThey\u2019re going to stay and we are going to have our jobs,\u201d Trump said."}
