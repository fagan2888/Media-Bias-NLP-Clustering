On Sunday's episode of Wall Street Week, hosts Anthony Scaramucci and Gary Kaminsky asked multibillionaire hedge fund manager Carl Icahn about his thoughts on the president.

His answer may not have been what viewers expected.

"I know this will surprise you because I was really against Obama, but I think some of the things he does [are] OK," Icahn said.

"So now I'm on the opposite side again, because everybody in the Hamptons hates his guts."

Back in 2008, when much of Wall Street was getting behind Obama and about a fifth of his funding came from the Street, Icahn was a staunch opponent.

He reportedly said Obama would make a "terrible" president.

Now his tone has changed.

"Look, I wouldn't want to see him president again, but I don't think he's terrible," he said.
