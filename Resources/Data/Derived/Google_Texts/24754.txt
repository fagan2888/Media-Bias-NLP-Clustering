Mercy Health officials say the company will lay off 300 to 350 employees in four states next week.

The company, based in Chesterfield, said in a news release Wednesday the layoffs will occur in four states but it did not specify which states. The health care company has hospitals in Missouri, Kansas, Oklahoma and Arkansas, as well as outreach ministries in Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas.

Mercy Health said most of the layoffs will be from leadership employees.

The statement claimed Mercy is facing challenges caused by the Affordable Care Act and the lack of Medicaid expansion in Missouri. It said the layoffs are needed to simplify the company's organization, make it more efficient and reduce costs.
