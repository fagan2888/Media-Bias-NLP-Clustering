The company doesn\u2019t sell policies in the state\u2019s individual market this year.\n\nThe department turned down the request by ConnectiCare Benefits Inc. to raise rates by an average of 12.8 percent, but approved a rate hike averaging 3.1 percent.\n\nAnd regulators will allow HealthyCT to lower its rates by 8.5 percent, slightly less than the company initially proposed.\n\nThe decisions follow actuarial reviews of the insurers\u2019 proposals that included assumptions about how much health care costs will rise, the medical needs of members and the financial impact of federal protections for insurers included in the health law commonly known as Obamacare.\n\nThe rate proposals cover individual-market health plans that the companies intend to sell through Access Health CT, the state's health insurance exchange. The proposals by Anthem and HealthyCT also applied to plans purchased outside the exchange.\n\nAnthem\u2019s proposal\n\nArielle Levin Becker / The CT Mirror\n\nThe proposal by Anthem, the state\u2019s largest insurer, drew the most public scrutiny. The department held a public hearing on the proposals last month after state Healthcare Advocate Victoria Veltri requested it.\n\nMany customers submitted comments questioning the need for a rate hike. Anthem officials attributed the proposed hike to rising pharmaceutical costs, increased use of medical services, reduced federal risk protection for insurers and federal fees that cover the cost of subsidizing people\u2019s premiums as part of Obamacare.\n\nIn reviewing the proposals, Actuary Paul Lombardo suggested that Anthem should reduce or remove several factors it used in calculating premiums in 2014, including the estimate of how much the cost of covering medical services will rise.\n\nLombardo also determined that the federal government will likely provide more aid to insurers that face large medical claims than Anthem assumed, providing it with more money than anticipated.\n\nLombardo suggested that Insurance Commissioner Thomas B. Leonardi order Anthem to recalculate its rates using new assumptions that he suggested.\n\nAnthem spokesman Scott Golden said the company is will review the ruling before deciding on its next steps.\n\n\u201cWe respect the Connecticut Department of Insurance decision, and remain committed to being thoughtful and transparent regarding our proposed rate increases,\u201d he said.\n\nIn a statement, Veltri and Attorney General George Jepsen -- whose office participated in the hearing on Veltri\u2019s behalf -- said the hearing process and ability to cross-examine Anthem\u2019s witnesses had \u201ccontributed significantly\u201d to the department\u2019s decision.\n\n\u201cWe believe that full transparency contributes substantially to the department\u2019s review in these matters, and we will continue to pursue public hearings when necessary to ensure a full vetting of carriers\u2019 proposed rates,\u201d they said.\n\nAnthem\u2019s individual-market plans cover approximately 66,200 policies, according to the department.\n\nConnectiCare\u2019s proposal\n\nConnectiCare Benefits initially proposed raising rates by an average of 12.8 percent, but later lowered the proposed increase to 6.2 percent.\n\nBut Lombardo determined that the company\u2019s assumption about how much medical claims costs would rise was too high, and revised it to a lower rate. As it did in Anthem\u2019s case, the department also determined that carriers will have more financial protection from large medical claims, and required the company to apply that assumption to lower the rate increase.\n\nThe department is allowing the company to raise its rates by an average of 3.1 percent for 2015.\n\nCurrently, the company has 27,500 policies. ConnectiCare Benefits sells plans on the state\u2019s health insurance exchange, but is a separate company from ConnectiCare, which sells plans outside the exchange.\n\nHealthyCT\u2019s proposal\n\nHealthyCT, a new carrier in 2014, has among the highest rates of plans sold through the state\u2019s exchange. It proposed lowering its rates, explaining in its filing to the department that it no longer needed to account for pent-up health care needs of new members who had been uninsured in the past.\n\nBut Lombardo determined that the carrier needs to account for some pent-up demand in its 2015 rates. He suggested the carrier factor in the need to cover some higher-than-usual use of medical services.\n\nOverall, the company received approval to lower its rates by an average of 8.5 percent -- slightly less than the company initially proposed.\n\nThe filing indicated that the plans currently cover 7,248 policyholders.", "article_metadata": {"standout": "http://ctmirror.org/2014/07/29/insurance-department-rejects-anthem-rate-hike-lowers-other-proposals/", "news_keywords": "Health Care, 2015 exchange plan designs, Affordable Care Act, Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield, connecticare, Connecticut Insurance Department, healthyct, Obamacare, Paul Lombardo", "original-source": "http://ctmirror.org/2014/07/29/insurance-department-rejects-anthem-rate-hike-lowers-other-proposals/", "og": {"site_name": "The CT Mirror", "description": "The Connecticut Insurance Department rejected Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield\u2019s request to raise individual-market premiums by an average of 12.5 percent next year, deeming the proposal excessive and directing the carrier to submit new rate proposals for review.", "title": "Insurance department rejects Anthem rate hike, lowers others", "url": "http://ctmirror.org/2014/07/29/insurance-department-rejects-anthem-rate-hike-lowers-other-proposals/", "image": "http://ctmirror.org/files/2014/06/Paul-Lombardo-Anthem-hearing-e1403885189104-1170x873.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@ctmirror", "card": "summary", "creator": "@ariellelb"}, "syndication-source": "http://ctmirror.org/2014/07/29/insurance-department-rejects-anthem-rate-hike-lowers-other-proposals/", "fb": {"admins": "10103384569292809,7920421,10205310995067193", "app_id": 439136839547306}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd010\"", "article_summary": "The rate proposals cover individual-market health plans that the companies intend to sell through Access Health CT, the state's health insurance exchange.\nThe Connecticut Insurance Department has rejected proposals by two insurance companies to raise health insurance premiums next year, and rejected the rates proposed by a third company new to the individual market.\n\u201cWe respect the Connecticut Department of Insurance decision, and remain committed to being thoughtful and transparent regarding our proposed rate increases,\u201d he said.\nConnectiCare Benefits sells plans on the state\u2019s health insurance exchange, but is a separate company from ConnectiCare, which sells plans outside the exchange.\nThe department turned down the request by ConnectiCare Benefits Inc. to raise rates by an average of 12.8 percent, but approved a rate hike averaging 3.1 percent."}
