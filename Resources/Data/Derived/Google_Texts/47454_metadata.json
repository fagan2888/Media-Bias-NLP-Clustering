He said they\u2019ve consulted with staff and elected officials and conducted two public meetings with residents of the western communities about the transit center\u2019s future.\n\nBased on the feedback, Gregg recommended CAT officials consider starting a van pool program along with three new bus routes that could provide service to west Chatham.\n\nPooler would be a good candidate for the van pool program, he said, because of the number of major employers in the area who could have a shared interest.\n\nIt\u2019s also an alternative to the buses that many citizens who attended the public meetings so adamantly opposed.\n\n\u201cThis is a feasibility study, but I think it gives you a good sense of alternatives and costs,\u201d Gregg said. \u201cWe looked at the entire mobility approach. ... You could be operating a number of van pools, which would be really appropriate for this suburban environment. Our recommendation would be to develop that program because there\u2019s benefits all around.\u201d\n\nFor Garden City, much of the proposal was for new bus routes.\n\nOf the three routes Gregg offered as positive sources of revenue for CAT, two would begin at Garden City\u2019s Towne Center.\n\nThe suggested \u201cblue route\u201d would begin at City Hall and would run from Dean Forest Road to U.S. 80 and end up at the intermodal center downtown.\n\nThe \u201cgreen route\u201d would be a loop that begins at Garden City City Hall, runs south on Dean Forest Road to Ogeechee Road, then north on Chatham Parkway back to U.S. 80 in Garden City where it ultimately would end up again on Dean Forest Road at Garden City City Hall.\n\nThe third proposed route would be the \u201cbrown route\u201d from the Wal-Mart store on Ogeechee Road north to Quacco Road. From there it would follow Pooler Parkway to Pooler\u2019s new Tanger Outlet Center.\n\nBased on the researchers\u2019 models, Gregg said, the \u201cgreen route\u201d loop would be a highly successful route that could likely garner as much revenue as the transit system\u2019s Abercorn Express route.\n\nCAT CEO Chad Reese said the transit system plans to bring the proposal to stakeholders in western Chatham before any other steps are taken to begin an expansion.\n\nBased on the feedback the researchers received from officials in the area, they would have their work cut out for them.\n\nOfficials in Pooler were highly concerned about taxation and whether the service is even needed, Gregg said. In Garden City, there was more of a vagueness about the need, he added.\n\nAfter these officials have weighed in, the CAT board will consider adopting a plan and incorporating it into CAT\u2019s larger strategic plan.\n\nAt that point, Reese said, they would take a recommendation to the Chatham County Commission for a vote.\n\n\u201cThis is an action plan,\u201d he said after the meeting. \u201cIf we get the go-ahead (from the county commission), we\u2019ll do it full steam ahead.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nIn other business Tuesday:\n\nThe board:\n\n\u2022 Adopted the budget and millage rate for fiscal year 2016. The board held its second reading of the budget for the next fiscal year, which is expected to climb by $1.5 million over this fiscal year to $21 million. The budget assumes a 1 percent increase to property tax digest, though finance director Terri Harrison reported the increase will likely be higher.\n\n\u2022 Held a first public hearing on an adjusted fare policy. The rate changes would take place this October, marketing director Shalonda Rountree reported, and is aimed at moving riders away from paying with cash.\n\nThe proposed change would increase fares for paratransit and one-way trips and decrease rates for multi-day passes, student and youth passes and those for seniors, the disabled and medicare recipients.\n\nIt also would discontinue change cards and half-fare 20-ride passes. More hearings for the adjusted fare policy have been scheduled for next month.\n\n\u2022 Approved an insurance renewal with Blue Cross Blue Shield that reflects a 4.5 percent increase related to requirements of the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u2022 Passed a resolution in support of the 10th annual Dump the Pump Day on June 18.", "article_metadata": {"geo.position": "32.083541;-81.099834", "news_keywords": "savannah, georgia, news press, hilton head, south carolina, newspaper, historic district, classifieds, savannah morning news, news, entertainment, local businesses, shopping, midnight, mci heritage, st. patricks day, city guide, savannah area resources", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "rights": "Copyright Savannah Morning News, Morris Publishing Group", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "/profiles/msms/themes/published/device-icons/widetile.png", "twitter": {"url": "http://savannahnow.com/news/2015-05-19/chatham-area-transit-hears-proposal-expand-system-westward", "title": "Chatham Area Transit hears proposal to expand system westward", "description": "The future of transit in Chatham County\u2019s western suburbs should involve more than buses, a transportation researcher from the University of South", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": {"identifier": "@savannahnow", "id": 9164672}}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "/profiles/msms/themes/published/device-icons/smalltile.png", "robots": "value", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "/profiles/msms/themes/published/device-icons/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "savannahnow.com", "title": "Chatham Area Transit hears proposal to expand system westward", "url": "http://savannahnow.com/news/2015-05-19/chatham-area-transit-hears-proposal-expand-system-westward", "image": "http://savannahnow.com/sites/default/files/14029879_0_1.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-05-20T06:48:52-04:00", "type": "article"}, "MobileOptimized": "width", "__sync_contentCategory": "metered", "keywords": "savannah, georgia, news press, hilton head, south carolina, newspaper, historic district, classifieds, savannah morning news, news, entertainment, local businesses, shopping, midnight, mci heritage, st. patricks day, city guide, savannah area resources", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "/profiles/msms/themes/published/device-icons/mediumtile.png", "fb": {"app_id": 1575785529334435}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe160c\"", "article_summary": "Our recommendation would be to develop that program because there\u2019s benefits all around.\u201dFor Garden City, much of the proposal was for new bus routes.\nCAT CEO Chad Reese said the transit system plans to bring the proposal to stakeholders in western Chatham before any other steps are taken to begin an expansion.\nIn Garden City, there was more of a vagueness about the need, he added.\nThe future of transit in Chatham County\u2019s western suburbs should involve more than buses, a transportation researcher from the University of South Florida said Tuesday.\nThe third proposed route would be the \u201cbrown route\u201d from the Wal-Mart store on Ogeechee Road north to Quacco Road."}
