2016 contenders react to Obamacare ruling From Hillary Clinton (she's happy) to Jeb Bush (he's not), candidates take to Twitter after the Supreme Court ruling.

Here’s how the 2016 presidential contenders reacted on Twitter to the Supreme Court’s decision to uphold a major component of the Obamacare health law:

Deeply disappointed by #SCOTUS ruling. Fundamental increase of govt control. I'm working to ensure next Pres repeals and replaces #Obamacare Story Continued Below — Dr. Ben Carson (@RealBenCarson) June 25, 2015

We must #Repeal and replace #Obamacare with sensible consumer empowering solutions that remove govt from the patient/doctor relationship. — Dr. Ben Carson (@RealBenCarson) June 25, 2015

Those of us who pledge to repeal #Obamacare must redouble our efforts and not waste time and energy mourning today's #SCOTUS ruling. — Dr. Ben Carson (@RealBenCarson) June 25, 2015

I am disappointed in the Burwell decision, but this is not the end of the fight against ObamaCare. http://t.co/3yaEVF1TaW — Jeb Bush (@JebBush) June 25, 2015

Yes! SCOTUS affirms what we know is true in our hearts & under the law: Health insurance should be affordable & available to all. -H — Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) June 25, 2015

A great day! Add your name if you agree: Affordable health care is a basic human right → http://t.co/5xR3n1XDoc pic.twitter.com/kATncnkfGq — Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) June 25, 2015

It is outrageous that the Supreme Court once again rewrote ObamaCare to save this deeply flawed law https://t.co/NBAnohFTW7 — Carly Fiorina (@CarlyFiorina) June 25, 2015

ObamaCare has not lived up to what we were promised. It has become clear that this law isn’t working http://t.co/qaAR7pNVQJ — Carly Fiorina (@CarlyFiorina) June 25, 2015

Repeal Obamacare and let the free market—not more crony capitalism—improve access and care for all Americans. http://t.co/qaAR7pNVQJ — Carly Fiorina (@CarlyFiorina) June 25, 2015

Today’s decision reinforces why we need a pres who will bring real reform that repeals & replaces Obamacare MORE: http://t.co/QriBHw6zDt — Lindsey Graham (@LindseyGrahamSC) June 25, 2015

SCOTUS ruling on ACA means more insured healthy Americans! I'm proud that RI had one of the nation's best rollouts. #chafee2016 — Lincoln Chafee (@LincolnChafee) June 25, 2015

There isn't a 'do-over’ provision in our Constitution that allows unelected, SCOTUS judges power to circumvent Congress & rewrite bad laws. — Ted Cruz (@tedcruz) June 25, 2015 I remain fully committed to the repeal of Obamacare—every single word of it. And, in 2017, we will do exactly that https://t.co/6i4WzLFzKR — Gov. Mike Huckabee (@GovMikeHuckabee) June 25, 2015

#SCOTUS can't legislate from the bench & pass trillion dollar 'fix' to ObamaCare because Congress misread the states. http://t.co/IsTiI6Lqbz — Gov. Mike Huckabee (@GovMikeHuckabee) June 25, 2015

#ObamaCare ruling is judicial tyranny. http://t.co/Di6WjxOc3y — Gov. Mike Huckabee (@GovMikeHuckabee) June 25, 2015

#SCOTUS has NO authority to rescue Congress from creating bad law. #Burwell ruling is an out-of-control act of judicial tyranny. #ObamaCare — Gov. Mike Huckabee (@GovMikeHuckabee) June 25, 2015

The solution is for Congress to admit they screwed up, repeal the "nightmare of #Obamacare" & let states road-test real health care reforms. — Gov. Mike Huckabee (@GovMikeHuckabee) June 25, 2015

The King v. #Burwell decision, which protects and expands #ObamaCare, is an out-of-control act of judicial tyranny. http://t.co/5tCeTwyvdo — Gov. Mike Huckabee (@GovMikeHuckabee) June 25, 2015

President Obama and Hillary Clinton would like this to be the end of the debate on Obamacare, but it isn’t: http://t.co/XpY9HtxFQO — Gov. Bobby Jindal (@BobbyJindal) June 25, 2015

Now that this ideological attempt to stop #ACA failed, we must redouble our efforts to bring health care to every person in this nation. — Martin O'Malley (@MartinOMalley) June 25, 2015

The Affordable Care Act has helped more than 17 million Americans access quality and affordable health coverage. #ACAworks #KingvBurwell — Martin O'Malley (@MartinOMalley) June 25, 2015

This decision turns both the rule of law and common sense on its head. #KingvBurwell — Dr. Rand Paul (@RandPaul) June 25, 2015

As President I would make it my mission to repeal #Obamacare, and propose real solutions for our healthcare system. http://t.co/9KHFqbBWwS — Dr. Rand Paul (@RandPaul) June 25, 2015

Justice Scalia got it right! "Words no longer have meaning if an Exchange that is not established by a State is "established by the State." — Dr. Rand Paul (@RandPaul) June 25, 2015

Americans deserve better than what we’re getting with Obamacare. It’s time we repealed and replaced it! http://t.co/1EHfbVKBMa — Rick Perry (@GovernorPerry) June 25, 2015

I disagree with the Court’s ruling and believe they have once again erred in trying to correct the mistakes made by President Obama... — Marco Rubio (@marcorubio) June 25, 2015

...and Congress in forcing ObamaCare on the American people. — Marco Rubio (@marcorubio) June 25, 2015

Despite the Court’s decision, ObamaCare is still a bad law that is having a negative impact on our country and on millions of Americans. — Marco Rubio (@marcorubio) June 25, 2015

I remain committed to repealing this bad law and replacing it... — Marco Rubio (@marcorubio) June 25, 2015

...with my consumer-centered plan that puts patients and families back in control of their health care decisions. — Marco Rubio (@marcorubio) June 25, 2015

We need Consumer Care, not ObamaCare. — Marco Rubio (@marcorubio) June 25, 2015

The Supreme Court recognized the common-sense reading of the ACA. Access to affordable health care shouldn't depend on where you live. — Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) June 25, 2015

Today's Supreme Court ruling is another reminder that if we want to get rid of #Obamacare, we must elect a conservative President #RICK2016 — Rick Santorum (@RickSantorum) June 25, 2015

Today's #SCOTUScare ruling means Republicans must redouble their efforts to repeal and replace this destructive & costly law. -SKW — Scott Walker (@ScottWalker) June 25, 2015

Workers have lost hours, people have lost insurance & can no longer afford dramatic premium hikes. #SCOTUScare -SKW pic.twitter.com/dFnI8uSNDe — Scott Walker (@ScottWalker) June 25, 2015
