It was supposed to be a tool that translated nutritional recommendations into the kinds and amounts of food that we need to eat each day.\n\nEvery year, scientific research reveals new discoveries about health, and what that triangle poster represented has morphed over the years.\n\nThe USDA recently published new Dietary Guidelines outlining the latest information. This huge document, representing thousands of hours of interdisciplinary research and collaboration, is primarily targeted toward health professionals and policy makers. However, the implications for the everyday American are huge.\n\nDietary Guidelines impact what the food industry produces, what\u2019s found on grocery store shelves and what public schools serve kids for lunch. This document also outlines the fact that Americans need to get moving more.\n\nAccording to the new information, almost half of Americans (117 million people) are coping with chronic diseases, many of which are preventable with eating properly and moving more.\n\nPhysical activity plays a crucial role for staying healthy and, according to the latest findings, Americans are just not cutting it in this category. The guidelines indicate that adults should engage in 150 minutes of moderate intensity exercise per week. For additional health benefits, we should do muscle-strengthening exercises at least two times per week. Two and a half hours may seem like a chunk out of your week to spend at a gym, but remember, physical activity doesn\u2019t only mean lifting weights or walking on a treadmill at a gym. Getting moving also includes yard work, a pick-up game of basketball, painting a room in your house or walking at the mall.\n\nThe secret to sustainable exercise is finding activities that are productive, enjoyable or both.\n\nTwo key changes in the dietary guidelines\n\nIn the realm of nutrition, two key changes were made that will ultimately impact government programs such as school lunch, and also products placed on supermarket shelves.\n\nA limit on added sugar \u2014 \u201cConsume less than 10 percent of calories per day from added sugars.\u201d\n\nTo put this significant change into perspective, an average diet of 2,000 calories a day would mean only 200 calories could come from added sugar, including syrups or other caloric sweeteners. Those 200 calories equal approximately 12 teaspoons of sugar a day. A 20-ounch bottle of Mountain Dew (or insert your favorite soda here) has almost 20 teaspoons, more than your daily recommended amount.\n\nBuy Photo Eggs (Photo: Michael Zamora/Register file photo)\n\nDietary cholesterol \u2014 \u201cNo longer a nutrient of concern for overconsumption\u201d\n\nTo translate: Eggs aren\u2019t evil and you may enjoy one (or three) at breakfast each morning. Science now tells us that there is no significant correlation between dietary cholesterol leading to increased blood cholesterol levels.\n\nFor most of us, the Dietary Guidelines document won\u2019t be on our reading list this year, but the key information it contains is something we should all pay attention to. We have the power to avert or reverse some chronic diseases with proper self-care, nutritious foods and physical activity. Simply moving your body in enjoyable ways and making small changes in your diet are two, very positive steps toward health and longevity. It\u2019s time to get moving.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://dmreg.co/1V2aZ6A", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Remember the old USDA food pyramid \u2013 the triangle graphic with different food groups pictured?
