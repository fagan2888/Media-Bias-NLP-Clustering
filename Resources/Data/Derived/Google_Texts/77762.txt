OKLAHOMA CITY — Experts say many of Oklahoma’s rural hospitals are struggling financially, with several of the facilities putting the blame on a requirement to convert to an electronic medical records system.

Hospital consultant Val Schott told The Oklahoman that a high number of the state’s rural hospitals are struggling to pay their expenses. He estimates that a dozen or so have less than 10 days’ cash on hand to pay operational expenses.

Schott said the loss of a local hospital hurts the economy, because it’s often one of the community’s largest employers. He added that a lot of companies don’t want to move their business to a community if nearby hospital care isn’t available.

Complying with the federal requirement that hospitals convert to an electronic medical records system has been hard for several rural hospitals. Roger Knak, CEO of Fairview Regional Medical Center in Major County, said the facility was down to four days’ cash on hand to pay expenses around a year ago, which he largely blamed on the records system requirement.

Knak said a 2 percent reduction in reimbursement for treatment of Medicare patients also has hurt the hospital’s finances.

He said hospitals were told they could expect an increase in the percentage of insured patients because of the Affordable Care Act to offset other increased costs. But he said Major County still has 21 percent of its residents uninsured.

“I’ve been struggling for almost three years to replace a physician who left us,” he said. “We are facing an extreme difficulty getting physicians to choose to practice in a rural part of the state. The cost of recruiting goes up and the difficulty in maintaining physicians goes up.”

Hospital officials indicate that requests for more financial help are likely, both in the form of Congressional action to improve reimbursement rates and requests for financial assistance from local governmental entities.
