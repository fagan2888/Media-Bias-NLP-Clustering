And while that decision generated a lot of commentary, there\u2019s one band who took a different approach to addressing the Supreme Court ruling. Ladies and gentlemen, we present Coheed and Cambria.\n\nThe veteran rockers known for creating elaborate concept discs showed their lighter side by teaming up with Funny or Die to record a new song. But the subject matter is not their usual fare. The band noticed that Justice Antonin Scalia was one of the dissenting opinions on the same sex marriage ruling, and it\u2019s not the first time he\u2019s been on the wrong side of history. So, they decided to record a song coming from his wording in not only the same sex marriage ruling, but also on the Affordable Care Act.\n\nWatch as singer Claudio Sanchez offers a tender, melodic approach to lyrics like, \u201cThe Court\u2019s interpretation renders words inoperative / Goes beyond giving words bizarre meanings / Words no longer have meaning.\u201d And watch as the band picks things up, letting an egg shaker up the tempo as Sanchez belts, \u201cUnderstatement, thy name is an opinion on the Affordable Care Act!\u201d\n\nCoheed and Cambria are between albums at the moment, but things have been good in the band. Last fall, guitarist Travis Stever told us, \u201cI would say we\u2019re as closest as we\u2019ve ever been, personally, within the band. And a lot can be said for Zach [Cooper] being a part of it, to help fuel that. Because he\u2019s just such an accepting, and a really personable, and just like, positive influence on all of us. So that\u2019s Zach. And then you have Josh [Eppard], Claudio, and I, well we have this huge history since the beginning. And I don\u2019t like to over examine things, but, something\u2019s happened where the three of us are closer than ever, along with Zach, and that\u2019s what I\u2019m saying. You don\u2019t like to question things, you don\u2019t like to over analyze, but I, flat out, we just went on a tour, and we\u2019ve enjoyed it more than ever, so, I don\u2019t really always get to say that.\u201d\n\nHe added that the band is always working and that after taking some time for themselves last fall, they would be back working on new music soon.\n\nTravis Stever Talks Revisiting 'In Keeping Secrets' Disc", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "http://loudwire.com/files/2015/06/Coheed-and-Cambria.jpg", "sailthru.author": "chadchilders", "description": "Coheed and Cambria rock a song made up of wording from Justice Scalia's dissenting decisions.", "og": {"site_name": "Loudwire", "description": "Coheed and Cambria rock a song made up of wording from Justice Scalia's dissenting decisions.", "title": "Coheed and Cambria Rock Justice Scalia's Decisions", "url": "http://loudwire.com/coheed-and-cambria-song-about-justice-scalia-dissenting-decisions/", "image": "http://loudwire.com/files/2015/06/Coheed-and-Cambria.jpg?w=600&h=0&zc=1&s=0&a=t&q=89", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"site": "@Loudwire", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-06-29 08:06:59", "sailthru.title": "Coheed and Cambria Rock Song About Justice Scalia\u2019s Dissenting Decisions", "sailthru.tags": "tsmsite-loudwire, tsmmarket-national, tsmtype-national, coheed-and-cambria, funny, news, rock, videos", "fb": {"admins": 8802808, "app_id": 222651877772174}, "keywords": "coheed and cambria rock song of justice scalia's dissenting decisions", "sailthru.description": "Coheed and Cambria rock a song made up of wording from Justice Scalia's dissenting decisions.", "sailthru.image.full": "http://loudwire.com/files/2015/06/Coheed-and-Cambria.jpg", "viewport": "width=1020"}, "article_summary": "So, they decided to record a song coming from his wording in not only the same sex marriage ruling, but also on the Affordable Care Act.\nLast week, there was a major decision on same sex marriage made by the Supreme Court that now makes it legal for same sex couples to wed in all 50 states.\nThe band noticed that Justice Antonin Scalia was one of the dissenting opinions on the same sex marriage ruling, and it\u2019s not the first time he\u2019s been on the wrong side of history.\nAnd while that decision generated a lot of commentary, there\u2019s one band who took a different approach to addressing the Supreme Court ruling.\nLadies and gentlemen, we present Coheed and Cambria."}
