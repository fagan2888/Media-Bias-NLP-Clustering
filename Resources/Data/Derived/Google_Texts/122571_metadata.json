It works with a foot pedal flush. Just press, and the waste goes away.\n\nWith each \u201cflush,\u201d the Dungaroo spreads antimicrobial pellets over the waste, rendering it odorless and killing germs without using water or harsh chemicals.\n\nThe waste is sealed in a bag.\n\n\u201cIt all goes into a larger plastic bag with a drawstring, so that's all you're touching,\u201d Morris said. \u201cYou\u2019d just tie it up and throw it away.\u201d\n\nMorris is marketing it to the RV and boat industry, and she hope the Dungaroo will eventually replace traditional porta-potties.\n\nIn developing countries such as Haiti, where sanitation is a public health crisis, the Dungaroo could save lives, Morris said.\n\nWhile Morris is trying to get the Dungaroo to market, she\u2019s keeping her sense of humor in a business that seems to bring out the 5-year-old in everyone.\n\n\u201cMy nephew calls me a 'poopologist.\u2019 I go with it,\u201d she said with a laugh.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30;polling-uri=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wral.com/rss/48&id=1;polling-uri2=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wral.com/rss/48&id=2;polling-uri3=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wral.com/rss/48&id=3;polling-uri4=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wral.com/rss/48&id=4;polling-uri5=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wral.com/rss/48&id=5;cycle=1", "dcterms.created": "2014-04-07 13:47:00", "description": "Liz Morris, a graduate student at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, has developed a portable toilet that doesn't require water.", "application-name": "WRAL.com", "dcterms.modified": "2014-04-07 18:39:18", "outbrain": {"ob_desc": "id_asset=13547511|asset_type=story"}, "twitter": {"description": "Liz Morris, a graduate student at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, has developed a portable toilet that doesn't require water.", "title": "Doodling UNC student invents waterless porta-potty :: WRAL.com", "url": "http://www.wral.com/doodling-unc-student-invents-waterless-porta-potty/13547511/", "image": "http://wwwcache.wral.com/asset/news/local/2014/04/07/13548387/13548389-1396910266-160x120.jpg", "site": "@wral", "card": "summary"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#041E30", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "/favicons/mstile-70x70.png", "robots": "index,follow", "pinterest": "nohover", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "/favicons/mstile-310x310.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "/favicons/mstile-310x150.png", "fb": {"app_id": 334167666672300}, "author": "WRAL", "article": {"published_time": "2014-04-07T13:47:00-04:00"}, "msapplication-square150x150logo": "/favicons/mstile-150x150.png", "og": {"site_name": "WRAL.com", "description": "Liz Morris, a graduate student at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, has developed a portable toilet that doesn't require water.", "title": "Doodling UNC student invents waterless porta-potty :: WRAL.com", "url": "http://www.wral.com/doodling-unc-student-invents-waterless-porta-potty/13547511/", "image": "http://wwwcache.wral.com/asset/news/local/2014/04/07/13548387/portapottie_copy-542x523.jpg", "type": "article"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "msapplication-TileImage": "/favicons/mstile-144x144.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe27af\"", "article_summary": "Just press, and the waste goes away.\nMorris formed a venture called Sanitation Creations to market the Dungaroo.\nIn developing countries such as Haiti, where sanitation is a public health crisis, the Dungaroo could save lives, Morris said.\nYou must enter the characters with black color that stand out from the other charactersMessage: * A friend wanted you to see this item from WRAL.com: http://wral.com/13547511More on this Sanitation Creations UNC student's waterless porta-potty could help developing countries Find News Near Me\u2014 Porta-potties can be pretty gross.\nLiz Morris, a graduate student at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, has developed a portable toilet that doesn\u2019t require water."}
