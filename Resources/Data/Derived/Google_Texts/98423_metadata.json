She\u2019s inevitable, but she can\u2019t win an election. And even when she wins a debate, she still lost it.\n\nThis might seem like an indication of what we already know \u2014 that the former secretary of state is an extremely polarizing candidate, whose very name is treated as a curse word or a reason to break out the Holy Water during the Republican presidential debates. The New York Times\u2019 Mark Leibovitch wrote earlier this year that \u201cdivisive\u201d has become almost associated with her very name: \u201cClinton has worn the polarizing badge more than any other politician since the word came into its unfortunate vogue.\u201d But as Leibovitch argued, Hillary\u2019s status as a divider is less a product of her politics than our own.\n\nLeibovitch compared the phenomenon to \u201cBush derangement syndrome,\u201d a term coined by Charles Krauthammer to describe \u201cthe acute onset of paranoia in otherwise normal people in reaction to the policies, the presidency \u2014 nay \u2014t he very existence of George W. Bush.\u201d But while the adverse reaction to Bush often bordered on hysteria, Krauthammer\u2019s phrase comes from 2003 \u2014 when America was becoming deeply entrenched in a costly war that it became clear was founded on a myth. If Saddam Hussein was not involved in September 11, as Bush later admitted, the opposition to Dubya was less derangement than a deep sense of betrayal.\n\nThe biggest difference here is that before Krauthammer labeled Bush\u2019s critics deranged, George W. already had three years of policies behind him. Hillary Clinton, on the other hand, hasn\u2019t been in the Oval Office a single day, and her presidency is already being treated by some as an unmitigated disaster. What\u2019s more, even members of her own party are getting in on the action. In a recent column for Salon, self-avowed millennial progressive Walter Bragman suggests that Clinton isn\u2019t just a bad candidate \u2014 she\u2019s a threat to the future of the Democratic party itself \u2014 and compares her to the second coming of Reagan, a corrosive force that will destroy the foundation\u2019s of American progressivism.\n\nWe\u2019ve clearly moved past derangement. This is the time of full-on Hillary hysteria.\n\nYou\u2019ve heard all of this before, of course. Hillary Clinton isn\u2019t trustworthy. She isn\u2019t \u201crelatable\u201d or \u201creal.\u201d (However we happen to be defining those words today.) Her so-called likability problem is ancient news by now \u2014 the same nebulous idea that has dogged her all the way back to her time as First Lady. But while these criticisms would be perfect for your anti-Hillary poker night (\u201cB-23 \u2014 ballbusting!\u201d), they\u2019re also indicative of just how much the aversion to her candidacy \u2014 even among those on the left \u2014 is removed from the realm of policy. Even in Bragman\u2019s takedown of Clinton, he begins with her image: \u201cHillary\u2019s personality repels me (and many others).\u201d\n\nBragman reminds us that this isn\u2019t a woman thing \u2014 he\u2019s a feminist, after all \u2014 but it might not be overtly sexist as much as a byproduct of it, as well as the gender hangups of an earlier decade. Leibovitch points this out in his Times article, explaining:\n\n\u201cShe was a working woman and full political partner with (gasp) feminist tendencies. Among would-be first ladies in the early 1990s, these were exotic qualities.\u201d\n\nClinton has continued to occupy that same space for the better part of three decades now, a one-woman culture war who plays the political game the same way the men around her do. But unlike those men, Clinton is chided for being \u201cdisingenuous\u201d and a \u201cpolitical insider.\u201d Everyone else just gets to do their job.\n\nThere are real reasons to have reservations about a Clinton presidency \u2014 including her oft-cited ties to Wall Street and her hawkish foreign policy \u2014 but how often are they the central force of the criticism lodged against her campaign? In an August poll, Quinnipac found that while political respondents felt that Hillary Clinton was \u201cstrong\u201d and a candidate with \u201cexperience,\u201d the words they most associated with her are \u201cliar,\u201d \u201cdishonest,\u201d and \u201cuntrustworthy.\u201d These designations appear to be motivated by her Emailgate scandal and the ongoing questions about Benghazi \u2014 but none of the myriad investigations into either have turned up anything close to a smoking gun.", "article_metadata": {"description": "There are many reasons to be wary of Clinton, but a subset of Democrats seem to be motivated by something else", "title": "The left\u2019s absurd Hillary hate: Why this ridiculous anti-Clinton crusade needs to stop", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "There are many reasons to be wary of Clinton, but a subset of Democrats seem to be motivated by something else", "title": "The left\u2019s absurd Hillary hate: Why this ridiculous anti-Clinton crusade needs to stop", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/12/05/the_ridiculous_left_wing_crusade_against_hillary_clinton_needs_to_stop/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/11/hillary_clinton24.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "There are many reasons to be wary of Clinton, but a subset of Democrats seem to be motivated by something else", "title": "The left\u2019s absurd Hillary hate: Why this ridiculous anti-Clinton crusade needs to stop", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/11/hillary_clinton24.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Nico Lang", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, aol_on, Bernie Sanders, Democratic primary, Editor's Picks, Elections 2016, Hillary Clinton", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Hillary Clinton isn\u2019t trustworthy.\nHillary Clinton, on the other hand, hasn\u2019t been in the Oval Office a single day, and her presidency is already being treated by some as an unmitigated disaster.\nTopics: aol_on, Bernie Sanders, Democratic primary, Editor's Picks, Elections 2016, Hillary Clinton, News, Politics NewsThe media coverage of Hillary Clinton is a lesson in paradox: She\u2019s the \u201cmost admired woman\u201d in America, but no one is \u201cexcited\u201d about her presidential campaign.\nLeibovitch points this out in his Times article, explaining:\u201cShe was a working woman and full political partner with (gasp) feminist tendencies.\nThere are real reasons to have reservations about a Clinton presidency \u2014 including her oft-cited ties to Wall Street and her hawkish foreign policy \u2014 but how often are they the central force of the criticism lodged against her campaign?"}
