Judd Legum responded on Twitter he \u201ccan\u2019t believe Obama is doing this instead of answering questions about Benghazi.\u201d\n\nJudd, of course, was kidding. When Fox News\u2019 Keith Ablow appeared on air this afternoon to address the subject , he wasn\u2019t:\n\n\u201cI\u2019m suspect. I am suspect. Because here\u2019s the thing: why at a time when there\u2019s so many national issues and international issues of such prominence, I am a little suspicious of yet another bread and circus routine. Let\u2019s roll out the marijuana, pull back the laws, and get people even more crazy about yet another entertainment event. \u201cI think this is to distract people. This is like Rome. This is like Rome. I can see why Obama would love the World Cup\u2026. I think it\u2019s interesting that at time when there\u2019s so much to pay attention to of such great import people are playing games \u2013 more than ever.\u201d\n\nAs best as I can tell, he wasn\u2019t kidding.\n\nNote, if the intention of World Cup organizers is \u201cto distract people,\u201d they playing a long game: these events are scheduled many years in advance. The location of the 2022 FIFA World Cup was just recently announced, without any regard for what may or may not be part of current events news coverage at the time.\n\nTo be \u201csuspicious\u201d of an international sporting event scheduled literally eight years ago is to take political paranoia to levels that are probably unhealthy.\n\nThis certainly isn\u2019t to suggest everyone should be interested in the tournament. But why in the world would someone go on national television to suggest the World Cup is part of some kind of plot to distract people?\n\nThe right\u2019s willingness to see every possible development as a deliberate \u201c distraction \u201d from the news they consider important has gotten a little out of hand. Obamacare is a distraction from Fast & Furious, which is a distraction from the IRS \u201cscandal,\u201d which is a distraction from Benghazi, which as of last week is itself a distraction from Benghazi", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "Only on Fox News can one hear theories like these: interest in the World Cup is intended \"to distract people\" from the stories Fox considers important.", "original-source": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/foxs-keith-ablow-little-suspicious-world-cup", "og": {"site_name": "MSNBC", "description": "Only on Fox News can one hear theories like these: interest in the World Cup is intended \"to distract people\" from the stories Fox considers important.", "title": "Fox's Keith Ablow 'a little suspicious' of World Cup", "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/foxs-keith-ablow-little-suspicious-world-cup", "image": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--1_91-1--1200x630/public/articles/451066732.jpg?itok=U8ke0YQ0", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "msnbc.com", "account_id": 2836421, "creator": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/foxs-keith-ablow-little-suspicious-world-cup", "image": {"width": 830, "identifier": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--3-2--512x342/public/articles/451066732.jpg?itok=8vJ4DCPr", "height": 553}, "title": "Fox's Keith Ablow 'a little suspicious' of World Cup", "site": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Only on Fox News can one hear theories like these: interest in the World Cup is intended \"to distract people\" from the stories Fox considers important."}, "robots": "follow, index", "DC.date.issued": "2014-06-26T16:52:39-04:00", "jenga-session-config": "{\"when_to_init\":\"after_dom_ready\"}", "fb": {"app_id": 351594351545594}, "nv": {"author": "steve-benen", "title": "Fox's Keith Ablow 'a little suspicious' of World Cup", "tags": "culture,fox-news,society,sports,world-cup,rachel-maddow-show", "published": 1, "date": "06/26/2014 16:52:39 EDT", "address": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/foxs-keith-ablow-little-suspicious-world-cup"}, "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/steve.benen"}, "abstract": "Only on Fox News can one hear theories like these: interest in the World Cup is intended \"to distract people\" from the stories Fox considers important.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Society, Culture, Fox News, Sports, World Cup"}, "article_summary": "A photo made the rounds this afternoon of President Obama watching World Cup coverage from what appears to be Air Force One.\nBut why in the world would someone go on national television to suggest the World Cup is part of some kind of plot to distract people?\nNote, if the intention of World Cup organizers is \u201cto distract people,\u201d they playing a long game: these events are scheduled many years in advance.\nThe location of the 2022 FIFA World Cup was just recently announced, without any regard for what may or may not be part of current events news coverage at the time.\nI can see why Obama would love the World Cup\u2026."}
