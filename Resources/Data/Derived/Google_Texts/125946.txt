Submitted by Neighborhood Health Plan

September 27, 2013 (Boston) – Neighborhood Health Plan (NHP) announced today that it was named a MassHealth CarePlus Managed Care Plan by the state Executive Office of Health and Human Services (EOHHS). CarePlus is a new benefit plan offered by MassHealth that is designed to meet the requirements of the Affordable Care Act Medicaid expansion and the unique needs of the state health care market. The NHP MassHealth CarePlus plan will be available starting January 1, 2014 to qualified adults ages 21-64 with incomes at or under 133 percent of the Federal Poverty Level.

“We are proud to offer the new MassHealth CarePlus plan to ensure access to high-quality and coordinated health care for individuals in the Commonwealth,” said Deborah C. Enos, NHP President and CEO. “For over 25 years NHP has served Medicaid members, providing reliable and affordable care to a diverse population; and we are well-prepared to help current and potential members navigate the upcoming transition.”

Under the MassHealth CarePlus contract, NHP will collaborate with the state EOHHS to provide a broad range of health benefits for current and future MassHealth members, such as comprehensive medical and behavioral health care, preventive and basic dental services, and routine vision care that includes eyeglasses. CarePlus members will be able to easily transition across MassHealth benefit plan types and between MassHealth and Health Connector plans, allowing for greater continuity of care and minimal disruption as the state implements federal health care reform requirements this fall.

NHP’s coverage includes wellness benefits like mammograms and diabetes screenings at community health centers, and a 24-hour nurse advice line that means members will never have to wait for answers to health questions and concerns. Additionally, NHP has a long history of developing innovative care and chronic disease management programs. With NHP, CarePlus members will have access to intensive case and social care management, integrated medical and behavioral health care, and access to a comprehensive network that includes community health centers, Partners HealthCare and top hospitals in Boston and throughout the state.
