Its claws are razor-sharp. We hope the city will soon catch this rogue bird.\u201d\n\nThe most recent owl assault took place Tuesday night: two members of a local athletic club, out for an evening jog, were attacked by the owl. One runner required stitches. The club has suspended all nighttime activities until further notice.\n\nThe Washington Post reports that the European Eagle Owl is one of the largest owl species in the world, with a wingspan of up to six feet. In its natural habitat, the bird-of-prey eats rabbits, rats, and sometimes, small deer.\n\nOwl expert Gejo Wassink, who admits that they owl\u2019s habit of attacking humans is unusual for the species, has a couple of theories as to why it\u2019s doing it.\n\n\u201cEither the owl was reared in captivity and released into the wild and now associates humans with food \u2013 meaning it\u2019s not really \u2018attacking\u2019 people. Or it may have heightened hormone levels as the breeding season starts, which influences its behaviour and makes it defend its territory.\u201d\n\nRegardless of his or her reasons (Wassink think it\u2019s a female), the town of Purmerend is up to here with the crazed bird and wants it gone. Unfortunately, that\u2019s going to be a problem: European Eagle Owl (Bubo bubo)is a protected species in The Netherlands, even though its conservation status, according to Wikipedia, is \u201cleast concern.\u201d\n\nPurmerend\u2019s town government will seek an exemption to allow them to rid themselves of the bird. In the meantime, they\u2019re warning the residents to be patient and diligent.\n\n\u201cWe want to catch the owl as our city\u2019s residents are in danger. These procedures can still take some time. Meanwhile, we are advising people to stay away from the owl.\u201d\n\n[Image courtesy of: U.S. News and World Report]", "article_metadata": {"description": "A carnivorous, winged creature is terrorizing the people of the Dutch city of Purmerend: a European Eagle Owl has attacked dozens of people in the city, sending", "og": {"site_name": "The Inquisitr News", "description": "A carnivorous, winged creature is terrorizing the people of the Dutch city of Purmerend: a European Eagle Owl has attacked dozens of people in the city, sending", "title": "A Giant Owl Is Terrorizing A Small Dutch City", "url": "http://www.inquisitr.com/1877361/a-giant-owl-is-terrorizing-a-small-dutch-city/", "image": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/European-Eagle-Owl.jpg", "article": {"published_time": "2015-02-26T14:19:29+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-02-26T15:49:07+00:00"}, "type": "article"}, "image": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/European-Eagle-Owl.jpg", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ed1c24", "datePublished": "2015-02-26T14:19:29+00:00", "fb": {"pages": 71179904752, "app_id": 164157850314499}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/assets/0cec37/dist/images/logos/inq-win.png", "keywords": "animal attacks,endangered species,european eagle owl,netherlands,purmerend,animal news", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "y_key": "f282393706a5fd85", "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/European-Eagle-Owl.jpg", "height": 409, "width": 670}, "site": "@theinquisitr", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "A carnivorous, winged creature is terrorizing the people of the Dutch city of Purmerend: a European Eagle Owl has attacked dozens of people in the city, sending"}, "viewport": "width=980"}, "article_summary": "A carnivorous, winged creature is terrorizing the people of the Dutch city of Purmerend: a European Eagle Owl has attacked dozens of people in the city, sending several to the hospital with wounds requiring stitches, The Guardian is reporting.\nThe Washington Post reports that the European Eagle Owl is one of the largest owl species in the world, with a wingspan of up to six feet.\nWe hope the city will soon catch this rogue bird.\u201dThe most recent owl assault took place Tuesday night: two members of a local athletic club, out for an evening jog, were attacked by the owl.\n\u201cEither the owl was reared in captivity and released into the wild and now associates humans with food \u2013 meaning it\u2019s not really \u2018attacking\u2019 people.\n\u201cWe want to catch the owl as our city\u2019s residents are in danger."}
