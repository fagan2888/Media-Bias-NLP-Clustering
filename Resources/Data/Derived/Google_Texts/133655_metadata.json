Taxpayers deserve a proper accounting of how their hard-earned tax dollars are spent.\u201d\n\nFor failing to ensure millions of American\u2019s tax dollars were spent as efficiently as possible, the Coast Guard wins this week\u2019s Golden Hammer Award, a weekly distinction awarded by The Washington Times that highlights examples of questionable spending.\n\n\u201cThis is sloppy, that these guys could do this huge bridge project and still not have the documentation, how difficult is it to document your finances?\u201d said Leslie Paige, vice president and director of communications at the non-partisan Citizens Against Government Waste.\n\nThe audit report comes as DHS is facing a possible shutdown as lawmakers debate a funding package for the agency which has a marked history of wasteful spending habits.\n\n\u201cThis is far from an isolated event. There are numerous instances of mismanagement and improper spending with DHS since its founding,\u201d Ms. Kaeding said.\n\n\u201cFirst we had a bridge to nowhere. Now we have a shovel-ready stimulus bridge which has no protections against Sopranos-like no-show jobs and other shenanigans,\u201d said Ryan Ellis, tax policy director at Americans for Tax Reform in an email to The Washington Times. \u201cWe\u2019re devolving as a political species.\u201d\n\nUnder federal law, it\u2019s up to the bridge owner, BNSF, to select the contractor for the construction project, but the Coast Guard must approve the owner\u2019s selection. Although Coast Guard Bridge Program officials ensured DHS investigators that pre-approval discussion with BNSF had taken place, they could not provide documentation to prove that the most competitive contractor had been selected.\n\n\u201cBecause it did not properly document the discussions, we could not determine whether the Coast Guard thoroughly evaluated the contractors\u2019 costs and expertise to ensure that the selected contractor was the best value for the Government,\u201d investigators wrote.\n\nAdditionally, the Coast Guard relied entirely on BNSF to keep records of changes to construction work orders but those records did not always support the new costs.\n\nOf the 68 work change directives that BNSF sent to the Coast Guard, 20 were approved totaling about $10.9 million, that did not match up with the estimated costs of the work.\n\n\u201cThe WCDs were missing documentation, such as estimates for the expected costs, including estimates for the costs of labor, materials, and overhead. Without such support, the Coast Guard cannot be certain of the cost of work done under these WCDs,\u201d auditors wrote.\n\nThe Coast Guard also did not have a process in place to double check BNSF\u2019s estimations on the amount of materials that could be salvaged from the old bridge to be reused in the new one. Investigators wrote that without that verification, the Coast Guard can\u2019t be sure that it got the best value out of the materials that were available, and might have been able to save more money on the project.\n\nAuditors estimated in the report that the salvageable steel was worth about $184,000, but BNSF only included a salvage value of $10,000.\n\n\u201cThat they could have been so off on that salvage it makes you wonder what their skill set it, this is not a small understanding, this is a very large miss,\u201d Ms. Paige said.\n\nCoast Guard officials attributed the $174,000 difference to break down, shipping, and lead paint remediation costs that were not included in the price quote.\n\nManagement from the Coast Guard\u2019s bridge project insisted that they did maintain accurate documentation throughout the project, but admitted that some of the paperwork did not measure up to audit requirements.\n\n\u201cThe Coast Guard is confident that its documentation fully supports both the $74 million Federal government share and the $8 million Burlington Northern and Santa Fe Railroad share of the total Project cost,\u201d Rear Adm. T.A. Sokalzuk, assistant commandant for resources and CFO wrote in an official response to the audit.\n\nA spokesperson from BNSF did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nMs. Paige pointed out that time and time again auditors measure waste in similar reports but do nothing to ensure their recommendations are implemented, as is the case with DHS\u2019 audit of the bridge project.\n\n\u201cIf in fact some of these agencies could claw back that money, or say \u2018listen, if you don\u2019t have the support documents in place and you can\u2019t prove this, we\u2019re going to take the money back,\u2019 maybe they would get their butts in line, but they don\u2019t do that,\u201d Ms. Paige said.\n\nCoast Guard officials agreed with DHS\u2019 recommendations and planned to maintain better records on future projects. The Defense Contract Audit Agency will conduct a final contract close out audit for the project.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Call it a case of money under the bridge, but the Coast Guard, which keeps America safe by patrolling U.S. waterways, can't effectively manage the flow of millions of tax dollars spent on bridge construction projects.", "Author": "Kellan Howell", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Call it a case of money under the bridge, but the Coast Guard, which keeps America safe by patrolling U.S. waterways, can\u2019t effectively manage the flow of millions of tax dollars spent on bridge construction projects.", "title": "GOLDEN HAMMER: Coast Guard mismanages millions in bridge construction projects", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/feb/26/golden-hammer-coast-guard-mismanages-millions-in-b/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/01/15/hammertime-2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/01/15/hammertime-2.jpg", "title": "GOLDEN HAMMER: Coast Guard mismanages millions in bridge construction", "description": "Call it a case of money under the bridge, but the Coast Guard, which keeps America safe by patrolling U.S. waterways, can't effectively manage the flow of millions of tax dollars spent on bridge const", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "news_keywords": "Bnsf, Leslie Paige"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe074d\"", "article_summary": "The report highlights just one bridge project \u2014 as of July 2014, the Coast Guard was managing 13 bridge alteration orders.\nWithout such support, the Coast Guard cannot be certain of the cost of work done under these WCDs,\u201d auditors wrote.\nCoast Guard officials agreed with DHS\u2019 recommendations and planned to maintain better records on future projects.\nCall it a case of money under the bridge, but the Coast Guard, which keeps America safe by patrolling U.S. waterways, can\u2019t effectively manage the flow of millions of tax dollars spent on bridge construction projects.\nCoast Guard officials attributed the $174,000 difference to break down, shipping, and lead paint remediation costs that were not included in the price quote."}
