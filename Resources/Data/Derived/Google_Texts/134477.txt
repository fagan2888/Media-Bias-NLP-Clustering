WOONSOCKET, R.I. — CVS Health announced Thursday that MinuteClinic, the company’s retail clinic medical clinic, has opened its 1,000th location in Washington, D.C. at the CVS/pharmacy location on Dupont Circle.

“This 1,000th clinic milestone reflects our commitment to expand much needed access to health care across the United States,” MinuteClinic president and CVS Health’s EVP and associate chief medical officer Andrew Sussman said. “Whether it's treating patients in urban centers like Washington, D.C. or developing new ways to deliver care in other settings, the MinuteClinic mission to provide accessible health care will continue to evolve.

MinuteClinic opened its first retail clinic 15 years ago, and since then has expanded to reach communities in 31 states and the District of Columbia, providing more than 26 million patient visits. With this milestone, MinuteClinic and CVS Health are still looking to the future, eyeing new partnerships and ways to expand care.

“n the years ahead, we intend to offer new and innovative medical services to patients through in-store clinics, expanded telehealth services and clinical collaborations with a growing list of more than 60 major health care system affiliates nationwide,” Sussman said.
