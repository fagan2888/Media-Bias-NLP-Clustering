( Facebook )\n\nJoin us on the new C-Pop podcast where Taylor and Jessilyn discuss, debate and sometimes deride pop culture with a strong sense of humor and a focus on Christ. Listen at charismapodcastnetwork.com.\n\nUnintentional humor is always the best.\n\nBeyond the fact that it\u2019s full of several glaring self-contradictions, liberal Hollywood\u2019s latest ham-fisted attempt at propaganda, Elysium, could be the most racist film since the infamous Birth of a Nation.\n\nThe movie is meant to be a sympathetic allegory for amnesty for illegals and Obamacare. The rich (mostly white) people live on an outer space Valhalla, while the poor (mainly minorities) are forced to remain on Planet Earth.\n\nApparently the filmmakers don\u2019t believe the black and Latino people left behind on Earth would be capable of actually building a civilized society if all the rich and (mostly) white people left. What about all those historically significant civilizations we learned about on our politically correct college campuses?\n\nOur elitist college professors\u2014who are mostly white and well-off, by the way\u2014taught us these civilizations were reportedly heaven on earth until the white man showed up to pollute them with his Christo-fascist imperialism. If that interpretation of history is correct, then wouldn\u2019t these people actually be better off if all those rich and (mostly) white people left the planet?\n\nMatt Damon is the only main character in the movie that is white and still left on Earth. Meanwhile, all the earthly minority characters surrounding Damon\u2014save one\u2014are portrayed as slothful and/or violent criminals. There are even scenes involving minority characters mocking the white Damon as he shuffles off to his low-level factory job, and they attempt to cajole Damon into quitting his job and joining them in their criminal activity instead.\n\nStereotype much?\n\nAccording to Elysium, minorities are not only too savage to build a civilized society without all the rich and (mostly) white folks there to show the way, but they can\u2019t organize resistance to the movie\u2019s misguided definition of tyranny on their own, either. Rather, it\u2019s the white Damon that has to act selflessly and sacrificially to spur them into action. Without Damon, the minorities are mired in widespread immorality, drug use, corruption and gang activity.\n\nThe movie never tells us why its minorities on Earth can\u2019t succeed without rich and (mostly) white people around. The movie never tells us why its minorities seemingly have the ingenuity to steal from one another as well as the rich and (mostly) white people on Elysium but aren\u2019t willing to use their ingenuity to make Earth a better place for those who remain.\n\nMeanwhile, the rich and (mostly) white people on Elysium have built a civilization that benefits everyone there. How come they\u2019re able to rise above their base nature and the minorities on Earth are not? Are minorities not capable of doing the same, or can they only do it when white folks are there to show them how it\u2019s done?\n\nAt best, such a notion is offensively patronizing. At worst, it\u2019s a racist caricature.\n\nSo it turns out that while attempting to make the argument for a more progressive society, Elysium actually makes a movie that puts forth several offensive mythologies white supremacists would agree with.\n\nThis is what happens when those who claim they\u2019re open-minded and tolerant surround themselves with only the like-minded. Nobody bothers to stand up and ask a critical-thinking question about what they\u2019re really trying to say here.\n\nThis is what happens when your main star claims to be a liberal champion of public schools. Then, after it\u2019s revealed he\u2019s sending his children to an exclusive private school, he says that\u2019s because the kind of education he wants his children to have \u201cno longer exists\u201d in the crummy schools he thinks the rest of our children should be subjected to.\n\nThen again, Damon\u2019s latest movie says I should expect such hypocritical elitism from rich white folks like Damon. He seemed like a natural in his role. Now we know why.\n\nDraw closer to God. Experience the presence of the Holy Spirit every month as you read Charisma magazine.
