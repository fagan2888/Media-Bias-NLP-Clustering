Sure, that was partially thanks to ringers like Jimmy Fallon and (the enduringly hilarious) Weird Al, but plenty of 2014\u2019s most infectious laughs still came from amateur auteurs harnessing the awesome power of the Internet. Here are 10 silly web clips from the last 12 months we\u2019re comfortable naming as the objective best, if for no reason other than you\u2019ll probably forget all about this once the next big cat video comes out.\n\n10. Dancing Kid \u201cGoes Full Diva\u201d on Live TV\n\nSince Brendan Jordan\u2019s glorious television debut, the 15-year-old has been on Ellen, The Queen Latifah Show and even modeled for American Apparel. But before all that he was just a fierce, scene-stealing boy voguing his heart out on the local news. God bless you, Diva Kid.\n\n9. Farmer Treats Cows to Trombone Serenade\n\nSome might attribute the popularity of dumb Internet videos to our allegedly shrinking attention spans, but \u201cSerenading the cattle with my trombone (Lorde \u2013 Royals)\u201d serves as a compelling counterexample to that theory. A classic slow-burner, the clip rewards viewers for their patience above all else, coming to a immensely satisfying (if not particularly surprising) conclusion.\n\n8. President Obama Visits Between Two Ferns\n\nThere isn\u2019t a lot to say about this video of the President and Zach Galifianakis trading barbs on a nearly empty sound stage, other than it was absolutely wonderful. Ostensibly promoting the Affordable Care Act, the exchange managed to make health care reform funny, a feat that surely deserves a spot in the Making Boring Stuff Interesting Hall of Fame.\n\n7. Brian Williams Goes Old School with \u201cRapper\u2019s Delight\u201d\n\nAfter taking over The Tonight Show in February, Jimmy Fallon quickly established his place in the late-night television landscape, thanks in large part to web-friendly segments like the one seen above. A later iteration showing the NBC Nightly News anchor rapping \u201cGin and Juice\u201d may have been just a bit funnier, but this one came first, airing just days into Fallon\u2019s tenure.\n\n6. Old Man Breaks it Down to \u201cRock Around The Clock\u201d\n\nAlmost six months after Dancing Old Guy made his Internet debut, this anonymous old man\u2019s smokin\u2019 moves still amaze. Can you think of a slicker move than dude\u2019s double cane toss? You cannot.\n\n5. \u201cAll By Myself\u201d in McCarran International\n\nHeartbreak can be hard, but a long, unexpected layover will crush your soul. This guerrilla video for C\u00e9line Dion\u2019s \u201cAll By Myself\u201d shot in an empty Las Vegas airport proved as much when it hit the Internet this June, coming out even sadder than the 1996 original.\n\n4. Emma Stone Lip Sync Battles Jimmy Fallon\n\nOf the Fallon-helmed Tonight Show\u2019s recurring bits, none has been bigger than Lip Sync Battles. And of those Lip Sync Battles, none was more celebrated than Fallon\u2019s April showdown with The Amazing Spider-Man\u2019s Emma Stone. Now Lip Sync Battles is being developed as its own spinoff series, surely thanks in no small part to Stone\u2019s scorching rendition of \u201cAll I Do is Win\u201d seen above.\n\n3. Weird Al Yankovic \u2013 \u201cWord Crimes\u201d\n\nWhen Weird Al announced his ambitious \u201ceight videos in eight days\u201d plan earlier this year, few could have predicted how well it would pay off, eventually earning Yankovic his first number one record. Arguably the best of these releases (and the most popular by a mile) was the animated video for \u201cWord Crimes,\u201d an ode to grammatical pedantry that managed to partially rehabilitate the super-skeezy smash hit it riffed on.\n\n2. Hero Cat Saves Child From Dog Attack\n\nLots of cat video stars can be described as cute, but far fewer can be called courageous, like the brave feline seen protecting a four-year-old boy from a random dog attack in this much-watched clip. Tara the Cat rocketed to superstardom soon after the amazing security cam footage hit the web, debuting at 22 on Friskies\u2019 authoritative list of the 50 Most Influential Cats.\n\n1. Apparently Kid\n\nApparently, we think this was the best viral video of 2014. Because apparently, this interview with 5-year-old Noah Ritter has all the classic elements of a great YouTube offering, apparently including a cute kid, a local news broadcast and an easy to remember catchphrase. And apparently, the insanely popular clip has since been viewed over 17 million times.
