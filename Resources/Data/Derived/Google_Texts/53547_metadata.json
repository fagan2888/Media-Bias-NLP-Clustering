Today, the company\u2019s scope in the town of 20,000 has nearly faded from view.\n\nStill, its influence lingers. Land donated from Kodak to the town became Eastman Park; Weld County Road 66 became Eastman Park Drive; and places such as Windsor\u2019s library and fire department became recipients of large monetary donations from the company.\n\nKodak even once helped pay for half of Windsor\u2019s sewer system improvements, contributing to the general infrastructure of the town.\n\n\u201cIt was very exciting, especially if you came out here from Rochester, where everything was pretty stoic,\u201d said Bud Miller, who moved his family from the company\u2019s New York headquarters in 1971 and settled in Loveland to work at the Windsor facility. \u201cTo come out here and be able to have a fresh start with new facility and more freedom, it was exciting.\u201d\n\nAnd the company, according to Windsor\u2019s Arts and Heritage Manager Carrie Knight, brought more than just Kodak employees to town.\n\n\u201cKodak\u2019s presence in Windsor really helped the community move forward in the way of entertaining different business opportunities,\u201d Knight said. \u201cKodak gave our community a great deal of leverage in attracting new businesses to this community.\u201d\n\nAt the time of Kodak\u2019s decision to build in Windsor, the town had been struggling after the closure of its main economic driver, the Great Western Sugar Co. After the photo giant\u2019s arrival, however, the town was able to benefit greatly from the international company\u2019s generosity and economic pull.\n\nBut, just as fiercely as it had burst onto the scene so many years ago, sales dropped, jobs were slashed and the company\u2019s role in Windsor dwindled to almost nothing until it sold the Colorado facility last April to its largest creditor, Kodak Alaris, which recently announced more job cuts at the site.\n\nIt seems that the company once responsible for bolstering a small, floundering Northern Colorado town, in the end, may not be able to save itself.\n\n\u201cKodak basically owned the photography businesses for a long, long time, but they made errors along the way,\u201d said Miller, who worked there for 27 years before retiring in 1991.\n\nKodak, by 1976, had accounted for 90 percent of film and 85 percent of camera sales in America, according to The Economist. In 1988, it employed more than 145,000 people across the world and reported its highest revenues at almost $16 billion in 1996.\n\nAt one point, the Windsor facility alone employed thousands, Kodak spokesman Chris Veronda previously told the Coloradoan.\n\nThe rise of digital photography and advances in technology\u2014such as smartphones that double as cameras\u2014ended up posing the ultimate challenge to the once-great photography pioneer, according to The Economist.\n\nThe company began emptying out some buildings on the Windsor campus in 2007, cut hundreds of jobs at the facility in 2009, leveled four of its buildings in 2011 and sold off pieces of its land the following year.\n\nIn January 2012, after seeing its share price plummet almost 90 percent the year before and reporting hundreds of millions of dollars in losses, Eastman Kodak filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy and spent much of 2012 making executive changes, cutting jobs and ending several retiree benefits to save money.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a mere shadow of what it once was, and I feel sorry for those folks who are burdened with trying to make it a world-class organization again; they\u2019ve got their work ahead of them,\u201d Miller said. \u201cI wish them all the luck in the world.\u201d\n\nKodak Alaris, a company separate from Kodak, which now owns and runs the Windsor site, cut 10 percent of its workforce\u2014roughly 20 jobs\u2014earlier this month.\n\nMore than 200 people now work at the facility, said Kodak Alaris Worldwide Communications Director Audrey Jonckheer.\n\n\u201c(Windsor) is going to continue to be a key manufacturing site for us,\u201d Jonckheer said, adding that the facility is the worldwide supplier of Kodak Alaris\u2019s thermal donor ribbons and display film products as well as the site of its regional finishing operations for color negative paper and thermal products.\n\n\u201cThe changes in staffing really are part of a plan to drive efficiency, and people may not quite understand that, but oftentimes in order to streamline efficiency sometimes those sort of staffing changes do need to take place,\u201d Jonckheer said.\n\nFrom Kodak Alaris\u2019s perspective, the Windsor site remains an important piece of its business now and in the future, she added.\n\nBud Miller\u2019s daughter, Stacy Johnson, was\u2014at 5 weeks old\u2014possibly the youngest Kodak transplant to come to Colorado for Kodak.\n\nJohnson now works in Windsor as director of the town\u2019s economic development department.\n\nWhile mentioning Kodak bringing numerous jobs to the area and attracting other businesses and companies to Windsor, Johnson said the town is not just looking back on the company\u2019s contributions.\n\n\u201cWhile they brought a lot and they meant a lot to Windsor, I think we will continue to look toward the future to fill the vacancies that occur as they downsize and if they decide to leave completely,\u201d Johnson said.\n\nEchoing Johnson\u2019s thoughts, Knight, spoke of how important Kodak has been to the town and what it\u2019s meant for the area\u2019s future.\n\n\u201cVery early on, I think Windsor had an understanding that it had a partner, a community partner, in Kodak,\u201d Knight said, noting its many contributions to the town.\n\n\u201cI think that Kodak remains a presence in the community, and we have much to be thankful for their presence here, but we understand that things change so quickly in the economic climate of Northern Colorado, and I think that they\u2019ve provided us good preparation for moving into that next chapter,\u201d Knight said.\n\nAs for the change in Kodak\u2019s presence within the town, Knight said she thinks the community has felt it \u201ckeenly,\u201d especially the people, including Miller, who worked at the site for years.\n\n\u201cThere were some fun days and I have some good memories,\u201d Miller recalled. \u201cI think I was just lucky to live through that era and be part of it all because it really was a great place to work.\u201d\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nInformation from: Fort Collins Coloradoan, http://www.coloradoan.com", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "200 Kodak Alaris jobs remain in Windsor after sale", "title": "200 Kodak Alaris jobs remain in Windsor after sale", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/01/20/200-kodak-alaris-jobs-remain-in-windsor-after-sale-2/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "height": 630}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-01-20T12:06:51+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-01-20T12:06:51+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "WINDSOR, Colo.\u2014For decades, Windsor was, by all accounts, a Kodak town.\nFrom Kodak Alaris\u2019s perspective, the Windsor site remains an important piece of its business now and in the future, she added.\nAt one point, the Windsor facility alone employed thousands, Kodak spokesman Chris Veronda previously told the Coloradoan.\nEastman Kodak Company opened its Colorado division on the edge of Windsor in the late 1960s, where the film giant quickly employed hundreds, then thousands.\nMore than 200 people now work at the facility, said Kodak Alaris Worldwide Communications Director Audrey Jonckheer."}
