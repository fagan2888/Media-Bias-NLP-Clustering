But a new study suggests this isn't the case, and even alludes to a higher risk with their use.\n\nIf cholesterol-lowering statins were able to prevent Parkinson\u2019s disease, we\u2019d have a powerful new way to prevent or delay the neurodegenerative disease. However, the research on its effectiveness in doing that is shaky; a new study shakes things up even more, finding that statins may not only be unable to lower Parkinson\u2019s risk but possibly even worsen it.\n\nParkinson\u2019s, which affects an estimated one million people and is newly diagnosed in up to 60,000 people each year, is caused by the malfunction and death of the brain\u2019s dopamine cells. These cells are vital to movement and coordination. As a result of this destruction, the body ends up experiencing symptoms like tremors in the hands, arms, legs, and face; bradykinesia, or slower body movement; stiff limbs, and postural instability.\n\nPrevious research has suggested statins\u2019 could cross the blood-brain barrier and, with their anti-inflammatory properties, provide neuroprotective benefits to the dopaminergic pathways. However, according to the new research, these neuroprotective benefits may actually come from having high cholesterol, particularly LDL (low-density lipoprotein, or \u201cbad\u201d cholesterol) rather than from taking the statins to treat it.\n\n\u201cWe confirmed our previous finding that high total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol were associated with a lower risk of PD (Parkinson\u2019s disease),\u201d said Xuemei Huang, an author of the study and professor of neurology at Penn State College of Medicine, in a press release. \u201cMoreover, statin use over the course of the study did not protect against PD, and in fact appeared to increase PD risk in the long term.\u201d\n\nHuang admitted the study\u2019s sample size was small, only involving 56 cases of Parkinson\u2019s. But the preliminary data behind the findings, Huang says, is strong. For one, some research suggests Parkinson\u2019s may begin outside the brain; as cholesterol is produced, so is a compound called coenzyme Q10, which energizes cells and has shown hints of being able to protect nerve cells. As statins reduce cholesterol, they may also reduce levels of Q10, making the body vulnerable to developing Parkinson\u2019s.\n\nMoreover, Huang noted that most of the studies linking statins to lower Parkinson\u2019s risk failed to account for cholesterol levels prior to widespread statin use in the U.S. So, Huang\u2019s team looked at blood cholesterol levels, medications used, and Parkinson\u2019s diagnoses in a group of people who participated in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study between 1987 and 1998 \u2014 before statins were widely used.\n\n\u201cStatins have been proven to be effective in the primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular events and stroke,\u201d Huang said. \u201cAlthough some have proposed that statins might be a \u2018cure-all\u2019 drug, this might be a case where what\u2019s good for the heart isn\u2019t good for the brain.\u201d More research will eventually determine whether statins are beneficial or not for Parkinson\u2019s, but until then, Huang urged caution among physicians promoting the benefits of statins for Parkinson\u2019s. \u201cThis is evidence that personalized medicine is better than a one-size-fits-all approach.\u201d\n\nSource: Huang X, Alvaro A, Guo X, et al.
