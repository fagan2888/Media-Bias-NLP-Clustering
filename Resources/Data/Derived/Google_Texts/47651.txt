The RNC has launched a website dedicated exclusively to exposing Hillary Clinton’s email scandal, ensuring the public knows the facts as we inch closer to the 2016 election.

ClintonEmailFacts.gop is the “definitive source for facts, figures, and developments in Hillary’s email scandal,” the homepage states.

Those interested can browse categories on the site that include the rules she broke, expert opinions, a quick fact sheet to bring people up to speed on the story, and more.

“Clinton’s unprecedented email arrangement was an egregious error in judgment that jeopardized the nation’s most sensitive intelligence,” RNC Chairman Reince Priebus said in a statement. “Hillary Clinton and her campaign have attempted to distract, deceive, and confuse the American people about the truth, and this site breaks down the facts so voters understand the full scope of her reckless conduct. The truth is that on more than 2,000 occasions, Hillary Clinton sent or received classified information that ultimately put our national security and sensitive diplomatic efforts at risk. The ongoing investigation by the FBI, coupled with Clinton’s arrogant and dishonest claims, shows she can’t be trusted with the presidency.”
