(Bill Clark/CQ Roll Call)\n\nRic Davis takes note of the commuter crowd \u2014 how it has morphed from juggling books and laptops to staring into cellphones and tablets.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like watching history unfold,\u201d he said. \u201cEverybody is sitting there with a mobile device.\u201d\n\nThen the daily Metro rider gets to work, where for 23 years he has overseen the modernization of the federal government's publishing arm.\n\nAs the Government Publishing Office\u2019s chief technology officer, Davis is tasked with using the latest tools to manage massive blocks of official information from the Congressional Record to the Federal Register and beyond.\n\nDavis used what he saw on the go to focus efforts on developing a better mobile platform for the millions of people who download documents from the agency. It\u2019s part of a bigger push to modernize the office's online presence starting Wednesday by publicly beta testing govinfo.gov.\n\nHe\u2019s worked on getting government\u2019s records online since it began doing so under a very different technological period in 1993. That\u2019s the year Congress gave the agency the OK to begin digitizing volumes of records \u2014 and before the Internet was part of everyday life.\n\nThe first documents the agency digitized were created by programs that predate Microsoft Word on a search engine that no longer exists, Davis said.\n\nA user at the time had to zero-in on particular parts of plain text documents hundreds of pages long to find what they needed, Program Manager Lisa LaPlant said.\n\n\u201cBasically just a flat file system with a really rudimentary search,\u201d LaPlant said. \u201cLike really, really basic.\u201d\n\nA major overhaul in 2009 led to gpo.gov , where digital signatures and new authenticating measures were introduced \u2014 a move inspired by a report printed by the agency on the Space Shuttle Columbia disaster that was widely publicized.\n\nOn govinfo.gov \u2014 which the Government Publishing Office\u2019s spokesman declared \u201cthe Google for government documents\u201d \u2014 users can access the Congressional Record, track the course of legislation or perhaps dive into a treasure trove of information specifically on President Gerald Ford.\n\nGovernment geekery aside, anyone from the general public may punch out \u201cObamacare\u201d and get a copy of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act \u2014 the agency\u2019s most popular document at 14 million downloads in the last six years.\n\nSince 2009, the office has managed 2 billion downloads total \u2014 or nine downloads per second \u2014 by stakeholders across the country who consist of academics, lawyers, researchers and lawmakers.\n\nThe Government Publishing Office is a legislative agency but publishes information for all three branches of government. It recently started storing opinions from judges inside more than 100 federal courtrooms across the U.S.\n\nGovinfo.gov will operate in beta testing mode for one year while the agency gathers feedback from users. A permanent website is expected in 2017.\n\nImproving its online presence is the latest effort by the agency to transition into the digital age \u2014 but the office\u2019s printers still hum and buzz on the first three floors of a building that takes up an entire city block just off Capitol Hill.\n\nThousands of pages on president\u2019s budget are being prepared for publication next week on one floor.\n\nOn another, work on tickets to the inauguration has begun \u2014 minus the honoree\u2019s name.\n\nBut moving to a digital-only platform is one more step toward the agency catching up with the times.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what people are starting to expect,\" LaPlant said.\n\nContact Rahman at remarahman@cqrollcall.com or follow her on Twitter at @remawriter Related: GPO to Digitize Federal Register Issue From \u2018Printing\u2019 to \u2018Publishing': The GPO Has a New Name New CEO Tries to Rebrand and Revamp GPO GPO First Legislative Agency to Move to the Cloud See photos, follies, HOH Hits and Misses and more at Roll Call's new video site.
