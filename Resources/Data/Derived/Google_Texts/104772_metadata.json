We did fumble the ball on it. And what I'm going to do is make sure that we get that fixed.\"\n\nGridiron analogies have proved useful to Obama in the past. On the 2012 campaign trail, Obama \u2014 a Chicago Bears fan \u2014 employed an extended football metaphor to explain Mitt Romney's economic plan, concluding it should be \"punted away.\"\n\nAnd when Obama was pushing his health care proposal through Congress in the first place, he was known to use a football field to show how close they were to succeeding. About a month and a half before he signed the bill, Obama said they were on \"the five-yard line.\"\n\n\"We're in the red zone,\" Obama said at a February 2010 Nashua, N.H. town hall, referring to the area of the field between the 20-yard line and the goal line. \"We've got to punch it through.\"\n\nHis recent predecessors also had a habit of leaning on sports analogies when they wanted to convey ideas to the American public in simpler terms. As President George W. Bush, a former co-owner of baseball's Texas Rangers, was wrapping his tenure in the Oval Office, he often liked to say \"I'm going to sprint to the finish.\"\n\nAhead of the 2006 mid-term elections, as Democrats appeared poised for a major victory, Bush warned his rivals to not celebrate prematurely.\n\n\"They're dancing in the end zone,\" Bush said at a September 2006 news conference. \"They just haven't scored the touchdown.\"\n\nBut the Democrats were ultimately able to spike the ball that November, gaining 31 seats in the House of Representatives, enough to take control of the chamber.\n\nPresident Bill Clinton, who appeared on the cover of Sports Illustrated in 1994 wearing an Arkansas Razorbacks jacket and holding a basketball, also used sports analogies from time to time, even to help clarify his second-term decision to take military action in Kosovo.\n\n\"I will say again, this is not a slam dunk,\" Clinton said in a March 1999 speech. \"This is a difficult issue. This is a difficult decision. I believe that the position I have taken is the best of a lot of bad alternatives.\"", "article_metadata": {"Rating": "General", "description": "It came as little surprise that President Obama, an avid sports fan, leaned heavily on sports metaphors at his press conference Thursday to help explain the problems the administration has experienced rolling out the Affordable Care Act.
