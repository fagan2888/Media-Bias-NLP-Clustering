The ACLU accuses Mercy Health Partners of negligence for, among other things, failing to direct Tamesha Means to a hospital that could have safely terminated her nonviable pregnancy after her water broke at only 18 weeks gestation.\n\nThe details of the hospital staff\u2019s conduct can be found in the complaint. According to the ACLU, Means miscarried as Mercy Health staff members were preparing to discharge her\u2014for the third time in two days.\n\nIt might be tempting to view the lawsuit as another attempt by pro-choice activists to force pro-lifers to subsidize or participate in conduct inimical to their moral convictions. But the facts of the case may well point to negligence. I make no claim either way.\n\nInstead, I wish to point out that Tamesha Means could not have easily gone to another hospital, perhaps one offering the full range of women\u2019s health services, because there is no such hospital. Mercy Health is the only hospital in Muskegon County (population 170,000) and the only one within 30 minutes of Means\u2019 home.\n\nMichigan is one of 28 states that artificially caps the number of hospital beds available in a given region. To open or expand a hospital, health providers must first obtain a \u201ccertificate of need\u201d (CON) by convincing state health planners that there is a need for more beds. (Another eight states have CON laws, but have rescinded their rules on hospital beds.)\n\nCON proponents argue that providers will fill every bed they build room for, so restrictions on hospital bed inventories are necessary to hold down costs. Planners also want to ensure the number of beds is sufficient to meet a community\u2019s needs. Michigan thus employs a complicated formula purported to arrive at the precise number of beds necessary to supply, but not oversupply, the market.\n\nUsing the formula, Michigan\u2019s Department of Community Health has determined that the Muskegon region has too many beds\u2014exactly 203 too many, in fact. Thus, any potential competitor wishing to enter the market would certainly be denied permission.\n\nOf course, eliminating waste is all to the good. But labeling all health care delivered after a certain point excessive is ham-handed. One wonders what planners think is happening in the 203 extraneous beds\u2014each day all year. Is each patient who makes use of those beds receiving extraneous care? Of course not\u2014some varying portion of the cost of care for every patient who walks through the door is inflated or otherwise inefficient.\n\nUsing certificate-of-need laws to combat costs is an attempt to treat the symptom while ignoring the disease. Moreover, it\u2019s a futile attempt. According to the Federal Trade Commission and multiple academics, the preponderance of the evidence suggests CON laws do not actually restrain health costs.\n\nDespite this evidence, CON laws have their defenders. State hospital lobbies, like the Michigan Health & Hospital Association, naturally welcome rules that protect their profits and clobber potential rivals. Other CON proponents are well-intentioned good-government types who do not trust competition to bring about good outcomes for patients.\n\nBut perhaps Tamesha Means would have been better served if the state allowed a competing hospital or two to serve Muskegon.\n\nAccording to the ACLU, many Catholic hospitals will not terminate a pregnancy until the fetus\u2019 heartbeat stops of its own accord\u2014even when the mother\u2019s life is at risk. Maybe that\u2019s wrong. But using the courts to force Catholic providers to violate deeply held beliefs seems a fruitless strategy. Catholic hospitals are unlikely to implement the ACLU\u2019s policy wish list no matter who wins the case.\n\nA truly pro-choice plan of action would focus on repealing laws that circumscribe patients\u2019 ability to choose from a variety of health providers.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://reason.com/archives/2013/12/07/stupid-laws-cause-dangerous-hospital-sho", "site_name": "Reason.com", "type": "article", "description": "Despite popular misconception, this is not a pro-choice vs. pro-life situation.", "title": "Stupid Laws Cause Dangerous Hospital Shortages"}, "twitter": {"description": "This week, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) filed a\nfederal lawsuit alleging mistreatment of a woman in the days\nleading up to her miscarriage at a Catholic hospital in Muskegon,\nMichigan.
