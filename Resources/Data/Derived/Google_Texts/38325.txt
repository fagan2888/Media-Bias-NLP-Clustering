Four men have been arrested following a pursuit early Saturday morning in Harvey County.

An officer patrolling around 3:30 a.m. in a neighborhood saw a suspicious vehicle, Newton police said on Facebook. The officer attempted to stop the white Chevy Monte Carlo near Anderson and Meadowbrook Drive, but the car sped away.

Police said speeds reached 90 miles-per-hour. Deputies from the Harvey County Sheriffâ€™s Office and an officer from Halstead joined the pursuit.

The car stopped after becoming disabled in the 6300 block of West Road. The four people inside the car got out and ran.

The driver was quickly taken into custody, and a K-9 tracked a second suspect who was found hiding in a nearby grassy area. Officers also found the third suspect and took him into custody.

The fourth and final suspect was arrested at a rural Harvey County home later in the morning.

Police said the car was stolen several days prior. The 20-year-old driver is from Wichita. He was booked for felony theft, eluding police, DUI, and being a minor in possession of alcohol. His name was not released.

The three remaining suspects were booked for obstruction. On top of that, a 19-year-old Hutchinson man also faces a charge of being a minor in possession of alcohol; a 20-year-old Harvey County man was booked for possession of marijuana and paraphernalia. The third suspect is also a 20-year-old from Harvey County.

Police provided no further details.
