Co-ops did not want to start offering coverage and then have to shut down in the middle of next year.\n\nMany of the beleaguered co-ops have blamed low payouts from an ObamaCare program known as risk corridors. That program was designed to protect insurers against heavy losses by collecting money from insurers doing well and giving it to insurers faring poorly. But the Obama administration announced on Oct. 1 that the program had only taken in enough funds to pay out 12.6 percent of the $2.87 billion that insurers had requested.\n\n\u201cThe government\u2019s refusal to honor its risk corridor obligations represents a negative financial impact of over $20 million,\u201d said Dawn Bonder, CEO of the Oregon co-op Health Republic Insurance. \u201cThis has placed us in a difficult financial position that could jeopardize our members and partners. As a result, we believe the most ethical step is for Health Republic to refrain from entering the market in 2016 and begin an orderly wind down of business.\u201d\n\nColorado HealthOP co-op stood out from the others by protesting the decision of the state Division of Insurance to shut it down.\n\n\"We are astonished and disappointed by the Colorado Division of Insurance's decision,\u201d the co-op\u2019s CEO, Julia Hutchins, said in a statement. \u201cIt is both irresponsible and premature.\u201d\n\nThe co-op said that it is profitable and in a \u201cstrong financial position.\u201d\n\nThe Colorado Division of Insurance attributed its decision to the low risk corridors payments collected by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS).\n\n\u201cOur decision is a direct result of this shortfall by CMS, and I sympathize with the HealthOP, but the Division has requirements and it has to protect consumers,\u201d Colorado Insurance Commissioner Marguerite Salazar said in a statement.", "article_metadata": {"page-title": "21 of 23 Obamacare insurance co-ops are losing money.", "pinterest": "nopin", "og": {"site_name": "PJ Media", "description": "21 of 23 Obamacare insurance co-ops are losing money.", "title": "Two More Obamacare Co-Ops Shuttering their Doors", "url": "https://pjmedia.com/blog/two-more-obamacare-co-ops-shuttering-their-doors/", "image": "https://pajamasmed.hs.llnwd.net/e1/user-content/31/files/2015/10/00031.jpg", "updated_time": 1464238843, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "21 of 23 Obamacare insurance co-ops are losing money.", "title": "Two More Obamacare Co-Ops Shuttering their Doors", "url": "https://pjmedia.com/blog/two-more-obamacare-co-ops-shuttering-their-doors/", "image": "https://pajamasmed.hs.llnwd.net/e1/user-content/31/files/2015/10/00031.jpg", "site": "@PJMedia_com", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "21 of 23 Obamacare insurance co-ops are losing money.", "pinterestDescription": "Two More Obamacare Co-Ops Shuttering their Doors", "fb": {"app_id": 149848758413844}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0390\"", "article_summary": "Many of the beleaguered co-ops have blamed low payouts from an ObamaCare program known as risk corridors.\n\"We are astonished and disappointed by the Colorado Division of Insurance's decision,\u201d the co-op\u2019s CEO, Julia Hutchins, said in a statement.\nObamacare non-profit co-op insurance organizations in Colorado and Oregon are shutting down, making it 7 out of 23 non-profits to have closed in the last year.\nThe Hill:This month marks an important time for co-ops to decide whether they will continue, with the sign-up period for next year\u2019s ObamaCare coverage beginning Nov. 1.\nCo-ops did not want to start offering coverage and then have to shut down in the middle of next year."}
