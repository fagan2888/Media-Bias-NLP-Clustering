Obviously we are within five points of the senator in a poll that has a margin of error of [4.2] percent, and that our different sort of campaign that we\u2019re running is working, in going to the rural parts of the state or the urban parts of the state, and meeting people where they live and looking them in the eye and shaking their hand and them getting to know what I stand for and me being able to address or hear their concerns that they have,\u201d continued Taylor.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re pleased with where we\u2019re at,\u201d he said.\n\nRegarding the Economy:\n\n\u201cIf you look at how to grow an economy overall, what you have to understand is the economic principles that lead to job creation and job growth,\u201d said Taylor.\n\nAs an example, Chad Taylor referred to the NBAF facility in Manhattan, Kansas.\n\n\u201cUnderstanding how the synergy between the private sector and the public sector works together, that\u2019s a facility within the bioscience corridor, which provides us a phenomenal opportunity to grow good paying jobs in our community that can\u2019t be exported,\u201d said Taylor.\n\nTaylor told KSN that with his experience as district attorney, he understands the principles of how economics works.\n\n\u201cUnderstanding how those synergies work together in building coalitions, it\u2019s all in a transferable skill set,\u201d added Taylor.\n\n\u201cOne of the first things that I would do is push for an initiative that we get back to the point that we haven\u2019t been to since 2009, when we actually passed a budget in the U.S. Congress,\u201d said Taylor. \u201cGet off this roller-coaster of continuing resolution after continuing resolution, and go back and utilize pay go budgeting rules, which require transparency on the part of the congress and will identify where every dollar of spending is going to come from.\u201d\n\nTaylor continued, \u201cIf you wanna move money out of this pot to this pot over here, it has to be identified, or if you want to increase deficit spending that has to be identified, as well, so that way the American people know what they\u2019re in for and they know what\u2019s actually going on with the bottom line when it comes to spending in Washington.\u201d\n\nRegarding Washington:\n\n\u201cMy priority when elected to go to Washington would be to be an advocate for the people of the state of Kansas,\u201d said Taylor. \u201cI believe that the senator is spending a substantial amount of time engaging in party rancor, which is part of the reason we\u2019re in the situation that we\u2019re in today and the reason Congress\u2019 approval rating is as low as it is.\u201d\n\nTaylor says, if elected, he would clearly identify Kansans\u2019 priorities.\n\n\u201cJob creation, being fiscally conservative, getting federal spending under control, utilizing that platform to get involved, and be that advocate the people of our state deserve,\u201d explained Taylor.\n\nRegarding Obamacare:\n\n\u201cI think that if you look at the basic premise of the Affordable Care Act, there are components of it, the way it was rolled out, the way it was promulgated that have created some problems,\u201d said Taylor. \u201cThe United States Supreme Court, the Speaker of the House John Boehner, said it\u2019s the law of the land.\u201d\n\nTaylor argues that we need to \u201cmove forward.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe need to get the right people in the room around the table to be able to determine what needs to be fixed and what needs to be tweaked in order to make it more economically efficient and helping lower the taxpayer burden, while still providing that high level of care for our citizens,\u201d said Taylor.\n\n\u201cI have no problem reaching across the aisle and working with people regardless of their political party,\u201d said Taylor.\n\n\u201cAs district attorney, I\u2019ve had to do that in working with Republican sheriffs, Republican police chiefs, and I can tell you that sitting down, knowing people, building relationships with them and trying to do the right thing for the right reason, doesn\u2019t have a party label attached to it\u2026 and I believe all those party labels are doing is dividing our country,\u201d continued Taylor.\n\nRegarding Immigration:\n\n\u201cThe immigration issue has been one that Congress has put off and put off for at least the last 15 years,\u201d said Taylor. \u201cAs district attorney, it\u2019s extremely frustrating not having a clear immigration policy on how to handle people illegally in the country.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have to sit down and determine what our priorities are, and once that\u2019s been done, promulgate legislation that is easy to understand and takes the burden or the level of bureaucracy built into the immigration process and lessens that so we stop incentivizing people to immigrate illegally because of the bureaucracy that we have that\u2019s what we\u2019re incentivizing, so I think that\u2019s the strongest fix that we can put forward,\u201d continued Taylor.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Democratic challenger in the race for U.S. Senator from
