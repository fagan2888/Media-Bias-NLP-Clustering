Centene operates local health plans and offers a range of health insurance solutions. It also contracts with other healthcare and commercial organizations to provide specialty services including behavioral health management, care management software, correctional healthcare services, dental benefits management, in-home health services, life and health management, managed vision, pharmacy benefits management, specialty pharmacy and telehealth services.\n\nCentene uses its investor relations website to publish important information about Centene, including information that may be deemed material to investors.

These forward-looking statements can be identified by the fact that they do not relate only to historical or current facts. Forward-looking statements often use words such as \"anticipate\", \"target\", \"expect\", \"estimate\", \"intend\", \"plan\", \"goal\", \"believe\", \"hope\", \"aim\", \"continue\", \"will\", \"may\", \"would\", \"could\" or \"should\" or other words of similar meaning or the negative thereof. There are several factors which could cause actual plans and results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in forward-looking statements. Such factors include, but are not limited to, the expected closing date of the transaction; the possibility that the expected synergies and value creation from the proposed merger will not be realized, or will not be realized within the expected time period, including, but not limited to, as a result of conditions, terms, obligations or restrictions imposed by regulators in connection with their approval of, or consent to, the merger; the risk that the businesses will not be integrated successfully; disruption from the merger making it more difficult to maintain business and operational relationships; the risk that unexpected costs will be incurred; changes in economic conditions or political conditions; changes in federal or state laws or regulations, including the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care Education Affordability Reconciliation Act and any regulations enacted thereunder; provider and state contract changes; the outcome of pending legal or regulatory proceedings; reduction in provider payments by governmental payors; the expiration or termination of Centene's or Health Net's Medicare or Medicaid managed care contracts with federal or state governments; tax matters; increased health care costs; the possibility that the merger does not close, including, but not limited to, due to the failure to satisfy the closing conditions; and risks and uncertainties discussed in the reports that Centene and Health Net have filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\"). These forward-looking statements reflect Centene's and Health Net's current views with respect to future events and are based on numerous assumptions and assessments made by Centene and Health Net in light of their experience and perception of historical trends, current conditions, business strategies, operating environments, future developments and other factors they believe appropriate. By their nature, forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties because they relate to events and depend on circumstances that will occur in the future. The factors described in the context of such forward-looking statements in this announcement could cause Centene's and Health Net's plans with respect to the proposed merger, actual results, performance or achievements, industry results and developments to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by such forward-looking statements. Although it is believed that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable, no assurance can be given that such expectations will prove to have been correct and persons reading this announcement are therefore cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements which speak only as of the date of this announcement. Neither Centene nor Health Net assumes any obligation to update the information contained in this announcement (whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise), except as required by applicable law. These risks, as well as other risks associated with the merger, are more fully discussed in the joint proxy statement/prospectus that is included in the Registration Statement on Form S-4 that has been filed with the SEC on September 21, 2015, in connection with the merger. A further list and description of risks and uncertainties can be found in Centene's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, and in its reports on Form 10-Q and Form 8-K as well as in Health Net's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015.\n\nTo view the original version on PR Newswire, visit:http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/centene-and-health-net-receive-cdi-regulatory-approval-300240067.html\n\nSOURCE Centene Corporation; Health Net, Inc.\n\nRelated Links\n\nhttp://www.centene.com\n\n", "article_metadata": {"geo.region": "california, missouri", "cf_entity_thumbnail_url": "http://content.prnewswire.com/designimages/logo-prn-01_PRN.gif", "geo.placename": "ST.
