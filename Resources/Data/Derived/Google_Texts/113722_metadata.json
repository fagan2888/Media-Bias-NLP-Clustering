Nurses can feel threatened or uncertain about the future of their facility, its identity and their job security when another hospital or organization takes over or consolidates with theirs. However, there also is much to be gained when a facility is bought or merges with another.\n\nIn 2012, 94 hospital/healthcare system mergers and acquisitions took place, according the American Hospital Association\u0092s website. That was a slight increase from 92 in 2011. The trend will continue into 2014 because of the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, predicted researchers in a June 2013 article on the American Medical Association\u0092s news website.\n\nAs healthcare systems acquire stand-alone hospitals or link up with other systems, patients and the nursing profession stand to gain, say healthcare analysts. Several CNOs and staff nurses whose organizations have been involved in mergers and acquisitions agree.\n\nA stronger bottomline\n\nJoanne Reich, RN, MA, NEA-BC, CNO at Chilton Hospital in Pompton Plains, N.J. , said Chilton has been in the merger process with Atlantic Health System, a large not-for-profit healthcare system, since last year. She said the merger of her 260-bed community hospital with AHS\u0092s four hospitals benefits Chilton by solidifying access for their patients into a tertiary system of care. \u0093Chilton serves 33 communities over 250 square miles,\u0094 Reich said, \u0093so this is a tremendous extension of the service area.\u0094\n\nLikewise, when Mountainside Hospital in Montclair, N.J., became part of Hackensack University Medical Center in 2012, nurses could see the benefit of becoming part of a larger system, said Mountainside\u0092s vice president and CNO Bonnie Michaels, RN, MA, NEA-BC, FACHE.\n\nMichaels said Mountainside experienced a previous acquisition by another healthcare system in 2007 and many staff, herself included, found the results favorable and the process manageable and necessary. \u0093Nationally, due to the prolonged economic downturn and a decline in hospital admissions with uncompensated care on the increase, every healthcare facility is faced with healthcare challenges,\u0094 she said. \u0093Joint ventures between not-for-profit and for-profit facilities are emerging throughout the country. Being affiliated with a larger healthcare system provides for increased integration and greater operating efficiencies, while providing market share growth and a better position in approaching commercial payer contracting. A facility that has a strong financial base and positive margin provides security to all its employees.\u0094\n\nIncreased job security\n\nWhen a community hospital joins with a larger healthcare system in the same region, both the community and the employees can benefit. Patients have access to more services and specialized providers through the larger organization. With predicted growth in services and patient population, job security is increased.\n\nAnn Mueller, RN, a critical care coordinator at Mountainside, said nurses in the surgical ICU are looking forward to having more physicians associated with the hospital, which will help increase the unit\u0092s census. Her colleagues also are pleased with wider job opportunities, such as the potential to work in the open heart surgical program at Hackensack UMC.\n\nNurses at smaller or independent hospitals see mergers as a chance to access a clinical ladder or to advance their education. \u0093The educational opportunities are phenomenal [with the larger organization],\u0094 said Donna Kruse, RN, MSN, CCRN-CMC-CFC, a clinical educator at Advocate Sherman Hospital in Elgin, Ill., part of Advocate Health Care, a 12-hospital system in Illinois. \u0093Advocate Health Care has a large calendar of courses and review classes for certification exams. These can be costly to take on your own. We already have nurses who have started signing up because they\u0092re excited about this rich resource that\u0092s now available.\u0094\n\nAnother advantage for nurses is being associated with a Magnet hospital or a health system with a favorable reputation. Nurses at Mountainside experienced a surge in public perception when the Hackensack UMC name was attached to their facility. \u0093To have that alliance [with Hackensack]made everyone feel good,\u0094 Mueller said. \u0093Joining with a great medical center boosted us in the eyes of the community.\u0094\n\nWhile some expanded healthcare networks offer cross-training for nurses to work among their facilities, that potential depends on the distance between sites and the physical continuity between settings. Michaels said one hospital in their new affiliation might offer cross-training, but the hurdle of a different system for documentation must be faced first. \u0093Eventually, when those of us at the older hospital get the new documentation systems, it will be easier to share with staff,\u0094 she said.\n\nBesides sharing everything from payroll systems and benefits to technology, the facilities must agree on shared cultures and values. \u0093Advocate and Sherman cultures are very similar, so the transition has been very transparent,\u0094 said Susan Campbell, RN, DNP, senior vice president and CNO for Advocate. Campbell said having similar cultures is key to a smooth transition. Both organizations must provide opportunities for nurses to learn the other\u0092s culture.\n\nOvercoming fear of change\n\n\u0093There is a natural tendency to respond to a [merger]announcement with fear of loss of identity and security, fear of giving up known relationships and expectations and the fear of losing what is familiar,\u0094 Michaels said.\n\nReich advises nurses to appreciate the change as a benefit for the hospital which ultimately will be a benefit for the community it serves. \u0093As a nurse, work to understand that your services become even more valuable as the emphasis is on quality care,\u0094 she said. \u0093Keeping current about change theory is an excellent way to keep yourself mentally prepared for our rapidly changing healthcare landscape.\u0094\n\nThe myriad concerns nurses have about job security and potential changes after a merger can be allayed by nursing leaders who communicate openly and transparently, Reich said. Fear of losing seniority or benefits, or being forced into undesired changes, can be diminished if nurse leaders share changes in advance. In many instances, as Michaels said, \u0093being affiliated with large healthcare system provides for growth and a strong financial base for all employees.\u0094\n\nWhile change is inevitable, nursing leaders such as Michaels and Reich, invite dialogue with their staffs and offer the following suggestions for easing growing pains:\n\n* Don\u0092t let the fear of the unknown overtake you.\n\n* Rather than dwell on rumors, find out the facts. Seek accurate information from leadership.\n\n* Attend open forums and meetings.\n\n*Anticipate and grow with the change that comes from a merger, whether the change is to schedules, dress code or job titles.\n\n* Watch for opportunities to get involved in the process.\n\n\u0093Nursing care at the bedside is still essential,\u0094 Michaels said. \u0093As best practices are implemented, changes will benefit patient care and nurses.\u0094\n\nReich concluded, \u0093Support each other, and see the strength in working collaboratively.\u0094", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Nurse.com News", "description": "Many nurses are facing a whole new set of challenges with the growing number of hospital mergers and acquisitions.
