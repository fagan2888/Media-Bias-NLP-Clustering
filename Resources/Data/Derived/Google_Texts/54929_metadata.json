He did the same last week in the Senate\u2019s rhetorical knife fight. God willing, John will bear witness to the conference committee that works out the differences between what House Democrats want and the wishes of the Republican majority in the Senate, then each chamber votes on a compromise before the session ends on May 6.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how they are going to do it,\u201d venerable Sen. Kent Lambert told John in his story today in the Post.\n\nWhen you punch the clock \u2014 OK, show up \u2014 at the statehouse, the scrape over the public\u2019s money is even more interesting to read when the people offering takes on it are unbiased professionals you know and respect. It\u2019s also a lot less work to just write a blog about it the next day. (Hey, cut me some slack, I\u2019m writing this at 6 a.m. in my Alabama Crimson Tide jammies.)\n\nPeter Marcus of the Durango Herald told us how the House passed a budget amendment that puts $1 million worth of incentives into the courtship of Colorado and Hollywood. Perhaps if there\u2019s another installment of \u201cTrue Grit\u201d filmmakers will come back to where the franchise started.\n\nAnd there\u2019s this reportorial gold from Pete and the Herald:\n\nRep. Don Coram, R-Montrose, continued his quest to secure funding for birth control, with an amendment that would add $5 million to the Family Planning Program, administered by the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment. The Democratic-controlled House advanced the amendment. Coram also has proposed a separate bill that would add $5 million to a program that provides the intrauterine devices, or IUDs, to low-income young women, in an effort to extend the program that has resulted in a 40 percent drop in teen pregnancies. But that bill faces a loss in the Republican-controlled Senate. Even though the IUD funding passed in the budget, it could be removed during continuing negotiations with the Senate in the days ahead. \u201cIt\u2019s more than 50 percent symbolic,\u201d Coram said. \u201cWe just got the word back (Tuesday) that Colorado is leading the nation in the lowest teen pregnancy rate. This is simply a way of putting it in.\u201d\n\nIvan Moreno of The Associated Press had the best take of the day on social media:\n\nHouse only has 39 amendments on the Colo. budget, limiting how long lawmakers will talk today to approximately 4,929 hours. #coleg \u2014 Ivan Moreno (@IvanJourno) April 8, 2015\n\nExpect good, thoughtful radio on the budget in the next few days from Megan Verlee of Colorado Public Radio and Bente Birkeland of KUNC and Rocky Mountain Community Radio.\n\nAnd it\u2019s always fun to see how the House Republican and Democratic press offices deliver the news in press releases from their partisan perches.\n\nLet\u2019s go first to the GOP:\n\nDemocrats vote unanimously against more education and transportation funding Denver \u2013 Tonight, Democrats voted unanimously against Republican led efforts to direct available general fund to education and transportation. The votes came on amendments offered by House Minority Leader Brian DelGrosso (R-Loveland) and Representative Terri Carver (R-Colorado Springs) to the state budget bill, SB 234. House Minority Leader Brian DelGrosso\u2019s amendment would have directed $15 million in available general fund to the Department of Education. \u201cColorado\u2019s general fund revenue has grown by more than 43% or $2.8 billion dollars since 2009, yet Democrats are not willing take money away from their own pet projects to boost funding for education,\u201d said DelGrosso. \u201cEvery superintendent across the state has said the recessionary cuts are still greatly impacting school districts and I am frustrated House Democrats refuse to hear their concerns.\u201d Representative Terri Carver\u2019s amendment would have directed $15 million in available general fund to the Department of Transportation. \u201cColorado\u2019s roads and bridges are in a state of disrepair and yet House Democrats are unwilling to make transportation a funding priority,\u201d said Carver. \u201cWith our roads in poor shape, we should be focusing our available resources on our core functions of government such as our roads and bridges, not new programs.\u201d All Republicans, excluding Representative Bob Rankin, who as a member of the Joint Budget Committee customarily votes against all amendments to the budget, supported both amendments.\n\nThe Democrats called it a short day at 7 hours of debate, though most of the morning the Republicans and Democrats divided into their caucuses to lay out their priorities and strategies on top of the floor debate. Nobody got off easy, except Lynn and me. Despite an elbow here and there, the left gave the right credit where credit was due, which is refreshing three months into the session.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Beth McCann,Bob Rankin,Clarice Navarro,Colorado House Democrats,Colorado House Republicans,Crisanta Duran,Daneya Esgar,Dave Young,Dickey Lee Hullinghorst,Dominick Moreno,Don Coram,Durango Herald,film-making incentives,Ivan Moreno,Joann Ginal,John Frank,KC Becker,Kent Lambert,Kevin Priola,Lois Landgraf,Millie Hamner,Paul Rosenthal,Peter Marcus,Rhonda Fields,Susan Lontine,Tim Dore,Tracy Kraft-Tharp", "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "og": {"site_name": "The Spot", "description": "After seven hours of debate on Colorado's $25 billion budget Wednesday, reporters sum it up before Democratic House and GOP Senate work out final plan.", "title": "Press bears witness to budget knife fight", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/thespot/2015/04/09/scribes-keep-tabs-on-the-publics-money-in-state-budget-knife-fight/118719/", "image": "http://local.denverpost.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/1200x627/denverpost.png?v=21060130", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "After seven hours of debate on Colorado's $25 billion budget Wednesday, reporters sum it up before Democratic House and GOP Senate work out final plan.", "title": "Scribes keep tabs on the public\u2019s money in state budget knife fight", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/thespot/2015/04/09/scribes-keep-tabs-on-the-publics-money-in-state-budget-knife-fight/118719/", "image": "http://local.denverpost.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/1200x627/denverpost.png?v=21060130", "creator": "@joeybunch", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "language": "en, sv", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "After seven hours of debate on Colorado's $25 billion budget Wednesday, reporters sum it up before Democratic House and GOP Senate work out final plan."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc971f\"", "article_summary": "Our generous Denver Post colleague in the statehouse, John Frank, did Lynn Bartels and me a tremendous solid and spent the day yesterday covering the spectacle that is a state budget debate.\nThe votes came on amendments offered by House Minority Leader Brian DelGrosso (R-Loveland) and Representative Terri Carver (R-Colorado Springs) to the state budget bill, SB 234.\nHouse Minority Leader Brian DelGrosso\u2019s amendment would have directed $15 million in available general fund to the Department of Education.\nPeter Marcus of the Durango Herald told us how the House passed a budget amendment that puts $1 million worth of incentives into the courtship of Colorado and Hollywood.\nAnd it\u2019s always fun to see how the House Republican and Democratic press offices deliver the news in press releases from their partisan perches."}
