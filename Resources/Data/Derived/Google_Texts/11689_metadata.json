Compared to the $2,000 penalty?\n\n\"You're going to save a lot of money,\" Sutton says.\n\nAnd that's not all. Sutton adds, \"The Obama Administration has postponed the employer mandate penalty until 2015.\"\n\nThat means, if a company cuts its health insurance now, they have a whole year without both the insurance payments to make or the penalties to pay.\n\nHowever, the good news for a company's bottom line may mean more frustration for its workers.\n\n\"I'd be really concerned,\" Sutton says. \"In Ohio, we did not sign-on to create these exchanges at the state level.\"\n\nThe new healthcare law, which went into effect October 1, has been a disaster for the Obama Administration because people who want to use the federal exchange have not been able to register online because of problems with the website, HealthCare.gov .\n\n\"So you're going to be one of those millions that's trying to get into the federal website,\" Sutton says.\n\nThe law only affects companies with over 50 employees.\n\nIf the move works for PSC, Sutton says expect other companies to do the same.\n\n\"If this one company can get real savings and show it with low costs in the market, then other companies will follow in order to be competitive.\"", "article_metadata": {"isStory": "true", "isPremium": "false", "description": "Metals company may get rid of health insurance coverage forcing employees to seek Obamacare", "author": "Michael Baldwin, newsnet5.com , Chris Horne, newsnet5.com", "og": {"site_name": "newsnet5", "description": "Metals company may get rid of health insurance coverage forcing employees to seek Obamacare", "title": "Mayfield Heights-based PSC Metals may dump company-paid health insurance, push workers to Obamacare", "url": "http://www.newsnet5.com/news/local-news/oh-cuyahoga/mayfield-heights-based-psc-metals-may-dump-company-paid-heath-insurance-push-employees-to-obamacare", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media2.newsnet5.com//photo/2013/11/20/Metals_Company_may_scrap_its_company_hea_1112160000_20131120232252_640_480.JPG", "height": 480}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"app": {"id": {"ipad": 481449100, "iphone": 487296004}}, "site": "@wews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "shortHeadline": "Local workers may be forced to Obamacare", "com.silverpop.brandeddomains": "www.pages03.net,scripps.mkt7057.com,www.newsnet5.com,recp.mkt32.net", "hasVideo": "true", "fb": {"app_id": 117981068372285}, "idio": {"hasVideo": "true", "isPremium": "false", "author": "Michael Baldwin, newsnet5.com , Chris Horne, newsnet5.com"}, "keywords": "local news, cuyahoga county, Mayfield Heights, PSC Metals, company-paid heath insurace, push employees, Obamacare, HealthCare.gov, Affordable Care Act, employer mandate", "google-site-verification": "DiabNvdHVXRDa2QCnoOOtjKaIvq8CtH1446fPeFerd0", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/WEWS5", "section": "OH Cuyahoga", "tag": "cuyahoga, obamacare", "published_time": "2013-11-21T11:32:12+0000", "modified_time": "2013-11-21T11:47:22+0000"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, target-densitydpi=device-dpi, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9d65\"", "article_summary": "MAYFIELD HEIGHTS, Ohio - Workers for a Mayfield Heights-based company may soon find themselves without health insurance, forcing them to turn to Obamacare.\nThat's because PSC Metals plans to drop its health coverage for employees, online trade publication American Metals Markets reports .\nIf PSC drops its health insurance, the company would face a penalty of $2000 per employee under the Affordable Care Act.\nThat means, if a company cuts its health insurance now, they have a whole year without both the insurance payments to make or the penalties to pay.\nIf the move works for PSC, Sutton says expect other companies to do the same."}
