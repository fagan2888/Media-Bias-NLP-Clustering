The group spoke at the library earlier this month and will return to Oxnard for a re-enactment in June. RICHARD QUINN/SPECIAL TO THE STAR Historical items and reproductions of items carried by soldiers in the Westward Expansion are displayed during an event at the Oxnard Public Library, during which members of the Buffalo Soldier Mounted Cavalry Unit spoke. RICHARD QUINN/SPECIAL TO THE STAR Joe Lawrence, of the Buffalo Soldier Mounted Cavalry Unit, smiles as he listens to speakers from the group at the Oxnard Public Library earlier this month. RICHARD QUINN/SPECIAL TO THE STAR Jonathan Collins (from left), Justin Collins and Art Dyson, of the Buffalo Soldier Mounted Cavalry Unit, listen to speakers from their group at the Oxnard Public Library earlier this month.\n\nBy Mark Storer\n\nJonathan Collins and his brother Justin are following in their father Jay\u2019s footsteps \u2014 but not as veterans after 25 years with the Los Angeles Police Department, which Jay is, nor as a sergeant with the Los Angeles International Airport Police Department, which he also is.\n\nAlong with their father, the Collins brothers are historical re-enactors with the Buffalo Soldier Mounted Cavalry Unit, based in Los Angeles. They\u2019ll be at Plaza Park in Oxnard on June 20 with a full camp re-enactment featuring tents, supplies, saddles, tack and food.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really living history,\u201d Jonathan said as he prepared for a presentation earlier this month before about 50 people at the Oxnard Public Library. \u201cWhen I was a kid, I don\u2019t think I was interested in anything like this. But now that I\u2019m older and having watched my dad, I really feel an obligation and a sense of why it\u2019s necessary to do it.\u201d\n\nThe Buffalo Soldiers were established by Congress in 1866 as the first peacetime all-black regiments in the regular U.S. Army. Tribes of Comanche and Kiowa Indians in the Southwest gave them their name because, they said, their hair was like buffalo hair. It was meant as a compliment, and the name stuck.\n\nThe whole Collins family, of Rowland Heights, is involved with the re-enactments. Jay\u2019s wife, Deborah, is part of the Women of the West, a group that travels with the Buffalo Soldiers and whose members dress in period outfits with flowing dresses, parasols, kerchiefs and gloves.\n\nDeborah said she too felt an obligation to share the history.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to tell this history so we can inform our youth,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s helped instill in us the importance of our past and we have to do that so that we can be guided toward our future.\u201d\n\nThe group\u2019s presentation began with a 45-minute film on the origins of the Buffalo Soldiers. Out of 10 cavalry regiments in the United States, two of them, the 9th and 10th Cavalry, were entirely African-American with white officers. One in five mounted cavalry soldiers was African-American in that time.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t just African-American history,\u201d said Amanda Dyson, one of the re-enactors from Women of the West. \u201cThis is American history. You can\u2019t know where you\u2019re going if you don\u2019t know your past. This is a way we move forward with a rich history and knowledge of who we were.\u201d\n\nJay Collins, dressed in his cavalry blue coat, pants and hat, said that he used to see the Buffalo Soldier re-enactors at the Rose Parade each year, and he knew early on he wanted to be one.\n\n\u201cI thought it was the best thing going, and I had a friend who was a member of the unit,\u201d Jay said. \u201cBelieve it or not, one of the guys in the unit bought me a horse after I joined, and I had already built a ranch house out in the country to prepare for it.\u201d\n\nCollins owns a six-acre ranch in Three Rivers, just outside Sequoia National Park. His ranch sits a few hundred yards from where the 9th Cavalry had its summer supply camp. One of the many duties the African-American units performed was protection of the National Parks from poachers and criminals.\n\nAfter the Spanish-American War, where the units fought with distinction, many were stationed in the west.\n\n\u201cAt a time when the west in America was virtually wild, these men had something to prove,\u201d said Collins. \u201cThey were discriminated against because of the color of their skin. Many of them were ex-slaves, and yet they were in a very dangerous part of the world protecting people who didn\u2019t always accept them.\u201d\n\nLeroy Gibson of Oxnard helped bring the group to the library.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d seen them at the Santa Barbara Fiesta parade where they rode down State Street carrying the American flag. I got a chance to meet them and invited them to come here,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I was a kid, I learned that my heroes, Tarzan and Superman, weren\u2019t real. But these are my real heroes. These are people who helped change the world.\u201d\n\nFor more information visit the website: http://www.bsmcu.com/", "article_metadata": {"title": "Buffalo Soldiers plan a return to Oxnard", "og": {"url": "http://www.vcstar.com/news/local/oxnard/buffalo-soldiers-plan-a-return-to-oxnard-ep-1095603063-343911302.html", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.jrn.com/images/buffalosoldiers02_18714610_ver1.0_640_480.jpg", "height": 436}, "type": "article", "description": "After speaking at the Oxnard Public Library earlier this month, Buffalo Soldier re-enactors plan a return trip in June.", "title": "Buffalo Soldiers plan a return to Oxnard"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.jrn.com/images/buffalosoldiers02_18714610_ver1.0_640_480.jpg", "description": "After speaking at the Oxnard Public Library earlier this month, Buffalo Soldier re-enactors plan a return trip in June.", "site": "https://twitter.com/vcstar", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Buffalo Soldiers plan a return to Oxnard"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://media.jrn.com/designimages/logo-vcs-icon-144.png", "__sync_contentCategory": "premium", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe16c2\"", "article_summary": "Along with their father, the Collins brothers are historical re-enactors with the Buffalo Soldier Mounted Cavalry Unit, based in Los Angeles.\n\u201cIt\u2019s really living history,\u201d Jonathan said as he prepared for a presentation earlier this month before about 50 people at the Oxnard Public Library.\n<p>RICHARD QUINN/SPECIAL TO THE STAR</p><p>Justin Collins, of the Buffalo Soldier Mounted Cavalry Unit, talks about weaponry used by the soldiers during the Westward Expansion, including the saber.\nRICHARD QUINN/SPECIAL TO THE STAR Joe Lawrence, of the Buffalo Soldier Mounted Cavalry Unit, smiles as he listens to speakers from the group at the Oxnard Public Library earlier this month.\nOne in five mounted cavalry soldiers was African-American in that time."}
