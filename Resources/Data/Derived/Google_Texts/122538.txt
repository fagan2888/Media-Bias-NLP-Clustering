Ã— Deadline approaches for Get Covered Illinois signup

CHICAGO (AP) _ Get Covered Illinois is urging Illinois residents to enroll for health insurance before the Feb. 15 deadline.

Health insurance marketplace officials say those who fail to sign up by the deadline could face a fine of $325 or more.

More than 800,000 Illinois residents have signed up for insurance coverage since it became available through Get Covered Illinois.

Nearly everyone is required to have health insurance. The fines have increased for failing to get coverage before the deadline.

Residents without an insurance plan by the deadline might pay $325 or two percent of their income on the 2015 taxes.

A free health fair is scheduled for Saturday in Chicago.
