The majority will hit the streets penniless, and often in poor health. For them, immediate access to low-cost or free health care would be a big help.\n\nSo, now that federal health reforms have made most parolees eligible for Medi-Cal \u2014 California\u2019s version of Medicaid \u2014 prisons are doubling their efforts to enroll them.\n\nOn a recent visit to the California Medical Facility in Vacaville, a pair of counselors helped dozens of inmates fill out paperwork for Medi-Cal shortly before their scheduled release.\n\nRichard Kamka, 64, said he welcomed the help. Kamka has been locked up for nearly a decade after being convicted of making criminal threats, possessing illegal drugs and stalking. He will be paroled to Butte County this fall. Unless prison doctors remove his cataracts, Kamka said, he won\u2019t be able to work.\n\n\u201cI need to have my eyes so I can at least, you know, do something,\u201d he said.\n\nBefore the Affordable Care Act took effect, California\u2019s Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (CDCR) could enroll only about 15 to 20 percent of parolees in Medi-Cal. That\u2019s because only low-income parents, pregnant mothers and disabled people used to qualify. Now anyone who earns less than $15,000 annually can sign up.\n\nThe department\u2019s Robert Storms estimates that 90 percent of parolees will be eligible under the new criteria. Storms wants them to walk out of prison with a Medi-Cal card in hand \u2014 and a medical provider already selected.\n\n\u201cWhat this does is provides an opportunity for immediate access to care,\u201d Storms says.\n\nHaving Medi-Cal will allow parolees to enroll in programs to treat drug and alcohol addiction \u2014 something 75 percent of them struggle with. They\u2019ll also be able to get preventative care and treat ongoing chronic conditions and serious illness. That\u2019s significant in California, where nearly a third of inmates have some kind of condition that requires ongoing medical care.\n\nStorms believes having access to treatment could reduce the risk that parolees will commit new crimes.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re becoming more responsible for their own health and achieving things that helps them become independent, productive and hopefully working towards a better life,\u201d Storms says.\n\nCDCR officials estimate that enrolling parolees in Medi-Cal will cut parole costs by millions of dollars a year. Prison officials shifted $2.4 million in projected savings from a budget for psychotropic medicines for parolees to nearly double the number of benefit counselors. But it\u2019s taken corrections longer to hire and train them than anticipated. One reason: They lost counselors when one of the counties providing that service quit the business.\n\nFor now, California prisons can screen only 40 percent of inmates for Medi-Cal. Corrections officials are working with counties and community groups to enroll the other 60 percent after they get out of prison. But there\u2019s consensus that waiting to do that is risky.\n\n\u201cIf they have the ability to go straight to a medical provider like us and be seen \u2014 it would be huge,\u201d says John Holman of Healthy Oakland. The nonprofit offers parolees low-cost medical and mental health treatment.\n\nHolman says former prisoners who apply for Medi-Cal when they get out wait months to get coverage. In the meantime, they still need care. Most of them take multiple drugs for chronic conditions like diabetes and hypertension. Many rely on medications to treat anxiety, depression and psychosis.\n\nHaving Medi-Cal will allow parolees to enroll in programs to treat drug and alcohol addiction \u2014 something 75 percent of them struggle with.\n\n\u201cIf someone has all these conditions and they see that they can\u2019t get any help, they know they can self-medicate,\u201d Holman says.\n\nOr they can turn to emergency rooms and rack up large bills they can\u2019t afford to pay. That\u2019s how 55-year-old Leonard Johnson dealt with it.\n\n\u201cWhen they let me out of prison I didn\u2019t have no medical for like seven months,\u201d Johnson says.\n\nHe served 17.5 years for assault and robbery. At Pleasant Valley State Prison he caught an airborne fungal infection called Valley Fever. But when Johnson paroled to Antioch over a year ago, he lacked medication for the disease and for his diabetes.\n\n\u201cI got real sick and went to the hospital,\u201d Johnson says.\n\nOne of the biggest challenges is signing up the 27 percent of parolees diagnosed with mental disorders.\n\nAt Telecare, a national mental health service provider that treats parolees in Southern California, Senior Vice President Faith Richie says it\u2019s hard to locate them after they get out of prison.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re coming out, and essentially the minute they hit the street, they\u2019re homeless \u2014 unless they have a family member or friend who will take them in,\u201d Richie says. \u201cThey don\u2019t have income. Once they\u2019ve burned through their gate money, they\u2019re in the wind.\u201d\n\nRichie says Telecare\u2019s staff helps patients enroll in Medi-Cal and will meet them under freeway bridges to do it. But tens of thousands of inmates paroled to other parts of the state each year won\u2019t get that kind of individual help.\n\nAt the California Medical Facility, inmate Richard Kamka says knowing that he can go to any Medi-Cal provider in his county when he gets out calms at least one of his fears about paroling.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a scary thing,\u201d Kamka says. \u201cI mean it\u2019s a happy thing, but then you\u2019re going out there, going, \u2018Hey where\u2019s my breakfast this morning?\u2019\u201d\n\nCDCR\u2019s Robert Storms says that by spring 2015, the department will be able to help all paroling inmates apply for Medi-Cal.\n\nFor now, California\u2019s prisons are focusing their Medi-Cal enrollment efforts on inmates with mental disorders, serious or chronic diseases and disabilities.", "article_metadata": {"description": "As a result of the ACA, more inmates will be able to get access to immediate care when they're out.", "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"Prisons Boost Efforts to Enroll Parolees In Medi-Cal\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/news\\/2014\\/06\\/10\\/prisons-boost-efforts-health-care-parolees\",\"pub_date\":\"2014-06-10 08:00:42\",\"mod_date\":\"2014-06-10 15:40:15\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":138599,\"author_id\":\"236\",\"author_name\":\"KQED News Staff\",\"author_display_name\":\"KQED News Staff\",\"tags\":[\"Medi-Cal for parolees\",\"prisons\"],\"categories\":[\"News\"],\"image\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/news\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/sites\\/10\\/2014\\/06\\/Parolee-Medi-cal-2-Kamka-richard-2.jpeg\"}", "og": {"site_name": "KQED News", "description": "As a result of the ACA, more inmates will be able to get access to immediate care when they're out.", "title": "Prisons Boost Efforts to Enroll Parolees In Medi-Cal", "url": "http://ww2.kqed.org/news/2014/06/10/prisons-boost-efforts-health-care-parolees/", "image": "http://ww2.kqed.org/news/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2014/06/Parolee-Medi-cal-2-Kamka-richard-2-640x480.jpeg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@kqednews", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@"}, "fb": {"app_id": 160023622793}, "keywords": "medi-cal for parolees,prisons", "google-site-verification": "Oam-TnlJjUP-cg8UEyR3-KcLp8_-WTy6_dBaSws1ADA", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf10e\"", "article_summary": "So, now that federal health reforms have made most parolees eligible for Medi-Cal \u2014 California\u2019s version of Medicaid \u2014 prisons are doubling their efforts to enroll them.\nHaving Medi-Cal will allow parolees to enroll in programs to treat drug and alcohol addiction \u2014 something 75 percent of them struggle with.\nFor now, California\u2019s prisons are focusing their Medi-Cal enrollment efforts on inmates with mental disorders, serious or chronic diseases and disabilities.\nStorms wants them to walk out of prison with a Medi-Cal card in hand \u2014 and a medical provider already selected.\nOn a recent visit to the California Medical Facility in Vacaville, a pair of counselors helped dozens of inmates fill out paperwork for Medi-Cal shortly before their scheduled release."}
