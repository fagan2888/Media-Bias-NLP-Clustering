Thank you for your Wednesday editorial, “John Kasich, the anti-Trump.”

Your editorial board seems to be as impressed with him as I was during the two Republican presidential debates.

The other candidates were tripping over themselves to assert their testosterone on the world stage. Even Carly Fiorina said that she would not talk to Russian President Vladimir Putin, but she would encircle his country with missiles and troops.

Kasich, on the other hand, gave calm, reasoned answers to foreign policy questions. While he said that he was not totally pleased with the current treaty with Iran, he admitted that it represented a multinational approach to world problems, a fact that was too wonderful to ignore.

When discussing the expansion of Medicaid under Obamacare, the other candidates tried to out do each other’s disdain for poor and low-income people without offering alternative health care plans. Again Kasich pointed out the logic that preventive health care for all helps all state budgets down the road.

If the Republican Party wants to be taken seriously, it has to support serious, moderate, compromising politicians.

This is the only way to get legislation passed in Congress and the only way to gain respect for the presidency on the world stage.
