While efforts by his family to make changes to the road and the speed have been unsuccessful, Saturday his community reminded his family that he's not been forgotten.\n\nBike clubs from all over Bay County ended a poker run at the American Legion Post 392 in downtown Panama City. Bikers, friends and family of Dylan Corbin paused the live music, the food and silent auction to watch the Deane Bozeman JROTC perform a flag ceremony. They then presented his parents, Staci and Chris Corbin with the flag.\n\n\"We were not expecting the flag. The flag ceremony was awesome,\" Staci Corbin said, holding the flag to her chest.\n\nThe clubs, from different beliefs, behaviors and bikes, spent the day rallying for Dylan, for his friends and for more than his parents ever expected.\n\n\"We're very humbled,\" the Corbins said.\n\nThe money from the run, totaling more than $5,000, will go to a scholarship fund in Dylan's name. The scholarship will be given to a Deane Bozeman senior in the JROTC group.\n\nWhile the brothers in bikes and the brothers in arms wear different patches, they say it's not their affiliations that stitch them together.\n\n\"Refreshing to see the community coming together and supporting a just cause and something that may turn into a great benefit for the future,\" Hector Rivera, JROTC instructor said.\n\nRivera said he was very proud to see his students in the young program perform.\n\n\"It was very cool that we got to experience this for him,\" Victoria Barwick said of Dylan. The Deane Bozeman JROTC sophomore said she and her peers were nervous to perform the flag ceremony because they wanted to make sure they did it right for the family.\n\n\"It's just been so wonderful for so many of the community to come together and are still honoring Dylan and his memory,\" his parents said. \"We're very proud of the man our son was.\"", "article_metadata": {"description": "In October, Deane Bozeman School graduate Dylan Corbin died in a motorcycle accident.
