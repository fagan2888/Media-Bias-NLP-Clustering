Thousands of Republicans didn\u2019t get to vote. And 1 million unaffiliated voters sat on the sidelines.\u201d\n\nUnfortunately, it appears Colorado\u2019s role in this presidential-nomination cycle will be remembered more for how participation was limited than for how our purple state helped influence the national discussion by involving as many voters as possible.\n\nLet\u2019s be clear: There was nothing sinister or underhanded about either party\u2019s process. The reality is that we have simply outgrown the caucus system when it comes to the nominating process for presidential candidates.\n\nColorado can, and will, do better. Restoring a presidential primary and opening all primaries to independent voters are sensible steps toward that end.\n\nCurrently, participation in the primary phase is limited solely to party members. We\u2019ve seen the results of that firsthand this caucus season, but we\u2019ve also seen a decline in participation in our primaries in recent years.\n\nA group called Let Colorado Vote is pursuing ballot initiatives that would restore the presidential primary in Colorado in 2020 and, before then, would open primary elections to the state\u2019s 1 million independent \u2014 or \u201cunaffiliated,\u201d in election parlance \u2014 voters. Their proposals call for a semi-open primary, meaning unaffiliated voters could vote in either the Democratic or Republican primary, but not both.\n\nIn recent years, Colorado voters have been almost evenly divided between Republicans, Democrats and independents, with each comprising about a third of the electorate. More recent voter registration data paint a picture of how that is changing. Independent voters now account for 37 percent of registered voters, with Republicans and Democrats each tallying 31 percent.\n\nIn fact, Colorado leads the nation in the growth of unaffiliated voters since 2008, and young people are leading the way. Two-thirds of newly registered voters chose not to join a party in 2014, and nearly half of the voters age 40 and under in Colorado are unaffiliated.\n\nAs affiliated partisans, we support our parties and will continue working to involve voters in our organizations. But that doesn\u2019t preclude us from supporting the work of Let Colorado Vote, which aims to increase voter participation in a critical phase of our democratic process.\n\nIn coming days, a bill that would restore a presidential primary (they were held Colorado in 1992, 1996 and in 2000, before being canceled for budgetary reasons after the dot.com bubble burst) is expected to be introduced in the state legislature. The heads of both parties have said they support the idea. A similar bill was introduced last year but was scuttled, in part, because of concerns about the cost.\n\nGiven the choice between what we witnessed this year and a presidential primary that draws more attention from candidates and higher participation from Colorado voters, we would surely argue that it would have been money well spent, even when lawmakers grapple with other pressing needs. We would also argue that when taxpayer money is used to pay for an election, that election should be open to all voters who wish to make their voices heard.\n\nTo be more succinct: If the legislature acts to restore a presidential primary, we encourage them to open that primary \u2014 and all primary elections \u2014 to independent voters.\n\nRegardless of your political persuasion, we hope that you, like us, will agree that Colorado should be encouraging voter engagement, and pursuing policies that open our primary elections to all registered voters who want to participate.\n\nBill Ritter Jr. was Colorado\u2019s 41st governor.
