Former President Bill Clinton on Sunday cautioned against underestimating the current GOP presidential field and said he believes that power brokers within the party ultimately will settle on one candidate they believe has the best chance to win.

Appearing on CNN’s “State of the Union,” the former president and husband of Democratic presidential frontrunner Hillary Rodham Clinton said the Republican 2016 hopefuls have a lot going for them.

“They’ve got a lot of youth, they’ve got a lot of energy, they’ve got some significant diversity and they’re no dummies. And they believe what they believe. They still believe trickle-down economics works better than investment. And their convictions are so great they’re undeterred by evidence and that’s always amazing to me,” Mr. Clinton said.

“At some point during this process, whatever they’re debating, whatever the stories are, there will be a move by people who think they can influence the process to settle on the one who they think is most electable.”
