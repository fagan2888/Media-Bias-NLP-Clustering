More “Masters of Sex” and “Ray Donovan” are on the way.

Showtime has renewed both summer series for third seasons, with 12 episodes scheduled for 2015. Both are currently in the middle of their second seasons. Of the two, the 1950s period piece “Masters of Sex” has been a favorite of critics, with Lizzy Caplan’s portrayal of Virginia Johnson receiving an Emmy nomination for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama; Allison Janney has already won the Emmy for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Drama Series. Earlier this year, the series was nominated for a Golden Globe for Best Drama Series, with star Michael Sheen receiving a nomination for Best Drama Actor.

“Ray Donovan,” which stars Liev Schreiber as the titular character who’s a Hollywood “fixer,” has earned praise for Jon Voight’s performance as Mickey Donovan, Ray’s father. Voight is up for the Outstanding Supporting Actor Emmy and won the Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actor earlier this year.

As Entertainment Weekly notes, “Ray Donovan” averages around five million viewers once all forms of watching are accounted for with “Masters of Sex” close behind, averaging four million.
