It is so under resourced.\"\n\n\"A lot of these people need work -- not teeth cleaning, but major reconstruction,\" Pate said.\n\nDave Nader, a volunteer with Get Covered America who was at Zion Hill, said many people \"are afraid of the cost. They don't know that eight in 10 or nine in 10 are eligible for some sort of subsidy.\"\n\nPate said the government enrollment website appears to be working well this time, in contrast to when the so-called Obamacare struggled to get off the ground earlier in the year.\n\nA woman who identified herself only as Sandy was shopping for options at the Hough Health Center on Hough Avenue, part of the Northeast Ohio Neighborhood Health Care Services (NEON) network.\n\n\"I just wanted to look today,\" she said. \"I need to do a lot more research.\"\n\nLisa Harris, one of three outreach-enrollment specialists at the Hough center, said she had only seen two people by noon.\n\nShe expected a trickle of walk-ins \"because this is the first day and people know they have time.\"\n\nInquiries and enrollments will grow exponentially the closer it gets to the February 15 deadline, Harris predicted.\n\nToward the end of the previous enrollment period, she said on one day \"I had 42 messages on my phone.\"\n\nHarris said the main concern people have is the affordability of the insurance plans.\n\nBut Harris said, \"Some make a little too much for Medicaid, but they are still categorized as low-income,\" so eligible for subsidies.\n\nMore than 8 million people bought private insurance policies during the first open enrollment period.\n\nThe Obama administration has set a goal of getting over 9 million people enrolled this time.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "enrollment,obamacare", "title": "Obamacare enrollment off to a slow start in Cleveland", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Obamacare enrollment off to a slow start in Cleveland\", \"link\": \"http://www.cleveland.com/metro/index.ssf/2014/11/obamacare_enrollment_off_to_a.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://imgick.cleveland.com/home/cleve-media/width620/img/plain_dealer_metro/photo/16349269-standard.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"14504829\", \"pub_date\": \"2014-11-15T21:20:29Z\", \"author\": \"James Ewinger, The Plain Dealer\", \"tags\": [\"@mobile\",\"enrollment\",\"obamacare\"] }", "twitter": {"image": "http://media.cleveland.com/plain_dealer_metro/photo/16349269-thumb_square_large.jpg", "creator": "@EwingerJ", "site": "@clevelanddotcom", "card": "summary", "description": "Affordable health-care enrollment is off to a slow start in Cleveland"}, "article_date_updated": "Saturday, November 15, 2014,  4:57 PM", "parsely-metadata": "{\"image_url\": \"http://media.cleveland.com/plain_dealer_metro/photo/enrolla-img-4687jpg-66eb05f03e1b23b0.jpg\", \"author_name\": \"jewinger\", \"author_nickname\": \"James Ewinger, The Plain Dealer\", \"author_id\": \"5798\", \"source_blog_name\": \"Metro News\", \"source_blog_url\": \"http://www.cleveland.com/metro/index.ssf/\", \"sponsored_content\": \"0\" }", "og": {"site_name": "cleveland.com", "description": "Affordable health-care enrollment is off to a slow start in Cleveland", "title": "Obamacare enrollment off to a slow start in Cleveland", "url": "http://www.cleveland.com/metro/index.ssf/2014/11/obamacare_enrollment_off_to_a.html", "image": "http://media.cleveland.com/design/alpha/img/logo_cleve.gif", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "cleveland.com", "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Saturday, November 15, 2014,  4:21 PM", "article_author": "James Ewinger, The Plain Dealer", "Description": "Affordable health-care enrollment is off to a slow start in Cleveland"}, "article_summary": "CLEVELAND, Ohio -- The second open-enrollment period to sign up for health insurance on the federal exchange got off to a slow start today.\nToward the end of the previous enrollment period, she said on one day \"I had 42 messages on my phone.\"\nMore than 8 million people bought private insurance policies during the first open enrollment period.\nA woman who identified herself only as Sandy was shopping for options at the Hough Health Center on Hough Avenue, part of the Northeast Ohio Neighborhood Health Care Services (NEON) network.\nTraffic was light this morning but expected to grow at Greater Cleveland locations that had insurance advisers on site."}
