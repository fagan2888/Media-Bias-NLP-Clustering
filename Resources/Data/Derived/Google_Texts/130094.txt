Ivanka Trump, daughter of Republican frontrunner Donald Trump, gave birth to her third child, a baby boy named Theodore James, on Sunday. She announced the birth on Twitter, and posted an adorable picture with herself and her newborn baby.

Baby Theodore. My heart is full. xx, Ivanka #grateful pic.twitter.com/aOux7Nm3BU — Ivanka Trump (@IvankaTrump) March 28, 2016

Some were quick to point out that Ivanka's choice of name for her son may be a bit humorous in light of her father's feud with Sen. Ted Cruz.

Theodore James is Donald Trump's eighth grandchild.

Congratulations, Ivanka and Jared! He's beautiful.
