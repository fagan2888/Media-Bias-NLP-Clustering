Roughly 6,400 Americans are diagnosed with the condition every year. Now, researchers from the University of North Carolina School of Medicine might be one step closer to finding a cure, as they\u2019ve discovered the clumps of toxic proteins responsible for its onset.\n\n\"One of the biggest puzzles in health care is how to address neurodegenerative diseases. Unlike many cancers and other conditions, we currently have no leverage against these neurodegenerative diseases,\" said the study\u2019s senior author Nikolay Dokholyan, a biochemistry professor at UNC, in a press release. \"This study is a big breakthrough because it sheds light on the origin of motor neuron death and could be very important for drug discovery.\"\n\nFor the study, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Dokholyan and her team focused on the genetic mutation of one particular protein known as SOD1. Researchers have known since the early 1990s the protein was unique to ALS because it killed neurons within the patients\u2019 brains. However, it was still unclear how the protein looked; researchers only knew ALS patients had this mutation.\n\nProctor and her team spent two years developing a way to trace brain damage in the brain caused by this mutation. Through a combination of algorithms and computer models, they were eventually able to identify SOD1\u2019s structure at the damaged sites within live cells. They found SOD1 formed into clumps of three proteins called \u201ctrimers,\u201d which are capable of killing motor neurons. In patients with ALS, this translates to gradual paralysis \u2014 not only with moving legs and arms, but also with speaking, swallowing, and breathing \u2014 and eventual death.\n\n\"This is a major step because nobody has known exactly what toxic interactions are behind the death of motor neurons in patients with ALS,\" said the study\u2019s lead researcher Elizabeth Proctor, a graduate student at UNC, in a press release. \"Knowing what these trimers look like, we can try to design drugs that would stop them from forming, or sequester them before they can do damage.\"\n\nProteins, when clumped into sets of three, are unstable within the body \u2014 hence why they\u2019re considered a mutation. Proctor believes this is the reason behind SOD1\u2019s toxicity inside the brain. The proteins interact with other neurons and wind up damaging them permanently, leading to ALS\u2019s characteristic degeneration.\n\nThe results may not only benefit those affected by ALS, however. Researchers believe they can also shed light on other neurodegenerative diseases and help patients who suffer from them. \"There are many similarities among neurodegenerative diseases,\" Dokholyan said. \"What we have found here seems to corroborate what is known about Alzheimer's already, and if we can figure out more about what is going on here, we could potentially open up a framework to be able to understand the roots of other neurodegenerative diseases.\"\n\nSource: Proctor E, Dokholyan N, Fee L, et al.
