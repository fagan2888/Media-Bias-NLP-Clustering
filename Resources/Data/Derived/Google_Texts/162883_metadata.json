Might be the night\u2019s must-see viewing. In a word: THUNDERSLEET.\n\nPlan accordingly. And if you don\u2019t believe the weather service, there\u2019s always this second opinion from Frankie McDonald. Be prepared. You know \u2014 charge your tablets, get out the flashlights, order your Chinese food, pick up yer Pepsis. Etc. Hard to argue with that.\n\nRemeisha Shade at KXAS-Channel 5 is forecasting the heaviest sleet before sunrise Monday, followed later in the evening by the chance of freezing drizzle, and says it likely won\u2019t get above freezing until Tuesday afternoon.\n\nUpdate at 4:21 p.m. Saturday by Julie Fancher: The National Weather Service has upgraded the Winter Storm Watch to a Winter Storm Warning from 6 p.m. Sunday to 6 p.m. Monday.\n\n\u201cThe warning means we are fairly confident this event is going to happen,\u201d said Steve Fano, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service office in Fort Worth.\n\nFano said it\u2019s likely this event will produce some sleet and freezing rain.\n\n\u201cWe are pretty certain this is going to produce some sleet and freezing rain, though sleet looks more likely now than it did yesterday,\u201d he said. \u201cThough either one creates hazardous driving conditions.\u201d\n\nUpdate at 3:15 p.m. Saturday: Yes, it\u2019s hard to fathom a winter storm on a Sunday when it\u2019s mostly clear and around 60 the Saturday before. But the National Weather Service remains confident that tomorrow evening, things will begin to get iffy on their way towards treacherous.\n\nFor now, at least, here\u2019s the latest timing, per meteorologist Jamie Gudmestad at the National Weather Service office in Fort Worth.\n\n\u201cThe front should be coming in tomorrow morning, starting as rain\u201d \u2014 around 7, 8 a.m., give or take.\n\n\u201cThen, as the cold front moves in, it will switch over to wintry mix by evening\u201d \u2014 around 6, 7 p.m., give or take.\n\nRight now \u2014 and that\u2019s right now, at 3:15 p.m. on Saturday \u2014 it looks like temperatures will hit freezing around midnight as they plunge into the mid- to upper 20s by Monday morning.\n\n\u201cBut that\u2019s at the surface,\u201d says Gudmestad. \u201cColder air aloft could bring some of the wintry precip earlier than the surface temperatures.\u201d\n\nThe heavier rain will come before the freezing temperatures \u2014 at least, that\u2019s according to the current modeling. But we\u2019re expected to see enough of the wintry stuff to cause problems \u2014 around 1/4 to 1/2 an inch by Monday morning, and \u201cwe\u2019ll be lucky to get above freezing\u201d Monday, Gudmestad says.\n\nAnd don\u201dt tell the kids just yet, but, she says, \u201cit\u2019s still looking like\u201d a school-closing kind of Monday..\n\nUpdate at 8:40 a.m. Saturday: While you slept, the National Weather Service expanded the Winter Storm Watch issued Friday afternoon. It now extends much further south of Dallas-Fort Worth \u2014 all the way to Waco and Corsicana. That, says the National Weather Service\u2019s Dan Shoemaker, is how confident the National Weather Service is in its ice-coated forecast.\n\nThe NWS has also moved up the timing of the winter storm\u2019s arrival.\n\nInitially, forecasters had sleet arriving in Dallas-Fort Worth just as Sunday turns into Monday. Now, Shoemaker says, most of its models show us dropping below freezing around sunset Sunday \u2014 just as a second batch of precipitation is moving into the area following a first round of plain ol\u2019 wet stuff scheduled to arrive during the day.\n\n\u201cThat second batch rolling in Sunday night, that\u2019s the one where we\u2019ll be cold enough to start as freezing rain,\u201d says Shoemaker. \u201cThen it\u2019ll change to sleet, and that change will happen pretty fast. We moved up the time because it\u2019ll be colder\u201d earlier than originally forecast.\n\nYou can see that now: The first cold front initially forecast to arrive Saturday afternoon slid through Dallas-Fort Worth around 6:30 this morning. Once-upon-a-forecasted highs in the 70s are long gone. We\u2019re in the low 50s and upper 40s across the area, and unlikely to warm much beyond that. There also won\u2019t be any rain today. That comes tomorrow in the afternoon.\n\nThen, the ice. How much? Half an inch, says Shoemaker \u2014 enough to create \u201chazardous travel Sunday night into Monday and Monday night into Tuesday, when whatever doesn\u2019t dry up during the day Monday refreezes.\u201d KXAS-Channel 5\u2032s Rick Mitchell says that \u201cany ice on the roads will likely last through Tuesday morning.\u201d\n\nThis is the first time we\u2019ve heard the words \u201cfreezing rain\u201d mentioned in the forecast \u2014 a whole different threat than sleet. Freezing rain brings down power lines. Sleet makes roads icy. Shoemaker says right now, at least, it doesn\u2019t look like a major concern \u2014 the freezing rain should quickly turn to sleet. But, of course, all winter-weather forecasts are fluid \u2026 until they freeze.\n\n\u201cRight when you go to freezing, a lot of the raindrops will melt as they fall and refreeze as freezing rain,\u201d he says. \u201cBut it should switch over to sleet pretty quickly. It\u2019ll all pack down into ice by Sunday night. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s four inches coming \u2014 this isn\u2019t like our cobblestone-ice event [of December 2013]. There\u2019s not same amount of moisture. But that doesn\u2019t negate the fact there will be a lot of problems with this. But we get a lot of problems when it rains during rush hour.\u201d\n\nAnd, yeah, you might as well prepare to keep the kids at home Monday. Nothing worse than an ice day too. But looks like that\u2019s pretty close to a sure thing.\n\n\u201cIf this forecast is good, and we have pretty good confidence that it is, I don\u2019t know why schools wouldn\u2019t close,\u201d Shoemaker says. \u201cThe roads will ice up Sunday evening. I would anticipate schools closing. This looks like that kind of event.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"liveFyreID": "aHR0cDovL3RoZXNjb29wYmxvZy5kYWxsYXNuZXdzLmNvbS8yMDE1LzAyL25hdGlvbmFsLXdlYXRoZXItc2VydmljZS13YXJucy1lYXJseS10aGF0LWZyZWV6aW5nLXJhaW4tYW5kLXNsZWV0LWFjY3VtdWxhdGlvbnMtcG9zc2libGUtd2l0aC1jb21pbmctZnJvbnQuaHRtbC8=", "generator": "WordPress 3.9.12", "author": "Robert Wilonsky", "og": {"site_name": "The Scoop Blog", "description": "Update at 9:04 p.m. Saturday by Robert Wilonsky: The National Weather Service has just released its video look-see at the coming winter storm.
