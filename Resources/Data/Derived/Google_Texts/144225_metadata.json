So let\u2019s review some recent tidbits, shall we?\n\nFirst the good news. Customers who enrolled in the most popular Obamacare plans for 2015 shouldn\u2019t expect to see major hikes in their out-of-pocket health expenses compared with 2014, according to a new analysis. But wait. Those individual and family plan customers will still have substantially greater deductibles than people with employer-provided plans \u2013 and more limited networks. So even for these customers, things are still terrible; it\u2019s just that they\u2019re not expected to get too terribly more terrible next year.\n\nSo we see that Obama\u2019s bait-and-switch continues. He wants you to believe that his law insures everyone. Even if that were remotely true, which it is not, of how much benefit is insurance coverage when you have to pay high deductibles before you even get to access it \u2013 and, adding insult to injury, still lose your doctors, your hospital and possibly your range of coverage?\n\nEnough with the \u201cgood news.\u201d Now for the not-so-wonderful news.\n\nLast week, a report was released showing the administration, in the words of CNBC, \u201cpulled a fast-one with enrollment numbers for Obamacare, boosting a tally by including up to 400,000 dental plans \u2013 without publicly disclosing that fact at the time.\u201d In September, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Administrator Marilyn Tavenner said there were 7.3 million \u201cAmericans enrolled in health insurance marketplace coverage,\u201d not disclosing that hundreds of thousands of dental plan numbers were included in that figure and that without them, the total would have been less than 7 million.\n\nDavid Limbaugh\u2019s brand new book applies a lawyer\u2019s skepticism to the Gospel of Christ and documents his own spiritual journey. Order \u201cJesus on Trial\u201d\n\nBut how did the administration react? As it always does, pretending to be surprised and outraged \u2013 as if it were not the primary player in this bad act. Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell jumped on Twitter within hours of this report and called the discrepancy \u201cunacceptable.\u201d She later promised to take action \u201cto ensure that this kind of mistake does not occur again.\u201d\n\nFool me once, shame on me. Fool me twice, three times, four times \u2026 50 times and I ought to be flogged for my ignorance and passivity. But there just may be a limit to the public\u2019s willful blind spot with Obama, as the November elections showed.\n\nBurwell knows this wasn\u2019t a mere mistake, and thank goodness House Oversight and Government Reform Committee Chairman Darrell Issa called her on it. \u201cAfter touting 8 million initial sign-ups for medical plans,\u201d said Issa, \u201cfour months later they engaged in a concerted effort to obscure a heavy drop-off rate of perhaps a million or more enrollees by quietly adding in dental sign-ups to exchange numbers. Faced with large numbers of Americans running for an exit from Obamacare, instead of offering the public an accurate accounting, the administration offered numbers that obscured and downplayed the number of dropouts. Now they\u2019re saying this was just a \u2018mistake.\u2019 The claim that this was only (accidental) stretches credulity.\u201d\n\nThat is exactly right. It does stretch credulity for the administration to pretend this was an innocent mistake. Like everything else from this bunch, it was a premeditated act of deceit, motivated by their desire to continue fooling the American people by minimizing how bad Obamacare is.\n\nThere\u2019s more. CNBC reports that though small-business owners may have avoided Obamacare\u2019s regulations and penalties in its first year, they\u2019ll not be able to do that in the second year and beyond. In a recent survey conducted by payroll processing firm ADP, small businesses indicated that health-care costs and complexities and the enormity of government regulations are their greatest concerns. One-third of business owners are fined annually for failing to comply with some sort of government regulation. Half of the companies paying fines don\u2019t even know the details of the fines they\u2019re required to pay.\n\nThere\u2019s still more. The Department of Health and Human Services is considering changing Obamacare\u2019s auto-renewal rules such that if you don\u2019t take action during the open enrollment window, you may be enrolled into a lower-cost plan. That isn\u2019t so good as it will sound to some, because if you happen to want to stay in your existing plan under these circumstances \u2013 and keep your doctors, clinics, cost structures and benefit options \u2013 you may be precluded from doing so under the reassignment. And you probably can\u2019t switch back once enrollment is closed. As Reason magazine\u2019s Peter Suderman observed, \u201ca hassle? Maybe. But have faith: They know what\u2019s best.\u201d\n\nAnd there\u2019s still more. A new report from Avalere Health reveals that insurers have increased premiums for the most popular plans sold on the exchanges after underpricing the policies last year. The average price for the 2015 exchange plans is increasing by 10 percent.\n\nThe bad news for Obama and his socialized-medicine disciples continues to pile up. A Gallup poll finds for the third consecutive year that the majority of Americans believe that it\u2019s not the responsibility of the federal government to make sure all Americans have health care.\n\nThe more people find out about the horrors of socialism in practice the more they reject it. That is axiomatic \u2013 even in today\u2019s America.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Free Press For A Free People Since 1997", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.1", "og": {"url": "http://www.wnd.com/2014/11/obamacare-the-bad-news-and-the-good-news/", "site_name": "WND", "type": "article", "description": "Whatever we do, let\u2019s not allow ourselves to be distracted from the continuing nightmare of Obamacare by the other nightmare of President Obama\u2019s latest abuse of power in furtherance of a terrible policy decision \u2013 this time on immigration.
