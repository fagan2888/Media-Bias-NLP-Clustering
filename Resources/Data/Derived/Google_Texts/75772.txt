MSNBC host Krystal Ball said Tuesday that Congressional Republicans trying to defund Obamacare would rather see uninsured people “die an agonizing and unnecessary death” if it meant making President Obama look bad, Mediaite.com first reported.

Miss Ball played a portion of an ad by the Virginia-based conservative group Generation Opportunity meant at dissuading young people from buying into Obamacare.

“The GOP is saying to young people, ‘We would like to have the government stick an unnecessary transvaginal probe if you want an abortion, but when it comes to health insurance, don’t take any government help,’” she said. “‘Don’t go to the state or federal government operated insurance exchanges to buy private insurance. Stay away.’

“Stay uninsured. Skip that pap smear. Skip that tetanus shot. Skip that prenatal care. Skip that cholesterol test. And if you die an agonizing and unnecessary death, one that could have been prevented by the health insurance reform that bears the president’s name, at least you know your death will not have been in vain.

“You will have died to serve the noble and patriotic cause of hurting this president and denying him a victory,” Miss Ball added. “They would sacrifice the lives of young people if it helped them score political points. That is not conservative. It is a national disgrace.”
