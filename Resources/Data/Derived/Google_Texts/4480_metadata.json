Obamacare architect Jonathan Gruber quite correctly attributed the passage of Obamcare to \u201clack of transparency\u201d and the \u201cstupidity of the American voter\u201d \u2013 because it turns out that Obamacare will ration care, and that the most well-respected bodies in terms of health rationing have already recommended cutting off services.\n\nThe US Preventive Services Task Force is an independent body authorized by Congress to make \u201cevidence-based recommendations about clinical preventive services such as screenings, counseling services, or preventive medications.\u201d And since the onset of Obamacare discussions, the Task Force recommendations for treatment and screening have become less and less generous. In November 2009, the Task Force recommended that mammography for women every other year between the ages of 50 and 74. They admit that they have insufficient information to suggest that it would be fruitless to screen after 74, and they say that case-by-case screenings should take place before 50.\n\nThe Mayo Clinic, by contrast, recommends annual mammograms for women above age 40; so too does the American Cancer Society. As Dr. Sandhya Pruthi of the Mayo Clinic writes, \u201cFindings from a large study in Sweden of women in their 40s who underwent screening mammograms showed a decrease in breast cancer deaths by 29 percent.\u201d\n\nThen there are colonoscopies: the Task Force recommends against routine colonoscopies for adults 76 to 85 years of age, and recommends against screening at all beyond age 85. The American Cancer Society and American College of Gastroenterology, by contrast, do not give an age limit for colonoscopies. Medicare, coincidentally, happens not to cover CT colonography but fully covers colonoscopies. A great way to cut costs: tell doctors not to give colonoscopies.\n\nHow about prostate cancer? The USPSTF completely recommends against prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening for prostate cancer. Every other major organization says that patients should make that decision with their doctor; the Mayo Clinic recommends \u201coffering PSA screening and DRE annually to men ages 50 to 75 with a life expectancy greater than 10 years.\u201d\n\nThe USPSTF recommendations are just that: recommendations. But as the Annals of Family Medicine reports, Obamacare \u201creinforces the ability of the secretary of the [Department of Health and Human Services] to add services to Medicare that were not given a D rating by the USPSTF. It also authorizes the secretary to remove preventive services not given an A, B, C, or I rating by the USPSTF.\u201d\n\nSo get ready, folks. Care may soon reflect the standards of the USPSTF. And that means that rationing of care is coming, and soon.\n\nBen Shapiro is Senior Editor-At-Large of Breitbart News and author of the new book, The People vs. Barack Obama: The Criminal Case Against The Obama Administration (Threshold Editions, June 10, 2014).
