The poverty rate in the neighborhood of Montview Park, which includes the Anschutz Medical Campus, is around 40 percent. That\u2019s roughly in line with the poverty rate in the Mississippi Delta.\n\nA persistent complaint has dogged the hospital in recent years, recorded in state warnings and public meetings. The thrust of it is that low-income patients have trouble getting in the door to see specialists or to get inpatient care.\n\nThe hospital strenuously refutes the assertion, noting that more than half of its patients have public insurance or none at all. Furthermore, University cites numbers to show that it was the second-largest provider of uncompensated care in the state in 2013, the most recent year for which numbers are available, behind only Denver Health.\n\nIn December 2013, the state regulatory office charged with oversight had a chance to bring answers to questions that have bred lingering resentment.\n\nSusan Birch, who heads the state department that administers Medicaid, sent a strongly worded letter to the hospital, writing that her office had received complaints that \u201cborder on patient abandonment.\u201d\n\nShe pledged to conduct an in-depth analysis of hospital records, using Medicaid claims data. If the analysis showed \u201ca conscious policy\u201d to deny access to Medicaid or indigent patients, the department would alert federal Medicaid and Department of Human Services officials.\n\nBut the analysis was never done.\n\nDawn Fetzko is a nurse practitioner who runs a small safety-net clinic in Aurora, south of the hospital. One of her patients is Juan Falcon, a 49-year-old Medicaid client who came to her in July.\n\nHe had an enlarged prostate that had brought him earlier to the emergency room of Aurora Medical Center, and he was concerned that it might be cancer.\n\nAfter a blood test showed worrying signs, Fetzko referred her patient to University Hospital in September last year for a biopsy. But she couldn\u2019t get him an appointment.\n\n\u201cAfter the Christmas holiday, no one had ever gotten back to me,\u201d says Fetzko. \u201cI made another phone call back to the urology department and they said, by the way, we\u2019re not going to accept him as a client.\u201d\n\nFetzko said many of her other patients have also had trouble getting into University Hospital. She\u2019s been sending her patients elsewhere \u2014 to Aurora Medical Center, or to other hospitals as far away as Parker and Boulder.\n\nLast fall, she helped organize a meeting between primary care providers and hospital administrators to air grievances. But she said she doesn\u2019t believe things have improved.\n\nOver the years, the state Medicaid office has received numerous complaints that echo Fetzko\u2019s.\n\n\u201cOur perception at the Department is that University Hospital is more focused on financials and the bottom line than serving Colorado\u2019s most vulnerable patients,\u201d Birch wrote in her December 2013 letter to Lilly Marks, the former chair of the hospital\u2019s board of directors.\n\nBirch spelled out several specific concerns, citing reports indicating that, among other things:\n\n\u2013 The hospital was limiting access to Medicaid and indigent patients. One patient, for instance, was given chemotherapy, but was told to go to another hospital for follow-up.\n\n\u2013 The hospital seemed to accept just enough indigent patients to qualify for a significant break on fees due from the hospital to the state.\n\n\u2013 The hospital was actively seeking to send Medicaid and indigent patients to other hospitals for emergency care.\n\nMarks refuted the allegations at length in a March 2014 letter to Birch.\n\nUniversity Hospital \u201cwould soon be financially incapacitated\u201d if it provided access to every indigent, uninsured and Medicaid patient seeking care, Marks said. Its mission by state statute is to be a state-of-the-art teaching and research university.\n\n\u201cLike all hospitals, we have to \u2018manage\u2019 access to services for (Colorado Indigent Care Program), self-pay and Medicaid patients in order to provide some reasonable balance to our overall payer-mix,\u201d Marks said in the letter.\n\nThe hospital flatly denied diverting Medicaid and indigent patients from its emergency department \u2014 an act that would violate federal law.\n\nAt the same time, Marks said the hospital has a tradition of providing care to medically underserved patients.\n\nDr. Christina Finlayson is a surgical oncologist at University Hospital. The hospital put her forward as the best spokesperson on the issue. She called Birch\u2019s letter \u201cvery hurtful\u201d to her colleagues.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t see ourselves that way at all,\u201d said Finlayson.\n\nUniversity Hospital draws its doctors from the faculty of the University of Colorado School of Medicine. Many of them could be earning higher salaries elsewhere, Finlayson said.\n\n\u201cYou come here for your ability to teach, your ability to do research, your ability to improve care for everyone across the city and the state,\u201d she said. \u201cTo have those accusations made is pretty hurtful because it really strikes at the core of what we consider our mission to be.\u201d\n\nA half mile from the hospital on a gleaming late March day, a group of nursing students from the Anschutz campus were knocking on doors at the King\u2019s Inn motel. They were volunteering for a local group called Colfax Community Network, which helps connect homeless people with food and other help.\n\nThe recession \u2014 and Denver\u2019s gentrification \u2014 have squeezed people without other shelter into motels like this one along Colfax.\n\nDesiree Martinez opened the door. She has been living here since September with her 7-year-old son. She\u2019s been to the University Hospital emergency room a few times \u2014 most recently when she was bitten by a brown recluse spider as she was sleeping on Christmas Eve, she said.\n\n\u201cThey gave me antibiotics and told me there was nothing I could do, and they sent me home,\u201d says Martinez.\n\nThe neighborhood around the hospital has sunk further into poverty over the past decade, as Anschutz Medical Campus has erected its world-class facilities in the footprint of the old Fitzsimons Army base. University Hospital opened its doors there in 2007. The poverty rate in Montview Park jumped 50 percent from 2000 to 2010.\n\nMegan Vizina, who heads the Colfax Community Network, says there\u2019s a negative perception of the hospital among the people she works with.\n\n\u201cA lot of folks here see it as the ivory tower,\u201d said Vizina. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of fear and a sense that they\u2019re not really connected to this community, despite being part of it.\u201d\n\nThe Affordable Care Act has meant that many more people now have insurance. Medicaid rolls especially have grown. For hospitals, this means less money spent on charity care, according to the Colorado Hospital Association, and more Medicaid patients.\n\nUniversity Hospital spokesman Dan Weaver said the hospital hasn\u2019t yet calculated how much charity care it provided in 2014. But he said that for all hospitals in the University of Colorado Health system \u2014 which also include Memorial Hospital in Colorado Springs and Poudre Valley Hospital in Fort Collins \u2014 Medicaid charges rose 69 percent to $1.8 billion, while indigent care sank 80 percent to $89 million. (Charity care and indigent care overlap, but they aren\u2019t the same; charity care is totally uncompensated, while some indigent care is paid for by state programs.)\n\nFalcon didn\u2019t account for any of those charges. He got his biopsy earlier this month by looking outside Aurora. Early in March, he showed up with his teenage daughter for an appointment with Dr. Fernando Kim at Denver Health.\n\nFalcon was worried. His father died at 76 from prostate cancer; he only lived three months after he was told he had cancer.\n\n\u201cIf they tell me, \u2018If you would have come six months earlier, you would have had a better chance,\u2019 I have to blame somebody for that,\u201d says Falcon.\n\nIn an interview with I-News, Birch, the state Medicaid office head, backed away from her concerns about University Hospital. She says she\u2019s now confident that University Hospital is acting aggressively to ensure access to Medicaid patients.\n\nIn a letter sent to the hospital after I-News began making inquiries, Birch thanked University of Colorado Health Systems chief executive officer Liz Concordia for a series of \u201chigh-level, productive\u201d meetings with her and her staff.\n\nWhen asked if Birch\u2019s original letter had been in error, Marc Williams, the spokesperson for state Medicaid department, said, \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a mistake. We have an obligation to look into concerns when they arise of these kinds of things. We are stewards of taxpayer dollars.\u201d\n\nIn the subsequent meetings with University Hospital officials, Williams said, the Medicaid office felt that further action wasn\u2019t warranted.\n\nBirch told I-News that her department has access to hospital records, and check them periodically. But pulling the data to prove \u2014 or disprove \u2014 any conscious policy of discrimination would be too costly, she said.\n\nThe Summit Daily News brings you this report in partnership with Rocky Mountain PBS I-News.
