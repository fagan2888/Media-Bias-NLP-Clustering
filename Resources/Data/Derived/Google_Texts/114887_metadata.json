We are proud that the 26 Native American Tribes of United South and Eastern Tribes (USET) joined us in support of this World Heritage nomination.\u201d\n\nPoverty Point features an extensive collection of earthworks constructed 3,100 to 3,700 years ago including a vast complex of structures, enormous concentric ridges, and a large plaza. It may even be the largest hunter-gatherer settlement that ever existed.\n\nAccording to the Louisiana Office of State Parks, it was built eight centuries after the Egyptian pyramids, but before the great Mayan pyramids in what is now northeastern Louisiana. The sophisticated builders constructed a complex array of earthen mounds and ridges overlooking the Mississippi River flood plain. The central construction at Poverty Point consists of six rows of concentric ridges, which form a semi-ellipse or C-shape that is divided into sections by at least four aisles.
