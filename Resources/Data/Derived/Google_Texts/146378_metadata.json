The Broncos beat the Colts 31-24 on Sunday, but the victory felt partially empty because of the expectations. Denver aims to be the first Super Bowl loser to win the next season in three decades.\n\nWas there disappointment in victory after the second-half survival?\n\n\u201cYou try to set a mindset where you are not like this. I don\u2019t think disappointment. As I told the team, you never make excuses for \u2018Ws\u2019 in this league. I don\u2019t care if it\u2019s one, 21 or 101 (point win),\u201d coach John Fox said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to win in this league. But we are going to make the corrections and learn from this. Guys won\u2019t be sensitive to coaching.\u201d\n\nThe Broncos raced to a 24-0 lead then held on with white knuckles, requiring critical defensive stops to escape. Denver\u2019s offense sputtered in the second half, totalling 88 yards. Denver\u2019s receivers dropped five passes, including multiple drops by Demaryius Thomas.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s something we\u2019ve got to clean up,\u201d Fox said.\n\nThe Broncos ran more on third-and-short, going three-for-three in those situations. That was a passing down 92 percent of the time a year ago, according to offensive coordinator Adam Gase. Fox wants the team to establish a more physical presence. The idea is sound, but the execution beyond the third-and-shorts was inefficient.\n\nThe Broncos rushed on 22 of their 31 first-down plays, gaining 50 yards. Montee Ball finished with 67 yards on the ground, forcing nine missed tackles on his 23 attempts, according to Pro Football Focus.\n\nOther notes from Fox\u2019s news conference:\n\n\u2014 Asked for his reaction to the Ravens cutting Ray Rice after the release of a TMZ video showing the running back punching his then-fiance, Fox was direct: \u201cMy personal feeling is that there\u2019s no place for (domestic violence) in our league or society.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Broncos safety David Bruton is not expected to miss time after dislocating his left shoulder. It popped back into place, with the co-captain Bruton saying Sunday night he could have returned to the game. Indianapolis\u2019 safety Colt Anderson wiped out Bruton on a touchback, upsetting the Broncos.\n\n\u201cYou make plays (on special teams) and you are considered a threat. Don\u2019t worry, every player seeks revenge on a shot like that,\u201d Bruton said. \u201cNah, I am not worried (about being unavailable this week). Honestly, I felt like I could have gone back in there.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Fox was pleased with the performance of Von Miller and Chris Harris in their return from knee surgery. Miller played 59 of 76 snaps, with Harris in on 41 plays. Miller graded out well on run defense, but wasn\u2019t able to consistently pressure Andrew Luck.\n\n\u201cVon played well. I think he\u2019d tell you \u2014 and I\u2019d tell you \u2014 that he\u2019s capable of better, just like everyone in that (locker) room,\u201d Fox said.\n\nTroy E.
