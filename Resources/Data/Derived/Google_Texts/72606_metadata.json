India's agriculture ministry has set up a committee to determine the price of cotton seeds, including fees the company charges for licensing crop genes.\n\n\"If the committee recommends imposing a sharp, mandatory cut in the trait fees paid on Bt-cotton seeds, MMBL will have no choice but to reevaluate every aspect of our position in India,\" Nirula said.\n\nThe company said it was \"shocked and disappointed\" at the news that the government plans to reduce the \"trait fees,\" or the fees that seed companies pay Mahyco Monsanto to use its crop genes, by around 70 percent.\n\nMonsanto said about 7 million cotton farmers in India use its seeds. Over the last two decades, millions of small farmers have adopted genetically modified cotton seeds, making India one of the world's biggest producers of cotton and a major exporter of raw cotton.\n\nHowever, farm activists say that the pest-resistance of the seeds has gone down and that farmers have to use more insecticide on their cotton crops.\n\nGenetically modified plants are grown from seeds that are engineered to resist insects and herbicides, add nutritional benefits or otherwise improve crop yields and increase the global food supply. Advocates say these new strains will boost yields and stabilize supply by also improving drought resistance.\n\nIndia has allowed the use of genetically modified seeds only to grow cotton. It says further study needs to be done to guarantee consumer safety before genetically modified food crops can be cultivated in the country.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Seeds of trouble: Monsanto threatens to pull out of India - AP News: NEW DELHI (AP) \u2014 U.S. seed giant Monsanto has threatened .05/27/2016 8:19:15AM EST.", "author": "AP News", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "NEW DELHI (AP) \u2014 U.S. seed giant Monsanto has threatened to pull its genetically modified", "title": "AP News - Seeds of trouble: Monsanto threatens to pull out of India", "url": "http://townhall.com/news/world/2016/03/06/seeds-of-trouble-monsanto-threatens-to-pull-out-of-india-n2129436", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2016\\66\\eb7b5003-019b-4dbc-aea2-0f50526c5c9e.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "NEW DELHI (AP) \u2014 U.S. seed giant Monsanto has threatened to pull its genetically modified", "title": "AP News - Seeds of trouble: Monsanto threatens to pull out of India", "url": "http://townhall.com/news/world/2016/03/06/seeds-of-trouble-monsanto-threatens-to-pull-out-of-india-n2129436", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2016/66/eb7b5003-019b-4dbc-aea2-0f50526c5c9e.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Seeds of trouble: Monsanto threatens to pull out of India, AP News, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "India has allowed the use of genetically modified seeds only to grow cotton.\nOver the last two decades, millions of small farmers have adopted genetically modified cotton seeds, making India one of the world's biggest producers of cotton and a major exporter of raw cotton.\nIt says further study needs to be done to guarantee consumer safety before genetically modified food crops can be cultivated in the country.\nIn December, India's government ordered that cotton seed prices, including royalties on seeds, be controlled from the 2016-17 crop year.\nNEW DELHI (AP) \u2014 U.S. seed giant Monsanto has threatened to pull its genetically modified crop technology from India if the government goes ahead with its plan to cut the company's royalty fees."}
