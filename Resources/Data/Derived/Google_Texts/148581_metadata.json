Democrats have failed to unite behind him.\n\nJOAN VENNOCHI: How the NRA thwarted a good doctor\n\nObama, meanwhile, on Friday appointed an \u201cEbola czar,\u201d Ron Klain, an expert in managing political crises who has no health background. Klain will not need Senate confirmation, but his appointment was seen by many observers as a sign that the administration had not been able to convey a public sense of control of the situation.\n\n\u201cThe right surgeon general could be a unifying force,\u201d said Dr. Richard Carmona, who held the post during George W. Bush\u2019s presidency. \u201cThe right surgeon general has the credibility.\u201d\n\nCarmona, who ran unsuccessfully for a Senate seat in Arizona as a Democrat after serving the Republican president, did not support Murthy\u2019s nomination, saying that Murthy did not have the experience and leadership credentials.\n\nBut other public health professionals, colleagues, and many Democrats have praised Murthy as a gifted and dedicated physician.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSenator Elizabeth Warren, the Massachusetts Democrat who introduced Murthy at his confirmation hearing in February, blamed Republican obstruction and \u201cright-wing groups [that] have decided they have a problem with his medical opinion that we ought to reduce the number of gun deaths in this country.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t govern crisis to crisis to crisis, but that\u2019s what the Republicans are forcing us to do,\u201d Warren said in an interview Monday.\n\nRepublicans, however, noted that Democrats who control the Senate could have confirmed Murthy without any help from Republicans under rule changes enacted last year that allow confirmation with a simple majority.\n\nSenate majority leader Harry Reid has declined to put the nomination up for a vote, with a leadership aide telling the Globe in March that there was uncertainty over whether some Democrats would support it. The White House said at the time that it was readjusting its strategy after a nomination for another high-level post failed. (A White House spokesman, asked to comment on the nomination, responded by e-mail that the surgeon general plays \u201can important role in the education of Americans on public health issues.\u201d)\n\n\u201cSenator Reid has not yet tried to bring up the nomination, due, no doubt, to the bipartisan opposition,\u201d Don Stewart, spokesman for minority leader Mitch McConnell, said in an e-mail.\n\nRepublicans questioned Murthy during his Senate confirmation hearing in February over comments he made on Twitter supporting gun control. During the 2012 campaign, Murthy used the Twitter account to issue strong praise for Obama and denunciations of his Republican opponent, former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney.\n\n\u201cTired of politicians playing politics w/ guns, putting lives at risk b/c they\u2019re scared of NRA,\u201d he wrote in October 2012, a comment that remains on his Twitter feed. \u201cGuns are a health care issue.\u201d\n\nOPINION | NATHANIEL MORRIS: A resume too partisan for surgeon general\n\nMurthy, who declined to comment for this article, said at the hearing that he believed the surgeon general should focus on areas where there is broad agreement, including prevention of chronic diseases, efforts to curb smoking, and programs to improve diets. And Warren said Monday that the surgeon general has no authority to set gun control policy.\n\nSenator Mark Begich, a Democrat facing a tough election in Alaska, said this year that he was leaning against supporting the nomination. Democrats are also facing tough electoral challenges in Louisiana, Arkansas, and New Hampshire, among other states where NRA opposition could be a political liability.\n\nSenator Mark Kirk of Illinois was the only Republican to join a 13-9 vote in February that supported the nomination in the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee.\n\nSurgeon generals are not members of the president\u2019s Cabinet and have little formal authority. Instead, they advise the administration and rely on a public platform to crusade for public health causes. The late C. Everett Koop, who held the job under presidents Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush, was the best-known person to hold the position, in large part because he used it to wage an unprecedented campaign to curb cigarette smoking and spoke out about AIDS prevention at a time when the disease was taboo.\n\nEDITORIAL: Obama must stand by Murthy\n\nThough an acting surgeon general currently holds the post, public health experts lament the absence of a confirmed official as Ebola concerns spread.\n\n\u201cThe surgeon general would be playing a vital role as a voice speaking directly to the American people,\u201d Dr. David Satcher, a former surgeon general under presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush, and former director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said in an interview.\n\nBut he said it would be inappropriate for the surgeon general to act as Ebola czar, because the position would lose its independence.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no point being a surgeon general if the only thing you say is what the White House wants you to tell people,\u201d he said.\n\nMurthy was born in England to Indian immigrants, went to high school in Miami, and graduated from Harvard College in three years, magna cum laude, with a degree in biochemical sciences. He earned a combined medical and business degree from Yale. Murthy also cofounded and still serves as president of Doctors for America, an organization of 16,000 doctors and medical students that advocated for Obama\u2019s health law.\n\nHe is also the founder of other public health groups and startups, including an HIV/AIDS education program serving youth in India and the United States and a community program serving rural India. He has also conducted research on vaccine development, according to his Doctors for America biography.", "article_metadata": {"eomportal-loid": "3.3.1384452636", "eomportal-id": 286157, "description": "WASHINGTON -- It\u2019s been nearly a year since President Obama made a surprise pick for US Surgeon General, a 36-year-old doctor from Brookline who founded a political group that advocated for the Affordable Care Act.
