But he never looked comfortable Saturday and spent much of the match scrambling around the court as Nishikori dictated points.\n\nIn the third-set tiebreaker, Djokovic had four unforced errors and a double-fault. Nishikori then broke him to open the final set, and Djokovic wasted three break points in the next game.\n\nNishikori converted 5 of 7 break points, while Djokovic was just 4 for 13.\n\nJapanese Men Grand Slam Semifinalists\n\n2014 U.S. Open \u2014 Kei Nishikori beat Novak Djokovic; vs. Roger Federer or Marin Cilic, Monday\n\n1933 Wimbledon \u2014 Jiro Satoh lost to Jack Crawford\n\n1933 French Championships \u2014 Satoh lost to Crawford\n\n1932 Australian Championships \u2014 Satoh lost to Harry Hopman\n\n1932 Wimbledon \u2014 Satoh lost to Bunny Austin\n\n1931 French Championships \u2014 Satoh lost to Jean Borotra\n\n1921 Wimbledon \u2014 Zenzo Shimizu lost to Manuel Alonso-Areyzaga\n\n1920 Wimbledon \u2014 Shimuzu lost to Bill Tilden\n\n1918 U.S. Championships \u2014 Ichiya Kumagae lost to Tilden\n\nThe Associated Press", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Kei Nishikori stuns Novak Djokovic in US Open semifinals", "title": "Kei Nishikori stuns Novak Djokovic in US Open semifinals", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/09/06/kei-nishikori-stuns-novak-djokovic-in-us-open-semifinals/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140906_012434_kei-nishikori.jpg", "height": 436}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140906_012434_kei-nishikori.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-09-06T13:22:35+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T08:42:29+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Under coach Michael Chang, the 1989 French Open champ, the 24-year-old Nishikori has sharpened his mental game to pull out victories like these.\nNishikori then broke him to open the final set, and Djokovic wasted three break points in the next game.\nNEW YORK \u2014 Japan\u2019s Kei Nishikori became the first man from Asia to reach a Grand Slam final, stunning top-ranked Novak Djokovic 6-4, 1-6, 7-6 (4), 6-3 in stifling heat Saturday at the U.S. Open.\nNishikori converted 5 of 7 break points, while Djokovic was just 4 for 13.\nDjokovic, who had reached the last four U.S. Open finals, outlasted two-time major champ Andy Murray in four long, tough sets in the quarters."}
