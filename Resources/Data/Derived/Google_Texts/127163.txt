â€” Raleigh police made an arrest Monday in a car crash turned homicide investigation after 24 hours of intense media coverage.

Police spokesman Jim Sughrue said that coverage "was instrumental" in encouraging the surrender of Rashand Nicholas Fitts.

Fitts, 30, is charged with the murder of Travis Donovan Rhodes.

Rhodes Ford Mustang swerved across oncoming traffic Saturday night on Raleigh's Capital Boulevard before coming to a stop on the shoulder.

Rhodes was taken to WakeMed, where doctors found the gunshot wound to his torso. Rhodes died at the hospital, and the homicide investigation began.

Police distributed surveillance images of a man and vehicle they say led them to identify Fitts as the suspect. The man in the photo is not Fitts but was with him shortly before the shooting, Sughrue said.
