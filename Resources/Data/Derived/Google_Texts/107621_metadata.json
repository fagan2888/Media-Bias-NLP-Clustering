Sales of both systems exploded out of the gate, but the PlayStation 4 soon pulled ahead and now the Xbox One trails by an increasing margin. At last count, Sony sold more than 6 million units through the beginning of March, while Microsoft\u2019s last official sales figure was 3 million Xbox One units sold in 2013. Now, according to the latest sales estimates, Sony\u2019s PS4 may in fact be widening its lead over the Xbox One.\n\nAccording to newly released sales estimates from VGChartz, PS4 sales during the week ending March 22nd totaled 220,349, up 67% from the prior week thanks to the debut of inFAMOUS: Second Son. That huge figure is nearly double the 112,513 Xbox One consoles sold worldwide during that week.\n\nThe figures are particularly troubling because the hotly anticipated Xbox One game Titanfall had just launched during the previous week. This indicates that the new mech-style shooter might not have provided the big continued boost to console sales that some industry watchers thought it might.\n\nDuring Titanfall\u2019s launch week, however, Microsoft did see a nice boost that pushed Xbox One sales past PS4 sales according to data from VGChartz. The site says that Xbox One sales totaled 155,157 units globally during the week ending on March 15th, while worldwide PS4 sales totaled 132,051 units that week.\n\nVGChartz says that total cumulative global PlayStation 4 sales sat at 6,563,350 as of March 22nd, while cumulative Xbox One sales reached 4,021,382 units.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30; polling-uri=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://feeds.feedburner.com/TheBoyGeniusReport&id=1;\r\npolling-uri2=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://feeds.feedburner.com/TheBoyGeniusReport&id=2; polling-uri3=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://feeds.feedburner.com/TheBoyGeniusReport&id=3; polling-uri4=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://feeds.feedburner.com/TheBoyGeniusReport&id=4; polling-uri5=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://feeds.feedburner.com/TheBoyGeniusReport&id=5", "application-name": "BGR", "twitter": {"account_id": 1512931133, "title": "PS4 sales double Xbox One as console war heats up", "image": "http://cdn.bgr.com/2013/06/xbox-one-playstation-4-sign.jpg", "creator": "@zacharye", "site": {"identifier": "@BGR", "id": 18131006}, "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "We\u2019re now well past the initial launch phase of the next-generation video game console \u201cwar\u201d that began last November when Sony and Microsoft each launched their new console offer\u2026"}, "keywords": "gaming, playstation 4, xbox one", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://bgr.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/616256b50efddd8ae9b0c7f1f339a9f5?s=16", "news_keywords": "PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Gaming", "generator": "WordPress.com", "author": "Zach Epstein", "msapplication-TileColor": "#0080FF", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "/wp-content/themes/vip/bgr/images/tile/square.png", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://i0.wp.com/cdn.bgr.com/2013/06/xbox-one-playstation-4-sign.jpg?resize=200%2C150", "description": "We're now well past the initial launch phase of the next-generation video game console \"war\" that began last November when Sony and Microsoft each launched their new console offerings.", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "/wp-content/themes/vip/bgr/images/tile/wide.png", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "/wp-content/themes/vip/bgr/images/tile/tiny.png", "msapplication-tooltip": "Mobile and tech news, reviews, opinions and insights", "robots": "all", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "/wp-content/themes/vip/bgr/images/tile/large.png", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://bgr.com/wp-content/themes/vip/bgr/images/tile/large.png", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/BGR", "published_time": "2014-04-01T21:34:56+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-04-01T21:34:58+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "og": {"site_name": "BGR", "description": "We\u2019re now well past the initial launch phase of the next-generation video game console \u201cwar\u201d that began last November when Sony and Microsoft each launched their new console offer\u2026", "title": "PS4 sales double Xbox One as console war heats up", "url": "http://bgr.com/2014/04/01/ps4-sales-vs-xbox-one-sales-march-2014/", "image": {"width": 870, "identifier": "http://cdn.bgr.com/2013/06/xbox-one-playstation-4-sign.jpg", "height": 618}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"page_id": 133848416626248, "app_id": 291809340883658}, "p": {"domain_verify": "8867409e5bd1c6669624a7ea019d2a9c"}, "sailthru.image.full": "http://i0.wp.com/cdn.bgr.com/2013/06/xbox-one-playstation-4-sign.jpg"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd242f\"", "article_summary": "The site says that Xbox One sales totaled 155,157 units globally during the week ending on March 15th, while worldwide PS4 sales totaled 132,051 units that week.\nDuring Titanfall\u2019s launch week, however, Microsoft did see a nice boost that pushed Xbox One sales past PS4 sales according to data from VGChartz.\nAccording to newly released sales estimates from VGChartz, PS4 sales during the week ending March 22nd totaled 220,349, up 67% from the prior week thanks to the debut of inFAMOUS: Second Son.\nThis indicates that the new mech-style shooter might not have provided the big continued boost to console sales that some industry watchers thought it might.\nThat huge figure is nearly double the 112,513 Xbox One consoles sold worldwide during that week."}
