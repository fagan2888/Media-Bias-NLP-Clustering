Iran’s government has issued a scathing commentary on the U.S. government’s treatment of citizens, saying the Eric Garner and Michael Brown police killings prove one thing: America is racist.

Iranian foreign ministry spokesman Marziyeh Afkham said in the government-run news agency, Fars: “The U.S. administration has continuously criticized other countries and made an instruments use of human rights and adopted double-standard criteria in the last few decades, while it has ignored domestic situation at home. … It is expected from the U.S. administration and judiciary to comply with their duty and take lawful and just actions in dealing with their citizens and stop the practice of racism and inhumane behavior,” Mediaite reported.

The Fars report then specifically referred to the national furor that’s been raging since the deaths of Brown and Garner. Brown was shot and killed by then-Officer Darren Wilson during an Aug. 9 altercation. Garner was placed in a chokehold on the streets of New York by Officer Daniel Pantaleo and died about an hour later.

Families of both suspects have expressed outrage that the officers were not indicted.
