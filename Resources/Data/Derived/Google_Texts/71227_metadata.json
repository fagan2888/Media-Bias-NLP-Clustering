Some paused, reflecting on the challenges of 2015 and what could likely be achieved in the coming year. Others answered with little hesitation, their priorities already set.\n\nThe act of looking back, then forward, is one most of us routinely do in our personal lives this time of year. We wanted people in positions of power and influence, and those representing influential groups in the community, to do the same for our region. Here are their answers.\n\nKip Hill\n\nA successful medical school\n\nLisa Brown, 59, president of Washington State University Spokane: \u201cWe are hoping and expecting to hear this year that we get the green light from the national accrediting body to accept our first class of medical students.\u201d\n\nScott Morris, 53, CEO of Avista Utilities: \u201cThe continued support of medical education in Spokane and the greater region, and support for both medical schools. The community has been fantastic getting the two medical schools funded and here, but we\u2019re about halfway home and we need to keep our eye on the ball.\u201d\n\nBuilding new things\n\nAndy Billig, 47, Democratic state senator from Spokane: \u201cI look forward to the groundbreaking of the U-District bike and pedestrian bridge, an early and important product of the bipartisan transportation infrastructure package that passed the Legislature earlier this year. The U-District bridge will increase accessibility, safety and community connections. This bridge is a key to fulfilling our bold community vision for a vibrant U-District that will pay dividends in education, economic development and quality of life for generations to come.\u201d\n\nKris Dinnison, 47, local author and co-owner of Boo Radley\u2019s and Atticus: \u201cI\u2019d like to see our part of the Inland Northwest continue to make the arts an integral part of our community, infrastructure and culture. Our region is finally starting to see the payoff that comes from making the arts a part of our lives, not just a thing that happens once in awhile.\u201d\n\nGlenn A. Johnson, 71, announcer for WSU football and basketball games and mayor of Pullman: \u201cI would love to see the state add some passing lanes to Highway 26 to help insure safer travel from Pullman to Seattle.\u201d\n\nMike Leach, 54, head football coach at Washington State University: \u201cI would like for us to get an indoor facility that would benefit all of the sports at Washington State. From a football standpoint I would like for us to continue improving as a team and have a lot of our young guys emerge as players.\u201d\n\nKelly Prior, 43, chief financial officer and executive vice president at Litehouse Foods Inc. in Sandpoint: \u201cIn this digital age I would like to see more affordable and accessible high-speed fiber and cellular broadband in our community. Many of our residents live in rural areas and have a need to be connected to the rest of the world. These more affordable and accessible networks would allow our community to enjoy the beauty of North Idaho while still being able to connect to their family, their employer or to each other.\u201d\n\nMarcus Riccelli, 37, Democratic state representative from Spokane: \u201cI would like the greater Spokane region to come together to pass a ballot measure to not only maintain but significantly enhance our public transit. This is important for economic development, and will fund critical projects across our region like the Central City Line to accommodate job and population growth. It is vital for the well-being of our community and will foster healthier neighborhoods, reduce traffic and ensure mobility for those with disabilities.\u201d\n\nJon Snyder, 46, outgoing Spokane City Council member and future adviser to Gov. Jay Inslee: \u201cI would like to see folks be able catch a bus above Francis on Nevada on Sundays. And riders should be able to reach the Valley CHAS Clinic. Saturday night symphony-goers should be able to take the bus home late. People on transit from Cheney to Airway Heights need a direct connection that doesn\u2019t go through downtown Spokane. Basically we need a ballot measure to pass the Spokane Transit Moving Forward Plan in 2016.\u201d\n\nJ.J. Wandler, 44, owner of Garageland: \u201cI\u2019d love to see a weekly downtown street market featuring local farmers, vintage dealers, retail sellers and food vendors.\u201d\n\nWalt Worthy, 69, prominent Spokane developer: \u201cI would like to see the people of Spokane agree to move forward with financing the new SportsPlex. Spokane needs to attract more citywide events and this would help greatly.\u201d\n\nProtecting what we have\n\nAdrienne Cronebaugh, 33, executive director of Kootenai Environmental Alliance: \u201cThe one thing I would like to see happen in Coeur d\u2019Alene/North Idaho in 2016 is a ban on phosphorus in fertilizers. High phosphorus levels in our water bodies have led to toxic blue-green algal blooms and increased aquatic plant growth. Preserving and restoring our waters to the cold clear lakes that make this place so desirable to live and play should be a priority.\u201d\n\nScott Fields, 44, Water Resources program manager, Coeur d\u2019Alene Tribe: \u201cI would like to see increased collaboration. In a world where it seems everyone is always fighting, we need to remember that we have so much more in common than not. In 2016, the Tribe would like to see all of the regional stakeholders and government agencies set aside our differences and come together to find real ways to work together to protect our gem, Coeur d\u2019Alene Lake, for the benefit of everyone in the region.\u201d\n\nSam Mace, 47, Inland Northwest director, Save Our Wild Salmon: \u201cI\u2019d like to see more people join the growing call to do right by one of our region\u2019s most valuable and iconic species \u2013 wild salmon \u2013 and support removal of the four lower Snake River dams. With the value of the dams declining and the costs of maintaining them rising, it\u2019s time in 2016 for an honest assessment of what restoring the lower Snake to free-flowing could bring the Inland Northwest in terms of salmon, jobs and recreation.\u201d\n\nAmanda Parrish, 29, watershed program manager for The Lands Council: \u201cI\u2019d like to see Spokane County really take on water conservation. We had one of the worst droughts we\u2019ve ever had last year and we don\u2019t know what 2016 will bring. Maybe we\u2019ll have a lot of moisture from an El Nino year; we don\u2019t know. But enacting water conservation measures and getting into those habits is going to be really important. I\u2019d like to see our leaders taking proactive steps. \u2026 We need that type of leadership right now.\u201d\n\nSharma Shields, 37, local author: \u201cI\u2019d love to see people come out and really support their public libraries, passing the bonds they need and fueling them with donations or volunteerism or even just membership. Libraries are the great equalizer and they really do help our communities from the inside out. A healthy, robust library directly contributes to a healthy, robust and most importantly, educated community. I was very sad when the Spokane County Library District 2015 bond failed. I\u2019m hoping we can all make this an issue and ensure that our libraries thrive in 2016 and beyond.\u201d\n\nJerry White Jr., 52, Spokane Riverkeeper: \u201cWhat I resolve to do is to educate the Spokane area about the issues that face our tributary rivers like Hangman Creek, which is critical to the health of the Spokane River. \u2026 Hangman is a particular focus because it\u2019s so polluted and so damaged. The soil erosion is incredible, and it\u2019s really hard on the creek.\u201d\n\nTurning the economy around\n\nMike Allen, 48, outgoing Spokane City Council member: \u201cEconomic development. We lost momentum when economic development was folded into GSI. We need to step back as a community and examine how we are conducting economic development and really discuss where we\u2019re going in the future. That includes mom-and-pop stores to recruiting large corporations. Economic development happens in many layers.\u201d\n\nDavid Condon, 41, Spokane mayor: \u201cSpokane has experienced more than $1 billion in new economic investment citywide over the past three years. Those investments have helped grow community events and attract new national brands while generating momentum and a renewed confidence that is good for Spokane. It has created new jobs, greater opportunities for families and invigorated an already compassionate community to support each other in new ways. The next year will be full of exciting new opportunities.\u201d\n\nCheryl Kilday, 54, president and CEO of Visit Spokane: \u201cMy hope is that we have genuinely all four seasons so that all of our seasonal businesses prosper and that visitors have four different, great reasons to come throughout the year.\u201d\n\nTyler Lafferty, 40, principal at Seven2, digital advertising agency in Spokane: \u201cWe have a number of successful current and retired executives who have a wealth of knowledge on starting, operating and growing businesses. I\u2019d really like to see them get connected through GSI\u2019s Startup Spokane program as a mentor to entrepreneurs in our region. Often times these entrepreneurs just need a bit of guidance to get them to the next level in their business.\u201d\n\nRaul Labrador, 48, Republican U.S. representative from Eagle, Idaho: \u201cMy hope for 2016 and beyond is more economic growth, including robust revival in our natural resources industries and expansion in the promising high-tech sector. Idaho\u2019s entrepreneurial spirit, work ethic and quality of life are unmatched, and I hope that we can create the environment to allow all Idahoans to thrive.\u201d\n\nCathy McMorris Rodgers, 46, Republican U.S. representative from Spokane: \u201cLet\u2019s continue to open our region to the future by leading the way in innovation and technological development. From the farmer on the Palouse to the programmer in the University District, I believe this is how we can empower every person to pursue their own dreams \u2013 regardless of who they know, how connected they are, or what box they check on a census form.\u201d\n\nTodd Mielke, 51, outgoing Spokane County commissioner and future Greater Spokane Incorporated CEO : \u201cI would certainly like to see a real economic recovery for the Spokane area.\u201d\n\nSusan Meyer, 58, CEO of Spokane Transit Authority: \u201cMy hope for 2016 is sustained economic growth throughout the Spokane region. Prosperous communities not only grow jobs, invest in infrastructure, prioritize education, improve recreation, and attract visitors; they connect it all with terrific transit service. That\u2019s how great cities (and regions) move.\u201d\n\nBen Stuckart, 44, Spokane City Council president: \u201cI\u2019d like to see a unified vision of economic development for the whole region, including all the cities, counties and economic development agencies in one agreed-upon document so we\u2019re all speaking the same language.\u201d\n\nBring on the fast food\n\nJim Hayford, 48, head men\u2019s basketball coach at Eastern Washington University: \u201cI would like to see In and Out Burger start a franchise in Spokane.\u201d\n\nRod Sandberg, 46, head football coach at Whitworth University: \u201cBring a Chick-fil-A franchise to Spokane!!! #2 is bring a Dunkin\u2019 Donuts franchise to Spokane!\u201d\n\nAnd other types of food, drink\n\nRenee Cebula, 58, owner of Raising the Bar barware company: \u201cPublic education \u2013 connecting people to the stories behind the classic and craft-cocktails. Each glass contains huge swaths of history, of humanity, of experiences. Cheers!\u201d\n\nAdam Hegsted, 35, chef/owner of The Yards and member of Eat Good Group: \u201cTo have our culinary and arts community continually growing in a positive direction with the support of our great local cities! Hard not to be positive about our scene\u2019s growth. Let\u2019s keep it progressing and pushing forward.\u201d\n\nRyan Stoy, 31, chef and owner at The Wandering Table: \u201cSpokane is ready for a Northwest Food and Wine extravaganza! A true block party worthy of our region. We all work so hard to create and inspire, it\u2019s time we share with the world!\u201d\n\nA safer, friendlier community\n\nDeb Conklin, 62, chair of the Office of Spokane Police Ombudsman Commission: \u201cWhat I would most like for Spokane in 2016 is that we all learn how to be a community that comes together and gets things done that improve life for all our residents \u2013 especially those with the fewest resources and most challenges \u2013 and that we adamantly reject the cultural invitation to live \u2018me first\u2019 lives.\u201d\n\nRick Dobrow, 55, interim Spokane Police chief: \u201cWe all see that we need to continue to work very diligently to rebuild trust between the community and the police. \u2026 I think that\u2019s always a good thing \u2013 to go into a new year with that as a reminder.\u201d\n\nAl French, 64, Spokane County commissioner: \u201cWhat I want for everyone is love, wisdom, health and happiness.\u201d\n\nMark Kadel, 60, director of World Relief Spokane: \u201cThe biggest thing for World Relief is that Spokane would continue to be a welcoming community to refugees fleeing for their lives and being resettled in our community.\u201d\n\nLynn Kimball, 33, executive director at Aging & Long Term Care of Eastern Washington: \u201cI would like to see more families, seniors and people with disabilities in our region aware of community resources to help them plan to stay at home and age in place.\u201d\n\nLori Kinnear, 62, incoming Spokane City Council member: \u201cGiven the two major events this year, the fires and windstorm, I\u2019d like us to make some meaningful headway on our emergency systems. We need to fully fund our fire department. We have to fix this before the next big thing happens.\u201d\n\nMatt Logie, 35, head men\u2019s basketball coach at Whitworth: \u201cLess gun violence!\u201d\n\nRob McCann, 46, executive director at Catholic Charities: \u201cMy hope \u2026 is that the entire community would embrace the idea that every human being is made in the image and likeness of God. And if we believe that, we have to believe that human beings deserve respect and compassion and basic human dignity.\u201d\n\nKahlil Moore, 18, senior at Lewis and Clark High School: \u201cMy hope would be for people\u2019s outlook on the homeless community in Spokane to turn around. For people to be willing to say hello when you pass a homeless person and not being afraid of being near them.\u201d\n\nTom Sahlberg, 63, member of the Washington Parole Board and lifelong resident: \u201cSomething I\u2019d like to see happen in our community in 2016 is that we regain the spirit of community. If we can build on all that is good in our area, we can make it great together. We need each other to build consensus for the common good and to make needed changes that benefit us all. The credit and the responsibility for the issues we face rests squarely on each of us.\u201d\n\nKaren Stratton, 56, Spokane City Council member: \u201cFor 2016, I would like for every homeless person in our community to have a safe place to live and I would like for all of us to be kinder to each other.\u201d\n\nBeck Taylor, 46, president of Whitworth University: \u201cMy prayer and hope for the region is unity. May we be a community known for its love, cooperation, understanding and inclusion, where all people have the opportunity to flourish.\u201d\n\nTaking care of children\n\nMark Hurtubise, 67, president and CEO of Inland Northwest Community Foundation: \u201cOur wish, at Inland Northwest Community Foundation, is that all of us in this region embrace and act upon the belief that every child is ours, regardless of background or circumstances. If this becomes a community resolution, then a child\u2019s achievements are lasting triumphs for every neighborhood and household.\u201d\n\nLuke Malek, 33, Republican state representative from Coeur d\u2019Alene: \u201cI see many neglected, abused and troubled kids. If I could change anything in the region, it would be a loving, safe home, good educational resources for every child in the region.\u201d\n\nTom Rockefeller, 59, superintendent of Mead School District: \u201cFor me it\u2019s just the safety of the kids, creating an environment where we can ensure the safety and harmony for our kids to be raised and educated in.\u201d\n\nEarly, secondary and higher education\n\nMary Cullinan, 65, president of EWU: \u201cI would love this region to be more intentionally focused on increasing the college-going rate for students in this region. I think we really need to be getting the word out to everyone in elementary and high school that college is affordable and that you need to be making plans all along. And that means getting families involved.\u201d\n\nLynn Kimball, 33, executive director at Aging & Long Term Care of Eastern Washington: \u201cI would like to see more families, seniors and people with disabilities in our region aware of community resources to help them plan to stay at home and age in place.\u201d\n\nMax McCullough, 17, senior basketball standout at Post Falls High School: \u201cI would like to see the Greater Spokane League schools compete more with the Inland Empire League schools.\u201d\n\nShelly Redinger, 48, superintendent of Spokane Public Schools: \u201cIt is my wish that the new year brings joyous and fulfilling education opportunities for all of our students in Spokane Public Schools.\u201d\n\nBen Small, 41, superintendent of Central Valley School District: \u201cThe thing that I would love to see in the region is for us to build on the tremendous strengths of an education system that spans K-20. Specifically, I think highlighting the relationship between K-12 education and higher education and building a STEM-ready workforce.\u201d\n\nTaking care of minds and bodies\n\nTom Martin, 65, chief executive officer and superintendent of Lincoln County Public Hospital District No. 3: \u201cI would like to see the proposed 100-bed inpatient psychiatric hospital at Sacred Heart Medical Center become a reality. I have witnessed, over my career, an ever-growing need for intensive mental health services within our region and across the state.\u201d\n\nJoel McCullough, 56, chief medical officer for the Spokane Regional Health District: \u201cWe\u2019re hoping to be more effective in what we call \u2018health in all policies.\u2019 It\u2019s an approach where all sorts of policymakers would take health considerations into account when they adopt new public policies, whether it\u2019s a housing or transportation or economic development issue. Most policies that get enacted have a health impact, whether policymakers realize it or not.\u201d\n\nLora Whalen, 55, director of the Panhandle Health District: \u201cIt would be that people make healthy choices and thus lead healthy lifestyles. Obesity is an issue in Idaho \u2013 the adult obesity rate is around 30 percent. All of us, perhaps, want to lose a few pounds as part of our New Year\u2019s resolutions. If we could take steps to lose the weight, maintain that weight loss and choose to be more physically active \u2026We live in the most beautiful place. There are so many things you can do that don\u2019t require a gym membership.\u201d\n\nCriminal justice reforms\n\nLarry Haskell, 61, Spokane County prosecutor: \u201cNext year, I will ensure that we continue to hold offenders accountable to the law and to each of you. We are committed to accomplishing this with the most effective use of your tax dollars consistent with your safety. To that end, we have joined forces with several other agencies in a significant grant application that, if awarded to Spokane, will greatly assist the county with additional staffing and resources.\u201d\n\nShelly O\u2019Quinn, 40, Spokane County commissioner: \u201cI would like to see Spokane County reduce the number of mentally ill individuals in our jail. Each year, there are an estimated 2 million people with serious mental illnesses admitted to jails across the nation \u2026 The human toll of this problem \u2013 and its cost to taxpayers \u2013 is staggering.\u201d\n\nMike Padden, 69, Republican state senator from Spokane Valley: \u201cI would like to see the Spokane region benefit from strengthening Washington\u2019s felony DUI law, something that would not only benefit the Spokane area, but the entire state. We currently require five convictions in 10 years for a prison term. Idaho and Oregon require three. All other felony DUI states require four or fewer. By increasing our standard to four, we can reduce the pain and suffering caused by this most preventable crime.\u201d\n\nJackie van Wormer, 48, Spokane Regional Criminal Justice administrator and Washington State University professor: \u201cI want to see continued collaboration among the criminal justice stakeholders, so that we can continue to see efficiencies in the criminal justice system, and cut costs.\u201d\n\nSaluting and taking care of our veterans\n\nErnie Kent, 60, head men\u2019s basketball coach at Washington State University: \u201cMy New Year\u2019s wish would be for all of our troops, including those in Eastern Washington and Western Idaho, to be kept safe and that they are able to return home to their loved ones.\u201d\n\nPatty Murray, 65, Democratic U.S. senator from Bothell: \u201cOne of my highest priorities is making sure we improve care for the men and women who\u2019ve served our country. There have been too many problems with the Veterans Choice Program for local veterans, so I\u2019ve challenged my colleagues in Congress to join me to overhaul it in 2016 so we can help veterans around Spokane and the country receive better coordinated care. We must fulfill the promise to take care of veterans long after the war is over.\u201d\n\nMaking the most of each day\n\nEdmund Schweitzer, 68, founder of Schweitzer Engineering Laboratories in Pullman: \u201cThomas Edison said, \u2018Opportunity is missed by most people because it is dressed in overalls and looks like work.\u2019 You never know where the next big breakthrough or discovery will come from. \u2026 So in 2016 I\u2019d like to see people seize the many opportunities that exist throughout our region and share Edison\u2019s work experience: \u2018I never did a day\u2019s work in my life. It was all fun.\u2019 \u201d\n\nGo Zags\n\nDon Kardong, 66, Bloomsday founder/director and Olympic marathoner: \u201cI\u2019d like the Zags to make the Final Four.\u201d\n\nCandace Mumm, 54, Spokane City Council member: \u201cThat\u2019s an easy question. Both Gonzaga basketball teams in the Final Four.\u201d\n\nThe following Spokesman-Review staff contributed to this project: Rachel Alexander, Alison Boggs, Jim Camden, Erica Curless, Nicholas Deshais, Thomas Clouse, Eli Francovich, Addy Hatch, Kip Hill, Adriana Janovich, Becky Kramer, Greg Lee, Scott Maben, Joe Palmquist, Mike Prager, Betsy Z.
