One of those people, who really has no say in any decision making process, is Mark Zuckerberg. The creator of Facebook was at an event this week called \u201cHackathon\u201d promoting his ideas about the American immigration system, specifically amnesty.\n\nThe event hosted at LinkedIn\u2019s headquarters invites 20 young immigrants who came to the country illegally as children (Dreamers) to spend 25 hours coding web tools to advocate for immigration reform.\n\nIn his kickoff speech Zuckerberg said, \u201cI think this is one of the biggest civil rights issue of our time\u2026We\u2019re at a pretty critical moment in the movement right now where it\u2019s really important to keep pushing ahead.\u201d\n\nZuckerberg recently started a political advocacy group that is funded by many of the tech industry\u2019s biggest names. This group works to promote legislation that includes a path to citizenship for more than 11 million immigrants currently living in the U.S.\n\nI guess Mr. Zuckerberg doesn\u2019t really know the definition of a civil right. It is not a right for every citizen on this earth to be able to live in the United States. There is a process in place for people to enter this country legally, to provide the chance for opportunity. However, this country would not be able to sustain itself if anyone could come here whenever they wanted. The melting pot society is a great one. But if the U.S. can\u2019t continue to be a place of opportunity due to a drain on our system with too many citizens, haven\u2019t we ruined what America was supposed to be in the first place?", "article_metadata": {"description": "With immigration reform still on the agenda, many people have decided to make their opinions on the issues clear.
