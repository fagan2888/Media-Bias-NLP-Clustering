Associated Press\n\nWhen he was governor of South Carolina, David Beasley proposed removing the Confederate flag from the Capitol dome. The proposal was widely seen as costing him his re-election in 1998, and it brought death threats to his family.\n\nOn Tuesday, Mr. Beasley, a Republican, took a triumphant lap around the State Capitol, a day after the current GOP governor, Nikki Haley, and other state officials called for the flag to be removed from the statehouse grounds. It had been relocated from the dome to a nearby spot in 2000.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t mind the threats against me,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Beasley said in an interview Tuesday. \u201cThe threats against the family were difficult. We got letters, calls, some of it all. You cannot believe how vitriolic, how intense it was.\n\n\u201cBut that was then. This is now.\u201d\n\nMr. Beasley\u2019s 1996 proposal to remove the flag was thwarted in a nasty political fight. Ku Klux Klan members came to the Capitol. The battle paralyzed the rest of the state\u2019s political agenda. Voters overwhelmingly wanted the flag to stay, polls at the time showed, and Mr. Beasley was sharply attacked by political opponents.\n\nAfter he left office, Mr. Beasley, the descendant of a Civil War soldier, left politics and returned to his home in Darlington.\n\nSouth Carolina has changed in \u201can amazingly wonderful way,\u201d he said, after meeting with Ms. Haley.\n\nMany legislators who opposed him 18 years ago, he said, now have a different tune. \u201cThey want to act quickly,\u201d he said. Some of those who opposed him have left the Senate. Rep. Mark Sanford, a South Carolina Republican, said one of the reasons he decided to support bringing the flag down was that his phone had blown up with residents wanting it gone.\n\nMr. Beasley said many people had come around to his position.\n\n\u201cThey aren\u2019t just saying this to me because I\u2019m the governor who lost because of the flag. They see me with their heart, with emotions. They\u2019re saying it\u2019s time. I\u2019m just telling them, `You\u2019re right, it is time,\u2019 \u201d Mr. Beasley said.\n\n\u201cIt was my opinion a long time ago, but that was just my opinion", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "Former Republican South Carolina Gov.
