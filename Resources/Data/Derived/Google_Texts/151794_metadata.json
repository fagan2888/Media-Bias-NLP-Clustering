How long ago was it that Rubio, like Ryan, was a bright young conservative talent with nothing but smooth road ahead?\n\nRubio the Florida senator, was at one time the nation\u2019s first Hispanic president-in-waiting, the legislative craftsman who fashioned comprehensive immigration reform before everything went south. Running for president, Rubio confronted the night furies and daylight delusions of Republican madness, and they devoured him. By the time his political corpse was discovered by the roadside, he had been reduced to \u201cLittle Marco,\u201d a sweaty, small-time operator from Miami trafficking in crude jokes.\n\nRyan may be shrewder than Rubio, which should help, and more principled, which almost certainly won\u2019t. Both loyally represent the donor wing, but Ryan appears to have a firmer foundation in the party. Indeed, since the dawn of the Obama era, Ryan\u2019s foundation has been a pedestal, upon which he has towered over party regulars.\n\nSince being nominated for vice president in 2012, Ryan, R-Wisconsin, simultaneously has occupied the roles of bright young comer and party elder, policy whiz and political sage. When Donald Trump absent-mindedly neglected to renounce the support of an organization infamous for a century-long rampage of white supremacist violence, Ryan put Trump, who\u2019s old enough to be Ryan\u2019s father, on notice. \u201cI hope this is the last time I need to speak out on this race,\u201d Ryan told reporters.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBright, charismatic, handsome, articulate and seemingly beyond reproach in his ethics and personal life, Ryan is in serious danger. Having accepted the speakership under shaky circumstances, he is leader of a House conference riven by faction with little hope of achieving its key goals. His party, caught between the cruel mockery of Donald Trump and the cold cynicism of Ted Cruz, is on the verge of bursting into flames. Ryan\u2019s signature policy cocktail, a double helping of champagne for the rich and a spent lemon for the poor, appears increasingly ludicrous in a country vexed by economic insecurity and inequality and riding multiple waves of populism.\n\nAt this seemingly inauspicious career moment, the speaker on Wednesday asked the nation to raise its gaze.\n\n\u201cWhen people distrust politics, they come to distrust institutions,\u201d he said. \u201cThey lose faith in their government and the future too. We can acknowledge this. But we can\u2019t accept it. And we can\u2019t enable it either.\u201d\n\nRyan leads a party that has spent the past four decades working diligently to discredit first the Supreme Court, then Congress and the presidency. The court was not a hall of justice, according to a long, vitriolic war waged by Republicans, but a Tammany Hall of liberal \u201cjudicial activism\u201d that deliberately defiled the constitution. The character of Congress was \u201ccorrupt,\u201d according to the renowned ethicist Newt Gingrich, who began dismantling the institution in earnest in 1995. And the deliberations of that legislature, culminating in the black night of Obamacare and its \u201cdeath panels\u201d in 2010, were nothing short of criminal. The presidency, first of Bill Clinton, later of Barack Obama, was illegitimate when a Democrat occupied the White House.\n\nYes, the left howled when the Supreme Court voted to make George W. Bush president. But Al Gore and the Democratic establishment accepted the dubious outcome. The only equivalence between Republican and Democratic assaults on governing legitimacy is a false one. Does Ryan recall Ronald Reagan\u2019s oft-repeated knee-slapper, the one about the \u201cnine most terrifying words\u201d in the English language? \u201cI\u2019m from the government and I\u2019m here to help,\u201d Reagan chuckled.\n\nRyan can\u2019t be oblivious to his party\u2019s ferocious crusade to destroy faith in government. Just as he can\u2019t have missed that the current contest under way for the GOP presidential nomination is almost devoid of his trademark \u201cideas.\u201d The main combatants consist of two politicians who glory in the destruction of governing norms, one of whom is a comprehensive ignoramus. Having destabilized government, conservatives are now blasting the foundations of the Republican Party.\n\nRyan\u2019s path out of this rubble is unclear. That his policies are going nowhere may be his greatest blessing. He deserves credit for grappling with the realities of poverty more seriously than other Republicans. But after years as the Republican Einstein, his donor-friendly ideas remain blissfully untested in the marketplace, and even Ryan can\u2019t defy gravity forever.\n\nAs his party descends, he\u2019ll need a way to keep his ambition afloat above the destruction. His agenda, the opposite of populism, has been nullified by the 2016 election, as it was by the elections of 2012 and 2008. This time, death should be permanent.\n\nOn Wednesday, Ryan invoked our better angels, establishing a sharp character contrast with Cruz and Trump, neither of whom could\u2019ve delivered a similarly elevated speech. To move forward, whether at a contested convention in July or, more likely, in a subsequent presidential campaign, Ryan will need to deftly alter his agenda without appearing to abandon his principles, and without losing his base of support in the party. It\u2019s going to take skill and luck to survive the Republican conflagration. Ask Rubio.\n\nFrancis Wilkinson writes on politics and domestic policy for Bloomberg View.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Opinion, Opinion news, Pontiac Opinion news, MI Opinion news, US Opinion news, world Opinion news.", "title": "Column: Paul Ryan faces the raging Republican fire", "og": {"url": "http://www.theoaklandpress.com/opinion/20160325/column-paul-ryan-faces-the-raging-republican-fire", "image": {"width": "1500px", "identifier": "http://www.theoaklandpress.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/OP/20160325/LOCAL1/160329641/AR/0/AR-160329641.jpg?Maxh=1500&Maxw=1500", "height": "988px"}, "type": "article", "title": "Column: Paul Ryan faces the raging Republican fire"}, "twitter": {"domain": "theoaklandpress.com", "description": "Watching Paul Ryan deliver his high-minded, optimistic call to a better politics on Wednesday, I kept thinking of Marco Rubio.
