Human rights groups fear that the cause to which she is committed \u2014 bringing women into public life in the deeply conservative country \u2014 is also in peril.\n\nWith U.S. and NATO combat troops set to withdraw by the end of the year and many international organizations also scaling back operations, they fear that the Afghan government will be under less pressure to uphold women\u2019s rights, providing a new opening for conservatives to roll back gains made since the 2001 U.S.-led invasion that toppled the Taliban.\n\n\u201cI was the target of this attack simply because I am a defender of women\u2019s rights, a defender of human rights, and I value democracy and freedom of speech,\u201d Barakzai said from her hospital bed.\n\nNo one claimed responsibility for the attack, which bore the hallmarks of the Haqqani network, a Taliban affiliate based in Pakistan that sends suicide bombers against prominent targets.\n\nAttacks in the capital Kabul have escalated since President Ashraf Ghani took office in September. Insurgent groups oppose the bilateral security agreement he signed with Washington, ratified by Parliament on Sunday, as well as his support for women\u2019s rights and peace talks with the Taliban.\n\nAs Ghani prepares to meet international donors in London next month, he is under pressure from rights advocates as well as allies like Barakzai to stick to his commitments and ensure women have a central role in any peace talks.\n\nBut he is under equal or greater pressure from insurgents and conservatives in the Afghan government to abandon those commitments as the price for peace.\n\nJorrit Kamminga, a policy adviser for the charity Oxfam, says peace is not possible unless women are involved in the process.\n\n\u201cThe exclusion of women will lead to an imperfect and unsustainable peace,\u201d he said in an interview to coincide with the release Monday of a report titled \u201cBehind Closed Doors.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t need to promote women\u2019s rights, it is already in the constitution,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat we need to do is urge the government to respect the constitution and carry it through to peace talks, connect those two elements, and make sure that women\u2019s rights are connected to those peace efforts.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Fear for Afghan women\u2019s rights as troops withdraw", "title": "Fear for Afghan women\u2019s rights as troops withdraw", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Fear for Afghan women\u2019s rights as troops withdraw", "title": "Fear for Afghan women\u2019s rights as troops withdraw", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/11/24/fear_for_afghan_womens_rights_as_troops_withdraw/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/11/afghanistan-womens-rights-in-peril.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Fear for Afghan women\u2019s rights as troops withdraw", "title": "Fear for Afghan women\u2019s rights as troops withdraw", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/11/afghanistan-womens-rights-in-peril.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Lynne O'donnell", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9ab5\"", "article_summary": "Insurgent groups oppose the bilateral security agreement he signed with Washington, ratified by Parliament on Sunday, as well as his support for women\u2019s rights and peace talks with the Taliban.\n\u201cI was the target of this attack simply because I am a defender of women\u2019s rights, a defender of human rights, and I value democracy and freedom of speech,\u201d Barakzai said from her hospital bed.\nTopics: From the Wires, NewsKABUL, Afghanistan (AP) \u2014 Afghan lawmaker Shukria Barakzai says the suicide bomber who plowed into her motorcade a week ago wanted to silence a voice on women\u2019s rights with a deafening blast.\n\u201cWhat we need to do is urge the government to respect the constitution and carry it through to peace talks, connect those two elements, and make sure that women\u2019s rights are connected to those peace efforts.\u201d\nHuman rights groups fear that the cause to which she is committed \u2014 bringing women into public life in the deeply conservative country \u2014 is also in peril."}
