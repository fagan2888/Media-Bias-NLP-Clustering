The sheer number of people onstage at the GOP debates might leave low-information voters overwhelmed, with only the best communicators in the field capable of creating a strong impression on them. A guy like Kasich, who\u2019s sharp enough on camera to have hosted his own Fox show, might look at all that and conclude that anyone really can win this time. Especially if they happen to govern a swing state that\u2019s a must-have for Republicans against Hillary.\n\nAnd then there were 237:\n\nJohn Kasich is \u201cvirtually certain\u201d to jump into the race for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination, sources close to the Ohio governor tell ABC News. Kasich has said his wife and daughters have given him a green light to run and in recent days Kasich has told his political advisors to begin preparing for a likely campaign. Kasich travels to New Hampshire in early June and recently did a fundraising trip to California. If he makes the final decision to run, he will make the announcement in late June or July. As a Republican elected twice as governor of the critical battleground state of Ohio, Kasich is a potentially formidable candidate. But he has also angered conservative Republicans with his decision to accept an expansion of the Medicaid program under Obamacare. He has also supported the Common Core educational standards, something derided by some conservatives as \u201cObamacore.\u201d\n\nLike Bobby Jindal, he has both executive experience as a governor and Beltway experience as a former congressman. Unlike Bobby Jindal, his approval rating back home is better than 31 percent. A month ago I thought his murmuring about running for president was more a wink at the VP nod, but now I don\u2019t know. Scott Walker, who occupies the midwestern governor niche that Kasich is hoping to fill, burst ahead of the pack in early polls a few months ago but has since fallen back a bit, suggesting some vulnerability. Jeb Bush, the 800-pound establishment gorilla who needs four tries to answer a simple question about Iraq, doesn\u2019t scare anyone anymore apart from his fundraising. Rick Perry\u2019s under indictment and may be dismissed as a joke by some GOP voters because of his poor 2012 campaign. Mike Huckabee\u2019s probably destined to end up a social-con niche candidate and will have trouble building on his 2008 share of the vote given the more talented field this time. Jindal\u2019s polling in the low single digits despite being known as a budding national superstar within the party for the past decade. And Chris Christie is Chris Christie. Long story short, if you\u2019re a GOP voter who\u2019s set on a governor this time (especially if you\u2019re an Iowan who might find a fellow midwesterner appealing), you may find after a few debates that Kasich is your best bet. Worst-case scenario: He jumps in, is mediocre on the stump, but raises his name recognition enough that he ends up moving even higher on the VP shortlist. The nomination\u2019s basically a lottery this year given the size of the field. Why wouldn\u2019t Kasich buy a ticket?\n\nSpeaking of longshot candidates running let\u2019s-see-what-happens campaigns to raise their profiles, here\u2019s your next defense secretary teasing his own announcement next month. While you watch, your exit question: Which rival is most likely to suffer from Kasich\u2019s entrance into the race? Gotta be Walker given their similar experience/regional profiles, right? Imagine how grateful Jeb will be if Kasich gets in and manages to siphon off just enough votes from the guy from Wisconsin to allow Bush to win the nomination. A Bush/Kasich ticket is a cinch, right? Get excited, conservatives!\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "In.", "title": "ABC: John Kasich \u201cvirtually certain\u201d to run for president", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2015/05/18/abc-john-kasich-is-virtually-certain-to-run-for-president/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary", "creator": "@allahpundit"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "article": {"published_time": "2015-05-18T15:21:26+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-05-18T15:16:40+00:00"}, "keywords": "debates, GOP, John Kasich, Medicaid, Ohio, poor, President, republican,", "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb850\"", "article_summary": "As a Republican elected twice as governor of the critical battleground state of Ohio, Kasich is a potentially formidable candidate.\nAnd then there were 237:John Kasich is \u201cvirtually certain\u201d to jump into the race for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination, sources close to the Ohio governor tell ABC News.\nKasich has said his wife and daughters have given him a green light to run and in recent days Kasich has told his political advisors to begin preparing for a likely campaign.\nIf he makes the final decision to run, he will make the announcement in late June or July.\nKasich travels to New Hampshire in early June and recently did a fundraising trip to California."}
