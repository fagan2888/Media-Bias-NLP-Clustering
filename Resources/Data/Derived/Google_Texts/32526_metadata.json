As they approached Union Station, Brown realized it wasn\u2019t a film they were headed to, but rather a glimpse of her past.\n\nBrown worked for years as a secretary for the Colorado Bureau of Investigation \u2014 a job she admits she didn\u2019t love \u2014 at an office just down the hall from where Phil Anschutz, who later became a billionaire, began his empire in the station. When Brown\u2019s daughter heard that the newly remodeled station would be opening to the public Saturday, she soon knew she wanted to bring her mother back.\n\nAs Brown, born just a few years after Union Station first opened, walked from the sweltering heat into the cool air inside the new station, what she initially viewed as a sour surprise quickly became a happy trip down memory lane. Lifting her head upward, she smiled.\n\n\u201cJust like another century,\u201d she said, looking at the pristine white ceiling over the new shops and hotel. \u201cThey\u2019ve done a beautiful job.\u201d\n\nMemories were plentiful Saturday morning as the refurbished station officially opened its doors to the public. Thousands flocked to the blocked-off streets around the area where food carts, music, beer and ice cream stood ready for excited patrons.\n\nWhile the station in recent weeks has been the scene of several exclusive \u2014 and expensive \u2014 private openings, Saturday was the public\u2019s turn to marvel at the new transportation and social hub.\n\n\u201cBack to the future,\u201d Dana Crawford, the iconic Denver developer responsible for much of the renovation of the new station, said to those waiting to enter the building. \u201cFor the next 99 years, it\u2019s all yours.\u201d\n\nAnd with an air-conditioned blast of cool breeze, dozens briskly entered the new station.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s exciting today to open these doors to the people of Colorado,\u201d Crawford told The Denver Post as many approached to thank her for her work and commitment to the city. \u201cIt\u2019s really their place.\u201d\n\nJesse Paul: 303-954-1733, jpaul@ denverpost.com or twitter.com/jesseapaul", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda488\"", "article_summary": "As they approached Union Station, Brown realized it wasn\u2019t a film they were headed to, but rather a glimpse of her past.\n\u201cThey\u2019ve done a beautiful job.\u201dMemories were plentiful Saturday morning as the refurbished station officially opened its doors to the public.\nWhen the 94-year-old\u2019s daughter knocked on the door of her Lakewood home, Brown thought they were headed to a movie.\nWhen Brown\u2019s daughter heard that the newly remodeled station would be opening to the public Saturday, she soon knew she wanted to bring her mother back.\n\u201cFor the next 99 years, it\u2019s all yours.\u201dAnd with an air-conditioned blast of cool breeze, dozens briskly entered the new station."}
