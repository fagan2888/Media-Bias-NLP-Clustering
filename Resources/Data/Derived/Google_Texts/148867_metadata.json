Not all of these individuals, policy makers and entrepreneurs are household names, but they all are improving this country by developing new ways to solve America\u2019s biggest challenges. Here, NationSwell\u2019s favorite solutions of the year.\n\nTHE GUTSY DAD THAT STARTED A BUSINESS TO HELP HIS SON FIND PURPOSE\n\nEighty percent of the workers at Rising Tide Car Wash, located in Parkland, Fla., are on the autism spectrum. Started by the father-and-son team of John and Tom D\u2019Eri, Rising Tide gives their son and brother, Andrew, who was identified as an autistic individual at the age of three, and its other employees the chance to lead a fulfilling life. John and Tom determined that the car wash industry is a good match for those with autism since they\u2019re more likely to be engaged by detailed, repetitive processes than those not on the spectrum. YouTube\n\nTHE ALLSTARS THAT ARE TACKLING SOME OF AMERICA\u2019S GREATEST CHALLENGES\n\nThe six NationSwell AllStars \u2014 Karen Washington, Eli Williamson, Rinku Sen, Seth Flaxman, DeVone Boggan and Amy Kaherl \u2014 are encouraging advancements in education and environmental sustainability, making government work better for its citizens, engaging people in national service, advancing the American dream and supporting our veterans.

NationSwell pieced together the story of how a land battle and a statewide tax revolt altered the course of Boone County. Find out exactly how it happened here.

But Wrightspeed, which is installing range-extended electric powertrains (the generators that electric vehicles run on) in medium- and heavy-duty trucks for companies like the Ratto Group, Sonoma and Marin counties\u2019 waste hauler, and shipping giant FedEx, could have a greater impact on the environment than electrifying personal vehicles.

Herman for NationSwell\n\nTHE ORGANIZATION THAT IS TURNING A NOTORIOUS PROJECT INTO AN URBAN VILLAGE\n\nLos Angeles\u2019s large, 700-unit public housing development Jordan Downs consists of 103 identical buildings. Entryways to the two-story beige structures are darkened with black soot and grime, and the doors and windows are crossed with bars. Soon, the dilapidated complex will be revitalized by Joseph Paul, Jr., and his outreach team from SHIELDS for Families, which provides counseling, education and vocational training services. Read more about the plan, which calls for recreational parks and retail on site and would double the amount of available housing with 700 more units tiered at affordable and market rates.

Since 2002, Pallister\u2019s organization, Gulf of Alaska Keeper, has been actively cleaning beaches in Prince William Sound and the Northern Gulf Coast. The nonprofit\u2019s five boats, seasonal crew of 12 and dozens of regular volunteers has removed an estimated 2.5 million pounds of marine debris (mostly plastic items washed ashore from the Great Pacific Garbage Patch) from more than 1,500 miles of coastline. YouTube\n\nTHE STATE THAT\u2019S ENDING HOMELESSNESS WITH ONE SIMPLE IDEA\n\nUtah set the ambitious goal to end homelessness in 2015. As the state\u2019s decade-long \u201cHousing First\u201d program, an initiative to place the homeless into supportive housing without any prerequisites, wraps up this year, it\u2019s already reduced chronic homelessness (those with deeper disabling conditions, like substance abuse or schizophrenia, who had been on the streets for a year or longer or four times within three years) by 72 percent and is on track to end it altogether by early next year. Read more about the initiative here.

So he\u2019s turned a two-story building that was destroyed by catastrophic flooding during Hurricane Katrina in 2005 (along with most of the Lower 9th Ward community) into a shopping plaza. Already, he\u2019s opened a barbershop, a convenience store, and a full-service grocery store in a neighborhood that has been identified as a food desert. YouTube\n\nTHE MAN THAT\u2019S GIVING CAREERS TO UNEMPLOYED MILITARY VETERANS\n\n\u201cThey had our backs, let\u2019s keep the shirts on theirs\u201d is more than just a motto for Mark Doyle. It\u2019s the business model on which he built Rags of Honor, his silk-screen printing company based in Chicago that provides employment and other services to veterans. In the three years since its inception, Rags of Honor has grown from four employees to 22, all but one of whom are veterans at high risk of homelessness. YouTube\n\nTHE PRESIDENT THAT\u2019S PRESERVING OUR ENVIRONMENT FOR FUTURE GENERATIONS\n\nAfter promising to slow the rise of the oceans and to heal our planet during his 2008 campaign, President Barack Obama has faltered on environmental legislation during his first term, preferring to expend his political capital on the Affordable Care Act. But the 44th president\u2019s use of regulatory authority and his agreement with China likely ensure his place in the pantheon of modern environmental champions. Here\u2019s why.
