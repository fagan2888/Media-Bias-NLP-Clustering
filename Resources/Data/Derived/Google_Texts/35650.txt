Louisiana Commissioner of Insurance Jim Donelon announced Friday that workers' compensation insurance rates will decrease by 5.1 percent in the state, effective May 1, 2014.

Donelon approved the decrease after the National Council on Compensation Insurance (NCCI) recommended Louisiana cut workers' compensation rates by 5 percent because of improved workplace safety, fewer injuries in the workplace and less severe injuries across most employment divisions.

“The reduction in the cost of workers’ compensation insurance is good news for our state’s business community as businesses continue to struggle faced with new mandatory health insurance provisions of the Affordable Care Act and with recovery efforts since the national economic recession of 2008,” said Commissioner Donelon. “Louisiana’s workers’ compensation insurance market is competitive and showing signs of improvement, especially in the area of improved worker safety.”

NCCI typically analyzes workers' compensation data and files loss costs or rates in 35 states. Most workers’ compensation carriers in Louisiana use the NCCI annual loss cost filing to calculate their insurance rates.

The most recent decrease in workers' compensation loss costs was at 4.3 percent in 2010. The 5.1 percent drop marks a cumulative 35-percent drop since 2004.

According to the Louisiana Department of Insurance, the top five workers’ compensation insurance writers in Louisiana in 2012 were Louisiana Workers’ Compensation Corporation with 21.0 percent, Liberty Mutual Group at 12.6 percent, LUBA Casualty Insurance Co. with 8.8 percent, American International Group at 7.4 percent and Zurich Group with 7.2 percent. Louisiana's total workers’ compensation market is estimated to be about $900 million in total premium.
