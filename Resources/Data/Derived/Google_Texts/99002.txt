LLR Partners Acquires Majority Stake in Disaster Recovery Business Agility

The business was carved out of GE in 2001 by Generation Partners, which retains a minority stake

Philadelphia private equity firm LLR Partners has acquired a majority stake in Agility Recovery, a disaster recovery business.

Agility, headquartered in Charlotte, N.C., provides businesses temporary power, Internet and phone communication, computer and office equipment and temporary office space after a disaster or other business interruption. Employees of Agility clients can also use the service to handle situations at home surrounding a disaster. Terms of the investment were not disclosed.

Generation Partners, a Greenwich, Connecticut-based private equity firm that invested in Agility in 2001, remains a minority shareholder. The firm bought Agility from General Electric (NYSE: GE).

LLR is a middle-market private equity firm that invests in business services, consumer, education, financial services, health care services, security and information technology services. In October, the firm bought a stake in Phreesia Payment Services, and before that, invested $20 million in technology-services company Aasonn LLC.

Golub Capital provided debt financing for the deal, and Raymond James acted as Agility's financial adviser.

Other firms have also taken an interest in disaster recovery businesses. Private equity firm the Riverside Co. has been building up one of its portfolio companies, Emergency Communications Network Inc. since 2011.
