In the previous SNL episode, Kerry Washington showed us what a gifted dramatic actress is capable of doing with comedy \u2014 even during the show\u2019s more sluggish moments. Gaga followed suit \u2014 for the most part. She\u2019s a true performer who has carefully crafted her image, but last night proved that self-aware, goofy side is still there \u2014 at least until the strangest sketch of the evening introduced us to a Norma Desmond-ized version of the singer. We feature it all past the break, along with both musical performances. R. Kelly joined Gaga for \u201cDo What U Want\u201d (doing his best pervy calisthenics routine), and \u201cGypsy\u201d featured a ridiculously excited tambourine player in purple pants. What more could we ask for?\n\nThe Best\n\n\u201cLady Gaga Monologue\u201d\n\nGaga doesn\u2019t make the people wait for what they want. Channeling her inner flapper with a fringy costume, she goes right into a reworking of \u201cApplause\u201d (complete with backup dancers) that reminds us of her theater background. It\u2019s a fun introduction with brief audience interaction. I didn\u2019t anticipate a traditional monologue, and thankfully Gaga doesn\u2019t rely solely on her singing to charm us.\n\n\u201cAnti-Depressant for Obama\u201d\n\nDepression meds to help you feel like \u201cyou\u2019re giving a speech at a college campus in 2008!\u201d I think we\u2019re all thankful for the ObamaCare website mess since SNL\u2019s take on our current president\u2019s administration hasn\u2019t been the strongest. This one isn\u2019t anything to write home about, but it\u2019s better than most of the Obama cold opens.\n\n\u201cWaking Up with Kimye\u201d\n\nSNL seems to be relying far too much on letting its guest hosts break the fourth wall with a wink (like Miley) or a fluttering of the eyelashes (like Gaga this week) in order for the audience to get the gag. A little of that goes a long way, and I\u2019d rather see the funny in the writing and acting \u2014 but Gaga gets a chance to address criticism about her outrageous wardrobe. I\u2019m always happy to see Nasim Pedrad and Jay Pharoah early in the evening, and their impression of the celebrity couple is spot-on.\n\n\u201cWorst Cover Songs of All Time\u201d\n\nThe cast trots out their best impressions for this worst cover songs of all time sketch, hosted by Taran Killam\u2019s Adam Duritz from Counting Crows. We get Britney singing Leonard Cohen\u2019s \u201cHallelujah,\u201d Rick Ross doing Anna Kendrick\u2019s \u201cCups\u201d from Pitch Perfect, and Lana Del Rey and Nathan Lane covering Shaggy\u2019s \u201cIt Wasn\u2019t Me.\u201d Gaga addresses the criticism about \u201cBorn This Way\u201d sounding like Madonna\u2019s \u201cExpress Yourself\u201d two years too late, but I\u2019ll take it.\n\n\u201cWeekend Update: Mr. Senior and Jebidiah Atkinson\u201d\n\nMore stuff like this, \u201cWeekend Update.\u201d Kenan Thompson\u2019s Mr. Senior is cranky about society\u2019s obsession with Christmas celebrations starting immediately after Halloween. (We feel you.) The sketch heads to the streets outside, which is a nice change of pace. Taran Killam\u2019s bitchy speech critic, who poo-pooed the Gettysburg Address in his latest write-up, wins the evening. He recovers from a hiccup line delivery beautifully, and I hope this isn\u2019t the last we\u2019ll see of this character.\n\n\u201cSpotlightz Acting Camp\u201d\n\nWe get cheerful kids reenacting famous scenes from Hollywood films to the best of their ability. Gaga\u2019s Disney-fied version of the foul-mouthed Training Day speech is nail-biting. I was almost positive she was going to accidentally slip and drop an \u201cF\u201d bomb, but she\u2019s as composed as ever like a true professional.\n\n\u201cBlockbuster\u201d\n\nThe pre-recorded segments have been interesting if nothing else. SNL seems to be taking these as opportunities to insert a little quiet and weird into the mix. This goodbye to video store titan Blockbuster shows off what the series can do production-wise when allowed the mystique of the editing room.\n\n\u201c4th Grade Talent Show\u201d\n\nJohn Milhiser? who\u2019s that guy? Oh right, one of the six new cast members who has faded into the background. Thankfully he shines as the proud stage father of a fourth-grader named Ashley. Gaga stars as her overzealous mom. The premise is simple, but fantastic, as the couple gets way too into their daughter\u2019s performance. Clothes come off, flexible limbs are stretched to the limit, and Gaga reminds us that she doesn\u2019t need a dress made of meat to shine. Like her stripped-down piano performances, she can do a lot with very little.\n\n\u201cUpper West Side 2063\u201d\n\nThis late-in-the-episode scene took a dark turn. I\u2019m not sure it was entirely successful as an SNL sketch, but it was compelling in that context. The audience wasn\u2019t sure whether to clap or feel bad for this Norma Desmond version of Gaga, who sits alone in her Upper West Side apartment in the year 2063. She masks her desperation to connect with someone by calling the landlord (Kenan Thompson) to change a light bulb (that doesn\u2019t actually need to be replaced). Thompson\u2019s character can\u2019t recall any of the work the older Gaga has done, despite her best attempts to remind him. It ends with a mobile sculpture (or a futuristic metronome?) on her piano slowly clapping, and the unexpected pathos of this sketch leaves everyone wondering what the hell just happened. I expect to see a lot more written about this one in the coming week.\n\nThe Worst\n\n\u201cRob Ford Cold Open\u201d\n\nBobby Moynihan does just fine as drug-addled Toronto mayor Rob Ford, but his Chris Farley-esque fall through the podium was the best thing this sketch had going on.\n\n\u201cCo-op Board\u201d\n\nSex jokes that are dead in the water, and inside jokes about New York City-living that most of America won\u2019t be able to appreciate. Gaga\u2019s Marisa Tomei impression isn\u2019t too shabby, though.\n\n\u201cRos\u00e9 Zone\u201d\n\nMaybe it was the placement of the sketch after such a somber imagining of Gaga\u2019s future, but \u201cRos\u00e9 Zone\u201d felt like a bit we\u2019ve seen a thousand times \u2014 one that would have been funnier when reality television was just starting to be a thing.\n\nMusical Performances", "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "We already knew that Gaga wasn\u2019t afraid to poke fun at herself after her appearances on SNL in 2009 and 2011, but we\u2019ve been discussing the performer\u2019s progressive grip (strangulation) on her public image and her desire to be taken seriously as an artist, so there was some uncertainty as to ho...", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "Flavorwire", "description": "We already knew that Gaga wasn\u2019t afraid to poke fun at herself after her appearances on SNL in 2009 and 2011, but we\u2019ve been discussing the performer\u2019s progressive grip (strangulation) on her publi\u2026", "title": "The Best and Worst of Last Night\u2019s \u2018SNL\u2019 with Lady Gaga", "url": "http://flavorwire.com/425557/the-best-and-worst-of-last-nights-snl-with-lady-gaga", "image": {"width": 480, "identifier": "https://flavorwire.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/gaga.png", "height": 268}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://flavorwire.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/gaga.png?w=640"}, "site": "@flavorwire", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@flavorwire"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#ffffff", "p": {"domain_verify": "d14fb4bfdccbc45ec9b9cf467123426d"}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://flavorwire.com/feed;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/5af1ea63c8deb1c43404735fce2401ed?s=16", "application-name": "Flavorwire", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/WordPresscom", "published_time": "2013-11-17T16:03:56+00:00", "modified_time": "2013-11-17T16:15:29+00:00"}, "keywords": "television, artpop, lady gaga, music, r. kelly, saturday night live, snl, snl recap", "google-site-verification": "LEPlfEAe87ZYYO-w5cvjSSIHi6-qE8orVaxsi6TkE9Y", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/flavorwire-2016/img/ms-icon-144x144.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0cb2\"", "article_summary": "I didn\u2019t anticipate a traditional monologue, and thankfully Gaga doesn\u2019t rely solely on her singing to charm us.\nI\u2019m not sure it was entirely successful as an SNL sketch, but it was compelling in that context.\nThompson\u2019s character can\u2019t recall any of the work the older Gaga has done, despite her best attempts to remind him.\nThe Best\u201cLady Gaga Monologue\u201dGaga doesn\u2019t make the people wait for what they want.\nR.
