That\u2019s because in his majority opinion, Justice Antonin Scalia abandons his claim that policies that are not intended to discriminate on religious grounds cannot be held to be discriminatory.\n\nBack in 1990, Scalia set Free Exercise jurisprudence on its ear when, in Employment Division v. Smith, he rounded up four other justices behind the position that individuals could not claim a violation of their constitutional right to free exercise against a \u201cneutral law of general applicability\u201d \u2014 that is, against a law that does not aim to discriminate against a religious practice and which applies to everyone.\n\nIn EEOC v. Abercrombie, Scalia wrote for a nearly unanimous court in favor of the view that Abercrombie\u2019s preppy dress code, which precluded headgear-wearing employees (i.e. a neutral and generally applicable rule), violated Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act when it was used to deny employment to a Muslim woman who was understood to be wearing a headscarf for religious reasons. Justice Samuel Alito, who\u2019s made something of a career of pushing back against Smith, went further than the rest of the majority, taking the position that \u201can employer\u2019s failure to make a reasonable accommodation is not an element that the plaintiff must prove\u201d; i.e. that there was no need to show that Abercrombie managers were aware of the religious basis of the would-be employee\u2019s attire.\n\nAs Noah Feldman acidly points out in a good discussion of the decision over at Bloomberg, \u201cTo understand why Scalia didn\u2019t want to go as far as Alito, you have to think back to when conservatives didn\u2019t like minorities, including religious minorities, to seek exemptions from general rules.\u201d That was then. Now we are in an era when the religious minorities are Catholic and evangelical Protestant individuals and institutions that want exemptions from neutral and generally applicable health insurance and anti-discrimination laws. The Religious Freedom Restoration Acts, about which there has been such fuss lately, would never have been put in place but for Smith.\n\nIn Abercrombie, the only dissenter was Clarence Thomas, who maintained the old Scalia line: \u201cUnlike the majority, I adhere to what I had thought before today was an undisputed proposition: Mere application of a neutral policy cannot constitute \u2018intentional discrimination.'\u201d To be sure, Scalia did not abandon his position on neutrality in so many words, writing: \u201cAbercrombie\u2019s argument that a neutral policy cannot constitute \u2018intentional discrimination\u2019 may make sense in other contexts.\u201d But Thomas didn\u2019t doubt, nor should we, that Scalia and almost all his colleagues have turned their backs on the Smith rule.\n\nThe question is: When will they apply their new/old understanding of religious discrimination to the First Amendment itself? Thus far, conservatives on the Court seem to have been reluctant to reverse Smith for fear of offending Scalia. Now that he\u2019s given up the fight, the reversal could come as early as this month, when the justices deliver their much-awaited final word on same-sex marriage.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Ethics, Opinion, religious liberty", "generator": "Easy Digital Downloads v2.5.16", "og": {"site_name": "Religion News Service", "description": "With big implications for the future of religious free exercise.", "title": "Scalia does a u-turn on religious liberty", "url": "http://religionnews.com/2015/06/02/scalia-does-a-u-turn-on-religious-liberty/", "image": "http://religionnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Abercrombie.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@RNS", "card": "summary", "creator": "@directorsilk"}, "syndication-source": "http://religionnews.com/2015/06/02/scalia-does-a-u-turn-on-religious-liberty/", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://religionnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-RNS_logo_RGB-336x336.gif", "original-source": "http://religionnews.com/2015/06/02/scalia-does-a-u-turn-on-religious-liberty/", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "description": "With big implications for the future of religious free exercise."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9a92\"", "article_summary": "In EEOC v.
