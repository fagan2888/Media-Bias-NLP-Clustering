The drug, MannKind's Afrezza, is an insulin powder meant to be inhaled before eating a meal.\n\nAfrezza provides a fast-acting form of insulin that targets adults with type 2 diabetes, the most common form of the disease. Though the drug has been waiting for three years to be approved, the FDA didn\u2019t make it official until Friday.\n\n\u201cAfrezza is a new treatment option for patients with diabetes requiring mealtime insulin,\u201d Jean-Marc Guettier, director of the Division of Metabolism and Endocrinology Products in the FDA\u2019s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, said in a press release. \u201cToday\u2019s approval broadens the options available for delivering mealtime insulin in the overall management of patients with diabetes who require it to control blood sugar levels.\u201d\n\nIn order to test the drug, the FDA studied its efficacy on a total of 3,017 study participants, of whom 1,991 had type 2 diabetes.\n\nOver 25 million Americans suffer from type 2 diabetes. The prevalence of diabetes continues to grow, hand-in-hand with unhealthy, sedentary lifestyles, and obesity across the U.S. and the whole world. Over 347 million people worldwide have diabetes, according to the World Health Organization (WHO), and this number is expected to balloon in coming years. As a result, the demand for diabetes treatment is also growing.\n\nCurrently, most diabetes patients use an insulin shot in order to get their insulin levels up to speed, but the injection can take up to an hour and a half or longer to begin working. The inhalable insulin, on the other hand, could help reach peak insulin levels within 12 to 15 minutes. However, the FDA notes that Afrezza isn\u2019t a substitute for long-acting insulin, but instead, is merely an option to control insulin levels during eating. In addition, the FDA warns that the drug shouldn\u2019t be used by people who suffer from chronic lung diseases like smoker\u2019s cough or asthma, due to reports of breathing spasms.\n\nAccording to the FDA press release, further studies will need to be conducted in order to be completely safe about Afrezza\u2019s effects on cardiovascular and pulmonary health. The following studies will need to be completed:", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "insulin, diabetes, afrezza", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "The FDA has finally approved a new diabetes drug that can be inhaled before or after eating, and can help patients control their blood sugar.", "title": "An Inhalable Diabetes Drug Is On The Way", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/fda-approves-new-diabetes-drug-afrezza-inhalable-insulin-helps-diabetics-control-blood-sugar-290500", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/28/diabetes-injection.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The FDA has finally approved a new diabetes drug that can be inhaled before or after eating, and can help patients control their blood sugar.", "title": "An Inhalable Diabetes Drug Is On The Way", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/fda-approves-new-diabetes-drug-afrezza-inhalable-insulin-helps-diabetics-control-blood-sugar-290500", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/28/diabetes-injection.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/28/diabetes-injection.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Drugs", "published_time": "2014-06-28T19:07:17-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-06-28T19:07:17-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "The FDA has finally approved a new diabetes drug that can be inhaled before or after eating, and can help patients control their blood sugar."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fccf9c\"", "article_summary": "The FDA has finally approved a new diabetes drug that can be inhaled before or after eating, and can help patients control their blood sugar.\nThe Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved a new diabetes medication that will help diabetics monitor their blood sugar levels.\nThe inhalable insulin, on the other hand, could help reach peak insulin levels within 12 to 15 minutes.\nHowever, the FDA notes that Afrezza isn\u2019t a substitute for long-acting insulin, but instead, is merely an option to control insulin levels during eating.\nAfrezza provides a fast-acting form of insulin that targets adults with type 2 diabetes, the most common form of the disease."}
