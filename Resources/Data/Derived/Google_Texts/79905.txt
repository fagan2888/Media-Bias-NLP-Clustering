Cole Hefner has announced the endorsement of Rep. Bryan Hughes in his race for House District 5.

Hughes has represented House District 5 in the Texas Legislature since he was elected in 2002. He has been widely regarded as one of the most conservative leaders in the Texas House.

"In case there is any question about this, my vote and my endorsement in House District 5 goes to Cole Hefner," said Hughes. "He is the one we can count on to fight Obamacare, secure the border, fight for religious freedom and stand up to the federal government."

Hughes made the announcement at a get-out-the-vote rally earlier this week. You can see the video here: https://www.youtube.com/ watch?v=F3HCHqoCdkA

"I am honored that Bryan Hughes would endorse me to replace him in the Texas House," said Hefner. "I will have big shoes to fill, but I look forward to providing conservative representation to the people of District 5."

In addition to Representative Hughes, Hefner has been endorsed by Texas Right to Life, Texans for Fiscal Responsibility, Grassroots America - We the People, Conservative Republicans of Texas, Young Conservatives of Texas, Concerned Women for America LAC, Texas Farm Bureau, Texas Values Action, East Texas Police Chiefs Association, Comptroller Glenn Hegar, David Barton (President, Wallbuilders), Cathie Adams (Former Chair, Texas GOP), and conservative leaders from across the district and state.
