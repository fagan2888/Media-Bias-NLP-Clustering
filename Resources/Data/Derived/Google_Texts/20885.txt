Kemper County leaders say the future of the area is looking up. District 2 Supervisor Johnny Whitsett says the business brought in from the Kemper Coal Plant is helping bring about major economic changes.

"We've got a chance to lower our millage," Whitsett says. "We've got a chance to do some other things inside the county. We're hoping that things, as far as economic development, is going to pick up. We had a trip to Washington last week, and things are looking good for Kemper County."

The idea is to keep the momentum from the coal plant going. Executive Director of the Kemper County Economic Development Authority Craig Hitt says the county has hired a consultant to show them how to best work with this increase in industry and population.

"It's going to give us an opportunity to prepare Kemper County for additional growth in the future that they just haven't been able to prepare for in the past," Hitt says. "But now they have a tax base that gives them something to work with."

County administrator Andrew Smith has a background in government management. He says the coal plant has given the county new opportunities, but altogether, Kemper is now facing many challenges similar to other counties.

"I like to say that Kemper County is pregnant with possibility," Smith says. "It's really a great place to live, a great place to work. I really think that our future is bright."

County leaders hope the consultant can bring in ideas on how to keep business thriving.
