Today she is stable condition after a 27-pound tumor was removed from her abdomen in an 8.5 hour surgery performed at Emory Hospital.\n\nAt first, Lewis did not know she had a growing tumor \u2014 she thought she was just gaining weight. Shortly after the discovery of the mass, she lost her husband, then lost her insurance. Doctors say that by the time she went to the hospital, removal of the mass was imperative. Doctors agreed to operate on Lewis even though she was uninsured.\n\n\u201cThis thing was going to continue to grow,\u201d says Dr. Alan Gordon of Emory Hospital.\u201dThe good news for her was that even though it had grown a significant size, it had been doing this slowly.\u201d\n\nLewis\u2019 friends and family were concerned for her.\n\n\u201cIt was very frightening, seeing her sick, seeing her throwing up, seeing this thing in her stomach that we had no idea about being there,\u201d says daughter Sarina Lewis.\n\nDoris Lewis is expected to be back on her feet by Wednesday.\n\nMeanwhile, across the country an Arizona woman named Marcey DiCaro was finally able to get a 47-pound tumor removed from her abdomen with the help of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe University of Arizona was able to perform the lifesaving surgery on DiCaro due to her recently acquired Obamacare insurance. The University of Arizona Hospital released this statement:\n\n\u201cDiCaro, who had no health insurance at the time of diagnosis, had a scan that revealed a large tumor in March 2012\u2026Finally, in 2014, DiCaro was able to acquire insurance coverage that would cover preexisting conditions through the Affordable Care Act. She underwent surgery April 17. By then, surgery had become more complicated with the growth of the tumor and the involvement of other organs.\u201d\n\nOne of DiCaro\u2019s kidneys had to be removed because it was totally encased by the massive tumor. She underwent 10 hours of surgery and suffered cardiac arrest during the procedure.\n\n\u201cIf the tumor had been let go, it would have killed me,\u201d DiCaro said.\n\nWe\u2019ve said it before and we\u2019ll say it again: thank goodness for the Affordable Care Act.\n\nSOURCE: USAToday, UnitedPressInternational | VIDEO SOURCE: YouTube\n\nAlso On Global Grind:", "article_metadata": {"pubexchange": {"headline": "So This Happened: Two Women Get Massive 27 & 47 Pound Tumors Removed (GRAPHIC)", "image": "https://ioneglobalgrind.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/doctor_sued_0.jpg?w=540&h=320&crop=1", "description": "A month ago,\u00a0Doris Lewis\u00a0of Atlanta entered the hospital after experiencing shortness of breath.
