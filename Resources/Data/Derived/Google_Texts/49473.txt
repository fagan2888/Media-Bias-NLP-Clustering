Labor Day, the first Monday in September set aside to honor the contributions of American workers. Most people spend this day taking a break from the daily grind of non-stop work.

"Everybody that works always earns Labor Day, because it's the only day of the year you get to take it easy," said Billy McInnis of Philadelphia.

Many people use this day off to spend a little extra time with loved ones.

"I like just spending my labor day with friends and family and just kicking it," said Melinda McInnis of Philadelphia.

Most of the businesses in Philadelphia are closed to honor Labor Day, giving most everyone a chance to get out and enjoy their day.

While Zaus Kirkland enjoys having some time to relax, his church spent the day enjoying some fun, food, and fellowship.

"We come together as a church picnic. We get together. We play softball, basketball, we throw the football. We just fellowship, you know team building, and that's what it means to me," said Zaus Kirkland of Philadelphia.

Kirkland says Labor Day is known in history as people being off work and taking a break, but to him it is so much more than taking it easy.

"People getting together enjoying fellowship, good times, good laughter," said Kirkland.

Oregon was the first state to make it a holiday in 1887. Labor Day became an official federal holiday in 1894.
