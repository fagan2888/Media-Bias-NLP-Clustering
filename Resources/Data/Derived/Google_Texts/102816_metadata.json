OK, what happened to the police officers? What happened to the looters? What about the fate of the hardworking shop owners whose businesses were destroyed? Has anybody reached out and helped? The media stirred the pot, they focused on the bad, they left us with a bitter, angry taste. They left us with this idea of what Ferguson is.\u201d\n\nHe spoke of the media\u2019s misrepresentation of a number of allegedly dangerous places like Jerusalem and Lebanon \u2014 when he traveled around the Middle East, he expected fires! Bombs! Terrorists in every bus! But, Beck comforts us, that is not so.\n\nThe same is true for Ferguson, Beck says. The media only portrayed a heightened, misleading version of the worst of what happened, while ignoring all the good that was done. He mentions the work his organization the Blaze did, and highlighted an article with my all-time favorite headline: \u201cAfter Hearing What a Tea Party Group Recently Did in Ferguson, You Likely Won\u2019t Be Surprised That You Haven\u2019t Heard About It.\u201d\n\nOnly the Blaze and Arianna Huffington, he oddly argues, have highlighted the good deeds coming out of Ferguson. \u201cYes, there were looters. Yes, there were vandals. Yes, there were bad cops. Yes, there were good cops! The good has far out-shadowed the bad. Teachers spent their day cleaning up trash. Arianna Huffington also pointed out the religious leaders and the churches that cleaned up and worked tirelessly urging people to be peaceful \u2026 Did you hear this in the mainstream media? I didn\u2019t. I didn\u2019t. I thought the Blaze quite frankly was alone for some time. No, it wasn\u2019t. I just didn\u2019t notice what Arianna was doing as well. Both were pointing out exactly who we are.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Glenn Beck asks why the media portrayed Ferguson as a town full of bad cops and looters; totally misses the mark VIDEO", "author": "Joanna Rothkopf", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Glenn Beck asks why the media portrayed Ferguson as a town full of bad cops and looters; totally misses the mark VIDEO", "title": "Glenn Beck\u2019s laughably absurd Ferguson claim: \u201cThe good has far out-shadowed the bad\u201d", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/09/05/glenn_becks_laughably_absurd_ferguson_claim_the_good_has_far_out_shadowed_the_bad/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/09/Screen-Shot-2014-09-05-at-11.23.43-AM1-1280x793.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Glenn Beck asks why the media portrayed Ferguson as a town full of bad cops and looters; totally misses the mark VIDEO", "creator": "@@joannarothkopf", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/09/Screen-Shot-2014-09-05-at-11.23.43-AM1-1280x793.png", "title": "Glenn Beck\u2019s laughably absurd Ferguson claim: \u201cThe good has far out-shadowed the bad\u201d", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Glenn Beck\u2019s laughably absurd Ferguson claim: \u201cThe good has far out-shadowed the bad\u201d", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Arianna Huffington, Ferguson, Glenn Beck, michael brown, Video", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe055e\"", "article_summary": "Topics: Arianna Huffington, Ferguson, Glenn Beck, michael brown, Video, Social News, Media News, News\u201cDo we even care, does the media care what was Ferguson really all about?\u201d Glenn Beck asked on the latest episode of the Blaze\u2019s Glenn Beck Program.\nThe same is true for Ferguson, Beck says.\nThe media only portrayed a heightened, misleading version of the worst of what happened, while ignoring all the good that was done.\nThe media stirred the pot, they focused on the bad, they left us with a bitter, angry taste.\nArianna Huffington also pointed out the religious leaders and the churches that cleaned up and worked tirelessly urging people to be peaceful \u2026 Did you hear this in the mainstream media?"}
