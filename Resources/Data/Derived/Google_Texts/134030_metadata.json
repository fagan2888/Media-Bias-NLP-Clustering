A recent study from the University of Rochester Medical Center reports the mice\u2019s newfound glial cells help support the neurons that produce thought.\n\nReplacing half a mouse\u2019s brain with human glial cells, the cells that support neurons with a protective substance called myelin, doesn\u2019t mean the mice are any more human, per se. Rather, researchers hope the advance will build on prior work that lets them understand more about diseases of the brain. Though cell cultures offer a certain degree of insight, the chance to see disease play out in more sophisticated models still reigns supreme.\n\n\u201cWe could see the human cells taking over the whole space,\u201d co-author Dr. Steven Goldman, professor of neurology at URMC, told New Scientist. \u201cIt seemed like the mouse counterparts were fleeing to the margins.\u201d\n\nGoldman and his team of colleagues initially incorporated 300,000 premature glial cells from donated human fetuses into the brains of ordinary lab mice. Within a year, the inaugural batch had multiplied to some 12 million cells, totally replacing the mice\u2019s former cells. The replacement yielded massive changes to the animals\u2019 cognitive output. With 100 times as many tendrils between synapses \u2014 the bridges between neurons \u2014 as the control mice, the humanized mice froze four times longer in response to a conditioned sound. Greater cognition made for stronger memory.\n\n\u201cThese were whopping effects,\" Goldman said. \u201cWe can say they were statistically and significantly smarter than control mice.\u201d\n\nMaking a comparison of intelligence isn\u2019t as cut and dry as a batch of cells may lead on. Intelligence is comprised of many factors, including reasoning ability, creativity, and pattern recognition \u2014 not just the strength of one\u2019s memory \u2014 so there are natural limits to the claim that the mice are smarter. But from a neurological perspective, many of the moving parts scientists conflate with intelligence did get beefed up.\n\nHuman astrocytes, for example, a type of glial cell, are 10 to 20 times larger than mouse glial cells. They can communicate signals far more quickly, Goldman says. \u201cIt's like ramping up the power of your computer.\u201d\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first study to make mice smarter with a little outside help. In 2013, Goldman first showed mature glial cells generate the effect. But that finding was limited in that the glial cells had already matured, so the team couldn\u2019t assess whether they interacted at all with the existing cells. In the new study, the research team relied on progenitor cells, which can divide and multiply until they run out of space. In parallel research, Goldman showed immature glial cells can transform into oligodendrocytes, which help restore the brain\u2019s supply of myelin.\n\nThe people most at-risk for myelin loss are those suffering from multiple sclerosis and other degenerative diseases. Goldman hopes to start a trial in 12 to 15 months that investigates progenitor glial cells\u2019 ability to restore the myelin sheaths. He's awaiting formal permission.\n\nIn the meantime, he and his colleagues are moving the experiments toward more advanced models. He has set his sights on rats, though he doubts they\u2019ll move much further. Monkeys and chimpanzees are probably a no-go, as toying with higher-order functions begins to introduce ethical concerns. Wolfgang Enard, of Ludwig-Maximilians University Munich in Germany, has expressed some doubts after having performed similar research.\n\n\u201cIf you make animals more human-like,\u201d he told New Scientist, \u201cwhere do you stop?\u201d\n\nSource: Windrem M, Schanz S, Morrow C, et al.
