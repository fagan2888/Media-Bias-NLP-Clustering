A minor increase in the state\u2019s General Excise Tax, a tax on all businesses\u2019 gross income, would underwrite the benefit. Hawaii\u2019s successful tourist industry would help boost the fund because tourists, who pay the General Excise Tax as well, would fund approximately 35% of the long-term care program but would never claim the benefit themselves.\n\nHawaii\u2019s proposed social insurance program would not cover the cost of assisted living or skilled nursing facilities, though it would offer more flexibility and money to families that are already providing long-term care, The American Prospect reported.\n\n\u201cOur target was to look at what it would cost to help someone get four hours of home or community care,\u201d Dr. Lawrence Nitz, a political science professor at the University of Hawaii at M\u0101noa who conducted research on long-term care financing for the state, explained to The American Prospect. \u201cSeventy dollars means you could plan to go to work, you could take time to meet your child\u2019s teacher. It\u2019s enough to help people avoid losing their jobs, while still balancing care responsibilities.\u201d\n\nThe bill\u2019s supporters have claimed its passage will help ease the financial burden on families caring for seniors, as well as create more high-quality home care jobs for the primarily women and immigrant workers who often fill these roles.\n\n\u201cHawaii has a tradition of being at the forefront of health care policy,\u201d Kevin Simowitz, the political director for Caring Across Generations, a national organization that aims to help people age with dignity and independence, told The American Prospect. \u201cLong before the Affordable Care Act, Hawaiians had a plan to make sure that workers had quality affordable health care. This would not be the first time they\u2019ve done something a little bit provocative and groundbreaking.\u201d\n\nWritten by Mary Kate Nelson\n\nPhoto courtesy John Morgan", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Home Health Care News", "description": "As the nation readies itself for an influx of aging baby boomers, guaranteed funding for a basic level of senior care may become a reality in at least one state this year.
