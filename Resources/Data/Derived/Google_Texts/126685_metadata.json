Rooks Jr.\n\nMedical providers who participate with Medicare should be aware of the federal False Claims Act (FCA) and the potential consequences for failing to follow its mandates. The FCA subjects a person or entity to liability for knowingly presenting, or causing the presentation of a false claim to the United States government for payment. A \u201ctraditional\u201d false claim involves the medical provider\u2019s receipt of a government payment as a result of the submission of a claim that was \u201cknowingly\u201d false.\n\nMedicare\u2019s payments to medical providers are conditioned on the provider\u2019s certification of compliance with Medicare\u2019s regulations. If payment is obtained based on the provider\u2019s false certification of compliance with Medicare\u2019s regulations, FCA liability is created. There are, however, other situations that may create liability under the FCA.\n\nIn contrast to the \u201ctraditional\u201d false claim, a \u201creverse\u201d false claim involves avoiding repayment to the government. The Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act, enacted in 2009, amended the False Claims Act, by expanding liability for \u201creverse\u201d false claims. As amended, the False Claims Act now imposes liability for knowingly concealing or knowingly and improperly avoiding or reducing an obligation to pay or transfer money back to the Government. The language \u201cavoiding an obligation\u201d to pay money to the government means that the provider has not returned an overpayment.\n\nEssentially, the provider has wrongfully retained funds that must be returned to the government. The amended statute specifically encompasses \u201cretention of an overpayment\u201d within the term \u201cobligation.\u201d Some examples of overpayments include Medicare\u2019s duplicate payment for a covered service, Medicare\u2019s incorrect application of a deductible or copayment, or Medicare erroneously pays the incorrect provider.\n\nThe Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) of 2010 further clarified reverse false claims. The term \u201coverpayment\u201d means any funds that a person or entity receives under the Medicare program to which that person or entity, after performing an applicable reconciliation, is not entitled. Section 6402(d) of the PPACA classifies overpayments as an \u201cobligation\u201d under the False Claims Act. Providers that receive Medicare overpayments must report the overpayment to the appropriate federal or state agency, intermediary, carrier or contractor.\n\nThe provider must also return the overpayment and provide an explanation of the reason for the overpayment. Providers are required to report and return overpayments within 60 days of an overpayment discovery. The PPACA expressly states that \u201c[a]ny overpayment retained by a person [or entity] after the deadline for reporting and returning the overpayment. . . is an obligation [under the False Claims Act].\u201d\n\nFalse claims liability is not solely conditioned upon fraudulently receiving payment from the government. It can also arise by failing to repay the government, even if the claim that triggered the government payment was itself not fraudulent. The FCA allows private parties, known as \u201cwhistleblowers\u201d to bring a \u201cqui tam\u201d action on behalf of herself/himself and the government.\n\nProviders would be wise to implement internal controls and systems to identify and avoid the risks that are associated with fraud and abuse under the FCA and PPACA. Because the FCA encompasses Medicare claims submissions which are made with reckless disregard for the truth (or falsity) of the information contained in the claim, medical providers should be vigilant, and pay close attention to how claims are submitted, and paid, or repaid, if necessary.\n\n###\n\nThe law practice established by Jared A.
