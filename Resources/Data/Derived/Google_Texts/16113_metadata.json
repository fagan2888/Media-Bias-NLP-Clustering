They needed to spend around $12,000 turning the empty metal box into a home.\n\nWhile it is still basic - the toilet consists of a composting bucket - the homes offer a surprising amount for such a tiny space.\n\nIseman's box boasts a custom-built shower, queen-size bed and glass windows while the solar panels allow him to power an adapted freezer. A giant roof top dish also gives him internet.\n\nFor just $600 a month, residents of Containertopia get a 160-square-foot metal box, which can be modified to include glass window, electricity and its own bathroom\n\nIt might not be luxurious but it's a bargain compared to the average rents in the city which have soared by 20 per cent in the last year to surpass even those in Manhattan\n\nContainertopia is a village of 160-square-foot shipping containers, based in Oakland, California\n\nCompact: The homes are tiny but are carefully configured to take advantage of every square inch of space\n\nCo-foudner Iseman said that the shipping containers were actually more suited for homes than anyone expected - as they were built to withstand long trips at sea in all weather\n\n'It's pretty much my dream, post-apocalyptic, cyber punk set up,' said Iseman, 32, who graduated from the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School and works in technology.\n\nHe added that the shipping containers were actually more suited for homes than expected - as they were built to withstand long trips at sea in all weather.\n\n'You have a watertight box that is way more structurally sound that you can possibly need. They have been stacked in hurricanes, in terms of a house they are way overkill.'\n\nThe former couple began buying more shipping containers to offer up as cheap rentals.\n\nTogether with a group of friends, they bought an abandoned lot for $425,000 as a haven for young professionals looking for an affordable way to live in one of the most expensive cities in the U.S.\n\nUnfortunately, Containertopia was not zoned for residential occupiers so when a neighbor complained last Spring, Iseman and Stewart were forced to move the containers into a warehouse.\n\nThe lot is currently being used to grow vegetables for the 'village'.\n\nBut Iseman still stands by Containertopia, and hopes to inspire others to follow his innovative solution to the housing crisis.\n\nFor Luke Iseman and Heather Stewart, the cost of renting just didn't add up.

She has since given up her job in digital design to manage the village full-time and has sold off most of her belongings to fit in her tiny home.\n\nSan Francisco's soaring rents have seen the cost of a one-bedroom apartment rocket to $3,500, according to Zumper \u2013 ahead of New York, where it costs $3,150 and twice the price as for the same type of property in Los Angeles.\n\nThe sky-high rents have forced many cash-strapped residents to get creative.\n\nFrom living on board sailboats and inside buses \u2013 to even piling into bunk beds \u2013 the extreme measures which young professionals have gone to in a bid to survive shows just how crippling the cost of living is in the Californian city.\n\nWhile one artist is creating miniature portable homes for those squeezed out the market altogether.\n\nGregory Kloehn has created colorful coffin-like sleeping boxes on wheels for Oakland's 3,000 homeless population. Each of the tiny homes is only eight feet long and just tall enough to sit up in.\n\nMade entirely from recycled materials and painted in eye-catching colorful designs, the artists has already created around 40 for those sleeping on the streets,\n\nThe median rent for a one-bedroom apartment in San Francisco is $3,500, twice as much as Los Angeles\n\nRent is so ridiculously expensive in San Francisco that residents have been forced to become creative with their living arrangements.

They've been making homes out of this stuff for a long time.'\n\nThe authorities have so far turned a blind eye to the portable homes - unlike in Los Angles where the city determined that another artist, Elvis Summers', portable homes for the homeless were illegal.\n\nFor young professionals in San Francisco, the movement towards tiny or unusual homes gives them freedom from renting in a city where some people pay as much as $550 to sleep six to a room in bunk beds.\n\nA posting on Craigslist \u2013 which has since been removed \u2013 advertised the room, above a Thai massage parlor, which also featured a table that seats two and a small oven and stove.\n\nLast year, CBS went undercover in the city's Mission District after the station was denied access to a house with 30 people living in it.\n\nThe new station asked a woman to tour the Victorian property advertised on Airbnb.\n\n'If I live there for five months, I'll hit break-even on the rent of the apartments I was looking at,' Carter said.

'It really is a steal.'\n\nMeanwhile, landscape architect Andreas Stavropoulos, 35, avoided paying extortionate rents for years and paid off his student loans by living economically in his Airstream.\n\nNow, he is offering the 15ft-long trailer to a tenant for $525 a month \u2013 a bargain considering the trailer was beautifully restored by Stavropoulos and comes complete with a bed and a desk.\n\nHowever, the catch is that prospective tenants would need their own place to park the trailer \u2013 ideally, close to a restroom.", "article_metadata": {"Rating": "General", "news_keywords": "The,600,month,shipping,container,village,young,professionals,getting,creative,avoid,staggering,rents,San,Francisco", "original-source": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3277963/The-600-month-shipping-container-village-young-professionals-getting-creative-avoid-staggering-rents-San-Francisco.html", "doc-class": "Living Document", "twitter": {"description": "San Francisco residents looking to avoid crippling costs of city living are flocking to Oakland where a strange shipping container village is growing.", "title": "Shipping container village for young professionals in San Francisco", "url": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3277963/The-600-month-shipping-container-village-young-professionals-getting-creative-avoid-staggering-rents-San-Francisco.html", "app": {"id": {"ipad": 400442503, "iphone": 384101264}}, "image": "http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2015/10/18/16/2D89145D00000578-0-image-a-25_1445181259374.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "account_id": 15438913}, "robots": "noodp,noydir,all,noarchive", "al": {"android": {"url": "dailymail-fb://article/3277963/", "app_name": "Daily Mail Online", "package": "com.dailymail.online"}, "ios": {"url": "dailymail-fb://article/3277963/", "app_store_id": 384101264, "app_name": "MailOnline"}}, "msvalidate.01": "12E6B4B813EB44C9BFC8F6A21F1D01F5", "fb": {"app_id": 146202712090395}, "MSSmartTagsPreventParsing": "true", "articleid": 3277963, "divclasspage": "articlePage", "keywords": "The,600,month,shipping,container,village,young,professionals,getting,creative,avoid,staggering,rents,San,Francisco", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/DailyMail", "published_time": "2015-10-18T14:51:05.000Zyyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss z", "author": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/search.html?s=&authornamef=Hannah+Parry+For+Dailymail.com", "section": "News", "modified_time": "2016-02-08T14:12:05.000Zyyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss z", "tag": "The 600 month shipping container village young professionals getting creative avoid staggering rents San Francisco"}, "verify-v1": "DXwlrsxbqxSv+FTFkWUfgflBvFJfx2YbNf/HmABrVyY=", "y_key": "1a7e912afbfcab2f", "og": {"site_name": "Mail Online", "description": "San Francisco residents looking to avoid crippling costs of city living are flocking to Oakland where a strange shipping container village is growing.", "title": "Shipping container village for young professionals in San Francisco", "url": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3277963/The-600-month-shipping-container-village-young-professionals-getting-creative-avoid-staggering-rents-San-Francisco.html", "image": {"width": 636, "identifier": "http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2015/10/18/16/2D89145D00000578-0-image-a-25_1445181259374.jpg", "height": 382}, "video": {"width": 636, "identifier": "http://video.dailymail.co.uk/video/1418450360/2013/01/1418450360_2112331866001_Micro-apartment.mp4", "type": "video/mp4", "height": 358}, "type": "article"}, "channel": "News", "description": "San Francisco residents looking to avoid crippling costs of city living are flocking to Oakland where a strange shipping container village is growing."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca2f1\"", "article_summary": "Residents looking to avoid crippling costs of city living, have flocked to Oakland where a bizarre shipping container village is growing.\nBut Iseman still stands by Containertopia, and hopes to inspire others to follow his innovative solution to the housing crisis.\nFor just $600 a month, residents of Containertopia get a 160-square-foot metal box, which can be modified to include glass window, electricity and its own bathroom.\nHowever, the catch is that prospective tenants would need their own place to park the trailer \u2013 ideally, close to a restroom.\nWhile it is still basic - the toilet consists of a composting bucket - the homes offer a surprising amount for such a tiny space."}
