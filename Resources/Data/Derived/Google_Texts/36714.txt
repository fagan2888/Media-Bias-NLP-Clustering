SPRINGFIELD, Mo-- “They are forcing us to be a part of a process that makes us complicit with the provision of abortaficient drugs which we find morally wrong," says College of the Ozarks President Jerry C. Davis.

Back in 2012 the college of the Ozarks filed a lawsuit that attempted to gain the university an exemption from the affordable care acts mandated coverage of birth control. That suit was then put on a type of legal pause called an abeyance.

But today the university’s president filed a brief, or a legal statement of support, in a series of cases currently facing the supreme court that are also looking to gain exemption due to their religious beliefs. If the Supreme Court sides with the religious institutions seeking exemption the College of the Ozarks says they will likely get an exemption as well.

“If the Supreme Court rules that the mandate is a substantial burden on religious organizations, the game is over,” Lewis says.

Kevin Pybas is a constitutional law professor at Missouri State University. We asked him how much of an impact the College of the Ozarks’s brief would have on the legal battle the other religious institutions are fighting against the Affordable Care Act.

“Well it will certainly have an impact. But it’s not their case. They have their own separate case but it is going to be affected by whatever the Supreme Court does in this case, on which, [The College of the Ozarks] is weighing their views,” says Pybas.

President Davis’s brief states that the penalties facing employers that refuse to cooperate with the Affordable Care Act’s mandates could cost the college up to 100 dollars a day for each employee, totaling a 10,000,000 dollar annual fee for not following the Obamacare mandate. Lewis says these penalties are “draconian”.

“We live in America. We don’t live in North Korea or somewhere. I think we are being treated like we are slaves of the state. And we are being told that we can’t honor our own religious convictions,” said Lewis.
