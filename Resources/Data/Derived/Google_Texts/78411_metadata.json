Monte and Renee R. Ellis.\n\nSEE ALSO: California Gov. Brown signs bill deleting \u2018husband,\u2019 \u2018wife\u2019 from marriage law\n\n\u201cResearch shows that women with a nonmarital first birth are both less likely to ever marry and less likely to remain married if they do marry,\u201d it said. Childbearing outside of marriage is also linked to higher risks for poverty, lower educational attainment and family instability.\n\nThe new report, \u201cFertility of Women in the United States: 2012,\u201d looks at first births and fertility patterns in women in 2012 as well as previous time periods.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to track these changes in fertility because recent research suggests that childbearing is related to women\u2019s rates of employment, their educational attainment and their economic well-being,\u201d said Ms. Monte.\n\nSEE ALSO: EDITORIAL: Justice Sotomayor and the phony \u2018war on women\u2019\n\nThe report finds that most American women still are married when they give birth to their first child, but the margins are steadily declining.\n\nDuring the 1990s, around 70 percent of first-time mothers of all ages were married, with about 18 percent single and the rest cohabiting, the report said.\n\nBy the years 2005-2012, however, data showed that a significantly smaller majority of new mothers \u2014 55 percent \u2014 were married, while 25 percent were cohabiting and 20 percent were single and without a steady partner.\n\nMoreover, the new data show that for the youngest mothers, norms surrounding marriage and childbearing have flipped.\n\nBefore 1990, more than 60 percent of first-time mothers aged 23 or younger were married, with smaller cohorts either cohabiting or single.\n\nBut after 2005, only 24 percent of these young women were married when they had their first child. Instead, they were more likely to be either cohabiting (38 percent) or not in any defined relationship at all (38 percent).\n\nAs marital norms weakened and cohabiting rose in the culture, demographers realized they needed more information about mothers \u2014 specifically whether the \u201cunwed\u201d mother was with a stable partner or on her own.\n\nThanks to changes in the bureau\u2019s Current Population Survey, relationships are more clearly revealed. The new data show, for instance, that among the young first-time mothers, \u201cthe growth in cohabitation as a context for first birth has roughly paralleled the decline in marriage,\u201d the report said.\n\nIn other highlights, the new report found that:\n\n\u2022 Married childbearing is the norm for women aged 25 or older \u2014 at least 70 percent of first births occur in wedlock.\n\n\u2022 Asian women are especially likely to marry before childbearing, with 80 percent or more of first-born Asian-American children born to married parents.\n\n\u2022 Among the states, South Dakota had the most births per capita by unmarried women, with 55 new births per every 1,000 unmarried women. Utah had the highest rate of total births, with 77 births for every 1,000 women between the ages of 15 and 50. By region, the Northeast saw the fewest number of new births per every 1,000 unmarried women.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The number of first-born U.S. babies born into a home with a married mother and father has fallen below 60 percent for the first time, the Census Bureau said Tuesday, while more than one in five first-born children are now born to cohabiting parents.", "Author": "Cheryl Wetzstein", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "The number of first-born U.S. babies born into a home with a married mother and father has fallen below 60 percent for the first time, the Census Bureau said Tuesday, while more than one in five first-born children are now born to cohabiting parents.", "title": "Census: More first-time mothers give birth out of wedlock", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/jul/8/census-more-first-time-mothers-give-birth-out-wedl/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2013/11/11/philippines-typhoonjpeg-0887c.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2013/11/11/philippines-typhoonjpeg-0887c.jpg", "title": "Census: More first-time mothers give birth out of wedlock", "description": "The number of first-born U.S. babies born into a home with a married mother and father has fallen below 60 percent for the first time, the Census Bureau said Tuesday, while more than one in five first", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "news_keywords": "Social Issues, Lindsay M Monte"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde3ab\"", "article_summary": "\u2022 Among the states, South Dakota had the most births per capita by unmarried women, with 55 new births per every 1,000 unmarried women.\nBefore 1990, more than 60 percent of first-time mothers aged 23 or younger were married, with smaller cohorts either cohabiting or single.\nBy region, the Northeast saw the fewest number of new births per every 1,000 unmarried women.\nDuring the 1990s, around 70 percent of first-time mothers of all ages were married, with about 18 percent single and the rest cohabiting, the report said.\nThe new data show, for instance, that among the young first-time mothers, \u201cthe growth in cohabitation as a context for first birth has roughly paralleled the decline in marriage,\u201d the report said."}
