PHOENIX (Dec. 13, 2013) — Phoenix-based Redburn Tire Co. is the first member of the Tire Industry Association (TIA) to sign on with TIA’s new self-funded group employee benefits solution.

TIA offers the program to its members through an alliance with the Association Benefits Solution (TABS). Redburn Tire will offer the health insurance program to all eligible employees and will also participate in the TABS wellness program, TIA said.

In the new program, TIA members will have the choice between Cigna and Aetna, two of the largest provider networks in the U.S., according to the association.

Through its partnership with a number of national trade associations, TABS serves nearly 300 employers representing more than 20,000 workers in every state except Hawaii, TIA said. All its plans are compliant with the federal Affordable Care Act.
