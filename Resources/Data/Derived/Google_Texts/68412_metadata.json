Ted Cruz (R-TX) on Sunday dismissed President Obama\u2019s newly appointed Ebola czar as a \u201cpolitical operative\u201d without the medical background necessary for the job \u2014 and he urged Americans to ignore the judgment of government health officials because they \u201care repeating the administration\u2019s talking points.\u201d\n\nCruz is one of a number of politicians calling for a more drastic response to the disease which, to date, has infected two Americans, both nurses who cared directly for Thomas Eric Duncan, the Liberian man who contracted the disease in his home country and fell ill in Texas.\n\nRelated: Ebola Czar\u2019s First Job \u2013 Calming the Public\n\nCruz and other Republicans have called for a ban that would prevent travelers from the three West African countries currently being ravaged by the disease from entering the U.S. Appearing on CNN on Sunday morning, Cruz presented a travel ban as an obvious an effective means of preventing the spread of Ebola to the U.S.\n\nPublic health officials have said such a ban would be ineffective at best and counterproductive at worst. Asked by CNN host Candy Crowley about those criticisms, Cruz dismissed them.\n\n\u201cThe doctors and the experts that are saying this are working for the administration and are repeating the administration\u2019s talking points, and their arguments don\u2019t make sense,\u201d Cruz said.\n\nIn response to a question about what mistakes had been made in the Texas hospital where Duncan was treated that allowed the nurses to become infected, Cruz pivoted again to the travel ban. \u201cThe first mistake that was made was allowing Thomas Duncan get on an airplane and fly to the United States. If he hadn\u2019t flown to the United States, none of the other mistakes would have happened,\u201d Cruz said.\n\nRelated: Three \u2018Fear Factors\u2019 That Could Tip the Senate Race\n\nBy refusing to heed calls for a travel ban, he said, \u201cThe Obama White House is digging in and not listening to the voices of common sense coming from both sides of the aisle.\u201d\n\nAppearing on the program shortly after Cruz, Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute for Allergy and Infections Diseases, said the senator has the facts absolutely backwards. In conversations with the administration, he said, he has been consistently asked for his medical judgment, not told what to say. \u201cThat is just not the case,\u201d Fauci said. \u201cI\u2019ve never had an experience where the president is telling me to tell him something that he wants to hear.\"\n\nRelated: Ebola Scams Prey on Public\u2019s Fears\n\nFauci, who made the rounds of the various talks shows Sunday morning, also addressed criticism from Cruz and others of the president\u2019s selection of Ron Klain, an attorney and Democratic operative, as the administration\u2019s Ebola Response Coordinator, or Ebola Czar. Cruz, who moments before had dismissed the opinions of doctors who work for the administration, blasted Obama for not putting a doctor in the job.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a misplaced criticism,\u201d Fauci said on ABC\u2019s This Week. \u201cWhat we\u2019re talking about now is an Ebola Response Coordinator. Somebody who has extraordinary \u2013 as he does \u2013 managerial experience.\u2026 He\u2019s going to rely on medical experts to do the medical things.\u201d\n\nRelated: No, Budget Cuts Didn\u2019t Prevent an Ebola Vaccine\n\nThe response to Ebola dominated the Sunday shows, including NBC\u2019s Meet the Press, which dedicated half of its program to a so-called \u201cEbola Summit.\u201d Across the programs, though, medical professionals refused to cater to the hype from journalists or the fear-mongering of politicians.\n\nOn Fox News Sunday, host Chris Wallace introduced Dr. Michael Osterholm, a prominent epidemiologist and a professor at the University of Minnesota, calling him a critic of the Obama administration\u2019s response to the disease.\n\nOsterholm quickly clarified that while he has been critical of the administration, his concerns lie in the failure to address the outbreak in Africa, not in the U.S. Like others in his field, he warned that as long as the disease rages out of control in Africa, limited cases will make it into other countries, well-intentioned travel bans notwithstanding.\n\nBut the idea that an out of control Ebola epidemic will occur in the United States, he said, is not something people need to worry about. \u201cWe will not have a community-wide outbreak in this country,\u201d he said flatly.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Senator Ted Cruz of Texas took the politicization of the country\u2019s response to the Ebola virus to new levels on Sunday, when he said that the judgment of public health experts can\u2019t be trusted because they work for President Obama", "title": "Ted Cruz: Obama\u2019s Public Health Experts Can\u2019t Be Trusted", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2014/10/19/Ted-Cruz-Obama-s-Public-Health-Experts-Can-t-Be-Trusted", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/12162013_Cruz.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2014/10/19/Ted-Cruz-Obama-s-Public-Health-Experts-Can-t-Be-Trusted", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/12162013_Cruz.jpg", "creator": "@rrgarver", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Senator Ted Cruz of Texas took the politicization of the country\u2019s response to the Ebola virus to new levels on Sunday, when he said that the judgment of public health experts can\u2019t be trusted because they work for President Obama", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477afa6914bd0286fe54f3\"", "article_summary": "\u201cWhat we\u2019re talking about now is an Ebola Response Coordinator.\nIf he hadn\u2019t flown to the United States, none of the other mistakes would have happened,\u201d Cruz said.\n\u201cThe doctors and the experts that are saying this are working for the administration and are repeating the administration\u2019s talking points, and their arguments don\u2019t make sense,\u201d Cruz said.\nIn response to a question about what mistakes had been made in the Texas hospital where Duncan was treated that allowed the nurses to become infected, Cruz pivoted again to the travel ban.\n\u201cThe first mistake that was made was allowing Thomas Duncan get on an airplane and fly to the United States."}
