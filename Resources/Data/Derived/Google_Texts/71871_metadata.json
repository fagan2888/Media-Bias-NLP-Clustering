America\u2019s Republican presidential candidates truly represented a cross section of our countries historic \u201cmelting pot.\u201d\n\nOn the other hand, we have two Socialists, (one \u201cFlaming Socialist\u201d and the other of the closet variety.) These two candidates could very well have been from a third-world election. The Democrat\u2019s only choice was: this old white socialist or that old white socialist, much like choosing between Fidel and Raul Castro.\n\nNo mistaking, American Republicans offered a cross section of America\u2019s \u201cmelting pot\u201d while the Democrats offered identical twins straight from the Socialist \u201cCrock Pot.\u201d\n\nSadly, thinking they are creating a perfect world where most everything is free, Socialist Democrats seem to be trying to destroy the very country they grew up in. Comparing that condition to an animal\u2019s behavior it\u2019s like a dog soiling it\u2019s own bed and that\u2019s something even a dog won\u2019t do intentionally.\n\nEconomic experts sociologist and historians all agree this country can not sustain itself through many more years of Liberal Socialism as it is destroying the economy, cultivating divisive racial separatism, and by using government authority, encouraging the moral degeneration of our family units and social structure.\n\nIn case you haven\u2019t noticed liberal Democrat members of Charlotte City Council have passed an ordinance declaring Women\u2019s restrooms open for both sexes. Liberal Democrats in Charlotte made it legal for boys to trot right in and use the women\u2019s restroom perhaps while your wife or daughter is in there \u2026 Gov. McCrory vows a fight.\n\nLiberal Democrats, not Republicans, are refusing to tell where illegal immigrants are being dumped in our country, random occurrences of diseases common in South America such as Polio, Measles and the Zika virus are appearing in areas known for liberal Democrat\u2019s that are sympathetic to illegal aliens.\n\nAfter spending $10 trillion less than eight years we hear from our liberal Socialist Democrat president that our infrastructure, roads, bridges, and such are falling apart and he needs a 25 cent a gallon tax on gasoline to fix everything\u2026again? Wasn\u2019t that what the trillions in stimulus money was for? Could we please see an itemized receipt of what the stimulus money really did purchase?\n\nAfter billions of dollars and thousands of lives lost, liberal Democrat administration made the decision to abandon Iraq which most say caused the rise of ISIS.\n\nAll sanctuary cities, where convicted illegal aliens are protected from deportation, are governed by Liberal Democrats\u2026 Areas of the country where marijuana is used for recreation are all governed by Liberal Democrats.\n\nIn the \u201cFast and Furious\u201d gun catastrophe, liberal Democrat official, (A.G. Eric Holder), gave Mexican drug gangs hundreds of high-powered rifles, capable of bring down a helicopter or stopping a car.\n\nTh same guns that ultimately ended the life of our boarder guard.\n\nThe 10 top cities for gun homicides in 2012 were Detroit, Baltimore,New Orleans, Oakland, Memphis, Cleveland, Kansas City Missouri, Philadelphia, and Chicago, all ten have Liberal Democrat governments.\n\nLiberal Socialist Democrats told the uninformed that Obamacare would do away with the 30 million Americans that had no health insurance yet recently, in South Carolina, Hillary Clinton bragged, Obamacare was such a great success that only 10 percent of Americans were uninsured\u2026.What?\u2026We\u2019ve spent trillions of dollars to get rid of 30 million uninsured and now we only have 10 percent of 315 million Americans uninsured?\n\nAnd Hillary Clinton is going from town to town telling everyone she will do the same great job Mr. Obama did.\n\nhttp://laurinburgexchange.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/web1_MarkPRINT.jpg\n\nMark Schenck Contributing columnist\n\nMark Schenck is chairman of the Scotland County Republican Party.\n\nMark Schenck is chairman of the Scotland County Republican Party.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.\n\nDisqus", "article_metadata": {"geo.region": "US-NC", "DC.rights": "Civitas Media", "geo.placename": "Laurinburg", "og": {"site_name": "Laurinburg Exchange", "description": "All Americans should take a little pride in our country\u2019s political system, no other country would offer a selection of 17 presidential candidates and from just one party.The Republican presidential race is what America is all about, \u201cfreedom.\u201d Freedom to challenge a government you disagree with or attempt to stop those you feel are trying [...]", "locality": "Laurinburg", "url": "http://laurinburgexchange.com/opinion/editorials/4142/melting-pot-or-crock-pot", "image": "http://laurinburgexchange.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/web1_MarkPRINT-273x300.jpg", "title": "Melting pot or Crock Pot?", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "region": "US-NC"}, "DC.type": "Text", "twitter": {"image": "http://laurinburgexchange.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/web1_MarkPRINT.jpg", "site": "@LbgExchange", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "- Laurinburg Exchange - laurinburgexchange.com"}, "DC.format": "text/html", "DC.contributor": "Laurinburg Exchange", "DC.publisher": "Laurinburg Exchange", "DC.identifier": "http://laurinburgexchange.com", "DC.relation": "http://dublincore.org/", "DC.language": "en_US", "article": {"section": "Editorials", "published_time": "2016-03-01T20:20:15+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-03-01T20:20:15+00:00", "author": "http://laurinburgexchange.com/author/englewoodindependent-2"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "DC.title": "Laurinburg Exchange, Laurinburg NC - www.laurinburgexchange.com"}, "article_summary": "The original 17 Republican presidential candidates offered voters choices not only in political philosophy but also a choice of gender, age, ethnic backgrounds, race and religion.\nIn case you haven\u2019t noticed liberal Democrat members of Charlotte City Council have passed an ordinance declaring Women\u2019s restrooms open for both sexes.\nAmerica\u2019s Republican presidential candidates truly represented a cross section of our countries historic \u201cmelting pot.\u201dOn the other hand, we have two Socialists, (one \u201cFlaming Socialist\u201d and the other of the closet variety.)\nAfter billions of dollars and thousands of lives lost, liberal Democrat administration made the decision to abandon Iraq which most say caused the rise of ISIS.\nAll sanctuary cities, where convicted illegal aliens are protected from deportation, are governed by Liberal Democrats\u2026 Areas of the country where marijuana is used for recreation are all governed by Liberal Democrats."}
