Now the bonus also hinges on health metrics including whether chronic patients have better health outcomes and whether people adhere more to their medication regimen, according to the company\u2019s latest proxy statement, which was filed last week.\n\nHumana spokesman Tom Noland told IL via email that the company\u2019s board of directors\u2019 Organization and Compensation Committee made the change \u201cto incentivize our executives to take actions to improve the health of our members.\u201d\n\nWhile 80 percent of the cash incentive remains tied to whether the company hits its earnings-per-share target, 20 percent is now tied to a \u201cconsumer health participation performance metric (CHP.)\n\nNoland said the CHP \u201cfocuses on increasing the levels of participation by our members in various programs and services proven to improve health outcomes and lower the cost of care.\u201d\n\nThe new approach enables the company to align part of managers\u2019 compensation with \u201cthe company\u2019s strategic vision of improving the health of the communities we serve 20 percent by 2020.\u201d\n\nThe CHP consists of five indicators, including:\n\nThe completion of patients\u2019 health risk assessment, which allows Humana \u201cto identify the new members who have the highest risk and need for our clinical programs.\u201d\n\nEngagement in the Humana at Home Chronic Care Program, which allows care managers to better help patients manage chronic conditions.\n\nUsage of the Humana Pharmacy, which, the company believes, leads to more patients adhering to their medication regimen.\n\nNoland said that for each of the five CHP components, the company set its target at or above performance achieved in 2014. \u201cThe target and maximum levels were set to appropriately reflect an increase over our historical performance, taking into account our projected new member growth,\u201d he said.\n\nAlas, company leaders said that overall results last year were not good enough to get the bonus.\n\nWhile the company recorded adjusted earnings per share of $7.75, which was above the target set for the bonus, \u201cin the opinion of our management and the committee, the organization as a whole did not meet expectations in terms of financial performance and customer outcomes.\n\n\u201cTherefore, consistent with our compensation philosophy, the committee determined not to pay our Named Executive Officers any compensation under the 2015 (Management Incentive Plan.)\u201d\n\nAdjusted EPS exclude items such as costs related to the proposed merger with Aetna and higher-than-expected medical claims costs associated with patients the company gained through the Affordable Care Act.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/wp-content/uploads/fbrfg/browserconfig.xml?v=PYYa6y0aQv", "description": "Humana has begun tying some executive compensation to whether the insurer\u2019s customers are getting healthier.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Insider Louisville", "description": "Humana has begun tying some executive compensation to whether the insurer\u2019s customers are getting healthier.", "title": "Humana\u00a0begins tying executive pay to health outcomes - Insider Louisville", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 603, "identifier": "http://insiderlouisville.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Screen-Shot-2015-04-08-at-3.40.49-PM.png", "height": 425}, "updated_time": "2016-03-14T16:56:13-04:00", "url": "http://insiderlouisville.com/business/humana-begins-tying-executive-pay-to-health-outcomes/", "type": "article"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#da532c", "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1496697903875229}, "theme-color": "#ffffff", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://i2.wp.com/insiderlouisville.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/cropped-favicon.png?fit=270%2C270", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/InsiderLouisville", "section": "Big Business", "tag": "Humana", "published_time": "2016-03-14T10:05:48-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-03-14T16:56:13-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Humana has begun tying some executive compensation to whether the insurer\u2019s customers are getting healthier.\nNoland said that for each of the five CHP components, the company set its target at or above performance achieved in 2014.\n\u201cTherefore, consistent with our compensation philosophy, the committee determined not to pay our Named Executive Officers any compensation under the 2015 (Management Incentive Plan.\nUsage of the Humana Pharmacy, which, the company believes, leads to more patients adhering to their medication regimen.\nUntil its most recent fiscal year, the Louisville-based insurer provided an annual cash incentive based solely on whether the company met its earnings-per-share target."}
