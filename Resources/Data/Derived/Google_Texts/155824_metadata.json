The company is looking to capitalize on the Affordable Care Act's mandate that everyone in the country be enrolled in an insurance plan by Dec. 15 or face fines. The health exchanges officially opened for business earlier this week, on Oct. 1.\n\nGoHealth is expanding rapidly, taking 90,000 square feet in the Merchandise Mart and planning to more than double its workforce to more than 1,000 people by year-end. Last summer, the company received a $50 million equity investment from Minneapolis-based Norwest Equity Partners.\n\nCustomers can seek one-on-one help from licensed GoHealth advisers who guide them through the selection and enrollment process, either over the phone or online.\n\nGoHealth makes its money by collecting fees from insurance agents for customer referrals, buying and reselling customer leads and building software for brokers, insurance carriers and other health care organizations.", "article_metadata": {"byline": "Brigid Sweeney", "timeCrawled": "20160526_13:38:19", "categoryName": "CCB - Health Care", "title": "Walgreen partners with GoHealth to clear up health insurance confusion", "taxo_Industries": "Internet", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=571426684", "twitter": {"image": "http://www.chicagobusiness.com/images/logo-square-200x200.png", "site": "@CrainsChicago", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Walgreen partners with GoHealth to clear up health insurance confusion"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#2d89ef", "og": {"site_name": "Crain's Chicago Business", "description": "It's a big win for Chicago-based GoHealth, which has expanded rapidly in the past 18 months.
