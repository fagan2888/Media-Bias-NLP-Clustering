REUTERS/Mike Segar\n\n4064113\n\nDavid Kennedy, the hacking expert that shook the country this week with his congressional testimony about the security failures of HealthCare.gov, explained Sunday how he was able to penetrate the site.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a technique called, what we call \u2018passive reconnaissance,'\u201d Kennedy explained to \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d host Chris Wallace, \u201cwhich allows us to query and look at how the website operates and performs.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd these type of attacks that I\u2019m mentioning here, and the 70,000 [personal records Kennedy found] that you\u2019re referencing, is very easy to do,\u201d Kennedy continued. \u201cIt\u2019s a rudimentary type attack that doesn\u2019t actually attack the website itself. It extracts information from it without actually having to go into the system.\u201d\n\n\u201cThink of it this way,\u201d he suggested. \u201cThink of something where you have a car and the car doors are open and the windows are open \u2014 you can see inside of it. That\u2019s basically what they allow you to do and there\u2019s no real sophistication level here \u2014 it\u2019s just really wide open. So there\u2019s no hacking actually involved.\u201d\n\nKennedy said that gaining access to 70,000 personal records of Obamacare enrollees via HealthCare.gov took no time at all, and required nothing more than a standard browser to pull off.\n\n\u201cAnd 70,000 was just one of the numbers that I was able to go up to and I stopped after that,\u201d Kennedy revealed. \u201cYou know, I\u2019m sure it\u2019s hundreds of thousands, if not more, and it was done within about a 4 minute timeframe. So, it\u2019s just wide open.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can literally just open up your browser, go to this, and extract all this information without actually having to hack the website itself,\u201d he added.\n\nFollow Vince on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Vince Coglianese", "description": "'It was done within about a 4 minute timeframe.
