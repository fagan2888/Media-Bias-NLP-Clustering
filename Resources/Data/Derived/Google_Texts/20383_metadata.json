But he took part in a study this spring at National Jewish Health in Denver that used a low-dose CT scan. He was diagnosed with stage 1 cancer.\n\n\u201cThe rest of his lungs looked pretty good, but there was this abnormality in his left upper lobe,\u201d Dr. Debra Dyer, a radiologist with National Jewish, said.\n\nStarting Jan. 1, private insurance companies must cover screenings for high-risk patients 55 and older who smoked a pack a day for 30 years.\n\nThe tumor was removed from his lung without chemotherapy or radiation.\n\nLung cancer is the No. 1 cancer killer of men and woman in the United States. Early detection is critical for survival in lung cancer cases, Dyer said. She said a study of 53,000 high-risk patients found annual scans make sense. There was a 20 percent reduction in lung cancer mortality as a result of using CT scans.\n\nSwank\u2019s diagnosis was timely indeed.\n\n\u201cStage 1 means it\u2019s all curable,\u201d Swank said. The stage refers to state the cancer is in when it\u2019s first diagnosed. Stage 1 generally means the cancer is localized.\n\nDyer said the new insurance mandates under the Affordable Care Act were momentous.\n\n\u201cThis is the best news we\u2019ve ever had about lung cancer,\u201d Dyer said.\n\nLINK: NJH Lung Cancer Screening CT Program\n\nLINK: Clinical Trial", "article_metadata": {"description": "The chest CT scan that smoker Stan Swank received in April may have saved his life, and offered proof that early detection of lung cancer is effective.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"url": "http://denver.cbslocal.com/2014/12/23/ct-scans-covered-by-insurance-is-best-news-says-denver-doctor/", "image": {"width": 1500, "secure_url": "https://cbsdenver.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/lung-cancer-2.jpg?w=1500", "identifier": "https://cbsdenver.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/lung-cancer-2.jpg?w=1500", "height": 844}, "type": "article", "description": "The chest CT scan that smoker Stan Swank received in April may have saved his life, and offered proof that early detection of lung cancer is effective.", "title": "CT Scans Covered By Insurance Is 'Best News,' Says Denver Doctor"}, "twitter": {"site": "/social/", "image": "https://cbsdenver.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/lung-cancer-2.jpg?w=1500", "description": "The chest CT scan that smoker Stan Swank received in April may have saved his life, and offered proof that early detection of lung cancer is effective.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "CT Scans Covered By Insurance Is 'Best News,' Says Denver Doctor"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "CBSDenver.com in Denver is Colorado's Online News Channel with up to the minute breaking news, weather, sports and top spots.", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "application-name": "CBS Denver", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/cbsdenver", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/cbsdenver"}, "keywords": "health, kathy walsh, links & info, local, news, syndicated local, affordable care act, ct scan, debra dyer, insurance, lung cancer, national jewish health, stan swank", "google-site-verification": "44caXBf4kjHeKKAT7ZZ89NaCX25utL_yRSa-qGpwIhY", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://denver.cbslocal.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/1358cb67b88b4ef2e59895070c511d70?s=16", "news_keywords": "affordable care act, ct scan, debra dyer, insurance, lung cancer, national jewish health, stan swank"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca942\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThis is the best news we\u2019ve ever had about lung cancer,\u201d Dyer said.\nBut he took part in a study this spring at National Jewish Health in Denver that used a low-dose CT scan.\nThere was a 20 percent reduction in lung cancer mortality as a result of using CT scans.\nLINK: NJH Lung Cancer Screening CT ProgramLINK: Clinical Trial\nSwank smoked for 55 years, one to two packs a day."}
