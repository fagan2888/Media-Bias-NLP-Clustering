Ford Charitable Trust, said in a statement. \"Her pioneering achievements of ensuring access to quality treatment will be expanded through the new Hazelden Betty Ford Foundation.\"\n\nThe two organizations began informal discussions in January 2013, and the boards formally announced the talks in June.\n\nConsolidated revenue at Hazelden is about $140 million, with addiction-based services bringing in about $110 million a year, according to officials.\n\nThat compares with about $40 million for the Betty Ford Center.\n\nAnalysts predict that the increased access to insurance under the Affordable Care Act and likely pressure from insurers to keep costs down will make it vital for institutions such as Hazelden and Betty Ford to coordinate care.\n\nThe law will provide for expanded coverage of such things as screenings, evaluations and counseling, which the addiction industry hopes will eventually put substance abuse treatment on par with treatment of other chronic illnesses.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Star Tribune", "description": "The merger of the Hazelden Foundation and the Betty Ford Center, two of the nation's best-known addiction treatment centers, is official after clearing its final regulatory hurdle from the state of California, the organizations announced Monday.", "title": "Hazelden, Betty Ford Center merger approved", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/hazelden-betty-ford-center-merger-approved/244742171/", "image": {"url": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_139208730336275.jpg?h=630&w=1200&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "width": 1200, "identifier": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_139208730336275.jpg?h=630&w=1200&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "google-site-verification": "bLXTXkzm4dJ8hcJy1LXawtxXxGP3JhInARj69uCiMiM", "twitter": {"description": "The merger of the Hazelden Foundation and the Betty Ford Center, two of the nation's best-known addiction treatment centers, is official after clearing its final regulatory hurdle from the state of California, the organizations announced Monday.", "title": "Hazelden, Betty Ford Center merger approved", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/hazelden-betty-ford-center-merger-approved/244742171/", "image": {"src": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_139208730336275.jpg?h=560&w=750&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "identifier": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_139208730336275.jpg?h=560&w=750&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces"}, "site": "@StarTribune", "card": "summary"}, "description": "The merger of the Hazelden Foundation and the Betty Ford Center, two of the nation's best-known addiction treatment centers, is official after clearing its final regulatory hurdle from the state of California, the organizations announced Monday."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf224\"", "article_summary": "The Betty Ford Center in Rancho Mirage, Calif., will keep its name and add the tagline: \"a part of the Hazelden Betty Ford Foundation.\"\nThat compares with about $40 million for the Betty Ford Center.\n\"Her pioneering achievements of ensuring access to quality treatment will be expanded through the new Hazelden Betty Ford Foundation.\"\nThe melding of the two addiction care powerhouses creates the nation's largest nonprofit treatment organization, which will be called the Hazelden Betty Ford Foundation.\nThe merger of the Hazelden Foundation and the Betty Ford Center, two of the nation's best-known addiction treatment centers, is official after clearing its final regulatory hurdle from the state of California, the organizations announced Monday."}
