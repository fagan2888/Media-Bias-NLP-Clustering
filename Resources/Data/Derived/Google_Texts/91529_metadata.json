Was it a determinative factor in his stunning loss? Both those who favor comprehensive immigration reform and the opponents who deride it as amnesty have been furiously trying to shape the conventional wisdom to bolster their view. The stakes are big: If the mere fact of mildly flirting with immigration reform could sink the sitting majority leader, who could be safe? \u201cBe afraid,\u201d Slate\u2019s John Dickerson warned Republican incumbents, for example\n\nSo the pro-reform forces are pushing back. Americans for a Conservative Direction, a pro-reform group headlined by former Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour among others, commissioned a poll of voters in Cantor\u2019s district (or do we now start referring to it as David Brat\u2019s district?) in the wake of Tuesday\u2019s upset and released it today. (Pause for a moment and consider how much of a threat the pro-reform forces see the Cantor loss if they felt compelled to commission a poll to try to keep conventional wisdom from settling on an \u201cimmigration-killed-Cantor\u201d narrative.)\n\n[GALLERY: Cartoons on the tea party]\n\nThe polling memo, from Basswood Research, argues that \u201cimmigration was not a major factor in Rep. Cantor\u2019s defeat\u201d because \u201camong those who voted for David Brat, 22 percent cite immigration as the main reason for their vote.\u201d Basswood\u2019s other clients, by the way, include certified tea party movementarians like the Senate Conservatives Fund and the Club for Growth, so it\u2019s not a squish outfit. And its results resonate with the survey Public Policy Polling conducted Monday and released yesterday, which found that 23 percent of voters in Cantor\u2019s district oppose the bipartisan comprehensive immigration reform bill at the center of this debate. Overall, Basswood found that the smallest portion of voters in Virginia\u2019s 7th Congressional District identified amnesty as the most harmful to America of five Obama policies.\n\nBut if you crunch the numbers, immigration may have played a more decisive role than Americans for a Conservative Direction gives it credit for. To wit: Brat got 36,110 votes to Cantor\u2019s 28,898 \u2013 that translates to a 55.5-44.5 thrashing but in real numbers is only a 7,212 vote difference. That\u2019s a bit more than one-fifth of Brat\u2019s total. In other words if you subtract the self-described immigration-motivated voters \u2013 the 22 percent \u2013 from Brat\u2019s total, he ends up with a marginally lower number of votes than Cantor. So while immigration may not have been the most important issue, it may have been a difference-maker.\n\n[READ: The Fight to Define Cantor's Defeat]\n\nOf course there are a number of important caveats, the first of which is that with a poll with a +/-4.9 percent margin of error you can\u2019t treat the numbers with anything like precision. Another, as a former political science professor of mine pointed out to me, is that we don\u2019t know what percentage of Cantor voters supported him because they thought he was pro-reform; and of course we cannot assume that just because those 22 percent of voters cited immigration as their reason for opposing Cantor (or supporting Brat) we can\u2019t assume that they would have otherwise supported Cantor.\n\nSo can we say dispositively that immigration was the critical factor in the Cantor race? No, we don\u2019t have enough data. But the race was close enough that it seems to have played a role.\n\nJon Lerner, the pollster who conducted the survey, emails this response:\n\nYour point about whether a lower tier issue was decisive strikes me as so broad that it could apply to a great many issues in a great many races. One could argue, for example, that the issues of funding Obamacare, or raising the debt ceiling, which were expressed concerns by a far larger group of voters in VA-7 then the margin between Cantor and Brat were the \u201cdecisive\u201d issues in the outcome. After all, Cantor voted to fund Obamacare and for raising the debt ceiling. But I\u2019m not making that argument, as there are numerous \u201cbut for\u201d causation cases to be made and no way to disprove any of them. I believe the more salient point is that the large majority of Brat voters themselves are pointing to issues other than immigration as drivers of their vote.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis leads to a larger point about Cantor\u2019s race, which is that it shouldn\u2019t have been close enough for immigration to make a difference. The truth is that Cantor\u2019s loss was probably due to a mix of different factors (but not Democratic meddling, per the Basswood poll), but one of the most compelling seems to be that Cantor made the fundamental mistake of losing touch with his district. Real Clear Politics\u2019s Sean Trende cites this as one of the factors in his analysis (\u201cI have yet to read anything suggesting that Cantor had a good home style,\u201d he writes) as does Middlebury College\u2019s Matt Dickinson (the aforementioned political science professor), who argues: \u201cHouse reelection rates are high \u2013 95 percent or more \u2013 not because the incumbents don\u2019t worry about losing. They are high because all most of them do is worry about losing.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"zone": "robert-schlesinger/blogentries", "keyword": "Politics [News]", "title": "Eric Cantor's Loss, Immigration and the Polls", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "How much did Eric Cantor's immigration flirtation hurt him?
