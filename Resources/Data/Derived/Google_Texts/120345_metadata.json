One, is that he\u2019s not a politician. This guy is the real deal. He\u2019s a real human being,\u201d one supporter said.\n\n\n\nNot only did Carson\u2019s most ardent supporters believe he can out-pace the Republican field, they also see him as the antidote to any higher ambitions harbored by a certain former first lady.\n\n\n\n\u201cCampaign strategy to defeat Hillary Clinton? Let her talk,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nFor his part, Carson said he won\u2019t be making the decision about a possible White House bid until early May.\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m taking all of this in. Every place I go, I\u2019m taking this in. I\u2019m watching the donations coming in, and it\u2019s definitely having an effect on my thinking,\u201d he said.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"category": "Politics", "ib-analytics": "data", "item-publish-date": "Tue, 07 Apr 2015 06:48:11 EDT", "generator": "ibPublish 2", "author": "Adam Sexton", "og": {"site_name": "WMUR", "description": "About 200 people turned out in Hollis on Monday night to see Dr. Ben Carson.", "title": "Potential presidential candidate Dr. Ben Carson visits Hollis voters", "url": "http://www.wmur.com/politics/potential-presidential-candidate-dr-ben-carson-visits-hollis-voters/32228594", "image": "http://www.wmur.com/image/view/-/32228614/medRes/2/-/maxh/630/maxw/1200/-/fl79q5/-/img-Dr-Ben-Carson-visits-supporters-in-Hollis.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.wmur.com/politics/potential-presidential-candidate-dr-ben-carson-visits-hollis-voters/32228594", "app": {"url": {"ipad": "wmur://content/article/32228594", "iphone": "wmur://content/article/32228594", "googleplay": "wmur://content/article/32228594"}, "name": {"ipad": "wmur", "iphone": "wmur", "googleplay": "wmur"}, "id": {"ipad": 504646663, "iphone": 504646663, "googleplay": "com.hearst.android.wmur"}}, "site": "@wmur9", "card": "app"}, "al": {"android": {"url": "wmur://content/article/32228594", "app_name": "wmur", "package": "com.hearst.android.wmur"}, "ios": {"url": "wmur://content/article/32228594", "app_store_id": 504646663, "app_name": "wmur"}}, "fb": {"app_id": 98665743246}, "vr": {"canonical": "http://www.wmur.com/politics/potential-presidential-candidate-dr-ben-carson-visits-hollis-voters/32228594"}, "keywords": "Dr. Ben Carson, president, campaign, Hollis", "google-site-verification": "xTJFxn8Gm6mXV5ugnbTb198craV_CkoMGMqQyL4EfS4", "news_keywords": "Dr. Ben Carson, president, campaign, Hollis", "description": "About 200 people turned out in Hollis on Monday night to see Dr. Ben Carson."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe23e0\"", "article_summary": "Raw video: Carson speaks to voters in HollisNow, he\u2019s thinking of running for president.\nAbout 200 people turned out in Hollis on Monday night to see Dr. Ben Carson.\nEvery place I go, I\u2019m taking this in.\n\u201cI\u2019m taking all of this in.\nCarson also stopped by the Hollis Pharmacy, giving the more intimate audience there a dose of populist self-reliance."}
