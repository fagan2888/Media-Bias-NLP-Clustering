Asa Hutchinson\u2019s \u201cArkansas Works\u201d proposal would replace the Private Option, an Obamacare Medicaid expansion program crafted by Republican legislators and implemented under Democratic Gov. Mike Beebe.\n\nThe Private Option uses Obamacare money to buy private health insurance for low-income Arkansans. Hutchinson officially supports ending the Private Option, which has been plagued by fraud and huge cost overruns since its 2014 launch.\n\nBut Hutchinson has also pleaded with the Arkansas State Legislature to keep taking Obamacare expansion money for working-age adults with no kids and no disabilities when the Private Option ends Dec. 31, 2016.\n\nThe governor telegraphed his intent to rebrand the Private Option in a January speech when he noted, \u201cthe phrase Private Option itself has become politically toxic.\u201d Hutchinson\u2019s office failed to respond to questions from Watchdog.org.\n\nNic Horton, a senior research fellow at the free-market Foundation for Government Accountability, said Arkansas Works is destined to fail and its major provisions require federal waivers the Obama administration will deny.\n\n\u201cArkansas Works is an ObamaCare Medicaid expansion by another name,\u201d Horton told Watchdog.org. \u201cThe state\u2019s not going to get the things they\u2019re asking for \u2014 not work requirements, not asset tests, not any of the other tweaks that they\u2019ve floated.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd I think they know this because they\u2019re already starting to pivot away from real work requirements, moving the goalposts and talking about \u2018work training.'\u201d\n\nUsing Obamacare money to cover the Obamacare expansion population, Arkansas Works would retain the Private Option\u2019s worst qualities, Horton said, adding billions to the national debt \u201cwhile nearly 3,000 Arkansans with disabilities remain on the waiting lists.\u201d\n\n\u201cUltimately, policymakers promised taxpayers and the truly needy they were ending the program,\u201d Horton continued. \u201cBut now they\u2019re trying to change the deal.\u201d\n\nThis month, the state Health Reform Legislative Task Force voted unanimously to back Arkansas Works. In a Dec. 16 press release, Hutchinson signaled he would move forward with Arkansas Works without a vote from the full Legislature.\n\n\u201cI think the governor\u2019s headed in a very strong direction with regard to Arkansas Works as a follow-on to the Private Option,\u201d health reform task force co-chair State Rep. Charlie Collins told Watchdog.org.\n\n\u201cFocusing on personal responsibility, encouraging work and encouraging healthy behaviors are exactly the type of changes to this program that are right for Arkansas and Arkansans,\u201d Collins said.\n\nCollins, a key Republican backer of the Private Option, said he is \u201centhusiastic to continue to support\u201d Hutchinson\u2019s proposed Obamacare expansion waiver requests.\n\nRELATED: Red states still grasping at Obamacare Medicaid cash\n\nHutchinson has promoted Arkansas Works as part of a larger package of Medicaid reforms to reduce spending on traditional Medicaid enrollees \u2014 the elderly, the disabled, pregnant women, children and impoverished families.\n\nNot all Republican lawmakers are excited about tying changes to traditional Medicaid to a renewed Obamacare expansion.\n\nState Rep. Josh Miller, a Republican from Heber Springs, applauded Hutchinson\u2019s support for reforming traditional Medicaid. But Miller opposes Obamacare expansion regardless of the label used or the waivers requested.\n\n\u201cI have been an advocate for reforming traditional Medicaid since long before I was elected as a state representative,\u201d Miller told Watchdog.org. \u201cThat\u2019s one of the biggest reasons I\u2019ve fought against Medicaid expansion.\u201d\n\nMiller said he\u2019s against making more Arkansans dependent on welfare, especially given the likelihood of Obamacare expansion funding cuts, the pressure expansion puts on traditional Medicaid and the lack of flexibility from the feds.\n\n\u201cI have a hard time voting for something where we\u2019ve got to go and ask somebody else permission, and if we don\u2019t get it then our taxpayers are stuck figuring out how we\u2019re gonna foot the bill,\u201d Miller said.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe we need to be expanding programs that are already broken,\u201d he added. \u201cI don\u2019t think the governor\u2019s got a slam-dunk on his hands, because so many folks were ready to be done with the Private Option.\u201d\n\nMiller said the governor will need approval from the Arkansas Legislature to move forward with Arkansas Works, and he expects legislators elected to fight the Private Option will see through the attempted rebranding.\n\n\u201cYou can call it whatever you want to call it \u2014 the Public Option, There Ain\u2019t No Option, Arkansas Works \u2014 it\u2019s still the Private Option,\u201d Miller continued. \u201cIt\u2019s still taking tax dollars that will be used for this expanded population and turning around and buying insurance.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Several Arkansas Republicans are encouraging their peers to support a rebranded version of the state's Obamacare expansion.", "og": {"site_name": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Several Arkansas Republicans are encouraging their peers to support a rebranded version of the state's Obamacare expansion.", "title": "Will Arkansas Republicans renew Obamacare expansion? - Watchdog.org", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2015/12/asa-hutchinson-state-of-arkansas-2015-04-30.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-12-22T08:42:18+00:00", "url": "http://watchdog.org/250819/arkansas-republicans-obamacare-expansion/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Several Arkansas Republicans are encouraging their peers to support a rebranded version of the state's Obamacare expansion.", "creator": "@jasonahart", "image": {"src": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2015/12/asa-hutchinson-state-of-arkansas-2015-04-30.jpg"}, "title": "Will Arkansas Republicans renew Obamacare expansion? - Watchdog.org", "site": "@watchdogorg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Watchdogorg", "section": "Arkansas", "published_time": "2015-12-22T04:00:07+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-12-22T08:42:18+00:00"}, "news_keywords": "arkansas works, private option, asa hutchinson, charlie collins, josh miller, arkansas rep collins, arkansas rep miller, foundation for government accountability, fga"}, "article_summary": "Several Arkansas Republicans are encouraging their peers to support a rebranded version of the state\u2019s Obamacare expansion.\nAsa Hutchinson\u2019s \u201cArkansas Works\u201d proposal would replace the Private Option, an Obamacare Medicaid expansion program crafted by Republican legislators and implemented under Democratic Gov.\n\u201cArkansas Works is an ObamaCare Medicaid expansion by another name,\u201d Horton told Watchdog.org.\nNot all Republican lawmakers are excited about tying changes to traditional Medicaid to a renewed Obamacare expansion.\n\u201cYou can call it whatever you want to call it \u2014 the Public Option, There Ain\u2019t No Option, Arkansas Works \u2014 it\u2019s still the Private Option,\u201d Miller continued."}
