LAS VEGAS — Demetrious Johnson retained his flyweight title Saturday night at UFC 178, submitting Chris Cariaso in the second round.

Johnson easily scored a takedown in the first round and stunned Cariaso with a looping right hook, followed by a knee to the jaw as the horn sounded to end the round.

Johnson kept the pressure on in the second and gained top control after Cariaso’s slip. Johnson swiftly maneuvered into side control, landed a few elbows and secured a Kimura, forcing Cariaso to tap out at 2:29 of the second.

Johnson improved to 21-2-1 with his fifth straight title defense.

In the co-main event, lightweight Donald Cerrone moved closer to a title shot with a unanimous decision over Eddie Alvarez. Cerrone used powerful leg kicks to wear down Alvarez, winning 29-28 on all three scorecards.

In a battle of rising featherweights, Conor McGregor made short work of Dustin Poirier, earning a TKO victory in the first round.

Yoel Romero survived a back and forth brawl to beat Tim Kennedy by TKO, and No. 1 women’s bantamweight contender Cat Zingano moved into position for a title shot with a third-round TKO over Amanda Nunes.

Former bantamweight champion Dominick Cruz highlighted the undercard with a first-round TKO over Takeya Mizugaki. Jorge Masvidal, Stephen Thompson, Brian Ebersole, Kevin Lee and Manvel Gamburyan also won.
