A car slid into Cherry Creek Tuesday night near the Denver Country Club.

The accident happened just before 10 p.m. off of East Speer Boulevard and Corona Street, said Mark Watson, a Denver Fire Department spokesman.

When firefighters arrived on the scene “no one was trapped” in the vehicle, Watson said.

A tow truck was called to extract the sedan out of the creek.

The Denver Police Department is investigating the cause of the accident.
