Loopholes in the law allow many financial advisers to offer advice based on what\u2019s best for them, not the person saving for retirement.\n\nWe need to change that. In today\u2019s world it\u2019s hard enough to save for retirement and achieve your financial goals. We don\u2019t need to make it more difficult by allowing some in the financial industry to take advantage of hardworking Americans. All advice should be in the best interest of the consumer. Bad financial advice is just wrong \u2014 period.\n\n>>Take action: Stop Wall Street from draining Americans\u2019 retirement savings\n\nPeople deserve investment advice based on what\u2019s truly best for them and their financial future. And AARP supports having investment professionals put consumers\u2019 interests first \u2014 ahead of their own personal gain.\n\nPresident Obama agrees and came to AARP today to discuss a new standard to hold Wall Street genuinely accountable for helping families choose the best investments for themselves and their futures.\n\nCore to our work at AARP is helping to prepare and inform Americans about the need for financial security. This change will give consumers added confidence to help them save for the future.\n\nWe\u2019re pleased the president is personally engaged in this fight to protect millions of Americans who\u2019ve worked hard to save so they have peace of mind about their financial stability.\n\nPhoto: Pete Marovich\n\nAlso of Interest\n\nSee the AARP home page for deals, savings tips, trivia and more.", "article_metadata": {"page_title": "blog", "twitter": {"description": "At AARP, we know that the people we represent have worked hard to save for retirement, and we believe that they deserve to have financial advisers who work just as hard to protect and grow their savings.
