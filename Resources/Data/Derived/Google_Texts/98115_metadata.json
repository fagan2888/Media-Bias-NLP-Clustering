Bloomberg News\n\nFaced with stiff competition in the job market, young South Koreans often turn to professional certificates to gain an advantage. That trend has spawned thousands of new certificates in recent years and a growing testing service industry.\n\nLast year, there were 6,773 different professional certificates issued by private institutions, up from 1,159 in 2010, according to South Korea\u2019s education ministry.\n\nJust 95 are recognized by the government, according to Kim Beom-su, a ministry official.\n\nPart of the increase in the last year can be attributed to the government\u2019s move in October to make registration obligatory for all certificates, following complaints about many tests that candidates found unhelpful for employment.\n\nIn February, South Korea\u2019s youth unemployment rate reached 10.9%, the highest in over a decade, according to the national statistics agency.\n\nA search on Naver, South Korea\u2019s most popular search engine, yields results that include certificates supposedly proving a candidate\u2019s proficiency in babysitting, leading tours of local plants or teaching while using an iPad, among many others.\n\nSouth Korean media reports say that over half of college students use at least one private education service with the goal of gaining employment upon graduation, citing survey data from career portal websites.\n\n\u201cIf the certificates aren\u2019t recognized by the government, companies must assess them independently,\u201d said Mr. Kim, adding that transparent guidelines from employers would eliminate excessive testing among candidates.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\nAlso popular on Korea Real Time now:\n\nSouth Korea\u2019s Governors-in-Theory for North Korea\n\nKAL Bomber Sparks Controversy With Malaysia Airlines Comments", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "Faced with stiff competition in the job market, young South Koreans often turn to professional certificates to gain an advantage.", "title": "Tough Job Market Spurs Boom in Skills Certificates", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/korearealtime/2014/03/18/tough-job-market-spurs-boom-in-skills-certificates/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-BY643_skjob_P_20140318035827.jpg"}, "site": "WSJ", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "World", "article.headline": "Tough Job Market Spurs Boom in Skills Certificates", "description": "Faced with stiff competition in the job market, young South Koreans often turn to professional certificates to gain an advantage.", "article_section": "World", "author": "Jeyup S.
