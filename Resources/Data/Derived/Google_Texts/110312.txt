Kirsten has been, and continues to be, a supporter of Obamacare so this is an admission against interest. She's not saying this because she hopes the law will fail, she's saying it despite the fact that it looks bad for her side.

Kirsten is right that, completely apart from the problems with the website, the law was not sold on the premise that some people's insurance would double. Obama actually promised that costs would go down substantially. For some people, those getting large government subsidies, their costs may go down but only because people like Kirsten and millions of other young, health people will be subsidizing them.
