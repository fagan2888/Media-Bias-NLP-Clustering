The now-suspended Atlanta official didn't do himself any favors when he used insensitive language to refer to the new home of the Braves. But he's been on a noteworthy quest to restore his reputation since his emails were released.\n\nHe's poked fun at himself on Twitter and tried his hand at a much more appropriate haiku. He's owned up to his mistake and, most importantly, penned a letter of apology to the citizens of Cobb. Here's a snippet of the missive, which was published in The Marietta Daily Journal over the weekend.\n\nLastly, to the people of Cobb County, many of whom I count as friends, it pains me to know that I may have insulted you. My parents live in Cobb. I will be spending Christmas there with my children. I can think of no clearer indication of my true opinion than that. I humbly ask for your forgiveness.\n\nThat may not stop Cobb powerbrokers from calling for his head. And Utz may eventually go the way of his boss, Duriya Farooqui, who left for a high-paying private sector gig shortly before the documents were released. Still, his reponses are worthy of your attention.\n\nAnd grant Utz this: At least he's not hiding under a rock. And at least he's staying away from alliterations.\n\n***\n\nThe Moral Monday protests coming to the statehouse next year are beginning to take shape.\n\nOrganizers sent us details yesterday of the agenda for the group's first rally, which coincides with the Jan. 13 start of the legislative session.\n\nIt involves a workshop with North Carolina NAACP President Rev. William Barber, who emerged as the leader of the weekly protests in Raleigh that led to dozens of arrests.\n\nAlso on the docket is a lawmaker who may emerge as a leader of the group here in Georgia: State Sen. Vincent Fort.\n\n***\n\nYou should file this under 'Wishful Thinking' but at least one civil rights leader thinks Atlanta has a shot - however far-fetched - of becoming the home of President Barack Obama's presidential library.\n\nAt a press conference yesterday targeting Obama's federal court picks, the Rev. Joseph Lowery was trying to make the point that the nominations will likely outlast his presidential tenure.\n\n\"Long after Barack Obama has gone back to Chicago or wherever he decides to go - he may come to Atlanta - wherever it is, the judges that he seats on our courts will still be there.\"\n\nObama's got few direct ties to Atlanta aside from the fundraising trips he makes down here, and the city is already home to one presidential library. But with Chicago, Hawaii and even New York in the running, Lowery may just be trying to stir the pot.\n\n***\n\nThe Capitol Hill publication Roll Call took a swing through Georgia's three open U.S. House races this week, diagnosing them as mostly wide open.\n\nOperatives say pinpointing top-tier candidates is more challenging because there\u2019s parity among their paltry fundraising. In the third quarter, none of the 13 Republican candidates who filed for any of the three open House seats raised more than $170,000. In fact, the majority of the candidates didn\u2019t even produce six-figure hauls. ... With the money race at a standstill, many of the candidates are vying for endorsements and ad spending from outside groups such as the Club for Growth. The club has a history of getting involved in primaries in safe Republican seats such as these. For example, in 2010, the club helped Rep. Tom Graves, R-Ga., win an open seat in the [9]th District.\n\nRoll Call's sources say Buddy Carter is the candidate to beat in the First District, Bob Barr is likely to make the runoff in the 11th District and the 10th is a muddle.\n\n***\n\nCongress' bipartisan budget deal left some holiday work to do for Appropriations Committee staffers: They must write a spending bill for the entire discretionary side of the government and have it ready for lawmakers' return in January.\n\nBloomberg Businessweek examines the difficulties of finding appropriations consensus, and what it means for Rep. Jack Kingston, the head of the politically potent health and labor subcommittee.\n\nThe Labor and Health bill covers about 30 percent of U.S. discretionary spending and includes about 50 percent of the most contentious issues, said [Scott] Lilly, currently a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress, a Washington policy research group aligned with Democrats. In addition to much of Obamacare, these include money for family planning, which Republicans often oppose, as well as workplace health and safety programs. The National Labor Relations Board is also funded through the same bill. The Republican chairman of the House Labor and Health subcommittee, Jack Kingston, is running for an open Senate seat in Georgia next year. He\u2019s positioning himself as the most conservative candidate in a primary likely to include at least six candidates, including other House members. If Kingston balks at some of the funding line items, Appropriations Committee Chairman Hal Rogers, a Kentucky Republican, and Maryland Democratic Senator Barbara Mikulski, his Senate counterpart, may have to work around him, said Lilly. \u201cKingston\u2019s been telling people he didn\u2019t think they could do a bill,\u201d he said.\n\n***\n\nIf you're traveling this Christmas Eve, hang in there. The New York Times reports airline legroom is winnowing further in coach, as if that was even possible:\n\nOver the last two decades, the space between seats \u2014 hardly roomy before \u2014 has fallen about 10 percent, from 34 inches to somewhere between 30 and 32 inches. Today, some airlines are pushing it even further, leaving only a knee-crunching 28 inches. To gain a little more space, airlines are turning to a new generation of seats that use lighter materials and less padding, moving the magazine pocket above the tray table and even reducing or eliminating the recline in seats. Some are even reducing the number of galleys and bathrooms.\n\n***\n\nFor the kids out there, here's the link to Norad's Santa Tracker. It has a zoom function, so you can determine his race for yourself.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "None", "og": {"url": "http://www.ajc.com/weblogs/political-insider/2013/dec/24/daily-jolt-apology-and-new-haiku-after-cobb-cracke/", "image": "http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/img/photos/2013/12/19/e7/2a/redacted_email.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "We\u2019ve got to hand it to Hans Utz.
