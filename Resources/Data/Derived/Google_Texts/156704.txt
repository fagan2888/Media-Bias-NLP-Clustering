Bernard Tyson, Kaiser Permanente chairman & CEO, explains how his hospitals are integrating new technology into the hospital experience to improve care and lower costs for patients.

It could take a "couple of years" to figure out the full costs of Obamacare to health-care providers, said Bernard Tyson, chairman and CEO of Kaiser Permanenteâ€”one of the nation's largest not-for-profit health plans, serving approximately 9.3 million members.

"We still have work to do better to understand the costs obviously because in most cases this is a new population in which they haven't had coverage before," he said on CNBC's "Squawk Box"on Monday.

As a supporter of Obamacare, Tyson pushed back against the notion that it's causing higher costs. "If someone gets sick, they get care," he said. "But unfortunately it's in the most expensive part of the health-care system: the emergency department."

He contented that Obamacare is helping to change that. "To the extent that people have now access to care to get into systems like Kaiser Permanente through the front door, we think that's a good thing."
