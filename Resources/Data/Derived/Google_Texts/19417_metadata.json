"Senate Democratic Whip Dick Durbin Dick DurbinReid: 'Lay off' Sanders criticism Senators tout 4.5B defense spending bill that sticks to budget Lawmakers seek changes in TSA PreCheck program MORE (D-Ill.) has introduced legislation to strengthen procedures for preventing, detecting and treating concussions in student athletes.\n\nThe Protecting Student Athletes from Concussions Act unveiled Thursday would set minimum state requirements for K-12 schools to follow when they suspect a student may have a concussion.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe bill institutes a \u201cwhen in doubt, sit out\u201d policy and forces schools to notify a student\u2019s parents of an injury and obtain a written release from a healthcare professional before the student may return to play.\n\n\u201cResearch has shown the serious long-term health risks associated with concussions in youth sports,\u201d Durbin said in a news release. \u201cI\u2019m glad to say that Illinois has been a leader on this issue, but it\u2019s time for all states to play under the same rules.\u201d\n\nAccording to figures from the National Federation of State High School Associations, Durbin said there are an estimated 140,000 students playing high school sports who suffer concussions every year, though many go unreported.\n\nDurbin said his legislation would raise awareness about the dangers of concussions among student athletes by building on a comprehensive plan implemented by the Illinois High School Athletic Association.\n\nIllinois law requires school districts to educate students, families and coaches about the nature and risk of concussions and requires student athletes to abstain from sports until they receive a medical evaluation and a letter of clearance from a licensed healthcare professional saying they can return.\n\nIf passed, states would have five years to issue guidance to schools about concussion plans under the Protecting Student Athletes from Concussions Act or forfeit 5 percent of its federal formula funding under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act in the first year and an additional 5 percent if the schools fails to comply a second year.", "article_metadata":
