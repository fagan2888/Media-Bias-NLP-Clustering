I entered in the following information: age 29, 1 person in the household, $40,000 annual income, zip code 92618 (Los Angeles area).\n\nThese were the cheapest plans:\n\nSo a single person age 29 in the L.A. area earning $40,000 gets no subsidy and must pay the full price. For that person, the cheapest plan on Covered California is the $190 Bronze plan (if there is a cheaper catastrophic plan, it doesn\u2019t appear on that part of the website.)\n\nI then went to ehealthinsurance.com and entered the same information plus specified that I was \u201cmale.\u201d Here are the two cheapest plans on ehealthinsurance.com:\n\nIn total there were 13 plans on ehealthinsurace.com (a PDF file showing the full results is here.) I then changed the gender setting on ehealthinsurance.com to female since women are usually charged more for health insurance on the individual market. There are still ten plans cheaper than the $190 Bronze plan on Covered California (pdf here). And the cheapest was also $94.\n\nTo get a plan on Covered California for only $94, a 29-year-old in the L.A. area has to qualify for a subsidy of $96 a month. Only people making about $26,050 a year or less will qualify for that amount of subsidy.\n\nSo there you have it. If you are on the individual market, have one of the plans that is less than $190 a month and make much more than $26,000 a year, you are going to experience some \u201crate shock.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://www.conservativeblog.org/storage/ehealth29.png?__SQUARESPACE_CACHEVERSION=1380910194676", "description": "Thanks to a twitter exchange, I decide to check out the shop/comparison tool at the Covered Califo...", "title": "Fun With ObamaCare Exchanges: California\u00a0Version - Amy Ridenour's National Center Blog - A Conservative Blog"}, "blogburst-verify": "B9EORVLmLdD0z2JKwETUEmoZ", "Robots": "index,follow"}, "article_summary": "Thanks to a twitter exchange, I decide to check out the shop/comparison tool at the Covered California site (yes, it does work!)\nThere are still ten plans cheaper than the $190 Bronze plan on Covered California (pdf here).\nFor that person, the cheapest plan on Covered California is the $190 Bronze plan (if there is a cheaper catastrophic plan, it doesn\u2019t appear on that part of the website.)\nTo get a plan on Covered California for only $94, a 29-year-old in the L.A. area has to qualify for a subsidy of $96 a month.\nI entered in the following information: age 29, 1 person in the household, $40,000 annual income, zip code 92618 (Los Angeles area)."}
