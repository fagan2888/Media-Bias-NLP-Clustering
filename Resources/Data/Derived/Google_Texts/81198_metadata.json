What you might not realize is that who gave you that desk \u2014 in other words, who you work for \u2014 may also have a big impact on your health.\n\nThe most common way people receive insurance is through their employer, and because employers handle this interaction, they end up being financially involved. A healthy person is going to incur fewer costs than an unhealthy person. Following this logic, one of the new provisions of the Affordable Care Act makes sense: employers can choose to fine employees who smoke as much as 50 percent of their health plan costs, and people who are overweight or obese as much as 30 percent.\n\nIt\u2019s doubtful this provision will be technically ready by the January 2014 launch date (if you haven\u2019t heard, the launch of Obamacare has been problematic), but it\u2019s coming nonetheless, and the administration hopes it will improve the health of the American people.\n\nNot only is the ACA encouraging this, but a September survey of American companies found that starting next year, 36 percent of companies plan to penalize people who don\u2019t take part in these programs \u2014 a number that\u2019s projected to rise, according to the survey, conducted by the National Business Group on Health (NBGH) and Towers Watson.\n\nBut costs shouldn\u2019t be the only thing at play as your employer encourages you to get fit, according to LuAnn Heinen, vice president of the National Business Group on Health and director of the Institute on Innovation in Workforce Well-being. In fact, David Roddenberry, co-founder of a company called HealthyWage that helps employers improve their workers\u2019 health, said fines won\u2019t actually help improve health at all.\n\nScientific research seems to be unclear, according to the authors of a New England Journal of Medicine paper published in August 2011. In that paper, the authors wrote: \u201cevidence that differential premiums change health-related behavior is scant. Indeed, we\u2019re unaware of any health insurance data that have convincingly demonstrated such effects.\u201d\n\nThe Obama Administration commissioned the RAND Corporation, a nonprofit research think tank, to investigate this very point for them, and found that currently, most organizations simply offer incentives for participation, not for results. The NEJM authors did find one randomized control trial that showed how rewarding people with $750 for quitting smoking rather than charging them $625 for smoking tripled the smoking cessation rate.\n\nWhile the ACA model may not have been extensively tested yet, corporate wellness is a big business \u2014 many companies already exist to help employers motivate their workers to be healthier. Here are some of the most effective management styles that they\u2019ve found to work. Let\u2019s hope Obama\u2019s reading.\n\nStress Management\n\nCreating a truly healthy work environment goes beyond adding financial incentives for people to participate in exercise programs or weight-loss, Heinen said. It also includes fostering work-life balance, providing healthy food, allowing flexible hours, creating on-site vaccinations and offering health screenings. In fact, the biggest health problem employees reported in the NBGH survey was not weight or smoking, but stress.\n\n\u201cStress is really important because it drives people\u2019s ability to be engaged and high-performing,\u201d Heinen said. While the employers thought the main driver of stress was a lack of work-life balance, employees actually reported that it was due to inadequate staffing, which resulted in a lack of support and uneven workload, the study found.\n\nChange the Corporate Culture\n\nFor a company to really be successful in getting people to be involved, it helps to create a strategy that appeals to that specific company. \u201cThere\u2019s no one recipe for any company, because the most successful programs tie into the ethos at the workplace,\u201d said Heinen.\n\nThis is a strategy that Athletes\u2019 Performance, a training company that has transitioned from training athletes to providing fitness support for corporate companies, also employs. They try to take advantage of the fact that a community of people is participating, said Mark Verstegen, founder and president of Athletes\u2019 Performance.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re really changing the employee experience, from where they park in the parking lot to the food in the dining halls,\u201d Verstegen said. As people become healthier, they report feeling more energized and engaged in their work.\n\nJeff Terrill, president of core performance for Athletes' Performance added that though the ACA will improve access to healthcare, access to insurance alone isn't a solution. Many companies will need to call in outside expertise to improve their workers' health, he said.\n\nFind the Individual\u2019s Motivation\n\nIt\u2019s also important to zoom in on the more granular level, however, and find out what really motivates each person, individually.\n\n\u201cWhat we really focus on is defining those different personas inside a corporate culture \u2014 meeting those people where they\u2019re at and providing an individual game plan, which gives them an individual structure,\u201d Verstegen said.\n\nHeinen agreed that structuring health incentives around people\u2019s individual desires works best. \u201cMost of us do have health goals,\u201d she said. Before participating, each person should figure out what his or her personal health objectives are, she said.\n\nUse Competition as Encouragement\n\nA full-time employee at the technology company Intermec, Mindy Workman was also a full-time student when Intermec brought on HealthyWage to help encourage weight loss. She knew that her health was suffering because of her hectic schedule, and was encouraged to take control of the situation. HealthyWage teamed her up with four other coworkers who would work together to encourage maximum weight loss, as they competed as a team for prizes.\n\nFor Workman, having the support of her teammates and knowing there were tangible results did the trick \u2014 she lost between 30-40 pounds in the first few months. She even continued working the HealthyWage in other competitions outside of the workplace, and has won $1,200 for losing weight. Coming in 50 pounds lighter, Workman said that having a goal to work toward really helped her.\n\nFinancial Benefits as Incentives\n\nA recent study by researchers at Ohio State University found that smokers cost their employers $6,000 annually in additional health care costs, compared to non-smokers. The National Business Group on Health study found that companies that were highly effective at engaging employees in health and well-being saved an average of $1,600 per employee per year.\n\nBecause of these high returns, employers often cover the costs of improving the health of their workers, and provide financial incentives for participation, particularly for smoking cessation, because the success of such a program can save so much money down the line, Heinen said.\n\nHealthyWage uses financial benefits very specifically \u2014 rather than penalize people for being unhealthy, it offers rewards. Anyone can win $100 for going from overweight to a healthy weight, for starters. They also incentivize people by having them create teams where everyone puts in a little money, and then they compete for cash prizes, all the way up to $10,000.\n\nPutting in some of your own money upfront helps people stay motivated, Roddenberry says, and using the possibility of a reward at the end can help people stay committed to the end.\n\nBut Heinen said she\u2019s advised companies who don\u2019t want to put in their own money, upfront, for wellness programs. In that case, the company will charge people who don\u2019t participate in the programs higher amounts in order to cover the costs and incentives, she said. \u201cIt can be funded by the people who aren\u2019t getting the refunds for being non-smokers,\u201d she said, so the programs \u201ccan end up being cost-neutral to the company.\u201d\n\nRoddenberry said that while as a society, it may be acceptable to fine someone for smoking, he doesn\u2019t think the same is true for obesity. \u201cI\u2019m thoroughly convinced people are not ready to embrace fat taxes.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "none", "description": "The Affordable Care Act makes it easier for employers to charge their employees for unhealthy habits, but some experts question whether that's the right approach.", "og": {"site_name": "EverydayHealth.com", "description": "The Affordable Care Act makes it easier for employers to charge their employees for unhealthy habits, but some experts question whether that's the right approach.", "title": "Your Employer Can Fine You for Being Overweight \u2014 Will it Help?", "url": "http://www.everydayhealth.com/healthy-living/your-employer-can-fine-you-for-being-overweight-will-it-help.aspx", "image": "http://brightcove04.o.brightcove.com/1815808389/1815808389_2238324104001_thumbnail-for-video-2228826610001.jpg?pubId=1815808389", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The Affordable Care Act makes it easier for employers to charge their employees for unhealthy habits, but some experts question whether that's the right approach.", "title": "Your Employer Can Fine You for Being Overweight \u2014 Will it Help?", "url": "http://www.everydayhealth.com/healthy-living/your-employer-can-fine-you-for-being-overweight-will-it-help.aspx", "image": "http://brightcove04.o.brightcove.com/1815808389/1815808389_2238324104001_thumbnail-for-video-2228826610001.jpg?pubId=1815808389", "site": "@everydayhealth", "card": "photo"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "fb": {"app_id": 135346036490186}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "The most common way people receive insurance is through their employer, and because employers handle this interaction, they end up being financially involved.\nIn fact, the biggest health problem employees reported in the NBGH survey was not weight or smoking, but stress.\nAnyone can win $100 for going from overweight to a healthy weight, for starters.\nComing in 50 pounds lighter, Workman said that having a goal to work toward really helped her.\nBut Heinen said she\u2019s advised companies who don\u2019t want to put in their own money, upfront, for wellness programs."}
