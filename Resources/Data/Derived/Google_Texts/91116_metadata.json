Five years later, Martinez has developed a comedy routine around her diagnosis and is affectionately known as the \"Cancer Queen of Comedy.\"\n\nMartinez told CBS News making cancer her career was her way of \"giving it the finger.\" She started off taking part in an annual breast cancer charity comedy show, and got massive laughs as she flung off her wig and talked about the absurdities of the disease that changed her life. \"It\u2019s my first time doing comedy, and I\u2019m trying not to die!\u201d she said to the crowd.\n\nMartinez also incorporates some education into her shows, encouraging the audience to get regular screenings for breast cancer.

Still, the cancer persisted. In 2012, doctors told Martinez her cancer isn't just back, but it's terminal. She currently has tumors from her scalp, down to her neck, spine, and hips. She plans to keep the laughter going, however, and has found strength in her daughter.\n\n\"I cannot leave her,\" she said. \"I'm not ready.\"", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "breast, cancer, can, be, funny, stand, comedian, nikki, martinez, jokes, about, diagnosis, cope", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Cancer isn't usually something to joke about, but Nikki Martinez uses humor to deal with her disease and spread awareness.", "title": "Meet The Stand-Up Comedian Laughing In The Face Of Her Cancer", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/breast-cancer-can-be-funny-stand-comedian-nikki-martinez-jokes-about-diagnosis-cope-360724", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured_video/public/2015/11/07/nikki-martinez.PNG", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Cancer isn't usually something to joke about, but Nikki Martinez uses humor to deal with her disease and spread awareness.", "title": "Meet The Stand-Up Comedian Laughing In The Face Of Her Cancer", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/breast-cancer-can-be-funny-stand-comedian-nikki-martinez-jokes-about-diagnosis-cope-360724", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured_video/public/2015/11/07/nikki-martinez.PNG", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/11/07/nikki-martinez.PNG"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-11-07T17:07:08-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-11-07T17:09:58-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Cancer isn't usually something to joke about, but Nikki Martinez uses humor to deal with her disease and spread awareness."}, "article_summary": "Martinez told CBS News making cancer her career was her way of \"giving it the finger.\"\nMartinez also incorporates some education into her shows, encouraging the audience to get regular screenings for breast cancer.\nWhen Nikki Martinez was diagnosed with stage three breast cancer, she needed a mastectomy \u2014 since she couldn\u2019t do anything to change that, she laughed at it.\n\"In the course of a year, maybe 10 to 15 of our regular audience members at some point or another are dealing with it,\" he said.\nIn 2012, doctors told Martinez her cancer isn't just back, but it's terminal."}
