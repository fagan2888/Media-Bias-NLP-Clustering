Steve Hayes, a senior writer for the Weekly Standard, told viewers Tuesday on “Special Report with Bret Baier” that when it comes to Democrats distancing themselves from the president and his failed rollout of the Affordable Care Act, “We are now seeing this. It’s a trickle right now. It will soon be a flood.”

Hayes said the only question was whether it would happen before or after Nov. 30, the administration’s target deadline for fixing the issues with the Healthcare.gov website.

His comments came as a notable Democrat critiqued the problems plaguing the ObamaCare rollout. Former President Bill Clinton today said President Obama should live up to his promise to Americans that if they like their health plans, they can keep them – even if it means a change to the law.

White House Press Secretary Jay Carney later said the president agreed with Clinton’s sentiment that the president should honor the commitment the federal government made to the American public when he said they could keep their existing plans.

On other Democrats joining suit, Hayes noted, “You can mark it down. It will happen. And then the White House will have to come up with another plan.”
