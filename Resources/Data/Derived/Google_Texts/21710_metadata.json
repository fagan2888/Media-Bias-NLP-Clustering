The requirement is scheduled to take effect on January 1.\n\nThe healthcare law states that individuals who obtain health insurance through an exchange \"established by a state\" qualify for a federal tax subsidy.\n\nIn their lawsuit, Indiana and its school districts argue that the purpose of that provision was to encourage states to set up their own exchanges. In 2012, however, the IRS added in its rule that the tax subsidies would be available to people who bought insurance on both state and federal exchanges.\n\nAs a result of the IRS rule, employers in Indiana, including state government employers, face significant penalties that are triggered when an individual worker receives a federal tax subsidy for purchasing insurance on the federal exchange. The employer mandate is scheduled to take effect on January 1, 2015.\n\nThe Indiana lawsuit claims that applying the subsidies and penalties in the state violates the Affordable Care Act and infringes on Indiana's right to state sovereignty under the U.S. Constitution's Tenth Amendment.\n\nTo avoid the risk of employer penalties, the state and its school districts are cutting the hours of part-time employees, including teachers, so that they do not qualify for health benefits under the employer mandate, the complaint said.\n\nThe Indiana plaintiffs have asked the court to block the IRS rule from taking effect and prevent the federal government from enforcing the healthcare law in Indiana.\n\nThe case is State of Indiana et al v. Internal Revenue Service et al, U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana, No. 13-1612.\n\n(Reporting by Terry Baynes in New York; Editing by Ted Botha and Paul Simao)", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Terry Baynes", "Author": "Terry Baynes", "DCSext.PageNumber": 1, "twitter": {"description": "The state of Indiana and 15 of its public school districts sued the U.S. government on Tuesday, challenging its use of federal tax subsidies and penalties to implement President Barack Obama's 2010 healthcare law.", "title": "Indiana government, school districts sue over IRS healthcare rule", "image": {"src": "http://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png"}, "creator": "@Reuters", "site": "@Reuters", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "DCSext.rChannel": "Article - News", "sailthru.tags": "US, USA, HEALTHCARE, INDIANA", "sailthru.title": "Indiana government, school districts sue over IRS healthcare rule", "keywords": "US,USA,HEALTHCARE,INDIANA,Indiana,Taxation,Government / Politics,Lawmaking,Healthcare Services (TRBC),US Government News,Financials (TRBC),Education,Healthcare Policy,Insurance (TRBC),Healthcare (TRBC)", "DCSext.ContentType": "Article", "news_keywords": "US;USA;HEALTHCARE;INDIANA;Indiana;Taxation;Government / Politics;Lawmaking;Healthcare Services (TRBC);US Government News;Financials (TRBC);Education;Healthcare Policy;Insurance (TRBC);Healthcare (TRBC)", "WT.cg_n": "World", "DCSext.ContentID_domesticNews": "USBRE99710W20131008", "DCSext.ContentChannel": "domesticNews", "sailthru.date": "2013-10-08T20:57:55+0000", "DCSext.ChannelList": "domesticNews;Inspiration;everything;treasuryMarkets;Continental;Shell;Verizon;Amtrak;Amtrak2;yahoo3;Adfriendly1;VerizonMap;echoActivityStream;Boston;Suntrust_SmallBiz;AllianzInsurance;HSBC_US;FedExSMB;everythingButHugin;SprintNow;AXAinsurance;OutloudFeed;Allianz;cfpboard;CFA;sapawarenesslife;sprintxpert2;samsung;asia;verizonmm;credit-rss;Healthcare2012;Pfizersafe;cfaglobal;merrilledge;ernstyoung;citianniversary;HSBCGlobal;fedex_neg;upshealthcare;citgroup;Intel", "DCSext.ContentHeadline": "Indiana+government%2C+school+districts+sue+over+IRS+healthcare+rule", "DCSext.ContentID": "USBRE99710W20131008", "WT.cg_s": "U.S", "description": "The state of Indiana and 15 of its public school districts sued the U.S. government on Tuesday, challenging its use of federal tax subsidies and penalties to implement President Barack Obama's 2010 healthcare law.", "sailthru.contenttype": "Article", "sailthru.description": "The state of Indiana and 15 of its public school districts sued the U.S. government on Tuesday, challenging its use of federal tax subsidies and penalties to implement President Barack Obama's 2010 healthcare law.", "robots": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "WT.z_inlinetype": "false", "DCSext.rAuthor": "Terry Baynes", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters"}, "DCSext.rCountry": "BETAUS", "DCSext.DartZone": "us.reuters/world/us/article", "viewport": "width=1100", "DCSext.PageTotal": 1, "WT.z_navid": "nav-Text-domesticNews", "site edition": "Reuters", "og": {"site_name": "Reuters", "description": "The state of Indiana and 15 of its public school districts sued the U.S. government on Tuesday, challenging its use of federal tax subsidies and penalties to implement President Barack Obama's 2010 healthcare law.", "title": "Indiana government, school districts sue over IRS healthcare rule", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-healthcare-indiana-idUSBRE99710W20131008", "article": {"section": "World", "tag": "US,USA,HEALTHCARE,INDIANA,Indiana,Taxation,Government / Politics,Lawmaking,Healthcare Services (TRBC),US Government News,Financials (TRBC),Education,Healthcare Policy,Insurance (TRBC),Healthcare (TRBC)", "published_time": "2013-10-08T20:57:55+0000", "modified_time": "2013-10-08T20:57:55+0000", "author": "Terry Baynes"}, "type": "article"}, "REVISION_DATE": "Tue Oct 08 20:57:55 UTC 2013", "DCSext.contentversion": "original"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9452\"", "article_summary": "The Indiana plaintiffs have asked the court to block the IRS rule from taking effect and prevent the federal government from enforcing the healthcare law in Indiana.\nIn their lawsuit, Indiana and its school districts argue that the purpose of that provision was to encourage states to set up their own exchanges.\nThe state of Indiana and 15 of its public school districts sued the U.S. government on Tuesday, challenging its use of federal tax subsidies and penalties to implement President Barack Obama's 2010 healthcare law.\nThe healthcare law states that individuals who obtain health insurance through an exchange \"established by a state\" qualify for a federal tax subsidy.\nThe case is State of Indiana et al v.
