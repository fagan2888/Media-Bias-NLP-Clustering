That’s the question asked by political analyst Rhodes Cook in the most recent edition of Politico magazine. Mr. Cook noted that it is quite common for re-elected presidents to witness precipitous drops in their approval ratings in Round 2, and that President Obama has been no exception.

Mr. Cook pinned the president’s popularity woes on lingering economic problems, distaste for the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, and the scandals that have dogged the Obama administration. He declared it is not impossible, but unlikely Mr. Obama will be able to stage a comeback.

I think Mr. Cook’s intuition is right on the money. If something happens to erode confidence in a president early in his second term, the lame-duck nature of Round 2 makes it difficult to climb out of the hole. In Mr. Obama’s case, not long after he was re-elected in 2012, many Americans came to see his administration as an incompetent group of political tricksters, because of the aforementioned debacles. Given that the resulting approval-ratings slump hasn’t reversed itself, it seems this narrative is set in stone.

Since Mr. Obama’s political capital diminishes by the day, it seems there is little he can do to change – no pun intended – things. Indeed, his second-term situation is analogous to that of his predecessor, George W. Bush.

As Mr. Cook pointed out, a major economic upsurge or a “rally around the flag” event could help the president, but it sure seems he faces steep odds.
