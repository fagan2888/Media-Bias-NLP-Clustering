Jeff Hallock said Saturday at a news conference.\n\nThe inmates were last seen at 5 a.m. Friday at the Orange County Central Men\u2019s Jail in Santa Ana, about 40 miles southeast of Los Angeles. They could have escaped any time between then and late Friday night.\n\n\u201cThe inmates cut through half-inch steel bars to facilitate their escape,\u201d Hallock said.\n\nThey also cut through plumbing tunnels and finally made it to an unguarded area of the roof where they were able to rappel to the ground using some kind of makeshift rope, Hallock said.\n\nThey were last seen wearing orange jail jumpsuits, he said.\n\nThe inmates were seen at a 5 a.m. inmate count and were discovered missing at the 8 p.m. count, Hallock said.\n\nBefore the nighttime count, there was some kind of disturbance at the jail that may have been part of the escape plan, Hallock said.\n\nIt slightly delayed the discovery that the men were missing, he said.\n\nSome \u201csmall pieces of evidence\u201d have been collected and investigators will be looking at surveillance camera footage, Hallock said.\n\nEarlier, Hallock said it was the first escape from the 900-inmate facility in 20 years.\n\nInvestigators were working around the clock with other county agencies, the FBI and U.S. marshals, Sheriff Sandra Hutchens said in a statement.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Inmates rappelled from roof to escape California jail", "title": "Inmates rappelled from roof to escape California jail", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Inmates rappelled from roof to escape California jail", "title": "Inmates rappelled from roof to escape California jail", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2016/01/24/inmates_rappelled_from_roof_to_escape_california_jail/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/01/inmates-escape.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Inmates rappelled from roof to escape California jail", "title": "Inmates rappelled from roof to escape California jail", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/01/inmates-escape.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Amanda Lee Myers", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "The inmates were seen at a 5 a.m. inmate count and were discovered missing at the 8 p.m. count, Hallock said.\n\u201cThe inmates cut through half-inch steel bars to facilitate their escape,\u201d Hallock said.\n\u201cIt was very well-thought-out and planned,\u201d Orange County sheriff\u2019s Lt.
