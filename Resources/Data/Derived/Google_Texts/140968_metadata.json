She stated that \u201c[a]s president, I will make a firm commitment to ensure Israel maintains its qualitative military edge. . . The United States should provide Israel with the most sophisticated defense technology so it can deter and stop any threats. That includes bolstering Israeli missile defenses with new systems like the Arrow Three and David\u2019s Sling. And we should work together to develop better tunnel detection, technology to prevent armed smuggling, kidnapping and terrorist attacks.\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s be clear about one thing: ensuring that Israel can continue its unlawful and immoral expansion of West Bank settlements, destruction of Palestinian homes and land, and the like is no way to support Jews. That is like giving an addict their drug of choice as a way to help them, when in fact it is only pushing them further into their unhealthy behavior, almost ensuring no way out. Providing Israel with even greater means by which to enact their horrific policies and violence against Palestinians will only ensure the spread of anti-semitism around the world and make Jews less safe, not more. Too many people already believe that Jews control the sources of power in our country (you only have to read tweets in support of Donald Trump to see this).\n\nAnd Hillary\u2019s promise to keep Israel safe is indicative of her hawkish style more broadly around the globe. Her support of the coup in Honduras, the overthrow of Gaddafi in Libya and her uncritical support of Saudi Arabia are just a few examples of what we can expect from Clinton\u2019s foreign policy. When you rely on Henry Kissinger, a war criminal, to back you, you should know you are on the wrong side of history.", "article_metadata": {"description": "She just gave a clear statement of her foreign policy agenda \u2014 and it isn't a pretty picture for the world", "author": "Cat J.
