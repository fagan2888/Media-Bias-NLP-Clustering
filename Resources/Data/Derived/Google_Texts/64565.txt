Many, many years from now, in the time of our great-great-grandchildren, the thought of someone not having health insurance will seem like an exaggerated tale from the wayback times, utterly unrelatable to the current sensibilities. Like the way standing on bread lines during the Great Depression seems far-off and distant to millennials.

But until we get to that point, it seems we’re all doomed to bear witness to the political battle over health care legislation. Whether you call it the Affordable Care Act, Obamacare, or now SCOTUScare, the fights over the law have dominated the last five years.

Last week’s Supreme Court decision in King v. Burwell was the latest in a series of court victories for supporters of the Affordable Care Act. Not that any of the decisions have stemmed the conservative desire to see Obamacare’s longevity cut short, as they’ve repeatedly launched legal battles to end the law.

So what’s John Oliver’s take on the legislative history of the law, and, most importantly will King, at last, bring closure for the ACA?

To paraphrase the great wit, Mark Twain, reports of the ACA’s demise have been greatly exaggerated.
