Don and Susie Kirlin were married Sept. 28, 1979, in Greeley. They met at the University of Northern Colorado while attending graduate school.

After graduation, in 1980 they moved to Boulder, where Susie was a teacher and Don pursued a career in aviation. After serving as a pilot for US Airways, Don went on to start his own company in 1994, providing training to the U.S. military.

They have three children, Kacie and Chris, who live in Denver, and Cody, currently in Puerto Rico.

Traveling together as a family has always been Don and Susie's favorite activity, and that is how they plan to celebrate this milestone.
