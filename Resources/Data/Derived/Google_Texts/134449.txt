Commerce City police are investigating an explosion Friday at a housing complex caused by the manufacturing of hash oil in one of the units.

Officials said officers responded a little after 5 p.m.to a report of the explosion in the 7300 block of Oneida Drive. Police said the blast damaged a room, but did not appear to affect the other units in the complex.

The remaining units in the housing complex were evacuated for the night, pending an inspection to confirm that the integrity of the building was not compromised.

The person conducting the hash oil extraction sustained minor injuries during the explosion, police said.

Hash oil, police said, is extracted from marijuana using a chemical process that is both highly volatile and extremely dangerous, because of the explosive nature of the chemicals involved.

Commerce City Police Department is working in conjunction with the North Metro Drug Task Force and the South Adams County Fire Department to complete the investigation.
