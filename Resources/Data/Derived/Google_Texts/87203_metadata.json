I will see what happens. I have to be treated fairly,\u201d Mr. Trump told ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week.\u201d \u201cWhen I did this, I said I have to be treated fairly. If I\u2019m treated fairly, I\u2019m fine. All I want to do is [have] a level playing field.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump, whose outsider run has stunned the Republican establishment, basked Sunday in the glow of a new Washington Post/ABC News poll that has him leading the 2016 field. He garnered 32 percent of support, ahead of retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson at 22 percent.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m leading every poll by a lot,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cIt\u2019s not even a little bit anymore \u2014 it\u2019s a lot.\u201d\n\nThe rest of field barely cracked double digits, with Florida Sen. Marco Rubio at 11 percent, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz at 8 percent and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush at 6 percent.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s bluntness generated more headlines over the weekend. He said Syrian refugees should not be allowed into the U.S., but added that he would at least want a database of those who do make it in through the U.S. vetting system \u2014 a clarification of remarks that suggested he wanted a database of all Muslims in the U.S.\n\n\u201cWe have no idea who these people are,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cWe don\u2019t know if they\u2019re ISIS, we don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a Trojan horse.\u201d\n\nHe also called for surveillance of certain U.S. mosques, arguing that New York City officials were essentially doing that in the wake of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.\n\nAnd he said he would be OK with waterboarding, despite widespread condemnation of the interrogation technique during former President George W. Bush\u2019s tenure.\n\n\u201cI would bring it back, yes,\u201d Mr. Trump said, citing the Islamic State\u2019s brutality. \u201cI think waterboarding is peanuts compared to what they\u2019re doing to us.\u201d\n\nYet he was evasive about whether someone on a terrorism watch list should be able to buy a gun, declining to directly answer the question.\n\n\u201cIf somebody is on a watch list, I would keep \u2018em away, absolutely,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Donald Trump hinted Sunday that he is willing to retreat from a pledge he signed in September to support the Republican nominee and forgo an independent run if he fails to grab the 2016 nomination.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Donald Trump hinted Sunday that he is willing to retreat from a pledge he signed in September to support the Republican nominee and forgo an independent run if he fails to grab the 2016 nomination.", "title": "Donald Trump, Republican presidential front-runner, evasive about GOP pledge", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/nov/22/donald-trump-republican-presidential-front-runner-/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/11/21/GOP_Trump_2016.JPEG-0ce78.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/11/21/GOP_Trump_2016.JPEG-0ce78.jpg", "description": "Donald Trump hinted Sunday that he is willing to retreat from a pledge he signed in September to support the Republican nominee and forgo an independent run if he fails to grab the 2016 nomination.", "card": "summary", "title": "Donald Trump, Republican presidential front-runner, evasive about GOP"}, "Author": "Tom Howell Jr.", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Politics, Donald Trump"}, "article_summary": "I have to be treated fairly,\u201d Mr. Trump told ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week.\u201d \u201cWhen I did this, I said I have to be treated fairly.\n\u201cI would bring it back, yes,\u201d Mr. Trump said, citing the Islamic State\u2019s brutality.\n\u201cI\u2019m leading every poll by a lot,\u201d Mr. Trump said.\nGOP presidential front-runner Donald Trump hinted Sunday that he is willing to retreat from a pledge he signed in September to support the Republican nominee and forgo an independent run if he fails to grab the 2016 nomination.\nMr. Trump\u2019s bluntness generated more headlines over the weekend."}
