Gillies, who made 49 saves on Saturday, was named the NCAA Tournament\u2019s MVP. USA TODAY Sports\n\n\n\n\n\nFor weeks now, Boston University coach David Quinn has been telling folks that the margin for error grows smaller the deeper a team goes into the playoffs.Quinn\u2019s words proved excruciatingly prophetic for the Terriers Saturday night, as Providence College staged one of the most shocking finishes in the history of the NCAA Division I tournament, using a strong third period and a bit of saintly luck to grab a 4-3 victory at TD Garden...The Terriers entered the game heavily favored, with Hobey Baker Award winner Jack Eichel leading the way, a starry supporting cast of talented forwards like Eichel linemates Evan Rodrigues and Danny O\u2019Regan, and a blossoming freshman-laden defense that had been the talk of the land...All the pieces were in place to grab a sixth national title. And BU led 3-2 going into the third, and was 19-0 when leading through two frames this season.But then, suddenly, the hockey gods turned a blind eye...A casual dump-in by Friars defenseman Tom Parisi was caught by BU junior goalie Matt O\u2019Connor (39 saves), who then played the puck like Dick Stuart on a popup \u2014 dropping the puck between his skates and over the line. The goal came at 11:24 and knotted the score, 3-3...Quinn called timeout at 13:41 to settle his troops, but the effort backfired. Over on the other bench, Friars associate coach Steve Miller concocted a faceoff strategy that paid huge dividends. From his offensive right circle, centerman Kevin Rooney won the draw to his left, and left winger Steve McParland tied up his Terrier counterpart \u2014 allowing junior right winger Brandon Tanev to cut across the circle, pick up the puck, enter the slot and rifle a wrister over O\u2019Connor\u2019s glove to give PC the lead with 6:17 to go...\u201cIt was amazing. I couldn\u2019t even register what was going on,\u201d said Tanev. \u201cIt was a heck of a draw win by Kevin Rooney. Steve McParland was able to give me some space and I was able to rip that puck and it went in.\u201d..The Friars (26-13-2) would not have had a chance last night but for tournament Most Outstanding Performer Jon Gillies, who made 49 saves and kept it close as BU threatened to break it open.\u201cWe beat a terrific opponent tonight,\u201d said PC coach Nate Leaman. \u201cThey had us on our heels in the first and third periods and Jonny (Gillies) held us in there. Obviously, we got a big bounce, got a heck of a bounce.\u201d..The Terriers (28-8-5) outshot PC in the opening period, 18-6, but it was the Friars who jumped ahead at 9:25. Junior co-captain Noel Acciari rifled the puck off the right post, and the carom came to sophomore defenseman Anthony Florentino, who found the far side behind O\u2019Connor...But BU went to work and connected twice in a record-setting four-second span. First, Ahti Oksanen pumped home a shot just inside the near post at 12:50.On the ensuing faceoff, Eichel pushed the puck forward and retrieved it, suddenly exploding into the Friars zone. He slid a feed to O\u2019Regan, who let fly a backhander while falling that sailed past Gillies at 12:54...PC junior Mark Jankowski knotted the score on the power play at 4:29 of the second period. BU answered at 11:36, when Oksanen put a shot on net, that Gillies couldn\u2019t control and Hohmann potted the rebound at 11:36 for a 3-2 lead...The Friars put the pressure on in the third period, earning a 20-12 shot advantage, and the heat finally caused O\u2019Connor and the Terriers to crack.\u201cSometimes experience is the best remedy for what we went through tonight and we didn\u2019t have it,\u201d said Quinn about the nation\u2019s youngest team (20 years, 145 days). \u201cI\u2019d love to have our guys up here with smiles on their faces instead of tears in their eyes. But, sometimes it\u2019s a process ... It\u2019s a tough one to swallow, but we\u2019ll be back.\u201d..", "article_metadata": {"description": "For weeks now, Boston University coach David Quinn has been telling folks that the margin for error grows smaller the deeper a team goes into the playoffs.
