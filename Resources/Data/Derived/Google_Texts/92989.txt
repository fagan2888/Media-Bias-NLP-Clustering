In celebration of Labor Day, crowds arrived at the Clark County Regional Airport to enjoy the First Annual Community Appreciation Airfair and Car Show.

A variety of old and new cars were on display, along with planes and military vehicles. Helicopter and plane rides brought excitement to the new event, but the U.S. Airforce's C-130H Hercules Airplane stole the show. Long lines formed as patrons waited to tour the inside of the plane and sit in the the cockpit.

Captain Trevor Sutherland, who now flies the plane, has memories of attending similar shows with his father and dreaming of being a pilot.

"I remember walking around at air shows, eyes full of wonder, saying I want to do that one day," Sutherland said. Now, Sutherland said he’s fostering that dream for other people. “It's very gratifying."

Old memories were also restored for Cory Rayman, who brought his wife Leia and daughter Janelle to the event.

"I remember my dad used to bring me and my brother out here back in '95," Rayman said.

By bringing his daughter this year, Rayman hopes to recreate those same memories in her heart. "I hope she loves it," he said.
