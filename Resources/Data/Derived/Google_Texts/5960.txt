To a packed auditorium Sanders addressed issues like the economy, income and wealth inequality, climate change and what he called Republican values.

“Their family values mean that women in America should not have the right to control their bodies. I strongly disagree with that. Their views on family values our gay brothers and sisters should not have the right to get married. I strongly disagree with that,” he said.

Moderator and KCCI political analyst Denis Goldford said Sanders did well Sunday.

“Whatever his fortunes might be in Iowa, I think he's got a good reason to feel pretty good after this event,” Goldford said.

Audience members who spoke with KCCI said that while they believe in Sander’s agenda, they worry about how realistic his ideas are.

“I think he's a man of integrity, I think he believes what he is saying. I realistically don't know what he wants to do is doable,” said Wendi Harris.

“I am impressed by his energy and his dedication to working for low-income people, the working class. I wish there was a way he could implement his ideas,” said Ron Jackson.

Sanders also made campaign stops at the Des Moines Youth Summit at Creative Visions in Des Moines and the Webster County Democratic pork chop dinner in Fort Dodge.
