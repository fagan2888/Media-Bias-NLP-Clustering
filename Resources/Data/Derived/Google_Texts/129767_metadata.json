But it may be a bit much to expect a repeat.\n\nThe New Year presents new challenges, with growth being an important one, the CEOs said. The industry\u2019s surplus is growing, with the increase in capacity possibly leading to increasing competitiveness on coverage terms and conditions.\n\nMany commercial insurance buyers are enjoying above average earnings, noted Peter Hancock, CEO of AIG\u2019s global property-casualty business. \u201cTheir high profits will make them more likely to self-insure in the coming year, taking business from traditional insurers,\u201d he said.\n\nFinancial performance was just one of a host of topics the executives fielded from moderator Leigh Ann Pusey, president and CEO of the American Insurance Association. Panelists also agreed that low catastrophe losses were a bit of a good break for the industry.\n\nGeneral Re CEO Franklin (Tad) Montross said there were two one-in-1,000 events: flooding in the Colorado mountains and severe hailstorms in Germany. \u201cBut those, as well as the biggest recorded typhoon in history\u2014Super Typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines\u2014didn\u2019t generate large insured losses,\u201d he said, noting that relatively few of the losses were insured.\n\nThe reason: too few people realize they need insurance, according to Michael Sapnar, president and CEO of reinsurer Transatlantic Holdings. One example is California, where fewer than half those who should have earthquake coverage purchase it. \u201cInsurers need to find a way to sell coverage in those areas,\u201d he said.\n\nLast year\u2019s results were also buoyed by reductions of loss estimates from claims two or more years ago. That continued a trend over the past several years, but panelists agreed that trend is ready to peter out.\n\nThere was less agreement about the impact of alternative sources of capital. In the past few years, hedge funds and pension managers have gobbled up insurance-linked securities\u2014bonds that can default if a catastrophe strikes. The bonds often compete directly with reinsurers that write catastrophe business. Last fall, rates for cat business fell 10% or more thanks to the competition from cat bonds.\n\nThe movement showed \u201cthat competition works,\u201d said Daniel Glaser, president and CEO of Marsh & McLennan Cos., a major reinsurance broker. Faced with competition, Glaser said, reinsurers became innovative. \u201cThey tailored products to client needs. Quota share treaties were available where none had been, reinstatement terms improved, coverage broadened and reinsurers wrote multi-year treaties more frequently.\u201d\n\nTransatlantic\u2019s Sapnar didn\u2019t consider those actions innovations. He called them sure signs of a soft market. \u201cI\u2019ve done that,\u201d he said, recalling his own experience from the late 1990s. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve gotten killed for it.\u201d\n\nSapnar pointed out that his firm wrote a three-year deal this year; the first in almost a decade. Sapnar wasn\u2019t sour on the cat bond trend. \u201cReinsurers help underwrite or manage many of the securities, and their emergence helps counteract the contraction in the number of reinsurers over the past 20 years,\u201d he noted.\n\n\u201cBefore, the catastrophe market was like an inverted pyramid,\u201d said Sapnar. \u201cMany insurers bought reinsurance from the same reinsurers. In essence the cat risk was being concentrated in relatively few hands. Now, the ILS market turns the pyramid into an hourglass. Money flows to reinsurers, then gets dispersed into the capital markets.\u201d\n\nWhether it\u2019s good or bad, though, is a matter of perspective, noted Stuart Henderson, president and CEO of Western National Insurance Group, a Midwest mutual. \u201cAs a buyer, you\u2019ve got to love the reinsurance world currently.\u201d\n\nWhile the panelists agreed that insurance-linked securities have become an important force, they agreed less on whether the securities would be around a few years from now. On one hand, the number of bonds being issued has mushroomed. But bond buyers could get skittish if a major catastrophe causes a string of defaults.\n\nMontross compared the nascent market with collateralized debt obligations (CDOs), the complex financial instruments whose abuse helped drive the 2008 financial crisis. \u201cBack then, CDO proponents hailed the same qualities praised about cat bonds today,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIf we were at a pension [fund] convention 10 years ago, we\u2019d be talking about CDOs and CDOs squared,\u201d he added. \u201cWe\u2019d be calling it a good asset class, and we\u2019d be calling it an uncorrelated asset.\u201d\n\nIn the end, chances for a good year will depend on the economy. Several panelists pointed out that most parts of the economy seem to be picking up, which would create more exposures for the industry to cover.\n\nBut Kishore Ponnavolu, president of MetLife Auto & Home thought the situation was a bit more complex. \u201cWe\u2019ve made a very nice recovery over the past couple of years,\u201d he said, \u201cbut that only brings the economy back to where it was in 2008. So we\u2019ve basically lost six years in the process.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Property/casualty insurers will be hard-pressed to repeat the industry\u2019s stellar 2013 performance, a panel of industry chief executives agreed at the...", "generator": "WordPress 4.3.1", "og": {"site_name": "IFAwebnews.com", "description": "Property/casualty insurers will be hard-pressed to repeat the industry\u2019s stellar 2013 performance, a panel of industry chief executives agreed at the\u2026", "title": "Executives expect challenges in growth, price for P/C insurers in \u2018post-crisis\u2019 era", "url": "http://ifawebnews.com/2014/01/24/executives-expect-challenges-in-growth-price-for-pc-insurers-in-post-crisis-era/", "image": "http://ifawebnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Glaser-Daniel.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary"}, "article": {"published_time": "2014-01-24T17:14:11+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-01-27T15:41:02+00:00"}, "verify-v1": "Fve8IDDdj94aX4Ar18+v33qGgAesGnY2YiqbnR5P17I="}, "article_summary": "The reason: too few people realize they need insurance, according to Michael Sapnar, president and CEO of reinsurer Transatlantic Holdings.\n\u201cBefore, the catastrophe market was like an inverted pyramid,\u201d said Sapnar.\nFinancial performance was just one of a host of topics the executives fielded from moderator Leigh Ann Pusey, president and CEO of the American Insurance Association.\nThe movement showed \u201cthat competition works,\u201d said Daniel Glaser, president and CEO of Marsh & McLennan Cos., a major reinsurance broker.\n\u201cTheir high profits will make them more likely to self-insure in the coming year, taking business from traditional insurers,\u201d he said."}
