Amarillo, TX - Some Buffalo Wild Wings customers are noticing an extra charge on their bill that up until now has not been seen in the Panhandle.



The Buffalo Wild Wings restaurants in both Amarillo and Lubbock recently attempted to pass their employee health insurance costs on to their customers by adding an Affordable Care Act surcharge.

The two percent surcharge started appearing on bills January 1--the same day businesses with 100 or more employees were mandated to provide insurance to at least 70 percent of their full-time employees.

The Howard Restaurant Group who owns the Buffalo Wild Wings said it implemented the surcharge instead of cutting employee hours or raising prices. "Due to the Affordable Healthcare Act and its requirement of healthcare coverage to all full-time employees, our restaurant group has decided instead of cutting employee hours and raising food and beverage prices, to implement a two percent surcharge on all guest checks to offset the cost of the federally mandated employee healthcare with the least possible impact to the consumer."

However, the surcharge did not last long.

After being contacted by NewsChannel 10 on Wednesday, Heather Leiferman, the director of public relations for Buffalo Wild Wings, Inc, released a statement saying, "The health care surcharge at our franchised Buffalo Wild Wings in Lubbock and Amarillo has been removed. We regret any inconvenience this may have caused. Our priority is to always provide our guests a great experience every day so they can enjoy our wings, beer and sports."

Some economic experts said even though you may not see a charge from a business up front, you are still fronting the bill because companies are raising prices elsewhere.
