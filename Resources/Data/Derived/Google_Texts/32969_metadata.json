We have already seen the reactions of the NCAA, GenCon, The Disciples of Christ, and Salesforce. Yelp and Eli Lilly have also expressed disappointment in the law.\n\nWe can now add to the list Angie\u2019s List \u2013 you may have seen their commercials.\n\nThey are a word-of-mouth business rating network. And this one is going to cost Indiana more than just hurt feelings. It is going to cost Hoosiers some money \u2013 and about 1,000 jobs.\n\nApparently, word-of-mouth is that Indiana is not the place to be. So in the spirit of the free marketplace so touted by Republicans, Angie\u2019s List has announced that they\u2019re going to delay going forward with a $40 million expansion to their Indiana headquarters.\n\nOf course, the egregiously misnamed Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA) is touted as a protection for businesses, but this is one business that is not amused.\n\nThis is what co-founder and Chief Executive Bill Oesterle had to say:\n\n\u201cWe are putting the \u2018Ford Building Project\u2019 on hold until we fully understand the implications of the Freedom Restoration Act on our employees, both current and future. Angie\u2019s List is open to all and discriminates against none and we are hugely disappointed in what this bill represents.\u201d\n\nAnd what timing. Turning the old Ford assembly plant into a new office space was to have had its groundbreaking in a few days.\n\nIronically, Oesterle, a Republican supported Pence for governor.\n\nOn Saturday he had this to say:\n\nLook, I\u2019m very proud to be a Republican. I\u2019m concerned about the direction that the legislature and governor have chosen to go here. \u2026 I\u2019m concerned that very valid input around this type of legislation is not being heard in the Statehouse.\n\nOf course it\u2019s not being heard. Did you hear the one about the Republican Congresswoman who asked her constituents to post their \u201cObamacare horror stories\u201d on Facebook and was swamped with success stories praising the president\u2019s healthcare law instead? Did she change her mind about the law? Her answer: because she got only success stories, she used recycled stories from a GOP website to denounce Obamacare anyway.\n\nThey don\u2019t want to hear the truth. Until Oesterle and other Republicans realize the full extent of the problem, it is going to continue to be a problem, and the people of states like Indiana are going to suffer for it. Pence\u2019s corporate owners will fly him to basketball games, an option not open to most Hoosiers.\n\nOesterle seems to understand the source of the hate, at least, pointing to a photograph of Pence signing the RFRA into law:\n\nI signed SEA 101 today to ensure religious liberty is fully protected under IN law http://t.co/vCOASZBZnH pic.twitter.com/CMFJh6aLDx \u2014 Governor Mike Pence (@GovPenceIN) March 26, 2015\n\nThat photograph told me everything I needed to know. I\u2019ve been on the other side of this issue with them for a long time, going back to the governor\u2019s (Daniels\u2019) campaign. That\u2019s when I first became exposed to those people. The most prominent three figures standing directly behind the governor were those three individuals.\n\nHe was speaking of Micah Clark of the homophobic and anti-Semitic American Family Association of Indiana (see some of his hateful quotes at GLAAD), Eric Miller of the ironically-named Advance America (whom NUVO calls the \u201cmost powerful man in the Indiana statehouse\u201d), and Curt Smith of the Indiana Family Institute (see some of his hateful quotes at GLAAD) \u2013 all vocal supporters of religious tyranny and discrimination in the state of Indiana.\n\nMaybe we should thank Pence for pulling these people out of the shadows in a way we can only dream of doing here. By all means, let\u2019s have some more photo ops. As many of us have observed, the GOP is a gift that keeps on giving. It\u2019s a pity the mainstream media refuses to receive.\n\nThe worst of it is \u2013 and I know this as a fact because I have family there \u2013 Republican Hoosiers will blame Obama for their economic woes, not the fact that they live in a Red State. They haven\u2019t, and they steadfastly refuse, to learn a thing.\n\nEven as the denunciations continue:\n\nYou may have noticed on Friday that Apple CEO Tim Cook, of the company that the phones that many of those Hoosier Republican bigots no doubt use \u2013 and who also just happens to be gay \u2013 has also come out against the law, tweeting,\n\nApple is open for everyone. We are deeply disappointed in Indiana's new law and calling on Arkansas Gov. to veto the similar #HB1228. \u2014 Tim Cook (@tim_cook) March 27, 2015\n\nOn Saturday, there came a joint statement from the NBA, WNBA, and the Indiana Pacers and Indiana Fever joining the NCAA in denouncing the RFRA:\n\nThe game of basketball is grounded in long established principles of inclusion and mutual respect. We will continue to ensure that all fans, players and employees feel welcome at all NBA and WNBA events in Indiana and elsewhere.\n\nPacers and Fever owner Herb Simon had this to say, and it is not something Mike Pence wanted to hear:\n\nThe Indiana Pacers, Indiana Fever and Bankers Life Fieldhouse have the strongest possible commitment to inclusion and non-discrimination on any basis. Everyone is always welcome at Bankers Life Fieldhouse. That has always been the policy from the very beginning of the Simon family\u2019s involvement and it always will be.\n\nYou have to wonder at what point enough will be enough. It is up to the people of Indiana \u2013 Hoosiers \u2013 to affect change in the next election. The people they voted into office are taking Indiana down a dark and troubling path, to a place America thought it had escaped from two hundred years ago, when bigotry was commonplace.\n\nWe have slowly, if imperfectly, and in fits and starts, but sometimes with glorious success like the Emancipation Proclamation, the Civil Rights Act, and other shining deeds, continued to crawl out of that gutter. We might never reach our exceptions and our hopes, but we continue to try.\n\nIn a single act, the state of Indiana has committed itself to 13th century-style bigotry and persecution of minorities in the name of religion. It is illegal, un-American, and it is wrong, and if it is to end, Hoosiers will have to wake up and realize they\u2019ve put fascists in charge of their state. All we can do meanwhile, is fly over the accursed place, or if you have to stop, enter only places that bear this sign:", "article_metadata": {"description": "Angie's List is the latest to stand up in opposition to Indiana's discriminatory RFRA, and this one could cost Indiana 1,000 jobs", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "author": "Hrafnkell Haraldsson", "og": {"site_name": "Politicus USA", "description": "Angie's List is the latest to stand up in opposition to Indiana's discriminatory RFRA, and this one could cost Indiana 1,000 jobs", "title": "Angie's List Halts Indiana HQ Expansion in Response to Religious Tyranny Act", "url": "http://www.politicususa.com/2015/03/29/angies-list-halts-indiana-hq-expansion-response-religious-tyranny-act.html", "image": "http://15130-presscdn-0-89.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/angie-hicks.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-03-29T07:57:37+00:00", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 523732690, "app_id": 113462415332922, "pages": 186473214703370}, "keywords": "Featured News,Issues,AFA,American Family Association,Angie's List,discrimination,Indiana,Religious Freedom Restoration Act,RFRA,politicususa,liberal,politics,sarah jones,jason easley,barack obama,hillary clinton,bernie sanders,msnbc,media", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/PoliticusUSA", "section": "Issues", "published_time": "2015-03-29T07:57:34+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-03-29T07:57:37+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "AFA, American Family Association, Angie's List, discrimination, Indiana, Religious Freedom Restoration Act, RFRA"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdcd04\"", "article_summary": "It is up to the people of Indiana \u2013 Hoosiers \u2013 to affect change in the next election.\nWe can now add to the list Angie\u2019s List \u2013 you may have seen their commercials.\nThe once great state of Indiana is becoming a fly-over state, as freedom-loving Americans flee Hoosier theocracy for saner climes.\nIn a single act, the state of Indiana has committed itself to 13th century-style bigotry and persecution of minorities in the name of religion.\nSo in the spirit of the free marketplace so touted by Republicans, Angie\u2019s List has announced that they\u2019re going to delay going forward with a $40 million expansion to their Indiana headquarters."}
