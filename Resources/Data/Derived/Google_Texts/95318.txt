TOP TALKER – N.Y. Times A1, “Leaving a Tip: A Custom in Need of Changing?” – “Critic’s Notebook” by restaurant critic Pete Wells: “[]It is irrational, outdated, ineffective, confusing, prone to abuse and sometimes discriminatory. The people who take care of us in restaurants deserve a better system, and so do we. That’s one reason we pay attention when a restaurant tries another way, as Sushi Yasuda in Manhattan started to do two months ago. Raising most of its prices, it appended this note to credit card slips: ‘Following the custom in Japan, Sushi Yasuda’s service staff are fully compensated by their salary. Therefore gratuities are not accepted.’ Sushi Yasuda joins other restaurants that have done away with tips, replacing them with either a surcharge (Atera and Chef’s Table at Brooklyn Fare in New York; Next and Alinea in Chicago; Coi and Chez Panisse in the San Francisco Bay Area) or prices that include the cost of service (Per Se in New York and the French Laundry in Healdsburg, Calif.). …

“These restaurants are numerous enough and important enough to suggest that a tip-reform movement is under way. … Front-of-house workers are suing one respected restaurant after another, … accusing them of playing fast and loose with the laws on tips. The charges include sharing tips with workers who aren’t eligible for them and making tipped employees spend too much time on what is called sidework, like folding napkins between meals. … Some owners now think they can avoid the suits by eliminating tips.” http://nyti.ms/13dbcMk

DRIVING THE DAY: President Clinton will speech on the Affordable Care Act at 11 a.m. ET at his presidential library in Little Rock. Speech will stream at www.clintonfoundation.org and www.whitehouse.gov/clinton-aca-speech.

--A White House official: “President Clinton's speech is part of ongoing outreach efforts around the Affordable Care Act about a month ahead of Marketplaces opening. These efforts will help to ensure that Americans know that there will be a simple way to get health insurance that will fit your needs, lifestyle, and budget at any income level, starting this fall. President Obama, senior administration officials, and wide range of stakeholders including DJs, librarians, faith leaders, pharmacies, celebrities, and insurance companies are working to ensure that Americans know about the new health insurance options that will be available in the new Marketplaces."

ABOUT LAST NIGHT – “Jon Stewart returns to 'The Daily Show,’” by AP Television Writer David Bauder: “]T[he shaggy beard he grew over the summer is gone. … The … host quickly referenced stories he missed -- Paula Deen, Anthony Weiner's alter ego ‘Carlos Danger’ and Miley Cyrus' sultry MTV dance -- then took up the challenge of trying to make comedy and social commentary out of the Syrian poison gas attack. … ‘America taking military action against a Middle East regime … It's like I never left.’ After showing Secretary of State Kerry refer to ‘signatures of sarin gas,’ … Stewart launched into a mock commercial for ‘Signature of Sarin’ perfume. … He played … tape of … pundits saying that military action against Syria is necessary because the United States would look weak … ‘Oh, right … We have to bomb Syria because we're in the seventh grade.’ … [His first guest was] the head of the United Nation's relief effort in Jordan, taking care of refugees from Syria that have now exceeded two million.”

SYRIA UPDATE IN 1 PARAGRAPH -- Congressional support: Speaker Boehner announced he will back the president on Syria. … House Majority Leader Cantor released a statement of support. … House Minority Leader Pelosi wrote a letter to her caucus urging support. …Senate Majority Leader Reid’s office indicated that he believes he has the votes to override a filibuster. … House Minority Whip Hoyer issued a statement backing “the President’s call for authorizing limited but decisive military action.” … Advocates who support: AIPAC … Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations … Anti-Defamation League … former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.

--FLOODING THE ZONE: After Obama’s news conference from Sweden, Secretary Hagel and General Dempsey will hold a Senate Armed Services Committee classified briefing at 9 a.m. Also at 9 a.m., Secretary Kerry and Director Clapper will testify at a Senate Foreign Relations Committee classified hearing. At noon, Secretary Kerry, Secretary Hagel and General Dempsey will testify at a House Foreign Affairs Committee open hearing.

THE PLAYERS:

--“Nancy Pelosi’s Test,” by Ginger Gibson, with Manu Raju: “With a majority of House Republicans unlikely to support President Obama’s use-of-force resolution, Pelosi’s Democrats will be key to passing an authorization of force resolution … It’s a somewhat unusual position for House Democrats, who have been only marginally important since losing the House majority in 2010. But if they joined with a handful of Republicans — including House Speaker Boehner — to approve a Syria strike, they would be following a pattern that worked earlier in the year when Democrats helped Republicans pass the fiscal cliff deal and aid for victims of Hurricane Sandy. Democratic aides are already pushing back at the idea that the future of the resolution lies on their shoulders, arguing that the House GOP majority should take responsibility. But that won’t change the narrative if there is a less than robust showing by the Democratic caucus. …

“The House Democratic leadership insists that it won’t whip the vote, or try to pressure members into siding with the president. An informal survey will be taken to determine how many votes for a military strike exist. But that doesn’t mean they won’t be working behind the scenes to persuade lawmakers. The House Democratic leadership is making the case that the vote isn’t about war — emphasizing that this isn’t another Iraq — but about humanitarian aid, an appeal much more likely to win favor with anti-war Democrats. … Pelosi sent a letter to her members on Tuesday afternoon appealing for their support. … ‘This is a matter of national, regional, and global security.’” http://politi.co/17E2uWU

--“Marco Rubio shifts direction on Syria,” by Manu Raju: “For much of the last two years, Marco Rubio has been banging the drum on Syria: Demanding U.S. intervention to knock the Assad regime from power. Now, the senator has taken a different tack: The administration has missed the boat. How the Florida Republican has evolved on the issue is emblematic of the difficulties President Obama faces in winning congressional approval of military action in Syria, particularly among Republicans. It also shows the difficult line GOP presidential contenders like Rubio must balance in trying to project a sense of American military might without turning off conservatives skeptical about following Obama’s lead on a war. Indeed, the Syria vote is turning out to be the first big foreign policy test of the 2016 campaign, as prospective presidential contenders like Rubio stake out their positions on the most controversial – and consequential — vote of the 113th Congress so far.

“Since winning election on a tea party platform in 2010, Rubio has been a proponent of a more aggressive foreign policy, breaking from fellow tea party favorites and potential 2016 rivals like Ted Cruz and Rand Paul, who have argued for a more limited American role overseas. … Unlike Cruz and Paul, neither of whom believe that military action is necessary in Syria, Rubio argues what happens in Syria is ‘vital’ to the national security interest of the United States, given the Assad regime’s ties to Iran and terrorism groups. But like Cruz and Paul, Rubio appears likely to vote against the resolution authorizing force against Syria. At the hearing Tuesday, Rubio attacked the administration for making a choice to ‘lead from behind’ on Syria [and said] that had the administration heeded the calls he and others made two years ago to arm the Syrian rebels, it wouldn’t be in the predicament it is.” http://politi.co/14iKIM7

--BUT, BUT, BUT … Dan Senor predicts on “Morning Joe” that Rubio will eventually vote FOR authorization: “I think Rubio will come around. I think he's frustrated, as Republicans are. … Republicans were frustrated that Clinton acted late in the Balkans. You can come up with all these criticisms. But it's better to do something than not do something at all. … Marco will be fine. … I have confidence that Marco will be there.”

--RUBIO to CNN’s Jake Tapper, who had a live special at 11 last night: “"The large number of radical Islamists who now find themselves in Syria means that if Assad were to fall – if he stays in power, that's obviously bad, because it empowers Iran, and so forth – but if he falls, it's also possible it could trigger a second civil war.”

--“Hillary Clinton’s Syria dilemma,” by Maggie Haberman and Elizabeth Titus: “Hillary Clinton has answered calls that she pick a side in the Syria debate. But the former Secretary of State’s brief statement Tuesday backing President Obama’s campaign for a military strike won’t be the last time she’s asked to talk about the potentially sensitive issue. Clinton pressed during her time at Foggy Bottom to arm some Syrian rebels to combat the regime of Bashar Assad. … Clinton was seen as one of the more hawkish voices in the Obama administration and now needs to demonstrate to a liberal base that she learned from her 2002 vote authorizing the Iraq war and her carefully-calibrated walk away from it during her 2008 campaign. …

“‘I think Mrs. Clinton finds herself in the middle of a very ironic dilemma,’ said Bruce Riedel, of the Brookings Institution … ‘She probably lost the nomination for the presidency in 2008 because Barack Obama had spoken out about a stupid war and now he’s put her in the place where she either supports him or speaks out against it. From a political standpoint I think she’s in a tough place.’ Clinton’s brief initial comments on Syria, made through an aide, came a week before the ex-Secretary of State is to give a speech at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia – the first in a series policy addresses … Clinton owned a piece of the Syria puzzle while at State, as one former administration official put it. It is much harder to attack her to an operation taking place months after she left – but it opens the door for familiar criticism from her opponents over her tenure at Foggy Bottom.” http://politi.co/15y9FnC

HOT NEW NATIONAL-SECURITY FIRM: BEACON GLOBAL STRATEGIES (BGS) -- “Clinton Allies Join Bush Alum To Form New Consulting Group,” by Zachary Fryer-Biggs of Defense News: Hillary “Clinton’s longtime spokesman Philippe Reines and one-time national security adviser turned Assistant Secretary of State Andrew Shapiro are teaming with Jeremy Bash and [J.] Michael Allen to launch the group. Bash spent years as chief of staff at both the CIA and Pentagon for former Defense Secretary Leon Panetta, a close Clinton ally. [Allen and Bash] worked together in a variety of roles while Allen was a White House staffer for President George W. Bush and as staff director of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. … [Bash said: ‘W]e’ve all spent the better part of the last decade in government, mostly in the national security arena.’ … [T]hey have quietly set up a consulting group built on providing advice to companies, primarily defense contractors, focused on international defense business as well as cyber, although their first client was Bash’s former boss, Panetta. …

“[The group’s] client list … now surpasses a dozen, and [the principals] spent part of last week meeting with an architect to go over plans for new office space set to be ready in November. Beacon won’t name the companies on that list because of nondisclosure agreements. … The firm started to coalesce in April but didn’t get fully off the ground until Aug. 6, the day after Allen left his job in Congress and officially joined, helped by seed funding from Claude Fontheim of Fontheim International, another consulting firm. The other three departed their administration positions earlier in the year. .. In their new space, one of the offices is being converted into a room for their combined six kids to play. Building a firm while that firm’s principals might want to return to government creates its own obstacles, such as the politics of certain clients. …

“Beacon has already turned down clients and won’t work for foreign governments, Reines said, and despite the interest in future government jobs, the principals aren’t simply biding their time for an offer, alluding to the presidential elections for which Clinton may be a candidate in 2016. ‘In terms of going back in, I think we all want to, but we also know that life doesn’t necessarily work out so cutely that you have to worry about three years from now’ … There also is a push to stay in the national security space, while promoting bipartisanship. … ‘I worked for eight years for President Bush, and the last two years for the Republican Party,’ Allen said. ‘Everybody we’ve talked to has almost a sense of relief on their face. They’re glad that we’ve got both Republicans and Democrats.’ …

“The group is being set up to focus on several hot areas in national security: international sales, potential vertical integration in the defense industry, and cyber. But the firm is clear that it will help only with items that align with US policy. … And since the group has no plans to do any lobbying, that help will be concentrated in strategic thinking, such as how to handle a complicated weapons sales picture in the Middle East, Shapiro said.” http://bit.ly/1ee21zK

--PLAYBOOK BACKSTORY: For 133 days -- a D.C. record – the embryonic firm (including associates Ashley Woolheater and Sarah Davey) flew under the radar. BGS found its soon-to-be office building through Kurt Campbell, who set up The Asia Group after leaving State in January. The guys loved the space, and the firms will be next-door neighbors when they move in. The guys are putting together an advisory group of people they respect and who have been mentors, and who they will continue to seek guidance from. The firm’s user-friendly website, www.beaconglobalstrategies.com, was created by a Massachusetts developer, Initial Design Group. www.initialdesigngroup.com

HAPPENING NEXT WEEK – “Aides: Chris Christie not meeting Rand Paul,” by Maggie Haberman: “Christie won’t be joining Sen. Rand Paul and U.S. Senate hopeful Steve Lonegan at a New Jersey rally next week, … citing a scheduling conflict. Christie has a long-scheduled trip planned with his wife Mary Pat for her 50th birthday, a campaign aide said. … Paul, who was already planning a fundraiser with Lonegan, is also planning to make a public appearance with him — but officials had invited Paul’s recent national security sparring partner, Christie, to attend. Lonegan, who ran against Christie for governor in 2009, has recently praised him as very helpful to his campaign, but also sided with Paul in a dispute over Hurricane Sandy aid.”

MEDIAWATCH – CNN Worldwide President Jeff Zucker; Meredith Artley, managing editor of CNN Digital; and Washington Bureau Chief Sam Feist will announce on the 9 a.m. editorial call: “PETER HAMBY will be joining the digital team as a national political reporter. Think digital correspondent a la Kelly Wallace . … His specialty is national politics -- the hot campaigns, candidates and characters. The stuff outside of the [D]istrict. He's not often found at his desk. Hamby will use his powerful social presence (over 40,000 fans and political junkies follow him on Twitter), swift and voice-packed writing skills… and his on-air experience to deliver scoops on TV and create a cross-platform conversation in text and video.”

--JIM SCIUTTO, ABC alumnus and chief of staff to the U.S. ambassador to China, named CNN chief national security correspondent, effective immediately: “The announcement was made … by Sam Feist, Washington bureau chief and senior vice president. … Sciutto was ABC News’ senior foreign correspondent, based in primarily in London and later, from Washington. … His extensive reporting included dozens of assignments from inside Iraq, Afghanistan and Iran. He is the author of a book based on his own experiences in the Middle East, ‘Against Us: The New Face of America’s Enemies in the Muslim World.’ … Most recently, Sciutto served as chief of staff and senior advisor to the U.S. Ambassador to China, Gary Locke. … He graduated from Yale University with a bachelor’s degree in Chinese history.”

SPORTS BLINK – COACH DEFENDS JOHNNY FOOTBALL – Fort Worth Star-Telegram’s Jimmy Burch, in College Station: “Texas A&M football coach Kevin Sumlin … fired back Tuesday at college football analysts who accused quarterback Johnny Manziel of ignoring his coach during a fourth-quarter sideline exchange. Outsiders also raised questions about the internal discipline of a program that had eight players miss all or part of the Rice game while serving suspensions. [Sumlin said] he was ‘shocked’ by the national narrative about A&M, driven primarily by ESPN analysts who viewed Manziel's action as a show of disrespect toward Sumlin … ESPN analysts Mark May and Matt Millen -- among legions of others – espous[ed] opinions Sunday that Manziel displayed his selfish side when he bumped into, then walked past, Sumlin on the sideline after drawing an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty. Sumlin told a much different version Tuesday, saying he greeted the 2012 Heisman Trophy winner with some strong words and Manziel was wise to remain silent.

“‘When he came off the field, I made two statements to him; neither one of which should he have responded to,’ said Sumlin, who benched Manziel after the penalty. ‘They weren't questions. They were direct statements that I can't repeat right now.’ … May, who described Manziel as ‘a very selfish player’ who acted like ‘a 6-year-old not getting his favorite toy’ in a season debut marked by hand gestures toward opponents and the sideline encounter with Sumlin. … [T]eammates … clarified Manziel's ‘cashing out’ hand gesture as something players have used in celebrations the past two seasons to show they are reaping the rewards of their time investment. … His yapping and hand gestures made him an easy target for … a 15-yard-penalty that could prove costly in a matchup against top-ranked Alabama [on Sept. 14]. … ‘He plays with a lot of emotion and a lot of passion,’ … Sumlin said. ‘Because of that, he gets in a gray area. It's our job as coaches to keep that passion and energy going but make it positive. Is it a challenge at times? You bet, it's a challenge.’” http://bit.ly/1dFWEL4

KATIE COURIC ENGAGED to JOHN MOLNER: PEOPLE magazine says she “ecstatically accepted a proposal from her boyfriend of nearly two years, banker John Molner, 50. … Molner popped the question [over the holiday weekend] with a spectacular diamond ring at sunset on the beach in East Hampton, N.Y. … Couric and Molner, who is head of mergers and acquisitions at Brown Brothers Harriman, first went public with their romance in April 2012.
