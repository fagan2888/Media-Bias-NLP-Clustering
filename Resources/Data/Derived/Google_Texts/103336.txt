It has been a week characterized by extreme weather events: Intense heat and wildfires in California, and tornados touching down in Ohio, Florida and just moments ago in North Carolina. (Thomas Friedman characterizes these events as “global weirding” — or intensified weather events that are the result of climate change.)

In the calm after a tornado in Cedarville, Ohio, a meteorologist found an unlikely survivor, in the debris of a smashed barn. WHIO reporter, Rich Wirdzek found a small kitten shaking in the rubble. He took the kitten and wrapped in a jacket and kept it warm in the news-van.
