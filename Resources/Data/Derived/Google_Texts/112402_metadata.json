'If at all possible, we must interpret the Act in a way that is consistent with the former, and avoids the latter.'\n\nThe contentious four words that inspired the case 'can fairly be read consistent with what we see as Congress's plan, and that is the reading we adopt,' he concluded.\n\nSeveral sections of the Affordable Care Act indicate that consumers can claim tax credits no matter where they live.\n\nNo member of Congress said subsidies would be limited, and several states said in a separate brief to the court that they had no inkling they had to set up their own exchange for their residents to get tax credits.\n\nBut Jonathan Gruber, the MIT economist who provided the statistical model the law was based on, said on several occasions that the law was written in a way that states would have to launch insurance exchanges in order to secure subsidies for their citizens.\n\nBOOYAH: President Barack Obama took a victory lap after his signature health insurance law was upheld by the Supreme Court. 'The Affordable Care Act is here to stay,' he declared from the Rose Garden of the White House this morning\n\n'JUBILANT': Democrats on Capitol HIll including House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (center) and Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (at podium) also took victory laps on Thursday\n\nObama said the favorable decision proved once and for all that healthcare 'is not a privilege for a few, but a right for all' - a sentiment Democratic lawmaker echoed in their own statements.\n\n'Today is a victory for hard-working Americans all across this country,' the president said.\n\nSince the law took effect, 16 million uninsured Americans have signed up for medical insurance, or one in three Americans who did not have health insurance previously. That includes the 8.7 million people who are receiving an average subsidy of $272 per month to help pay their insurance premiums.\n\n'WORDS NO LONGER HAVE MEANING': Justice Scalia's scathing dissent Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, representing the conservative wing of the court, penned an unusually aggressive opinion. Below are some of his most noteworthy lines: 'Words no longer have meaning if an Exchange that is not established by a State is \"established by the State\".'\n\n'We should start calling this law SCOTUScare \u2026 The Supreme Court of the United States favors some laws over others, and is prepared to do whatever it takes to uphold and assist its favorites.'\n\n'Under all the usual rules of interpretation, in short, the Government should lose this case. But normal rules of interpretation seem always to yield to the overriding principle of the present Court: The Affordable Care Act must be saved.'\n\n'The Court\u2019s decision reflects the philosophy that judges should endure whatever interpretive distortions it takes in order to correct a supposed flaw in the statutory machinery.'\n\n'The Court forgets that ours is a government of laws and not of men. That means we are governed by the terms of our laws, not by the unenacted will of our lawmakers.'\n\n'That is something we can all be proud of,' Obama said of the declining rate of the uninsured, proclaiming minutes later. 'This law is working.'\n\nFive years in, it's time to stop treating Obamacare as legislation under debate or 'as a political football,' he said. 'This is healthcare in America.'\n\n'We\u2019ve got more work to do. But what we\u2019re not going to do is unravel what has now been woven into the fabric of America,' he said, putting the law's critics on notice.\n\n'And my greatest hope is that rather than keep refighting battles that have been settled again and again and again, I can work with Republicans and Democrats to move forward. Let\u2019s join together, make health care in America even better.'\n\nConcluding his remarks, Obama said that 'this was a good day for America.'\n\nHe turned to Vice President Joe Biden, standing just behind him and to his left, and shook his hand as the White House staff gathered in the Rose Garden broke out into applause.\n\nThe two men promptly walked back into the Oval Office together, Obama's hand resting on his lieutenant's back, ignoring questions being hurled at them by the press.\n\nBefore the president had even taken the podium, the Republican Party fired a broadside at the White House, calling Obamacare a 'reckless law' and noting that no lawmakers in the GOP voted for its passage.\n\nOrrin Hatch, the Senate's most senior lawmaker, argued that the decision 'allows the Obama Administration simply to ignore the law and to implement its own preferred policy instead.'\n\nHouse Speaker John Boehner said, 'ObamaCare is fundamentally broken,' and 'today\u2019s ruling doesn\u2019t change that fact.'\n\nRepublicans 'will continue our efforts to repeal the law and replace it with patient-centered solutions that meet the needs of seniors, small business owners, and middle-class families,' he said.\n\nKentucky Sen. Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, also said the ruling 'won't change Obamacare's spectacular flops, from humiliating website debacles to the total collapse of exchanges in states run by the law's loudest cheerleaders.'\n\n'Today's ruling won't change the skyrocketing costs in premiums, deductibles, and co-pays that have hit the middle class so hard over the last few years,' his statement read.\n\n'Today is a victory for hard-working Americans all across this country,' the president said\n\nConcluding his remarks Obama said, 'So this was a good day for America. Let\u2019s get back to work.' He then turned to Vice President Joe Biden, who was standing just behind him and to his left, and shook his hand\n\nNO QUESTIONS: The two men promptly walked back into the Oval Office together, Obama's hand resting on his lieutenant's back, ignoring questions being hurled at them by the press\n\nAlready, House Republicans have tried, unsuccessfully, to repeal the law more than 50 times.\n\nDemocrats, especially in the U.S. Senate, breathed a sign of relief.\n\n'The Supreme Court decision ensures 6.4 million people will keep their coverage; it was legally the right decision and substantively the right outcome,' New York Democratic Sen. Chuch Schumer said in a statement.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, who shepherded the Affordable Care Act through the House of Representatives during her last term as speaker, opened a press conference Thursday by saying she was 'so jubilant about this. It's a victory for common sense and for all American families.'\n\nPelosi predicted that Republicans might still try to chip away at the law.\n\n'They may try this, that, or the other thing,' she said, 'but the more time goes by, the more people benefit from the Affordable Care Act and the more ridiculous they look.\"\n\nMaryland Rep. Chris Van Hollen called on lawmakers across the aisle to 'give up their numbskull quest to try to unravel the law.'\n\n'It\u2019s time to look to the future. I hope we can do that,' he said during an appearance on MSNBC.\n\nVirginia Sen. Tim Kaine, another Democrat, said the GOP was engaged in a 'heartless effort led by health care law opponents to push families \u2013 many of whom have insurance coverage for the first time - back into the ranks of the vulnerable uninsured.'\n\nVermont Democratic Sen. Patrick Leahy took a more somber approach.\n\n'Today's decision is a stark reminder of the power the Supreme Court\u2019s justices wield over Americans' everyday lives,' he said.\n\n'It matters greatly who serves on our Nation\u2019s highest court.'\n\nNINE WISE MEN AND WOMEN: The U.S. Supreme Court sided with the White House in a 6-3 decision\n\nThe White House meanwhile took a second victory lap on Thursday afternoon during its daily briefing with reporters.\n\nPress Secretary Josh Earnest proclaimed that the ruling, coupled with a vote today affirming the president's trade agenda, illustrated the effectiveness of president's leadership.\n\nHe focuses on a longer-term objective and keeps his focus there, Earnest said.\n\nThe West Wing spokesman indicated that even White House staff who have known him since he was a senator were impressed.\n\n'Both of these issues were aggressively pursued by the president,' he said, and he ultimately proved successful because of 'his laser-like focus' on helping the middle class. 'That is why he is so gratified today to see this progress.'\n\nTaunting the law's critics - and the press - he said that if the president had spent a lot of time reading the obituaries on his signature law, 'we probably wouldn't have made as much progress as we did.'\n\nThe 2012 challenge to the law took place in the midst of Obama's re-election campaign, when he touted the largest expansion of the social safety net since the advent of Medicare nearly a half-century earlier.\n\nBut at the time, the benefits of the Affordable Care Act were mostly in the future. Many of its provisions had yet to take effect.\n\nIn 2015, the landscape has changed, although the partisan and ideological divisions remain for a law that passed Congress in 2010 with no Republican votes.\n\n'Obamacare has never been accepted by the American people,' Wisconsin GOP Sen. Ron Johnson said Thursday. 'The harm that the law inflicts shows that the people were right.'\n\nTHE RUNNING OF THE INTERNS: In a time-worn tradition, news assistants dash out of the Supreme Court with news of decisions so their bosses can broadcast them. The Supreme Court forbids cameras and recording devices on days when decisions are released\n\nRepublicans will likely run heavily in the 2016 White House race on a message of repealing the law.\n\nWithin hours of the ruling Mike Huckabee had announced a 'Religious Liberty Town Hall Tour' of Iowa next week during which his campaign suggested he preach against the 'contentious gay marriage and health care rulings by the Supreme Court.'\n\n'America can't bow to judicial tyranny on health care or gay marriage,' Huckabee said in an afternoon op-ed in USA Today.\n\nThe high court has not handed down judgments on the gay marriage cases it heard this spring, but is expected to do so in the next several days before it adjourns for the fall.\n\nAfter today's ruling in favor of Obamacare, however, conservatives did not appear to be holding out much hope that the pending gay marriage ruling would swing their way.\n\nThe American Conservative Union blasted Roberts - who was appointed to the judicial body by Republican president George W. Bush - and said it was today 'reminded of why it is destructive to have activists on the Supreme Court who are empowered by their hubris to act as Judge, Senator and King.'\n\n'Chief Justice John Roberts now thinks it is his job to re-write the unambiguous language of the law to achieve a certain outcome: the radical Leftist dream of socialized medicine,' the group claimed.\n\nRoberts and the other justices who ruled in favor of the Obama administration 'have disgraced their office, sprayed graffiti on the Constitution, and set America on a path toward a constitutional crisis,' ACU chairman Matt Schlapp said.\n\nHe owes conservatives and America an 'apology,' Schalpp contended, for lying about his political agenda.\n\nThe American Enterprise Institute, a conservative, free-market based, think tank, said the ruling made clear that Obamacare cannot be defeated though a lawsuit.\n\n'Now, it's time for Obamacare opponents and partial critics to move on to the next play. That's in the political, not the judicial, arena,' AEI legal scholar Thomas Miller said. 'Elections, and following though on campaign promises, matter.'\n\nJeb Bush, the ex-governor of Florida and a front-runner for the GOP nomination, promised in a statement that the 'decision is not the end of the fight against Obamacare.'\n\n'As President of the United States, I would make fixing our broken health care system one of my top priorities,' Bush said. 'I will work with Congress to repeal and replace this flawed law with conservative reforms that empower consumers with more choices and control over their health care decisions.'\n\nThe Democratic National Committee meanwhile warned its supporters not to get complacent on the issue.\n\n'While we have a lot to celebrate today, we can't forget that the GOP has always been -- and is still, even though the Court has ruled twice that Obamacare is the law of the land -- single-mindedly focused on repealing this law that has helped so many Americans afford quality health insurance,' DNC chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz said in an email.\n\n'They're the reason we had to take this fight to our nation's highest court in the first place, and each and every one of their candidates for president has traveled around the country promising repeal.\n\nSchultz told them that while 'we can (and should!) take a moment to enjoy this, let's not forget that our Republican opposition just doesn't understand that this debate is over -- they're going to keep fighting to undo the progress we've made. We can't let that happen.'\n\nHillary Clinton, their likely nominee, said Thursday that 'anyone seeking to lead our country should stand up and support this decision.'", "article_metadata": {"Rating": "General", "news_keywords": "Supreme,Court,sides,White,House,Obamacare,rules,insurance,subsidies,ignoring,language,law", "original-source": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3139145/Supreme-Court-sides-White-House-Obamacare-rules-insurance-subsidies-ignoring-language-law.html", "doc-class": "Living Document", "twitter": {"description": "The massive win for the Obama administration is the second Supreme Court victory related to Obamacare since the law was passed along party lines in 2010.", "title": "BREAKING: Supreme Court sides with White House on Obamacare", "url": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3139145/Supreme-Court-sides-White-House-Obamacare-rules-insurance-subsidies-ignoring-language-law.html", "app": {"id": {"ipad": 400442503, "iphone": 384101264}}, "image": "http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2015/06/25/19/29F95F7C00000578-0-image-a-4_1435258147296.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "account_id": 15438913}, "robots": "noodp,noydir,all,noarchive", "al": {"android": {"url": "dailymail-fb://article/3139145/", "app_name": "Daily Mail Online", "package": "com.dailymail.online"}, "ios": {"url": "dailymail-fb://article/3139145/", "app_store_id": 384101264, "app_name": "MailOnline"}}, "msvalidate.01": "12E6B4B813EB44C9BFC8F6A21F1D01F5", "fb": {"app_id": 146202712090395}, "MSSmartTagsPreventParsing": "true", "articleid": 3139145, "divclasspage": "articlePage", "keywords": "Supreme,Court,sides,White,House,Obamacare,rules,insurance,subsidies,ignoring,language,law", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/DailyMail", "published_time": "2015-06-25T14:21:51.000Zyyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss z", "author": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/search.html?s=&authornamef=David+Martosko,+US+Political+Editor", "section": "News", "modified_time": "2015-06-25T21:29:05.000Zyyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss z", "tag": "Supreme Court sides White House Obamacare rules insurance subsidies ignoring language law"}, "verify-v1": "DXwlrsxbqxSv+FTFkWUfgflBvFJfx2YbNf/HmABrVyY=", "y_key": "1a7e912afbfcab2f", "og": {"site_name": "Mail Online", "description": "The massive win for the Obama administration is the second Supreme Court victory related to Obamacare since the law was passed along party lines in 2010.", "title": "BREAKING: Supreme Court sides with White House on Obamacare", "url": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3139145/Supreme-Court-sides-White-House-Obamacare-rules-insurance-subsidies-ignoring-language-law.html", "image": {"width": 636, "identifier": "http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2015/06/25/19/29F95F7C00000578-0-image-a-4_1435258147296.jpg", "height": 382}, "video": {"width": 636, "identifier": "http://video.dailymail.co.uk/video/bc/rtmp_uds/1418450360/2015/06/25/1418450360_4321859451001_4321609105001.mp4", "type": "video/mp4", "height": 358}, "type": "article"}, "channel": "News", "description": "The massive win for the Obama administration is the second Supreme Court victory related to Obamacare since the law was passed along party lines in 2010."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2c86\"", "article_summary": "NINE WISE MEN AND WOMEN: The U.S. Supreme Court sided with the White House in a 6-3 decisionThe White House meanwhile took a second victory lap on Thursday afternoon during its daily briefing with reporters.\n'WORDS NO LONGER HAVE MEANING': Justice Scalia's scathing dissent Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, representing the conservative wing of the court, penned an unusually aggressive opinion.\nBOOYAH: President Barack Obama took a victory lap after his signature health insurance law was upheld by the Supreme Court.\nThe West Wing spokesman indicated that even White House staff who have known him since he was a senator were impressed.\nSCOTUS is an acronym for Supreme Court of the United States."}
