And the Affordable Care Act (ACA) has added new complexities to health care benefits. That means more business for 2014 IPO stock Paycom Software (NYSE:PAYC), which provides cloud-based human capital management software covering everything from recruiting to retirement.\n\nThe Oklahoma City-based firm now also offers Enhanced ACA, a product to help companies comply with ObamaCare regulations.\n\nKey Fundamentals\n\nRevenue growth has moved higher in each of the last four reports. Paycom has delivered a few quarters of triple-digit earnings gains.\n\nFor the full year, analysts expect earnings to rise 61%, followed by a 38% gain in 2016.\n\nA 24% return on equity and a 73% five-year average EPS growth rate help Paycom earn IBD's highest possible Composite Rating, 99.\n\nInstitutional interest in the stock is reflected in its A- Accumulation/Distribution Rating and 1.5 up/down volume ratio, plus a steady rise in fund ownership in recent quarters.\n\nChart Analysis\n\nAfter going public in April 2014, Paycom formed two bases before shooting higher in November. It then formed a double bottom and is now working on a later-stage base-on-base pattern.\n\nPaycom has a history of stumbling after a breakout before eventually climbing higher. It happened in September, January and again in May.\n\nBut the stock has generally found support around its 10-week line.\n\nTrading within its latest base has tightened up, and its relative strength line has been trending higher into new high ground.\n\nThe buy point is 39.85, 10 cents above the peak on the left.\n\nSee related video at Investors.com/ibdtv.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "http://www1.ibdcd.com/images/IBD_Logo_50x50.jpg", "description": "Already a leader in cloud-based human capital management software, Paycom is seeing new opportunities as companies struggle with Affordable Care Act rules.", "news_keywords": "Paycom Software, cloud-based human capital management sofware, ObamaCare stocks to buy, Affordable Care Act regulations, complying with ACA, base-on-base, how to read stock charts, IBD Stock Analysis", "p": {"domain_verify": "fdf942e4ea215fafa65b5d9c35f29da9"}, "og": {"site_name": "Investor's Business Daily", "description": "Already a leader in cloud-based human capital management software, Paycom is seeing new opportunities as companies struggle with Affordable Care Act rules.", "title": "ObamaCare Compliance Rules Pay Off For Paycom", "url": "http://education.investors.com/ibd-stock-analysis/061915-758155-paycom-nears-buy-point.aspx", "image": "http://services.investors.com/image/ISA_150622.png.cms", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Already a leader in cloud-based human capital management software, Paycom is seeing new opportunities as companies struggle with Affordable Care Act rules.", "title": "ObamaCare Compliance Rules Pay Off For Paycom", "image": {"src": "http://services.investors.com/image/ISA_150622.png.cms"}, "site": "@IBDinvestors", "card": "summary_large_image", "account_id": 21328656}, "msvalidate.01": "A6A2E31D998968BEDD13CEA49F962D01", "parsely-tags": "Investing,IBD Stock Analysis,Paycom Software, cloud-based human capital management sofware, ObamaCare stocks to buy, Affordable Care Act regulations, complying with ACA, base-on-base, how to read stock charts, IBD Stock Analysis", "DC.Date.Issued": "2015-06-19T21:45Z", "parsely-title": "ObamaCare Compliance Rules Pay Off For Paycom", "fb": {"app_id": 154916351273272}, "parsely-author": "MATTHEW GALGANI", "parsely-section": "Investing", "keywords": "Investing,IBD Stock Analysis,Paycom Software, cloud-based human capital management sofware, ObamaCare stocks to buy, Affordable Care Act regulations, complying with ACA, base-on-base, how to read stock charts, IBD Stock Analysis", "parsely-type": "post", "verify-v1": "YZjCz9+d+L0R9oGgzk/twD8L81SyMR5wmSy+wBH+mK8=", "parsely-pub-date": "2015-06-19T21:45Z", "y_key": "936909c3c1994b0d", "parsely-image-url": "http://services.investors.com/image/ISA_150622.png.cms", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "parsely-link": "http://education.investors.com/ibd-stock-analysis/061915-758155-paycom-nears-buy-point.aspx"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8c37\"", "article_summary": "ObamaCare Compliance Rules Paying Off For Paycom ObamaCare Compliance Rules Paying Off For Paycom Already a leader in cloud-based human capital management software, Paycom is seeing new opportunities as companies struggle to comply with Affordable Care Act regulations.\nThat means more business for 2014 IPO stock Paycom Software (NYSE:PAYC), which provides cloud-based human capital management software covering everything from recruiting to retirement.\nA 24% return on equity and a 73% five-year average EPS growth rate help Paycom earn IBD's highest possible Composite Rating, 99.\nAs the stock nears a new buy point, Paycom hopes its Enhanced ACA product will help keep its trend of triple-digit earnings growth going.\nThe Oklahoma City-based firm now also offers Enhanced ACA, a product to help companies comply with ObamaCare regulations."}
