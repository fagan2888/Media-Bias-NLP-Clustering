A Colorado legislative committee on Monday killed a pair of bills aimed at barring religious discrimination, which opponents said would have created state-sanctioned discrimination against gays.

One bill would have barred the state from doing anything to “burden” anyone’s exercise of religion. The second would have shielded people who refused to engage in art or speech they disagree with.

“We’ve had a lot of discussion here today about where do we draw the line between the First Amendment — freedom of speech, freedom of religion — and discrimination,” said Rep. Gordon Klingenschmitt, R-Colorado Springs, who sponsored the latter bill, which failed by a 9-2 vote.

“I say we should draw the line between government-compelled speech.”

Klingenschmitt’s bill was motivated by civil rights complaints against two metro Denver bakers — one who refused to make a wedding cake for a gay couple, and another who refused to decorate a cake that she thought demeaned gays.

Dave Montez, executive director of the gay rights advocacy group One Colorado, said the bill created a loophole for discrimination “based on who they are, not what they buy.” Laws don’t tell bakers or other businesses what products to sell, but that they must treat all customers equally, he said.

Before his bill blocking government interference in religious practices failed 7-4, Rep. Patrick Neville, R-Castle Rock, told the committee he agreed that discrimination is unjustifiable.

“It’s incredibly unfortunate that we’ve had discrimination in this country all the way back to the Jim Crow laws,” he said. “The worst kind of discrimination, though, is when the government is the discriminator.”
