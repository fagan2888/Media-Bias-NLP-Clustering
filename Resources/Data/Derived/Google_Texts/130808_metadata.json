(But contribute to Scott Brown immediately, and please don\u2019t vote for the third-party, tea party candidate in Louisiana, right-wingers! Remember: Obamacare cannot be repealed without 66 votes in the Senate.)\n\nI\u2019ve barely been paying attention to the news, except to check Senate polls every night, because, as some of you may have noticed, I\u2019ve been in the bat-cave under Swiss Guard protection, writing my next book. But based on only about an hour of media consumption a week, I\u2019ve recently noticed mainstream \u201cnews\u201d outlets telling huge whoppers, long ago disproved and forgotten.\n\nFirst, this past Sunday, New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof repeated the canard about guns being dangerous to their owners. A \u201d a study in the journal Injury Prevention ,\u201d he wrote, \u201cfound that the purchase of a handgun was associated with 2.4 times the risk of being murdered and 6.8 times the risk of suicide.\u201d [Stranger Danger And Guns, September 27, 2014]\n\nNo kidding. As a lifelong subscriber to Injury Prevention, I could have told Kristof that people who live in crime-ridden neighborhoods or who have friends or professions that increase their likelihood of being killed\u2014or who plan to commit suicide\u2014are astronomically more likely to buy handguns than people whose lifestyles do not put them at such risks.\n\nMy own study, soon to be published in Injury Prevention\u2014and which I expect will similarly amaze Nick Kristof!\u2014establishes that people in hospitals are twice as likely to die within five years as people not in hospitals. To paraphrase Kristof: People think hospitals can save their lives. Nonsense!\n\nAnd don\u2019t even get me started on my study on people in ambulances.\n\nSecond, once the MSM figured out how to blame a white guy for a black athlete punching his fianc\u00e9e, and the only news was about Ray Rice and\u2014the true villain\u2014NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell, MSNBC\u2019s Toure repeated the old chestnut about emergency room admissions for domestic violence spiking on Super Bowl Sundays.\n\nAs I have noted at least a half-dozen times, this was a nonsense statistic invented by feminists and then cited as fact by a slew of major news outlets, culminating in a public service announcement during the 1993 Super Bowl that reminded viewers: \u201cDomestic violence is a crime!\u201d Finally, Washington Post reporter Ken Ringle, realizing that he was, in fact, a reporter, asked, Where\u2019d you get that figure?\n\nHe called all the experts who had been cited as sources for the statistic. All of them told him it wasn\u2019t true.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not what we found at all,\u201d said Janet Katz, professor of sociology and criminal justice and an author of one oft-cited study allegedly establishing the Super Bowl-wife-beating nexus. She said football games bore no relationship to emergency room admissions for domestic violence.\n\nA week after Toure recycled this hoax from the \u201990s, MSNBC\u2019s Mika Brzezinski said on \u201cMorning Joe\u201d: \u201cSuper Bowl Sunday has the highest rate of domestic violence.\u201d\n\nSo at least they correct their mistakes quickly over there.\n\nFinally, The Washington Post\u2019s Carol Leonnig is doggedly pushing the hoax about Obama getting more threats than any previous president. (They don\u2019t make \u2019em like Ken Ringle anymore.)\n\nEven after being corrected by an MSNBC host, Frances Rivera, last Sunday, Leonnig plowed ahead with her thoroughly disproved thesis, based on what someone had told her\u2014it was at either a DNC fundraiser or a Volvo dealership. And yes, Leonnig really was corrected by an MSNBC host for pushing an America-is-racist fabrication, which is like having Joseph Goebbels say to you, \u201cHey, lighten up on the Jews, would you?\u201d\n\nLeonnig\u2019s source may be New York Times archives. Or it could be the archives from any mainstream media outlet in America, where the \u201cmore threats\u201d rumor originated and was pumped out a mile a minute to an unsuspecting public for two solid years following Obama\u2019s announcement that he was running for president.\n\nBut then, in 2009, the head of the Secret Service finally told a congressional panel that it was complete bunk.\n\nIn the middle of being browbeaten by Rep. Eleanor Holmes Norton about the huge, unprecedented danger facing President Obama, then-Secret Service Director Mark Sullivan dropped the service\u2019s usual practice of refusing to comment on threats against the president to say, under oath: \u201cThe threats right now, and the inappropriate interest that we are seeing, is the same level as it has been for the previous two presidents.\u201d\n\nLeonnig even recycled the old folk tale about Obama\u2019s receiving Secret Service protection \u201cmuch earlier than other candidates.\u201d\n\nHow many times do we have to disprove this gibberish? The reason Obama\u2019s Secret Service protection started earlier than usual is that campaigns start earlier than usual. Obama declared he was running for president on Feb. 10, 2007. Three months later, he got Secret Service protection.\n\nReagan announced he was running for president on Nov. 13, 1979. You know when he got Secret Service protection? That same day. And you want to know why? For the exact same reason as Obama: He was a major-party candidate and he asked for it.\n\nMost hilariously, Leonnig actually broke down the (non-existent) excessive threats to Obama, telling MSNBC viewers that the increased threats used to come from Americans angry because Obama is black, but now they\u2019re mostly from people angry about Obamacare.\n\n(I wonder if the non-existent disproportionate threats go up on Super Bowl Sunday!)\n\nIn fact, the historical record shows that, apart from the occasional random nut, the people most likely to assassinate a president are leftists, socialists, communists, Palestinian activists, crazed environmentalists and communitarians, who have been responsible for every politically motivated presidential assassination attempt since at least 1900. (See \u201cMugged,\u201d Chapter 14.)\n\nReagan took an assassin\u2019s bullet to the chest within two months of becoming president. Jerry Ford was shot at twice within 13 months of assuming the presidency. But we still have to hear about angry right-wingers terrorizing President Obama.\n\nThe theme of all these liberal fantasies is that the greatest threat to women, minorities and liberals is right-wing white men with guns\u2014especially on a Super Bowl Sunday. (Referees are beheaded at soccer games in Brazil, but liberals are terrified of America\u2019s national sport.)\n\nWhite men are even threats to themselves, should they be foolish enough to purchase a gun.\n\nReagan\u2019s and Ford\u2019s attempted assassins, by the way, consisted of two liberal women and a deranged white man\u2014who was acquitted by a black jury. Despite Kristof\u2019s warning about guns, all three of them are still alive. And out of prison.\n\nOh\u2014and the two nuts who recently breached Obama\u2019s White House security? They\u2019re named Ortega and Gonzales.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.vdare.com/articles/ann-coulter-the-theme-of-all-these-liberal-fantasies-is-that-the-greatest-threat-is-right-wing-white-men?page=no-campaign"}, "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "The theme of all these liberal fantasies is that the greatest threat to women, minorities and liberals is right-wing white men with guns\u2014especially on a Super Bowl Sunday.\nThe reason Obama\u2019s Secret Service protection started earlier than usual is that campaigns start earlier than usual.\nBut then, in 2009, the head of the Secret Service finally told a congressional panel that it was complete bunk.\nBut we still have to hear about angry right-wingers terrorizing President Obama.\nYou know when he got Secret Service protection?"}
