(AP) - No one should call 911 for a non-emergency such as a skin rash or just because they\u2019re feeling tired.\n\nBut people do.\n\nLancaster County\u2019s emergency dispatchers have fielded calls from people who say they need help making a sandwich. They\u2019ve gotten 911 calls from people who complain their kids won\u2019t get up for school. And they\u2019ve gotten calls from people who are too hot in their homes and want someone to turn down their heat.\n\nThe volume of such frivolous calls, in fact, has spiked dramatically over the past year. And the increase worries emergency responders in Lancaster County, who say those kinds of calls cost them money and divert valuable resources away from real emergencies.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been about the last 10 months where we\u2019ve really seen the increase,\u201d said Mike Weaver, director of the county\u2019s 911 communication system.\n\nEstimates from the four largest ambulance companies in the county put the increase in what are termed \u201cpublic service\u201d calls to anywhere from 30 to 100 percent, depending on the area.\n\nNO SOLUTIONS\n\nWeaver is part of an eight-county regional emergency group that has been meeting about the problem in the last couple weeks to try and come up with solutions.\n\nBut so far there haven\u2019t been any.\n\n\u201cWe are the true equal opportunity provider, we don\u2019t discriminate for any reason. If someone calls for help whatever that may be, we don\u2019t let any call go unanswered,\u201d said Weaver.\n\n\u201cBut the problem is that there are folks basically grocery shopping and tired out and have trouble getting out of the car and they call 911. That is not a medical problem. That call is taking a unit out of service. Two minutes later we may get an emergency,\u201d Weaver said.\n\nBob May, executive director of the Lancaster Emergency Medical Services ambulance organization, the largest such organization in the county, said his crews were dispatched to a woman\u2019s home 20 times in one year because her couch cushions were so soft she had trouble getting up out of them.\n\nThey finally put a sign on her sofa that said, \u201cDon\u2019t sit here, sit in a chair.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve tolerated this for years, but it has to stop,\u201d May said. \u201cWe\u2019re so busy now and there have been times when these \u2018so-called\u2019 public service calls have delayed the response to an actual emergency.\u201d\n\nMay and Weaver are adamant that people with real emergencies or medical conditions should not hesitate to call 911 for assistance and or transport to a hospital.\n\nMay said some 911 callers only say they need assistance and an ambulance. They don\u2019t give any details.\n\n\u201cWhen they get there, the EMTs find out it is not a medical emergency,\u201d May said. \u201cSomeone just needs assistance.\u201d\n\n911: THE NEW FAMILY PHYSICIAN?\n\nSuzette Kreider, clinical operations manager at Northwest EMS, said some people use the 911 system and hospital emergency room in lieu of being seen by a family physician.\n\n\u201cPeople think they can be seen quicker in the emergency room if they come in by ambulance, but going in by ambulance is not quicker,\u201d she said. \u201cPatients are still triaged depending on their level of emergency. People call an ambulance for things they could be seen for in a doctor\u2019s office.\u201d\n\nKreider said ambulance companies receive no reimbursement when they respond to a residence for a non-emergency such as to help someone get up.\n\nEven ambulance crews transport a patient to the hospital, most private and public health insurance plans do not reimburse the agencies for a non-medical situation, according to several emergency representatives.\n\nAmbulance organizations lose tens of thousands of dollars each year.\n\nAn ambulance transport can cost anywhere from $300 to $900 per trip, depending on the level of medical care needed. For public service calls, most organizations get nothing.\n\nA GROWING PROBLEM\n\nAt Susquehanna EMS, chief Michael Fitzgibbons said the volume of public service calls doubled in 2014 to 110. They represent only a small fraction of the 8,000 total calls from Mount Joy, East and West Hempfield townships and the surrounding area. But they are still taxing on the agency.\n\n\u201cPeople should use the 911 system wisely,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re not a taxi.\u201d\n\nFitzgibbons said some people have called to be taken to the hospital and, once there, immediately check out because they really just needed a ride.\n\nHe said his service often gets calls to nursing or retirement homes for someone who has fallen.\n\n\u201cWhen we ask why someone who works there wouldn\u2019t pick this person off the floor, we\u2019re told that staff is not allowed to lift patients because they might hurt their back,\u201d Fitzgibbons said.\n\nWeaver said he thinks the problem is growing because of changes in modern society.\n\n\u201cIn the old days, people living in a neighborhood kept a watch on their neighbors and helped take care of them,\u201d he said. \u201cNow we have all this social media but we don\u2019t have as much of a social network.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve gotten calls when people are lonely and want somebody to talk to, so we switch them to a non-emergency line and talk to them for a few minutes,\u201d Weaver said.\n\n___\n\nOnline: http://bit.ly/1IgnTdE\n\n___\n\nInformation from: LNP, http://lancasteronline.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "No one should call 911 for a non-emergency such as a skin rash or just because they're feeling tired.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jul/21/pennsylvania-county-dealing-with-rash-of-frivolous/", "site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "type": "article", "description": "No one should call 911 for a non-emergency such as a skin rash or just because they\u2019re feeling tired.", "title": "Pennsylvania county dealing with rash of frivolous 911 calls"}, "twitter": {"description": "No one should call 911 for a non-emergency such as a skin rash or just because they're feeling tired.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Pennsylvania county dealing with rash of frivolous 911 calls"}, "Author": "SUSAN BALDRIGE", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb724\"", "article_summary": "A GROWING PROBLEMAt Susquehanna EMS, chief Michael Fitzgibbons said the volume of public service calls doubled in 2014 to 110.\nThey\u2019ve gotten 911 calls from people who complain their kids won\u2019t get up for school.\nFor public service calls, most organizations get nothing.\nEstimates from the four largest ambulance companies in the county put the increase in what are termed \u201cpublic service\u201d calls to anywhere from 30 to 100 percent, depending on the area.\n\u201cWhen they get there, the EMTs find out it is not a medical emergency,\u201d May said."}
