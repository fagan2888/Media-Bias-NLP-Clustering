According to the report, total student enrollment has been growing slowly but steadily since the 2006-2007 school year. But without the growth among Hispanics, total enrollment actually would have been declining since the late 1990s.\n\nWithin the next five years, Carter estimates that Hispanics will make up 22 percent of the total student body in Kansas \u2014 up from less than 5 percent in the early 1990s. Whites by that time will make up just 60 percent of the student body, compared with 85 percent in the 1992-1993 school year. The proportion of black students is projected to hold steady at about 7 percent.\n\nThose trends are likely to have a profound impact on everything from state budgets and school taxes to the nature of Kansas businesses and the economy.\n\nEducation costs\n\nThe most obvious consequence, experts say, will be increased costs for public school funding. Although the report looks only at \u201cheadcount\u201d enrollment, school funding in Kansas is based on \u201cweighted\u201d enrollment that counts some students more than once, depending on factors such as poverty status and English language proficiency.\n\nMark Tallman, a lobbyist for KASB, wrote in a blog after the report's release that when weighting factors are added in, the additional 25,000 students equates to roughly 35,000 additional \u201cweighted\u201d students for funding purposes, resulting in an additional $135 million in school finance costs\n\n\u201cThis would be the cost of simply keeping the base state aid per pupil at the same level, with no adjustment for inflation or expanded programs,\u201d Tallman wrote.\n\nBut the impact could also extend far beyond the mere cost of funding public schools.\n\nThe future of Kansas\n\nEmily Rauscher, an assistant professor of sociology at Kansas University who studies demographics and education, says the rapid growth in the Hispanic student population has broader meaning for the state as a whole because the student population reflects what the adult population will soon look like.\n\nBecause many Hispanics tend to have lower incomes, Rauscher said, growth in that population could affect the state's overall poverty rate, resulting in higher costs for some social services.\n\nBut she also said it could have long-term positive impacts because the higher birth rate among Hispanics could help reverse the state's long-term trend of losing its young population.\n\n\u201cKansas and other states or areas of the heartland tend to lose a lot of their young people, contributing to an overall brain drain,\u201d she said. \u201cTo have more young people will help boost the economy and innovation. Demographers talk about this a lot, the issues of an aging population. Getting some of the youth back would be good.\u201d\n\nIn addition, she said, having more people in the state who are fluent in multiple languages could also benefit the state's business economy.\n\n\u201cHigher rates of bilingualism can't hurt,\u201d she said. \u201cLinguistic studies suggest that bilingualism helps people have different views of the world. It creates more connections in their brain.\u201d\n\nCopyright 2016 The Lawrence Journal-World. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed.
