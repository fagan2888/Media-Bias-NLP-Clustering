A continuing budget crunch has not kept Northern Arizona University from managing to open two new facilities in the span of a month.

The Arizona Daily Sun reports that the Flagstaff school has been leaning on other sources to keep several big-budget projects alive.

NAU recently unveiled its new Student and Academic Services building and the Aquatics and Tennis Complex.

University spokeswoman Cindy Brown says both got Arizona Board of Regents approval before a $17 million budget cut was enacted by Gov. Doug Ducey last year.

Brown says the $47.5 million athletic complex was covered by system revenue bonds and existing student fees.

University officials, however, say the need for more academic spaces on campus will only rise as the funding from tuition dollars shrinks.
