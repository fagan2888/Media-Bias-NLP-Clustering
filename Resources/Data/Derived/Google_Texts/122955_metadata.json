What you may not know is there are exceptions, and if you are denied access, you can challenge that.\n\nDonna Kubat of Allen Township is doing it now.\n\nShe was switching physicians and asked Allen Ear, Nose and Throat Association in South Whitehall Township to send her records to her new doctor.\n\nKubat told me the practice forwarded treatment notes but withheld other records. It told her in a letter in August that \"as a patient safety measure,\" the practice doesn't release \"allergy testing or allergy serum records to other practices/providers for treatment purposes.\"\n\nKubat doesn't see how that's permissible and is fighting for access. She told me and the practice she wants the records for comparative purposes and her own knowledge.\n\n\"I have the right to know what they were injecting into my body every week,\" she said.\n\nThe practice believes otherwise and says it has the law on its side.\n\nAllen Ear, Nose and Throat cited the state physicians' Code of Conduct, which says a \"practitioner may withhold information from a patient if, in the reasonable exercise of his professional judgment, he believes release of the information would adversely affect the patient's health.\"\n\n\"We release all of our records as per the law except for the allergy testing records,\" the practice's office administrator, Anita Davis, told me.\n\nShe said patients are notified in writing about the policy. She wouldn't discuss Kubat's situation due to HIPAA, which is short for Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act.\n\nAllen Ear, Nose and Throat withholds records about serums and testing protocols, Davis said, because they are unique. Other providers would not be able to replicate them and harm could result if they tried. She noted that physicians should not treat patients based on records from another provider.\n\nThe policy was enacted in 2007 after a former patient took his testing records to another allergist when he moved, she said. The patient suffered anaphylaxis (a severe reaction) from an allergy treatment, and his new allergist blamed Allen Ear, Nose and Throat for providing incorrect information, she said.\n\n\"We genuinely believe that our policy is based on sound, ethical information,\" Davis said.\n\nKubat disagrees. She filed a complaint last week with the Pennsylvania State Board of Medicine, which enforces the state's Code of Conduct, and intends to file one with the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services, which enforces HIPAA.\n\nDavis told me Allen Ear, Nose and Throat has prevailed in previous challenges, two filed with the feds and one with the state.\n\n\"We've been challenged and we've never been advised that we are acting inappropriately,\" she said.\n\nIn its letter to Kubat, Allen Ear, Nose and Throat said it used specific reagents and extracts in her treatment, substances that are unique to the practice and can't be replicated.\n\n\"Even the slightest variation can pose a threat for reaction if your body interprets the variation as foreign,\" the letter said. \"Since other practices may use different reagents and extracts from different vendors or even the same vendor, it is about your body's interpretation and this cannot be predicted or managed without the proper controls in place.\"\n\nThe state law cited by the practice is worded slightly different from HIPAA, which says professionals may refuse to release records if \"the access requested is reasonably likely to endanger the life or physical safety of the individual or another person.\"\n\nThe state law says records can be withheld if their release \"would adversely affect the patient's health.\"\n\nStates can regulate patients' access to their medical records, but HIPAA would preempt any state law that is less protective, said Deven McGraw, deputy director for health information privacy at the Office for Civil Rights at the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services.\n\nWhether a practice's application of Pennsylvania's law is contrary to HIPAA is something that would be part of an investigation if a complaint is filed, McGraw said.\n\nIn addition to complaining to state and federal authorities, patients in situations such as Kubat's can file an appeal with the practice, too, she said.\n\nHIPAA requires practices to designate a licensed health care professional who didn't participate in the original decision to review any appeals.\n\nThe inability to access records is among the top HIPAA complaints, McGraw told me. The agency intends to issue new guidance about the law soon, so the public understands its rights and health care professionals understand their obligations.\n\nViolators can be penalized. In 2011, the Department of Health & Human Services fined Cignet Health of Maryland $4.3 million for violating patients' rights by denying them access to their medical records and refusing to cooperate with investigators.\n\nHIPAA puts some medical records off-limits in all circumstances, including psychotherapy notes taken by a mental health professional and inmate records if their release would jeopardize the health, safety or security of the inmate, other inmates or prison staff.\n\nWhen you do get records, you may have to pay for copying and mailing. You are entitled to copies only, not originals. If records are digital, you are entitled to them in that format. A provider may not withhold records because you haven't paid for the provided care.\n\nIf you get your records and find inaccuracies, you have the right to ask a health care provider or insurer to amend them. If refused, you have the right to submit a \"statement of disagreement\" that must be added to your file.\n\nThe Watchdog is published Thursdays and Sundays.
