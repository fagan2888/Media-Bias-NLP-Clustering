If she ever allowed the press to question her we might find out.\n\nTake her stance on Obamacare. As we\u2019ve all learned, through the maze of regulations and the individual mandate, we\u2019re all required to have a minimum package of benefits and have lost the right to buy catastrophic plans (or be taxed). Insurance companies have been pulling out of the exchanges and suffering losses, thereby raising the prospect of the government (the taxpayers) making them whole. With all that background and with her enthusiastic embrace of Obamacare, we note this report:\n\nAsked about the idea of insurance companies competing across state lines, Clinton said, \u201cI think it\u2019s something we should look at.\u201d \u201cIf we\u2019re going to have a free market system, we need a free market where we\u2019ve got people competing on cost and quality, and that may be one thing we need to look at,\u201d she said.\n\nThunk. For starters Obamacare eliminated a free market by mandating benefits. One result has been to chase insurers from the exchanges as well as throw more Americans into the closest we have to socialized medicine, Medicaid. If she\u2019s pro-free market she never should have supported Obamacare, which is a huge distortion of free markets. But it gets worse. The idea of selling insurance across state lines was championed back in 2007-2008 . . . by Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.). His then-economic adviser Doug Holtz-Eakin tells me, \u201cIt is incoherent that candidate Clinton is picking up a McCain proposal from 2008 in hopes of injecting some competition into the hopelessly over-regulated, top-down Obamacare system she help to build.\u201d Does she understand her inconsistency? We don\u2019t know because no voter is going to grill her on her contradictions and leaps of logic.\n\nThen take small business. In Iowa she declared, \u201cSlowly over time it\u2019s become more difficult \u2014 more expensive, more red tape, unnecessary regulations that have really put a damper\u201d on business. Thunk again. Between Obamacare, between the slew of Environmental Protection Agency regulations and Dodd-Frank this administration has contributed arguably more to this situation than any in recent memory. Did she oppose any of them? Which does she want to repeal? What\u2019s more, during her trip she bemoaned the lack of mandatory paid sick and maternity leave. Umm, isn\u2019t that more expense we\u2019d be dumping on business?\n\nTo be certain, many politicians are not particularly consistent. But in Hillary Clinton\u2019s case one wonders if the lack of media access and the bubble within Hillaryland that she occupies have diminished her ability to think critically about her ideas. She is so used to blathering and saying very little that she may be unaccustomed to the rigors of real debate. It\u2019s one more burden Democrats take on by clearing the field for her stroll to the nomination.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Is Hillary confused or being disingenuous?", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Is Hillary confused or being disingenuous?", "title": "Hillary\u2019s cognitive dissonance", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2015/04/16/hillarys-cognitive-dissonance/", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2015/04/14/Production/Daily/Editorial-Opinion/Images/Was8917768.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@JRubinBlogger"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2015/04/16/hillarys-cognitive-dissonance/", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "clinton obamacare, clinton inconsistent, clinton small business", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "clinton obamacare, clinton inconsistent, clinton small business"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdca3b\"", "article_summary": "Hillary Clinton announced her candidacy for the presidency on April 12 and is expected to be the front-runner for the Democratic Party nomination.\nHillary Clinton participates in a roundtable discussion with students and educators during an April 14 campaign event at Kirkwood Community College in Monticello, Iowa.\n(MICHAEL B.
