A lot of people worked really hard out there in the nation to make that happen. I was one of them. And I think people worked hard because they expected a change based on that majority.\u201d\n\n\u201cI do think that people want to know, \u2018What do we stand for? What does our party stand for? What do I stand for?'\u201d she added.\n\nFollow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor", "article_metadata": {"description": "Fiorina Pushes Gov't Shutdown to Defund Planned Parenthood: 'What Do We Stand For?'", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Fiorina Pushes Gov't Shutdown to Defund Planned Parenthood: 'What Do We Stand For?'", "title": "Fiorina Pushes Gov't Shutdown to Defund Planned Parenthood: 'What Do We Stand For?' - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 532, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/09/Fiorina920.jpg", "height": 399}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/video/2015/09/20/fiorina-pushes-govt-shutdown-to-defund-planned-parenthood-what-do-we-stand-for/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Fiorina Pushes Gov't Shutdown to Defund Planned Parenthood: 'What Do We Stand For?'", "creator": "@jeff_poor", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/09/Fiorina920.jpg", "title": "Fiorina Pushes Gov't Shutdown to Defund Planned Parenthood: 'What Do We Stand For?' - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "app_id": 1243316582352556, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Carly Fiorina, Fox News Sunday, Planned Parenthood,2016 Presidential Race, Abortion, Breitbart TV,Fiorina", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "2016 Presidential Race", "tag": "Planned Parenthood", "published_time": "2015-09-20T09:49:01-07:00", "categories": "Breitbart TV,2016 Presidential Race,Abortion"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2000\"", "article_summary": "\u201cWhat\u2019s changed is the Republican Party has historic majorities in the House and we now control the majority in the Senate.\nWhat does our party stand for?\nFiorina went on to argue that the circumstances are different now than they were to prior government shutdown and not taking a stand on this calls into question the values of the Republican Party.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERShe pointed out congressional Democrats resist federal funding for women\u2019s health centers that do not provide federal funding.\nAnd I think people worked hard because they expected a change based on that majority.\u201d\u201cI do think that people want to know, \u2018What do we stand for?"}
