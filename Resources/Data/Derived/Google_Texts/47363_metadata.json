Roy was at times on his knees, showing Berra the basics of the butterfly and glove position.\n\nBerra flopped again, albeit with an inadvertent redirection \u201cown\u201d goal by Avs defenseman Nick Holden and another change-up tally by Coyotes center Antoine Vermette. The third goal allowed was soft, and Berra was pulled for 22-year-old rookie Calvin Pickard for the second straight game with Colorado in deep trouble, this time trailing 3-0.\n\nThis has become a point-producing formula for the Avs, who rallied in front of Pickard behind young standouts Gabe Landeskog (two goals) and Matt Duchene (goal) and a lucky overtime bounce off the stick of Daniel Briere in winning 4-3 in overtime and collecting points for the fourth time in their past five games.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a tough stretch right now for Reto, and unfortunately for him,\u201d Roy said. \u201cGood for us that Calvin is playing well.\u201d\n\nBriere\u2019s centering pass with 1:44 remaining in OT caromed in off Coyotes forward Martin Hanzal. Briere said the bad bounces the Avs had in the first period evened out at the end.\n\nSaid Roy: \u201cAll we wanted was to win the second period and see where we were, and I thought the guys competed hard in the third. We put pucks on net, battled hard in front of their net and found ways to score goals.\u201d\n\nRoy singled out Landeskog. \u201cHe\u2019s such a warrior, really battled hard,\u201d Roy said of the captain.\n\nPickard got the win in the Avs\u2019 previous game, a 4-3 triumph over Carolina on Saturday after the Hurricanes chased Berra and led 3-1. He was again stellar against Arizona and figures to be the new No. 1 goalie until Semyon Varlamov returns from a groin injury.\n\n\u201cIt was pretty much a replica of last game. We got down early and once I got in our team pretty much took over the game,\u201d said Pickard, who had his father, Dan, and former billet family from juniors in attendance. \u201cBeing down 3-0 on the road is not easy, but they kept with it, had a ton of chances, and it was nice to win that in overtime.\u201d\n\nHolden entered Tuesday at minus-14, among the league\u2019s worst, and his troubles continued. Midway through the game he had Berra behind him, but nevertheless tried to make a glove save on Michael Stone\u2019s shot from the point. Holden\u2019s glove wasn\u2019t as big as what goalie Berra had, and the change in direction off Holden\u2019s mitt steered the Avs into a 2-0 deficit.\n\nTobias Rieder scored off a long snap shot to chase Berra before the Avs came alive. Landeskog roofed a backhander early in the second period and went five-hole on goalie Mike Smith early in the third before Duchene tied it with a fortunate bounce off the stick of a Coyotes defenseman.\n\nThe Avs departed for Denver immediately after the game and will play the Chicago Blackhawks on Wednesday night at the Pepsi Center. The Blackhawks will be fresh.\n\nColorado\u2019s charter out of Denver International Airport on Monday was leaving for Phoenix as the Blackhawks\u2019 plane was arriving.\n\nMike Chambers: mchambers@denverpost.com or twitter.com/mikechambers\n\nCHICAGO AT COLORADO\n\n\n\n7 p.m. Wednesday, ALT; 950 AM\n\nSpotlight on Kris Versteeg: The Blackhawks reacquired Versteeg \u2014 who helped them win the Stanley Cup in 2010 \u2014 a year ago for two bright, young prospects, and he is again one of the most underrated players on a star-studded team.
