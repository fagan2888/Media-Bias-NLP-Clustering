You can even print it on a baseball cap,\u201d Cruz told a crowd at the DoubleTree hotel in downtown Little Rock.\n\nThe Republican Texas senator and presidential canidate said it is principles, not slogans, that can make America great again. He said that if he is elected, he will repeal the Affordable Care Act, abolish the IRS, grow the economy and keep America safe.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m convinced this election is going to come down to three things: jobs, freedom and security,\u201d he said.\n\nTrump also took on his other main rival for the Republican nomination, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, saying Rubio has supported amnesty for illegal immigrants.\n\nIn a question-and-answer session with reporters before he took the stage, Cruz said Arkansas is \u201ca critically important state\u201d in the presidential race.\n\nCruz said Democrat Hillary Clinton and billionaire Trump are close on many issues and said he presents a clear, conservative alternative.\n\nAsked why he chose to release only the first two pages of his tax returns from 2011-14, Cruz said he did it to match his opponents. He criticized Trump for not releasing any tax returns \u2014 Trump has said he is not releasing them now because he is being audited \u2014 and said it raises questions about what the returns would show.\n\nJoining Cruz in the rally was radio and television personality Glenn Beck, who likened Donald Trump to fascism. People are drawn to Trump, he said, because they feel powerless and want someone to come in and slap people around.\n\n\u201cThat leads to places like Mussolini,\u201d he said.\n\nBeck also told the crowd, \u201cHillary Clinton should not be running for president. She should be in prison.\u201d\n\nCruz has made two previous campaign swings through Arkansas. He made appearances in Little Rock, Russellville and Van Buren in August and in North Little Rock in December.\n\nArkansas elected officials who have endorsed Cruz include Secretary of State Mark Martin and at least 18 state legislators. Gov. Asa Hutchinson has endorsed Rubio.\n\nMike Brannen, an information technology manager from Sherwood who attended Saturday\u2019s rally, said he supports Cruz because he trusts him to restore conservative values to the country.\n\n\u201cHe learned the Constitution when he was 8 years old. He\u2019s been this way all of his life,\u201d Brannen said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "LITTLE ROCK \u2014 Ted Cruz mocked Donald Trump and his favorite slogan in a rally in Arkansas\u2019 capital city Saturday night.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "John Lyon Arkansas News Bureau jlyon@arkansasnews.com", "og": {"site_name": "Arkansas News", "description": "LITTLE ROCK \u2014 Ted Cruz mocked Donald Trump and his favorite slogan in a rally in Arkansas\u2019 capital city Saturday night.", "title": "Cruz stumps in Little Rock", "url": "http://arkansasnews.com/news/arkansas/cruz-stumps-little-rock", "image": "http://arkansasnews.com/sites/arkansasnews.com/files/field/media/web1_ted-cruz-rally_0.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://arkansasnews.com/news/arkansas/cruz-stumps-little-rock", "image": {"src": "http://arkansasnews.com/sites/arkansasnews.com/files/field/media/web1_ted-cruz-rally_0.jpg"}, "title": "Cruz stumps in Little Rock", "card": "summary", "creator": "@arkansasnews"}, "keywords": "Arkansas,News,", "article": {"published_time": "2016-02-27T21:20:26-06:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=0.9"}, "article_summary": "He made appearances in Little Rock, Russellville and Van Buren in August and in North Little Rock in December.\nYou can even print it on a baseball cap,\u201d Cruz told a crowd at the DoubleTree hotel in downtown Little Rock.\nLITTLE ROCK \u2014 Ted Cruz mocked Donald Trump and his favorite slogan in a rally in Arkansas\u2019 capital city Saturday night.\nArkansas elected officials who have endorsed Cruz include Secretary of State Mark Martin and at least 18 state legislators.\nIn a question-and-answer session with reporters before he took the stage, Cruz said Arkansas is \u201ca critically important state\u201d in the presidential race."}
