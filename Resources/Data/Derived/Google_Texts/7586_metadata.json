The company reported that it provided medical coverage for 23.7 million people by the end of the quarter, up from 22.7 million from the same period last year with the extra 1 million boosting the annual forecast. The total individual membership count is 1.3% accounting for 6% of the company's total 2015 projected revenues.\n\nAlthough Aetna's public-exchange membership, now over 950,000, is slightly lower than last year, it was enough to draw a positive response from analysts such as Peter Costa of Wells Fargo who said in research note, \u201cAetna\u2019s quarter displayed strong performance despite still significant headwinds from the Affordable Care Act.\u201d\n\nThe industry, however, has been skeptical about rising health-care costs, especially for drugs designed to treat hepatitis C. Aetna, the third largest US-based health insurer, said earlier that the company expects to benefit from a deal that will allow it to secure Gilead's hepatitis C drugs at a lower cost. It also stated that the medical cost for the company\u2019s commercial business was toward the lower half of projections.\n\nThe company's shares, which have risen 24.26% this year, went up another 3.24% in yesterday\u2019s trading session to close at $110.38. Stock price gains on the news are, however, far from over, given that the company's stock is currently trading at 13.7 times its projected 2016 earnings and continues to remain a lucrative investment opportunity. With the company expected to beat its earnings estimates, stock price will likely go up further. In fact, Ana Gupte, an analyst with Leerink Partners, is of the opinion that the company\u2019s earnings could go up to $7.50 per share. When applied to the industry average multiple of 17.5 times 2015 earnings, this would mean Aetna's stock price could go up 17%, changing hands at $129 apiece.\n\nMs. Gupte said: \u201cWhile the health insurance group has had a nice performance rally and some names have moved into the GARP (growth-at-a-reasonable-price) category, Aetna remains firmly in the value camp.\u201d\n\nThe company\u2019s share price, however, could take a turn in the wrong direction if medical costs start ticking upward, although they remain below the company\u2019s projections presently. The trend is similar to United Health, which too has seen costs stay firmly below expectations.\n\nAetna\u2019s share price can be impacted by a pending US Supreme Court ruling. The Court is due to announce its decision in June regarding the subsidies received by millions of Americans who purchased health insurance through ObamaCare since it was passed in 2010. The law, if struck down, would result in millions of US residents losing health insurance, depressing earnings for health insurance providers.", "article_metadata": {"DESCRIPTION": "Aetna stock was positively rewarded as investors cheered on the announcement of better-than-anticipated results for the 1QFY15.
