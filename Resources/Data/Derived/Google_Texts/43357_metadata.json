One of their urgent requests is to have us supply them with weapons,\u201d McCain said, according to the Kyiv Post . \u201cI will be urging our administration to arrange that transfer as quickly as possible.\"\n\nDurbin agreed, saying the nation\u2019s small army had been \u201chollowed out\u201d by the ousted president, Viktor Yanukovych.\n\n\u201cTime and again, they asked us for military help. They need it. I think they should have it. They have to have the wherewithal to defend themselves,\u201d he said.\n\nDurbin and McCain are two of eight senators who have traveled to Ukraine to visit the nation following its political upheaval.
