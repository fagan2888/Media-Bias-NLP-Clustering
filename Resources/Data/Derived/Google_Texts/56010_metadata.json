It also noted that the Israel Movement for Reform and Progressive Judaism and the Coalition Against Racism have asked the government to investigate.\n\nGopstein has a long history on the far-right of Israeli politics. In the past, he has publicly insisted that setting fire to Christian churches in Israel is justified.\n\nHis group Lehava, whose name is a Hebrew acronym for \u201cPreventing Assimilation in the Holy Land,\u201d has frequently been called \u201cfascist\u201d and \u201cradical right-wing.\u201d\n\nLehava is infamous for violently harassing and threatening Israeli Arabs who are in relationships with Israeli Jews. In the name of fighting \u201charassment,\u201d the far-right group created racist beach patrols in order to prevent Jewish women from interacting with Arab men.\n\nIts members have also set fire to and vandalized the few remaining bilingual Hebrew-Arabic schools in Israel, and yet are often not charged with hate crimes.\n\nThe group has additionally organized boycotts of businesses that employ Palestinians, and has protested against Jews who rent housing in Israel to Palestinians.\n\nHolocaust survivors have warned that Lehava reminds them of the horrors of fascism they experienced.\n\nMany of the group\u2019s members, including Gopstein, are followers of Meir Kahane, an Israeli-American fascist leader who founded the extremist Jewish Defense League, which is considered a \u201cright-wing terrorist group\u201d by the U.S. government and a \u201cradical organization that preaches a violent form of anti-Arab, Jewish nationalism\u201d by leading hate group monitor the Southern Poverty Law Center.\n\nIsaac Herzog, leader of Israel\u2019s centrist opposition party the Zionist Union, has called Lehava a \u201cJewish terrorist organization.\u201d\n\nPosts on Gopstein\u2019s Facebook page include pictures of some of the few Arab lawmakers there are in Israel that were photoshopped to look like they are being hanged.\n\nFar-right Israeli-American extremist Baruch Goldstein massacred 29 Muslim civilians and injured 125 more at the religious site the Cave of the Patriarchs in Israel in 1994. Lehava and other radical right-wing Israeli organizations consider Goldstein \u2014 who, like them, was a follower of Kahane \u2014 a hero. At a 2010 ceremony honoring the mass murderer, whom the Israeli government considers a terrorist, the Lehava leader said Goldstein \u201cavenged the enemies of the Jews.
