USA – -(Ammoland.com)- Shooting USA – The Back Up Gun Nationals

It’s the match for the gun you actually carry, the first Backup Gun Nationals inside Smith & Wesson’s ranges in Springfield, Mass. The snub nosed revolvers and pocket pistols are shooting head-to-head in competition that simulates CCW in the real world. Plus, the story of the moon clip, created for the M1917 Colt. Then John shows you how to improve your AR Trigger in a Brownells Home Gunsmithing Project. And Todd Jarrett shows you how to shoot your AR in unusual positions.

Shooting USA’s Impossible Shots – The Classic 600 Yards of Bob

There’s an old Montana legend about a cowboy shooting a deer at 600 yards with a handgun. Bob Munden looks to prove him right in a Classic Shot, 600 yards with a Smith & Wesson .44 Magnum on a steel target. And Mr. Flintlock is working on his favorite exhibition shot, cutting cards. The question is, how many can he cut with a single shot? Plus Smith & Wesson Pro Jerry Miculek creates the ultimate 3-Gun challenge, Rifle, Pistol, and Shotgun at incredible speeds.
