I mean show what we would do, what our ideal policy would be\u2014looking forward to 2017 and beyond.\"\n\nRyan\u2013who has long carried the reputation in the House as the party's ideas man\u2013 suggested Thursday that Republicans need to stop simply rolling back Obama's proposals and come up with creative ideas of their own.\n\nIn addition to healthcare, Ryan plans to simply the tax code next year and go after some of the government's most highly-guarded loopholes.\n\n\"Look, I know people like many of these loopholes, and they have their reasons. But there are so many of them that now the tax code is like a to-do list\u2014Washington\u2019s to-do list. But Washington has no business micromanaging people\u2019s lives\u2014pure and simple,\" Ryan is expected to say. \"I also know many of these loopholes will be fiercely defended. All I can say is we will not be cowed. We are not here to smooth things over. We are here to shake things up.\"\\\n\nHe also will tackle welfare reform, which he says needs major changes.\n\n\"Require everyone who can to work. Let states and communities try different ideas. And then test the results,\" Ryan is expected to say.\n\nRyan is asking his party to engage and take chances with bold proposals, but Ryan will also have to contend with the same warring factions in his party House Speaker John Boehner did. Getting the entire party on the same page proved to be the toughest part of Boehner's job.\n\nRyan had a message for his party on unity.\n\n\"Don\u2019t give them a win by default. Put together a positive agenda, and take it to the American people. Give people the choice they are yearning for. And if next year, this House can say we have done that, then we will have done our job,\" Ryan said.\"Then the people will know that we stand for a more prosperous, a more secure, a more confident America. And the rest? Well, the rest will be up to the people\u2014as it should be.\"", "article_metadata": {"p": {"domain_verify": "da088b457e7d0e91a9f692968f1043c1"}, "og": {"site_name": "Talking Points Memo", "description": "There may be a presidential election raging in 2016, but new House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) plans to keep Congress busy, and the first order of business will be replacing Obamacare.", "title": "Paul Ryan Plans To 'Replace Every Word of Obamacare'", "url": "http://talkingpointsmemo.com/dc/paul-ryan-will-replace-obamacare-next-year", "image": "http://a2.img.talkingpointsmemo.com/image/upload/c_fill,fl_keep_iptc,g_faces,h_365,w_652/utpzi9gg6ojcbsoqnmlu.jpg", "type": "article"}, "parsely-metadata": "{}", "csrf-param": "authenticity_token", "csrf-token": "Xx0PVySM4so9OcirMd8eq7ePKEZ1YD5O1/or1pYVYhU=", "fb": {"admins": 12330256, "pages": 98658495398}, "google-site-verification": "iivVZJBLxzSBdse8fFugr6fbJu-DbSB1dhl_fs48KNQ", "parsely-page": "{\"title\":\"Paul Ryan Plans To 'Replace Every Word of Obamacare'\",\"link\":\"http://talkingpointsmemo.com/dc/paul-ryan-will-replace-obamacare-next-year\",\"image_url\":\"http://img.talkingpointsmemo.com/image/upload/v1446391101/utpzi9gg6ojcbsoqnmlu.jpg\",\"type\":\"post\",\"section\":\"dc\",\"author\":\"Lauren Fox\",\"pub_date\":\"2015-12-03T17:46:00Z\",\"post_id\":\"article_243400\",\"tags\":[]}"}, "article_summary": "\"Next year, we are going to unveil a plan to replace every word of Obamacare,\" Ryan is expected to say in an address at the Library of Congress Thursday.\nThere may be a presidential election raging in 2016, but new House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) plans to keep Congress busy, and the first order of business will be replacing Obamacare.\nBut there are so many of them that now the tax code is like a to-do list\u2014Washington\u2019s to-do list.\nRyan is asking his party to engage and take chances with bold proposals, but Ryan will also have to contend with the same warring factions in his party House Speaker John Boehner did.\nBut Washington has no business micromanaging people\u2019s lives\u2014pure and simple,\" Ryan is expected to say."}
