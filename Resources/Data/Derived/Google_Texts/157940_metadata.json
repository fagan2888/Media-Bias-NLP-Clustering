Chief among those were increasing the spiritual and emotional role the Christian organization plays the lives of those it serves; establishing a Sunday church service; and raising more awareness in the community of the good things Hope Clinic accomplishes.\n\nAs it turned out, Hope\u2019s board of directors was already thinking along the same lines, said Hudson. They, too, saw a need for an increased emotional impact, plans were in place for a Sunday service; and they had put out the call for social workers and a financial development coordinator.\n\nHudson, a former educator and principal at Arbor Preparatory High School who almost didn\u2019t apply for the position, said God was at work in leading him to become the director at Hope.\n\n\u201cIt is a perfect match. We\u2019re starting to increase the number of social workers, we now have a church service at 5:30 p.m. every Sunday, we\u2019re conducting interviews for a financial development coordinator and putting the pieces in place and running with it,\u201d Hudson said. \u201cThere is a lot of transition but it\u2019s exciting.\u201d\n\nHope already provides a wide range of services. In 2012, Hope provided approximately 9,000 medical visits, 4,900 dental visits, 196,317 pounds worth of of food, filled $2.7 million worth of prescriptions, a free bag of groceries for 50 families weekly and served 9,200 hot meals.\n\n\n\nIts free laundry service is extremely popular and Hudson said the free day care takes a huge burden off working parents. Volunteers contributed 31,000 hours of their time to make the services possible.\n\nHudson\u2019s unlikely path to the Hope Clinic started with a cerebral stroke in December 2012. Prior to that, he had spent three years as a teacher, seven years as an assistant principal and two as a principal at Arbor Prep.\n\nHudson finished the year, but while he was on medical leave the assistant principal did a strong job filling in and Hudson felt that he just couldn\u2019t continue leading the school with his health challenges.\n\nIn June, he stepped down but, as he recovered, a friend began urging him to apply for the soon-to-be-vacant Hope position. The friend was persistent, though Hudson kept declining, not believing the position was for him. Finally the friend told Hudson that if Hudson would just read some literature on Hope, then there would never be a mention of the job again.\n\nHudson said he believes the lord was directing him to the position.\n\n\u201cI got the sense that I wasn\u2019t made to sit in a cubicle and work on Excel spreadsheets all day and the lord says I\u2019m supposed to lead,\u201d he said. \u201cI sent in my resume, said \u2018This is where I\u2019m supposed to be,\u2019 and the lord provided and it has been an amazing experience.\u201d\n\nIn February Hope launched its church service, and though there is a much greater emphasis on the spirituality and the clinic's Christian foundation, Hudson stressed the organization helps Christians and non-Christians.\n\nThe medical clinic is at capacity, but the clinic\u2019s basement offers room for expansion, Hudson said, and that space could potentially be utilized for the new social work volunteers the clinic is bringing aboard.\n\nAmong their charges will be connecting families to community resources such as Medicaid, food stamps or helping with affordable housing; helping families with baby care; helping to provide medication access through pharmaceutical companies; and providing nutrition education.\n\nHudson also underscored that while more poor residents are insured through Medicaid and the Affordable Health Care Act, Hope Clinic isn\u2019t turning anyone away who doesn\u2019t have insurance.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not looking to maintain our client base. We\u2019re very excited that more people are insured \u2026 the more people who get more services, the better,\u201d Hudson said. \u201cBut we are still packed and we want people to know that we are still accepting those who need services and are uninsured or under-insured.\u201d\n\nHope is also budgeting for the financial development coordinator, who Hudson said will help tell the world all the good things the clinic is up to.\n\n\u201cWe need to be screaming from the mountain tops and spreading the word through volunteers and word of mouth about we\u2019re doing,\u201d Hudson said. \u201cWe need to bring Hope to the forefront for the community to gain more understanding of what we do.\u201d\n\nTom Perkins is a freelance reporter for The Ann Arbor News.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "ypsilanti, ypsilanti-township, news", "title": "Under new leadership, Hope Clinic to take more spiritual approach to serving residents in need", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Under new leadership, Hope Clinic to take more spiritual approach to serving residents in need \", \"link\": \"http://www.mlive.com/news/ann-arbor/index.ssf/2014/04/under_new_leadership_hope_clin.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://image.mlive.com/home/mlive-media/width620/img/annarbornews_impact/photo/14679629-standard.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"12622635\", \"pub_date\": \"2014-04-12T09:25:24Z\", \"author\": \"Tom Perkins | Special to The Ann Arbor News\", \"tags\": [\"@aa-river\",\"ypsilanti\",\"ypsilanti-township\"] }", "twitter": {"image": "http://image.mlive.com/home/mlive-media/width620/img/annarbornews_impact/photo/14679629-standard.jpg", "description": "When recently-hired Hope Clinic Director Matt Hudson was in the interview process with Ypsilanti's multi-faceted, he was asked to about directions he would like to steer the organization were he hired.", "card": "summary", "site": "@mlive"}, "article_date_updated": "Saturday, April 12, 2014,  5:25 AM", "parsely-metadata": "{\"short_title\": \"\", \"image_url\": \"http://media.mlive.com/annarbornews_impact/photo/040914-news-matthudson-mrm-jpg-3e9c4ccc0303f3f5.jpg\", \"author_name\": \"tperkins\", \"author_nickname\": \"Tom Perkins | Special to The Ann Arbor News\", \"author_id\": \"11076078\", \"source_blog_name\": \"Ann Arbor News\", \"source_blog_url\": \"http://www.mlive.com/news/ann-arbor/index.ssf/\", \"sponsored_content\": \"0\" }", "og": {"site_name": "MLive.com", "description": "When recently-hired Hope Clinic Director Matt Hudson was in the interview process with Ypsilanti's multi-faceted, he was asked to about directions he would like to steer the organization were he hired.", "title": "Under new leadership, Hope Clinic to take more spiritual approach to serving residents in need", "url": "http://www.mlive.com/news/ann-arbor/index.ssf/2014/04/under_new_leadership_hope_clin.html", "image": "http://image.mlive.com/home/mlive-media/width620/img/annarbornews_impact/photo/14679629-standard.jpg", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "MLive.com", "article": {"author": "http://"}, "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Saturday, April 12, 2014,  5:25 AM", "article_author": "Tom Perkins | Special to The Ann Arbor News", "Description": "When recently-hired Hope Clinic Director Matt Hudson was in the interview process with Ypsilanti's multi-faceted, he was asked to about directions he would like to steer the organization were he hired."}, "article_summary": "Hudson\u2019s unlikely path to the Hope Clinic started with a cerebral stroke in December 2012.\nHudson also underscored that while more poor residents are insured through Medicaid and the Affordable Health Care Act, Hope Clinic isn\u2019t turning anyone away who doesn\u2019t have insurance.\nWhen recently-hired Hope Clinic Director Matt Hudson was in the interview process with the Ypsilanti nonprofit, he was asked about where he'd like to steer the organization if he were hired.\nChief among those were increasing the spiritual and emotional role the Christian organization plays the lives of those it serves; establishing a Sunday church service; and raising more awareness in the community of the good things Hope Clinic accomplishes.\nThe medical clinic is at capacity, but the clinic\u2019s basement offers room for expansion, Hudson said, and that space could potentially be utilized for the new social work volunteers the clinic is bringing aboard."}
