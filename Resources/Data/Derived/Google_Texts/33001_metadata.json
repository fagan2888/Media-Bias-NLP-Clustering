In his will, he left 25 percent of his estate to the Libertarian Party (LP). After paying the estate's debts and expenses, that 25 percent came out to $217,734, a princely sum for the cash-strapped LP. According to the Libertarian National Committee (LNC), Burrington's gift would have covered the party's debts and ballot access costs for the 2008 election cycle. Unfortunately, the Federal Election Commission (FEC) told the LNC it could not accept the Burrington estate's bequest\u2014at least not all at once.\n\nIn a 1983 opinion, the FEC decided that contributions from a deceased person's estate should be treated the same as if it came from a living person. And federal law caps the amount of money a living person can give a national political party in a given year (presently $32,400). Therefore, the Burrington estate had to place the $217,734 in escrow and make annual distributions to the LP up to that year's contribution limit. The final payment is expected this year, seven years after Burrington's death.\n\nThree years ago, the LNC sued the FEC in federal court, alleging the restriction on Burrington's gift violated the First Amendment. The LNC wanted \u201cimmediate control of the balance of the Burrington Estate funds\u201d and a declaration that future bequests to the LP\u2014or any other political party\u2014would not be subject to FEC limits. The LNC also invoked a special section of federal campaign-finance law that requires certification of \u201cnon-frivolous\u201d constitutional questions directly to the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.\n\nLast year, U.S. District Judge Robert L. Wilkins agreed to certify only a narrower question: \u201cDoes imposing annual contribution limits against the bequest of Raymond Groves Burrington violate the First Amendment rights of the Libertarian National Committee?\u201d Wilkins said there could be no question as to whether the FEC violated Burrington's First Amendment rights, as he was dead. Nor, Wilkins said, could the LNC use this case to mount a broader assault on federal contribution limits. But he conceded the D.C. Circuit could find the LNC has a limited \u201cFirst Amendment right to receive campaign contributions\u201d as applied to the particular facts of the Burrington donation.\n\nPreventing Non-Existent Corruption\n\nOn February 7 of this year, the D.C. Circuit summarily affirmed Judge Wilkins' decision not to certify the LNC's broader constitutional challenge. The court has yet to rule on the narrower question, but in a February 3 filing, the FEC suggested the case is moot, because the LNC will receive its final, restricted payment from the Burrington estate this year. The FEC said there was no longer any need for the court to rule on this issue, because \u201cthere is no reasonable expectation that the Contribution Limit will restrict a bequest to the LNC again.\u201d The FEC snarked that the LP \u201chas never had a federal officeholder,\u201d never received a bequest anywhere near the size of Burrington's, and that \u201cit was highly unlikely\u201d anyone would make such a gift in the future given the party's minor status\n\nAnd yet, the FEC insists the contribution limit is necessary to prevent the \u201ccorruption\u201d of a politically irrelevant group like the LP. This makes no sense. After all, how could a dead man corrupt a party? The FEC offered a number of hypothetical scenarios where corruption might occur\u2014such as granting a potential donor access to party leaders in exchange for a promise to leave a gift through his estate\u2014but that had nothing to do with this case. By all accounts, the LNC had no knowledge of Burrington's bequest prior to his death. Burrington was not a party activist; records showed he previously made only a single contribution of $25 in 1998. Burrington's attorney told USA Today last year that he had \u201cno idea why Burrington donated to the party,\u201d and even Judge Wilkins acknowledged the LP offered nothing in exchange for the gift \u201capart from perhaps a simple expression of gratitude.\u201d\n\nJudge Wilkins suggested that even if there were \u201cvalid anti-corruption concerns,\u201d the FEC could deal with it \u201cthrough its disclosure and rulemaking authority.\u201d But the FEC maintains the eternal creed of the prohibitionist: To prevent some people from abusing a right, it is necessary to revoke everyone's rights. Even if that means trampling upon a minor party whose growth and success might serve as a more effective check upon major-party corruption than the FEC's unconstitutional mandates.\n\nOf course, that may be the point. As the FEC's own filings tacitly acknowledge, the contribution limit hurts third parties like the LP far more than the Democrats or Republicans. Unrestricted access to the Burrington gift, for instance, could have made a significant difference to the party in 2008. Larger parties have the resources to overcome the inconvenience of individual contribution limits; smaller parties do not.\n\nExporting Campaign Finance Hysteria\n\nCoincidentally, the issue raised by the Burrington lawsuit has become the subject of political debate north of the border. In Canada, the Conservative government recently introduced legislation to crack down on estate bequests to political parties. Historically, Canada has taken the opposite approach of the U.S.; donations from estates are not subject to the limits imposed on living donors. The Conservatives want to end that practice and impose an FEC-style rule.\n\nWhy? As the CBC's Kady O'Malley reported, \u201cJudging from past election flings, the move to crack down on the potential for undue political influence by the recently deceased is likely to be felt most keenly by the [opposition] New Democrats, who have collected nearly $1 million in bequests since 2007, including $50,000 from the estate of the party's late leader, Jack Layton, in 2012.\u201d Clearly, money corrupts politics when it disproportionately goes to the party that doesn't control the government.\n\nO'Malley expressed skepticism over the proposed change, noting the Conservatives failed to address estate contributions in a prior campaign finance reform law, and she wondered, \u201cwhat concerns have subsequently arisen that would justify a crackdown on contributions from the dearly departed.\u201d Maybe she should talk to the FEC. They'll be able to outline all sorts of \u201cconcerns\u201d; just don't ask them for any real-world examples of corruption.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "Could the dead rise up to ruin our political system?", "title": "The FEC Fears the Dead Will Corrupt Politics (Through the Libertarian Party)", "url": "http://reason.com/archives/2014/02/16/fec-thinks-the-libertarian-party-is-irre", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/13924057317634.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@reason", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/13924057317634.jpg", "description": "Raymond Groves Burrington, a\nTennessee day trader, died in 2007.
