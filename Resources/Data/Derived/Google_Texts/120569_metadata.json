John Kasich to target ICFs for downsizing in his latest budget.\n\nDisability Advocacy Alliance supporter Tamie Hopp thinks attempts to shrink ICFs are misguided.\n\n\u201cThe Kasich Administration\u2019s budget proposal would have resulted in thousands of individuals with profound intellectual and developmental disabilities and significant needs being forced from their ICF homes,\u201d Hopp said in an email to Ohio Watchdog.\n\nAs government affairs director at national developmental disabilities advocacy group VOR, Hopp helps Disability Advocacy Alliance and groups in other states navigate Medicaid policy changes.\n\nKasich\u2019s 2016-17 budget would build on existing state benchmarks limiting the size of ICFs, which typically save money by serving a large number of residents with a dedicated nursing staff at a single location.\n\nPressure on Ohio\u2019s ICFs has come from DRO and the Republican governor and from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, too. About two-thirds of the Medicaid benefits for ICF residents come from federal taxpayers.\n\n\u201cTragedies are predictable when individuals with significant needs are displaced from specialized care and separated from trained caregivers and instead placed in small, unlicensed settings with staff not trained to accommodate their needs,\u201d Hopp warned.\n\n\u201cAn analogous situation would be removing a patient from the ICU and attempting to serve that individual in his/her living room,\u201d she said. \u201cServing ICU patients in scattered locations is either cost prohibitive to do safely, or dangerous.\u201d\n\nHopp pointed to studies from Georgia and Virginia showing sharply increased mortality rates when developmentally disabled residents were moved from ICFs to \u201ccommunity-based care.\u201d\n\nRelocating ICF residents wouldn\u2019t just hurt those individuals, Hopp said \u2014 it could also increase medical wait times for other disabled Ohioans as former ICF residents \u201cmoved to the head of the line\u201d for care.\n\nThe Supreme Court\u2019s 1999 Olmstead vs. L.C. decision \u201csettled any dispute that undue segregation of a person with a disability is discrimination\u201d forbidden under federal law, DRO Executive Director Michael Kirkman told Ohio Watchdog.\n\n\u201cDRO\u2019s request to the state is that it create a system in Ohio that allows individuals real choice, not the false choice that currently exits,\u201d Kirkman said in an emailed statement.\n\n\u201cThousands of individuals in ICF institutions and day habilitation are on wait lists to move to the community; thousands may want to move to the community but would not receive adequate services under the current system to ensure their health and safety,\u201d he continued.\n\nWhen it comes to giving Medicaid recipients more options, there is some agreement between DRO and Disability Advocacy Alliance.\n\nBut in Ohio and elsewhere, critics fear the push for deinstitutionalization and an end to \u201csegregated\u201d services veers toward a one-size-fits-all approach by limiting access to ICFs.\n\n\u201cCommunity homes are needed for people who can handle and desire to live in the community, while large and small ICFs are necessary for those requiring higher levels of care,\u201d Hopp said.\n\n\u201cThis is what is envisioned in the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s Olmstead decision,\u201d she added. \u201cThis needs to be achieved through policies which do not pit the disabled population against each other.\u201d\n\nThe Ohio General Assembly removed budget language targeting ICFs, but has not finalized the 2016-17 state budget.
