DeMint would like the bank, which he calls \u201csocialist,\u201d to become a top target for Republicans this fall.\n\n\u201cCertainly there are issues of more long-term fiscal importance, but [there are] few issues that reveal the rot and corruption of Washington more clearly than this,\u201d DeMint says.\n\nConservative leaders, including the leaders of the anti-tax Club for Growth, Tea Party-supporting FreedomWorks and Heritage\u2019s political arm Heritage Action, have all called for the expiration of the bank\u2019s charter at the end of September. This would block the bank from backing new loans. Earlier this year at the Heritage Foundation, House Financial Services Committee Chairman Jeb Hensarling, a potential candidate for the next House Speaker, called the reauthorization of the bank a \u201cdefining issue\u201d for the GOP.\n\nRepublicans are divided over the bank\u2019s future, but there is enough Republican support in both chambers of Congress to reauthorize the bank\u2019s charter, according to a TIME analysis. The pro-buisness Chamber of Commerce has heralded the bank for supporting 200,000 jobs while reducing the deficit without raising taxes (it charges fees for its services). While DeMint, Hensarling and other conservatives call the bank a prime example of crony capitalism and corporate welfare, the Chamber notes that small- and medium-sized businesses account for more than 85% of Ex-Im\u2019s transactions.\n\nIn an interview with TIME, DeMint described why conservative groups like his own are making such a great deal over a little-known bank.\n\nIs there any issue greater than Ex-Im on the minds of conservatives today?\n\nCertainly there are issues of more long-term fiscal importance, but [there are] few issues that reveal the rot and corruption of Washington more clearly than this. Ex-Im issues taxpayer-subsidized loans for the politically connected that are rife with cases of fraud and waste. It\u2019s symptomatic of so much that is wrong with Washington. It\u2019s not necessary. It\u2019s expensive. It puts taxpayers on the hook for billions of dollars. It threatens American jobs, and it should be ended.\n\nConservatives believe in opportunity for all and favoritism to none. Ex-Im exists to provide subsidies to some of America\u2019s biggest corporations. It has led to allegations of kickbacks and bribes, with over 70 documented cases of corruption in recent years. Allowing the bank\u2019s charter to expire could build momentum for even greater reforms.\n\nWe can safely assume the Democratic-controlled Senate will include Ex-Im funding in their end of the year spending package. Would you prefer House Republicans shut down the government or pass the bill with the Ex-Im funding?\n\nI don\u2019t assume anything about what Congress will do on Ex-Im, but what is clear is that this is terrible economic policy that should end. Economists across the political spectrum acknowledge that subsidies, in general, and Ex-Im, in particular, do more harm than good. The vast majority of U.S. exports\u201498 percent\u2014do not receive any assistance from Ex-Im, and America does not need to adopt socialist policies to compete with Europe or any other countries.\n\nWould you support House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy if he allows a vote and Ex-Im passes, even if McCarthy himself opposes the bill?\n\nIf leaders in both parties put more focus on taxpayer concerns than special interest lobbyists, it\u2019s an easy call to end this corporate welfare. It was refreshing to hear a newly appointed leader like Mr. McCarthy join with Americans opposed to wasteful government programs. Our focus is on better policy, not politics. Allowing the Ex-Im charter to expire and ending the unnecessary subsidies to major corporations is sound policy.\n\nIf you were still in the Senate and you saw Republicans take back the chamber in the midterm elections, would you vote for Senator Mitch McConnell as Majority Leader?\n\nThat\u2019s a decision for politicians. At Heritage we\u2019re focused on developing policies that improve the lives of all Americans regardless of party.\n\nWould you prefer to see Rep. Jeb Hensarling or Rep. John Boehner as Speaker of the House?\n\nThese are decisions for members of Congress. Jeb is a strong conservative who should be applauded for leading on so many issues that put the interests of taxpayers ahead of special interests.\n\nDo you believe the President should be impeached, as former vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin has advocated? Do you agree with the House Republicans\u2019 choice to sue the Obama Administration over delaying the Affordable Care Act\u2019s employer mandate?\n\nWe\u2019ve not called for impeachment, but Congress and the public are right to be deeply troubled by President Obama\u2019s blatant disregard of the law. Time and time again, he has simply ignored laws he doesn\u2019t like. Any suit by the House of Representatives relating to this misconduct would certainly face procedural hurdles, but there\u2019s a strong case to be made if a judge were to reach the merits of a challenge.\n\nWhy is the GOP establishment winning in most of the primary races this year? Has the influence of the Tea Party peaked?\n\nHeritage is not involved in elections and doesn\u2019t endorse candidates. Conservatives want sound policies, and a vibrant debate helps to lead us there. The grassroots push to make Washington listen to the needs of Main Street instead of Wall Street have been a very helpful part of that debate. Tea Party groups have certainly given a voice to concerns shared by a majority of Americans about Washington\u2019s wasteful spending and debt, and they\u2019ve had an enormously positive impact since 2010.\n\nWill there be a conservative backlash to the Highway Trust Fund agreement reached by House Republicans and the President?\n\nThe highway program taxes drivers in all states and then diverts a huge amount of the revenue to boutique projects, like mass transit, in a few favored states. It should instead be focused on maintaining actual highway infrastructure\u2014roads and bridges\u2014throughout the country. The most efficient and effective means of doing just that is to keep gas tax revenues in the states, and allow states to decide spending priorities. Instead of bailing out mismanaged and wasteful Washington programs, we should be moving more dollars and decisions to the states where there\u2019s more accountability.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The conservative leader talks to TIME about the relevancy of the Tea Party and why conservatives hate the Export-Import bank", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "TIME.com", "description": "The conservative leader talks to TIME about the relevancy of the Tea Party and why conservatives hate the Export-Import bank", "title": "Jim DeMint: Bank Reveals Washington's 'Rot and Corruption'", "url": "http://time.com/2992711/jim-demint-interview/", "image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/jim-demint.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "TIME", "image": {"src": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/jim-demint.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012"}, "description": "The conservative leader talks to TIME about the relevancy of the Tea Party and why conservatives hate the Export-Import bank", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Jim DeMint: Bank Reveals Washington's 'Rot and Corruption'"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-tooltip": "Current & Breaking News | National & World Updates", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://time.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/2cee445ea71a179ffd35ea91cf154905?s=16", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "fb": {"app_id": 53177223193}, "p": {"domain_verify": "f48a8936c3fffc943fce516f2e3ff1d2"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/time2014/img/time-touch_icon_152.png", "application-name": "TIME", "keywords": "jim demint, heritage foundation, export-import bank, highway trust fund, conservatives", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/time"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "jim demint, heritage foundation, export-import bank, highway trust fund, conservatives"}, "article_summary": "Will there be a conservative backlash to the Highway Trust Fund agreement reached by House Republicans and the President?\nEx-Im issues taxpayer-subsidized loans for the politically connected that are rife with cases of fraud and waste.\nDo you agree with the House Republicans\u2019 choice to sue the Obama Administration over delaying the Affordable Care Act\u2019s employer mandate?\nWould you prefer House Republicans shut down the government or pass the bill with the Ex-Im funding?\nWould you support House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy if he allows a vote and Ex-Im passes, even if McCarthy himself opposes the bill?"}
