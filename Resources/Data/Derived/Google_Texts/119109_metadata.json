Research published in February found increasing the number of women in top management jobs just 30 percent can boost company profits 15 percent, FierceHealthcare previously reported.\n\nThe report follows a survey last November that found hospital leadership diversity is improving, but at far too slow a pace. Women and ethnic minorities, in particular, found the march of progress too sluggish: Only 26 percent of minorities believe healthcare is closing the leadership gap--fewer than half of their white counterparts--while less than a third of female respondents believe the gap is closing.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- download the report (.pdf)\n\n- read the Becker's article\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nHealthcare leadership diversity improving, but there's a long way to go\n\nWomen leaders could boost hospital profits\n\nHow Henry Ford Health System, Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital improved healthcare disparities\n\nHow increased diversity will change the business of healthcare\n\n4 ways to tackle healthcare disparities\n\nHealthcare fails women of color in states across the country", "article_metadata": {"description": "The hospital sector and other businesses lag behind in gender parity,\u00a0according to\u00a0a new report from McKinsey & Company and Lean In.
