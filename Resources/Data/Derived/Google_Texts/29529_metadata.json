We cannot continue to compromise their future. So, we\u2019re going to get to a balanced budget very quickly. And I think take about three years to do that. If the only thing you do is not increase the federal spending, just that one simple thing. We\u2019re going to do a lot more than that, because the government is very big and very bloated. So, the next thing i\u2019m going to do is start reducing that 4.1 million federal employees, and I\u2019ll do it by attrition. Tens of thousands retire each year. There\u2019s absolutely no reason to replace them. We can shift people where they need to be. I will call in the directors of all those agencies, 645 federal agencies and subagencies and say \u2018Cut your budget by 2% to 3%, or resign, whichever is easier for you. We\u2019ll get a replacement for you. And do it in a way that the people won\u2019t feel it.'\u201d\n\nFollow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett", "article_metadata": {"description": "Carson: Demand Agency Heads Cut Budgets By 2-3% or Resign, And Do So In a Way People Won't Feel It", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Carson: Demand Agency Heads Cut Budgets By 2-3% or Resign, And Do So In a Way People Won't Feel It", "title": "Carson: Demand Agency Heads Cut Budgets By 2-3% or Resign, And Do So In a Way People Won't Feel It - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/02/Carson-210-Thumbnail.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/video/2016/02/10/carson-demand-agency-heads-cut-budgets-by-2-3-or-resign-and-do-so-in-a-way-people-wont-feel-it/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Carson: Demand Agency Heads Cut Budgets By 2-3% or Resign, And Do So In a Way People Won't Feel It", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/02/Carson-210-Thumbnail.jpg", "title": "Carson: Demand Agency Heads Cut Budgets By 2-3% or Resign, And Do So In a Way People Won't Feel It - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Balanced Budget, Ben Carson, Government Spending,2016 Presidential Race, Breitbart TV,Carson", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "2016 Presidential Race", "tag": "Government Spending", "published_time": "2016-02-10T20:31:52-07:00", "categories": "Breitbart TV,2016 Presidential Race"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "So, the next thing i\u2019m going to do is start reducing that 4.1 million federal employees, and I\u2019ll do it by attrition.\nAnd do it in a way that the people won\u2019t feel it.\nIf the only thing you do is not increase the federal spending, just that one simple thing.\nWe\u2019re going to do a lot more than that, because the government is very big and very bloated.\nI will call in the directors of all those agencies, 645 federal agencies and subagencies and say \u2018Cut your budget by 2% to 3%, or resign, whichever is easier for you."}
