That\u2019s how former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill famously described the behavior of Russia and its politicians. The problem for investors is that figuring whether \u2014 and how \u2014 to invest in the country never seems to get any easier than deciphering the behavior of leaders like Joseph Stalin or Vladimir Putin.\n\nThat isn\u2019t going to stop some from dabbling for bargains in blue-chip energy companies like Gazprom, Lukoil or Norilsk Nickel, betting simultaneously on a global commodities market recovery and that Russia won\u2019t spend too much time in the shadow of the world\u2019s disapproval.\n\nRelated: Big Risks Seen in Putin\u2019s Idea to Beef Up Gazprom\n\nThere was some logic behind that argument back in mid-March, when the iShares MSCI Russia Capped Index ETF (one measure of the market\u2019s performance) was trading down 28 percent year-to-date. Indeed, at that point the Russian occupation of the Crimean peninsula \u2014 until then, Ukrainian territory \u2014 and the growing tensions between the two nations had caused a selloff that left blue-chip Russian shares trading nearly 60 percent below their 2008 highs. \u201cWhen an asset has fallen that far, it\u2019s usually oversold,\u201d asserted Brett Arends at Quartz, explaining his decision to jump back into the Russian stock market with both feet back at the beginning of March. \u201cThe market has given up and lost interest.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s another possibility of course: Investors were just terrified of what might happen next. Geopolitically, things have deteriorated steadily since then. True, the Ukrainian elections did take place, but that\u2019s no guarantee that tensions in the eastern portion of Ukraine will abate. Ahead of those elections, with chocolate magnate and pragmatist Petro Poroshenko widely seen as likely to win the presidency, Russian stocks rallied. Poroshenko has personal business ties to Russia; the Russian political establishment has made it clear that they\u2019re just fine with him in driver\u2019s seat next door in Ukraine.\n\nRelated: Ukraine\u2019s New Leader Stands Up to Moscow\n\nThat cleared the way for a big rebound in Russian stocks from their lows. In the last month, the Market Vectors Russia ETF has rallied about 12 percent. That still means it\u2019s down more than 8 percent so far this year, but it\u2019s a far cry from the 27 percent loss investors were eyeing as of mid-March. As always, however, it has been a matter of buying the rumor and selling the news: Russian stocks have been falling once more now that investors are free to look around and worry about something else.\n\nAnd if you\u2019re looking for a reason to be jittery, you\u2019ve got plenty to pick from.\n\nWhile the crisis has cooled off, economic sanctions imposed by the United States and the European Union remain. On balance, that\u2019s going to make risk-averse institutional investors more likely to lighten their holdings of Russian stocks and bonds and look for other places to park their cash, however appealing the bargains in the Russian markets look. Even the SEC has suggested that this might not be the best time to be investing in Russia. Not a very good sign.\n\nHerman Gref, CEO of Sberbank, which holds about half of all Russian deposits, warned an economic forum recently that the country\u2019s economy could stagnate and that the Ukraine crisis is taking a bigger toll than he had anticipated. The International Monetary Fund, for its part, has said Russia may already be in a recession, as everything from consumer confidence to capital investment takes a nosedive.\n\nThe landmark 30-year deal to supply China with massive quantities of natural gas couldn\u2019t have come at a better time for Russia. It signals that the country doesn\u2019t have to rely only on European markets for its oil and gas reserves. More broadly, the deal also is a reminder that Russian companies can generate profits by developing fresh markets with new trading partners.\n\nRelated: Obama\u2019s Energy Plan Is a Gift to Russia and China\n\nAs with so many other developments involving Russia, what is obvious is how potentially transformative, both economically and politically, this $400 billion gas sale will be for both countries.\n\nWhere it once again becomes tricky is how an investor can position himself to make a profit from it. Invest in Gazprom, the company that will be developing this brand new market, diversifying its customer base and profiting from a big new sale? Not so fast. Gazprom\u2019s domestic markets are stagnant, it faces big unpaid bill for gas from Ukraine, and then there are those sanctions looming on the horizon.\n\nOn top of that, the company \u2013 or the Russian government \u2013 will need to figure out how to pay its share of the sky-high development costs to build the new China pipeline. No wonder Bank of America Merrill Lynch cut their rating on Gazprom\u2019s stock to a hold from buy.\n\nSometimes, bargain-priced merchandise is cheap for a very good reason.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Figuring whether \u2014 and how \u2014 to invest in Russia never seems to get any easier than deciphering the behavior of leaders like Joseph Stalin or Vladimir Putin.", "title": "BRIC by BRIC: Buying into Putin\u2019s Russia Is No Bargain", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2014/06/10/BRIC-BRIC-Buying-Putin-s-Russia-No-Bargain", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/06102014_Putin_BRICS.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2014/06/10/BRIC-BRIC-Buying-Putin-s-Russia-No-Bargain", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/06102014_Putin_BRICS.jpg", "creator": "@SuzMcGeeNYC", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Figuring whether \u2014 and how \u2014 to invest in Russia never seems to get any easier than deciphering the behavior of leaders like Joseph Stalin or Vladimir Putin.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdead5\"", "article_summary": "Ahead of those elections, with chocolate magnate and pragmatist Petro Poroshenko widely seen as likely to win the presidency, Russian stocks rallied.\nRelated: Ukraine\u2019s New Leader Stands Up to MoscowThat cleared the way for a big rebound in Russian stocks from their lows.\nIn the last month, the Market Vectors Russia ETF has rallied about 12 percent.\nThat\u2019s how former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill famously described the behavior of Russia and its politicians.\nThe landmark 30-year deal to supply China with massive quantities of natural gas couldn\u2019t have come at a better time for Russia."}
