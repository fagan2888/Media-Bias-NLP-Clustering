In this 4th episode of the Dough Roller Podcast, I interview Nate Purpura of eHealth. Nate and the folks at eHealth are experts when it comes to Obamacare. Given all of the questions and uncertainties surrounding the Affordable Care Act, I was thrilled when Nate agreed to come on the show.

The Topics Covered on the Show

We covered just about every topic relevant to Obamacare in this nearly one hour interview, including the following:

How the Obamacare subsidies work and how you can determine whether you qualify

Whether you can keep your existing health insurance policy even if it doesn’t meet the new standards under Obamacare

How the platinum, gold, silver and bronze plans work

What the out-of-pocket caps are and how they work for both individuals and families

Why those who do not receive a subsidy will have more health care insurance options and how to find these additional choices

Whether you can switch plans in the middle of the year

What are “qualifying events” that might allow you to change plans in the middle of the year

Whether it’s a good idea to wait until you’re sick before buying insurance

How to determine if a health plan covers your existing doctors and area hospitals

Why the cost of health insurance is going up

How your age affects the premiums you’ll pay

How Obamacare subsidies are calculated and tools to help you determine your eligibility

In addition, Nate and I discuss those states that may allow individuals to keep their existing insurance plans. Please note that this is a developing issue with changes announced almost daily. Best on our best information, the table below gives the current status by state. Before making any decisions, however, be sure to confirm this information with the exchange in your state.
