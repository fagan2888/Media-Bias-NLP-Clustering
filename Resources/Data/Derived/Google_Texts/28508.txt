Valdosta, GA - Bobby Goddard is a Valdosta High School freshman. He said "you got to make sure that this is what you really want to do because this is your life, your career."

Beginning this year freshman in all public high schools in Georgia will have to choose a career path to focus on in school. They can pick from seventeen different industries known as "clusters" and choose a specific kind of job known as a "pathway".

Brian Law is a Valdosta High School Counselor. He said "by choosing that pathway out of the different clusters we provide information on what the actual job that they potentially would be doing, what they do on the job as well as the wages and salaries so they can look at and say when I finish college this is what I'm going to be making."

Critics of the program argue a high school freshman may not be capable of making a decision that could have a life-long impact. But freshman Bobby Goddard sees it as a positive.

Goddard went on to say "it definitely makes me less nervous because with this pathway system I know I'll be able to get a good feel of it before I can make the decision whether or not I can actually master in this or have a career."

Goddard chose science as his pathway and is interested in being a bio-chemist.

The state program is part of a national trend to align coursework with the needs of employers.
