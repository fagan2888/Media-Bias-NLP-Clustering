The final agreement forged in Vienna in mid-July by the U.S., Iran and five other major powers would curtail Iran\u2019s capability to develop a nuclear weapon for the next 15 years while lifting economic and oil sanctions against Tehran.\n\nWith 29 Senate Democrats publicly announcing in favor of the nuclear deal and just five more needed to sustain the president\u2019s veto, the White House appeared buoyant but not overly confident on Wednesday. \u201cSo, there are several indications that we are succeeding in our efforts to build sufficient support for the agreement in Congress, but we certainly want to collect as many votes as possible,\u201d White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest told reporters.\n\nRelated: Did Republicans Just Give Up on Killing the Iran Deal?\n\nObama, fresh from his vacation, tried to keep the heat up with appearances on TV stations in Detroit, Philadelphia, Seattle and the Washington, D.C. area. His appeals for approval of the Iran deal were clearly aimed at undecided Democratic senators, including Gary Peters of Michigan, Bob Casey of Pennsylvania, Corey Booker of New Jersey, Christopher Coons of Delaware, Maria Cantwell of Washington, Mark Warner of Virginia and Benjamin Cardin of Maryland.\n\nThe turning point came last weekend, when Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV) warmly embraced the Iran deal as good for both the U.S. and Israel. He suggested that if the trend continues, the Democrats might not only be able to sustain a veto but actually prevent the Republicans from even bringing up a resolution of disapproval in the face of a Democratic filibuster.\n\n\u201cAs far as procedurally stopping this bill from moving forward, I am not giving up hope on that,\u201d Reid said, according to Roll Call. \u201cI know it\u2019s a longshot, but I hope that it can be done. We\u2019ll just have to see because right now \u2026 we still have a lot of uncounted votes.\u201d\n\nReid, who will retire from the Senate at the end of next year, typically has plenty of tricks up his sleeve. And it\u2019s possible he could muster the 41 Democratic votes that would be required prevent cloture and block a final vote on the resolution.\n\nRelated: The Iran Side Deals -- The GOP\u2019s New Reason to Vote \u2018No\u2019\n\nBut Corker and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) have tricks of their own they might use as a fallback in the event Obama thwarts the GOP assault on the nuclear deal.\n\nOne would be the \u201cpoison pill\u201d approach, in which McConnell would open the resolution to a series of politically flammable amendments that would put wavering Democrats on the spot and enable the Republicans to score political points, even if they don\u2019t prevail.\n\nA few of those amendments were offered earlier this year by Sens. Marco Rubio (R-FL), Tom Cotton (R-ARK) and other conservatives, and include making adoption of the nuclear deal contingent on Iran recognizing the state of Israel and the release of three American hostages.\n\nAnother approach that Corker is promoting is for the Senate to come back later with some very strong legislative provisions that would keep the economic pressure on Iran and come down hard if Iranian leaders later violate the terms of the agreement. The idea would be to somehow keep Iran boxed in with the threat of a renewed array of economic sanctions.\n\nRelated: Kerry to Congress -- Sign the Iran Deal or the Dollar Gets Hit\n\n\u201cI think what Congress will do is come back around with some very, very strong provisions relative to Iran, but also probably some very strong provisions relative to some regional \u2026 strategy that is very supportive of allies that we have in the region,\u201d Corker said in Tennessee yesterday.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "As the odds improve that President Obama will prevail in getting the U.S.-Iran nuclear", "title": "Facing Defeat on Iran Nuclear Deal, Republicans Ponder Plan B", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/08/27/Facing-Defeat-Iran-Nuclear-Deal-Republicans-Ponder-Plan-B", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/08072013_Iranian_Nuclear_Plant_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/08/27/Facing-Defeat-Iran-Nuclear-Deal-Republicans-Ponder-Plan-B", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/08072013_Iranian_Nuclear_Plant_article.jpg", "creator": "@ericpianin", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "As the odds improve that President Obama will prevail in getting the U.S.-Iran nuclear", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf775\"", "article_summary": "Related: Did Republicans Just Give Up on Killing the Iran Deal?\nAnd it\u2019s possible he could muster the 41 Democratic votes that would be required prevent cloture and block a final vote on the resolution.\nThe turning point came last weekend, when Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV) warmly embraced the Iran deal as good for both the U.S. and Israel.\nMarco Rubio (R-FL), Tom Cotton (R-ARK) and other conservatives, and include making adoption of the nuclear deal contingent on Iran recognizing the state of Israel and the release of three American hostages.\nAs the odds improve that President Obama will prevail in getting the U.S.-Iran nuclear deal past a recalcitrant Congress next month, GOP leaders already have begun concocting a face-saving plan B to take a parting shot at the controversial nuclear non-proliferation agreement."}
