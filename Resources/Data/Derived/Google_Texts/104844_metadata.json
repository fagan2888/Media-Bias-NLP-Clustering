Rhem, \"Camp Delta,\" wikipedia.org, Feb. 16, 2005 On Tuesday, Feb. 23, 2016, President Obama announced his plan to permanently close the Guantanamo Bay detention camp in Cuba and transfer any remaining detainees to a secure location somewhere in the United States.\n\n\n\nDuring his 2008 presidential campaign President Obama argued in favor of closing Guantanamo Bay. Since taking office, President Obama's administration has transferred 147 detainees out of Guantanamo. There are currently 91 detainees still held at the prison.\n\n\n\nThe President stated that, \"the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay does not advance our national security - it undermines it. It's counterproductive to our fight against terrorists, who use it as propaganda in their efforts to recruit. It drains military resources, with nearly $450 million spent last year alone to keep it running and more than $200 million in additional costs needed to keep it open going forward. Guantanamo harms our partnerships with allies and other countries whose cooperation we need against terrorism.\"\n\n\n\nAfter announcing his plan to shut down the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, the 2016 presidential candidates weighed in on President Obama's decision.\n\n\n\nBEN CARSON\n\n\n\nMSNBC with Thomas Roberts , Ben Carson said:\n\n\n\n\"Well, if it was such a good idea [closing Guantanamo bay] I guess it would have been done seven years ago. Obviously it's not a great idea and I don't support it. And, you know, the assumption is that all Presidents coming after him [President Obama] will also think it's a good idea. It's, I think, ill-conceived if you think it is better to kill people, rather than to capture them and obtain information from them, then I guess you like this idea [to close Guantanamo].\"\n\n\n\nMSNBC Live with Thomas Roberts , \"Carson: I Don't Support Closing Guantanamo Bay,\" msnbc.com, Feb. 23, 2016\n\n\n\nHILLARY CLINTON\n\n\n\nWhen asked if she agrees with President Obama's plan to close Guantanamo, Hillary Clinton stated the following during the Feb. 23, 2016 CNN Town Hall Democratic forum:\n\n\n\n\"I have been on record in favor of closing Guantanamo for a long time, since 2008. When I was Secretary of State, working closely with the President, I had a special envoy to find places that could take back some of the prisoners... I believe the President is right to try to close it. I think it is a continuing recruitment advertisement for terrorists...\n\n\n\nThere is no reason for us to continue to have Guantanamo.\"\n\n\n\nStephen Collinson, \"CNN Town Hall: Clinton, Sanders Make Pitch to Minority Voters,\" cnn.com, Feb. 23, 2016\n\n\n\nTED CRUZ\n\n\n\nDuring a Feb. 23, 2016 campaign rally in South Fernley Nevada, Ted Cruz stated:\n\n\n\n\"You know, just today President Obama announced his plans to try to shut down Guantanamo terrorist detention facility.\n\n\n\nLet me say this Mr. President, don't shut down Gitmo, expand it, and let's have some new terrorists there.\n\n\n\nHow on earth does any President look in the eyes of a mother or father, whose son or daughter lost their lives capturing these terrorists and justify - we're going to release 'em again when we know a very high percentage of them are going to return to waging jihad.\"\n\n\n\nDavid Weigel, \"Cruz Warns That Obama Will Hand Guantanamo Base Over to the Castro\u2019s,\" washingtonpost.com, Feb. 23, 2016\n\n\n\nJOHN KASICH\n\n\n\nIn a Feb. 23, 2016 interview on the Fox News Channel, John Kasich said:\n\n\n\n\"I don't favor closing Gitmo. I don't understand it. Look, these are people, some of whom are the worst of the worst. And why would we send them into our country? I just don't understand it. So, look, he promised it in the campaign, when my people said this morning he was going to do this, I said, 'Why is he doing this?' They said, 'Campaign promise.' So, all I can tell you is I profoundly disagree.\u201d\n\n\n\nAmerica's Newsroom , \"Kasich: 'I Profoundly Disagree' with Closing Gitmo,\" video.foxnews.com, Feb. 23, 2016\n\n\n\nMARCO RUBIO\n\n\n\nDuring a campaign event in Nevada on Feb. 23, 2016, Marco Rubio stated:\n\n\n\n\"You wake up this morning to the news that the president is planning to close Guantanamo \u2014 maybe even giving it back to the Cuban government\u2026\n\n\n\n[W]e're not going to close Guantanamo.
