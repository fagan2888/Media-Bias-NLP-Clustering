Chris Wallace doesn’t have faith that his Fox News colleague Dr. Ben Carson could win in 2016 should he decide to run for president.

Carson, a hero among conservatives for his vocal opposition to Obamacare and other liberal policies, has said that he is considering a presidential bid. He even has a potential campaign chairman picked out.

Asked on KFTK’s Allman in the Morning show whether he believes Carson would actually run, Wallace said he wasn’t sure. “Do I think he has a serious chance to be president?” Wallace said. “I don’t. No.”

He added that he wasn’t disparaging Carson, who has never held elective office, but that “certain skills” are needed to effectively govern the country. “We think, ‘well, you don’t really need a professional politician to run the country,'” Wallace said. “To me, it would be like saying we don’t need a professional manager to run General Motors or something.”

Carson joined Fox News as a contributor in late 2013.
