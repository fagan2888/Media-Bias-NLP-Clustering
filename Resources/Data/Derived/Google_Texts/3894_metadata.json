No, this time fans of \u201cA Song of Ice and Fire\u201d (the book series on which HBO\u2019s \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d is based) are at the source of the hotter-than-wildfire reproach.\n\nOn Monday, Linda Antonsson \u2014 co-owner of Westeros.org, a popular \u201cA Song of Ice and Fire\u201d/\u201dGame of Thrones\u201d fan-site and co-author of \u201cThe World of Ice and Fire,\u201d along with her husband, Elio Garcia, and the man himself, George R.R. Martin \u2014 fired off a series of tweets critical of the show and showrunners David Benioff and Dan Weiss. Specifically, she took issue with Benioff and Weiss revealing Stannis would burn his daughter Shireen in the series\u2019 next book, \u201cThe Winds of Winter,\u201d which has yet to be released. Obviously, this is a massive spoiler for book readers \u2014 seeing Stannis burn Shireen on television alone wouldn\u2019t have meant he\u2019d do it in the books, since there are characters who are dead in the show but still alive in \u201cA Song of Ice and Fire\u201d (and vice versa), and this season in particular has diverged from the book series in many significant ways.\n\nBut Benioff and Weiss felt the need to confirm the spoiler, and Antonsson, for one, was not happy, leveling scathing criticism at the two writers, whom she refers to as \u201cDumb and Dumber\u201d:\n\nOutright saying that knew from GRRM that Stannis would sacrifice Shireen is incredibly rude to GRRM and the book readers. \u2014 Linda & Elio (@hippoiathanatoi) June 8, 2015\n\nI imagine they knew there'd be outrage, so they probably wanted to \"blame\" GRRM. Alternatively, they are as stupid as I have suspected. \u2014 Linda & Elio (@hippoiathanatoi) June 8, 2015\n\nShe then later wrote that her anger mostly stemmed from a feeling of betrayal:\n\nOne reason that I am so furious about this betrayal from D&D is that we have made every effort on http://t.co/LZXMx9OfIb... \u2014 Linda & Elio (@hippoiathanatoi) June 8, 2015\n\n...to respect HBO's wishes about not posting leaks from sets, leaked episodes, etc, regardless of our views about the show. \u2014 Linda & Elio (@hippoiathanatoi) June 8, 2015\n\nWe were furious about people leaking the first four episodes and betraying HBO's trust in sending out the screeners. \u2014 Linda & Elio (@hippoiathanatoi) June 8, 2015\n\nBut apparently they couldn't care less about not throwing in totally unnecessary spoilers in their promotional material around the episode. \u2014 Linda & Elio (@hippoiathanatoi) June 8, 2015\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first instance of a book reader voicing profound discontent with the show, just a recent and high-profile instance. A community on Tumblr is thriving around critiquing the show and favoring the books. Popular blogs like Game of Thrones Gifs and Musings and The Cultural Vacuum regularly skewer the show\u2019s often nonsensical plots (Jaime going on a secret mission to Dorne just to find out he could\u2019ve had Myrcella back if he had just asked nicely \u2014 oops!), poor characterizations (Stannis deciding to burn his daughter because of some snow and dead horses), unbelievably clumsy foreshadowing (with a blog devoted to this topic alone; it\u2019s Chekhov\u2019s gun, guys, not Chekhov\u2019s atomic explosion), over-the-top and unnecessary sex/nudity (boner-activated Dornish poison because \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af ) and often boggling treatment of its female characters (the rape of Sansa, a badass Wildling warrior woman\u2019s undoing stemming from her maternal instincts). The two bloggers even collaborated to pen a hilarious \u201cBook Snob Glossary\u201d and make a \u201cBook Snob Bingo\u201d card.\n\nAnd let\u2019s not forget the Westeros.org \u201crant and rave\u201d threads centered around the show, with page counts reaching into the hundreds.\n\nPerhaps the most salient criticism anti-\u201cGame of Thrones\u201d proponents make is that the show robs the set piece moments from the books of their proper context.
