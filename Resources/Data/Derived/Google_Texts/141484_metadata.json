Billy Farrell Agency\n\nLOS ANGELES \u2013 To the list of cultural touchstones that have Joni Mitchell\u2019s stamp on them, we can add this: \u201cYou complete me.\u201d One of the all-time famous movie lines, delivered by Tom Cruise to Renee Zellweger in \u201cJerry Maguire,\u201d was an homage to Mitchell\u2019s \u201cCourt and Spark,\u201d the movie\u2019s writer and director, Cameron Crowe, told a Los Angeles gala crowd on Saturday night.\n\nMitchell\u2019s lyric goes, \u201cAnd you could complete me / I\u2019d complete you,\u201d and Crowe said the line has gotten him in trouble with viewers who think it\u2019s a pretty narcissistic way to woo someone.\n\n\u201cI say it\u2019s a tribute to Joni Mitchell and \u2018Court and Spark,\u2019\u201d said Crowe. \u201cShuts them right up.\u201d\n\nMitchell did a good job of that herself on Saturday, when she was honored by the city\u2019s Hammer Museum at the organization\u2019s 12th annual Gala in the Garden. Mitchell didn\u2019t sing, but instead found the \u201csweet spot\u201d of the microphone like a pro to deliver a spirited acceptance speech that touched on two projects unexpected for an artist best known for songs like \u201cBig Yellow Taxi\u201d and \u201cBoth Sides Now\u201d \u2013 painting and ballet.\n\nThere are plans to adapt a forthcoming four-disc set of music for ballet performances, she said. And this being an art museum, Mitchell described the time she spends painting \u2013 avoiding the \u201ctic\u2019s\u201d of psychotic, neurotic and erotic art for pieces that are something like Matisse \u2013 or as she described it, \u201cjoyous things for tired businessmen.\u201d\n\nMitchell was honored with Mark Bradford, a Los Angeles artist whose paintings and collages have earned him a MacArthur Fellowship and the Department of State\u2019s Medal of Arts. Growing up, he divided his time between his home in Santa Monica and his mother\u2019s hair salon in South Los Angeles \u2013 an area not better, or worse, than the White House, he said \u2013 just \u201cdifferent.\u201d\n\nJulia Roberts Billy Farrell Agency\n\nThe stars were out in the museum\u2019s open-air courtyard. Rita Wilson seemed like a bit of a prom queen, hopping from conversation to conversation with fellow actresses Demi Moore and Molly Shannon. Julia Roberts crouched down to talk with Mitchell as the singer held court in the middle of the room, and Hollywood mega-agent Ari Emanuel swung by because he\u2019s a big fan of Bradford. \u201cGlee\u201d actresses Dianna Agron and Jane Lynch were spotted, too. Singer Sia performed a small set of songs, including her hit \u201cChandelier.\u201d\n\nTomas Maier, creative director of Bottega Veneta, served as one of five co-chairs, and the luxury brand dressed attendees that included Orlando Bloom, Rashida Jones and Elizabeth Banks.\n\nOne of the museum\u2019s current exhibits, a Jim Hodges collection titled \u201cGive More Than You Take,\u201d seemed well-timed. Museum director Ann Philbin said the event raised $2.5 million.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "Musician Joni Mitchell and artist Mark Bradford were honored by the city\u2019s Hammer Museum at the organization\u2019s 12th annual Gala in the Garden.", "title": "Inside the Hammer Museum Gala Honoring Joni Mitchell, Mark Bradford", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2014/10/12/inside-the-hammer-museum-gala-honoring-joni-mitchell-mark-bradford/", "image": {"src": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-EY821_joni_P_20141012155653.jpg"}, "site": "WSJspeakeasy", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Arts", "article.headline": "Inside the Hammer Museum Gala Honoring Joni Mitchell, Mark Bradford", "description": "Musician Joni Mitchell and artist Mark Bradford were honored by the city\u2019s Hammer Museum at the organization\u2019s 12th annual Gala in the Garden.", "article_section": "Arts", "author": "Erich Schwartzel", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "testkeys": "C", "article.page": "Speakeasy Blog", "page.subsection": "Speakeasy", "article.summary": "Musician Joni Mitchell and artist Mark Bradford were honored by the city\u2019s Hammer Museum at the organization\u2019s 12th annual Gala in the Garden.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "page.content.format": "responsive", "article.published": "2014-10-12T20:02:33-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-142", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2014/10/12/inside-the-hammer-museum-gala-honoring-joni-mitchell-mark-bradford/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-SEB-84043", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Arts", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "Musician Joni Mitchell and artist Mark Bradford were honored by the city\u2019s Hammer Museum at the organization\u2019s 12th annual Gala in the Garden.", "title": "Inside the Hammer Museum Gala Honoring Joni Mitchell, Mark Bradford", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2014/10/12/inside-the-hammer-museum-gala-honoring-joni-mitchell-mark-bradford/", "image": {"width": 749, "identifier": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-EY821_joni_P_20141012155653.jpg", "height": 499}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Speakeasy", "article.id": "BL-SEB-84043", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2014-10-13T00:18:12-04:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf949\"", "article_summary": "Joni Mitchell at the Hammer Museum\u2019s Gala in the Garden, where she was honored.\n\u201cI say it\u2019s a tribute to Joni Mitchell and \u2018Court and Spark,\u2019\u201d said Crowe.\nMuseum director Ann Philbin said the event raised $2.5 million.\n\u201cShuts them right up.\u201dMitchell did a good job of that herself on Saturday, when she was honored by the city\u2019s Hammer Museum at the organization\u2019s 12th annual Gala in the Garden.\nOne of the museum\u2019s current exhibits, a Jim Hodges collection titled \u201cGive More Than You Take,\u201d seemed well-timed."}
