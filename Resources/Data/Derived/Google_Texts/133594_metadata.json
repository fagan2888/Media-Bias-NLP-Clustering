If Republicans in Congress aren\u2019t perpetually voting to repeal the Affordable Care Act to rob millions of healthcare, they are cutting Medicare or refusing to accept free Medicaid expansion in Republican-controlled states.\n\nHowever, as unbelievable as it may seem, and it is unbelievable, one Republican state\u2019s legislature voted unanimously to extend healthcare to help rural and poor Floridians. It was not good news for the poor though, because the most powerful Republican in the state vetoed a bill that passed both houses of the legislature unanimously; seemingly out of sheer spite and contempt for the vulnerable because it provided access to healthcare.\n\nGovernor Rick Scott must have it in for poor and low-income Floridians, particularly those in need of access to any kind of healthcare. In this latest Republican atrocity it was a one-man effort that went against the unanimous wishes of the Republican majority legislature. In the past, Scott had the backing and assistance from Republicans to close down women\u2019s access to healthcare and reject Medicaid expansion, but this time he rejected the wishes of his fellow Republicans. One wonders if that woman who accosted him at a coffee shop a couple of weeks ago will be stalking him to unleash another \u201cYou\u2019re an asshole\u201d rant on the governor.\n\nWhen the woman confronted Scott for refusing to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) to low-income residents, Scott said his excuse was that he did not want Florida to get involved in a federal program like Medicaid. And yet in his veto of HB 139, he claimed helping poor and rural Floridians was unnecessary and wasteful because they already have great dental care from Medicaid; except for the 800,000 or so Floridians who suffer the GOP Medicaid rejection complex.\n\nThe Republican-introduced bill simply created \u201ca grants program aimed at dentists to serve patients in counties with a shortage of dentists or in otherwise medically underserved areas.\u201d The grants, ranging from $10,000 to $100,000 were set to be administered by the Department of Health. Mr. Scott wrote in his veto letter that he thought \u201cmaintaining good oral health is integral to the overall health of Florida families.\u201d But he was not about to \u201csupport a program that does not safeguard taxpayer investments;\u201d whatever that was supposed to mean.\n\nA spokesman from the Florida Dental Association (FDA) said the group was \u201cdisappointed because the legislation would have provided significant support for promoting dental care, economic development and job growth in underserved areas of Florida.\u201d The FDA\u2019s Director of Governmental Affairs, Joe Anne Hart, continued that,\n\n\u201cThe challenges of accessing routine dental care have critically impacted the health and success of Florida communities, especially in rural areas. The results are repeated visits to the emergency room for preventable dental problems, missed days of school due to toothaches, and lower GPAs and graduation rates. We will continue to advocate for statewide policies and programs to improve oral health for all Floridians.\u201d\n\nIt appeared that the FDA\u2019s advocacy worked exceedingly well on both houses of Florida\u2019s Republican-controlled legislature, but contemptible Rick Scott was unmoved.\n\nUnlike when Scott and Republicans claimed they rejected Medicaid expansion and access to healthcare for 800,000 Floridians, it was alleged to be due to the exorbitant cost to the state. Scott never complained about the cost of HB 139; it made his veto all the more cruel and contemptible.\n\nIt is worth noting that Medicaid expansion is no cost to the state for the first two years and then it is only 10 percent of the total cost every year to cover an additional 800,000 Floridians. So expanding Medicaid, like shutting down women\u2019s access to public healthcare, is not about money. Rick Scott just dislikes women as much as he hates Florida\u2019s poor and low income residents having access to what is arguably \u201cfree\u201d healthcare for at least two years, and now access to more dental providers in underserved rural areas.\n\nIf the woman who unleashed Hell on Scott at a Starbucks store last weeks would have known the full extent of Scott\u2019s cruel contempt for the poor having access to healthcare, she would likely have called the governor a lot more than an \u201casshole.\u201d She said,\n\n\u201cYou strip women of access to public health care. Shame on you, Rick Scott! We depend on those services. When poor people like us need health services, you cut them. You cut Medicaid. You\u2019re an asshole. You don\u2019t care about working people. You should be ashamed to show your face around here. Shame on you, Rick Scott! You\u2019re an embarrassment to our state.\u201d\n\nRick Scott is an embarrassment to America, and humanity for that matter. He certainly must have embarrassed the Republican-dominated legislature by rejecting what should have been a veto-proof bill. One hardly ever hears about any legislature unanimously passing anything, much less a Republican-majority legislature passing a bill to help the poor and underserved. That woman who railed on Governor Scott was only half right in labeling him an \u201casshole.\u201d He is worse; he is a cruel barbaric Republican and this time his cruel contempt for the poor likely surprised even his own cruel Republican-dominated legislature.", "article_metadata": {"description": "\"Challenges of accessing routine dental care have critically impacted the health and success of Florida communities,\" but Rick Scott doesn't care.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "author": "Rmuse", "og": {"site_name": "Politicus USA", "description": "\"Challenges of accessing routine dental care have critically impacted the health and success of Florida communities,\" but Rick Scott doesn't care.", "title": "Rick Scott Vetoes Unanimously Passed GOP Bill That Helps the Poor", "url": "http://www.politicususa.com/2016/04/20/rick-scott-vetoes-unanimously-passed-gop-bill-helps-poor.html", "image": "http://15130-presscdn-0-89.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/scott-rick-close-up.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-04-20T10:00:37+00:00", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 523732690, "app_id": 113462415332922, "pages": 186473214703370}, "keywords": "Commentary,Featured News,Issues,Florida HB 139,Florida Republicans,governor-rick-scott,Scott Vetoes unanimous bill,politicususa,liberal,politics,sarah jones,jason easley,barack obama,hillary clinton,bernie sanders,msnbc,media", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/PoliticusUSA", "section": "Issues", "published_time": "2016-04-20T10:00:37+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-20T10:00:37+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Florida HB 139, Florida Republicans, governor-rick-scott, Scott Vetoes unanimous bill"}, "article_summary": "Governor Rick Scott must have it in for poor and low-income Floridians, particularly those in need of access to any kind of healthcare.\nHowever, as unbelievable as it may seem, and it is unbelievable, one Republican state\u2019s legislature voted unanimously to extend healthcare to help rural and poor Floridians.\nOne hardly ever hears about any legislature unanimously passing anything, much less a Republican-majority legislature passing a bill to help the poor and underserved.\nIn this latest Republican atrocity it was a one-man effort that went against the unanimous wishes of the Republican majority legislature.\nYou\u2019re an embarrassment to our state.\u201dRick Scott is an embarrassment to America, and humanity for that matter."}
