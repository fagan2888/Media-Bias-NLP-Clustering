The rule requires each U.S. state to cut its greenhouse gas emissions to achieve a nationwide reduction of 30 percent by a target date of 2030.\n\nWith less than 18 months left in Obama's presidency, a legal loss would blow a hole in his hopes of leaving a significant legacy on tackling climate change.\n\nOpponents, mainly Republican-leaning states and the coal industry, say the rule will cost hundreds of billions of dollars and lead to a spike in electricity prices. They view it as part of an Obama \"war on coal,\" which disproportionately affects coal-producing states like West Virginia.\n\nAt the core of their legal challenge will be the argument that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) does not have such broad authority to influence the economically crucial area of energy policy.\n\nThe challengers will argue that the government agency has exceeded its legal authority, in part by allowing states to meet their targets not only through limiting power plant emissions but via additional measures such as promoting renewable energy.\n\nIn its June 25 ruling in the healthcare case, called King v. Burwell, the court rejected a conservative challenge to the 2010 Affordable Care Act on a 6-3 vote.\n\nEven though the government won, Chief Justice John Roberts included language in his majority opinion that could help challengers to government regulations. He stressed that when a case is of \"deep economic and political significance\" the court will depart from its usual practice of giving considerable weight to an agency's interpretation.\n\n\"LITIGATED TO DEATH\"\n\nCourts ruling on the Clean Power Plan should adopt the same approach as Roberts did in the healthcare case and decline to defer to the agency, the lawyers are expected to say. If courts endorse the argument that the EPA does not merit deference, the government would lose one of its best legal defenses.\n\n\"That's an issue that will be litigated to death\" by lawyers on both sides, said Theodore Hadzi-Antich, a lawyer with the Pacific Legal Foundation, a conservative legal group likely to support the legal challenge.\n\nThe Clean Air Act, the law that gives EPA authority to issue air pollution regulations, was originally enacted in 1970 when lawmakers did not envision it would be used to tackle greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nVocal opponents of the new regulation, including states like West Virginia and Texas and coal companies, including Murray Energy Corp [MUYEY.UL], have indicated they will file suit as soon as it is officially announced.\n\nLawyers, some set to represent states and industry groups challenging the rule and others with environmental groups likely to support the government, differ over how much influence the Obamacare case will have.\n\nKing v. Burwell doesn't by itself doom the rule, but one industry lawyer set to be involved said it constitutes \"the next logical step\" following recent rulings in which the high court has cast a skeptical eye on major regulatory actions.\n\nThe challengers are also likely to question whether the EPA is even due the usual deference that it gets as the \"expert agency\" considering the broad implications of the regulation.\n\nIndustry lawyers say the EPA is moving beyond its role as an environmental regulator and is instead seeking to direct energy production and distribution. In the healthcare case, the court found that the Internal Revenue Service, which had issued regulations implementing Obamacare insurance subsidies, did not deserve deference because it is not the \"expert agency\" when it comes to health insurance policy.\n\nLawyers representing environmental groups expected to help defend the EPA downplay the Obamacare case's significance.\n\nThey say that, unlike the IRS's role in the Obamacare case, Congress clearly intended the EPA to have considerable leeway in implementing the Clean Air Act.\n\nAn EPA spokeswoman said the agency is confident it has the legal authority to issue the rule, based in part on other recent Supreme Court rulings.\n\nIn those cases, including one that came out just days after King v. Burwell, the court has continued to use the same legal methodology in which the court defers to agency expertise. The court first adopted that approach in an environmental case decided in 1984.\n\nAs such, the Obamacare case is \"very unlikely to significantly influence the outcome of the Clean Power Plan one way or the other,\" said Sean Donahue, a lawyer who represents environmental groups.\n\n(This version of the story corrects the agency name to Internal Revenue Service, not Inland Revenue Service, in paragraph 18.)\n\n(Reporting by Lawrence Hurley.
