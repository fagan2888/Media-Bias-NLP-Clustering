Sioux Falls, SD

Brian Duensing, Brian Dozier, Jack Morris, and Dick Bremer all headlined the annual Twins Winter Caravan in Sioux Falls this year.

With pitchers and catchers set to report in just over a month, the Twins Caravan hit the road last Monday, and will stop in 40 towns in ten days. Tonight, past and present players talked to over 700 fans at the Elmen Center and the players know loved every minute of it.

"It's important for us. After four losing seasons we have to do what we can to keep the fans happy. It is fun going to all of these stops along the way. We stop in a lot of small towns and we have big events like this in Sioux Falls. It is fun to meet the fans," Twins Pitcher Brian Duensing said.

"I think what is even more special is the fact that we have had a rough couple of years and people are still excited about the game," Twins Second Basemen Brian Dozier said.

Because of their rough four year stretch the Twins were forced to get rid of long time Skipper Ron Gardenhire. That opened the door for Hall of Famer and former Twin Paul Molitor to take over as the Manager in his home state.

"He will probably be a little more serious to begin with. He is very into details. He understands and follows all of the small things very closely," Former Twins Pitcher Jack Morris said.

"He is probably the most knowledgeable man about the game of baseball I have ever been around in my life. He brings so much to the table that people don't even realize. He knows the little things and the ins and the outs of the game. I think that is what made him not only one of the best players of his generation, but to ever play the game," Dozier said.

Manager wasn't the only splash the Twins made this offseason in an effort to turn their franchise around. They also signed fan favorite Torii Hunter and improved their pitching staff by bringing in Ervin Santana.

"We are doing what we can to try and get better. Obviously four losing seasons, we are ready to win and we want to win now. I think the fans what that and deserve that," Duensing said.

"There are a lot of bright things coming this year, I can promise you that," Dozier said.

Tomorrow the Twins Caravan will travel across Southern Minnesota with stops in Worthington, Windom, Sleepy Eye, and Mankato.
