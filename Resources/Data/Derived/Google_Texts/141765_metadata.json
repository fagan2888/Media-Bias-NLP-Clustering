Matt Damon plays a stranded astronaut who figures out how to get stuff done \u2014 grow food, make water, phone home and survive long enough for a rescue mission to reach him.\n\nIn Washington, unlike on Mars as told by Hollywood, no one person gets much done \u2014 a lesson driven home hard last week for Sen. Ted Cruz.\n\nCruz\u2019s capacity to irk and alienate Senate colleagues is enormous. So is the pushback, which is why fellow lawmakers and their aides were describing him last week as isolated, quarantined, outfoxed and shunned.\n\nHis popularity within the clubby U.S. Senate, already not great, dropped to new lows. Even the friction between Cruz and Sen. John Cornyn \u2014 usually shielded from public view by both Texas Republicans \u2014 bubbled over.\n\n\u201cI would say the jury is out,\u201d Cornyn responded when asked whether Cruz has lost the ability to effectively represent Texas in the Senate, less than three years on the job. \u201cRelationships are important in life and in politics. That\u2019s a concern I have, is damaging those relationships perhaps on a long-term or permanent basis.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s about as tough as Cornyn gets when it comes to Cruz, who has publicly called Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell a liar and accused him and other GOP leaders \u2014 including Cornyn, McConnell\u2019s deputy \u2014 of weakness and capitulation.\n\nSuch allegations are central to Cruz\u2019s positioning in the 2016 presidential field as an outsider willing and able to shake up Washington. Willing is indisputable. Able is up for debate.\n\nThe most recent dust-up involved funding for abortion provider Planned Parenthood. McConnell and House Speaker John Boehner resisted demands from Cruz and House tea party allies to force a budget showdown that could have triggered a government shutdown. A presidential veto would be inevitable, and Republicans wouldn\u2019t have enough votes to overcome it. So, GOP leaders wanted to avert a politically and economically damaging rerun of the shutdown Cruz instigated two years ago over Obamacare.\n\nCruz\u2019s isolation in the Senate came to a head Monday night, when he sought a vote on a measure to cut funding for Planned Parenthood and the Iran nuclear deal. The proposal was doomed, but Cruz wanted a show vote anyway. Cornyn and McConnell swatted him down hard, blocking his routine request with what Cruz labeled an \u201cunprecedented procedural trick.\u201d\n\nHe called out Cornyn by name \u2014 a rarity \u2014 as he vented frustration during an extraordinary hourlong indictment of fellow Republicans on the Senate floor.\n\nAs the week wore on, he asserted that McConnell sees conservatives as \u201cthe enemy\u201d and would rather stifle them than tussle with Democrats.\n\n\u201cRepublican leaders begin every discussion with a peremptory surrender,\u201d Cruz told a Boston talk radio host Thursday night ahead of a two-day campaign swing in New Hampshire. \u201cWhat we need is Republican leadership that isn\u2019t scared of their own shadow, that doesn\u2019t run screaming from Barack Obama every time he stands up to them.\u201d\n\nCruz loyalist Amanda Carpenter mocked McConnell for denying Cruz \u201ca simple protest vote,\u201d then crowing about it.\n\n\u201cThe fact this is supposed to be some great symbol of might and strength is laughable,\u201d she wrote in Conservative Review, calling McConnell \u201cmyopically focused on his own diminishing power, at the expense of the party. It\u2019s clear he\u2019s devoted more time to shutting down Ted Cruz than any government program.\u201d\n\nSen. Rand Paul, a 2016 rival and fellow tea partier, said the episode showed that Cruz is \u201cpretty much done for and stifled\u201d in the Senate and has only himself to blame. Unlike Cruz, Paul has cultivated a working relationship with McConnell, a fellow Kentuckian.\n\nCalling people liars in public can tend to alienate them, he noted.\n\nAcross the Senate, lawmakers and aides dismissed the grumblings and attacks as self-aggrandizement from someone who puts ambition ahead of a focus on achieving results within the system \u2014 an astronaut marooned on an inhospitable planet who ignores tools within his reach.\n\nFollow Washington Bureau Chief Todd J.
