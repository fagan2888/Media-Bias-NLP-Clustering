Several schools in and around the Wichita-area were in session on this Martin Luther King, Jr. Day.

"With the kids here, I'm taking it as a teachable moment," said Mike Skaggs, history teacher at Bishop Carroll Catholic High School.

Bishop Carroll along with Clearwater Schools (USD 264) and Renwick Schools (USD 267) chose to have classes on this holiday.

"We use it as a day to teach our students the significance in honor of the day and the importance of the work that the veterans and Martin Luther King did for our country," said Leticia Nielsen, president of Bishop Carroll.

Nielsen said she chose to leave the school open today because they took the day off for the Feast of the Immaculate Conception on December 9th. In addition, the high school remained open for Veterans Day on November 11th.

Maize (USD 266) students did not have school but staff had a Professional Development Day.
