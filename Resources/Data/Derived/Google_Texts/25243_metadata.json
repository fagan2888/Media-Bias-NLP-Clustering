Nor are they in front-line combat brigades mobilized to engage in direct heavy combat.\n\nIn the infantry, virtually all of Israel\u2019s female combat soldiers are confined to two light battalions \u2014 the Caracal and the Lions of Jordan \u2014 which are assigned to guard the borders with Egypt and Jordan, the only Arab countries that have peace treaties with Israel.\n\n\u201cUniformed Israeli women patrol the borders or help to train men for combat positions, but these important missions do not involve direct ground combat, meaning deliberate offensive action against the enemy,\u201d said Elaine Donnelly, who heads the Center for Military Readiness. \u201cNone of America\u2019s allies, much less potential adversaries, are treating women like men in the combat arms.\u201d\n\nIsraeli women\u2019s assignments are far more restrictive than the roles envisioned by advocates in the United States who anticipate an American military that opens all ground combat units to women, be they Navy SEALs or Army Green Berets or the Marine infantry or Army Brigade Combat Teams. All are deployed to engage in tough, close-in fighting for hours and days at a time.\n\nDefense Secretary Ashton Carter will make decisions by Jan. 1 and already has said most, if not all, units will be opened.\n\nU.S. advocates also want women assigned to armor units, operating M1A1 main battle tanks.\n\nHere, too, Israel has taken a different route. The Israeli Ynet news service last week reported that the IDF studied the suggestion of women in tanks and rejected the idea based on physical shortcomings compared with men. Ynet also said the study found as problematic putting men and women in the intimate close quarters of a tank for days at a time.\n\nYnet quoted a defense official as saying, \u201cIntegrating female soldiers into tanks was harmful.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe decision not to assign Israeli women to armored tanks in the IDF is based on reality, not myths that often surround these discussions,\u201d Mrs. Donnelly said.\n\nThe Times of Israel said the IDF provided a statement that read, in part, that the \u201cpossibility of opening additional combat positions to girls is being tested all the time.\u201d As of today, \u201cinfantry and the armored corps were ruled out for women.\u201d\n\nDefending the border\n\nThe Times of Israel reported that the army announced a plan in October to train women as tank commanders, with men serving as drivers, loaders and gunners.\n\nWith that plan canceled, the IDF now wants to increase the number of women in units already opened to them \u2014 fighter pilots, field intelligence, artillery and the two co-ed border patrol battalions.\n\nThe IDF opened the Lions of Jordan to women in November. Caracal was stood up 10 years ago.\n\nThe IDF also allows women in certain special operations positions, as does U.S. Special Operations Command, which deploys women in support roles. The IDF assigns women to the special forces K-9 unit known as Oketz.\n\nIsrael is the only country that requires mandatory military service for women, who make up about one-third of the IDF\u2019s 175,000 active force compared with about 14 percent in the U.S. The IDF says more than 90 percent of its jobs are open to women.\n\nThe IDF\u2019s public relations arm promotes the two mixed-gender units as crucial to the defense of Israel, which faces constant threats, particularly from the Palestinian militant group Hamas in the south and the Lebanese extremist group Hezbollah in the north.\n\nThe Caracal\u2019s role has risen in importance in Egypt\u2019s Sinai Peninsula because of increased threats in North Africa from Islamic terrorist groups that have attacked and killed Egyptian troops on that side of the border.\n\nThe IDF noted that the battalion came under fire in October. \u201cWe must provide a fast and strong response against the enemy,\u201d said Gen. Roy Alkabetz. \u201cThe battalion stands by these standards.\u201d\n\nIn September 2012, the Caracal Battalion engaged in a firefight with terrorists at the Sinai border who were attacking IDF soldiers.\n\n\u201cAmong the soldiers in this Caracal force was a markswoman who rushed forward and struck one of the terrorists,\u201d the IDF said. \u201cHer actions resulted in the deaths of two of the three terrorists and the explosion of the explosive belt that one of the terrorists was wearing.\u201d\n\n\u2018A grave mistake\u2019\n\nThe U.S. mainstream media also have singled out the Caracal.\n\n\u201cIsrael holds out the Caracal as proof that women can be all that they can be in the military,\u201d NPR reported in 2013. \u201cThe Israel Defense Forces say that today, nearly 50 percent of Israel\u2019s lieutenants and captains are women.\u201d\n\nThe IDF this month also promoted the news of its first transgender officer, identified on an IDF blog site as \u201cLt. Shachar.\u201d\n\n\u201cHis story of acceptance, patience and honesty is an inspiration to other transgender soldiers in the IDF and to anyone who believes that diversity and equality is possible anytime and anywhere, even in the military,\u201d the blog said.\n\nThere is dissent within the IDF, as the tank decision shows, on how far the feminine line should be moved.\n\nRetired Maj. Gen. Yiftach Ron-Tal is one of the IDF\u2019s most prominent figures. He was top commander of all IDF land forces in 2006.\n\nHe supported moving women into direct land combat but in 2011 announced a change of heart, based partly on increased injury rates.\n\n\u201cIt turns out that the amount of stress fractures suffered by soldiers is dozens of percentage points higher among women than among men. As a result, the female soldiers are not required to carry as much weight,\u201d he told Voice of Israel, according to IsraelNationalNews.com, a product of the Arutz Sheva media outlet.\n\n\u201cI think that women\u2019s service in combat roles in the IDF should not be widened,\u201d he said. \u201cI cannot even imagine a female soldier serving inside a tank or in elite infantry units, mostly because of operational considerations. The army must not allow this thing to interfere with its operational ability.\u201d\n\nGen. Ron-Tal added: \u201cExpanding female service will be a grave mistake that will damage the prowess of the army.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Military traditionalists say women's combat roles in the Israel Defense Forces are exaggerated by advocates in the U.S., noting as an example a recent IDF decision to keep Israeli women from serving on main battle tanks.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Military traditionalists say women\u2019s combat roles in the Israel Defense Forces are exaggerated by advocates in the U.S., noting as an example a recent IDF decision to keep Israeli women from serving on main battle tanks.", "title": "Women\u2019s combat roles in Israel Defense Forces exaggerated, military traditionalists say", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/may/25/womens-combat-roles-in-israel-defense-forces-exagg/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/05/25/5_252015_ap434388333809-08201.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/05/25/5_252015_ap434388333809-08201.jpg", "description": "Military traditionalists say women's combat roles in the Israel Defense Forces are exaggerated by advocates in the U.S., noting as an example a recent IDF decision to keep Israeli women from serving o", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Women\u2019s combat roles in Israel Defense Forces exaggerated, milit"}, "Author": "Rowan Scarborough", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Politics, War Conflict, Israel Defense Forces, Israel, Army"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf2de\"", "article_summary": "Military traditionalists say women\u2019s combat roles in the Israel Defense Forces are exaggerated by advocates in the U.S., noting as an example a recent IDF decision to keep Israeli women from serving on main battle tanks.\nBut a closer look shows Israeli women are not in direct combat special operations such as the Green Berets.\n\u201cThe battalion stands by these standards.\u201dIn September 2012, the Caracal Battalion engaged in a firefight with terrorists at the Sinai border who were attacking IDF soldiers.\n\u201cI think that women\u2019s service in combat roles in the IDF should not be widened,\u201d he said.\nThe IDF also allows women in certain special operations positions, as does U.S. Special Operations Command, which deploys women in support roles."}
