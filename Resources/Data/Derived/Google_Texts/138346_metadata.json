A new study by Columbia University\u2019s Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory issued Thursday warns that global warming caused by industrial greenhouse gases may have intensified California\u2019s drought by 15 to 20 percent, The New York Times reported.\n\nBecause of a diminished snowpack, scant rain and brutal high temperatures, ground water for agriculture irrigation is evaporating or being pumped dry, and surface areas in parts of northern California are beginning to give way.\n\nRelated: Crews Begin to Gain Ground Against Northern California Wildfire\n\nIndeed, although the phenomenon of sinking land \u2013 or \u201csubsidence\u201d as it is called by scientists -- is nothing new to California, NASA analysts determined that parts of the populous state are collapsing at a rate of as much as two inches per month \u2013 faster than in the past.\n\nMark Cowin, the director of the California Department of Water Resources, said in a press release earlier this week that as intensive pumping of groundwater persists, the land is sinking more rapidly \u201cand puts nearby infrastructure at greater risk of costly damage.\u201d\n\nAccording to one study by the University of California, Davis, the drought may cost the California economy roughly $2.7 billion this year \u2013 with most damage to agriculture.\n\nThe San Joaquin Valley is located south of Sacramento, with a sprawling land mass of 22,500 square miles and a total population of about 3.9 million people.\n\nRelated: Drought Costing California Farms $1.8 Billion in Revenue\n\nWhile there is little chance that buildings and homes in Sacramento and other populous areas will be swallowed up, one notable area of concern is centered near Corcoran \u2013 population 24,000 and best known as the location of the California State Prison where Charles Manson is imprisoned.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "It\u2019s bad enough that California is being battered by one of its worst droughts on reco", "title": "California\u2019s Latest Nightmare: San Joaquin Valley is Sinking", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/08/21/California-s-Latest-Nightmare-San-Joaquin-Valley-Sinking", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/08212015_California_Drought.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/08/21/California-s-Latest-Nightmare-San-Joaquin-Valley-Sinking", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/08212015_California_Drought.jpg", "creator": "@ericpianin", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "It\u2019s bad enough that California is being battered by one of its worst droughts on reco", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Related: California Steaming: High Cost of the State's Drought FixesAs the result of a bizarre and tragic confluence of drought, earthquakes, ground water mismanagement and overpopulation, a vast segment of the San Joaquin Valley in northern California is literally sinking into the ground.\nNow comes a report that huge chunks of the state are literally sinking into the ground \u2013 posing serious threats to homes, businesses and roads in the affected areas.\nThe San Joaquin Valley is located south of Sacramento, with a sprawling land mass of 22,500 square miles and a total population of about 3.9 million people.\nAreas of the state are literally turning into giant sinkholes.\nThe geological crisis \u2013 a fit subject for a wild science fiction thriller and one more crisis for Democratic Gov."}
