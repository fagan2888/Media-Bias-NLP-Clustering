But what if you can\u2019t find one with time to see you? That\u2019s the crisis looming in Wyandotte County, where the number of primary care doctors per person is less than half that of Johnson County. In this installment of our series Crossing To Health, KCUR\u2019s Alex Smith looks at how to get more primary care in the area, particularly as demand ramps up.\n\nOn a Sunday morning, New Bethel Church in Kansas City, Kansas, comes alive with the sounds of worship as a full gospel choir and band bring hundreds of congregants to their feet.\n\nAt the center of the action, guitarist Clarence Taylor sits with his eyes lowered, strumming angelic-sounding chords. Taylor has a sound that would put a lot of hot-shot guitarists to shame, but he doesn\u2019t claim the talent for himself. He says it\u2019s a divine gift.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know the notes,\u201d Taylor says. \u201cI can just pick it up. Sometimes it amazes me.\u201d\n\nThe 61-year-old owns a janitorial business, and his income can be unpredictable. For years, instead of buying health insurance and seeing a regular doctor, Taylor paid for health care out of pocket when emergencies arose.\n\nBut with the help of the church\u2019s community health director, Broderick Crawford, Taylor was able to get subsidies and insurance and connect with primary care doctors and nurses to treat his diabetes and heart issues.\n\n\u201cGod has hooked me up with the right people,\u201d Taylor says. \u201cSo I\u2019m glad.\u201d\n\nThe \u2018right people\u2019 can be hard to find in Wyandotte County. In the past couple of years, the Affordable Care Act has provided thousands of residents here with health insurance, creating a surge in demand for health care in a county that had already been designated a Health Professional Shortage Area by the federal government.\n\nWyandotte County has just half the number of active primary care doctors per person that Johnson County has, even though it\u2019s the home to the University of Kansas Hospital and the University of Kansas Medical School.\n\nThe heightened demand won\u2019t suffice to lure more physicians. Rather, the future of the county\u2019s health workforce is more likely to be shaped by the decisions of those very fresh-faced medical students at KU Med about to embark on their careers.\n\nChoosing a future\n\nOn a Monday evening at the JayDoc Free Clinic in Kansas City, Kansas, second-year students are learning some of the basics of family medicine. They perform routine physicals, treat pain and, with the guidance of a supervising physician, address other health issues that patients report.\n\nIt\u2019s an eye-opening experience for Adam McCann, one that will help inform a decision he\u2019ll have to make soon: what kind of doctor he wants to become.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s definitely something that\u2019s on our minds from Day One,\u201d McCann says. \u201cIt\u2019s just trying to delay the big decision until later.\u201d\n\nFamily and internal medicine pay an average of about $190,000 a year. That\u2019s a great living by most standards, but it\u2019s at the bottom of the pay scale for doctors. Specialists in orthopedics or cardiology typically make twice as much.\n\nAnd as students like Hailey Baker consider a debt load that averages about $180,000, the pay difference is hard to ignore.\n\n\u201cThat is something I think about, because it is just insane how in debt I\u2019m going to be,\u201d Baker says.\n\nOnce students like McCann and Baker become doctors, money will likely play a big part in where they choose to work.\n\nPrivate insurance pays doctors much more for treating patients than Medicaid or Medicare. With plenty of privately-insured residents, Johnson County almost guarantees a good salary. Not so in Wyandotte County, where there are far fewer privately-insured patients.\n\nAnd that situation will probably only get worse as politicians and insurers try to rein in spiraling health care costs.\n\nStudent Maddy Breedan says that adds another element of uncertainty when it comes to choosing a career.\n\n\u201cIt is a little bit worrisome sometimes, just with things changing so rapidly and kind of not knowing what the direction is,\u201d Breedan says.\n\nTo lure more primary care doctors to Wyandotte County and other areas deemed medically needy, Kansas and the federal government have adopted loan forgiveness programs. And while these programs have attracted some doctors, the overall problem in Wyandotte County remains stubbornly the same.\n\nHigher calling\n\nThe solution, according to Professor Erin Fraher of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, may be to appeal more to the heart.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just about reimbursement,\u201d Fraher says. \u201cIt\u2019s about the quality of practice. It\u2019s about the joy in practice.\u201d\n\nFraher says medical schools need to get students out of the classroom and hospital and working in communities like Wyandotte County as early as possible. Doctors can be inspired to a higher calling if there\u2019re exposed to it before financial incentives take hold.\n\n\u201cWhen they put their students out into these underserved communities, medical students become excited about serving these patients,\u201d Fraher says. \u201cWe know then that they can pursue a residency in a community where there\u2019s greater need.\u201d\n\nSounds good in theory. But even for doctors who have a passion for it, the work isn\u2019t easy.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a really tough way to make a living,\u201d says Dr. Sharon Lee, who founded the Family Care Clinic in Kansas City, Kansas, more than 25 years ago.\n\nMany of the patients Lee sees have complicated health issues and even messier lives characterized by poverty, unremitting work demands, lack of transportation, and emotional issues, among other problems.\n\nIt\u2019s common for patients to simply fall off the radar.\n\n\u201cIt feels very much like failure,\u201d Lee says. \u201cIt\u2019s hard when you have a person that you believe you have some way of helping and then they don\u2019t follow through. It\u2019s hard.\u201d\n\nMore than two-thirds of doctors who chose family medicine say they wouldn\u2019t do it again, according to surveys conducted by the physician news source Medscape.\n\nTo support the work of primary care doctors, Fraher says communities need people to look after patients after they leave the doctor\u2019s office.\n\n\u201cYou need to build a team around them,\u201d she says. \u201cYou need social workers. You need community health workers to help translate what the physician says to the patient and help them be adherent.\u201d\n\nIn fact, community health workers \u2013 often non-professionals who help coordinate care in their own communities \u2013 have become more common in Wyandotte County in recent years.\n\nEl Centro, for example, began enlisting volunteers in its Promotoras de Salud program in 2009 to provide outreach for Spanish-speaking residents.\n\nAnd new grant funding, like last year\u2019s award of $1.6 million to the Community Health Council of Wyandotte County from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, supports the creation of more of these workers.\n\nEven so, the data suggest the mismatch between available doctors and patients is getting worse.\n\nWyandotte County\u2019s ratio of primary care doctors to residents has actually gotten worse. Meanwhile, Johnson County\u2019s has gotten better.\n\nSo even though Wyandotte County\u2019s uninsured rate is falling and the county is providing more to help the newly-insured, many residents will likely have an even harder time finding basic health care.\n\nClarence Taylor, the guitarist who received assistance through his church, says he can understand why that would leave residents feeling somewhat desperate. He remembers the sensation well.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s when you really start praying,\u201d he says. \u201cSaying, \u2018God, you\u2019re gonna have to help me, cause I don\u2019t know who to talk to.\u2019\u201d\n\nThis article was produced as a project for the Dennis A.
