They are leaving Medicare, not participating in it,\u201d said Dr. John Vitarello, of Cardiovascular Specialists of Frederick. \u201cAnd the patients are left on the lurch, without a physician to take care of them.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday night, more than 100 physicians in the Frederick area gathered together to hear from the regional head of Medicare, Dr. Barbara Connors, about what the new program will mean for them. The law will go into effect in 2019.\n\n\u201cCMS (Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services) has many more rules that we have to abide by in caring for patients, yet they\u2019re looking to pay us less and less,\u201d said Carole Grissom, executive director of Glade Valley Center in Frederick.\n\nMichael Rifkin, a former gastroenterologist in Frederick who was in attendance, even left his practice two years ago because of increased regulations, which he said got in the way of providing good care.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to get better, I think it\u2019s going to get worse,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I think you\u2019re going to see worsening of patient care, unfortunately.\u201d\n\nDr. Vitarello also said the Affordable Care Act has brought in more patients that otherwise wouldn\u2019t see a doctor. However, he explained that it has had unintended consequences, such as spreading an already low amount of doctors too thin.\n\n\u201cWho\u2019s going to be there to take care of us? What\u2019s the quality of care going to be like when we\u2019re senior citizens?\u201d Rifkin added. \u201cEverybody\u2019s afraid.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a perfect storm in the next couple of years when we break the system in 2025,\u201d Dr. Vitarello said. \u201cWe\u2019ll be 90,000 doctors short, and 60 new million Medicare patients, baby boomers. It\u2019s a doomsday scenario.\u201d\n\nDr. Vitarello said that fellow physicians will have until June 20 to submit their comments and feedback to Andew Slavitt, the acting adminstrator of CMS.", "article_metadata": {"description": "As a new model of Medicare looms on the horizon, doctors in the United States have a problem on their hands \u2013 their own numbers are shrinking, while the number of elderly patients is only going up.", "author": "NICK MUNSON", "og": {"site_name": "YOUR4STATE", "description": "As a new model of Medicare looms on the horizon, doctors in the United States have a problem on their hands \u2013 their own numbers are shrinking, while the number of elderly patients is only going up.", "title": "Frederick-area doctors give feedback on new Medicare model", "url": "http://www.your4state.com/news/i-270/frederick-area-doctors-give-feedback-on-new-medicare-model", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://static.lakana.com/nxsglobal/feedsite/photo/2016/05/25/Frederick%20Medicare%20Mtg%202_8721505_ver1.0_640_360.jpg", "height": 360}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1604669783137304}, "google-site-verification": "SrP48pfz65vFAYhG6Jd9I0FLKnOsN-YikqAc8r7TguE", "keywords": "frederick,medicare,health,baby_boomers,hospitals,patients,I-270,Local News,News", "article": {"section": "I-270", "tag": "health, frederick, patients, medicare, baby_boomers, hospitals", "published_time": "2016-05-26T04:20:32+0000", "modified_time": "2016-05-26T04:20:32+0000"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "\u201cWe\u2019ll be 90,000 doctors short, and 60 new million Medicare patients, baby boomers.\n\u201cEverybody\u2019s afraid.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a perfect storm in the next couple of years when we break the system in 2025,\u201d Dr. Vitarello said.\nThey are leaving Medicare, not participating in it,\u201d said Dr. John Vitarello, of Cardiovascular Specialists of Frederick.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to get better, I think it\u2019s going to get worse,\u201d he said.\nWhat\u2019s the quality of care going to be like when we\u2019re senior citizens?\u201d Rifkin added."}
