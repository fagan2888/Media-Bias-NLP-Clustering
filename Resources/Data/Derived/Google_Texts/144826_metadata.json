We would fill up before noon sometimes or not have as much availability,\u201d Wilkins said. \u201cPeople were coming in that afternoon and we would have to tell them you have to come back tomorrow or set up an appointment. It was frustrating, so having these additional hours will be helpful.\u201d\n\nA good portion of the patients coming to the clinic are low-income, have unreliable transportation or have children in school \u2013 three factors that put stresses on families that are sometimes forced to choose between health care, work and family.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s nice to have later times because, depending on when people work, they can come in a little bit later and not have to miss work,\u201d Wilkins said. \u201cFor some people, that can cause work instability, so that is a big factor for a lot of my patients. I don\u2019t want people losing their jobs because they need health care.\u201d\n\nWith the additional hours, the clinic \u2013 one of just 1,200 federally qualified health centers in the U.S. \u2013 is working to remarket itself as more than \u201ca last resort,\u201d said Dr. Howard Ehrman, chief medical officer for the clinic.\n\n\u201cA lot of people see [federally qualified health centers] like us historically as the clinic of last resort as opposed to we\u2019re here because we give really good, quality care that\u2019s more accessible than people realize,\u201d Ehrman said.\n\nThe clinic is achieving this by adding more physicians into the walk-in rotation schedule, he said.\n\nThe number of uninsured patients at the clinic has declined with the creation of the Affordable Care Act, said Mary Maragos, the center\u2019s chief executive officer.\n\n\u201cI think what it really translates to is people are able to get the care that they\u2019ve been needing instead of putting it off,\u201d Maragos said.\n\nIn 2013, a little more than half of the clinic\u2019s patients were uninsured. Now, just 27.5 percent remain uninsured. About 61.7 percent are enrolled through Medicaid this year, compared to 42.2 percent in 2013, according to Maragos.", "article_metadata": {"copyright": "2016 The Herald-News", "og": {"url": "http://www.theherald-news.com/2015/06/17/will-county-community-health-center-expands-walk-in-clinic-hours/agpszcj/", "image": "http://www.theherald-news.com/_internal/cimg!0/4zj6pbb460eoztuptgp3g4xy4g1ov5x", "site_name": "The Herald-News", "description": "JOLIET \u2013 As part of a growing trend nationwide, the Will County Community Health Center is joining other walk-in clinics that cater to people with hectic schedules and a desire for quick and easy health care access.", "title": "Will County Community Health Center expands walk-in clinic hours"}, "twitter": {"site": "@Joliet_HN", "image": "http://www.theherald-news.com/_internal/cimg!0/4zj6pbb460eoztuptgp3g4xy4g1ov5x", "description": "JOLIET \u2013 As part of a growing trend nationwide, the Will County Community Health Center is joining other walk-in clinics that cater to people with hectic schedules and a desire for quick and easy health care access.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Will County Community Health Center expands walk-in clinic hours"}, "robots": "All", "revisit-after": "1 Days", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1092756832", "fb": {"pages": 255829231119332}, "tout": {"article": {"id": "8a313e81-9f64-4ebd-a6ab-468324d4c995"}}, "keywords": "#Health, will county community center", "distribution": "Global", "viewport": "width=device-width, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "This week, the clinic expanded its walk-in hours \u2013 now staying open two additional hours until 6 p.m. Monday through Thursday.\nJOLIET \u2013 As part of a growing trend nationwide, the Will County Community Health Center is joining other walk-in clinics that cater to people with hectic schedules and a desire for quick and easy health care access.\n\u201cIt\u2019s nice to have later times because, depending on when people work, they can come in a little bit later and not have to miss work,\u201d Wilkins said.\nThe number of uninsured patients at the clinic has declined with the creation of the Affordable Care Act, said Mary Maragos, the center\u2019s chief executive officer.\nThe clinic is achieving this by adding more physicians into the walk-in rotation schedule, he said."}
