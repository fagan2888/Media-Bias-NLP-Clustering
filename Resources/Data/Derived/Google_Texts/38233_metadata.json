The shift could be a factor that could leave Ms. Ashton continuing to play a lead role if needed in nuclear negotiations with Iran. Associated Press\n\nDespite continued talk of progress in Iran\u2019s nuclear negotiations with six major powers, there remains a significant possibility a final deal will not be done by the Nov. 24 deadline, paving the way for an extension of the discussions.\n\nIn Brussels, that is raising a question.\n\nWho will play the role of Catherine Ashton, the outgoing European Union foreign-policy chief who has chaired the six party group and played negotiating partner to Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif? The answer seems to be: Ms. Ashton.\n\nThe British diplomat is due to step down from her Brussels post when a new EU executive takes over on Nov. 1. But the six power group \u2014 the U.S., the U.K., France, Germany, Russia and China \u2014 reached an informal agreement in July when talks were extended, that Ms. Ashton would stay until Nov. 24.\n\nHowever, in recent weeks, as the possibility of a second extension of the talks has loomed, an understanding is forming that Ms. Ashton should stay on to see the job through, according to several people close to the talks.\n\nLegally speaking, the United Nations Security Council handed the job of chairing the so-called P5+1 group, not to any individual, but to the EU\u2019s High Representative for foreign policy. Theoretically that means the role should be taken up from November by Ms. Ashton\u2019s successor in Brussels, current Italian Foreign Minister Federica Mogherini.\n\nMs. Ashton will hold a handover dinner with Ms. Mogherini and other EU foreign ministers on Monday evening in Luxembourg after chairing her final meeting of the bloc\u2019s foreign ministers.\n\nMs. Ashton\u2019s office won\u2019t entertain questions about what happens if the Iran talks are extended beyond Nov. 24. The firm answer comes back: we are working to meet the deadline and won\u2019t engage in hypotheticals about any form of Plan B. (Plan C, some would say since the talks have already been extended once.)\n\nBut privately, officials acknowledge this has been talked through. \u201cThey want Cathy to finish the job \u2013 beyond Nov. 24\u2026 and this is the understanding of the group as far as I can see,\u201d said one person close to the talks. The arguments for keeping Ms. Ashton in place for a while at least are clear. She has organized this process for the last five years and enjoys good ties with most of the Iranians involved. Changing the team captain if an extension is required may ruffle negotiations at the very moment the talks are likely to come under heavy fire from skeptics in Tehran, Washington and elsewhere who argue that diplomacy will yield few results.\n\nThere are counter-arguments. Some believe Ms. Ashton\u2019s role is no longer key. A deal depends fundamentally on agreement between Iran and the U.S. on key issues. In any case, Ms. Ashton\u2019s able deputy Helga Schmid will stay in her role for the next few months. Ms. Schmid, who has been involved in Iran nuclear talks for the best part of the last decade, has a critical relationship with Iran\u2019s Abbas Araghchi, the man who many see as the key player in the Iran team.\n\nThere\u2019s another factor at play here: the wishes of Ms. Ashton and Ms. Mogherini. While the current EU foreign policy chief has made it clear at various points she\u2019s looking forward to going home and enjoying some time off, she has invested a huge amount of time, emotion and determination in the Iran talks\n\nPeople close to her say that even when the talks were seen as a diplomatic dead-end back in 2010 and 2011 under former Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, Ms. Ashton believed she could play an important role in revitalizing the negotiations if given the chance.\n\nIf there is a short extension, Ms. Ashton may be very keen to try and see it through. That may suit Ms. Mogherini, said someone involved in the transition process. While the Iran role would provide her with some top-level experience and international limelight, the Italian foreign minister has set out a different vision of the EU post to Ms. Ashton.\n\nShe has given the impression that she wants to avoid having her schedule absorbed by one or two key negotiating files.\n\nShe has said she wants to focus on reviewing the EU\u2019s foreign-policy process and priorities in her first 100 days and she has been clear that she sees one of her key tasks as integrating the EU\u2019s foreign policy service better with the work of the rest of the European Commission team.\n\nThat means a heavier Brussels-based workload than for Ms. Ashton, who was on the road almost non-stop and rarely attended the weekly commission meetings. Of course, the talks may advance sufficiently to make the issue academic. But don\u2019t rule out a continued Iran role for the foreseeable future for Ms. Ashton.\n\nUPDATE: Ms. Ashton has confirmed the story. \u201cI\u2019ve been asked to stay on until it\u2019s done,\u201d she said when asked her if she may stay beyond Nov 24.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "The question to which Catherine Ashton seems to be the answer.", "title": "EU\u2019s Ashton May Keep Iran Role If Talks Extended Again", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/brussels/2014/10/20/eus-ashton-may-keep-iran-role-if-talks-extended-again/", "image": {"src": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-FB976_Ashton_P_20141020024115.jpg"}, "site": "WSJ", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "World", "article.headline": "EU\u2019s Ashton May Keep Iran Role If Talks Extended Again", "description": "The question to which Catherine Ashton seems to be the answer.", "article_section": "World", "author": "Laurence Norman", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "Real Time Brussels Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "Real Time Brussels", "article.summary": "The question to which Catherine Ashton seems to be the answer.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2014-10-20T07:00:46-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-139", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/brussels/2014/10/20/eus-ashton-may-keep-iran-role-if-talks-extended-again/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-RTBB-4636", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "World", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "The question to which Catherine Ashton seems to be the answer.", "title": "EU\u2019s Ashton May Keep Iran Role If Talks Extended Again", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/brussels/2014/10/20/eus-ashton-may-keep-iran-role-if-talks-extended-again/", "image": {"width": 749, "identifier": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-FB976_Ashton_P_20141020024115.jpg", "height": 499}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Real Time Brussels", "article.id": "BL-RTBB-4636", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2014-10-20T09:54:19-04:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdad09\"", "article_summary": "But don\u2019t rule out a continued Iran role for the foreseeable future for Ms. Ashton.\nMs. Ashton\u2019s office won\u2019t entertain questions about what happens if the Iran talks are extended beyond Nov. 24.\nThere\u2019s another factor at play here: the wishes of Ms. Ashton and Ms. Mogherini.\nThe shift could be a factor that could leave Ms. Ashton continuing to play a lead role if needed in nuclear negotiations with Iran.\nIf there is a short extension, Ms. Ashton may be very keen to try and see it through."}
