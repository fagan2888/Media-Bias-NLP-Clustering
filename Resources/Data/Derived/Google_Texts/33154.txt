ABC's Arlette Saenz and Scott Wilson report:

White House Press Secretary Jay Carney took to the podium on Wednesday for his final briefing after more than three years on the job.

Carney walked into the briefing room as a song by Guided Voices played in the background. "Now, that is some good rock 'n' roll," Carney said.

"This has been an extraordinary experience, and I have loved every minute of every day, even the many minutes of many days I spent in this room," the outgoing press secretary added. "As I think most of you now understand and believe, it's always a pleasure, no matter how hard it can get in here, how hot it can sometimes be and contentious it sometimes is."
