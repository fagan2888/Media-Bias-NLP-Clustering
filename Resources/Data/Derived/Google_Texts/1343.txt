APPLETON, Maine — The driver of one vehicle involved in a head-on crash on Thanksgiving day was flown by a LifeFlight helicopter to a Lewiston hospital.

Richard Shannon, 57, of Appleton, was driving south on Union Road in Appleton when he lost control of his 2006 Jeep and the vehicle crossed the centerline, according to Knox County Sheriff’s Office Chief Deputy Tim Carroll. Shannon’s vehicle struck a 1990 Ford truck that was northbound and driven by Lindsey Ecker, 22, of Rockland.

The impact sent Ecker’s truck down an embankment, causing it to roll over. Lindsey Ecker suffered minor injuries and was taken by Sterling Ambulance to Pen Bay Medical Center in Rockport. Her passenger, Ryan Ecker, 21, of Rockland, also was taken by ambulance to PBMC.

Shannon suffered a serious leg fracture and was flown to Central Maine Medical Center.

The conditions of the three victims were not immediately available Friday.
