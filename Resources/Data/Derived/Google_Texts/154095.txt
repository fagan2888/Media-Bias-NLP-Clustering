Kyle, SD

In a story July 30 about the arrest of a Kyle woman, The Associated Press, relying on information from the U.S. attorney's office, reported erroneously that Jeannie Janis was charged with abusing or neglecting her infant son, causing his death. Assistant U.S. Attorney Sarah Collins said the child was injured, but he did not die.

A South Dakota woman who authorities accuse of causing the death of her five-week old baby has been arrested for an apparent violation of her pretrial release conditions.



Federal court records show Jeannie Janis was arrested and charged with driving while intoxicated in July on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation.



Authorities say her blood alcohol level when she was arrested was .106 even though her pretrial release conditions banned her from consuming alcohol.



The Kyle woman was indicted in February for felony child abuse and neglect. She pleaded not guilty to the charge and was allowed to remain free on a personal recognizance bond.



The indictment charges that Janis abused the boy in June 2014.



Janis's attorney didn't immediately return a call seeking comment on her arrest.
