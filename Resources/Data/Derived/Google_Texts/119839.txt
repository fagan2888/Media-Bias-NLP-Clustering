A Wichita man says he's victim of Christmas crime. He says a man with a gun threatened him over his decorations and because it's not the first time, the incident was caught on camera.

Because of all the lights and inflatable decorations, Michael Green's house is hard to ignore during the holidays but not all of the attention is welcome.

"Almost every year for 13 years there's been some kind of vandalism done to my Christmas decorations,” Michael Green said.

That's why about 10 years ago, he installed security cameras. Sure enough this week, they caught a vandal on camera but green says it's what happened after next that still has him spooked.

"This year was totally different. This year blew my mind,” Green said.

In the security video, you see an older man walking down the sidewalk suddenly start ripping down garland from Green's fence.

"I heard the pulling of staples breaking of wires, breaking of glass just on the other side of the fence,” Green said.

Green runs out his yard and follows the man across the street.

"I thought I was going to yell at the guy and maybe catch him and make him pay for some lights or something,” Green said.

Instead, he says the man turned around and threatened to kill him.

"'Don't follow me, I'll shoot you. I'll shoot you right now,' and that's when he pulled out the gun,” Green said.

In the future, Green says some things will be different. He'll call police first instead of confronting vandals but he says one thing won't ever change. His display of Christmas cheer is here to stay.

"This is for the community, it's for more than just me and yeah, the lights are up to stay,” Green said.
