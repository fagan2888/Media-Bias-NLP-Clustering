Instead of legislating national policy in the interests of a strong national defense, the usual suspects were hard at work on preserving\u2026century-old lighting technology. Good job, guys!\n\nYes, the light bulb ban is once again a priority for certain conservative legislators, who have been working off and on for the past several years to repeal the part of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 that sets new efficiency standards for light bulb manufacturers.\n\nThe new standards effectively mean it\u2019s lights out for conventional incandescent bulbs, which waste 90 percent of their energy in the form of heat.\n\nWaving The Light Bulb Ban Banner\n\nWe\u2019ve been following the light bulb preservationists since the phase-in of the new standards began in 2011. The preservationist movement started out as a loud, long call to arms but it began to lose steam as the phase-in took hold, and when the last deadline passed on January 1 there was barely a whisper in defense of the old bulbs.\n\nWell, it looks like those brave champions of wastefulness were just taking a breather. Our friends over at TheHill.com have alerted us that the light bulb torch has been passed to Rep. Jeff Duncan (R-South Carolina), who has just introduced H.R. 3818 repealing the relevant section of the 2007 energy act.\n\nTo be fair, according to Hill reporter Pete Kasperowicz there doesn\u2019t seem to be much interest in supporting H.R. 3818 beyond Duncan and Rep. Ted Poe (R-Texas), who made an impassioned statement in support of the old bulbs, although it seems he lost his way at some point with a quote from legendary musician Willie Nelson suggesting he has already given up the fight:\n\nAs Willie Nelson has said: \u2018Turn out the lights, the party\u2019s over. They say that all good things must end. Turn out the lights, the party\u2019s over,\u2019 for at least Thomas Edison\u2019s light bulb.\n\nThe Dragnet Perspective On Climate Change\n\nIn contrast, let\u2019s take a look at what the US military is saying about the need for effective action on climate change, through the window of a recent briefing attended by newly minted Senator Cory Booker (D-New Jersey).\n\nWe happened to catch an interview with Senator Booker yesterday on WSOU, the hard rock station that broadcasts out of Seton Hall University, conducted by station manager Erin O\u2019Grady.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen asked by O\u2019Grady to describe the transition from Mayor of Newark to becoming a US Senator, Booker mentioned the briefing and he zeroed in on climate change. This is what he had to say, apparently channeling Joe Friday:\n\n\u2026.as a US Senator you\u2019ve got to be up and on top of military issues\u2026I was amazed at one of them, [who] was telling me, \u2018look, we don\u2019t debate climate change, we just prepare to deal with the facts.\u2019 And if the military is not prepared for rising sea waters, and if the military is not prepared to find alternative fuels and energy so supply chains shouldn\u2019t be getting endangered in a crisis [and don\u2019t] undermine our defense capabilities, then we\u2019re going to be lost. So hearing a general say, \u2018hey look, we\u2019re doing the logical thing based on the facts, from biofuels to finding ways to conserve energy and reduce carbon output,\u2019 that\u2019s to me the kind of practical thinking we should be having all over our society right now. \u2026Let\u2019s just do what the facts compel us to do.\n\nThe above is an unofficial transcript and if you want to check out the SoundCloud audio for yourself it starts at 11:40. Also for the record, Dragnet\u2019s fictional detective Joe Friday did not utter the famous line, \u201cJust the facts, ma\u2019am.\u201d He said, \u201cAll we want are the facts.\u201d\n\nSupport Our Troops!\n\nBooker touched a lot of bases with those brief comments in terms of what the Department of Defense is doing to develop a leaner carbon profile.\n\nWe\u2019d also like to note that portable solar power and other forms of new energy technology are being integrated into forward operating bases and field maneuvers by the US Army and Marine Corps.\n\nIn tandem with new fuels and new technologies, \u201cculture change\u201d and \u201cenergy informed culture\u201d are the kinds of words being used by top-level officials to describe how they expect military personnel to adjust their habits and behavior to get the most out of new energy technologies and help drive down dependency on fossil fuels.\n\nAs for Rep. Sessions and Rep. Poe, let\u2019s give them the benefit of the doubt. Maybe they just didn\u2019t get the memo.\n\nFollow me on Twitter and Google+.\n\nPsst, wanna keep up with all the latest clean tech news from CleanTechnica?
