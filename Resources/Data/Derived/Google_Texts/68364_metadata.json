(AP) - Everything about the 73-year-old Penny Sisto seems a little unreal, maybe unbelievable, or how she described it \u201cmagical.\u201d It might be her home - a log cabin tucked in the woods.\n\nPerhaps it\u2019s her soft Scottish accent that rises and falls like the sea near the island in which she grew up. It might even be the way she finds detailed human faces in scraps of felt and dyed cloth taken from - what else - a hideaway she calls a \u201cmagic drawer.\u201d\n\nSisto, an artist since 7 years old and a Floyds Knobs resident, turns out \u201ca couple hundred\u201d pieces every year and sells them to a local audience. Her work, well - \u201cA: It\u2019s beautiful,\u201d said the Rev. Rick Kautz of St. Paul\u2019s Episcopal Church in New Albany. \u201cIt\u2019s just wonderful work.\u201d\n\nHis church has hosted Sisto\u2019s work a few times in the past two years.\n\nThe working name for Sisto\u2019s art is \u201cquilt,\u201d but her creations are a combination of pastels, dye and cloth. The finished products are realistic masterpieces, often of women, but always alive.\n\nSisto\u2019s creativity was born of a \u201cgrim\u201d early life, where her story seems less like a fantasy novel and more like a Greek tragedy.\n\n\u201cI think because the atmosphere at home was so destructive, I needed to create something beautiful each day,\u201d she told the News and Tribune (http://bit.ly/1HkqPFW ).\n\nSisto\u2019s family had lived on the Orkney Islands in Northern Scotland for hundreds of years when Sisto\u2019s teenage mother gave birth to her and left the area soon afterward. Sisto\u2019s grandmother raised her, but didn\u2019t have much use for another mouth to feed.\n\n\u201cI loved her very much, but she was a very hard woman,\u201d said Sisto.\n\nStill, Sisto said she learned important lessons from her situation.\n\n\u201cI carry a lot of scars, but I would choose it again because it taught me so many beautiful things,\u201d she said. \u201cThe greatest of which was to be totally self-sufficient.\u201d\n\nBeing self-sufficient for Sisto means not going hungry or growing lonely. It means holding witness to everyday miracles.\n\nIn the early 1960s, Sisto, then a well-practiced midwife, traveled to Africa to help Maasai women give birth. From there, she moved to California with her first husband and lived at a \u201ccommune\u201d - the still-standing Ananda Village.\n\n\u201cSo I came here and stayed even though he didn\u2019t,\u201d she said jokingly.\n\nSisto has been with her husband Richard Sisto, a jazz musician, for 35 years. They moved to Kentucky and worked on a dairy farm before moving to her current Indiana residence. By that time, only three of Sisto\u2019s 10 children lived at home.\n\nWhen Sisto arrived in Indiana, her property was nothing, she said. \u201cNothing, but frogs and trees.\u201d\n\nToday, there are still things to be done - Sisto said she is waiting on rain to lay a stone path - but the majority of her home is completed. A backyard teepee even stretches into the sky. Sisto follows a Native American tradition.\n\nHer teepee has hosted the home births of her grandchildren and a parade of interesting animals - birthing does and stoic owls.\n\nAnimals are not the only visitors that find themselves in Sisto\u2019s backyard.\n\n\u201cStrange people come here,\u201d she said.\n\nShe possesses a picture of Adolfo Perez Esquivel, a Nobel Peace Prize winner, standing on her property.\n\n\u201cHe wanted to meet me,\u201d she said proudly.\n\nShe doesn\u2019t know exactly how he heard of her - his wife is an artist, she said. Or maybe the monks who lived near her Kentucky farm told him about the woman in the woods.\n\nWhatever it was, people seem to be drawn in by Sisto.\n\n\u201cPenny herself when she gives a gallery talk, the spirit that comes out of her just exudes joy and life,\u201d said Kautz.\n\nPamela Mattei, a Louisville-based artist who has made a \u201cnational name\u201d for herself in fabric arts, has similar things to say about Sisto, who mentored Mattei during her high school years.\n\nAs a freshman at Presentation Academy, Mattei watched Sisto speak during a Women in Careers Day event. Mattei\u2019s \u201ceyes lit up like a kid on Christmas morning\u201d when she heard a real fabric artist would be talking. When school ended and Mattei returned home, she told her parents what her future held for her.\n\n\u201cI want to be a fabric artist,\u201d she said.\n\nNow, Mattei owns her own business - DyeSigns by Pamela Inc., but she hasn\u2019t forgotten her beginnings.\n\n\u201cNo interview or story about my journey as an artist is complete unless I talk about the impact Penny has had on my career,\u201d she said in an email.\n\nSisto has her limits of course - at least that\u2019s what she says, but she also acknowledges her abilities.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a bad artist, I have no education, I\u2019m a bad sewer \u2026 and yet the one talent I have is to put down in fabric something that makes you able to feel how I felt when I made it,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s magic.\u201d\n\n___\n\nInformation from: News and Tribune, Jeffersonville, Ind., http://www.newsandtribune.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "Everything about the 73-year-old Penny Sisto seems a little unreal, maybe unbelievable, or how she described it \"magical.\" It might be her home - a log cabin tucked in the woods.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jun/16/southern-indiana-artist-enchants-the-public-with-h/", "site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "type": "article", "description": "Everything about the 73-year-old Penny Sisto seems a little unreal, maybe unbelievable, or how she described it \u201cmagical.\u201d It might be her home - a log cabin tucked in the woods.", "title": "Southern Indiana artist enchants the public with her quilts"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "description": "Everything about the 73-year-old Penny Sisto seems a little unreal, maybe unbelievable, or how she described it \"magical.\" It might be her home - a log cabin tucked in the woods.", "card": "summary", "title": "Southern Indiana artist enchants the public with her quilts"}, "Author": "DANIELLE GRADY", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "article_summary": "Mattei\u2019s \u201ceyes lit up like a kid on Christmas morning\u201d when she heard a real fabric artist would be talking.\n\u201cI carry a lot of scars, but I would choose it again because it taught me so many beautiful things,\u201d she said.\n\u201cI want to be a fabric artist,\u201d she said.\nThe working name for Sisto\u2019s art is \u201cquilt,\u201d but her creations are a combination of pastels, dye and cloth.\nAs a freshman at Presentation Academy, Mattei watched Sisto speak during a Women in Careers Day event."}
