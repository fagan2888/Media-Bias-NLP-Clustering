Can and should altruism be combined with making a profit? What does it mean for a few huge foundations, typically controlled by people who\u2019ve made a fortune in business, to be taking on far greater roles in education and health?\n\n\n\nWe may be broadly sympathetic to the goals of, for example, the Gates Foundation and the energy with which \u201cthe saint of Seattle\u201d is pursuing them. But what are we to make of Bill Gates\u2019 fellow billionaires who use their vast wealth to discredit ObamaCare or initiatives to combat climate change \u2013 and even, in one case, to try to abolish death? Is there any way we can hope to control them?\n\n\n\nThose were just some of the questions that came up when I met Linsey McGoey, senior lecturer in sociology at the University of Essex, to discuss her forthcoming book No Such Thing as a Free Gift: The Gates Foundation and the Price of Philanthropy. The highlights of our conversation, where she explained why Gates is such a contentious figure, appear in a feature-length profile in this week\u2019s magazine. But she was also happy to range far more widely about the paradoxes of \u201cphilanthrocapitalism\u201d.\n\n\n\nTake the whole phenomenon of microfinance, once much acclaimed as a spectacular new method for getting credit to those unable to access it before. McGoey accepts that it has provided \u2013 very modest \u2013 benefits to poor borrowers, yet also claims that \u201cthe major beneficiaries have been banks and for-profit institutions, many of whom received a lot of state and philanthropic support\u201d.\n\n\n\nSomething similar applies to \u201cthe private education movement in the US\u201d that McGoey fears may be transferred to the UK.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt has allowed a lot of [hitherto] public space to be opened up to for-profit investment, though primary and secondary education might have been better left out of commodified space,\u201d she explains. Yet although \u201cpeople are getting rich through taxpayer-funded initiatives, the impact for students has not yet proved to justify such a level of public investment\u201d.\n\n\n\nAs always, both the fun and the insights come from \u201cfollowing the money\u201d.\n\nRead Matthew Reisz\u2019s feature from 15 October in our Features section.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Matthew Reisz reflects on the issues raised by\u00a0Linsey McGoey\u2019s new book on \u2018philanthrocapitalism\u2019", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"site_name": "Times Higher Education (THE)", "description": "Matthew Reisz reflects on the issues raised by\u00a0Linsey McGoey\u2019s new book on \u2018philanthrocapitalism\u2019", "title": "Billionaires, altruism and the rise of the \u2018philanthrocapitalists\u2019", "url": "https://www.timeshighereducation.com/blog/billionaires-altruism-and-rise-philanthrocapitalists", "image": "https://www.timeshighereducation.com/sites/default/files/istock_000056969746_small.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-10-14T10:50:21+01:00", "type": "article"}, "google-site-verification": "KJs1E-IVyjYA-caTRM8z_rMaVUI_xI-lHuRXCAqu4Zo", "msvalidate.01": "DBA2827FABEE1B561280B9DBAD77C9A3", "article": {"published_time": "2015-10-14T10:36:00+01:00", "modified_time": "2015-10-14T10:50:21+01:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "mz": {"pagename": "Billionaires, altruism and the rise of the \u2018philanthrocapitalists\u2019", "section": "academic", "type": "article", "id": 134389, "language": "und"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd38c2\"", "article_summary": "We may be broadly sympathetic to the goals of, for example, the Gates Foundation and the energy with which \u201cthe saint of Seattle\u201d is pursuing them.\nSomething similar applies to \u201cthe private education movement in the US\u201d that McGoey fears may be transferred to the UK.\nCan and should altruism be combined with making a profit?\nThere has been widespread debate about what it means for universities to become more like businesses.\nYet although \u201cpeople are getting rich through taxpayer-funded initiatives, the impact for students has not yet proved to justify such a level of public investment\u201d."}
