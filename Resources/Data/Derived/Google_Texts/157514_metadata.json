He represents the American League\u2019s best pitcher. And yet the Seahawks might talk more about the strike zone than the Mariner\u2019s King.\n\nSeattle revels in its reputation as a fast, physical defense. Anyone who saw the Seahawks face the Broncos in the Super Bowl know they are violent. But they are smart.\n\nRather than bemoan the new safety rules preventing targeting with the head and crushing defenseless receivers, defensive coordinator Dan Quinn promotes proper tackling by using a \u201cstrike zone.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe went the other way with it. How can we do it the right way and be physical. So we talk about a strike zone, just like a pitcher would have with a batter,\u201d Quinn said Tuesday, showing a visitor how his defenders approach the issue. \u201cYou target specific areas, have a plan of a attack and take the head out of it.\u201d\n\nCoach Pete Carroll released a 20-minute video for youth football organizations recently, showing proper techniques. The Seahawks focus on shoulder hits, resembling those seen in rugby.\n\nThey have bought into the philosophy, starting with the defensive backs. The Seahawks\u2019 secondary is so close, Quinn said, that it\u2019s not uncommon for the Legion of Boom to meet on their own to dissect plays and coverages.\n\n\u201c(Safety) Earl Thomas watched every game from the last two years, looking for ways to improve,\u201d Quinn said.\n\nSeattle will not be at full strength for Thursday\u2019s exhibition opener at Sports Authority Field at Mile High. Strong safety Kam Chancellor continues to recover from offseason hip surgery.\n\n\u201cI am fine. No problems. I will be back out there soon,\u201d Chancellor said Tuesday.\n\nFootnotes\n\nThe Seahawks\u2019 practices feature a soundtrack. It is approved by coaches, but executed by DJ DV One. He plays everything to Guns N\u2019 Roses to old school hip-hop. He\u2019s featured in the video below. \u2026 Former CU receiver Paul Richardson caught a long touchdown pass on a go route down the left sideline. \u2026 Quarterback Russell Wilson connected with Percy Harvin on a bomb down the middle, leading to loud cheers from the estimated 2,800 fans in attendance. \u2026 Running back Marshawn Lynch, who held out at the beginning of training camp, is working back in form quickly. He made several nice runs in team drills, including a touchdown that ended with cornerback Richard Sherman playfully slapping the ball out of his hands after Lynch scored.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Dan Quinn,Kam Chancellor,Marshawn Lynch,Percy Harvin,Pete Carroll,Russell Wilson", "language": "en, sv", "og": {"site_name": "First-and-Orange", "description": "The Seattle Seahawks coaches are teaching proper \"strike zone\" tackling technique to a defense already known for its aggressiveness.", "title": "Seattle Seahawks tackle: Coaches teach 'strike zone' technique", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/2014/08/05/forget-mariners-seahawks-focus-strike-zone/28575/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/files/2014/08/seattle-seahawks-tackling.jpg", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "The Seattle Seahawks coaches are teaching proper \"strike zone\" tackling technique to a defense already known for its aggressiveness.", "title": "Seattle Seahawks tackling: Coaches teach \u2018strike zone\u2019 technique", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/2014/08/05/forget-mariners-seahawks-focus-strike-zone/28575/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/files/2014/08/seattle-seahawks-tackling.jpg", "creator": "@troyrenck", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "The Seattle Seahawks coaches are teaching proper \"strike zone\" tackling technique to a defense already known for its aggressiveness."}, "article_summary": "And yet the Seahawks might talk more about the strike zone than the Mariner\u2019s King.\nSo we talk about a strike zone, just like a pitcher would have with a batter,\u201d Quinn said Tuesday, showing a visitor how his defenders approach the issue.\n\u2026 Running back Marshawn Lynch, who held out at the beginning of training camp, is working back in form quickly.\nAnyone who saw the Seahawks face the Broncos in the Super Bowl know they are violent.\n\u201c(Safety) Earl Thomas watched every game from the last two years, looking for ways to improve,\u201d Quinn said."}
