But research advancing at two U.S. labs is finding that a key ingredient of sarin carries subtle hydrocarbon impurities that vary from sample to sample, forming a telltale and persistent fingerprint.\n\nThis means that if sarin was used again in a war or terror attack, investigators could determine, say, whether it was from the same batch as the chemical used in Syria or matched evidence found in the home of a suspect.\n\n\u201cOnce you know it\u2019s sarin\u2014the next question is where did it come from?\u201d says Carlos Fraga, a chemist at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory in Richland, Washington, who coauthored a 2011 paper on the method with colleagues at Battelle Memorial Institute in Columbus, Ohio. \u201cThe U.S. government wants to be ready when there might be a chemical attack.\u201d If there is, it could now be possible to figure out who might be responsible.\n\nThe work isn\u2019t of immediate relevance in attributing the August 21 attack in Syria. The United States says substantial evidence implicates the Syrian regime in the attack, in which the United States says 1,429 people were killed, including 426 children.\n\nBut in the future, the technology could be important, says Ralf Trapp, a chemist and technical consultant to the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, in The Hague. \u201cIn the Cold War context, identifying batches wasn\u2019t the issue; if one side used it, the other side knows where it came from,\u201d he says. \u201cIn the context of terrorism, now it could be of interest.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "New technology improves our ability to trace the deadly nerve agent", "title": "How to trace a sarin attack", "og": {"url": "http://www.salon.com/2013/09/09/how_to_trace_a_sarin_attack_newscred/", "site_name": "Salon", "type": "article", "description": "New technology improves our ability to trace the deadly nerve agent", "title": "How to trace a sarin attack"}, "twitter": {"description": "New technology improves our ability to trace the deadly nerve agent", "title": "How to trace a sarin attack", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@davidtalbot"}, "author": "David Talbot", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Chemical weapon, MIT Technology Review, sarin, Science, technology", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Topics: Chemical weapon, MIT Technology Review, sarin, Science, technology, Technology News, Business News, Politics NewsNew research indicates that chemical fingerprints can make positive matches between batches of sarin.\nSarin sleuths: A United Nations expert, wearing a gas mask, holds a plastic bag containing samples from one of the sites of an alleged chemical weapons attack in Damascus.\n\u201cThe U.S. government wants to be ready when there might be a chemical attack.\u201d If there is, it could now be possible to figure out who might be responsible.\nThe work isn\u2019t of immediate relevance in attributing the August 21 attack in Syria.\nThis means that if sarin was used again in a war or terror attack, investigators could determine, say, whether it was from the same batch as the chemical used in Syria or matched evidence found in the home of a suspect."}
