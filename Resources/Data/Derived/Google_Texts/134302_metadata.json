In search of freedom, they set sail in flotillas of rickety fishing boats, ingeniously converted cars, and crude homemade rafts.\n\nFor her part, the United States welcomed each successive wave with mostly open arms until President Clinton amended the 1966 Cuban Adjustment Act in 1994. Since then, only Cuban refugees who make it to dry ground have been granted political asylum.\n\nAs Washington renews diplomatic relations with Havana, The Daily Signal takes a look back at the historic Cuban exodus to freedom.\n\nIn October 1965, Castro announced that the port of Camarioca would be opened for any Cubans wishing to sail for the \u201cYankee Paradise.\u201d More than 2,900 fled before Castro closed the port.\n\nIn 1980, facing intense political pressure, Castro opened the Mariel port for those wishing to leave. More than 125,000 left the island.\n\nWith the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, economic conditions in Cuba suffered dramatically and thousands of immigrants took flight.\n\nStruggling to manage the flow of refugees, President Bill Clinton amended the 1966 Cuban Adjustment Act. The subsequent \u201cwet foot/dry foot\u201d policy allowed refugees to remain only if they reached dry land. If detained at sea by the Coast Guard, refugees must return to Cuba.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Since Fidel Castro seized power in 1959, a steady stream of Cuban refugees has taken to the waves in a desperate attempt to escape the Communist regime.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Since Fidel Castro seized power in 1959, a steady stream of Cuban refugees has taken to the waves in a desperate attempt to escape the Communist regime.", "title": "These Cubans Risked It All to Escape Communism.
