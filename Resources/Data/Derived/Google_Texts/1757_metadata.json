The agency had just announced a record number of chickenpox cases among schoolchildren, but declined to identify the schools involved.\n\nBased on the agency\u2019s previous handling of similar requests \u2014 including refusing to name a southern Maine restaurant where diners were exposed to hepatitis A last November \u2014 my hopes weren\u2019t high.\n\nLast week I received a response from Maine CDC to my request, which I filed under Maine\u2019s Freedom of Access Act, the public \u201cright to know\u201d law. The agency again refused to provide the information, insisting the records are confidential under Maine law, with two exceptions:\n\n(Chapter 250 spells out how the state should respond to and publicize infectious disease outbreaks.)\n\nTheir legal argument is that releasing the information could potentially identify a child who contracted an infectious illness. Exactly how that could happen is beyond me. I asked only for school names, not for the names of individual children.\n\nThe agency typically releases this kind of data only at the county level. But it has made exceptions in the past, such as in October 2013, when it identified a Durham church where attendees were sickened by hepatitis A, and in April, naming the Kittery Outlet Malls as the site of a measles exposure. In May, Maine CDC released vaccination rates for nearly all of the state\u2019s elementary schools.\n\nThe state saw a \u201cpublic health benefit\u201d to releasing the information in those cases of illness, because people could still take action to lessen their risk or ward off the disease (such as a vaccine for the churchgoers and avoiding the outlet malls). But with outbreaks of chickenpox and other diseases in schools, it sees \u201cno public health purpose\u201d to releasing the records I requested.\n\n\u201cThe outbreaks have long since passed, and any symptoms related to chicken pox would have already occurred,\u201d Maine CDC Director and COO Kenneth Albert said in a June 12 statement.\n\nHe also highlighted the availability of the school-by-school vaccination data among the reasons to shield outbreak information. But if that data benefits the public, wouldn\u2019t the same logic apply to outbreaks?\n\n\u201cThere is a concern that the names of the schools when paired with the recently released school-by-school immunization data may allow for the identification of an individual student which violates state and federal law,\u201d Albert said in the statement.\n\nAgain, I\u2019m unclear as to how that could occur. Identifying whether outbreaks are occurring in areas where parents are skipping vaccines for their kids seems to me of clear public benefit.\n\nSchools typically notify parents of such outbreaks, so those most directly affected were likely aware of the chickenpox cases. But students, their families and school staff aren\u2019t the only ones at risk. People with compromised immune systems \u2014 such as the elderly and those recovering from cancer treatment \u2014 also must be wary of outbreaks, among others.\n\nHere\u2019s how three groups, including one representing health care journalists, recommends public health officials handle such requests:\n\n\u201cPublic health officials should strive to release as much information as possible, within the limits of the law. Withhold information only when there is a clearly justified reason to keep it confidential,\u201d read the overarching principles of recommendations sponsored by the National Association of County and City Health Officials, the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials, and the Association of Health Care Journalists.\n\nThe same voluntary guidelines urge journalists to ask public health officials why they\u2019re withholding information and explain their reasoning to readers. So there you have it.\n\nThe Portland Press Herald has similarly asked for and been denied disease outbreak data. The newspaper announced last week that it\u2019s suing the state in an attempt to force it to release the names of schools where chickenpox outbreaks have occurred.\n\nNow it\u2019s up to the courts to decide what the public has a right to know.\n\nRecommend this article", "article_metadata": {"wp-parsely_version": "1.7", "fb": {"app_id": 748756371893770}, "viewport": "width=device-width", "generator": "WordPress 4.1.5"}, "article_summary": "But with outbreaks of chickenpox and other diseases in schools, it sees \u201cno public health purpose\u201d to releasing the records I requested.\nThe same voluntary guidelines urge journalists to ask public health officials why they\u2019re withholding information and explain their reasoning to readers.\nThe newspaper announced last week that it\u2019s suing the state in an attempt to force it to release the names of schools where chickenpox outbreaks have occurred.\nHere\u2019s how three groups, including one representing health care journalists, recommends public health officials handle such requests:\u201cPublic health officials should strive to release as much information as possible, within the limits of the law.\nThe agency again refused to provide the information, insisting the records are confidential under Maine law, with two exceptions:(Chapter 250 spells out how the state should respond to and publicize infectious disease outbreaks.)"}
