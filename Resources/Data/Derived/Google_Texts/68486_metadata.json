Republican leaders created the drought conditions. Donald Trump simply struck the match.\u201d\n\nReid cited a myriad of examples of Democratic policies and proposals over the course of President Obama\u2019s administration that he felt Republicans acted unfairly towards, including the Affordable Care Act, gun control, and most recently, Obama\u2019s nomination of Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court.\n\nReid said Republican obstructionism bred \u201cresentment and hatred\u201d in its party. \u201cThis resentment and hatred took three main forms,\u201d he said. \u201cFirst, rendering President Barack Obama \u201cillegitimate.\u201d Second, fear-mongering against Muslims. Third, sowing hatred against Latinos. These forces, which are all now synonymous with Donald Trump\u2019s candidacy, were incubated by Republican leaders for the past eight years.\u201d\n\nIn the end, Reid called on Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Speaker of the House Paul Ryan to denounce Trump, and for Congressional Democrats to push forward progressive policies.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Harry Reid delivered a blistering speech Thursday morning blaming Republican leadership for Donald Trump's rise.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "TIME.com", "description": "\"Republican leaders created the drought conditions.
