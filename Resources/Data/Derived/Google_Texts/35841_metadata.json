Warner Brothers opposed registration based on a number of trademark applications and registrations for marks referencing elements from the Wizard of Oz book, covering merchandise.\n\nThe applicant unsuccessfully put forth the argument that since the Warner Brothers' trademarks referenced characters, themes, concepts, and drawings taking directly from the book, which was published in 1899 and is now in the public domain, Warner Brothers should not be able to claim trademark rights in these elements. It appears from the record that FLYING MONKEY WINE never got off the ground.\n\nThis case serves an important reminder of the difference between trademarks and copyrights \u2013 particularly in the creative context. Even though certain characters, locations, and elements appear within a copyrighted artistic work \u2013 such as Disney's iconic Mickey Mouse \u2013 the expiration of the copyright in the artistic work does not necessarily mean that the characters within are available for use by others in a trademark sense. In other words, even if the trademark you plan to adopt is adapted from a public domain creative work, do not assume it is available for use and registration as a trademark. The usual search and clearance process should be undertaken to ensure a mark is available for use and registration.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The important distinction between copyrighted artistic works, and use of elements from those works as trademarks.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"site_name": "The National Law Review", "description": "Continuing our primate theme, we thought this would be as good a time as any to remind our readers as to the important distinction between copyrighted artistic works, and use of elements from those wo", "title": "Why FLYING MONKEY WINE Never Got Off the Ground", "url": "http://www.natlawreview.com/article/why-flying-monkey-wine-never-got-ground", "image": "http://www.natlawreview.com/sites/default/files/styles/thumbnail/public/article/aux/1131/monkey%20sticking%20out%20his%20tongue.jpg?itok=azNhx5We", "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Legal, Business, Kansas, Intellectual Property, Copyright, Trademark, Wizard of Oz, FLYING MONKEY WINE, Warner Brothers", "msvalidate.01": "5493B547C0AB527FF4CF8C4D0127302A", "google-site-verification": "SAKcOmA6_i0E79oG2TjlPWfOSs9kMM6EWAZNaT0aBtA", "verify-v1": "nSkrvEqyOIUMGKMak3OBIKcpcABac4XWK5NJKMuMtBY=", "y_key": "fe6cd8bd83ff0c09", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Legal, Business, Kansas, Intellectual Property, Copyright, Trademark, Wizard of Oz, FLYING MONKEY WINE, Warner Brothers"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc09c\"", "article_summary": "By way of illustration, several years ago a Kansas winery attempted to register the trademark names associated with the Wizard of Oz, for wine \u2013 including FLYING MONKEY WINE.\nIt appears from the record that FLYING MONKEY WINE never got off the ground.\nWarner Brothers opposed registration based on a number of trademark applications and registrations for marks referencing elements from the Wizard of Oz book, covering merchandise.\nThe usual search and clearance process should be undertaken to ensure a mark is available for use and registration.\nThis case serves an important reminder of the difference between trademarks and copyrights \u2013 particularly in the creative context."}
