The restaurant staff and about 120 volunteers served an estimated 2,500 guests. The restaurant works with homeless shelters, other agencies and other businesses to provide the meal.\n\nChopHouse general manager Collin McDowell has only one regret: \u201cI\u2019m ashamed we only do this one day a year.\u201d\n\nThe ChopHouse has offered a free holiday meal for 18 years, and it was McDowell who changed it from a buffet line to a sit-down dinner, where guests could choose between ham and turkey entrees.\n\n\u201cMy thought is this is a group that spends an awful lot of time standing in line,\u201d he said.\n\nChopHouse and its charitable arm, CraftWorks Foundation, are working to combat hunger in the areas where they operate restaurants. McDowell is passionate on the issue, saying the country isn\u2019t lacking in food or money but, rather, people willing to share what they have.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s heartbreaking,\u201d he said.\n\nBut it was uplifting at the restaurant, where children received gifts, stockings and professional photographs of themselves with Santa.\n\nHeavenleigh\u2019s mother, Clarissa, at the ChopHouse also with her boyfriend and his small three children, said it was exciting to have \u201ca real Christmas meal.\u201d\n\nCrystal Yazzie, mother of three children, ages 3, 5 and 6, said they don\u2019t dine out often. When they do, it\u2019s not at a place as nice as the ChopHouse.\n\nOutside the ChopHouse, Jerry Donovan greeted guests. This is his seventh year.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m single,\u201d the 68-year-old Littleton resident said, \u201cso I\u2019d rather do this than watch some dumb football game.\u201d\n\nJust then, one of the departing guests, wearing a tattered hooded sweatshirt, nodded to Donovan.\n\n\u201cIt was a magnificent meal,\u201d he said. \u201cThank you very much.\u201d\n\nLynn Bartels: 303-954-5327, lbartels@denverpost.com or twitter.com/lynn_bartels\n\nChristmas 2013 A day for giving and receiving", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Denver ChopHouse holiday meal delights the needy, fulfills volunteers", "title": "Denver ChopHouse holiday meal delights the needy, fulfills volunteers", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2013/12/25/denver-chophouse-holiday-meal-delights-the-needy-fulfills-volunteers/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20131225__CD26HOLIDAYHC1_2541p1.jpg", "height": 426}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20131225__CD26HOLIDAYHC1_2541p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2013-12-25T14:04:23+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-28T15:48:14+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd735f\"", "article_summary": "But it was uplifting at the restaurant, where children received gifts, stockings and professional photographs of themselves with Santa.\n\u201cWe love it, we love it, we love it,\u201d he said of volunteering.\nIt was hard to figure out who was having the best time at the Denver ChopHouse on Christmas \u2014 those who received a free meal or those who served it.\nChopHouse and its charitable arm, CraftWorks Foundation, are working to combat hunger in the areas where they operate restaurants.\nOver at the bar, Todd Welter of Arvada and his family prepared sodas, hot chocolate and coffee for the guests."}
