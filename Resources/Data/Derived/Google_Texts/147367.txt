The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has awarded $2 million to fund renovations and construction work at two Arkansas health centers.

The recipients, each receiving $1 million, are Healthy Connections Inc. of Mena and Mainline Health Systems Inc. of Dermott, according to an award winner list.

In a news release, the federal agency said about 4,927 new patients in the state are expected to benefit from the additional funding.

“Health centers are cornerstones of the communities they serve,” said department Secretary Sylvia M. Burwell in a statement. “Today’s awards will empower health centers in Arkansas to build more capacity and provide health care to additional individuals and their families.”

The funding comes from the Affordable Care Act's Community Health Center Fund, according to Wednesday's news release.
