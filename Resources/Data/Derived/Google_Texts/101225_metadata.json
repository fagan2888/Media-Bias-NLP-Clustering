Yet auditors question whether much of that money is getting into the right hands. After a review of the police force payroll, SIGAR found that personnel numbers had been inflated \u2013 as had salaries for certain officers.\n\nThe auditors faulted the Department of Defense for not having an effective way to track where the money is going.\n\n\u201cDespite 13 years and several billions of dollars in salary assistance to the Afghan government for the ANP, there is still no assurance that personnel and payroll data are accurate,\u201d the IG report said.\n\nRelated: $100 Billion in Aid Squandered in Afghanistan\n\nThe report also found that very loose oversight of problems with the electronic accounting systems as well as \u201clittle or no physical verification\u201d of who\u2019s actually receiving money from the U.S. have led to the waste of millions of dollars.\n\nSIGAR confirmed that in some cases, officers routinely forged daily attendance records for police in order to inflate their personnel numbers so they would receive more funding \u2013 and that DOD had no way of knowing which names were forged.\n\nThis has been a problem for years. Earlier on, federal watchdogs revealed similar findings.\n\nIn 2009 the Government Accountability Office released a report that found one third of the Afghan National Police listed on the payroll could not be accounted for.\n\nRelated: FEMA Does It Again \u2013 Overpays $177M in Hurricane Relief\n\nAuditors warn that lax oversight over the ANP payroll is not only wasteful to taxpayers \u2013 it could mean that many Afghan police officers are getting shorted since others are inflating their own salaries. SIGAR said that roughly one fifth of all ANP staff could potentially have their salaries cut in half because their officers don\u2019t have to document their payments and the DOD can\u2019t verify them.\n\nCorruption has largely plagued the whole reconstruction effort in Afghanistan. Special Inspector General John Sopko has routinely warned that if the U.S.\u2019s anti-corruption strategy fails, it could undermine the entire decade-long operation in Afghanistan. So far, the auditor has warned that it is indeed failing.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Government watchdogs have consistently and urgently warned that corruption in Afghanis", "title": "Pentagon Refuses to Verify $300 Million a Year in Afghanistan Is Spent Properly", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/01/12/Pentagon-Refuses-Verify-300-Million-Year-Afghanistan-Spent-Properly", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/08092013_Afghan_Trucks_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/01/12/Pentagon-Refuses-Verify-300-Million-Year-Afghanistan-Spent-Properly", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/08092013_Afghan_Trucks_article.jpg", "title": "The Fiscal Times", "card": "summary", "creator": "@Briannaehley"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "Government watchdogs have consistently and urgently warned that corruption in Afghanis", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd18d5\"", "article_summary": "After a review of the police force payroll, SIGAR found that personnel numbers had been inflated \u2013 as had salaries for certain officers.\nGovernment watchdogs have consistently and urgently warned that corruption in Afghanistan could completely undermine the U.S.\u2019s $104 billion reconstruction effort in that war-ridden country.\nSpecial Inspector General John Sopko has routinely warned that if the U.S.\u2019s anti-corruption strategy fails, it could undermine the entire decade-long operation in Afghanistan.\nThe auditors faulted the Department of Defense for not having an effective way to track where the money is going.\nCorruption has largely plagued the whole reconstruction effort in Afghanistan."}
