He played a key role in passing legislation to clean polluted air, provide medical insurance for children and regulate tobacco as well as the 2009 Affordable Care Act.\n\nThose issues have resonance with liberal voters on the Westside and San Fernando Valley, making Waxman's backing a coveted one, analysts say. Kuehl will face former Santa Monica council member and mayor Bobby Shriver in the general election.\n\nRetiring Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky, the man Kuehl and Shriver are seeking to replace, has so far remained silent on his candidate preference. Yaroslavsky's endorsement would be \"the gold standard\" in the race, said Steve Afriat, a veteran lobbying and political consultant.\n\nBut Waxman's is also significant, Afriat said.\n\n\"In the heavily Jewish, liberal Westside?,'' he said. \"I would give 10 endorsements for Henry Waxman's endorsement.\"\n\nShriver has been endorsed by former state Assembly Speaker Bob Hertzberg, former Clinton Administration Secretary of Commerce Mickey Kantor, former U.S. Rep. Howard Berman and former Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan.\n\nTwitter: @csaillant2", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "U.S. Rep.
