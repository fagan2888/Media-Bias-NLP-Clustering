Officer Darren Wilson, the policeman at the heart of the Ferguson furor, is currently discussing how best to resign his post from the department, his attorney told CNN.

“It’s not a question of if, it’s a question of when,” Neil Bruntrager told the media cable outlet. “He’s on paid leave, and there are discussions that are going on right now to separate from the department in an amicable fashion.”

Officer Wilson, who shot and killed teen Michael Brown during an altercation on Aug. 9 in Ferguson, said he’s been living with considerable stress since the incident and sometimes in fear.

“I’d use the word stressful, but that’s an understatement,” Officer Wilson said during an interview with ABC’s George Stephanopoulos. “You just take precautions — everything you do, everywhere you go. You know, from where you sit in a restaurant to where you drive.”

He also said he worries about “someone hurting my family or another officer getting hurt.”

Barbara Spradling, his new wife and fellow Ferguson police officer, is expecting a baby, he said, the New York Post reported.
