We needed our money,\" she added.\n\nWashington said, \"I got up and bent his arm back.\" He said he didn't know whether the man had a gun, but wasn't scared.\n\nWashington and cook Michael Ford held the thief until police arrived, said Metoyer.\n\nPolice said Pablo Ciscart, 50, was arrested on a simple robbery charge. It wasn't clear whether he has an attorney who could speak for him.\n\nMetoyer said she and Griffin already had decided to hire Washington, but hadn't had a chance to tell him when the theft occurred. She said they told him afterward, \"You're hired. You earned it.\"", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Star Tribune", "description": "A job interview was in progress when a thief grabbed cash from the till at a fast food restaurant.
