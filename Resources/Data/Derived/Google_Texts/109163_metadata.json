John Kasich said Friday ever-intensifying partisanship and a lack of unifying leadership in Washington is having a divisive effect on the American society.\n\nJohn Kasich John Kasich (R) is a candidate for president in 2016. More\n\nAfter discussing fiscal, energy and regulatory policy at a business-oriented town hall-style discussion in the state\u2019s largest city, Kasich waxed philosophical when asked how he would, as president, try to unify the nation.\n\nKasich said it is up to politicians to convince Americans that they have the public interest at heart, \u201cand we are not there as Republicans or Democrats.\u201d He said he has worked with Democrats in his home state and as chairman of the U.S. House Budget Committee in the mid-1990s.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really hard, but you have to convince people of the greater purpose,\u201d Kasich told about 40 Granite Staters who crowded into a small room at the historic Franklin Pierce Carpenter House on Elm Street. \u201cI\u2019ve done it most of my lifetime. It will wear you out, but you have to do something when you\u2019re on this earth.\n\n\u201cWe are increasingly living in a society where the family has been weakened, where we\u2019re increasingly isolated from one another,\u201d Kasich said. \u201cThat\u2019s not America. And as a president or even as a governor, it\u2019s limited what I can do about it, but I can talk about it.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019ve lost some of our spirit, and a president can show, talk and be a role model.\n\n\u201cIsn\u2019t that at the heart of some of our problems? That it\u2019s all about my re-election and my golden parachute or the number of views that they get on TV? The sense that we\u2019re all in this together has been somewhat lost,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cShow respect to people,\u201d Kasich said. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to agree with them, but you don\u2019t have to hate them.\u201d\n\nKasich has spent 32 days in New Hampshire since the beginning of the year, according to the WMUR Candidate Tracker, relying mostly on the traditional Granite State town hall format.\n\nHe opened the hour-long meeting by questioning President Barack Obama\u2019s veto of the $612 billion defense authorization bill.\n\n\u201cMy understanding is that he vetoed it because he wanted the other non-defense discretionary spending to rise,\u201d Kasich said. \u201cSo, it appears he was kind of holding the military underneath his thumb, saying he\u2019s not going to give a pay raise to the men and women of the military because he wants all this other spending.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s just not right. And I think the Republicans and Democrats who voted for it should try to override the president.\u201d\n\nKasich called for a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution and promoted a plan he released last week to balance the federal budget in eight years.\n\nHe supported the New Hampshire Legislature\u2019s passage of a budget that lowered business taxes.\n\n\u201cThink about it like a restaurant,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you have a restaurant and you have no customers, would you raise prices? No, we have to cut our prices, cut the overhead.\u201d\n\nKasich also spoke with more than a hint of sarcasm about non-traditional politicians, such as Donald Trump and Ben Carson, dominating the race for the GOP presidential nomination.\n\n\u201cIn politics today, if you have any experience in it, people question you,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you have no experience in it, they believe you. That\u2019s a really great way for a country to think about this.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to a doctor, but I\u2019m going to go to somebody who does not have a medical license,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople practice this alternative medicine for a while and then when it gets really serious, what do they do? They run to the doctor and say, \u2018Why did I wait so long?\u2019 We can\u2019t make the same mistake when we\u2019re picking a president.\u201d\n\nKasich opposed a federal minimum wage hike, saying states should decide the issue individually. He called for a one-year freeze on federal regulations and proposed the appointment of \u201cindependent people\u201d to help business owners navigate the regulatory morass through what he called \u201ca court of common sense.\u201d\n\nKasich was question about money in politics by a man who said he once worked for U.S. Sen. Warren Rudman.\n\nKasich responded, \u201cLet me ask you something. Did money in politics affect Warren Rudman?\"\n\n\u201cI knew Warren, and Warren could care less who gave him money,\u201d Kasich said. \u201cI don\u2019t give a rip about who gives me anything.\n\n\u201cThe way I look at it, when people give me money, it doesn\u2019t matter to me. They have no influence on me. If, all of a sudden, they had influence, I wouldn\u2019t balance the budget because I would have ceded the moral high ground. I\u2019d be taking care of somebody.\u201d\n\nHe said that ultimately, \u201cIt depends on how you do your job. You can\u2019t legislate character.\u201d\n\nQuestioned about climate change, Kasich said it exists and \u201cI do believe that man impacts it. I\u2019m just not certain how much.\u201d\n\nHe said his energy policy is: \u201cWe need everything. We need oil, gas, clean coal. We need renewables.\n\n\u201cI believe we need to care about the environment,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Lord gave it to us, and we have to care for it. Not worship it but take care of it. We should promote the renewables, but we should not ignore the other things that work because it\u2019s all part of our economy.\u201d\n\nKasich said he would keep the AmeriCorps program intact but would not increase its funding. He said he would double funding for the National Institutes of Health.\n\nHe proposed repealing the Affordable Care Act and replacing it with a program that rewards health care providers for acting on preventative measures.\n\nKasich took an interest in a dispute between the Londonderry School District and the U.S. Department of Agriculture over the town\u2019s school lunch program. When the district decided to drop out of the federal program, the USDA reportedly classified the high school\u2019s kitchens a \u201cfood processing facility,\u201d subject to heavy regulations and requiring new equipment.\n\nThe dispute appears to have subsided, but Kasich directed his staff to pursue it, telling those at the meeting that the federal government should stay out of school lunch programs.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Politics", "ib-analytics": "data", "item-publish-date": "Fri, 23 Oct 2015 19:11:46 EDT", "generator": "ibPublish 2", "author": "John DiStaso", "og": {"site_name": "WMUR", "description": "Warning that \u201cwe\u2019ve lost some of our spirit,\u201d Ohio Gov.
