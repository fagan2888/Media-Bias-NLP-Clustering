She had left her small town of Quebradillas and settled in the Park City two weeks after her husband.\n\nIn Puerto Rico, it took Vargas almost a year to find work as a low-wage earner at a Subway sandwich shop. In Bridgeport, 23-year-old Vargas was working in the bakery and making the state\u2019s minimum wage of $9.15 an hour two weeks after her arrival. Vargas now manages the popular East End shop.\n\nCarmen Montalvo, 26, another worker at the bakery, came to Connecticut in January with her two kids.\n\nMore Information Population Figures collected by the U.S. Census for 2013 show the number of Hispanic and number of Puerto Rican residents in the state and several cities, and the percent of the population. Location Number Percent Connecticut Hispanics 496,939 13.9 percent Puerto Ricans 267,798 7.5 percent Bridgeport Hispanics 55,758 38.3 percent Puerto Ricans 31,244 21.2 percent Stamford Hispanics 32,850 26.5 percent Puerto Ricans 4,576 3.7 percent\n\nMontalvo and Vargas came to Bridgeport because of family connections, but have the same answer when you ask why they left Puerto Rico.\n\n\u201cPor trabajar,\u201d \u2014 to work.\n\nDogged by a growing fiscal crisis, Puerto Rico is $72 billion dollars in debt and that figure is growing. Inhabitants are leaving the island in numbers not seen in more than 50 years. They are coming to states like Connecticut, which has the highest proportion of Puerto Ricans in the nation.\n\n\u201cIn Puerto Rico, you have a poverty rate of 45 percent, an unemployment rate of 8.5 percent,\u201d said Ingrid Alvarez-Dimarzo, state director for the Hispanic Federation. \u201cWhen people can\u2019t sustain themselves, they are going to migrate where they have connections and families, and that\u2019s Connecticut.\u201d\n\nBoricuas in Bridgeport\n\nLast year, 84,000 people left Puerto Rico for the U.S. mainland, a 38 percent increase from 2010, according to a Pew Research Center analysis of census data. Pew also found that at the same time, fewer Puerto Ricans were moving back to the island.\n\nPuerto Ricans have been coming to Bridgeport since at least 1844, when Joseph de Rivera, a sugar and wine merchant from Puerto Rico, bought a home on the East End, according to an article from the Bridgeport Library.\n\nIn the 1920s, Puerto Ricans already working in the U.S. came to the \u201cNutmeg State\u201d after they found relatives and friends working in easier conditions and for better pay at factories across the state, according to Ruth Glasser, a University of Connecticut history professor. She examined the trend in an article titled \u201cFrom Rich Port to Bridgeport: Puerto Ricans in Connecticut.\u201d\n\nIn the 1950s, more Puerto Ricans arrived after agricultural agreements between the island and mainland brought workers here to help on various farms, including the many growing tobacco. In the 1970s and 80s, after advances in farm technology and frustration over poor conditions experienced by agricultural workers, even more Puerto Ricans wound up in industrial cities like Bridgeport and Hartford.\n\nEven though Puerto Ricans are pouring into Florida, New York still has the largest number, with over one million residents of Puerto Rican heritage. Connecticut has the highest proportion, as Puerto Ricans account for about 7.5 percent of the state\u2019s population. Of the half million Hispanics in Connecticut, half of them are Puerto Rican.\n\nNowhere is that more evident than on East Main Street. While Ecuadorean restaurants and Peruvian eateries have popped up on the thoroughfare, flags hanging on trees and barbershops, and mainstays like El Coquito Restaurant proclaim Puerto Rican pride.\n\nThere were an estimated 31,000 Puerto Ricans in Bridgeport in 2013, according to the American Community Survey, up from the 28,000 the year before. In 2014, that number grew to more than 33,000, as people like Jeismarie Vargas came looking for jobs.\n\nMaking up more than a quarter of the population in Bridgeport and growing, the number of Puerto Ricans in the city and state appears unlikely to slow anytime soon as the island continues to face economic woes.\n\nEconomic issues\n\nIn late June, Puerto Rico\u2019s governor, Alejandro Garcia Padilla, announced in a televised address that the island was unable to repay all of its $72 billion in debt.\n\nPadilla, an ally of Connecticut Gov. Dannel P Malloy, has frequented the state to drum up Latino support during election season. Padilla even paid a visit to one of Lamarche\u2019s bakeries in Hartford.\n\nThe reasons for the Puerto Rican debt crisis were examined in a report released last week by the Hispanic Federation, which has a branch in Connecticut. \u201cThis is something that has been escalating, and what has happened is that the island has run out of money,\u201d said Ingrid Alvarez-Dimarzo, Connecticut state director for the Hispanic Federation.\n\nAmong the factors examined in the report is the Jones Act. The law, which is almost 100 years old, requires all trade goods shipped between the island and the mainland be carried on U.S.-flagged ships. Otherwise high taxes and customs fees apply.\n\nThe law has increased costs for items on the island, and chipped away at Puerto Rico\u2019s export and import business, Alvarez-Dimarzo said.\n\nA big chunk of the island\u2019s debt, $25 billion, is related to health care costs. About 60 percent of island residents are enrolled in Medicaid or Medicare. Puerto Rico residents pay the same amount of Medicare payroll taxes as state residents, but Puerto Rico\u2019s Medicare Advantage program is currently funded at 60 percent of the state rate and is facing further cuts.\n\nMedicaid is expected to run out of funds by the end of next year, leaving 900,000 Puerto Ricans without health insurance.\n\n\u201cPuerto Rico is exempt from the Affordable Care Act; health care on the island is extremely expensive,\u201d Alvarez-Dimarzo said. \u201cAt times it\u2019s treated like a state and at times not, but these are U.S. citizens we are talking about. It\u2019s urgent.\u201d\n\nWhen asked what they liked about Bridgeport, Montalvo and Vargas \u2014 the two bakery workers who recently arrived in the city \u2014 cited affordable health care for their kids.\n\nSolving the problem\n\nAfter tax breaks that brought mainland companies to the island expired, those companies left. As people fled the island, with its lack of jobs, high health costs and expensive goods, Puerto Rico\u2019s tax base declined.\n\nThere are now more Puerto Ricans living on the mainland, a population of more than 5 million, than on the island, a population of 3.5 million.\n\nWith a declining tax base bringing in revenue to pay bills, Puerto Rico found only one kind of lender \u2014 wealthy hedge funds, according to the Hispanic Federation report. The report said those hedge fund interests were backers of changes in the island\u2019s constitution that mandated the local government to pay debt first, before providing funds to schools, energy and other vital public services. This spurred further emigration.\n\nWhile U.S. cities like Detroit can declare bankruptcy, U.S. law bars Puerto Rico from doing so.\n\nThis summer, U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., co-sponsored a bill that would allow the island\u2019s municipalities and public corporations to restructure and pay off debt, the Puerto Rico Chapter 9 Uniformity Act. \u201cI\u2019m perplexed and frustrated, so much time has passed for there to be support on this,\u201d Blumenthal said Friday. \u201cThis is not a bailout. There is no federal money being used. This is a reordering of debt.\u201d\n\nBeside people coming to the mainland U.S., there\u2019s another impact. Three out of every four municipal bond funds in the country hold Puerto Rican bonds, according to the Hispanic Federation report. Utilities like the Puerto Rican Power Co. are $8 billion in debt, and almost at the point of default.\n\n\u201cA lot of people in the state hold Puerto Rican bonds and have families there,\u201d said Blumenthal. \u201cIf the utilities go bankrupt, the value of the bonds they hold will be greatly reduced in value.\u201d\n\nOn Thursday, the Obama administration asked Congress to support Blumenthal\u2019s plan and help restructure the island\u2019s debt. The administration also asked Congress to boost the inadequate Medicaid funding, issues and allow Puerto Rico to have an Earned Income Tax Credit.\n\nBlumenthal compared the island to a badly beated or dying hospital patient. The debt is the bleeding that won\u2019t stop and that has to be addressed first, for to allow the island to live, before other operations and fixes can begin. \u201cI\u2019m proud people are seeing Connecticut as a place of opportunity and family,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the goal is creating long-term progress and economic opportunity on Puerto Rico, with jobs for everyone.\u201d\n\nAt Thursday\u2019s subcommittee meeting, the chairman, Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, said more time was needed to look into the island\u2019s finances to come up with a plan.\n\nAt the same meeting Padilla said time is running out and the island is at risk of defaulting on its debt by November or December.\n\n\u201cWithout hope and willingness of Congress to act, people will have to make decisions for their families,\u201d said Alvarez-Dimarzo, of the Hispanic Federation, whose report urged Congress and the president to act quickly on the island\u2019s problems. \u201cAnd they will look on the mainland and for their family here.\u201d\n\nAs of now, things don\u2019t look good for the \u201cisland of enchantment.\u201d According to the Pew Research Center, the island will lose another half million people by 2050, through a decline in births and emigration.", "article_metadata": {"SKYPE_TOOLBAR": "SKYPE_TOOLBAR_PARSER_COMPATIBLE", "description": "In Puerto Rico, it took Vargas almost a year to find work as a low-wage earner at a Subway sandwich shop.  \u201cIn Puerto Rico, you have a poverty rate of 45 percent, an unemployment rate of 8.5 percent,\u201d said Ingrid Alvarez-Dimarzo, state director for the Hispanic Federation.
