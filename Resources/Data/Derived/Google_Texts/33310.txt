Wasserman Schultz: Americans Weren't 'Myzled' on Obamacare

Debbie Wasserman Schultz, the Florida congresswoman and chair of the Democratic National Committee, told viewers of MSNBC Tuesday that Americans were not "myzled" by President Obama when it came to being able to keep their health plans under Obamacare.

"At the end of the day, Americans were not only not myzled [sic] by the president, the overwhelming majority of Americans are already insured," Wasserman Schultz said, apparently mispronouncing the word "misled."
