Historic village sites in the islands are at danger of being lost forever, reports the Los Angeles Times.\n\nThe Times was recently on Santa Cruz Island, where 11 historic village sites have been identified, with archaeologist Torben Rick, curator of anthropology at the Smithsonian\u2019s National Museum of Natural History.\n\n\u201cThings like this are golden because they can help us better understand the people who lived here and how they dealt with some of the same unstoppable forces we face today,\u201d he told the Times as he picked up a small pink bead. \u201cThe trouble is, a few more storms and all this valuable history will be washed out to sea.\u201d\n\nConservationists and archaeologists recently took the first full accounting of sites threatened on Santa Cruz Island.\n\nOf the dozens of sites recently surveyed, eight were designated as \u201ccode red,\u201d reports the Times, meaning they have significant archaeological resources and are in real danger of being destroyed by rising seas.\n\n\u201cThe real tragedy, and the urgency, is that sea level rise is destroying wholesale the opportunity to learn about our past\u2014information we can use to be better conservationists,\u201d Scott Morrison, the Nature Conservancy\u2019s director of conservation science, told the Times. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to do something about that.\u201d\n\nThe team that did the survey even conducted an \u201cemergency archaeological rescue\u201d of artifacts\u2014arrowheads, stone implements, woven rope and fabric\u2014buried in layers of sand and driftwood in a remote cave, reported the Times.\n\nThey also recovered a plank of redwood smeared with brown tar, it was used to repair a hole in a canoe.\n\n\u201cThe last time one of these planks was found was in the 1960s,\u201d Jon M. Erlandson, an archaeologist at the University of Oregon and expert on Santa Cruz Island\u2019s cultural resources, told the Times.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re standing on a living history book,\u201d Gil Unzueta, a Chumash Indian who is monitoring the survey effort, told the Times. \u201cAnd we\u2019re losing pages from it every day.\u201d\n\nToday, the Chumash people continue to celebrate their culture by re-creating the tomol crossings from the mainland to Santa Cruz Island, a harrowing journey. A tomol is a redwood canoe.\n\nRead more about the archaeological sites discovered on the Island in the article: \u201cHistoric Chumash Settlement on Eastern Santa Cruz Island, Southern California.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Indigenous people, primarily the Chumash, inhabited the Channel Islands as far back as 13,000 years ago.
