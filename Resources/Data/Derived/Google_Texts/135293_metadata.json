I am \u201cover the hill.\u201d Yup. My birthday is today, January 7, 1975, and I was born 40 years ago.\n\nInstead of moping around, I have decided to embrace my 40s. For starters, let\u2019s take a look at where we were 40 years ago. Obviously, personally, I was in utero. But what about the country? What about health care?\n\nNot surprisingly, even 40 years ago, politicians were discussing the same issues with health care as we are now. Some things never change\u2026or do they???\n\nIn my \u201c40 years in review\u201d blog, I want to discuss why we, as a nation, are still arguing about the same health care issues that we were arguing about 40 years ago. And, perhaps, the reason why we have been in a 40-year-old stalemate in health care reform.\n\nToday, we have a diverged nation when it comes to health care. Democrats want to expand public health insurance (i.e., Medicaid) and tend to favor a higher degree of government oversight of health care to ensure that health care is available to all people. Republicans, on the other hand, believe that the financial burden of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) on the federal and state level is unsustainable, and people will receive less than adequate health care. Republicans tend to favor privatization of Medicaid, while liberals oppose such ideas.\n\nHealth care reform has been a hot topic for over 40 years\u2026with some interesting differences\u2026\n\nGoing back to 1975\u2026\n\nGerald Ford, a Republican, was our nation\u2019s president, and we were in a nationwide recession.\n\nUnder Ford, the American Medical Society (AMA) proposed a new plan for health care, an employer mandate proposal.\n\nAccording to a 1975 Chicago Tribune journalist, the AMA\u2019s new proposal pushed for a broader government role in health care. See below.\n\n\u201cThe new [ ] plan would cover both employees and the unemployed, along with poor people and those considered uninsurable because of medical or mental problems. It would require employers to subsidize health care for employees and their families and pay at least 65 % of each premium. It would also require the government to provide partially subsidized health insurance, financed from general revenues, for the poor and the unemployed. It calls for medical insurance benefits covering 365 days of hospital care during any one year, 100 days of nursing home care, and home health, mental, and dental service for children aged 2 and up. All but the poorest beneficiaries would share premium costs and would pay 20 per cent for the services provided, but no individual would pay more than $1,500 a year and no family more than $2,000 a year for health care.\u201d\n\nChicago Tribune, \u201cThe A.M.A.\u2019s subsidy plan\u201d April 19, 1975 (emphasis added) (no author was cited).\n\nInterestingly, in that same newspaper from April 19, 1975, advertisements show towels for $1.89, pants for teenagers for $4.99, a swivel rocker for $88, and a BBQ grill for $12.88. My how times have changed!\n\nThose prices also indicate how much buying power was involved with the AMA\u2019s proposal, and what it meant to suggest that an individual might have to pay up to $1,500 a year, and a family up to $2,000 a year, for health care \u2013 a lot of money back then!\n\nIn 1976, Pres. Ford proposed adding catastrophic coverage to Medicare, offset by increased cost sharing. These are examples of Pres. Ford (a Republican) creating more government involvement in health care and expanding health care to everyone.\n\nAfter Pres. Ford, came Pres. Jimmy Carter from 1977-1981, a Democrat.\n\nPres. Carter campaigned on the notion of \u201cuniversal health care for everyone;\u201d however, once in office he decided instead to rein in costs, and not expand coverage. In the prior decade (1960), the consumer price index had increased by 79.7%, while hospital costs had risen 237%. President Carter proposed an across-the-board cap on hospital charges that would limit annual increases to 1.5 times any rise in the consumer price index.\n\nPres. Carter was also quoted from public speeches saying, \u201cWe must clean up the disgraceful Medicaid scandals.\u201d\n\nPres. Carter\u2019s stance on \u201cuniversal\u201d health care was: \u201cthat such a program would be financed through both the employer and the payroll taxes, as well as general revenue taxes. Patients would still be free to choose their own physician, but the federal government would set doctor\u2019s fees and establish controls to monitor the cost and quality of health care.\u201d\n\nIn May 1979, Senator Ted Kennedy, a Democrat, proposed a new universal national health insurance bill\u2014offering a choice of competing federally-regulated private health insurance plans with no cost sharing financed by income-based premiums via an employer mandate and individual mandate, replacement of Medicaid by government payment of premiums to private insurers, and enhancement of Medicare by adding prescription drug coverage and eliminating premiums and cost sharing.\n\nThese are examples of Democrats, Pres. Carter, by not expanding health care coverage and reining in costs, and Sen. Kennedy, by proposing privatization of Medicaid, acting in a more conservative nature, or, as a conservative nature would be perceived today.\n\nSo when did the parties flip-flop? Why did the parties flip-flop? And the most important question\u2026if we have been struggling with the exact same issues on health care for over 40 years, why has our health care system not been fixed? There has certainly been enough time, ideas, and proposed bills.\n\nWhile I do not profess to know the answer, my personal opinion is the severe and debilitating polarizations of the two main political parties have rendered this country into a 40-year-old stalemate when it comes to health care reform and are the reason why the solution has not been adopted and put into practice.\n\nMaybe back in 1979, when Senator Kennedy proposed replacing Medicaid with private insurance, Republicans refused to agree, simply because a Democrat proposed the legislation.\n\nToday when Republican candidates campaign on privatizing Medicaid and the Democrats vehemently oppose such action, maybe the opposition is not to the idea, but to the party making the proposal.\n\nJust a thought\u2026\n\nAnd here\u2019s to the next 40!!!", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/lordy-lordy-look-whos-forty-a-review-95934/", "type": "article", "image": "http://www.jdsupra.com/showThumbnail.aspx?img=15384_221.jpg&size=og", "site_name": "JD Supra", "title": "Lordy, Lordy, Look Who\u2019s Forty: A Review of Our 40-Year-Old Stalemate in Health Care Reform | JD Supra"}, "twitter": {"description": "Well, folks, it is official.
