So the government has been releasing the migrants into the U.S. \u2014 usually to live with family already here \u2014 and telling them to report within 15 days to the nearest ICE office.\n\nIn trying to deter future illegal border crossings, the Obama administration has said it prioritized deporting women with children because they are not entitled to the same protections as unaccompanied minors from Central America.\n\nIn June, ICE opened a temporary detention center for illegal immigrant families in Artesia, N.M. A second detention center in Karnes City, Texas, can house about 530 people.\n\nA third such detention center will open in Texas later this year. Before the new facilities, the government had space for fewer than 100 persons at its only family detention center in Pennsylvania.\n\nAltogether, U.S. detention facilities can house only about 1,200 family members, so most are released before their cases are processed.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Seven of every 10 families released after entering the country illegally don\u2019t return as instructed to meet with authorities, the Associated Press reports.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Seven of every 10 families released after entering the country illegally don\u2019t return as instructed to meet with authorities, the Associated Press reports.", "title": "7 in 10 Illegal Families No-Shows for Immigration Follow-Up", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/ImmNoShows.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-09-25T21:43:49+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1n5aVY7"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Seven of every 10 families released after entering the country illegally don\u2019t return as instructed to meet with authorities, the Associated Press reports.", "creator": "@dailysignal", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/ImmNoShows.jpg"}, "title": "7 in 10 Illegal Families No-Shows for Immigration Follow-Up", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Security", "tag": "immigration", "published_time": "2014-09-25T21:35:27+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-09-25T21:43:49+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "immigration hearings, deportations, illegal immigration, ICE, Artesia, detention center, Central America"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1d37\"", "article_summary": "Before the new facilities, the government had space for fewer than 100 persons at its only family detention center in Pennsylvania.\nIn June, ICE opened a temporary detention center for illegal immigrant families in Artesia, N.M.
