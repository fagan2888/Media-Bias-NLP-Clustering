It wants to help about 1.2 million enrollees renew their coverage or find a better deal. It also wants to reach more of the state's uninsured population and expand enrollment to 1.7 million people by mid-February.\n\nWe want these individuals to serve as examples for why getting covered matters. This ad campaign will reach every part of the state. \u2014 Peter Lee, executive director of Covered California\n\nBut the exchange will have to pull that off in three months \u2014 half the time it had during the first six-month enrollment period.\n\nPeter Lee, executive director of Covered California, said this next round of outreach will be harder in many ways because so many potential applicants have learned to live without health coverage. He pointed out that 56% of people eligible for federal premium subsidies have gone without health insurance for more than two years and 15% have never had health coverage.\n\nThe state aims to reach some of those people with TV ads featuring real-life consumers who signed up this year. The commercials end with the exchange's previous tagline of \"I'm In\" or \"Tengo un Plan\" in Spanish. The TV commercials are the centerpiece of a $46-million ad campaign that also includes radio, print and social media marketing.\n\n\"We want these individuals to serve as examples for why getting covered matters,\" Lee said. \"This ad campaign will reach every part of the state.\"\n\nConsumers can check their health plan options and proposed rates for 2015 at Covered California's online calculator. Regulators are expected to finalize these rates by Sept. 30.\n\nchad.terhune@latimes.com\n\nTwitter: @chadterhune", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "California health insurance exchange unveils ad campaign and outreach", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times", "author": "Los Angeles Times", "og": {"site_name": "latimes.com", "description": "Preparing for the second year of Obamacare enrollment, California unveiled new television ads and handed out $14.6 million to community groups for consumer outreach.", "title": "California health insurance exchange unveils ad campaign and outreach", "url": "http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-health-exchange-enroll-20140916-story.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-5417a77e/turbine/la-fi-health-exchange-enroll-20140916", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp11.13", "twitter": {"site": "@latimes", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "AAC9C18F70AC386BC4DCF4DDF9BF1786", "robots": "index,follow", "keywords": "Obamacare, Affordable Care Act, open enrollment, Covered California", "fb": {"admins": 100000786395051, "page_id": 5863113009}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=373238146, app-argument=http://www.latimes.com/deeplinkid/81377536", "googlebot-news": "index", "date": "2014-09-15", "Description": "Preparing for the second year of Obamacare enrollment, California unveiled new television ads and handed out $14.6 million to community groups for consumer outreach.
