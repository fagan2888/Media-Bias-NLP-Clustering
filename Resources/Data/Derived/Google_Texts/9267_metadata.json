The track, which features turns and jumps for both beginners and experts, took 25 dump trucks of dirt and about six weeks to construct. It cost about $35,000.\n\n\"A lot of people are interested\" in remote-control racing, Katsoulis said. \"But they used to have to travel two or three hours away to race.\"\n\nSkip Ad Ad Loading... x Embed x Share A crowd of 100 hobbyists turns out on Saturday for the grand opening of Adventure RC Raceway\u2019s indoor track for radio-controlled cars. (Michael Dossett, Special to The Courier-Journal) March 22, 2013\n\nLouisville racer Jesse Snellen travels to Ohio and Indianapolis to race on indoor and outdoor tracks, but says having an indoor track within 20 minutes of his home is a luxury. He said the Adventure RC track is bigger than several he's been to and described its quality as comparable to others in the region. \"It's one of the upper-end tracks,\" he said.\n\nJimmy Vanderharr said he used other tracks around the country as a model when building the Adventure RC track. The course is fraught with jumps and turns and guided by a PVC pipe perimeter. An elevated deck beside the track can hold up to 15 racers as they remotely maneuver their cars.\n\nVanderharr helped construct the track and said it will be reconfigured every six weeks to implement new obstacles and prevent wear and tear.\n\nSaturday's races had more than 100 entries.\n\nAs cars bolted around the course, Brian Dunbar looked on with a smile. It was his first time at a track since retiring from professional racing in 2003. \"I've never seen this many people racing in Louisville,\" he said.\n\nReporter Patrick T.
