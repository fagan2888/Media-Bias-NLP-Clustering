But even though the agency has accepted applications for other drugs seeking to come onto the U.S. market through the 351(k) pathway, it has yet to actually approve any other ones. While many payers are planning their management strategies for these drugs, one industry expert questions the FDA\u2019s subsequent lack of action \u2014 and wonders if this is a sign that biosimilars are one and done in the United States.\n\nWhen the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act passed as part of the Affordable Care Act in 2010, the BPCIA was fairly short on details surrounding the actual biosimilar pathway. Since that time, the FDA has issued various draft and final guidance documents on different aspects of the drugs, with the most recent guidance addressing the long-anticipated naming of biosimilars (SPN 9/15, p. 1).\n\nSome experts have pointed to this uncertainty as a main contributor to the agency\u2019s inaction on biosimilars. However, at a December 2014 conference, Sally Howard, deputy commissioner for policy, planning and legislation for the FDA, said that the six draft guidances the agency had released up to that point should help \u201cthe industry to understand the data they\u2019ll need to submit to demonstrate biosimilarity.\u201d The agency, she said, was of the opinion that \u201cno additional guidance is needed before a product [can be] approved\u201d (SPN 12/14, p. 1). The fact that the FDA is in discussion with multiple manufacturers about their potential biosimilars would seem to support this view (see story, p. 1).\n\nCause of Delays Is Unclear\n\nSo what\u2019s the holdup?\n\nCelltrion, Inc. said in August 2014 that it had completed the filing process for Remsima, a biosimilar version of Remicade (infliximab). But in February 2015, the FDA postponed a scheduled March advisory committee meeting \u201cdue to information requests\u201d (SPN 3/15, p. 8). More than 50 countries have approved the product, with European approval coming in September 2013 (SPN 10/13, p. 5). Celltrion said it had worked with the FDA to conduct clinical trials that would determine Remsima\u2019s bioequivalency to Remicade, including bridging studies that accounted for the almost 40 manufacturing changes that the reference product has undergone since its approval (SPN 3/15, p. 1).\n\nAnd in late 2014, Hospira, Inc. submitted an application for Retacrit, a biosimilar version of epoetin alfa, which is sold in the U.S. as Epogen and Procrit. Pfizer Inc. acquired Hospira in September, and in its third-quarter 2015 earnings call on Oct. 27, Pfizer CEO and Chairman Ian Read said the FDA had issued a complete response letter on the application. \u201cAt this time we do not believe any further clinical trials are needed,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are confident that the additional evidence we provide will support approval.\u201d\n\nAsked about the status of biosimilar applications that the FDA has accepted for review, including those that have passed the 10-month mark without a decision, a spokesperson for the agency\u2019s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research says, \u201cFederal law prohibits us from disclosing information about an existing or potential application. That information is confidential and belongs to the sponsor.\u201d\n\nRetacrit was approved in Europe in 2007 and has \u201ca gazillion patient days of treatment,\u201d points out an industry expert who declines to be identified. The fact that \u201cthe FDA doesn\u2019t want more clinical data\u2026is a problem.\u201d After all, the agency has approved large molecule follow-on biologics such as Omnitrope (somatropin) and more recently Basaglar (insulin glargine) under the 505(b)(2) pathway of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic (FD&C) Act. Both those therapies have been approved as biosimilars in Europe.\n\nThe source tells SPN that because of the FDA\u2019s inaction on biosimilars after the Zarxio approval, that the 351(k) pathway is \u201cmissing and presumed dead\u201d and adds that it seems presumable that the agency may not ever approve any other products through the 351(k) pathway \u2014 although it likely will continue to approve biologic drugs through other pathways that for all intents and purposes are biosimilars. When SPN asked for a comment on this, an FDA spokesperson pointed to the activity within its Biosimilar Product Development Program.\n\n\u201cThe science is there. The issues are not scientific,\u201d says the source. \u201cIn the 505 context,\u2026the FDA is making decisions on the same scientific questions\u201d it\u2019s facing with 351(k) applications. But with the 505 pathway, the FDA doesn\u2019t \u201cfeel quite the political heat\u201d that it does with the newer 351(k) pathway, speculates the source. The BPCIA has a transition period that will shift proteins approved under the FD&C Act to the 351(k) route. But even when the agency unveiled its proposed naming strategy for biosimilars last August, it said it was unsure how it would handle naming of 505 therapies when they transitioned to BPCIA oversight.\n\nThe FDA also has approved generic enoxaparin, reference drug Lovenox, through the traditional generic route of an abbreviated New Drug Application even though it\u2019s a large-molecule biologic (SPN 1/12, p. 1). \u201cEnoxaparin is standing out like a flaming beacon,\u201d maintains the source.\n\n\u201cExclusivity is not the issue,\u201d the source asserts, noting that \u201cpatents are always a bit of a morass.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you look at all this, it\u2019s a perfect storm created by the inability to answer these questions,\u201d says the source, who wonders why the agency has not released guidance on interchangeability. \u201cFDA\u2019s caution is almost a move backwards.\u201d\n\nBut with so much backlash over drug prices, which biosimilars are expected to help bring down, \u201cthis has got to come into the pricing debate at a political level,\u201d says the source.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in for some interesting times\u201d with the \u201cmissing and presumed dead\u201d pathway. \u201cAt what point do we say it\u2019s a problem?\u201d\n\n\u00a9 2016 by Atlantic Information Services, Inc.
