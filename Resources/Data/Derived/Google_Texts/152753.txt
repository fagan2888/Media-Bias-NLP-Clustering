Jindal said “I’m the only candidate running that refused to expand Medicaid. I am the only one that did what we could to fight Obamacare. This is an important point. I appreciate Chris’s nice compliments to me. I love Mary Pat. This is about the most important election in our lifetimes. Folks, a couple years ago, give us the Republican majorities in the House and the Senate, they’d stop Obamacare and amnesty and the bad Iran deal. Nothing changed. if they fooled us once, shame on us, if they fooled us twice, shame on us. I give you participation ribbon and a juice box, it’s about actually cutting government spending, not talking about cutting government spending.”

After the audience groaned, Christie said, “We stopped Obamacare in New Jersey, but here’s the bigger issue, what do you think is going to happen when Hillary Clinton is elected president of the United States? The woman who tried to impose health care on this country over 20 years ago, and she was stopped then by a strong group of Republicans and American public that said no, thank you.”
