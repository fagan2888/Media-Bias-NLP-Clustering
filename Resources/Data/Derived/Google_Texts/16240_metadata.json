They may be just a symptom of the real problem. In order to get better at catching actual threats, the Transportation Security Agency has to reduce the number of travelers it screens. And TSA is undermining its best tool for that job.\n\nOn Monday, the Department of Homeland Security announced that airport screeners failed to detect 95 percent of explosives and weapons that undercover operatives were attempting to pass through security checkpoints. One tester even got a fake bomb past the screeners after the device set off a metal detector. In response, DHS Secretary Jeh Johnson pulled acting TSA chief Melvin Carraway off the job, and announced more random covert testing, more training for airport security personnel, and more random equipment checks. But one thing that DHS should not do is rush to overscreen every single passenger.

Jacobson, a mathematics professor at the University of Illinois who has been doing research on aviation security for more than 20 years and is considered a leading mind in risk-based modeling for aviation. Even DHS has come around to this line of reasoning, and has implemented various programs meant to exempt low-risk passengers from stricter screening.\n\nJacobson says that the \u201cworst thing\u201d that could happen for airport security at this point is to reverse the progress made in this so-called risk-based screening, and instead subject higher numbers of people to screening that doesn\u2019t reflect the likely threat they pose.\n\nToday\u2019s airport security overweighs the risk of items and underweights the risk of dangerous people, he said, simply because the system, as a whole, still doesn\u2019t differentiate those passengers who may pose a threat from those who surely do not.\n\n\u201cUltimately, we\u2019re dealing with people\u2019s intent more than items. Which concerns you more: a person who has no bad intent but who has an item on them like a knife or a gun, or someone who has bad intent but doesn\u2019t have such an item?\u201d he said. \u201cMost people are comfortable with the former rather than the latter. A person with bad intent will find a way to cause damage. A person without bad intent who happens to have an item on them is not the issue.\u201d\n\nRisk-based systems can help solve that problem, but only when used correctly. The most famous and widely used is TSA\u2019s PreCheck, which launched in December 2013. It allows U.S. citizens and permanent residents who submit to a somewhat strict background check (including an in-person meeting and fingerprint scan) to receive expedited screening at airports for five years. Jacobson says the best thing policy-makers could do to airport improve security is get a lot more people into PreCheck.\n\nRelated: Here\u2019s the Secret Criteria the TSA Uses to Spot Terrorists\n\n\u201cThe irony is that if we do less overall screening by putting the right people in PreCheck and the people we don\u2019t know anything about not in PreCheck, the total amount of screening done will be less, the amount of technology we use will be less, and the total security of the system will be greater. It\u2019s completely counterintuitive.\u201d\n\nEnrollment in PreCheck surpassed 1 million subscribers in March. But that\u2019s a far cry from the number that could be eligible. And the more people in the system, the better it works, according to Jacobson, whose research has shown that 60 to 70 percent of the passengers of any particular flight probably should be in the fast lane.\n\nThis is not to say that PreCheck doesn\u2019t have problems. In March, Kenneth Fletcher, TSA\u2019s chief risk officer, told Congress that 13 of 17 recent recommendations to improve the program by the DHS Office of Inspector General, or OIG, were \u201cresolved\u201d but still \u201copen.\u201d\n\nThe big problem, despite the background check, personal travel history testimony and fingerprint scans that PreCheck enrollees submit to, is that DHS still doesn\u2019t have a firm grasp on what differentiates a low-risk and a high-risk human being.\n\n\u201cTSA is working to address the OIG\u2019s recommendations, such as working with the DHS Office of Policy \u2026 to establish a common definition for identifying \u2018lower-risk\u2019 travelers and low-risk trusted travelers across the department for consistency in application across all DHS vetting programs,\u201d Fletcher said.\n\nRelated: The Terrorist Bomb That Keeps TSA Agents Up at Night\n\nBroadly speaking, Jacobson and other aviation security experts consider PreCheck a huge success. It\u2019s given birth to new and more interesting programs (not yet fully implemented) like the Dynamic Aviation Risk Management Systems, or DARMS, which uses incoming information allowing the TSA to quickly move screeners or resources where they are needed, and to develop changing threat profiles of different people or places.\n\nBut more and more people who aren\u2019t in the program are being ushered into PreCheck lines by screeners eager to hurry the process along at the nation\u2019s overcrowded airports. It sounds like an example of poor training for overworked TSA employees \u2014 but it\u2019s actually policy.\n\nTSA calls it \u201cmanaged inclusion.\u201d Christian Beckner explains it in a February 2015 issue brief for the George Washington University Center for Cyber and Homeland Security: \u201cTSA also now uses its Risk Assessment program and a \u2018managed inclusion\u2019 process to bring additional travelers into PreCheck lanes, based either on the results of Secure Flight checks prior to check-in or \u2026\u201d and this is the key part \u2026 \u201cat the discretion of Transportation Security Officers while travelers are queuing at checkpoints, in part based upon how busy the PreCheck lanes are relative to the regular screening lanes.\u201d\n\nBeckner notes that this saves time and money. \u201cAs a cumulative result of all of these efforts, currently around 45 percent of air travelers in the United States (more than 276 million in 2014) are receiving expedited screening. This growth in PreCheck has allowed TSA to reduce its screener workforce, and the agency has estimated that these staffing efficiencies will allow it to save at least $100 million in the current fiscal year.\u201d\n\nBut Jacobsen warns that allowing screeners and passengers to take shortcuts undercuts the entire point of risk-based modeling.\n\nRelated: 10 Outrageous Items Confiscated by TSA in 2014\n\n\u201cRisk-based systems work so long as you stay within the parameters,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you push people into risk-based systems who don\u2019t have the risk profile to validate that they should be in the risk-based systems you are now stretching the system beyond security. \u2026I think that by putting people in PreCheck who don\u2019t belong there, we may be under-screening people. There is a great deal of analytics that goes into getting a security number for each person.\u201d\n\nThe problems with airport security extend beyond TSA. They represent the capabilities and limitations of this moment in history. Humanity has devised a way to ferry people around the world in a day. In order to make sure those people don\u2019t blow up the means of their conveyance, we shoot photons at their luggage and bodies. It\u2019s dumb. Risk-based modeling of passengers represents an improvement, if we would let it get off the ground.\n\nRead More at Defense One:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Yesterday\u2019s headlines \u2014 screeners missed 67 of 70 \u201cweapons\u201d in a test of airpor", "title": "The One Right Way to Solve the TSA Crisis Is Politically Incorrect", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/06/03/One-Right-Way-Solve-TSA-Crisis-Politically-Incorrect", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/06072013_TSA_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/06/03/One-Right-Way-Solve-TSA-Crisis-Politically-Incorrect", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/06072013_TSA_article.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Yesterday\u2019s headlines \u2014 screeners missed 67 of 70 \u201cweapons\u201d in a test of airpor", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca321\"", "article_summary": "There is a great deal of analytics that goes into getting a security number for each person.\u201dThe problems with airport security extend beyond TSA.\nYesterday\u2019s headlines \u2014 screeners missed 67 of 70 \u201cweapons\u201d in a test of airport security \u2014 were another embarrassment for a much-maligned agency.\nOn Monday, the Department of Homeland Security announced that airport screeners failed to detect 95 percent of explosives and weapons that undercover operatives were attempting to pass through security checkpoints.\nJacobson says the best thing policy-makers could do to airport improve security is get a lot more people into PreCheck.\nIn response, DHS Secretary Jeh Johnson pulled acting TSA chief Melvin Carraway off the job, and announced more random covert testing, more training for airport security personnel, and more random equipment checks."}
