Obamacare is like rape? Really? Do they have any idea how offensive this is coming from a party of rape enthusiasts? No, probably not. They don\u2019t think over-the-top racism is offensive either.\n\nHell. They don\u2019t even think there is any racism. Rosa Parks destroyed it like a black Beowulf rising from the mists of Montgomery, Alabama.\n\nOh, that\u2019s right. These signs must be imaginary. There is no racism, is there? What was I thinking, letting reality intrude on fantasy?\n\nObamacare is working, including nearly a million hits on Monday, as Justin Baragona reported here this morning, and they are more unpopular than ever, less relevant than ever, under attack by so-called establishment Republicans including the Chamber of Commerce (not just locally but nationally), the tea party is lashing out with ever more nonsensical attacks at everyone and everything around them.\n\nIt\u2019s a good time. Buy popcorn. Relax and enjoy.\n\nCausing a government shutdown alarmed their corporate sponsors you see. \u201cGroups calling for default are clearly less interested in the Main Street concerns of business large and small,\u201d said the Chamber of Commerce\u2019s Bruce Josten, the group\u2019s executive vice president for government affairs.\n\nReap what you sow, Paul said in Galatians 6:7-9.\n\nOh, and speaking of Jesus and causation\u2026\n\nFor repeating Jesus\u2019 message, one Tea Partier is saying Pope Francis is making Jesus cry. \u201cJesus Christ is weeping in Heaven,\u201d says Virginia tea partier Jonathan Moseley. Probably for joy but whatever. Moseley clearly has the same issues with understanding the Bible as does David Barton. Probably uses the David Barton Translation.\n\nAnd you thought the King James Version was bad.\n\nYeah, about that.\n\nMoseley argued on World Net Daily that,\n\nFrancis argues for dependence upon government to redistribute wealth. And con artists in the U.S. are seizing on the opportunity to spread the misery of socialism. Rush Limbaugh and Sarah Palin this week called Pope Francis on his mangling of economics. Then author Reza Aslan struck back in the Washington Post, claiming that Jesus was a socialist.\n\n(I don\u2019t know: I don\u2019t think this is so bad. After all, because Pope Francis is just echoing Jesus\u2019 own words, Rush Limbaugh called Jesus a Marxist.)\n\n\u201cBut we have to define our terms,\u201d cautions the tea partier, who then proceeds to define socialism as \u201ctheft\u201d (get off our Interstate system and stay out of our libraries then, Mr. Moseley). He says he rejects \u201ccrony capitalism\u201d while welcoming it with both arms. After all, without crony capitalism and the threat liberalism poses to it, there would be no need for a tea party at all.\n\nHe says,\n\nFrancis blames poverty and unequal wealth on \u201cideologies which defend the absolute autonomy of the marketplace and financial speculation.\u201d But there was also poverty in Jesus\u2019 day, when government tightly regulated the economy.\n\nActually \u2013 and here we see influences of David Barton once more \u2013 the ancient economy of Jesus\u2019 day was neither tightly controlled nor regulated. Cities in the Roman empire were all but independent entities and capitalism ran rampant. The Romans no more controlled Jerusalem\u2019s economy than they did that of any other city. They barely had a presence there at all out of respect for Jewish religious sensibilities and the Roman governor had his headquarters in the Gentile city of Caesarea, on the coast.\n\nAnother tea partier, North Carolina\u2019s Brooke McGowan, wants us to believe that Wiccans are going to cause invasion and destruction. Well, not just Wiccans, of course, but their nefarious allies, atheists and Muslims.\n\nWiccans and atheists and Muslims oh my!\n\nIn this nation we have turned away from the God of the Bible, and we\u2019ve told Him He\u2019s simply not welcome here. We have welcomed pluralism, atheism, secular humanism, Wicca, and even Islam, but we\u2019ve told the Holy God to stay away. Legally, we removed God from the public schools over 50 years ago, and then 40 years ago through a court of nine justices, though not unanimous, we determined that His very image, precious life in the womb, could now be legally torn apart, killed, and discarded. Legalized murder began our rapid moral downfall\u2026.Now, how can we expect as a nation to stay blessed or even prosper when we willingly stay under this curse?\n\nBut what can you expect out of a Larry Klayman rally? Really, your expectations are too high.\n\nOh, and speaking of low expectations, Rick Santorum isn\u2019t happy that Republicans are signing up for Obamacare. Apparently, they\u2019re old and sick\u2026and you know, icky. But Mr. Santorum has not thought this through (I know, a shock): The older people he is upset about, after all, represent the GOP\u2019s base.\n\nHow dare they want to live on his dime!\n\nThings are falling apart all around them; their fantasies are disintegrating for all to see and the result is that as they become more desperate for their fantasies to be true they become more strident, as eager to convince themselves as us.\n\nIt\u2019s a truly sad spectacle but a not unentertaining one. As we go forward to 2014, and then 2016, and as Obamacare takes hold and becomes almost commonplace, the spectacle is sure to become even more outrageous as heads begin to explode like overripe tomatoes.\n\nThe tea party is the intersection of cognitive dissonance and reality. It\u2019s certain to become a reality show. Oh wait \u2013 it already is. But never mind, tea party, we awful liberals have some issues for your tissues. Hang in there while we dry our eyes from tears of laughter.\n\nImage from The Bullshit Observer\n\nUpdated [11:18 3 December 2013]: To reflect Justin Baragona\u2019s post", "article_metadata": {"description": "The tea party is the intersection of cognitive dissonance and reality.
