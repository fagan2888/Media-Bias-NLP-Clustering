Recovery operations began again Saturday morning after being suspended Friday night due to weather conditions.

Responders continue to focus on collecting human remains and debris from the helicopter along the shoreline and in the debris fields around the accident site.

"We will continue our recovery efforts as needed to ensure we collect as many human remains as possible," said Andy Bourland, director of public affairs, Eglin AFB.

The largest sections of the helicopter have been extracted from the Santa Rosa Sound and are in the process of being collected on land for transfer to Hurlburt Field for review by the investigation teams that have already arrived and begun their work.

Eglin officials anticipate emergency recovery actions will conclude sometime late Saturday evening. Once these actions are completed, recovery operations will continue and will eventually transition to the Safety Investigation Board, which is already on site. That effort is being headed by the U.S. Army Combat Readiness Center out of Fort Rucker, Alabama.
