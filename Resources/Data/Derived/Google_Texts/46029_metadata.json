Now, for the first time in 14 years, it\u2019s happened nine months in a row. It wasn\u2019t that long ago when we desperately hoped the economy would be strong enough to create 200,000 jobs a month. Now, for the first time in 14 years, it\u2019s happened nine months in a row.\n\nThe new report from Bureau of Labor Statistics shows the U.S. economy added 214,000 jobs in October. The overall unemployment rate also dropped a little more to 5.8% \u2013 the lowest since July 2008, which was over six years ago.\n\nOnce again, public-sector layoffs did not drag down the overall employment figures. Though jobs reports over the last few years have shown monthly government job losses, in October, the private sector added 209,000 while the public sector added 5,000. The latter may not sound like much, but after several years in which that total was negative, it\u2019s at least somewhat heartening.\n\nAs for the revisions, all of the news was positive: August\u2019s totals were revised up from 180,000 to 203,000, while September\u2019s figures were revised up, from 248,000 to 256,000. Combined, that\u2019s an additional 31,000 jobs.\n\nFor the right, which is still under the illusion that President Obama\u2019s tax breaks and health care law are destroying the economy, this is yet another jobs report that will be very difficult to explain.\n\nAll told, over the last 12 months, the U.S. economy has added over 2.64 million jobs overall and 2.58 million in the private sector. What\u2019s more, October was the 56th consecutive month in which we\u2019ve seen private-sector job growth \u2013 the longest on record.\n\nAt this point, with the calendar year nearly over, 2014 is still very much on track to be the best year for U.S. job creation since 1999.\n\nAbove you\u2019ll find the chart I run every month, showing monthly job losses since the start of the Great Recession. The image makes a distinction \u2013 red columns point to monthly job totals under the Bush administration, while blue columns point to job totals under the Obama administration.\n\nUpdate: Here\u2019s another chart, this one showing monthly job losses/gains in just the private sector since the start of the Great Recession.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "It wasn't long ago when we desperately hoped the economy would be strong enough to create 200,000 jobs a month.
