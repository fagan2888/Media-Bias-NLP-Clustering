A 2015 issue brief on the 2014 Commonwealth Fund Biennial Health Insurance Survey revealed that 23% of adults aged 19 to 64 were underinsured\u2014that\u2019s almost twice the 2013 rate.1\n\n\n\nOur experience at the Patient Access Network (PAN) Foundation, an independent, national charitable organization that assists federally and commercially insured individuals living with chronic, critical, and rare diseases with the out-of-pocket costs for their prescribed medications, coincides with this finding. We have seen steady growth in patients\u2019 need for financial assistance with the out-of-pocket costs of their medical treatments. In 2013, we assisted 99,271 patients, and in 2015, we assisted 364,385 patients\u2014a 267% increase in just 2 years. Further, the amount of assistance PAN provides to individual patients has nearly doubled in the last 2 years.\n\n\n\nIn light of these trends, last year PAN forged a partnership with The American Journal of Managed Care and launched the \u201cPAN Challenge: Balancing Moral Hazard, Affordability and Access to Critical Therapies in the Age of Cost Sharing\u201d\u2014a call for papers to find solutions for the millions of Americans with life-threatening, chronic, or rare diseases who may not be able to access critical medications because they cannot afford the deductibles, co-pays, and coinsurance required by their health plans.\n\n\n\nThe competition sought innovative and sustainable strategies for cost sharing to reduce inequality and promote access, affordability, and adherence to treatment for 2 population categories: Medicare beneficiaries and the commercially insured. We asked that papers address 2 questions: 1) How does federal policy regarding healthcare cost sharing (eg, deductibles, co-pays, coinsurance, out-of-pocket limits) affect the ability of individuals with chronic and rare diseases to have affordable access to critical therapies? 2) What policy solutions are likely to improve access to critical therapies for individuals with chronic and rare diseases?\n\n\n\nWe are grateful for the numerous case studies we received from various organizations and the papers we received from researchers and academic institutions. The winning papers and case studies are featured in full in this supplement. We hope that these papers will stimulate a dialog about how to ease the financial burden and improve the quality of life for millions of patients and their families.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "PAN, Patient Access Network Foundation, PAN Challenge, financial burden, quality of life, case study,", "og": {"site_name": "AJMC", "image": "https://ajmc.s3.amazonaws.com/_media/_core/ajmc-twitter-logo.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "This supplement showcases the winning papers and case studies from the PAN Challenge, which aimed to stimulate a dialogue about how to ease the financial burden and improve the quality of life for millions of patients and their families.", "title": "An Introduction to the Patient Access Network Foundation and <i>AJMC</i> Collaborative Supplement"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://ajmc.s3.amazonaws.com/_media/_core/ajmc-twitter-logo.jpg", "title": "An Introduction to the Patient Access Network Foundation and <i>AJMC</i> Collaborative Supplement", "description": "This supplement showcases the winning papers and case studies from the PAN Challenge, which aimed to stimulate a dialogue about how to ease the financial burden and improve the quality of life for millions of patients and their families.", "card": "summary", "site": "@AJMC_Journal"}, "description": "This supplement showcases the winning papers and case studies from the PAN Challenge, which aimed to stimulate a dialogue about how to ease the financial burden and improve the quality of life for millions of patients and their families."}, "article_summary": "2) What policy solutions are likely to improve access to critical therapies for individuals with chronic and rare diseases?\nWe have seen steady growth in patients\u2019 need for financial assistance with the out-of-pocket costs of their medical treatments.\nFurther, the amount of assistance PAN provides to individual patients has nearly doubled in the last 2 years.\nThe winning papers and case studies are featured in full in this supplement.\nIn 2013, we assisted 99,271 patients, and in 2015, we assisted 364,385 patients\u2014a 267% increase in just 2 years."}
