She gets paid $6,000 for playing a six-month season and when extrapolated over a 12-month period, Thompson earns only slightly more than what is considered the poverty level in the United States.\n\nFor Thompson, this means living frugally to play the game she loves. From March through August, she lives with a host family, sharing a bedroom and bathroom with one of her teammates, Kendall Johnson.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like a hotel room, except a little bit smaller,\u201d Thompson said. They share a closet, but half of it is filled with the host family\u2019s items. Thompson and Johnson buy their own groceries and cook their own meals rather than eat out. They also share a Ford Focus provided by the team. But, they have to pay for their own gas. Practice is 30 minutes away and the game field is 45 minutes away. \u201cIt\u2019s also hard to plan around each other\u2019s schedule,\u201d Johnson said.\n\nIn the past dozen years, there have been two attempts at a U.S. women\u2019s professional soccer league. The Women\u2019s United Soccer Association started in 1999, riding off the Women\u2019s World Cup high after the U.S. claimed gold. The second league, Women\u2019s Professional Soccer, started in 2009. Both leagues folded after three seasons.\n\n\u201cThe WUSA and WPS went a little big on salaries and the way we traveled,\u201d said Christie Rampone, 38, captain of the U.S. women\u2019s soccer team. She also is a 17-year national team member and played in all three leagues. \u201cWe lost a lot of money quick.\u201d\n\nIn 2013, the NWSL was launched with a more conservative business plan.\n\n\u201cWith women\u2019s sports, whenever you are going to start something new, while there were two leagues before us, those that want to be part of this journey are going to have to take a little bit of a step back,\u201d Cheryl Bailey, NWSL executive director, said in an interview with NBC Sports.\n\nTo help the new league endure, the U.S., Canadian and Mexican soccer federations have agreed to subsidize their national team players allocated to each of the NWSL teams. A $200,000 team salary cap is divided among the remaining players with salaries ranging from $6,000 to $30,000.\n\nWithout a cap in the past, teams would pay world-class players such as Brazil\u2019s Marta $500,000 a season. Two out of the three American professional teams Marta played for folded. Although the NWSL can\u2019t afford to draw top international players to raise the quality of play, this leaves an opportunity for American players. Many young players make up the 180-player league.\n\n\u201cThe play is mixed a little bit,\u201d Rampone said of the NWSL talent. \u201cThere are ups and downs. We\u2019re missing some of the big names. But it\u2019s actually helping sustain the league right now. We\u2019re in a good place.\u201d\n\nAnother priority for the NWSL is increasing its fan base. Nine clubs were chosen and each are in major cities \u2014 except for Los Angeles \u2014 including the Boston Breakers, Chicago Red Stars, Houston Dash, FC Kansas City, Portland Thorns, Seattle Reign, FC Sky Blue in New Jersey, Western New York Flash and Washington D.C. Spirit. According to Equalizer Soccer, a news site dedicated to women\u2019s professional soccer, last season\u2019s average attendance was 4,271. Most of the fans are families with girls who play soccer. \u201cDemographic-wise \u2026 we can\u2019t just have 12-year-old girls,\u201d Sky Blue assistant coach Jay Cooney said. With limited marketing budgets, drawing a wider crowd has been challenging.\n\nThompson, 23, a recent Stanford graduate, joined Sky Blue in the NWSL\u2019s inaugural season. She signed a one-year contract with a team option. If the team acts upon the extension, they will give her an automatic 10-percent raise the next season.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to save for the future,\u201d Thompson said. She has to rely on her parents for financial support. \u201cNot only do we work for only six months, but not a lot of people are making a substantial amount of money. It can\u2019t carry over.\u201d\n\nMany players have second jobs to subsidize their six-month soccer salaries. Johnson coaches private lessons for youth girl soccer players. But even this is challenging as there is no set practice schedule, her transportation is limiting and Sky Blue travels often.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s always in the back of my mind if it would be worth it,\u201d Thompson said, of spending money on things other than basic essentials. Thompson is the only player on her team with a second job year-round outside of the soccer world. She is an East Coast representative for her family friends\u2019 farm, Stahlbush Island Farms. It is an environmentally friendly farm and food processor located in her hometown in Oregon. \u201cIt\u2019s super flexible,\u201d Thompson said. She is able to get in six hours a week.\n\nThe league\u2019s tight budget puts teams in obscure venues away from population hubs. Some are turf football fields as opposed to preferred soccer-specific grass fields. Sky Blue plays in central New Jersey at Rutgers University \u2014 \u201cin the middle of nowhere,\u201d Thompson said. The team takes seven-hour bus trips or early morning flights the day before a game instead of traveling early to adjust to the new time zones. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t fully feel necessarily professional in the sense that we don\u2019t have resources the way I see other men\u2019s professional teams have,\u201d Johnson said. In fact, some players are \u201ctaking a step down from their college facilities,\u201d Rampone said. \u201cIt\u2019s something you have to be professional about as a player and do the best you can.\u201d\n\nFor many, the second year is crucial. Players will decide to continue to play for the low salary or pursue another career. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to lose players like Maddie and Kendall because of the low salary,\u201d Rampone said. \u201cThis [Maddie and Kendall] is sustainability.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn year three, you start to lose players,\u201d Rampone said. \u201cThe first year, you have your rookie year and the second year you\u2019re still digesting it all in. But, in the third year, it\u2019s more of a decision-taking time.\u201d\n\nIn the off-season, Rampone suggested the players who aren\u2019t playing year-round with a national team to continue working for their teams off the field. The NWSL uses free marketing tools such as social media, but many people still don\u2019t know about the league. With the exception of the Portland and Houston teams, which have the support of their Major League Soccer teams, there is low attendance. The Portland Thorns draws more than 13,000 fans per game while the Chicago Red Stars draws less than 2,000.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to do a little thinking outside the box,\u201d Rampone said. \u201cThey can brainstorm throughout the off-season of how to draw more fans and get the name out there. It\u2019s a win-win situation.\u201d\n\nThompson is hopeful and willing to make the financial sacrifices to see the league succeed. \u201cI really do think that this league will work and I hope it can be a foundation for women in sports,\u201d she said. \u201cIt would be cool to be a part of that.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the only time in my life my body can do it. It\u2019s kind of a \u2018why not\u2019 situation,\u201d Thompson said.\n\n\u201cThese are the pioneers of putting in time and effort while getting little money,\u201d Rampone said. \u201cThese girls are not playing for paychecks, but playing for the love and passion for it.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Kasey Quon,Maddie Thompson,National Women\u2019s Soccer League,professional soccer,Sky Blue FC,soccer,Sports,women\u2019s soccer,Features,Culture & Features,Frontpage Featured", "description": "Maddie Thompson, a pro soccer player in the two-year-old National Women\u2019s Soccer League, plays for Sky Blue FC in New Jersey and is an example of a pro living\u2026", "generator": "WordPress 3.5", "robots": "noodp,noydir"}, "article_summary": "In the past dozen years, there have been two attempts at a U.S. women\u2019s professional soccer league.\nAccording to Equalizer Soccer, a news site dedicated to women\u2019s professional soccer, last season\u2019s average attendance was 4,271.\nMaddie Thompson, a professional soccer player in the two-year-old National Women\u2019s Soccer League, plays for Sky Blue FC in New Jersey.\nThe second league, Women\u2019s Professional Soccer, started in 2009.\nWith the exception of the Portland and Houston teams, which have the support of their Major League Soccer teams, there is low attendance."}
