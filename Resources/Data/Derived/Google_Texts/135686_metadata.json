Aaron Bean (R-Fernandina Beach) pointed out Monday, during the bill\u2019s first hearing this year in the Senate Health Policy Committee\u2014the panel he chairs.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re thinking we\u2019ve seen this bill before, we have. It indeed has passed this committee last year\u2014I think for the last two years. Isn\u2019t that correct, Senator Braynon,\u201d asked Bean, during the hearing.\n\nThat\u2019s correct,\u201d Sen. Oscar Braynon replied.\n\nThe Miami Gardens Democrat is the bill\u2019s Senate sponsor\u2014who\u2019s been working to pass the bill for three years. He says the measure establishing a needle exchange pilot program in Miami-Dade comes with a change. And, no state funds would be needed.\n\n\u201cYup, there\u2019s been one change that we made last year at the suggestion of the Surgeon General,\u201d Braynon continued. \u201cIt was run by Jackson Health System and the Health Department. Now, it will be run by the University of Miami to establish this program. Other than that, it\u2019s the same bill.\u201d\n\nWith the aim of reducing the transmittal of HIV/AIDS, the pilot would allow drug users to exchange used needles for clean syringes.\n\nThe measure has several backers, including Florida Public Health Association, AIDS Institute, Florida Hospital and Medical Associations.\n\nPhillip Zegelboe representing the Florida Medical Association is now a third year Medical student at the University of South Florida College of medicine. Born and raised in Hollywood, Florida, he says he remembers spending much of his childhood in Broward and Dade Counties.\n\n\u201cI can remember seeing from my school bus window, seeing intravenous drug users abusing drugs in the bushes,\u201d said Zegelboe, during a House hearing earlier this month. \u201cAnd, this was way back when. As recently as 2013, things have gotten much worse with the National Institute of Drug Abuse classifying the heroin outbreak in Miami Dade County as an epidemic. Miami is at the intersection of drug abuse and an infectious disease epidemic. HIV-Instance in Miami is the highest in the country where over 2,000 injection drug users\u2014a fifth of them with HIV and a third of them with Hepatitis C.\u201d\n\nHe spoke during the bill\u2019s first House hearing, which passed on the second day of session.\n\n\u201cJackson Memorial Hospital in Miami has a staff analysis that\u2019s been performed that assesses that 10 percent of the intravenous drug users could avoid an infection with this bill\u2014which would save our state about 124 million in treatment costs,\u201d added Zegelboe.\n\nAnother backer of the bill is Rep. Bobby Dubose (D-Fort Lauderdale).\n\n\u201cWith this particular pilot program\u2014and I think there\u2019s over 30 states that\u2019s already on board with doing something similar\u2014and being that South Florida is number one and number two in the nation, I think that we\u2019re kind of behind the curveball with this, and we need to get up to speed,\u201d said Dubose.\n\nWhile the measure passed the House Healthy Quality Subcommittee on the second day of session, it did get some opposing votes. The measure\u2019s House sponsor is Rep. Katie Edwards (D-Plantation), who had some words to say to those dissenters.\n\n\u201cI would bend over backwards and do everything I can to make sure that no family has to experience what mine has, when it comes to addiction,\u201d said Edwards, holding back tears. \u201cSo, I take it very personal to my colleagues who are in my peer group that don\u2019t get that this is still a very pertinent, very personal issues to thousands of families across this state. Let\u2019s not pretend that there isn\u2019t an epidemic.\u201d\n\nRep. Representative Matt Gaetz (R-Fort Walton Beach) was among the two opposing votes, questioning whether the bill prohibits county money from going towards the program as it does state funds.\n\nFor more news updates, follow Sascha Cordner on Twitter: @SaschaCordner.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"category": "HNF Stories", "description": "A bill establishing a needle exchange pilot program in South Florida to help reduce HIV/AIDS is now starting to move in both chambers of the Legislature,", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://health.wusf.usf.edu/post/bill-creating-needle-exchange-pilot-program-passes-first-senate-panel", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/shared/npr/styles/medium/nprshared/201503/394926075.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "A bill establishing a needle exchange pilot program in South Florida to help reduce HIV/AIDS is now starting to move in both chambers of the Legislature,", "title": "Bill Creating Needle Exchange Pilot Program Passes First Senate Panel"}, "story_id": 394926043, "twitter": {"site": "@HealthNewsFL", "card": "summary", "creator": "@HealthNewsFL"}, "author": "Sascha Cordner", "org_id": 390, "dc": {"title": "Bill Creating Needle Exchange Pilot Program Passes First Senate Panel"}, "nid": 10030, "datePublished": "2015-03-24", "keywords": "needle exchange, Florida Legislature 2015", "wordCount": 812, "has_audio": 1, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde529\"", "article_summary": "He says the measure establishing a needle exchange pilot program in Miami-Dade comes with a change.\nA bill establishing a needle exchange pilot program in South Florida to help reduce HIV/AIDS is now starting to move in both chambers of the Legislature, after passing its first Senate committee Monday.\nThe Miami Gardens Democrat is the bill\u2019s Senate sponsor\u2014who\u2019s been working to pass the bill for three years.\nThe measure has several backers, including Florida Public Health Association, AIDS Institute, Florida Hospital and Medical Associations.\nWhile the measure passed the House Healthy Quality Subcommittee on the second day of session, it did get some opposing votes."}
