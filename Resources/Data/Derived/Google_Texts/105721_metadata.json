Ryan has also said the GOP will put forth a plan for replacing the ACA, but did not offer specifics.\n\n\n\nThe bill's passage is symbolic for Republicans, who have previously voted 62 times on ACA repeals that could not pass both chambers. Wednesday's vote will allow many Republicans to fill a campaign promise and could offer a glimpse of how healthcare could be managed if a Republican wins the White House in November.\n\n\n\n\u201cHouse Republicans are starting 2016 unified in opposition to this law and focused on putting together a patient-centered alternative that grants Americans freedom in their health care choices,\u201d Ryan said in a statement.\n\n\n\nThe law needed final approval in the House because it was tweaked in the Senate, which used the budget reconciliation process to push the bill through with only a simple majority vote.\n\n\n\nIt would zero out the penalties for not buying health insurance and eventually scrap the law's Medicaid expansion and premium subsidies. It would also suspend federal money to Planned Parenthood for a year.\n\n\n\nA perennial target of conservatives, the group came under intensified GOP pressure last year over providing fetal tissue for research.\n\n\n\nPlanned Parenthood officials and Democratic lawmakers accused Republicans of attacking women's health. Republicans, in turn, took to the House floor to critique Planned Parenthood in graphic terms, accusing the group of killing babies.\n\n\n\nThe ACA took a hit recently when the yearend omnibus agreement included a delay of the Cadillac tax on high-end insurance plans and the annual tax on insurance providers while also suspending the medical-device tax. Most observers doubt that any of these taxes will ever be reinstated in their current form.\n\nRelated content", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#0a365e", "description": "Republicans in Congress have achieved their longtime goal of sending a bill repealing the Affordable Care Act to President Barack Obama, who is certain to veto it.", "title": "House passes ACA repeal", "og": {"site_name": "Modern Healthcare", "description": "Republicans in Congress have achieved their longtime goal of sending a bill repealing the Affordable Care Act to President Barack Obama, who is certain to veto it.", "title": "House passes ACA repeal", "url": "http://www.modernhealthcare.com/article/20160106/NEWS/160109933", "image": "http://www.modernhealthcare.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/CH/20160106/NEWS/160109933/AR/0/House-Speaker-Paul-Ryan.jpg&maxw=1200&maxh=630", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "http://www.modernhealthcare.com", "description": "Republicans in Congress have achieved their longtime goal of sending a bill repealing the Affordable Care Act to President Barack Obama, who is certain to veto it.", "title": "House passes ACA repeal", "image": "http://www.modernhealthcare.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/CH/20160106/NEWS/160109933/AR/0/House-Speaker-Paul-Ryan.jpg&imageversion=thumbnail&maxw=240&maxh=240", "creator": "@modrnhealthcr", "site": "@modrnhealthcr", "card": "summary"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Modern Healthcare", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "url": "http://www.modernhealthcare.com/article/20160106/NEWS/160109933", "published_at": "2016-01-06", "msapplication-TileImage": "https:/raw.githubusercontent.com/modernhealthcare/mh-logo/master/ms-touch-icon-144x144-precomposed.png", "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "image": "http://www.modernhealthcare.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/CH/20160106/NEWS/160109933/AR/0/House-Speaker-Paul-Ryan.jpg&maxw=360&maxh=240", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8dac\"", "article_summary": "It would zero out the penalties for not buying health insurance and eventually scrap the law's Medicaid expansion and premium subsidies.\nA perennial target of conservatives, the group came under intensified GOP pressure last year over providing fetal tissue for research.\nThe House Wednesday evening passed the bill 240-181, with representatives almost entirely voting along party lines.\nRyan has also said the GOP will put forth a plan for replacing the ACA, but did not offer specifics.\nRepublicans, in turn, took to the House floor to critique Planned Parenthood in graphic terms, accusing the group of killing babies."}
