Funk legend Bernie Worrell is sick, buy this David Byrne remix to help pay his medical bills

Bernie Worrell -- a "lynchpin" of Parliament Funkadelic whose collaborations with Talking Heads made the sound of Stop Making Sense -- is ill and can't afford his medical bills.

Talking Heads frontman David Byrne and Super Collider's Jamie Liddell produced a pair of remixes of Worrell's "How Does the Brainwave" that they're selling to benefit Worrell's medical fund.

I just kicked in.

All proceeds go to the Bernie Worrell branch of Sweet Relief—an organization that helps musicians with their medical needs. Music Glue is also donating their usual fee to the Sweet Relief fund, so when you make your purchase, they will cover their transaction fees (the cost of doing business) but the rest of the money is really, truly going directly to Bernie!! In a better world, we shouldn’t feel the need to do this. Obamacare is a step, but the U.S. health system needs fixing bigtime. Relative to all the industrialized countries of the world, the U.S. remains the only country without universal coverage AND it’s the most expensive.

KEEP ON FUNKIN’ [David Byrne]
