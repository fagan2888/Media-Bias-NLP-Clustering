It is unregulated and has proved to be often frustrating and sometimes dangerous, as the shootings by an Uber driver last month in Michigan sadly proved.\n\nUber\u2019s \"surge\" pricing late at night or during high-demand hours raises rates far above what consumers are satisfied to pay. Some are worried that the easy hiring requirements \u2014 a clean car and an approved application \u2014 open the door to less qualified drivers and therefore more dangerous rides.\n\nRelated Content HealthZette Why Merit Pay Will Permeate Health Care While some fear the change, others perceive lower costs and far better patient outcomes\n\nIronically, it may be Obamacare that is opening the door to an Uber type of model that would disrupt traditional health care.\n\nAs a tidal wave of newly insured patients surge to doctors\u2019 offices, it may become difficult to see the doctor when ill, or even for routine check-ups. The Association of American Medical Colleges estimates there will be a shortage of some 91,500 doctors by 2020 as Obamacare insurance coverage provisions are implemented and 30 million Americans become eligible for health insurance coverage.\n\nTess Timothy, writing in response to an article about concierge care on thehappymd.com, said, \"I am a single mother, self-employed and have gone without health care coverage since I left corporate America (so that I could create a schedule to raise my children). Today being the final day to sign up for Obamacare, I was told today I make too little to get the tax credit \u2026 yet I make too much to qualify for Medicaid! I am so very frustrated, stuck in some health care gap gray area that makes no sense!\"\n\nTimothy said she was open to a new model of health care and finished her comments with: \"I look forward to some drastic changes to our broken system and encourage physicians to adapt to the needs of our nation.\"\n\nRelated Content HealthZette More Money Equals Better Health Care? Really? Meaningful physician input needs to occur when we revamp our system\n\nUsing Silicon Valley-style innovation and attracting willing investors, services such as Heal summon a doctor to a customer\u2019s home via an app. Heal launched in February 2015, and that same year raised $6.5 million from investors, including Qualcomm Executive Chairman Paul Jacobs, United Talent Agency Managing Director Jay Sures, and even entertainer Lionel Richie.\n\nCalifornia-based Heal offers a network of 100 doctors in Los Angeles County, Orange County, San Francisco and Silicon Valley, and offers house calls at a flat rate of $99 per patient. On its website, the group entices potential patients with, \"Right to your door. To your home, office, hotel \u2014 literally wherever you are.\"\n\nAddressing the insurance factor, Heal states on its website, \"Most Anthem and Blue Shield PPO members pay no more for a Heal house call than a typical office visit co-pay. Everyone else pays Heal's $99 flat fee.\"\n\nBut can health care really be compared to hailing a ride under the Uber model?\n\nNot always.\n\nRelated Content HealthZette The Winners and Losers in Health Care Just guess, guess whose pockets were lined, and who lost big time because of Obamacare\n\n\"The range of what these professionals can offer at home is somewhat limited,\" said Michael Hiltzik, writing in the Los Angeles Times. \"You\u2019re not going to arrange a Pager or Heal appointment for anything that looks like, say, a cardiac event. Kidney stone with a pain rating of 10 out of 10? You want to be at the hospital.\"\n\nWhile most Americans still use the traditional health model \u2014 calling the doctor, setting up an appointment, receiving care at an office \u2014 new technology and new delivery models for all facets of health care are challenging the status quo. 23andMe, a $1.1 billion dollar company, empowers patients to formulate their own disease-screening strategies, for example.\n\n\"Uber\u2019s message for health care is clear,\" wrote the New England Journal of Medicine. \"Providers have three choices: Ignore innovators and hope for the best; call for increasing regulation to make it harder for innovators to enter the market; or compete on quality and efficiency, disruptive though that might be.
