Now, companies that sell medical devices won\u2019t pay that tax on products sold between Jan. 1, 2016, and Dec. 31, 2017, according to the Colorado Bioscience Association.\n\n\u201cThis kind of innovation should be encouraged, and today\u2019s vote is an important step to support medical breakthroughs in our state and across the country,\u201d April Giles, the association\u2019s CEO, said in a statement last month praising the pause in the tax.\n\nRyan Mettetal samples smooth and Sharklet surfaces with bacteria to see how much bacteria will stick to each on Tuesday Jan. 05, 2016 at FRA Building.

By their nature, many of the companies have yet to turn a significant profit, and few are the sorts of established bioscience companies that have already had success bringing their product to market.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard in an area where you are fostering startups and growth companies and trying to get those companies out to the market with commercial products,\u201d Giles said.\n\nAt Sharklet Technologies, one of those Fitzsimons-based companies that has yet to take their medical devices to market, CEO Mark Spiecker said the tax made investors leery of supporting start-up companies because they knew a chunk of their investment would go toward the tax as opposed to the company\u2019s future profitability.\n\n\u201cInvestors point to different kinds of regulatory uncertainties as reasons why they wouldn\u2019t want to invest,\u201d he said.\n\nThat\u2019s especially tough for new companies who already face an industry that often costs about $10 million to $15 million in research and development costs just to get a product to market.\n\nSpiecker, whose company is developing a shark-skin like material for medical equipment that is difficult for bacteria to attach to, said he hopes the pause in the tax will mean some investors who shied away from the industry will be willing to consider it again.\n\n\u201cI think it will bring some people back into the game,\u201d he said.\n\nGiles said beyond trouble luring investors, it\u2019s tough to say what the tangible effects of the tax have been on local companies.\n\nBioscience companies tend to be quiet about \u201ccompetitive intelligence\u201d like hiring and spending figures, she said.\n\nBut, Giles said, she has heard of companies that slowed down spending on research and development because of the tax and subsequent lack of investment, and companies that slowed their employment growth due to it.\n\nAlong with the pause in the device tax, the budget deal also made permanent a tax credit for research and development. Giles said the pause in the tax and knowing the research and development credit will be permanent will lead to a spike in research and development in the coming months.\n\n\u201cCompanies will certainly begin to invest slowly in their R and D infrastructure,\u201d she said.\n\nStill, the device tax hasn\u2019t gone away completely and is scheduled to return on products sold in 2018. Giles said she expects the lobbying effort that lead to the tax\u2019s pause will continue until it is fully repealed.\n\n\u201cCompanies are always going to be skeptical until there is full repeal,\u201d she said.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Aurora Sentinel", "description": "The budget deal lawmakers passed in mid-December included a two-year pause in the 2.3-percent tax levied on sales of medical devices", "title": "Device tax delay a relief for bio firms - Aurora Sentinel", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 1000, "identifier": "http://www.aurorasentinel.com/asuplads/AS.MedDevTax2469.010716.jpg", "height": 667}, "updated_time": "2016-01-06T16:53:16-06:00", "url": "http://www.aurorasentinel.com/guide/device-tax-delay-a-relief-for-bio-firms/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/theaurorasentinel", "section": "Anschutz and Healthcare", "tag": "sharklet technologies", "published_time": "2016-01-06T15:59:28-06:00", "modified_time": "2016-01-06T16:53:16-06:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes"}, "article_summary": "A tax on medical devices included in the Affordable Care Act has long been one of the law\u2019s least-popular elements among Colorado\u2019s bioscience firms.\nAlong with the pause in the device tax, the budget deal also made permanent a tax credit for research and development.\nThe state\u00d5s bioscience industry applauded last month\u00d5s move by Congress to pause an unpopular tax on medical devices.\nThe budget deal lawmakers passed in mid-December included a two-year pause in the 2.3-percent tax levied on sales of medical devices.\nBioscience companies tend to be quiet about \u201ccompetitive intelligence\u201d like hiring and spending figures, she said."}
