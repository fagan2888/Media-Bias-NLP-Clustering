Obama\u2019s former Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta ripped the president last year for doing damage to U.S. credibility.\n\n\u201cWhen the President of the United States draws a red line, the credibility of this country is dependent on him backing up his word,\u201d Panetta said. \u201cWhen we draw a line and we give our word, damn it, we back it up.\u201d\n\nFormer U.S. Ambassador to Syria Robert Ford said he resigned his post earlier this year because of the administration\u2019s persistent failure to address root causes of the conflict.\n\n\u201cI was no longer in a position where I felt I could defend the American policy,\u201d Ford said.\n\nThen there\u2019s Obamacare, which was called a potential \u201ctrain wreck\u201d by Sen. Max Baucus (D., Mont.). Sen. Jay Rockefeller (D., W.V.) said the law\u2019s sheer size and scope was \u201cbeyond comprehension,\u201d and not in a good way. Rep. Bruce Braley (D., Iowa), running for his state\u2019s open U.S. Senate seat, conceded it could have a negative effect on his campaign.\n\nAlso, Democrats like Kentucky Senate hopeful Alison Lundergan Grimes, Rep. Nick Rahall (D., W.V.) and embattled Sen. Mary Landrieu (D., La.) have attacked the president\u2019s new Environmental Protection Agency emission standards and their negative impact on coal.\n\nGrimes said she would fight Obama\u2019s \u201cattack on Kentucky\u2019s coal industry.\u201d Rahall said the Obama administration had displayed a \u201cdisregard for the livelihoods of our coal miners and thousands of families throughout West Virginia,\u201d and Landrieu ripped \u201cunelected bureaucrats\u201d in the EPA who didn\u2019t have the authority to set energy policy.\n\nAfter yet another White House delay on deciding whether to approve the Keystone Pipeline in April, Sen. Heidi Heitkamp (D., N.D.) issued a statement slamming Obama. \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely ridiculous,\u201d she wrote, \u201cthat this well over five-year-long process is continuing for an undetermined amount of time.\u201d\n\nAlso, the much-maligned secret trade the White House made of five Taliban commanders for Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl without consulting Congress infuriated usual liberal ally Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D., Calif.).\n\n\u201cI strongly believe that we should have been consulted, that the law should have been followed, and I very much regret that was not the case,\u201d she told reporters.\n\n[H/T Douglas Schoen]", "article_metadata": {"description": "Look no further than the Democratic Party for some of President Obama's vocal detractors these days.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Free Beacon", "description": "Look no further than the Democratic Party for some of President Obama's most vocal detractors these days.
