(AP) \u2014 Gary Gustafson leans on his ice ax to catch his breath. His legs and lungs, straining from nearly five hours of climbing and 4,000 feet of elevation gain, plead for rest before he spies the top of an antenna on the summit. Soon, the crampons of his mountaineering boots are once again digging into the icy terrain as he and a partner make the final push to the granite rooftop of New England.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of like Heartbreak Hill on the Boston Marathon,\u201d says Gustafson, 58, of Conway, New Hampshire. \u201c(Heartbreak\u2019s) really not much of a hill but it\u2019s where it hits you \u2026 that makes it such a tough obstacle. That\u2019s kind of what the summit cone is like. You can see the top and you want to just be there psychologically \u2014 but first you got to grind it out.\u201d\n\nThe payoff is being able to stand on the summit of 6,288-foot Mount Washington, the highest point in the Northeast. The peak is famous for some of the harshest weather on earth, where winds reach hurricane speeds on an average of once every three days during the winter.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re a winter hiker in the White Mountains, it\u2019s one of the ultimate hikes,\u201d said Gustafson.\n\nGustafson and his hiking partner, Linda Dewey, waited about four weeks for the right day. Their patience paid off last Tuesday with a 28-degree day and midday winds of only 30 mph.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Extreme weather makes Mount Washington a hiking challenge", "title": "Extreme weather makes Mount Washington a hiking challenge", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Extreme weather makes Mount Washington a hiking challenge", "title": "Extreme weather makes Mount Washington a hiking challenge", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/03/16/extreme_weather_makes_mount_washington_a_hiking_challenge/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/03/winter-on-mount-washington.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Extreme weather makes Mount Washington a hiking challenge", "title": "Extreme weather makes Mount Washington a hiking challenge", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/03/winter-on-mount-washington.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Robert F.
