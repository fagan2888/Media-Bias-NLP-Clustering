One of the teenagers was cited for possession of drug paraphernalia.\n\nIn another part of the park, an officer fired a Taser at someone who was fighting, Larson said. The Taser missed and the person escaped.\n\nLarson said that except for the disturbance, the three-day event ended without safety or security problems. The event typically draws 10,000 and 15,000 people.\n\nLast week, after gunfire was reported at an apartment complex about a quarter-mile from the park, the city tightened security at Christmas in the Park. No one was injured in the shooting.", "article_metadata": {"liveFyreID": "aHR0cDovL3RoZXNjb29wYmxvZy5kYWxsYXNuZXdzLmNvbS8yMDE1LzEyL21lc3F1aXRlLWNocmlzdG1hcy1pbi10aGUtcGFyay1ldmVudC1jbG9zZXMtZWFybHktYmVjYXVzZS1vZi1kaXN0dXJiYW5jZS5odG1sLw==", "generator": "WordPress 3.9.12", "author": "Claire Z.
