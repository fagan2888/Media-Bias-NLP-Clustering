So by virtue of him losing his license, there will not be any medical services allowed to be offered there at that clinic,\u201d Shepard said.\n\nPart of the board\u2019s concern involved Chalifoux\u2019s refusal to provide a list of his patients to the state Department of Health & Human Resources. The agency wants the information so it can notify current and former injection patients they may have been exposed to hepatitis B, hepatitis C and HIV.\n\nChalifoux was not notified of Friday\u2019s emergency meeting, and the board\u2019s legal counsel Jennifer Akers said notice was not required. All the board needed was information from an investigation by the state Bureau of Public Health, which began last year.\n\n\u201cThings their epidemiologists had actually observed, it involved non-sterile techniques. A number of things they observed that were very troubling,\u201d Akers said.\n\nDr. Chalifoux responded to the Bureau of Public Health\u2019s claims on Thursday in a written statement claiming:\n\n\u201cThe West Virginia Bureau for Public Health findings from the investigation of my practice did not include the re-use of needles or syringes for multiple patients by me or my staff for any reason. This is a false allegation that is only found in the state of Ohio release.\u201d\n\nThe Board of Osteopathic Medicine licensed Chalifoux to practice in West Virginia in 2004 after a year-long vetting process, one that typically takes only two to three weeks. Shepard recalled that board members were more cautious in their deliberations then because Chalifoux had faced allegations of malpractice in Texas.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Dr. Roland Chalifoux allegedly operating Marshall County clinic in unsanitary conditions.", "og": {"site_name": "WV MetroNews", "description": "Dr. Roland Chalifoux allegedly operating Marshall County clinic in unsanitary conditions.", "title": "Doctor\u2019s license suspended over dirty syringes", "url": "http://wvmetronews.com/2014/07/25/doctors-license-suspended-over-dirty-syringes/", "image": {"width": 2304, "identifier": "http://wvmetronews.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Roland_Chalifoux.jpg", "height": 1728}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://wvmetronews.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Roland_Chalifoux.jpg?w=640", "site": "@wvmetronews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 439959236158130, "pages": 327490709044}, "article": {"published_time": "2014-07-25T16:13:12+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-07-25T17:19:13+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "In the wake of Friday morning\u2019s vote, Chalifoux has the right to a hearing before the Board of Osteopathic Medicine within 15 days.\nAll the board needed was information from an investigation by the state Bureau of Public Health, which began last year.\nDiana Shepard, executive director of the Board of Osteopathic Medicine, said the suspension essentially puts Chalifoux\u2019s Valley Pain Management clinic in McMechen out of business.\nBy Jennifer Smith in News | July 25, 2014 at 12:13PMCHARLESTON, W.Va. \u2014 The state Board of Osteopathic Medicine unanimously approved a summary suspension of Roland Chalifoux\u2019s license after the Marshall County neurosurgeon was accused of reusing syringes on multiple patients.\nShepard recalled that board members were more cautious in their deliberations then because Chalifoux had faced allegations of malpractice in Texas."}
