Those forces include the Affordable Care Act provisions, Institute of Medicine reports and changing patient demographics.\n\n\"Nurses on the front lines are in the best position to determine the staffing needed for safe and equitable, quality care, but they consistently tell us they must fight for optimal nurse staffing. This whitepaper is our way of providing evidence to support the need for changes in nurse staffing across all healthcare settings,\" Pamela Cipriano, PhD, RN, president of the American Nurses Association, said in the release.\n\nHere are five findings from the whitepaper.\n\n1. Optimal staffing is crucial to providing professional nursing value. The whitepaper's authors found existing nurse staffing systems are often antiquated and inflexible. The authors said it is beneficial to have staffing models that consider the number of nurses and/or the nurse-to-patient ratios and can be adjusted to take into account unit and shift level factors.\n\n2. Factors that influence nurse staffing needs include: patient complexity, acuity, or stability; number of admissions, discharges, and transfers; professional nursing and other staff skill level and expertise; physical space and layout of the nursing unit; and availability of or proximity to technological support or other resources.\n\n3. Published studies show appropriate nurse staffing helps improve patient satisfaction and health-related quality of life. Appropriate nurse staffing also helps reduce the following:\n\nMedical and medication errors\n\nPatient mortality, hospital readmissions, and length of stay\n\nPreventable events such as patient falls, pressure ulcers,\n\nCentral line infections, healthcare-associated infections and other\n\nComplications related to hospitalizations\n\nCare costs through avoidance of unplanned readmissions\n\nNurse fatigue\n\n4. Organizations such as ANA support state and federal regulation and legislation that allows for flexible nurse staffing plans. In addition to promoting flexible staffing plans, ANA and like-minded constituents support public reporting of staffing data to promote transparency and penalizing institutions that don't comply with minimal safe staffing standards, the whitepaper authors said.\n\n5. ANA has introduced a legislative model in which nurses are empowered to create staffing plans. \"Optimal staffing is much more than just numbers, and direct care nurses are well equipped to contribute to the development of staffing plans,\" the whitepaper authors wrote.\n\nMore articles on workforce and labor management:\n\nNorwalk Hospital employees vote for unionization: 3 things to know\n\nWisconsin records show nurses stealing narcotics, threatening patient safety: 5 things to know\n\nRegulators oppose raising hospital prices for Baltimore job program: 5 things to know\n\n\u00a9 Copyright ASC COMMUNICATIONS 2016.
