National Family Mortgage states that it has surpassed over $200 million in total loans funded. Apparently loan velocity is increasing as well with June originations exceeding $15 million. The young peer to peer company reached their first $100 million in July 2013 and has now doubled that amount in about a year.

National Family Mortgage CEO Timothy Burke commented on the new milestone;

“It’s extremely rewarding to know how many families we have been able to help realize their dreams, from buying a home to refinancing a bank mortgage to financing a home improvement project. It’s equally rewarding to know how many families we have empowered to invest in loved ones while earning a solid financial return. We’ve helped keep over $90M in interest with U.S. families.”

National Family Mortgage is committed to offering consumers alternatives to traditional and costlier forms of home financing. National Family Mortgage states it has developed a safe and easy way for families to structure real estate loans with their relatives — thereby helping people arrange affordable loans, while reducing tax issues, protecting relationships, and keeping money in the family. National Family Mortgage has originated over $200M in loan volume since inception, while keeping over $90M in interest within families.
