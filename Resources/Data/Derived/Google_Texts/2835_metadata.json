Was I dreaming? Wasn\u2019t the United States deeply involved in Argentina\u2019s political upheavals? Ah yes, here\u2019s some $30 million in annual aid to the military dictators from the Ford and Reagan administrations. After the dictators fall, here\u2019s the United States obstructing efforts to bring them to justice. And the \u201cdisappeared\u201d of whom Mr. Cohen speaks with such reverence? The savagery they fell victim to was, according to documents released in 2002, backed by Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, and by many accounts actively supported by the C.I.A. To extend Mr. Cohen\u2019s metaphor of the child who won\u2019t grow up, it is oddly selective and misleading to omit the role of its abusive uncle, Uncle Sam.\n\nMaia Ettinger, Guilford, Conn.\n\nMr. Cohen manages, in slightly more than 800 words, to reduce an entire country, its people and history into a caricature designed for easy consumption. He indulges in descriptions of Peronism that would each require 800 words to be properly defined. He makes the \u201cDirty War\u201d into a quaint image of Argentine women sobbing uncontrollably. Even the headline turns Argentina into an antiquated symbol and an image of Madonna singing a pop song.\n\nMarianela D\u2019Aprile Knoxville, Tenn.\n\nI know that the Peronists\u2019 main goal, their perpetuation in power, comes at the expense of the Argentine economy, but they are very effective at pushing policies (some, like same-sex marriage, that are quite progressive) by building political alliances with both the right and the left. That pragmatism has become the signature of the party, a skill that no other political force has mastered, which is also why Argentina still suffers from the bad and enjoys the good that Peronism brings.\n\nI hope that other political forces will address Argentina\u2019s long postponed economic issues while maintaining a progressive social agenda, but if they want to compete with Peronism in future elections, they will have to learn a lot from them.\n\nVictoria Ballerini, Brooklyn, N.Y.\n\nMr. Cohen claims that we are a nation that never grew up, a child among the grown-up nations. I believe that this depends on your definition of progress. Progress means that nations have the ability to cooperate with others, to build bridges of solidarity with neighboring countries, and to develop laws that ensure full compliance with human rights. Today, Argentina is considered one of the main emerging economies. In 2013, G.D.P. per capita reached $18,600, the second highest in Latin America. My country has a strong tradition of defending education and public health: It spends 6 percent of its G.D.P. on education and culture, and 9.5 percent of its G.D.P. on health. Despite our history of dictatorships arising every time we began to make progress, Argentina has managed to grow in every way.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nValentina Risso Puerto Madryn, Argentina\n\nI was struck by Mr. Cohen\u2019s comparison of President Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner with Isabel Per\u00f3n. Isabel was never elected; Cristina has been elected twice, both times by wide margins. The article suggests both were widows who came to power over the dead bodies of their husbands; but Cristina was elected while her husband, N\u00e9stor Kirchner, was still alive. Any person covering Argentina during the last 11 years knows that the Kirchners were, if anything, a team running the country. Cristina was a successful lawyer, senator and legislator for decades before becoming president; Isabel Per\u00f3n was a cabaret singer and dancer. Under Isabel Per\u00f3n the policies that led to 30,000 disappearances were put into place; under the Kirchners hundreds of those guilty of \u201cDirty War\u201d crimes have been tried and sentenced.\n\nJoe Goldman, Buenos Aires\n\nPutin wants his Russian empire\n\nRegarding \u201cRussia has already lost the war\u201d (Review, March 8) by Chrystia Freeland: Yes, the Russians\u2019 attitudes toward Ukraine are rooted in the status quo reaching back a few hundred years. Yes, the Russians\u2019 sense of history makes them worry about their western buffer. But the most important reason President Vladimir V. Putin will never accept a truly independent Ukraine is not really as complex as has been suggested. The success of a democratic Ukrainian society in which corruption has been reined in and oligarchy eliminated would completely undermine the legitimacy of Mr. Putin\u2019s project to recreate an autocratic Russian empire. As such, it can never be permitted.\n\nDaniel Bronheim, Great Neck, N.Y.\n\nNatural gas and climate change\n\nRegarding \u201cTempering oil dependence\u201d (Opinion, Feb. 26): Dennis C. Blair and Michael W. Hagee\u2019s argument that we should reduce our dependence on oil \u201cthrough more deployment of fuels like electricity and natural gas\u201d is flawed. As they should know, electricity is not a fuel but an energy product that requires fuel to produce. Their advocacy of natural gas overlooks mounting evidence that methane emissions from natural gas threaten to seriously exacerbate global warming. It is no longer credible to argue for natural gas production while ignoring its environmental costs and dangers.\n\nAdrian Kuzminski, Fly Creek, N.Y.\n\nA partisan take on Israel and Iran\n\nRegarding \u201cDon\u2019t let up on Iran\u201d (Opinion, Feb. 25): An opinion article jointly signed by the president and the chairman of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee is about as useful as one written by the commander of Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guards about Israel. The authors ignore Israel\u2019s role in fanning the flames of radical Islam, encouraging America to embark on so-called wars of choice, and disingenuously exaggerating foreign threats in order to conceal its own illegal settlement expansion.\n\nHamid Varzi, Tehran", "article_metadata": {"tone": "opinion", "ptime": 20140314065058, "twitter": {"description": "Readers respond to Roger Cohen\u2019s op-ed on the self-destruction of Argentina.", "title": "Argentina\u2019s Long and Winding Road", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/15/opinion/argentinas-long-and-winding-road.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000002768091"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_150_black.png", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/15/opinion/argentinas-long-and-winding-road.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000002768091", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/15/opinion/argentinas-long-and-winding-road.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "opinion", "hdl_p": "Argentina's Long and Winding Road", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "March 14, 2014", "edt": "Global", "keywords": "Argentina,Buenos Aires (Argentina),Putin  Vladimir V,Natural Gas", "news_keywords": "Argentina", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "per": "Putin, Vladimir V", "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "Readers respond to Roger Cohen\u2019s op-ed on the self-destruction of Argentina.", "tom": "Letter", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "description": "Readers respond to Roger Cohen\u2019s op-ed on the self-destruction of Argentina.", "CG": "opinion", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "March 14, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "Letter", "article": {"section_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/pages/opinion/index.html", "section": "Opinion", "modified": "2014-03-15", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "tag": "Natural Gas", "published": "2014-03-14", "section-taxonomy-id": "AD8090D7-4137-4D71-84C8-70DA3BD89778"}, "geo": "Buenos Aires (Argentina)", "slug": "15iht-edlets15", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20140315021802, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/15/opinion/argentinas-long-and-winding-road.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_291_black.png", "type": "article", "description": "Readers respond to Roger Cohen\u2019s op-ed on the self-destruction of Argentina.", "title": "Argentina\u2019s Long and Winding Road"}, "pdate": 20140314, "des": "Natural Gas", "articleid": 100000002768091, "cre": "International New York Times", "hdl": "Argentina\u2019s Long and Winding Road", "col": "Letters", "PST": "Letter"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9683\"", "article_summary": "Their advocacy of natural gas overlooks mounting evidence that methane emissions from natural gas threaten to seriously exacerbate global warming.\nIt is no longer credible to argue for natural gas production while ignoring its environmental costs and dangers.\nCristina was a successful lawyer, senator and legislator for decades before becoming president; Isabel Per\u00f3n was a cabaret singer and dancer.\nRegarding \u201cCry for me, Argentina\u201d (Opinion, Feb. 28): After reading Roger Cohen\u2019s ode to the self-destruction of Argentina, I had to run to my computer and perform a quick search.\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main storyValentina Risso Puerto Madryn, ArgentinaI was struck by Mr. Cohen\u2019s comparison of President Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner with Isabel Per\u00f3n."}
