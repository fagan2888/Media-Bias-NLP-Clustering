WASHINGTON (AP) — Staring at the specter of a partial government shutdown, Sen. John McCain says he’s never seen anything like the harsh partisanship pervading much of Washington politics.

The Arizona Republican, serving his fifth term, says “we are dividing the Republican Party rather than attacking Democrats.”

Appearing Friday on “CBS This Morning,” McCain said he wouldn’t judge the motives of Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, who conducted a more than 21-hour speech marathon in the Senate this week against Obamacare. But he also said that “I have not seen” anything like the gridlock that now has left the country facing a federal shutdown by Tuesday.

McCain called the federal government “very dysfunctional.” He was asked about divisions within the GOP over what strategy should be used to kill Obama’s signature health care program.
