The Pirates designated infielder Brent Morel for assignment today to make room for Aramis Ramirez on the active roster.

Ramirez, whom the Pirates acquired Thursday from the Milwaukee Brewers, joined the Pirates today.

Morel, a 28-year-old corner infielder, played in three games for the Pirates. His pinch-hit double scored the go-ahead run in Friday nightâ€™s 7-5 victory against the Washington Nationals.

Morel was out of minor league options. The Pirates have 10 days to trade or release him. If he clears waivers they can assign him outright to Class AAA Indianapolis, but Morel, who has been designated for assignment before, can reject the assignment and become a free agent.
