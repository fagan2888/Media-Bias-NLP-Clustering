Hardy, Chairman of the Walker County Hospital District Board of Managers:\n\n\u201cThe Walker County Hospital District was established in 1975 to provide quality patient care to the community. For the past 40 years, the District has worked diligently to ensure that the community is offered a broad range of hospital services that meet the needs of County citizens, including Walker County\u2019s indigent population.\n\nRecent changes to the healthcare reimbursement system and the competitive healthcare market\u2014 some attributable to the Affordable Care Act\u2014have altered the traditional market for hospital services and forced medical facilities across the country, especially communities such as Huntsville, to assess their options for maximizing the viability of the hospital. As responsible stewards of our community\u2019s medical needs, the District is actively evaluating the best option for ensuring adequate funding to improve the hospital and provide additional services, with the underlying goal of providing quality patient care well into the future.\n\nThis evaluation includes assessing our arrangement with the Walker County Hospital Corporation, d/b/a Huntsville Memorial Hospital, including the ownership structure of the hospital itself. To assist us in effectively evaluating our options, the District has engaged financial consultants Hilltop Securities and legal advisors Bracewell, LLP and Beatty Bangle Strama P.C.\n\nOur priorities in undertaking this process are clear: maintaining a best-in-class facility here in Walker County that provides members of the public with the full range of medical services they require\u2014and deserve. The District is committed to transparency, and we will provide updated information to Walker County citizens throughout this process. To that end, we are creating a website where citizens can obtain information and provide their input. The website will go online soon.\n\nLike hospital systems across the country, the District is facing new challenges, but we are confident that we will find a resolution that achieves quality health care for the citizens of Walker County.\u201d\n\nThe Walker County Hospital District of Walker County, Texas is a political subdivision of the State of Texas. The District was authorized by an Enabling Act by the Texas Legislature under Senate Bill No. 1020 of the 62nd Legislature on June 9, 1971. A five member Board of Managers conducts the business of the District.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Walker County Hospital District is evaluating options for ensuring adequate funding to improve the hospital and provide additional services.
