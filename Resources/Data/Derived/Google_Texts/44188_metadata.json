(AP) - Peggy Cosgrove knows a thing or two about the general public\u2019s unwavering devotion to the Buffalo wing.\n\nSeveral years ago, she had an epiphany of sorts. She realized that, while the area bulged at the seams with wing joints, it lacked in terms of bottled finished wing sauces people could purchase at their neighborhood supermarkets.\n\nMarket potential realized, Cosgrove eventually took the plunge and embarked on a risky yet exciting new adventure.\n\nIn March 2012, with help from her sister Kathleen Fritch and a small business loan, she started selling her Peggy\u2019s Wing Sauce brand of bottled Buffalo wing sauces.\n\nThe business has grown substantially in the three years since its launch and can now be found at more than 60 stores, including Gerrity\u2019s, Price Chopper, Quinn\u2019s, Ray\u2019s and, just recently, Wegmans.\n\n\u201cGetting in Wegmans is huge,\u201d said Cosgrove on a recent afternoon at her Green Ridge home. \u201cIt took over a year to land that.\u201d\n\nWhile most of her business is confined to Northeast Pennsylvania, Cosgrove does have a few out-of-town stores on her list, including the Jubilee Market on Manhattan\u2019s Upper West Side. The sauce also can be purchased on Amazon.com.\n\n\u201cAt times, things have been overwhelming. But, at the same time, the return we have gotten back and continue to get back has been invaluable,\u201d Cosgrove said. \u201cTaste sells. \u2026 And we wanted to promote a local product and build a brand.\u201d\n\nOpportunity knocks\n\nOf course, Cosgrove\u2019s name should be well known to local wing fans.\n\nFor many years, she co-owned Kelly\u2019s Pub & Eatery in South Scranton with five of her sisters. The restaurant long has been known to serve some of the area\u2019s best wings.\n\nWhile helping to run the front of the house at Kelly\u2019s, in addition to her day job as a family and consumer science teacher at Scranton High School, Cosgrove had harbored dreams of putting out a bottled wing sauce - more precisely, a finished wing sauce, complete with hot sauce, margarine and spices.\n\n\u201cIt was something that my sister Kathleen and I always talked about doing,\u201d Cosgrove said. \u201cWe were convinced there was an opportunity.\u201d\n\nThey spent a significant amount of time researching bottlers and other facets of the retail business. After much thought, Cosgrove decided to go ahead and start the business in late 2011, using a $20,000 small business loan and her own money.\n\n\u201cAs my cousin said the other day, \u2018Most people talk about doing something, but they never do it. You did it,\u2019\u201d Cosgrove said. \u201cIt was a risk. The hardest part of this endeavor was saying yes.\u201d\n\nShe and her sister received some assistance from a program at St. Joseph\u2019s University, as well as the University of Scranton\u2019s Small Business Development Center. However, most of what they learned was on-the-job trial and error.\n\nCosgrove stressed that the sauces are her own concoctions, not Kelly\u2019s, which Cosgrove left shortly after starting the business.\n\nThe sauce started with three varieties - mild, medium and hot, which Cosgrove describes as hot yet not so hot that \u201cyou have to sign a waiver.\u201d Last year, Cosgrove launched a new flavor, Sweet Heat, which combines the hot sauce with Asian-inspired ginger-based flavors.\n\nMild is her No. 1 seller, yet Sweet Heat is quickly gaining ground, she said. Like all the other sauces, she developed it over an extended period of time, submitting it to a group of friends she refers to as her \u201ctest panel.\u201d\n\nEach sauce is kosher and, except for the Sweet Heat, gluten-free.\n\nOn the shelves\n\nOf course, to get her product off the ground, Cosgrove needed to find a good place to distribute it.\n\n\u201cI went up and down the valley with my bag and went to all the stores and talked to all the managers,\u201d she said.\n\nGerrity\u2019s was the first to take her on, giving her shelf space in all of its stores. In time, other stores followed, thanks to Cosgrove\u2019s persistence and dozens of in-store demonstrations.\n\n\u201cThe demos sell a bottle every time,\u201d she said. \u201cI just try and promote myself in any way I can.\u201d\n\nPart of Cosgrove\u2019s sales pitch is the sauce\u2019s versatility. In fact, the Peggy\u2019s Wing Sauce motto is: \u201cIt\u2019s not just for wings anymore!\u201d\n\nOver time, she\u2019s developed a diverse slate of recipes that make use of the sauces, from hot wing dip to mac and cheese to scallops to deviled eggs to even martinis.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s excellent on seafood, chicken, pork and steak. It\u2019s great for grilling, Croc k-Potting, marinating. People love it on their eggs,\u201d she said.\n\nIn the beginning, the sauce was sold in 16-ounce plastic bottles. Then, Cosgrove switched to a 12-ounce plastic. Now, it\u2019s a 12-ounce glass bottle. Meanwhile, she\u2019s made several changes to the bottle\u2019s decal design.\n\nFor her bottling, Cosgrove uses a company from Vermont that produces each flavor in 400-gallon batches.\n\n\u201cPeople think I\u2019m in the basement doing it,\u201d Cosgrove said with a laugh.\n\nFrom there, the bottles are trucked to a local warehouse, where Cosgrove takes them and distributes them with help from her sister and a couple of friends. In the spring, she\u2019ll begin using a small distributor.\n\nCosgrove spends many nights and weekends crisscrossing the valley checking on her product.\n\n\u201cThere is no greater joy than walking in a grocery store and seeing your product on a shelf wiped out because of Sunday sales or after a football game,\u201d said Cosgrove, who also uses the business to do community service work for organizations like the Ronald McDonald House and Jewish Discovery Center. (She\u2019s been named to the Northeast Pennsylvania Business Journal\u2019s \u201cTop 25 Women in Business,\u201d and received a SAGE Award from the Greater Scranton Chamber of Commerce.)\n\nIn the coming months, Cosgrove will release two more flavors. Sales have doubled over the last year -Ms. Cosgrove declined to offer specific figures - and people now often ask her when she\u2019s going to try out for the popular entrepreneurial reality show \u201cShark Tank.\u201d\n\nUltimately, Cosgrove would love to see Peggy\u2019s Wing Sauce sold in stores up and down the Northeast Corridor, from Boston to Washington, D.C.\n\n\u201cWe do want to be a regional brand, absolutely,\u201d Cosgrove said. \u201cIt\u2019s crazy. Sometimes I have to sit back and think about what we did.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an ongoing process of changing it and making it better, constantly,\u201d she added. \u201cThat\u2019s important.\u201d\n\n___\n\nOnline:\n\nhttp://bit.ly/1D227Y4\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Times-Tribune, http://thetimes-tribune.com/", "article_metadata": {"description": "Peggy Cosgrove knows a thing or two about the general public's unwavering devotion to the Buffalo wing.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/feb/7/womans-wing-sauce-becomes-regional-favorite/", "site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "type": "article", "description": "Peggy Cosgrove knows a thing or two about the general public\u2019s unwavering devotion to the Buffalo wing.", "title": "Woman\u2019s wing sauce becomes regional favorite"}, "twitter": {"description": "Peggy Cosgrove knows a thing or two about the general public's unwavering devotion to the Buffalo wing.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Woman\u2019s wing sauce becomes regional favorite"}, "Author": "JOSH MCAULIFFE", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb5c7\"", "article_summary": "In March 2012, with help from her sister Kathleen Fritch and a small business loan, she started selling her Peggy\u2019s Wing Sauce brand of bottled Buffalo wing sauces.\nShe realized that, while the area bulged at the seams with wing joints, it lacked in terms of bottled finished wing sauces people could purchase at their neighborhood supermarkets.\nWhile helping to run the front of the house at Kelly\u2019s, in addition to her day job as a family and consumer science teacher at Scranton High School, Cosgrove had harbored dreams of putting out a bottled wing sauce - more precisely, a finished wing sauce, complete with hot sauce, margarine and spices.\nSCRANTON, Pa.
