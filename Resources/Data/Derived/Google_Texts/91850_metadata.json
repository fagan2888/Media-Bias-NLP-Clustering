In the week leading up to the tour, which started in Boulder, RTR tour director Chandler Smith went so far as the call Day 1 \u201cone of the toughest days\u201d in tour history.\n\nAssuming fair weather, that is.\n\nBut on a Sunday that saw Mother Nature play all her cards, 2,000 cyclists dealt with morning sun at the 20th mile in Nederland; rain, hail and lightning in the late morning between Central City and Idaho Springs; freezing rain, headwinds and snow (snow!) midafternoon during the day\u2019s final climb of Berthoud Pass. And then the ace in the hole: fog. FOG at the Berthoud Pass summit that led tour officials to end the route there at the 75th mile.\n\nCyclists and their bicycles, it was determined, would be shuttled en masse over the final 14 miles of the original course down Berthoud Pass to Winter Park. The line for the passenger bus was hundreds deep, pulsating with shivering limbs and chattering teeth.\n\nAmong the hands on deck scrambling to provide cyclists relief from the snow and cold as well as transportation was Susie Masterson, a 25-year resident of Winter Park and publisher of \u201cGuestGuide,\u201d a guidebook to the area\u2019s attractions. All she did \u2014 on her own accord \u2014 was walk the line of cyclists, pluck five of the most desperate, load by herself on her own vehicle three bicycles, crank the heat to 85 degrees and drop them off where they were staying that night.\n\nElevation profile with distance and the full complement of Colorado weather transformed \u201cone of the toughest days\u201d in Ride The Rockies history into one of the most unforgettable.\n\nBryan Boyle: 303-954-1311, @boyle or bboyle@denverpost.com", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Berthoud Pass,bicycle,climbing,Colorado,Cycling,Day 1,Ride the Rockies,Winter Park", "language": "en, sv", "og": {"site_name": "Ride the Rockies", "description": "A snowstorm and fog hit Day 1 of an already grueling stage to the 2014 Ride the Rockies Tour through Colorado, one considered tough even before bad weather.", "title": "Day 1 of Ride The Rockies 2014: Snowstorm, fog strike at Berthoud Pass", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/ridetherockies/2014/06/08/day-1-ride-rockies-winter-storm-strikes-summer-tour/2533/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/ridetherockies/files/2014/06/berthoud-rtr-495x369.jpg", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "A snowstorm and fog hit Day 1 of an already grueling stage to the 2014 Ride the Rockies Tour through Colorado, one considered tough even before bad weather.", "creator": "@boyle", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/ridetherockies/2014/06/08/day-1-ride-rockies-winter-storm-strikes-summer-tour/2533/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/ridetherockies/files/2014/06/berthoud-rtr-495x369.jpg", "title": "Day 1 of Ride The Rockies 2014: Snowstorm, fog strike at Berthoud Pass", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "A snowstorm and fog hit Day 1 of an already grueling stage to the 2014 Ride the Rockies Tour through Colorado, one considered tough even before bad weather."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf4a4\"", "article_summary": "FOG at the Berthoud Pass summit that led tour officials to end the route there at the 75th mile.\nCyclists and their bicycles, it was determined, would be shuttled en masse over the final 14 miles of the original course down Berthoud Pass to Winter Park.\nmidafternoon during the day\u2019s final climb of Berthoud Pass.\nIn the week leading up to the tour, which started in Boulder, RTR tour director Chandler Smith went so far as the call Day 1 \u201cone of the toughest days\u201d in tour history.\nElevation profile with distance and the full complement of Colorado weather transformed \u201cone of the toughest days\u201d in Ride The Rockies history into one of the most unforgettable."}
