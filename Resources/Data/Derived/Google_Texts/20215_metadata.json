This began by accident. Grandmom was trying to simultaneously look after a toddler and make dessert. But his delight in souffl\u00e9-making was so palpable that it has become a regular event.\n\nENLARGE Nicholas Frith\n\nThe bar, and the souffl\u00e9, rise higher on each visit\u2014each time he does a bit more and I do a bit less. He graduated from pushing the Cuisinart button and weighing the chocolate, to actually cracking and separating the eggs. Last week, he gravely demonstrated how you fold in egg whites to his clueless grandfather. (There is some cultural inspiration from Augie's favorite Pixar hero, Remy the rodent chef in \"Ratatouille,\" though this leads to rather disturbing discussions about rats in the kitchen.)\n\nIt's startling to see just how enthusiastically and easily a 2-year-old can learn such a complex skill. And it's striking how different this kind of learning is from the kind children usually do in school.\n\nNew studies in the journal Human Development by Barbara Rogoff at the University of California, Santa Cruz and colleagues suggest that this kind of learning may actually be more fundamental than academic learning, and it may also influence how helpful children are later on.\n\nDr. Rogoff looked at children in indigenous Mayan communities in Latin America. She found that even toddlers do something she calls \"learning by observing and pitching in.\" Like Augie with the souffl\u00e9s, these children master useful, difficult skills, from making tortillas to using a machete, by watching the grown-ups around them intently and imitating the simpler parts of the process. Grown-ups gradually encourage them to do more\u2014the pitching-in part. The product of this collaborative learning is a genuine contribution to the family and community: a delicious meal instead of a standardized test score.\n\nThis kind of learning has some long-term consequences, Dr. Rogoff suggests. She and her colleagues also looked at children growing up in Mexico City who either came from an indigenous heritage, where this kind of observational learning is ubiquitous, or a more Europeanized tradition. When they were 8 the children from the indigenous traditions were much more helpful than the Europeanized children: They did more work around the house, more spontaneously, including caring for younger siblings. And children from an indigenous heritage had a fundamentally different attitude toward helping. They didn't need to be asked to help\u2014instead they were proud of their ability to contribute.\n\nThe Europeanized children and parents were more likely to negotiate over helping. Parents tried all kinds of different contracts and bargains, and different regimes of rewards and punishments. Mostly, as readers will recognize with a sigh, these had little effect. For these children, household chores were something that a grown-up made you do, not something you spontaneously contributed to the family.\n\nDr. Rogoff argues that there is a connection between such early learning by pitching in and the motivation and ability of school-age children to help. In the indigenous-tradition families, the toddler's enthusiastic imitation eventually morphed into real help. In the more Europeanized families, the toddler's abilities were discounted rather than encouraged.\n\nThe same kind of discounting happens in my middle-class American world. After all, when I make the souffl\u00e9 without Augie's help there's a much speedier result and a lot less chocolate fresco on the walls. And it's true enough that in our culture, in the long run, learning to make a good souffl\u00e9 or to help around the house, or to take care of a baby, may be less important to your success as an adult than more academic abilities.\n\nBut by observing and pitching in, Augie may be learning something even more fundamental than how to turn eggs and chocolate into souffl\u00e9. He may be learning how to turn into a responsible grown-up himself.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "article.created": "2014-07-03T21:37:00.000Z", "article.section": "Life and Style", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "Article", "twitter": {"domain": "wsj.com", "description": "Alison Gopnik's experiences with her 2-year-old grandson suggest that new theories about education, called Learning through Observation and Pitching In, have validity.", "title": "A Toddler's  Souffl\u00e9s Aren't Just Child's Play", "image": {"src": "https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-DN900_mindma_G_20140703173449.jpg", "alt": "Alison Gopnik's toddler grandson, a baker, spurs new ideas about education", "identifier": "https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-DN900_mindma_D_20140703173449.jpg"}, "site": "@WSJ", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "al": {"ios": {"url": "wsj://launch?articleid=SB10001424052702303390404580003092220850712&headline=Alison%20Gopnik%26apos%3Bs%20toddler%20grandson%2C%20a%20baker%2C%20spurs%20new%20ideas%20about%20education&weburl=http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303390404580003092220850712"}}, "page.site.product": "WSJ", "keywords": "alison gopnik,barbara rogoff,behavior,children,education,mind and matter,psychology,computers,electronics,household appliances,consumer goods,durable household products,consumer electronics,home electronics,appliances,technology", "news_keywords": "alison gopnik,barbara rogoff,behavior,children,education,mind and matter,psychology,computers,electronics,household appliances", "article.headline": "Alison Gopnik's toddler grandson, a baker, spurs new ideas about education", "cXenseParse": {"candybar": {"image": "https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-DN900_mindma_E_20140703173449.jpg"}, "poptart": {"image": "https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-DN900_mindma_D_20140703173449.jpg"}}, "description": "Alison Gopnik's experiences with her 2-year-old grandson suggest that new theories about education, called Learning through Observation and Pitching In, have validity.", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=364387007,app-argument=wsj://launch?articleid=SB10001424052702303390404580003092220850712&headline=Alison%20Gopnik%26apos%3Bs%20toddler%20grandson%2C%20a%20baker%2C%20spurs%20new%20ideas%20about%20education&weburl=http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303390404580003092220850712", "user.type": "nonsubscriber", "testkeys": "A", "article.page": "News", "article.summary": "Alison Gopnik's experiences with her 2-year-old grandson suggest that new theories about education, called Learning through Observation and Pitching In, have validity.", "page.site": "wsj", "page.content.format": "responsive", "article.published": "2014-07-03T21:37:00.000Z", "dj.asn": "i-73ef", "robots": "noarchive,noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj", "image_count": 1, "word_count": 627}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Article", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "Alison Gopnik's experiences with her 2-year-old grandson suggest that new theories about education, called Learning through Observation and Pitching In, have validity.", "title": "A Toddler's  Souffl\u00e9s Aren't Just Child's Play", "url": "http://www.wsj.com/articles/a-toddler-baker-spurs-new-ideas-about-education-1404423431", "image": {"width": 553, "identifier": "https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-DN900_mindma_G_20140703173449.jpg", "height": 369}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "author": "Alison Gopnik", "article.access": "free", "page.content.source": "WSJ Online Article", "article.origheadline": "A Toddler\u2019s  Souffl\u00e9s Aren\u2019t Just Child\u2019s Play", "article.type": "Mind and Matter: Alison Gopnik", "article.id": "SB10001424052702303390404580003092220850712", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2014-07-03T21:37:00.000Z"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9211\"", "article_summary": "And it's striking how different this kind of learning is from the kind children usually do in school.\nThe Europeanized children and parents were more likely to negotiate over helping.\nWhen they were 8 the children from the indigenous traditions were much more helpful than the Europeanized children: They did more work around the house, more spontaneously, including caring for younger siblings.\nHe graduated from pushing the Cuisinart button and weighing the chocolate, to actually cracking and separating the eggs.\nAfter all, when I make the souffl\u00e9 without Augie's help there's a much speedier result and a lot less chocolate fresco on the walls."}
