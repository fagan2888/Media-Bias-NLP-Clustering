Not just in his ability to bring about real \u201cchange\u201d in Washington, but for Congress to believe in its. Congress too can be the one we\u2019ve been waiting for. It can give us \u201cchange we can believe in\u201d and take us \u201cforward\u201d\u2013and it can show the folks in America that change doesn\u2019t happen here from the top down, but from the bottom up\u2013like all good things, except the ones that happen from the middle out.\n\nHouse Democrats also love their slogans and responded in lock step a day later, with an \u201caction plan\u201d meant to counter Republican inaction, gridlock, and petty constitutional lawsuits against the executive branch. The Democratic House leadership promised that if they become the majority party after the 2014 midterm elections, they would spend the first 100 days of the 114th Congress working to: (a) increase the minimum wage to $10.10 an hour; (b) \u201cjumpstart\u201d the middle class by passing the Student Emergency Loan Refinancing Act, the CEO-Employee Pay Fairness Act, and the Build American Bonds Act, and (c) help women (and presumably families) by strengthening the Violence Against Women Act, and passing the Paycheck Fairness Act, the Strong Start for America\u2019s Children Act, and the Healthy Families Act.\n\nTwo \u2018fairnesses,\u2019 a \u2018healthy,\u2019 and a \u2018strong start;\u2019 better \u2018bonds,\u2019 less \u2018violence,\u2019 lower payments, and more pay: it may not be another New Deal, but \u201cdo something\u201d is certainly a nice complement to FDR\u2019s \u201ctry something,\u201d which jumpstarted Progressive demagoguery in the 1930s.\n\nThe rub for the contemporary Republican party is that if it\u2019s not willing to act on its own set of euphonious proposals\u2013or, better yet, endorse all the Democrats\u2019 \u201ccommon sense\u201d ones\u2013it\u2019s charged with being the do-nothing party of no. This has led some Republicans angling for the White House (like Chris Christie) to suggest that Republicans ought to run as the more efficient do-somethings, while others applaud do-nothing as no failure at all, but rather the genuinely conservative alternative.\n\nNothing certainly beats something if something is just about anything on the Congressional Democrats\u2019 list. And, Republicans should remind voters this fall, nothing would also have beaten the signature laws of the last Democratic Congress, Obamacare (\u201cThe Affordable Care Act\u201d) and the stimulus boondoggle (\u201cThe American Recovery and Reinvestment Act\u201d). First, do no harm\u2013as good advice for legislators as doctors.\n\nLegislating is an intermittent, piecemeal, cautious work, however, for reasons deeper than information theory posits. Our understanding of both medical and social pathologies is limited\u2013and rather more so in the case of the latter than the former. Complex systems are prone to unintended consequences that often overwhelm the benefits of even treatments administered with the best of intentions\u2013and no system is more complex than civil life.\n\nLegislating is an intermittent, piecemeal, cautious work, however, for reasons deeper than information theory posits. Most fundamentally, as James Madison suggests in Federalist 53, it is because, since human nature is fixed, the general objects of legislation are fixed, and, therefore, the laws need only be occasionally accommodated to new circumstances\u2013and that by analogy from old ones.\n\nIn making the case for the usefulness of two-year terms for members of the House (in a context in which twelve of the thirteen states held elections for legislators at least annually), Madison argues that the \u201cknowledge\u201d necessary to legislate well (resulting from a combination of \u201cinformation\u201d and \u201cexperience\u201d) cannot be acquired so quickly as a one-year term would require.\n\nAll four of the \u201cprincipal objects of federal legislation\u201d\u2013foreign trade, interstate trade, taxation, and \u201cuniform regulations for the militia\u201d\u2013require at least some familiarity with the \u201caffairs, and even\u2026the laws of all the states.\u201d Note that Madison was concerned legislators wouldn\u2019t have enough knowledge to make wise laws even when the \u201cprincipal objects\u201d of legislation were well-defined and limited in number. How much more would his concern apply to the infinitely more ambitious Progressive legislative agenda today\u2013determined to rid the nation (and ultimately the world) of age-old pathologies like poverty, crime, and conflict?\n\nNevertheless, Madison acknowledged that, in absolute terms, the knowledge necessary to legislate well will diminish over time:\n\nThe most laborious task will be the proper inauguration of the government and the primeval formation of a federal code. Improvements on the first draughts will every year become both easier and fewer. Past transactions of the government will be a ready and accurate source of information to new members. The affairs of the Union will become more and more objects of curiosity and conversation among the citizens at large. And the increased intercourse among those of different States will contribute not a little to diffuse a mutual knowledge of their affairs, as this again will contribute to a general assimilation of their manners and laws.\n\nFor Madison, there is little new under the sun. The great work is that of founding\u2013establishing the right constitution and the initial federal code (a work that Madison devoted himself to for ten years, from the Constitutional Convention through the first four Congresses). After that, occasional improvements might be accomplished with relative ease, as the experience, familiarity, and homogenization of Americans across the Union grows\u2013and the fundamentals of political life remain the same.\n\nYet American politics took a very different turn in the 20th century, as progressives challenged Madison\u2019s understanding and the laws that resulted from it. Consider the jarring contrast between Madison\u2019s observations and the opening lines of Woodrow Wilson\u2019s The New Freedom (1913):\n\nThere is one great basic fact which underlies all the questions that are discussed on the political platform at the present moment. That singular fact is that nothing is done in this country as it was done twenty years ago.\n\n\n\nWe are in the presence of a new organization of society. Our life has broken away from the past. The life of America is not the life that it was twenty years ago; it is not the life that it was ten years ago. We have changed our economic conditions, absolutely, from top to bottom; and, with our economic society, the organization of our life. The old political formulas do not fit the present problems; they read now like documents taken out of a forgotten age.\n\nFor Wilson, it wasn\u2019t merely the work of the American founders that was hopelessly antiquated\u2013it was any political principle more than a decade old. Progressivism requires permanent revolution and perpetual refounding\u2013and, in the president-driven administrative state, it has established the means necessary to accomplish this. As a result, even when Congress does nothing, legislating by other (executive and regulatory) means continues. If there is nothing new to be done, there is always more to be undone.\n\nCongressional Republicans would do well to remind voters of the dangers of a Democratic Congressional majority and avoid all temptations to formulate a me-too Progressive-lite agenda for the fall campaign. But they\u2019ll need to do more in order to stop, much less reverse, the advance of the Progressive leviathan.\n\nA good example of what this type of action looks like is found in Utah Republican Senator Mike Lee\u2019s Conservative Reform Agenda, a set of action items that aim to tackle systemic societal problems by empowering individuals and families. Lee\u2019s policy formula (from employment to education to transportation matters) is simple: encourage individual and familial liberty by creating the greatest amount of flexibility in every important life decision Americans make.\n\nLee\u2019s approach embodies two simple precepts that Republican officeholders and candidates would do well to adopt in designing an action plan of their own.\n\nFirst: addition begins with subtraction. Renovating a structure that has been plagued by careless craftsmanship is not an easy task when people are living in the building\u2013as is always the case in politics. Wrecking balls, while rhetorically appealing, can\u2019t be the usual tool of choice. As Lee\u2019s agenda suggests, a limited-government majority should begin with multiple and targeted steps to remove the political debris that has made such a mess of American politics before moving on to more substantial renovations.\n\nSecond: follow the original blueprint (as closely as you can). The Constitution remains a reliable guide for American statesmen. It provides a \u2018do-something\u2019 Congress with all the tools that it needs to do its part\u2013and, in Madison\u2019s \u201cprincipal objects,\u201d a good place to start.\n\nIn sum, neither Rome nor America (nor any other great regime) was built or destroyed in a day. Renewing our liberty necessitates people employing their rational and moral faculties to a greater degree. The re-emergence of societal flourishing built upon political liberty will require both a regime that wants the people, more and more, to \u201cdo something\u201d\u2013and a people eager to act.", "article_metadata": {"item-publish-date": "Mon, 21 Jul 2014 06:33:44 EDT", "og": {"site_name": "The Federalist", "description": "Nothing certainly beats something if something is just about anything on the Congressional Democrats\u2019 list.", "title": "What Should a \u2018Do Something\u2019 Congress Do?", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://thefederalist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/capitol1.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-07-23T07:19:10+00:00", "url": "http://thefederalist.com/2014/07/21/what-should-a-do-something-congress-do/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Federalist", "description": "Nothing certainly beats something if something is just about anything on the Congressional Democrats\u2019 list.", "creator": "@FDRLST", "image": {"src": "http://thefederalist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/capitol1.jpg"}, "title": "What Should a \u2018Do Something\u2019 Congress Do?", "site": "@FDRLST", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article": {"section": "The Federalist Today", "tag": "Chris Christie,Mike Lee,Obamacare,President Barack Obama,Republicans,The Affordable Care Act,The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act,White House,Woodrow Wilson", "published_time": "2014-07-21T06:33:44+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-07-23T07:19:10+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Nothing certainly beats something if something is just about anything on the Congressional Democrats\u2019 list."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd5202\"", "article_summary": "President Barack Obama announced last week that his \u201cbig motto\u201d for the United States Congress is \u201cdo something.\u201d After winning the presidency with some other \u201cbig\u201d slogans, all the president is asking the Congress to do six years later is to \u201chope\u201d again.\nNot just in his ability to bring about real \u201cchange\u201d in Washington, but for Congress to believe in its.\nIt provides a \u2018do-something\u2019 Congress with all the tools that it needs to do its part\u2013and, in Madison\u2019s \u201cprincipal objects,\u201d a good place to start.\nAs a result, even when Congress does nothing, legislating by other (executive and regulatory) means continues.\nCongress too can be the one we\u2019ve been waiting for."}
