According to the height of the bars, the ratio was actually 3:8. Making it worse, there wasn't even a scale.\n\nWell, today, Fox has apologized and issued a correction, saying the chart should have looked like this:\n\n\n\nthe right thing\n\nIndeed, the chart is now properly scaled\u2014but before you go run off and congratulate Fox for doingtheir job, there's one little thing they didn't mention: The fact that Obamacare enrollments are now expected to hit that 7 million target (update @ 10:56 AM PT: WH spokesman Jay Carney just announced Obamacare enrollments have cleared the 7 million threshold), rendering the 6 million figure irrelevant\u2014unless you want to talk about the big last minute surge of enrollment.\n\nBottom-line: Fox would rather issue corrections that allow them re-report outdated information than talk about what's actually happening today with Obamacare. That's not a good sign for the anti-Obamacare crusaders.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Daily Kos", "description": "As you may have seen, yesterday Fox offered up this hilariously misleading chart of Obamacare's enrollment progress:", "title": "Fox issues backhanded apology for misleading chart", "url": "http://www.dailykos.com/story/2014/4/1/1288867/-Fox-issues-backhanded-apology-for-misleading-chart", "image": "http://s3.amazonaws.com/dk-production/images/75745/story_image/obamacareenrollment-fncchart.jpg?1396284158", "type": "article"}, "csrf-param": "authenticity_token", "fb": {"app_id": 170357783709}, "twitter": {"description": "As you may have seen, yesterday Fox offered up this hilariously misleading chart of Obamacare's enrollment progress:\n\nThe numbers on that chart said 6 million and 7 million, but visually, it was pu...", "title": "Fox issues backhanded apology for misleading chart", "image": {"src": "http://s3.amazonaws.com/dk-production/images/75745/story_image/obamacareenrollment-fncchart.jpg?1396284158"}, "creator": "@jedlewison", "site": "@dailykos", "card": "summary"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd14b0\"", "article_summary": "As you may have seen, yesterday Fox offered up this hilariously misleading chart of Obamacare's enrollment progress:The numbers on that chart said 6 million and 7 million, but visually, it was pure gibberish.\nBottom-line: Fox would rather issue corrections that allow them re-report outdated information than talk about what's actually happening today with Obamacare.\nAccording to the height of the bars, the ratio was actually 3:8.\nThat's not a good sign for the anti-Obamacare crusaders.\nMaking it worse, there wasn't even a scale."}
