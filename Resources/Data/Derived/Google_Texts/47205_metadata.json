The social networking site LinkedIn would likely be at the top of many of those rankings.\n\nLinkedIn was founded by a team headed by Reid Hoffman in 2002 and went public in 2011. While many of LinkedIn\u2019s peers ultimately disappointed their backers once they debuted on the open market, the site has been enthusiastically received by investors. It has also become a go-to spot for networking and job searching.\n\nRelated: LinkedIn's New Target Market: College-Bound Teens\n\nJeff Weiner joined LinkedIn as CEO in 2008 after a stint at Warner Brothers as head of its online divisions, developing the company\u2019s initial business plan in that space. Previously he spent more than seven years at Yahoo, including a position as executive vice president of its network division. At Yahoo, he was head of the team that directed the acquisition of Inktomi, AltaVista and FAST, in addition to helping to develop the company\u2019s search technology.\n\nDuring a fireside chat at Wharton\u2019s San Francisco campus held in conjunction with the Wharton Entrepreneurship Alumni Dinner, Weiner spoke with Andrew Trader, co-founder of the social games site Zynga, about LinkedIn\u2019s evolution, the importance of good execution and Weiner\u2019s approach to recruiting.\n\nA Rocket in Space\n\nAccording to Weiner, being part of a hyper-growth company is \u201clike being a rocket in space.\u201d Just a slight initial miscalculation in strategy can become a serious problem further down the road. \u201cHyper-growth companies often get so caught up with innovation and the adrenaline rush that they chase the next bright shiny thing at the expense of getting their launch trajectory right,\u201d he noted.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s invaluable to have someone on the team who understands technology and the way it\u2019s going to be changing society. Then the job is to get in front of those trends and unlock a tremendous amount of value.\u201d\n\nBeing able to execute well quarter after quarter involves putting the necessary processes in place early on, which is typically a lot less glamorous than pursuing the next technology breakthrough, Weiner said. \u201cIn addition, you need to be constantly revisiting this stuff, because the infrastructure you put into place five or 10 years ago, in a world dynamic such as ours, is something you\u2019re going to have to reinvest in.\u201d\n\nRelated: Why Facebook and LinkedIn Are Moving into Search\n\nWhen LinkedIn launched in 2003, the site received as few as 20 sign-ups on some days. Today, the site reports having more than 259 million users in 200 countries and more than two new sign-ups per second. In its most recent quarterly earnings report, LinkedIn reported revenue of $393 million \u2014 a 56% increase from the same period in 2012 \u2014 but the company\u2019s high valuation has led to questions over whether it can continue to grow at such a dramatic rate.\n\nAs the site begins its second decade, Weiner said that he is always looking for potential new hires with what he called \u201ctechnology vision.\u201d In a world increasingly driven by technology, \u201cit\u2019s invaluable to have someone on the team who understands technology and the way it\u2019s going to be changing society. Then the job is to get in front of those trends and unlock a tremendous amount of value.\u201d\n\nWeiner said his interviews with job candidates always begin with the same two initial questions: \u201cWhat is your dream job?\u201d and \u201cWhat is it that you want to accomplish?\u201d He noted that as the firm has grown, culture and values have become increasingly important. \u201cA few years ago, I might have rolled my eyes and thought of some Dilbert comic strip. I wasn\u2019t a big fan,\u201d he stated. \u201cThe companies I had been at had codified cultures and values, but people weren\u2019t walking the walk.\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until he got to LinkedIn, however, that Weiner realized that such things need to go beyond mere platitudes that show up in annual reports or on posters decorating employee break rooms. \u201cWe set about establishing very clearly what our values were,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd far more important than that, we live them. We live them every day in every way possible, and that starts with leadership.\u201d\n\nThe Next Play\n\nAs he contemplates LinkedIn\u2019s future, Weiner is reminded of the philosophy of Duke men\u2019s basketball coach Mike Krzyzewski. \u201cEvery time the Duke Blue Devils complete a sequence, on either the offense or defensive side of the court, no matter how well or poorly they performed, the coach yells out the same thing: \u2018Next Play,\u2019\u201d Weiner noted. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t want the team celebrating if they did something extraordinary, but he also doesn\u2019t want them lamenting a poorly executed play.\u201d\n\n\u201cAfter we filed, I walked around and thanked every employee that I could get to. What struck me was that everyone I went up to talked about our next play.\u201d\n\nWhen LinkedIn filed for its initial public offering in January 2011, Weiner said it was important that employees understood that going public was just one more stepping stone, as opposed to the company\u2019s end game. \u201cAfter we filed, I walked around and thanked every employee that I could get to. What struck me was that everyone I went up to talked about our next play. It was \u2018Next play this,\u2019 and \u2018Next play that.\u2019\u201d The phrase became LinkedIn\u2019s unofficial mantra; when employees rang the opening bell at the New York Stock Exchange on the company\u2019s first trading day, they had T-shirts printed with the \u201cLNKD\u201d ticker symbol on one side and \u201cNext Play\u201d on the other.\n\nRelated: The Facebook Effect: LinkedIn Clicks with Investors\n\n\u201cI draw a very clear distinction between leadership and management,\u201d Weiner noted. \u201cWhen I was younger, I didn\u2019t understand the difference. For me, leadership is the ability to inspire others to achieve shared objectives.\u201d The key term there is \u201cinspired,\u201d he added: \u201cFor me, that\u2019s the entire difference between leaders and managers. Managers tell people what to do. Leaders inspire them to do it.\u201d\n\nAccording to Weiner, when employees come to a manager with a serious issue, the manager must be able to understand where the employees are coming from, including their strengths and weaknesses, fears, what motivates them and what inspires them. \u201cThat takes an inordinate amount of time and energy,\u201d he noted. \u201cBut most managers want to get it over with as quickly as possible so they can move onto the next thing.\u201d\n\nInstead, Weiner said managers need to be able to put themselves in the shoes of the people they work with and understand things from others\u2019 perspectives. \u201cAs human beings, most of us tend to project our own worldview onto other people,\u201d he pointed out. \u201cThis is especially common in less experienced executives, and I was once one of them.\u201d\n\nRelated: 7 Ways to Fix Your Biggest Management Mistake\n\nNow that LinkedIn is a publicly traded company, Weiner also has to consider the expectations and motivations of the company\u2019s shareholders. \u201cYou want to find investors who will think not just about today, but next year; the next three years; the next five years,\u201d he noted. \u201cBecause if you\u2019re trying to build out a truly game-changing transformational platform, it costs. Those investors are out there, and if you can attract them, they will stick with you.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s up to company leadership to make sure the firm as a whole doesn\u2019t fall prey to the quarter to quarter expectations of analysts and Wall Street at large, Weiner added. When people ask him for advice about going public, Weiner noted that his first suggestion is, \u201cDon\u2019t go until you\u2019re ready.\u201d By readiness, he means \u201cknowing what it is you are trying to accomplish, having a sustainable competitive advantage, having the right team in place \u2014 and then not wavering from that.\u201d\n\n\u201cDuring the day, I carve out a couple of hours, without fail, when nothing is scheduled. It\u2019s buffer time; a time to think strategically and to just catch my breath.\u201d\n\n\u2018Happy Wife, Happy Life\u2019\n\nPrioritization is equally important when balancing a high-stress leadership position with personal and family life, Weiner said. \u201cIt took me four years to realize what made me happy: looking forward to going to work in the morning, and looking forward to coming home at night,\u201d he noted.\n\nWeiner credited his wife with being the foundation of their home. \u201cWhen I get asked about the most important piece of advice I was ever given, I repeat what an old friend told me years ago: \u2018Happy wife, happy life.\u2019 Because she is such an incredible wife and mother, it affords me the opportunity to do what I do.\u201d But Weiner added that he has had to prioritize in order to be home in time to tuck his daughters in at night, and to make sure business trips don\u2019t keep him away for too long.\n\nWhat has helped him do that, Weiner said, is adhering to a strict regimen for things like when he wakes up in the morning and when he exercises. \u201cAnd, during the day, I carve out a couple of hours, without fail, when nothing is scheduled,\u201d he noted. \u201cIt\u2019s buffer time \u2014 a time to think strategically and to just catch my breath.\u201d\n\nHe advised attendees that a similar tactic can be invaluable for accomplishing their career goals. \u201cThe single most important thing that people can do in terms of realizing their dreams professionally is to understand exactly what it is they want to accomplish,\u201d Weiner said. \u201cIt sounds simplistic, but it never ceases to amaze me how many people are well down the path of their career, but who never took the time to figure out what it is they actually want to do. And then they wonder why they\u2019re not happy, motivated or inspired by work.\u201d\n\nThis article originally appeared in Knowledge at Wharton.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The last few years have seen the emergence of a number of successful public technology", "title": "The Secret to LinkedIn\u2019s Long-Term Success", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2013/12/24/Secret-LinkedIn-s-Long-Term-Success", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/02142012_Linked_In_network_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2013/12/24/Secret-LinkedIn-s-Long-Term-Success", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/02142012_Linked_In_network_article.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "The last few years have seen the emergence of a number of successful public technology", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd184\"", "article_summary": "The social networking site LinkedIn would likely be at the top of many of those rankings.\nThe last few years have seen the emergence of a number of successful public technology companies.\nRelated: The Facebook Effect: LinkedIn Clicks with Investors\u201cI draw a very clear distinction between leadership and management,\u201d Weiner noted.\nWhile many of LinkedIn\u2019s peers ultimately disappointed their backers once they debuted on the open market, the site has been enthusiastically received by investors.\n\u201cIt\u2019s invaluable to have someone on the team who understands technology and the way it\u2019s going to be changing society."}
