And husband Bill Clinton will be campaigning Saturday in Chula Vista and Pomona on behalf of his wife, with a string of other stops planned by the former president through Monday.\n\n\u201cHe says a lot of things that are provocative, that actually make the important task of building this coalition, bringing everybody to the table and defeating terrorism more hard\u201d, she said.\n\nIf gun owners don\u2019t vote for Trump, and Democrats take control of the White House in November, \u201cWe will witness the end of individual freedom in this country\u201d, Cox said.\n\nIn all, Clinton has collected $213 million for the primary, more than any other candidate seeking the presidency, her campaign said Friday. \u201cIn my opinion, that\u2019s what she\u2019s going to go for\u201d. She also leads him among female voters by 15 points, while Mr Trump defeats her by 11 points among men.\n\nThe first four speeches at the NRA\u2019s annual meeting were full-throated attacks on Clinton, with speakers bringing up everything from her role in the aftermath of the terrorist attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, which left Ambassador Christopher Stevens dead, to the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe #BernieBros are a social media plague, preying on Hillary Clinton\u2019 s most earnest online fans.\n\n\u201cWe should do whatever we can to get him nominated\u201d, she said.\n\nBut if the facts wouldn\u2019t stop Cox, they sure weren\u2019t going to dissuade Lapierre, who once argued this: \u201cIf so-called gun-free zones supposedly save lives, why doesn\u2019t Obama simply declare Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan to be one big, happy, gun-free zone?\u201d\n\nThis was Donald Trump\u2019s second time addressing the NRA but some in this crowd will admit, last year, his winning the Republican nomination was far from a sure bet.\n\nFor instance, the NRA didn\u2019t endorse GOP nominee Mitt Romney until October, 2012.\n\nTrump, who days earlier released a list of his potential Supreme Court nominees, called on Clinton to do the same, saying the Democrat\u2019s list would be \u201cnight and day\u201d from his.\n\nHe told voters it\u2019s too late for establishment politics and that the US needs a government that represents more than just wealthy donors.\n\n\u201cThe Second Amendment is something that\u2019s in jeopardy in this election cycle\u201d, Perry said.\n\nTrump\u2019s remarks came at the National Rifle Association convention in Louisville, Ky.\n\n\u201cHillary said the Supreme Court is wrong on the Second Amendment\u201d.\n\n\u201cHillary Clinton, and I call her Crooked Hillary, she wants to abolish the Second Amendment\u201d.\n\nTrump also said that he would expand gun rights.\n\nClinton has made reducing gun violence a key plan of her campaign platform.\n\nIn a CNN interview, Clinton used the example of the apparent downing of an EgyptAir plane from Paris to Cairo to say that Trump would lack the skills to bring together US allies to respond to global threats. \u201cAnd that choice is Donald Trump\u201d.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Tribble Agency", "description": "\u201cAnd that\u2019s what we hope will happen again and we think it will\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019re going to stick to it\u201d.
