(REUTERS/Joe Skipper)\n\nThis week the Congressional Budget Office announced as part of its Budget and Economic Outlook (p. 69):\n\nOn the basis of information about 2015 enrollment and information available as of the end of December 2015 on 2016 enrollment, CBO and the staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) estimate that about 11 million people per month, on average, will receive such subsidies in calendar year 2016. Additionally, the agencies project that about 2 million people who are not eligible for subsidies will purchase coverage through an exchange, bringing the total number of people enrolled in coverage through exchanges in any given month to 13 million, on average.\n\nThat essentially means that the exchanges by year\u2019s end will be down 40 percent from the 20 million predicted last year. The Hill explains:\n\nThough it predicts fewer customers, the budget office says the number of people receiving subsidies will be higher than expected. About 11 million people are expected to receive subsidies this year, compared to 8 million people in 2015. And while healthcare spending has grown more slowly in the last several years, the CBO is projecting that per-person spending on healthcare programs \u201cwill grow more rapidly than it has in recent years.\u201d The cost of subsidies alone is expected to increase by $18 billion in 2016, reaching a total of $56 billion, and doubling that within a decade.\n\nThis is exactly the pattern Obamacare critics predicted: Fewer healthy people enrolling, resulting in smaller enrollments of sicker people with rising costs. The two fundamental objectives behind Obamacare \u2014 universal coverage and cost containment \u2014 have not been reached. We have, however, spent a boatload of money and raised taxes for many. Around 5 million people got booted off of their insurance plan, many of whom therefore could not keep their doctors.\n\nLike so much else of the social welfare state, the problem is not that Obamacare accomplished nothing. It is that it accomplished far less, at far higher cost, and with far less personal choice than might otherwise have been available. A balanced assessment from a University of Iowa professor puts it like this:\n\nThe truth is that, to the extent that Obamacare\u2019s major goal was to reduce the number of uninsured Americans, it has been a success. The rate of uninsured Americans is the lowest it has ever been since we started tracking that data more than 50 years ago. At the same time, the country still has a long way to go if the goal is to ensure that every American has some form of health insurance coverage. In that respect, Obamacare has underperformed. The CBO projections have proven to be overly-optimistic. The reduction in the number of uninsured seems to be leveling off. In short, we\u2019re approaching a floor. Now, on the other side of that floor, there are people who qualify for benefits under the ACA as originally enacted.\n\nTreating Obamacare as so valuable we dare not upset the apple cart does not sit well with many on the left. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) has tapped into that understanding, producing a break-the-bank single-payer health-care system. This is the opportunity conservatives have been anticipating. Health-care reformers on the right argue we can cover more people, at far less cost, with fewer taxes and with far more personal choice and control. Voters have every right to ask: So where is it?\n\nLanhee Chen and James Capretta have their own plan:\n\nAbout 155 million Americans get health insurance through their place of work. They should be left alone. The only change would be a new upper limit on the tax preference for employer-paid premiums, set so that only the most expensive 25% of plans would exceed it. . . . Individuals without employer coverage would get an age-adjusted tax credit to help purchase health insurance. These credits would be more flexible than ObamaCare\u2019s premium subsides, because there would be no strings attached, i.e., none of the current federal law\u2019s mandated benefits. Consumers could pick any state-approved plan that meets their needs and those of their family. Together with employer coverage, these tax credits would ensure that all have access to secure insurance. . . . Instead of forcing people to buy government-approved insurance, we propose to give people a strong incentive to stay insured: As long as they remain continuously insured, they cannot be charged higher premiums, have their benefits restricted, or be denied enrollment in a plan based on their health status.\n\nThey would add in a Medicaid reform (which would allow able-bodied adults and their children to combine Medicaid with a federal tax credit, thereby letting them enroll in a private insurance option) and Medicare reform. (\u201cFor new retirees, Medicare would provide a fixed level of assistance\u2014derived from bids submitted by competing insurance carriers and the calculated cost of staying in traditional Medicare\u2014which seniors would use to purchase a health plan of their choosing. Seniors could enroll in the traditional program, which would be modernized with a uniform deductible for hospital and physician services and more discretion for administrators to make distinctions among providers based on quality. Current retirees may choose the reformed program, or to remain in traditional Medicare with no substantial changes in their costs.\u201d) And, finally, health-care savings accounts could be expanded so Americans could use pre-tax dollars to pay for expenses in high-deductible plans.\n\nUnless the GOP wants to be stuck with Obamacare forever, and get beaten on the issues in the presidential race this year, they\u2019d do well to introduce and pass such a plan in the House, send to it to the Senate and let Democrats filibuster. The GOP presidential nominee should then run on it. There will be the choice: Obamacare in all its mediocrity (or a pie-in-the-sky single-payer plan) or the GOP plan. That\u2019s what elections are for and how mandates are obtained \u2014 not by rhetoric and running against the status quo but by presenting a better alternative to it. We will see if the GOP is capable of such a thing.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Obamacare delivers too little.", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Obamacare delivers too little.", "title": "Republicans should use the ACA enrollment bust to offer a better health plan", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2016/01/28/republicans-should-take-the-aca-enrollment-bust-and-offer-a-better-health-plan/", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2015/10/15/Health-Environment-Science/Images/Health_Overhaul_Signups-0ecdf.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@JRubinBlogger"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2016/01/28/republicans-should-take-the-aca-enrollment-bust-and-offer-a-better-health-plan/", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "healthcare referendum, obamacare enrollmetn, obamacare alternative", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "healthcare referendum, obamacare enrollmetn, obamacare alternative"}, "article_summary": "Around 5 million people got booted off of their insurance plan, many of whom therefore could not keep their doctors.\nLanhee Chen and James Capretta have their own plan:About 155 million Americans get health insurance through their place of work.\nAt the same time, the country still has a long way to go if the goal is to ensure that every American has some form of health insurance coverage.\nIndividuals without employer coverage would get an age-adjusted tax credit to help purchase health insurance.\nThere will be the choice: Obamacare in all its mediocrity (or a pie-in-the-sky single-payer plan) or the GOP plan."}
