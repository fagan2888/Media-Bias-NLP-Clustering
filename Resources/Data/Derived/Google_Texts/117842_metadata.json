The document states in part:\n\nThe Catholic community and Catholic institutions should not honor those who act in defiance of our fundamental moral principles. They should not be given awards, honors or platforms which would suggest support for their actions.\n\nThe faithful Catholic colleges recognized in The Newman Guide to Choosing a Catholic College are committed to this policy and more \u2014 they strive to honor excellent speakers and honorees who highlight their Catholic identity. (See our separate roundup here.)\n\nThese include: Cardinal Timothy Dolan of New York at Benedictine College; Cardinal Edwin O\u2019Brien, Grand Master of the Equestrian Order of the Holy Sepulchre of Jerusalem, and philosopher Dr. Alice Von Hildebrand at Christendom College; Cardinal Se\u00e1n O\u2019Malley, O.F.M., Cap., of Boston at Ave Maria University and Franciscan University of Steubenville; Archbishop Salvatore Cordileone of San Francisco at Thomas Aquinas College; Archbishop Joseph Kurtz, D.D., of Louisville at DeSales University; Bishop Emeritus Victor Galeone of Saint Augustine, Fla., at Belmont Abbey College; author and pastor Father George Rutler at Thomas More College of Liberal Arts; and Sister Regina Marie Gorman, OCD, Vicar General of the Carmelite Sisters of the Sacred Heart of Los Angeles, at Wyoming Catholic College.\n\nIn contrast to these choices, the Newman Society has identified the following scandalous commencement speakers and honorees at Catholic colleges in 2016:\n\nDePaul University, Chicago, Ill. (May 15) plans to honor Marty Castro, who was appointed to the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights (USCCR) by President Barack Obama in January 2011. Castro and the USCCR, under his leadership, have been major proponents of same-sex marriage. Following the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling on same-sex marriage last summer, Castro stated: \u201cWith this ruling, we celebrate the equality of all Americans before our Constitution. While this ruling is historic and sweeping for our nation, its most profound impact will be on those individual acts of union of two people whose love will now, finally, be treated equally before the law.\u201d Castro and the USCCR also opposed recent religious freedom legislation in Mississippi and North Carolina that is necessary to protect the rights of Catholic institutions to uphold Catholic teaching on sexuality. In attacking the bills, Castro embraced the \u201cgender ideology\u201d condemned by Pope Francis by claiming the legislation \u201cperpetuates homophobia, transphobia, [and] marginalizes the transgender and gay community.\u201d\n\nGeorgetown University, Washington, D.C. (May 19-22) plans to honor Gayle Smith, administrator for the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), and National League for Nursing CEO Beverly Malone. Both have actively pushed for greater access to so-called family planning services, including abortion and contraception. \u201cTo the detriment of all, and particularly poor women, hard-line abortion opponents in the White House, Congress, and state legislatures view not only abortion but even contraception as an evil,\u201d Smith stated in a co-authored article for the Center for American Progress. She promoted contraception in the piece as a means to \u201c[empower] women, and men, to make decisions about their lives and their families.\u201d Smith has further advocated USAID\u2019s \u201cfamily planning services\u201d on numerous occasions. \u201c[U]sing a modern method of contraception\u201d is emphasized in the family planning program. In December 2007, Smith touted the HELP Commission report and its advocacy for sexual and reproductive health services promoting contraception.\n\nLast summer, her approval as USAID director was reportedly delayed when questions surfaced regarding her views on prohibiting foreign aid money for abortion-related services (the Helms amendment). Planned Parenthood later applauded Smith\u2019s nomination, noting its confidence in Smith to \u201ccontinue the unprecedented momentum\u201d in providing \u201cmodern contraceptives.\u201d Under Smith\u2019s leadership, USAID continues to push use of contraception and encourage \u201cfamily planning methods\u201d through initiatives such as its Maternal and Child Survival Program.\n\nWhile with the Royal College of Nursing, the U.K.\u2019s largest professional union of nurses, Malone advocated for greater access to the \u201cmorning after pill\u201d and over-the-counter emergency contraception. \u201cWe need, as a society, to say goodbye to narrow outdated stereotypes of sexual health services as something furtive and shameful or as a kind of emergency service for the sexually reckless,\u201d Malone was later quoted saying. \u201cSexual health services should be about providing care wherever it\u2019s needed. That\u2019s why nurses are well placed to make a positive impact in modernising (sic) sexual health services. They can help provide safe and effective emergency contraception and also give young people the skills to access reliable contraception for the future.\u201d In July 2005, the Society for the Protection of Unborn Children decried Malone\u2019s support for abortion and push to have nurses more involved in committing abortions. In January 2006, Malone heralded a court decision that allowed nurses to continue giving young girls abortion advice without their parents\u2019 knowledge. Malone has overseen operations as CEO of the National League for Nursing since 2007.\n\nGonzaga University Law School (May 7) will honor Washington state attorney general Bob Ferguson, a strong supporter of same-sex marriage, who joined fellow attorneys general in 2014 to push for the Supreme Court to recognize same-sex marriages. \u201cWe\u2019ve been fighting every step of the way for marriage equality here in Washington and across the country,\u201d Ferguson reportedly said in his request to the Court. \u201cUntil same-sex marriages are recognized nationwide, we\u2019ll continue to stand up for the rights of those who cannot marry the person they love.\u201d Additionally, his views may have influenced religious freedom cases, as he filed a consumer protection lawsuit against a floral shop for declining to provide flowers for a same-sex wedding. The case resulted in a protracted religious freedom battle and will be heard before the Washington Supreme Court.\n\nLast July when a court of appeals upheld a Washington state law requiring pharmacies to provide emergency contraception regardless of religious objection, Ferguson applauded the decision. \u201cThis unanimous decision is a major victory for the people of Washington. Decisions regarding medical care \u2014 including reproductive rights \u2014are appropriately between a patient and his or her medical professionals,\u201d he said. In October, he filed an amicus brief in an effort to strike down a Texas state law that limited access to abortions. Ferguson was also endorsed by NARAL Pro-Choice Washington and Planned Parenthood Votes Northwest during his 2012 election campaign.\n\nLa Roche College, Pittsburgh, Penn. (May 7) will host Mark Shriver, president of Save the Children Action Network, as commencement speaker. His organization promotes contraception and is reportedly linked with Planned Parenthood. As the Newman Society reported previously, Shriver was regarded as a pro-abortion rights politician when he was a candidate for the U.S. House of Representatives from Maryland. During his brief stint in politics, Shriver garnered a 100 percent rating by NARAL Pro-Choice Maryland. In a 2002 Washington Post interview, Shriver stated, \u201cWomen\u2019s issues are critically important and I will continue to fight for a women\u2019s right to choose; family planning funds; maternal and child health funding and education for girls both here and abroad.\u201d Shriver will also receive an honorary doctorate of humane letters from La Roche College.\n\nLoyola Marymount University, Los Angeles, Calif. (May 7), plans to host former President Bill Clinton as the 2016 commencement speaker, a decision which has been criticized by The Cardinal Newman Society due to Clinton\u2019s pro-abortion history, advocacy for same-sex marriage and poor moral example to the University\u2019s students. Clinton has publicly defended Roe v. Wade, stating: \u201cEveryone knows life begins biologically at conception. No one knows when biology turns into humanity [\u2026] I thought then [in the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision] and still believe that the Court reached the right conclusion.\u201d Clinton also pushed the contraceptive drug RU-486, vetoed a ban on partial-birth abortions, signed legislation allowing fetal tissue research on aborted babies and rescinded the \u201cMexico City Policy,\u201d which prevented overseas organizations from using U.S. funds to provide abortions or information about abortions.\n\nClinton has also retracted his belief that marriage is between one man and one woman, and he now fully supports same-sex marriage. He called on the Supreme Court to strike down the Defense of Marriage Act which he signed into law in 1996. \u201cI changed my position,\u201d he said, according to Politico. \u201cI am no longer opposed to [same-sex marriage]. I think if people want to make commitments that last a lifetime, they ought to be able to do it.\u201d\n\nMerrimack College, Andover, Mass. (May 20, 22), will present pro-abortion and same-sex marriage supporter Charlie Baker, Governor of Massachusetts, as its commencement speaker. \u201cI will work to ensure that Massachusetts employers continue to offer comprehensive health insurance coverage, including contraception, to their employees,\u201d he reportedly stated after the Hobby Lobby decision in 2014. \u201cI'm Pro-Choice. I support a woman's right to choose,\u201d he also reportedly said. He also marched in the 2010 Boston Gay Pride Parade and publicly praised the Supreme Court\u2019s same-sex marriage decision last summer.\n\nRegis College, Weston, Mass. (May 7), will honor Sister Simone Campbell, S.S.S., as its commencement speaker and present her with an honorary doctorate of law. Sr. Campbell publicly dissents from Catholic teaching with her advocacy for \u201cwomen-priests\u201d and has claimed that the Vatican \u201cdoesn\u2019t know how to deal with strong women.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m optimistic that women will be able to serve as priests one day. But it will happen through practice. First we need to change the system,\u201d she wrote for Time last September. Even though female ordination is not a changeable teaching in the Church, Sr. Campbell encouraged women to dissent and continue to challenge Church teaching. \u201cPope Francis said that the \u2018door is closed\u2019 on the issue of women\u2019s ordination to the priesthood [\u2026] Women need to keep knocking on this closed door and eventually the change will come,\u201d she wrote in another Time article. Sr. Campbell is the executive director of NETWORK, a national Catholic social justice lobby organization that was part of a Vatican review in 2010 and lobbied to undermine the U.S. bishops\u2019 opposition to the Affordable Care Act because of abortion funding.\n\nThe College will also award an honorary doctorate of science to Dr. Paul Farmer, chief strategist and founding director of Partners in Health, a poverty health care group that endorses and promotes contraception as a substantial part of its operations. \u201cIn Haiti, all our clinics have a nurse trained in sex education and reproductive health counseling. Staff members have offered free condoms and contraception for more than 15 years,\u201d the PIH website touts. In Rwanda, the organization also encouraged \u201call women of childbearing age to consider contraceptive methods.\u201d The website describes a condom-education program in which \u201c[m]others and their infant babies, well-dressed older men, and young women in veils stared at the plastic models of penises in front of them.\u201d Under \u201cpriority programs,\u201d PIH\u2019s website declares that \u201cfamily planning is one proven method for safeguarding women\u2019s health\u201d and declares, \u201cStaff members have offered free condoms and contraception for more than 15 years.\u201d\n\nSaint Mary\u2019s College of California, Moraga, Calif. (May 21), will host superintendent of California\u2019s public school system Tom Torlakson as a commencement speaker. In his role as superintendent, Torlakson has been a public proponent of same-sex marriage, opposing the Proposition 8 effort to protect marriage between one man and one woman in California and applauding the Supreme Court\u2019s marriage ruling over social media. \u201cSame sex marriage is now a universal right, rules #SCOTUS. Congratulations to all on this historic victory! #LoveWins,\u201d he stated on Twitter. He has received 100 percent ratings from NARAL Pro-Choice California, Planned Parenthood Affiliates of California and the California Abortion and Reproductive Rights League, as well as public endorsements from Equality California and Planned Parenthood. Torlakson also supported legislation in California which required students to study the contributions of LGBT Americans as \u201crole models\u201d and mandated that \u201cchildren as young as kindergarten must be taught to admire persons who engage in homosexuality.\u201d\n\nSeattle University, Seattle, Wash. (June 12), will present Mark Shriver, president of Save the Children Action Network, as commencement speaker. His organization promotes contraception and is reportedly linked with Planned Parenthood. As the Newman Society reported previously, Shriver was regarded as a pro-abortion rights politician when he was a candidate for the U.S. House of Representatives from Maryland. During his brief stint in politics, Shriver garnered a 100 percent rating by NARAL Pro-Choice Maryland. In a 2002 Washington Post interview, Shriver stated, \u201cWomen\u2019s issues are critically important and I will continue to fight for a women\u2019s right to choose; family planning funds; maternal and child health funding and education for girls both here and abroad.\u201d\n\nUniversity of Notre Dame in Indiana (May 15), will honor pro-abortion and same-sex marriage advocate Vice President Joe Biden during its commencement ceremony with the Laetare Medal, the \u201coldest and most prestigious honor accorded to American Catholics.\u201d Biden has applauded the Supreme Court\u2019s pro-abortion ruling in Roe v. Wade, received a zero rating from the National Right to Life Committee during his time as a U.S. Senator, supported federal funding for embryonic stem cell research, voted against a ban on human cloning and supports the HHS mandate, which requires Catholic colleges and organizations to violate their moral beliefs. Biden has also publicly supported same-sex marriage. \u201cI am absolutely comfortable with the fact that men marrying men, women marrying women and heterosexual men marrying women are entitled to the same exact rights. All the civil rights, all the civil liberties,\u201d he said in a May 2012 interview on \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d \u201cAnd quite frankly I don\u2019t see much of a distinction beyond that.\u201d\n\nThe Cardinal Newman Society called on the University to rescind the honor, noting the scandal caused by publicly honoring someone who willingly violates Catholic moral teaching as an exemplary Catholic. The honor has also been condemned by Notre Dame students, faculty, Cardinal Raymond Burke and Ft. Wayne-South Bend\u2019s Bishop Kevin Rhoades, who said that the award could give scandal by suggesting \u201cthat one can be \u2018a good Catholic\u2019 while also supporting or advocating for positions that contradict our fundamental moral and social principles and teachings.\u201d\n\nXavier University of Louisiana in New Orleans (May 7), will host Dr. Helene Gayle, CEO of McKinsey Social Initiative, as commencement speaker. Gayle served as the president and CEO of CARE (Cooperative for Assistance and Relief Everywhere) from April 2006 to July 2015 and \u201cappeared before a Senate committee to urge the funding of abortions abroad by overturning the Mexico City Policy\u201d in 2009, according to LifeSiteNews. The article also reports, \u201cCARE also heavily distributes contraceptives, including the abortifacient \u2018emergency contraception,\u2019 as part of its development efforts. Moreover, it partners with the illegal-abortion practitioner Marie Stopes International.\u201d Gayle will also receive an honorary degree.\n\nCatholic Education Daily is an online publication of The Cardinal Newman Society.
