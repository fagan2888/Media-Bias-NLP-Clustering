Prof. Tamara Beauboeuf-LaFontant Cited in The Nation

May 6, 2016

Writing in The Nation about untreated depression, Debbie Nathan observes, "One reason for the lack of treatment is that, even with Obamacare, many poor people still don’t have health insurance. And even when they do have plans, many psychotherapists don’t accept them. Another is what several feminist researchers call 'the myth of the Strong Black Woman.' Sociologist Tamara Beauboeuf-LaFontant notes that white culture has never viewed black women as normatively feminine. Instead, slavery and Jim Crow assigned stereotypes: sharp-tongued Sapphires; big, asexual, all-giving Mammies; and fertile, Jezebel-like welfare queens. Today, another stereotype has arisen: the notion that extraordinary strength is a natural quality of black women."

Dr. Beauboeuf-LaFontant is professor and director of women's, gender and sexuality studies at DePauw University. She is cited in an article headlined, "What Happened to Sandra Bland?". Access it at the publication's website.

The professor is the author of Behind the Mask of the Strong Black Woman: Voice and the Embodiment of a Costly Performance. Learn more in this previous summary.
