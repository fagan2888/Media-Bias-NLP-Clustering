For 2015, it said it is pricing premiums based on an expectation that spending will accelerate by another 50 to 100 basis points.\n\nInvestors have been watching medical cost trends closely for any reversal of the low use of medical services in recent years.\n\nSome hospitals have reported an uptick in use driven by a rebound in the economy. Others have said medical services use is up because of implementation of the national healthcare reform law.\n\nSo far, Aetna said unexpected increases have been largely in areas like pharmaceutical cost and hospital outpatient use.\n\n\"I wouldn't say we have gotten to the point where we are drawing a conclusion that there is a widespread move upwards in medical cost trends,\" Aetna Chief Financial Officer Shawn Guertin said.\n\nAetna said third-quarter profit rose as the benefits of its Coventry government healthcare acquisition offset these higher medical costs.\n\nAetna said the percentage of premiums collected that it spent on covering medical services increased 0.5 percentage points to 81 percent in its commercial business, which includes new individual health plans. For commercial and government businesses combined, the ratio fell to 82.3 percent from 83.1 percent.\n\nIn 2014, Aetna began selling health insurance to individuals on the new healthcare exchanges created under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nAetna said it has almost 600,000 new insurance exchange customers and that they have higher costs per patient than expected. But it said it began making a slight profit on the business during the third quarter as high volume helped defray fixed costs.\n\nAetna reported net income of $594.5 million, or $1.67 per share, up from $518.6 million, or $1.38 per share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 13 percent to $14.7 billion, slightly above analysts' expectations.\n\nAetna said operating earnings were $1.79 per share excluding transaction costs, beating analysts' expectations of $1.58.\n\nAetna raised its 2014 earnings forecast to $6.60 to $6.70 per share from $6.45 to $6.60.
