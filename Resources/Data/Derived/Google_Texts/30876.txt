A play tower designed by acclaimed Oklahoma architect Bruce Goff was re-installed Tuesday at Bartlesville's Sooner Park.

The tower, which is reminiscent of the space-age era in which it was designed, is constructed of steel mesh with a spiraling staircase and a mesh sphere that reaches 50 feet above the ground

Last year was the 50th anniversary of the tower. In 1963, Goff was commissioned to design the tower to be the centerpiece of Bartlesville's Sooner Park. The tower was in the center of a circular concrete barrier 50 feet in diameter that was used as a sand play pit area.

The tower was closed in the early 1990s due to deterioration. Last year, city officials and ConocoPhillips began a fund raising campaign to restore the tower to all its glory. It was taken down and the process to restore it began.

Tuesday, workers re-installed the restored tower which is one of Bruce Goff's few public works of sculpture.

The city of Bartlesville has not said when the tower will be reopened to the public.

Bruce Goff also designed the Boston Avenue United Methodist Church in downtown Tulsa.
