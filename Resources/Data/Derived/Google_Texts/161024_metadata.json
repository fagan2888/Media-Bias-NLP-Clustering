The GOP front-runner roughly doubles his closest rivals Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio 35 percent to 18 each according to Public Policy Polling.\n\nIn particular, Trump put Cruz on blast.\n\n\u201cDid you see (the) Senator from Oklahoma just came out with a statement, one of the most incredible statements, here\u2019s a guy who came out with such an unbelievably strong statement that Ted Cruz is the most dishonest person in the Senate,\u201d Trump said, with boos being elicited from the mention of Cruz. \u201cLike the most incredible statement. He\u2019s a Republican that just came out. What I\u2019m telling you is true \u2013 I\u2019ve never seen a human being lie so much. He lies about everything. He\u2019ll take your record, like I talk to about ObamaCare. He\u2019ll say Trump loves ObamaCare, that I love ObamaCare, how do you fight that? I hate ObamaCare, it\u2019s going to be terminated.\u201d\n\nAs it comes to international trade, Trump said China devalues its currency and that it is the \u201cgreatest money manipulators ever.\u201d Specifically, he cautioned about Boeing\u2019s plant in China and what that could mean for South Carolina.\n\n\u201cBe careful because China, in order to get an order of plans, is making Boeing build this massive plant in China,\u201d he said. \u201cWon\u2019t happen if I\u2019m president, by the way, all of a sudden you\u2019ll come up and say \u2018You know, Boeing wants to move all of their production to China and they\u2019re going to be closing up.\u2019 This is the way it works folks, and you\u2019re sitting there saying \u2018Oh, that couldn\u2019t happen,\u2019 it can happen really easily. ... What they\u2019re doing is genius. They\u2019re world-class chess players with devaluation. Our country doesn\u2019t even know what to do.\u201d\n\nAs the Republican race thins, Trump said he can win in places that the GOP has historically struggled.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re No. 1, I\u2019ve been No. 1 almost since I announced because I did a great job,\u201d he said. \u201cI built a great company. I employ thousands of people. I\u2019ve employed tens of thousands of people over the years in places like Mexico. I have so many Hispanics working for me that I think I\u2019m going to win the Hispanics. I think I\u2019m going to win places like Michigan that aren\u2019t even in play for the Republicans. You know, the Republicans; it\u2019s very hard to win because structurally you\u2019re at a big disadvantage. You have a lot of disadvantages, I\u2019m going to bring states into play and win them easily that aren\u2019t even in play. Polls are coming out saying that I beat Hillary so many, I mean I beat Hillary and I haven\u2019t even started on her yet.\n\n\u201cThis guy Cruz comes out \u2018Well, I don\u2019t think he\u2019s going to win.\u2019 This guy is so strident and so nasty he\u2019s going to lose every single state. Then Bush, poor Bush, he comes out \u2018Well, I don\u2019t think that Donald Trump can beat Hillary Clinton, but I can.\u2019 I say, \u2018Well, why aren\u2019t you beating me?\u2019\u201d\n\nTrump concluded his speech by promising those in attendance that they \u201cwould remember this day.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to say this is one of the great days of my life,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause this was the beginning of making America great again.\u201d\n\nScott Rodgers is the news editor at The North Augusta Star and has been with the paper since 2013.
