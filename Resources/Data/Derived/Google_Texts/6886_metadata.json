Ted Yoho addressed questions and concerns during a town hall meeting hosted by the African American Accountability Alliance at the Alachua County Health Department Monday night.\n\nDarry Lloyd, president of the 4As, addressed the crowd of about 30 community members and explained that the discussion with Rep. Yoho would provide a platform for constituents to ask questions and express their needs.\n\n\u201cOur representative is here to talk with us and share what\u2019s going on from his experience,\u201d Lloyd said. \u201cAnd to listen to us about what we can do to assist him and what he can do to assist us.\u201d\n\nYoho said people want to be self-determinant, self-governing and self-reliant, and that they want a better life for themselves and for their children.\n\nHe also said the government is out of control and spending must be stopped before matters get worse.\n\nFollowing his opening statement, the 4as asked Yoho a series of prepared questions in which they voiced concerns about the actions he has taken while in office, as well as the statements he\u2019s made.\n\nMost of the discussion was focused on his support to defund the Affordable Care Act and his refusal to raise the debt ceiling.\n\nHe said that raising the debt ceiling won\u2019t help the US economy improve.\n\n\u201cIf raising the debt ceiling was the answer, we wouldn\u2019t have this discussion because we\u2019ve raised it 14 times since 2001,\u201d Yoho said, \u201cand all we\u2019ve done is gain more debt and more interest on our debt.\u201d\n\nDuring a question and answer session, the moderator cited a statistic from the census bureau stating that more than 16 percent of Yoho\u2019s district does not have health insurance.\n\nYoho responded by saying that the option of Medicaid and the emergency room exist, both of which have been taxing the system.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got the best healthcare in the world bar non,\u201d Yoho said. \u201cWhat I feel we need to fix is the delivery system.\u201d\n\nYoho said the Affordable Care Act has many flaws, including the lack of an income verification process. He said it shouldn\u2019t have been presented until all of the kinks were worked out.\n\nAudience members were allowed to ask Yoho direct questions at the end of the session.\n\nOne woman said that the Affordable Care Act would help her to attain healthcare, as she is currently uninsured.\n\nOthers asked why if he supports fiscal responsibility, he opted for a government shut down.\n\nYoho stuck by his ideals and reiterated that he was elected under his current platform and said it would be a disservice to those who elected him if he changed his views.\n\nHe said that those who elected him wanted him to act as he has.\n\n\u201cIf that changes to where people say, \u2018I don\u2019t want you to do that,\u2019 I won\u2019t run again,\u201d Yoho said.\n\nAlachua County School Board Member, Eileen Roy, attended the meeting and said she appreciated Yoho\u2019s effort to reach out to the community but was not satisfied with his answers.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m glad he had the courage to come here and face some tough questions,\u201d Roy said. \u201cI was not satisfied with his answers. He had a lot of statements that were flat out wrong.\u201d\n\nHowever, Yoho said Americans have always been good at coming together, specifically referencing the aftermath of Sept. 11.\n\n\u201cThere wasn\u2019t a white American; there wasn\u2019t a black American; there wasn\u2019t Republicans, Democrats, liberals or conservatives \u2014 we\u2019re all Americans,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m telling you \u2014 actually I\u2019m imploring you \u2014 we need to have that moment now.\u201d\n\nYoho will be up for reelection in 2014.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "WUFT News", "description": "U.S. Rep.
