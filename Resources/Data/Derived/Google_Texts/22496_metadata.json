Rick Scott and Democrat Charlie Crist kicked off the first of three debates with voters already casting ballots by mail and Election Day less than a month away.\n\nThroughout the nearly one-hour debate, both candidates attempted to solidify narratives they have been developing for months. For Scott, it was casting Crist as a flip-flopper while Crist tried to align Scott with special interests.\n\nScott tried to make the case that Crist \u201cnever lifted a finger\u201d as governor for things he now supports \u2014 an attempt to cast the Republican-turned-independent-turned-Democrat as inconsistent on policy issues.\n\n\u201cHe voted against raising the minimum wage, he did not raise a finger to lift the minimum wage,\u201d Scott said.\n\nScott opposes increasing the minimum wage, pointing to a federal study that says it would cost jobs.\n\nCrist says, if elected, he would push for a higher state minimum wage and would sign an executive order increasing the minimum wage to $10.10 for companies with state contracts.\n\nCrist criticized Scott for accepting millions of dollars in campaign contributions from insurance companies, some of whom supported Crist\u2019s past campaigns.\n\n\u201cHe actually signed a bill this year that says the Office of Insurance Regulation can\u2019t regulate insurance. That makes no sense, well, only if you follow the money,\u201d Crist said. \u201cThey have given him a lot of money for his campaign.\u201d\n\nThe debate was held at the Miramar studios of NBC 6/Telemundo 51. It was broadcast at 7 p.m. in Spanish on Telemundo stations in the Tampa, Miami, and Orlando markets, and live online in English.\n\nIt is the first Spanish-language gubernatorial debate in state history.\n\nLibertarian candidate Adrian Wyllie was denied a spot on the debate stage, which drew protests from a group of his sign-waving supporters outside the building.\n\nIssues directly affecting the state\u2019s Hispanics played a prominent role in the debate, including whether to give undocumented immigrants driver\u2019s licenses. Scott says a 2012 federal directive already allows children brought to the U.S. illegally as children to get licenses, while Crist says he wants to legalize the practice for all undocumented immigrations.\n\nThe debate offered a forum for the candidates to define themselves.\n\nScott, as he did during the 2010 campaign, went back to the story of his rise from humble beginnings in a poor family to become a multimillionaire health care executive.\n\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t have a lot of money in the bank,\u201d Scott said.\n\nCrist has tried to portray himself as the more empathetic candidate while at the same time casting Scott as uncaring.\n\n\u201cI think the biggest distinction is you\u2019ve got somebody who rattles off statistics versus somebody who really cares about people and what they\u2019re challenges are,\u201d Crist said.\n\nOn key issues, the first debate helped hammer home the distinction between the two. Some examples:\n\n\u2666 Crist says Florida is \u201cground zero for climate change,\u201d while Scott remains skeptical that global warming is occurring. When asked about the environment, he pointed to his administration\u2019s record funding for the Everglades.\n\n\u2666 Scott opposes a proposed constitutional amendment that would legalize medical marijuana, but signed legislation this spring legalizing a strain of marijuana that helps children with seizures. Crist supports the proposed amendment, which is bankrolled by attorney John Morgan. Crist works for Morgan\u2019s law form.\n\n\u2666 Crist supports expanding Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, while Scott opposes it and points to reforms under his administration that helped reign in state-level costs.\n\nThe two candidates will square off two more times, with the next debate Oct. 15 at Broward College.\n\nMatt.Dixon@naplesnews.com\n\n(352) 233-0777", "article_metadata": {"taboola-pub-time": "Fri, 10 Oct 2014 16:48:11 -0400", "Description": "A testy back-and-forth between Gov.
