Bobby Jindal said Monday he disagreed with fellow Republican presidential hopeful Donald Trump\u2019s controversial comments about Mexican immigrants, but refused to join those who have condemned the New York business executive.\n\nBobby Jindal Bobby Jindal (R) is a candidate for president in 2016. More\n\nJindal spoke to reporters near Manchester City Hall before being escorted by Mayor Ted Gatsas in visiting several businesses on Elm Street. He was in the second of a three-day visit to the state.\n\nJindal said he does not \u201cview people as ethnic groups or by their economic background. I see people as individuals.\u201d\n\nTrump has been criticized by other Republicans running for president since he said, while announcing his candidacy on June 16, that Mexico is \u201csending people that have lots of problems, and they\u2019re bringing those problems to us. They\u2019re bringing drugs. They\u2019re bringing crime. They\u2019re rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.\u201d\n\n\u201cI do think we need to secure our border,\u201d Jindal said, \u201cand I do think that immigration can either make our country stronger or weaker.\u201d\n\nJindal said that his top priority on the immigration issues is securing the border.\n\nAfter that is accomplished, he said, \u201cWe do need to make it easier for people who want to come here legally. But people who want to come here should have to come legally, should have to learn English, should have to adopt our values and then roll up their sleeves and get to work.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m tired of all the hyphenated Americans,\u201d Jindal said. \u201cI disagree with the comments. I view people as individuals, but I also think we need to adopt a stronger, smarter immigration policy.\u201d\n\nJindal would not say whether he believes Trump disqualified himself from running for president with his comments.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not here to police the other candidates,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m here to beat the other candidates.\u201d\n\nJindal also said he is concerned about the United States\u2019 \u201cdescent into socialism. The path we\u2019re on now is to turn the American dream into a European nightmare.\u2019\u2019\n\n\u201cOur future is Greece if we don\u2019t change our ways,\u201d he said. \u201cStop spending money we don\u2019t have. We need to shrink the size of government and grow the private sector economy.\"\n\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t do those things, we\u2019ll become Greece,\u201d Jindal said.\n\nJindal said Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, a U.S. senator from Vermont, \u201cis honest. At least he\u2019s willing to call himself a socialist. That\u2019s where Hillary Clinton wants to take us. She just doesn\u2019t call herself that.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Greeks gave us democracy,\u201d Jindal said. \u201cNow they are trying to kill one off by spending beyond their means. We need to get off that pathway.\u201d\n\nJindal said he is confident that he can distinguish himself from the other candidates in the crowded field.\n\n\u201cWe need a doer not a talker,\u201d Jindal said. \u201cYou have a lot of talkers running for president. You already have a talker in the White House. If talk was good enough, we\u2019d be doing great as a country.\"\n\nHe said his \u201cproven track record\u201d includes having cut his state\u2019s budget by 26 percent and eliminating 30,000 state government positions. We\u2019re a top 10 state for private sector job creation.\u201d\n\nJindal said Republicans \u201cneed to embrace our own principles.\u201d\n\nJindal noted that former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush said in December that a Republican nominee should \u201close the primary to win the general without violating your principles.\u201d\n\n\u201cI disagree with that,\u201d Jindal said. \u201cWhat I hear when he says that is that we have to hide our conservative principles, and try to get the left and the media to like us. That never works.\u201d\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s be true to our principles,\u201d Jindal said. \u201dLet\u2019s show the American people we are willing to fight for what we believe in. Let\u2019s shrink the size of government, but let\u2019s also win the war against ISIS, stand with Israel and stop allowing Iran to become a nuclear power.\u201d\n\n\u201cLots of Republicans will promise things,\u201d Jindal said. \u201cWe have done things. I\u2019m the only one with a specific plan for repealing and replacing Obamacare, for example.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"category": "Politics", "ib-analytics": "data", "item-publish-date": "Mon, 06 Jul 2015 19:09:45 EDT", "generator": "ibPublish 2", "author": "John DiStaso", "og": {"site_name": "WMUR", "description": "Louisiana Gov.
