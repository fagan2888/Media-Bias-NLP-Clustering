A Watchdog.org investigation found that officials there had been lining their pockets with unearned pay.\n\nThe NMA, founded in 1982, advocates for speed limits that reflect actual driving patterns.\n\n\u201cAccording to an Institute of Transportation Engineers Study, those driving 10 mph slower than the prevailing speed are six times as likely to be involved in an accident,\u201d the group writes, \u201cthan someone going 70 or even 80 mph.\u201d\n\nThe town of Estelline in West Texas, which the group named the \u201cWorst Speed Trap City\u201d in the country in 2012, has run into other problems associated with policing for profit. In 2014, the city paid a $77,500 settlement to a woman after arresting her on made up drug charges and seizing $29,000 in proceeds she had from a property sale.\n\nOriginally published at Watchdog.org.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Texas is infested with more speed traps than any other state, according to a new study.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Texas is infested with more speed traps than any other state, according to a new study.", "title": "How Texas Became America's No. 1 Speed-Trap State", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/151221_TexasSpeed.jpg", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1Qrz5cn"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Texas is infested with more speed traps than any other state, according to a new study.", "creator": "@dailysignal", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/151221_TexasSpeed.jpg"}, "title": "How Texas Became America's No. 1 Speed-Trap State", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Law", "tag": "overcriminalization", "published_time": "2015-12-21T15:06:23+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "texas,speed traps,policing for profit,law enforcement,transportation,highways"}, "article_summary": "Texas is infested with more speed traps than any other state, according to a new study by the National Motorists Association.\nThe NMA compiled five years\u2019 worth of data from a website it maintains, The National Speed Trap Exchange, and found Texas had far and away the highest speed trap count, with 1,383 locations.\n\u201cSpeed traps typically combine arbitrarily low speed limits with heavy traffic enforcement designed to generate ticket revenue,\u201d the NMA wrote.\nVarious investigations in recent years have confirmed that Texas has a problem with small towns that try to fill their coffers by fining people passing along state highways.\nState law restricts cities with fewer than 5,000 residents from collecting more than 30 percent of their revenue from traffic tickets."}
