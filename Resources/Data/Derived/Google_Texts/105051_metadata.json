New foreclosure filings in Colorado fell nearly 60 percent last year compared with 2012, according to a report Thursday from RealtyTrac.\n\nEstimates vary on how much prices might increase this year, although the expectation is that the gains will be more modest than last year\u2019s.\n\nDenver home prices should gain on average another 6 percent to 7 percent, predicts John Hauber, ZipRealty\u2019s district director for Colorado.\n\nSeattle-based Zillow, which provides a popular website to estimate home values, is calling for Denver home prices to rise 2.1 percent in 2014 after what it calculates as a 9.3 percent gain last year.\n\nAnother check on the housing market is higher interest rates. When mortgage rates dropped below 3.5 percent late in 2012, that set the stage for last year\u2019s feeding frenzy, which only intensified when buyers realized the market was bottoming out.\n\nThirty-year mortgage rates, which Freddie Mac has at 4.4 percent, could top 5 percent as the year goes on, especially if the economy gains traction and depending on how aggressively the Fed \u201ctapers\u201d its purchases of mortgage and government debt securities.\n\n\u201cThe availability of credit is the wild card,\u201d said Jed Kolko, chief economist with Trulia.\n\nNew consumer-protection rules that took effect this month limit more exotic mortgage types and put more pressure on lenders to prove borrowers can afford to repay the loans they are taking on. The Federal Housing Administration is also cutting down the size of the loans it is willing to fund in more expensive housing markets.\n\nBut other trends are expected to keep buyers in the game. Rising rents and lower vacancy rates are increasing the pressure on renters to lock in a monthly payment by buying.\n\nAn improving job market should allow more people to afford homes, especially young adults, who have been held back by poor job prospects and heavy college debts.\n\nMetro Denver remains one of the more popular destinations for young adults looking to relocate.\n\nAnother support for the existing-home market is the restrained comeback in new construction. Single-family permits in the state peaked at 40,753 in 2004 but by 2009 were at 7,261. The CU-Boulder Business Economic Outlook calls for them to reach 20,000 this year, half the old peak.\n\nGoing into 2014, real estate firm Redfin points out five Denver neighborhoods especially popular with home hunters: City Park; the Skyland neighborhood to the north; the Wadsworth corridor south of Interstate 70; Kipling Street north of U.S. 6; and the Applewood Valley area.\n\nThose neighborhoods share an older housing stock needing updating, direct routes into downtown Denver or proximity to the mountains, and neighborhoods with character, said Paul Stone, a senior agent with Redfin in Denver.\n\nAldo Svaldi: 303-954-1410, asvaldi@denverpost.com or twitter.com/aldosvaldi", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Denver housing market seen as finding balance in 2014", "title": "Denver housing market seen as finding balance in 2014", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/01/17/denver-housing-market-seen-as-finding-balance-in-2014/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140117__20140119_K1_BZ19HOMEFORECASTp1-2.jpg", "height": 454}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140117__20140119_K1_BZ19HOMEFORECASTp1-2.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-01-17T21:36:57+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-28T06:19:38+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1f9d\"", "article_summary": "A supply greater than six months of sales is considered a buyer\u2019s market, while less than three months, the case last year, represents a seller\u2019s market, Blank said.\nAnother check on the housing market is higher interest rates.\nLast year, historically low mortgage rates met a tight inventory of homes available for sale, tipping the balance heavily in favor of sellers.\nHe and others expect the Denver market, still among the tightest in the country, will get above a three-month supply as more sellers come out of hiding this spring.\nOne metric to watch is the number of homes available for sale versus the number of homes sold in a month, a measure of balance in the market."}
