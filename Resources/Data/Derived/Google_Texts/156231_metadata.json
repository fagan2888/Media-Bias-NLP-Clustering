The 27-year-old has 41 tattoos of the loveable oaf on his body, but the most interesting aspect of his bizarre ode to Springfield\u2019s most infamous citizen is that as a child he wasn\u2019t actually allowed to watch the show.\n\nWeir has now revealed that his father was the \u201creal-life Ned Flanders,\u201d and that he was so strict he wouldn\u2019t let his son watch the show at all because it depicted Homer, the head of the Simpson family as a \u201cbuffoon.\u201d\n\nHowever this didn\u2019t stop Lee\u2019s love of the show from blossoming, and he became so enamoured with the goings on at the Simpson\u2019s household that he started to have the characters tattooed onto his skin. This devotion has continued to grow and he now has over three dozen tattoos of The Simpsons.\n\nYou can check out his official Guinness World Record certificate below:\n\n@therealbeauryan @NRL hope you join the @GWR club. pic.twitter.com/0hWUTE6KiS \u2014 Lee Weir (@LeeWeird) July 13, 2014\n\nDiscussing his history with the show, Weir explained, \u201cI was never allowed to watch The Simpsons growing up as my dad was a real life Ned Flanders. He wouldn\u2019t let me watch as it depicted the father and the head of the household to be a buffoon.\u201d\n\nHe then added, \u201cBut I\u2019ve always enjoyed watching the show in later life and it feels incredible to be a record breaker. My two-year-old daughter Lucy can point out different Homer tattoos on my arm \u2013 her favorite is \u2018baby Homer.\u2019 To have a record for something that is not only cool but also very close to me is just brilliant.\u201d\n\nDespite his new-found celebrity status, Weir admits that it hasn\u2019t actually changed him, as he insists, \u201cIt hasn\u2019t made me a better person but I definitely think it has made me a slightly cooler one.\u201d\n\nWeir added that all of his tattoos were actually completed by a tattooist friend of his, Ben Jenkins, and that they took over 25 hours to actually complete. In order to be officially labelled a Guinness World Record holder though, Weir had to provide dermatology reports to the institution, and he was officially announced as a world record holder on June 5.\n\nWhat do you think of Lee Weir\u2019s Simpsons tattoos?\n\n[Images via Twitter]", "article_metadata": {"description": "A fanatic of The Simpsons has entered the record-books after he got yet another tattoo of Homer Simpson onto his arm. 41-year-old Lee Weir of Auckland, New", "og": {"site_name": "The Inquisitr News", "description": "A fanatic of The Simpsons has entered the record-books after he got yet another tattoo of Homer Simpson onto his arm. 41-year-old Lee Weir of Auckland, New", "title": "\u2018The Simpsons\u2019 Super-Fan Breaks World Record: Has 41 Homer Tattoos", "url": "http://www.inquisitr.com/1363884/the-simpsons-super-fan-breaks-world-record-with-homer-tattoo/", "image": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Simp-2.jpg.jpg", "article": {"published_time": "2014-07-20T17:58:13+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-07-20T17:59:22+00:00"}, "type": "article"}, "image": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Simp-2.jpg.jpg", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ed1c24", "datePublished": "2014-07-20T17:58:13+00:00", "fb": {"app_id": 164157850314499, "pages": 71179904752}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/assets/0cec37/dist/images/logos/inq-win.png", "keywords": "lee weir,the simpsons,the simpsons tattoo,the simpsons world record,tv", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "y_key": "f282393706a5fd85", "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Simp-2.jpg.jpg", "width": 670, "height": 409}, "site": "@theinquisitr", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "A fanatic of The Simpsons has entered the record-books after he got yet another tattoo of Homer Simpson onto his arm. 41-year-old Lee Weir of Auckland, New"}, "viewport": "width=980"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd73fa\"", "article_summary": "In order to be officially labelled a Guinness World Record holder though, Weir had to provide dermatology reports to the institution, and he was officially announced as a world record holder on June 5.\nYou can check out his official Guinness World Record certificate below:@therealbeauryan @NRL hope you join the @GWR club.\n41-year-old Lee Weir of Auckland, New Zealand, now has the honor of being the world record holder for having the most tattoos of the same cartoon character tattooed on his body.\nWhat do you think of Lee Weir\u2019s Simpsons tattoos?\nA fanatic of The Simpsons has entered the record-books after he got yet another tattoo of Homer Simpson onto his arm."}
