The science behind building your ideal six-pack comes down to a very simple formula, but one that is often snubbed by overzealous gym rats. Reduced fat + enlarged abdominal muscles = six-pack. The best abdominal workout in the world is useless on someone who does not consume the right type of diet.\n\nSo what food should you eat to develop a six-pack? For your best six-pack-building protein sources, pick up some eggs, chicken, oily fish, and Greek Yogurt. Brown bread and brown rice are a great source of complex carbohydrates, but avoid simple carbohydrates, such as white pasta, white rice, and processed food. Consume at least 150 grams of protein a day and if you\u2019re not into eating oily fish pick up some fish oil supplements which can increase the amount of lean muscle you\u2019re putting on.\n\nIn terms of exercise, it\u2019s time to do away with crunches. This outdated ab exercise will only help you achieve damaged spinal discs and lower back pain. Instead of exercises that require you to lay down, try upright exercises which are more effective at engaging your core. Some upright exercises to consider include hanging leg raises, medicine ball leg drops, and kneeling cable crunch. Also, if you\u2019re worried about getting a gym membership, sprinting, skipping, and other fat-burning exercises can be performed almost anywhere.\n\nby Designbysoap.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "how, get, six, pack, plus, 5, myths, about, body, fat", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Here are some dieting and exercise tips to help achieve your ideal six-pack.", "title": "How To Get A Six-Pack, Plus 5 Myths About Body Fat [INFOGRAPHIC]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/how-get-six-pack-plus-5-myths-about-body-fat-323836", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured/public/2015/02/27/how-get-six-pack.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Here are some dieting and exercise tips to help achieve your ideal six-pack.", "title": "How To Get A Six-Pack, Plus 5 Myths About Body Fat [INFOGRAPHIC]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/how-get-six-pack-plus-5-myths-about-body-fat-323836", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured/public/2015/02/27/how-get-six-pack.png", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/02/27/how-get-six-pack.png"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-02-27T14:30:34-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-03-02T11:54:08-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Here are some dieting and exercise tips to help achieve your ideal six-pack."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc6e9\"", "article_summary": "Instead of exercises that require you to lay down, try upright exercises which are more effective at engaging your core.\nSome upright exercises to consider include hanging leg raises, medicine ball leg drops, and kneeling cable crunch.\nBrown bread and brown rice are a great source of complex carbohydrates, but avoid simple carbohydrates, such as white pasta, white rice, and processed food.\nBy now you\u2019ve tried every \u201cHow To Get A Six-Pack In 30 Days\u201d challenge you\u2019ve come across with the same disheartening result: a no-pack.\nThe science behind building your ideal six-pack comes down to a very simple formula, but one that is often snubbed by overzealous gym rats."}
