Numerous accidents happened on roads across Kansas Sunday after a round of winter weather passes through.

Sedgwick County 911 Dispatch Operators report 50 accidents happened as of 4:00 p.m. on Sunday.

Alan King is the director of Wichita Public Works and Utilities and says that all 50 of his snow plows will be in operation, applying a salt/sand mixture and plowing snow where necessary.

"We are most concerned about the very low temperatures, so we want to make sure we stay ahead of this," King said referencing the need to remove all the moisture from the road before forecast single digit temperatures enter the area tonight.

Wichita Public Schools, USD 259 tell KAKE News that they are monitoring the weather conditions.
