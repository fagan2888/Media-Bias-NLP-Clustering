He wants the U.S. to reduce its emissions of carbon dioxide, and the EPA has done its best to bring this about via increasingly stringent regulations on coal-fired power plants. The Democrats wanted to enact cap-and-trade, but couldn\u2019t get it through Congress, so Obama is doing the best he can through administrative action. Simultaneously, the administration has poured billions of dollars into specious \u201cgreen\u201d energy projects, many of which can\u2019t be kept alive even with lavish subsidies, although their developers always walk away with their pockets full.\n\nBut why? Even if we assume that the climateers\u2019 bogus models reflect scientific reality rather than left-wing politics\u2013an assumption that is plainly contrary to fact\u2013does any plausible reduction in American CO2 emissions make any difference?\n\nThe answer is: no, it doesn\u2019t. If the climate alarmists\u2019 models are correct, then the Obama administration\u2019s efforts to reduce CO2 emissions are pointless.\n\nEd Hoskins explains at Watts Up With That?:\n\nThe USA, simply by exploiting shale gas for electricity generation, has already reduced its CO2 emissions by some 9.5% since 2005. That alone has already had more CO2 emission reduction effect than the entire Kyoto protocol.\n\nBut the US\u2019s emissions reductions are irrelevant. These two charts tell the story. First, a simple comparison of CO2 emissions from developed and underdeveloped countries:\n\nDo India, China et al. have any interest in keeping their citizens in poverty to make the climateers happy? No. As Hoskins points out, 25% of India\u2019s population still has no access to electric power. CO2 production in the underdeveloped world will continue to skyrocket, and there is nothing we can do about it.\n\nThis chart shows how China\u2019s CO2 emission has eclipsed that of the U.S., as well as Europe, Japan, and so on. Any marginal reduction that the U.S. might achieve, short of going out of existence entirely (as some liberals might prefer for other reasons), simply won\u2019t matter:\n\nHoskins notes Bjorn Lomborg\u2019s calculation that if the climateers\u2019 disaster scenarios are correct, then Germany\u2019s investment of $100 billion in solar power schemes \u201ccan only reduce the onset of Global Warming by a matter of about 37 hours by the year 2100.\u201d A similar calculation would show the futility of the Obama administration\u2019s \u201cgreen\u201d initiatives.\n\nSo what\u2019s the point? I don\u2019t have a high opinion of President Obama\u2019s abilities, but he isn\u2019t a complete idiot. So I assume he understands that his war on CO2, and his provision of billions of dollars in subsidies to \u201cgreen\u201d energy, won\u2019t make any perceptible difference to the Earth\u2019s climate, if you assume the alarmists\u2019 models are correct. So why does he do it? I think there are two reasons.\n\nFirst, the Left has made an enormous investment in promoting misinformation about global warming. You can\u2019t get through elementary school in the U.S. without being hectored about your family\u2019s carbon footprint. (\u201cI will never live in a house bigger than John Edwards\u2019,\u201d my then-third-grade daughter wrote in response to a question about what she, personally, intended to do to change the Earth\u2019s climate.) Those millions of misinformed people are now voters, and Obama is secure in the knowledge that the newspapers and television networks haven\u2019t done anything to educate them.\n\nSecond, to the Obama administration, the fact that \u201cgreen\u201d energy cannot survive without government subsidies and mandates isn\u2019t a bug, it\u2019s a feature. It allows the Democrats to slide billions of dollars to their cronies, like Tom Steyer, the left-wing billionaire who is now the number one financial supporter of the Democratic Party. Steyer made his first fortune by developing coal projects, and is making his second fortune as a Democratic Party crony, developing uneconomic but heavily subsidized \u201cgreen\u201d energy projects. So the war on coal and other sources of CO2, while it can\u2019t have any impact at all on the climate, has turned into a funding mechanism for the Democratic Party.\n\nNext time someone produces a dictionary and is looking for a definition of the word \u201ccynic,\u201d all he needs is a picture of Barack Obama.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Power Line", "description": "As his policies, foreign and domestic, are collapsing on pretty much every front, President Obama has increasingly sought refuge in talk about global warming.
