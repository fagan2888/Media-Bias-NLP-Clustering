Even some of his Marxist minions who had previously followed his orders and believed his lies without question are now, if even ever so slightly, beginning to query his judgment and motives. Since 2009, I have been writing and saying on-air that it was and is Barack Hussein Obama's intent to replace any and all Shiite Muslim leadership with that of the Sunni Muslim Brotherhood (: Obama's \"family\" members are leaders in the Kenyan branch of the Muslim Brotherhood). That is precisely what he is doing, now, and has been affecting since the beginning of his reign as Dictator-in-Chief of the \"New American [Obama] Colonies.\"With his new and yet to be fully realized Syrian adventure (the \"Sunni conversion\" in Egypt and Libya was already \"in the can\" for Obama...until the people of Egypt rebelled against it), Obama must continue to work toward toppling Ba'athist leader and Shiite Muslim Bashar Assad and replacing him with an MB operative; no matter what he has to do to accomplish it. As each day passes and Obama becomes bolder in his foreign policy insanity, his actual personal membership in the Muslim Brotherhood seem increasingly obvious. Yet, those who know it in the media and Congress refuse to allow any of its members to speak the truth that is directly in front of them. And, with his favorable numbers on the wane in a distinct downward slide, The Obama syndicate must work even more quickly to establish its Police State and subjugate the population of the former United States of America.The ObamaGov has, for the last several years, been buying up hundreds of thousands of guns and billions of rounds of ammo. Why\" Virtually all of government departments have now been armed to the teeth with said guns and ammo. Obama's Gestapo will be the biggest \"private army\" of any dictator in the history of the world. In August, the now fully-militarized and heavily armed EPA raided an Alaska gold mine with SWAT teams, under the guise of enforcing the Clean Water Act.Fully armed US National Park Rangers are now being used in cities to stop protests and opposition to any of Obama's policies. There have been others but, the most recently reported is that of Army Iraq-war veteran Emily Yates who was violently arrested by 4 armed Park Rangers for playing her banjo and singing a song opposing Obama's planned invasion and attack on Syria. While she was calmly talking to the camera, the rangers pounced on her from behind, jerked her arms behind her back and shoved her against a bench. The police shout \"stop resisting and stop kicking!!!\" The video clearly shows she is offering little if any resistance and is certainly in no position to kick anyone. The USA IS a police state now, folks. And we-the-people seem to be going along with it on the same path the Germans took while Adolph Hitler was vanquishing all of Germany and then went after other countries. In fear, the German people willingly gave up their guns and when trains transporting Jews to the camps and their deaths rolled by Christian churches on Sundays the congregations simply sang louder so they drowned out the cries for help!There are only two countries which have ever existed on Planet Earth that were founded on the principles and reality of the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. The first was the promised land grant Israel) to the Hebrews and founded by God (YHWH) Himself. The second was the United States of America, which was founded by Jewish and Christian men and women. Both Israel and the United States of America were unique to the planet. Only Israel still holds that position.On the other hand, all dictatorships have the same definitive characteristics. First, their campaigns appeal to the poor, under educated and those like-minded criminal entities who will benefit from the election of an authoritarian leader. These dictators-in-training then begin vilifying the wealthy (always happens), talk about giving the money the \"rich\" have legally earned to the \"poor\" who refuse to work. Instead, these \"leaders\" are planning ways to steal the money for themselves, while giving the poor a few crumbs...if they're lucky. Then, if people react too strongly and negatively to their enslavement...they are exterminated. This happens each and every time under dictatorships and oligarchies. After the above actions have been implemented, it gets even worse. Dictators then bleed everything from the country possible until only the shell of the nation \u2013 and fewer people \u2013 are left. Those who are left live in generational slavery. Want examples? Here are a few: Leninist Russia, Stalinist USSR, NAZI Germany, any country in the Middle East where the Muslim Brotherhood and its affiliates rules, Mussolini's Italy, Cambodia under Pol Pot, Communist China, North Korea, Cuba etc. Now, tragically and horrifically, under the Obama criminal syndicate the [former] USA is fast on the way to joining their ranks. And, as Obama's poll numbers continue to fall, our own dictator-in-chief's staff (Obama is likely out on the links) working feverishly to complete its Police State takeover.There is only one way to non-violently take back our country if we're really willing to do it. I've been writing about it off and on for years. Talk show host Mark Levin just published a book about it. The States must begin taking their power back from the federal government. Too many unconstitutional laws have been written and passed by Congress (with no input from the people it is supposed to), one of which is the \"War Powers Act of 1941\" which is unconstitutional in virtually every way; from Congress illegally giving some of its power to the Executive branch (only Congress has the power/authority to declare war) to bypassing thelegal way to change the US Constitution...by Amendment. The solution? First and foremost, we must return to the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. We must, also, return to the US Constitution or be lost forever as a free and sovereign county. If we no longer have the courage to follow and fight for the only legal document to found our nation as and for a free people we are toast as a country.The States and the American people have the legal right and authority to trump the federal government on almost every level. The Tenth Amendment (Bill of Rights) states \"The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.\" And what are the powers Constitutionally allowed to the federal government? See Article I, Section 8 (link below). All other powers are reserved to the States and We-the-People. And, our first founding legal document the \"Declaration of Independence\" gives us the ultimate power to divest ourselves of and from a tyrannical and corrupt government:It continues with:The above is not just an option, folks. Under our Republic \u2013 as damaged as it now is \u2013 this is our duty. Obama is arming and militarizing all of his governmental agencies to come against us. It's in the open. Will you continue to ignore it until you and your loved ones are in imminent danger and are likely killed by your own government? Will you really let this slide anymore than it already has? If we do not do this through leadership in our States, we will be forced to do it in our streets. It is what it is...\"The Lord shall deliver me from every evil work, and will preserve me unto his heavenly kingdom: to whom be glory for ever and ever\" \u2013 2 Timothy 4:18: There are simply too many ObamaGov Police State actions going on to talk about, here. As they are increasing exponentially each week if not day, it would take a book to go into even most of them. However, I've listed many new ones \u2013 including a College student being attacked by police for buying a \"six-pack\" of bottled water.\u00a9 Sher Zieve", "article_metadata": {"description": "Obama's popularity has finally begun to tumble.
