About half of the respondents reported high levels of activity throughout the study. In 1976, 20 percent reported being sedentary, which decreased to 10 percent in 2001.\n\nThe researchers linked these questionnaire responses to national patient registries of all people given outpatient treatment or admitted to a hospital for an alcohol use disorder in Denmark through 2011.\n\nBy the end of the study, 736 people, or four percent of the original group, had been diagnosed with an alcohol use disorder. People who reported low or high levels of leisure time activity had similar risks for an alcohol use disorder, but people in the sedentary group had a higher risk, the authors write in Alcohol and Alcoholism.\n\nMen and women who reported at least low levels of physical activity were 30 to 40 percent less likely to be diagnosed with an alcohol use disorder than those in the sedentary group.\n\nActivity at work was not associated with alcohol use disorders, the authors write.\n\n\u201cThese results strengthen the general recommendation of increased physical activity and add to the long list of beneficial effects of physical activity,\u201d Becker said.\n\nLikely more than half of what determines alcohol use disorders is genetic, but environmental factors, like physical activity, are also important, he said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an interesting observational study and demonstrates there\u2019s some correlation,\u201d said Michael T. French, who was not part of the new study but directs the Health Economics Research Group at the University of Miami.\n\nFrench studied a large group of U.S. adults in 2009 and found that heavier drinkers tended to exercise more, which does not align with the new results.\n\n\u201cLike the study of ours, the most you can say is that there seems to be an association,\u201d French told Reuters Health by phone. Their findings may have differed because French\u2019s study included a range of alcohol use, whereas Becker\u2019s study was limited to the most extreme drinkers who ended up hospitalized, he said.\n\n\u201cThey are hypothesizing that less physical activity or a sedentary lifestyle is going to affect your risk of an alcohol use disorder,\u201d French said. \u201cIt\u2019s equally possible that acquiring a disorder is going to lead to a sedentary lifestyle.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey decided they\u2019re going to look at physical activity as predictors, but we thought it was more plausible to look in the other direction,\u201d he said.\n\nFrench stressed that at this point, trying to explain why activity influences alcohol disorders, or vice versa, is only conjecture.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an interesting topic, worth exploring, but I would be cautious when interpreting the results,\u201d he said.\n\nSOURCE: http://bit.ly/1FvDo1v Alcohol and Alcoholism, online December 27, 2014.\n\n(By Kathryn Doyle)", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "being, active, tied, lower, alcoholism, risk", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "People who exercised regularly throughout life were less likely to need treatment for alcohol abuse, a study from Denmark finds.", "title": "Being Active Tied To Lower Alcoholism Risk", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/being-active-tied-lower-alcoholism-risk-317202", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/01/10/man-running.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "People who exercised regularly throughout life were less likely to need treatment for alcohol abuse, a study from Denmark finds.", "title": "Being Active Tied To Lower Alcoholism Risk", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/being-active-tied-lower-alcoholism-risk-317202", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/01/10/man-running.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/01/10/man-running.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Vitality", "published_time": "2015-01-10T10:41:10-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-01-10T10:42:10-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "People who exercised regularly throughout life were less likely to need treatment for alcohol abuse, a study from Denmark finds."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3ecc\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThese results strengthen the general recommendation of increased physical activity and add to the long list of beneficial effects of physical activity,\u201d Becker said.\n\u201cWe know from other studies that physical activity reduces the risk of other psychiatric problems .\n(Reuters Health) - Getting more exercise throughout life is tied to a reduced risk of abusing alcohol that requires treatment, according to a new study from Denmark.\n\u201cThey are hypothesizing that less physical activity or a sedentary lifestyle is going to affect your risk of an alcohol use disorder,\u201d French said.\nLikely more than half of what determines alcohol use disorders is genetic, but environmental factors, like physical activity, are also important, he said."}
