Saleski went to Cadillac Ranch on July 6, 2013 and paid to ride a mechanical bull called \u201cOld Thunder.\u201d Saleski was thrown from the bull and hit his head, causing severe neck pain, displaced fractures of two vertebrae and injury to his vertebral artery.\n\nThe lawsuit alleges that the bull was positioned up against a wall and that Cadillac Ranch should have known the placement was dangerous. The restaurant \u201cfailed to adequately pad the landing area adjacent to the mechanical bull to prevent foreseeable injuries,\u201d according to the lawsuit.\n\nCadillac Ranch manager Graham Nicholson said they've had the mechanical bull for seven years, there's an air mattress around it, and they have never had reports of anyone being injured.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s virtually impossible to get hurt on,\u201d Nicholson said. \u201dIn the seven years we\u2019ve had it, there\u2019s never been an accident.\u201d\n\nThe suit claims that Cadillac Ranch did not warn patrons about the hazards of riding the bull, neglected to properly train mechanical bull operators and did not take necessary safety precautions.\n\nAccording to the lawsuit, Saleski has required ongoing medical treatment that has dealt him a financial blow. He\u2019s seeking unspecified monetary damages.\n\nMeadow Muffins LLC, the company that operates Cadillac Ranch, filed a motion on Feb. 3 asking the court for more time to respond to Saleski\u2019s lawsuit. According to the motion, the defendant \u201cneeds additional time to investigate the allegations\u201d and is asking for a plea deadline of April 3.\n\nNicholson said everyone who rides the mechanical bull signs a waiver and the restaurant has presented a signed statement that Saleski signed it.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A man who visited the Cadillac Ranch Restaurant in Southington in 2013 is suing the establishment after falling from a mechanical bull and suffering \u201cpainful, permanent, serious injuries,\u201d according to a lawsuit...", "title": "Man Sues Cadillac Ranch Over Alleged Mechanical Bull Injury", "og": {"site_name": "NBC Connecticut", "description": "A man who visited the Cadillac Ranch Restaurant in Southington in 2013 is suing the establishment after falling from a mechanical bull and suffering \u201cpainful, permanent, serious injuries,\u201d according to a lawsuit...", "title": "Man Sues Cadillac Ranch Over Alleged Mechanical Bull Injury", "url": "http://www.nbcconnecticut.com/news/local/Man-Sues-Cadillac-Ranch-Over-Mechanical-Bull-Injury-292108621.html", "image": "http://media.nbcconnecticut.com/images/1200*675/Cadillac+ranch+mechanical+bull+2+1200.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A man who visited the Cadillac Ranch Restaurant in Southington in 2013 is suing the establishment after falling from a mechanical bull and suffering \u201cpainful, permanent, serious injuries,\u201d according to a lawsuit...", "title": "Man Sues Cadillac Ranch Over Alleged Mechanical Bull Injury", "url": "http://www.nbcconnecticut.com/news/local/Man-Sues-Cadillac-Ranch-Over-Mechanical-Bull-Injury-292108621.html", "image": "http://media.nbcconnecticut.com/images/1200*675/Cadillac+ranch+mechanical+bull+2+1200.jpg?ak=bc", "creator": "@nbcconnecticut", "site": "@nbcconnecticut", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "tp": {"preferredRuntimes": "Flash,HTML5", "FlashBlacklist": "None|None", "preferredFormats": "mpeg4,m3u,webm,ogg,flv,F4M"}, "fb": {"app_id": 81242742459}, "keywords": "cadillac ranch,southington,mechanical bull,lawsuit", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/NBCConnecticut"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "cadillac ranch,southington,mechanical bull,lawsuit"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3245\"", "article_summary": "Cadillac Ranch manager Graham Nicholson said they've had the mechanical bull for seven years, there's an air mattress around it, and they have never had reports of anyone being injured.\nThe lawsuit alleges that the bull was positioned up against a wall and that Cadillac Ranch should have known the placement was dangerous.\nMeadow Muffins LLC, the company that operates Cadillac Ranch, filed a motion on Feb. 3 asking the court for more time to respond to Saleski\u2019s lawsuit.\nA man who visited the Cadillac Ranch Restaurant in Southington in 2013 is suing the establishment, saying he fell from a mechanical bull and suffered \u201cpainful, permanent, serious injuries,\u201d according to a lawsuit filed on Jan. 12.\nNicholson said everyone who rides the mechanical bull signs a waiver and the restaurant has presented a signed statement that Saleski signed it."}
