Radley's first post went up today, and in addition to introducing its author to his new audience it listed \"some widespread and potentially harmful misconceptions about the criminal justice system\":\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2022 Another striking misperception: The crime rate in America has been dropping dramatically since the mid-1990s. The murder rates in our largest cities are at lows we haven't seen in a half century or more. Yet Americans consistently believe crime is getting worse, not better. Last October, 64 percent of respondents told Gallup that crime was getting worse in America. Only 19 percent correctly said that it's getting better.\n\n\n\n\u2022 Likewise, the job of police officer is getting safer. Last year saw the fewest gun-related homicides of police officers since the 19th century. Assaults on cops are dropping, too. Yet we're regularly told that policing is one of the most dangerous jobs in the country. In fact, you're more likely to be murdered just by living in about half of America's largest cities than you are while working as a police officer.\n\n\n\n\u2022 Everything you know about forensics is probably wrong. Those magical machines that churn out precise and detailed information based on a half-footprint, a fiber, or a clod of dirt so that Ted Danson or David Caruso can then go on to solve the crime? They're mostly fictional. Prosecutors call this \"the CSI effect,\" and they complain that these shows condition jurors to expect far too much from forensic analysis. On the other hand, an unscrupulous prosecutor and forensic analyst can also exploit those expectations. DNA analysis\u2014which was developed within the scientific community\u2014has shown us that forensic analysis\u2014which was developed largely in the law enforcement community, and is often practiced without scientific standards like peer review and blind testing\u2014is deeply flawed.\n\nYou can read the rest here. Congratulations to Radley, and\u2014maybe more to the point\u2014congratulations to the Post and its readers.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "Radley Balko makes his debut at The Washington Post.", "title": "Four Myths About Criminal Justice", "url": "http://reason.com/blog/2014/01/08/four-myths-about-criminal-justice", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/mc/jwalker/2014_01/balko.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "As Nick Gillespie \nmentioned last month, The Washington Post has hired\nformer\nReasoner Radley Balko to write about criminal justice\nand civil liberties.
