Clinton: ACA too important to go back\n\nHillary Clinton showed more signs of flexibility Wednesday on how Obamacare is implemented, but she insisted the law is too important to \u201cturn the clock back.\u201d\n\nIn a question-and-answer session following a lecture at UCLA, Clinton suggested she\u2019s open to different ways of achieving the health law\u2019s goals. She praised Arkansas \u2014 the state where she and her husband rose to political fame \u2014 for carrying out a new approach to expanding Medicaid coverage, by using the federal money to buy private health insurance for more than 100,000 low-income residents.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nClinton called the move, spearheaded by Democratic Gov. Mike Beebe and a Republican-led Legislature, a \u201cbrilliant approach\u201d that allowed the state to increase health coverage despite GOP concerns about adding more people to the traditional Medicaid program. The Arkansas House approved the plan\u2019s renewal Tuesday.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: Obamacare's subtle sales push)\n\nBut the main goal, Clinton said, should be to keep moving ahead with the law. And in a subtle swipe at the Obama administration, she suggested that the law\u2019s supporters haven\u2019t done the best job explaining what Americans stand to gain from it.\n\n\u201cWe have to get through this election, and we have to do a better job than has been done, quite frankly, in explaining the benefits,\u201d Clinton said\n\nAmong those that already are making a difference, Clinton cited the provisions that let young adults stay on their parents\u2019 plans, give most Americans with private coverage access to preventive care and encourage research into what medical treatments are more effective than others.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: Obama's under-the-radar sales push)\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s important for people to realize what\u2019s been accomplished. There\u2019s been an enormous amount of, frankly, misinformation and disinformation,\u201d Clinton said.\n\nShe also used a line of defense that other Democrats have encouraged: Obamacare will help end \u201cjob lock,\u201d in which people hang on to a job they don\u2019t like because they\u2019re afraid their health problems will prevent them from getting insurance again if they move.\n\n\u201cI have said many times that if we were starting from scratch, we wouldn\u2019t have built an employer-based system,\u201d Clinton said. But since that\u2019s the system we have, she said, it\u2019s important to make it work.\n\n( POLITICO's full Obamacare coverage)\n\n\u201cThe Affordable Care Act will liberate people,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cYou will not have to keep a job that you don\u2019t want because of a pre-existing condition. \u2026 You will now have more opportunities to take care of yourself and your family.\u201d\n\nClinton has already suggested she\u2019s open to changes in the law, particularly for small-business owners who are worried about the impact of the law and for people whose work hours are being reduced so their employers don\u2019t have to offer them health coverage.\n\nBut on Wednesday, she put most of her emphasis on defending the law, saying the attacks are coming from ideological opponents as well as people who believe that \u201cif President Obama did it, it has to be undone.\u201d\n\n( WATCH: Ted Cruz: No shelf life for Obamacare slams)\n\n\u201cThere are some people who really want to go back to the era when we had no public support for health care. They didn\u2019t support Medicare, they didn\u2019t support Medicaid, and now they don\u2019t support the Affordable Care Act,\u201d Clinton said.\n\nIn addition, Clinton said, the law is \u201cthreatening to certain vested interests.\u201d Insurers are more willing to move forward now that they\u2019re benefiting from the new customers, but other parts of the health care industry \u2014 which she didn\u2019t name \u2014 want to \u201cturn it back for their own pecuniary interests,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cWe need to keep working on this,\u201d Clinton said.\n\nAuthors:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "She says the main goal should be to keep moving ahead with the health care law.", "title": "Clinton: ACA too important to go back", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2014/03/hillary-clinton-obamacare-too-important-104314.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2014/02/12/140212_hillary_clinton_ap_605.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Obamacare,Health Care,Hillary Clinton", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "She says the main goal should be to keep moving ahead with the health care law.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd31d2\"", "article_summary": "Clinton: ACA too important to go backHillary Clinton showed more signs of flexibility Wednesday on how Obamacare is implemented, but she insisted the law is too important to \u201cturn the clock back.\u201dIn a question-and-answer session following a lecture at UCLA, Clinton suggested she\u2019s open to different ways of achieving the health law\u2019s goals.\nThey didn\u2019t support Medicare, they didn\u2019t support Medicaid, and now they don\u2019t support the Affordable Care Act,\u201d Clinton said.\n( Also on POLITICO: Obamacare's subtle sales push)But the main goal, Clinton said, should be to keep moving ahead with the law.\n\u201cI have said many times that if we were starting from scratch, we wouldn\u2019t have built an employer-based system,\u201d Clinton said.\nClinton suggests she\u2019s open to different ways of achieving the health law\u2019s goals."}
