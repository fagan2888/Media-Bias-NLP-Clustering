We at TIME never eat or sleep, but we can help you with that last one.\n\nIf the news is good for anything, it\u2019s for changing the subject. Cousin Tara telling you all the reasons she went vegan? We\u2019ve got your back. Uncle Ronald asking you when you\u2019ll get a \u201creal job?\u201d You\u2019ll be armed and ready. Your sister saying she\u2019ll \u201cstart dating boys who have good personalities instead of good looks, just like you?\u201d Actually, not much we can do there.\n\nHere are six things to say that can get you out of awkward situations and make you sound smarter than your brother with the law degree.\n\n1. I kind of thought our politicians were on drugs. Now, we know they are.\n\nPlease accept my condolences for missing this gem of a story. Rob Ford, mayor of the great city of Toronto, was caught smoking crack earlier this year when a video surfaced showing the illegal drug use in action. At first Ford denied the crack-smoking, but he later admitted he had smoked crack that one time but was not going to resign. The man cannot stop making scandals.\n\nFord\u2019s not the only public servant who hasn\u2019t been keeping his nose clean. Freshman Republican Congressman Trey Radel recently got busted for buying cocaine from an undercover cop in Washington, D.C., and is taking a leave of absence from the House to seek treatment.\n\nRead: Don\u2019t Count Rob Ford Out\n\n2. Obama\u2019s legacy is now in the hands of the I.T. department.\n\nIf you\u2019ve slept through the near-constant health care coverage over the last year, you\u2019re not alone. The world\u2019s two biggest headaches, health insurance and computer issues, weren\u2019t careful during their one-night stand and accidentally produced an even bigger headache called the Obamacare website. But here\u2019s what you need to know: Earlier this year, Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas staged a filibuster to defund Obamacare, but the funding went through anyway. Since the Obamacare enrollment website launched on October 1st, everyone\u2019s just been getting the spinning wheel of death when they try to sign up for health care coverage. Obama\u2019s administration was on the defensive anyway because they built such a dodgy website. Things got even worse when some Americans learned they might lose their current coverage, even though Obama repeatedly said \u201cIf you like your health care plan, you can keep your health care plan.\u201d\n\nRead This: Launches and Legacies\n\n3. Well, maybe, Obama doesn\u2019t need the I.T. department after all.\n\nNow we\u2019re bringing out the big guns, Smartypants. Last week, the G5+1 (China, France, Russia, Britain, the United States, plus Germany) reached a deal with Iran that means they will halt and roll back their nuclear program in exchanged for loosened economic sanctions. It\u2019s only temporary\u2013 the deal is intended to buy time to come up with a more permanent solution\u2013but it could represent real progress in negotiating with Iran to prevent their developing nuclear weapons. Iran stands to gain over $5 billion in revenue from released oil and trade sanctions, and the rest of the world is one step closer to sleeping easy at night.\n\nRead This: The Stars are Aligned on Iran\n\n4. Nothing gets past the Internet.\n\nEarlier this year, one of the greatest love stories in sports was revealed to be a total hoax. Manti Te\u2019o, a linebacker at Notre Dame, was totally in love with his girlfriend Lennay Kekua, who was both a cancer patient and a car accident survivor. The day after she died, Te\u2019o led his team to victory because that\u2019s what she would have wanted. So we thought. It turns out Lennay Kekua didn\u2019t die a tragic death, because Lennay Kekua didn\u2019t exist. The whole thing was an elaborate hoax, as TIME\u2019s Jack Dickey helped uncover during his salad days at sports blog Deadspin.\n\nRead This: Manti Te\u2019o\u2019s Dead Girlfriend, the Most Heartbreaking and Inspirational Story of the College Football Season, Is A Hoax\n\n5. Hollywood is finally paying attention to television. Here\u2019s how I\u2019ll spoil it for you.\n\nThe best show on TV ended this year, and if you didn\u2019t watch it, you missed out. It ended like this: Walter White, the megalomaniac chemistry teacher turned meth dealer played by Bryan Cranston, returned from exile to avenge the death of his brother-in-law, DEA Agent Hank, and to get revenge for all the money a White Power gang stole from him. He sets up a ruse to make sure his family is provided for, then kills the gang and himself with a jerry-rigged machine gun. His sidekick, the unlucky Jesse Pinkman, is the only one who escapes the bloodbath. The show is important not just because it was the biggest entertainment story of the year, but because it shepherded in a new, TV-centric Hollywood. Sony Pictures, one of Hollywood\u2019s biggest studios, recently announced they would be focusing more on TV development than moviemaking.\n\nRead This: Is There Too Much Great TV or Too Little?\n\n6. Commoners rule.\n\nWill and Kate welcomed a healthy baby boy this year, and if you don\u2019t want to dig into any of the thornier topics listed here, this one\u2019s a fairly innocuous bet. The baby is adorable! Kate wore blue! He\u2019s named George and one day he\u2019ll be king! You could crow about it with your female relatives (how did Kate lose all that baby weight?) or, if you want to get provocative, you make it into a conversation about feminism. What is a woman\u2019s role in the 21st century, anyway? Or, even better, you can get into a discussion about the role of the monarchy in modern British life (goody!) George, thanks to mum Kate, is the first person in line for Britain\u2019s throne with common blood, a source of inspiration for us all.\n\nRead This: The Half-Blood Prince", "article_metadata": {"description": "The holidays are for three things: eating, sleeping, and one-upping your relatives.
