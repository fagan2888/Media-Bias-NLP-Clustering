It also found possible evidence of sophisticated \u201ccounter-forensics activity performed by the attacker to cover his/her tracks.\u201d\n\nThe report says that no private consumer information was stored on the hacked server, and that CGI Group had \u201cverified that no additional servers [that may store private data] communicated with any of the identified attacker IP addresses.\u201d\n\nBut Michael Gregg, the CEO of the cyber-security consulting firm Superior Solutions, says it\u2019s possible the hacker went on to access other parts of Vermont Health Connect, covering his tracks and remaining undetected to this day.\n\n\u201cThere is potential for consumer risk,\u201d says Gregg, who has also testified to Congress about cyber-security risks for HealthCare.gov. \u201cBest practices were not carried out in several respects. All those point to the possibility of further or additional breaches, because they have just not shown that they have done the due diligence, and without those controls in place, it\u2019s hard to say. The attacker could have captured passwords on additional systems and used those to create different accounts that Vermont Health Connect doesn\u2019t know about yet.\u201d\n\nThe hacker gained access because the default password to the development server was never changed (in violation of guidelines laid out in the state\u2019s official policy) and because access to the server was not restricted only to users who were known and approved.\n\nLawrence Miller, chief of health-care reform for the state of Vermont, tells National Review Online that the development deadlines might have been a factor in the security problems, as it had been on other state exchanges and the federal exchange.\n\n\u201cThis is a highly compressed time frame, and you saw corners getting cut \u2014 I don\u2019t know if \u2018corners getting cut\u2019 is the right way to put it \u2014 but you saw all of those teams working on an expedited basis,\u201d he says. Other parts of the health exchange were stored on much more secure servers, he adds, and in his view consumers\u2019 personal information was not compromised.\n\nThe hacked development server \u201cfrankly should never have been plugged into the wall as far as I could tell,\u201d he says. \u201cIf [this breach] had been any measure of our [overall] security system, that would be very problematic, but it\u2019s more like someone walking into an unlocked, new house, and the default password for the alarm system is on a Post-It note next to the alarm pad, and the front door was unlocked. . . . [The hacked server] wasn\u2019t behind the firewalls that were protecting the rest of our system. That\u2019s what I\u2019ve been given to understand. So it just wasn\u2019t at all subject to the same security.\u201d\n\nE-mails about the attack show Vermont Health Connect employees discussing their concerns about CGI Group. In one January 24 e-mail, Michael Morey, the chief technology officer for the State of Vermont, wrote: \u201cIf for some reason CGI staff opened up development to the internet to speed integration or whatever and did not bring that to the [State of Vermont], \u2018I would not be surprised\u2019 but more disappointed again. I could say so much more but everyone on this email is smart.\u201d\n\nIn another e-mail, Nick Waringa, the chief information-security officer for Vermont\u2019s Department of Information and Innovation, wrote, \u201cThe lack of available CGI security resource on Fridays and Mondays is troubling.\u201d\n\nLarry Seltzer, an independent security analyst and contributing editor at the information-technology publication ZDNet, says that CGI Group\u2019s role in the breach is hardly surprising, given its involvement with the glitch-plagued HealthCare.gov, as well as with some of the state exchanges that ran into tech problems.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t buy bad publicity like this,\u201d Seltzer says. \u201cIt looks to me like whoever was administering the development servers didn\u2019t take security for them very seriously. It\u2019s not good, but it could have been a lot worse. I\u2019d call [this incident] moderately embarrassing.\u201d\n\nCGI Group declined NRO\u2019s request for an interview, referring us back to Miller, the Vermont chief of health-care reform. Miller would not comment when asked whether CGI Group\u2019s contract was subject to review, but he said that the state has engaged in renegotiations with the company to address areas of concern.\n\nAccording to the records that NRO reviewed, \u201csuspicious . . . commands\u201d dated back to December 18, 2013, and the Romanian IP first logged on to the Vermont Health Exchange server on December 23. But the attack was not detected until January 23.\n\n\u201cThis is very troubling and indicates that sufficient monitoring was not being performed,\u201d says Gregg, the cyber-security expert. \u201cThe report states that support does not seem to be available 24/7. . . . It only takes a short period of time to cause massive damage and raises the potential for large amounts of [consumers\u2019 personally identifying information] to have been exposed.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, the RIPE database, a European Internet registry, has already associated the Romanian IP addresses involved in the hacking of Vermont Health Connect with other attacks, spam, and malware. Had Vermont Health Connect been following best practices, Gregg points out, it would have already blocked such potentially threatening addresses, as well as those originating in Eastern Europe, Russia, and China.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first security breach at the Vermont health exchange.\n\nLast November, the Associated Press reported on an incident in which an enrollee received his own application in the mail, courtesy of an anonymous sender who had scrawled \u201cVERMONT HEALTH CONNECT IS NOT A SECURE WEBSITE!\u201d on both the envelope and the application. The unnamed sender had obtained paperwork that included the applicant\u2019s Social Security number as well as other private information.\n\nMiller, the health-care reform chief, insists that Vermont residents should feel confident the health exchange has security measures in place to protect their private information.\n\n\u201cAny time you are operating a system that has people\u2019s information on it, there\u2019s a risk, and we look around the world at fairly sophisticated organizations that have had data breaches,\u201d Miller says, citing breaches at Target, banks, and elsewhere. \u201cIt would be foolish for anybody in our position to be comfortable at any time that we were fully secure, so our antenna, our concern, is at a very high level in this area. . . . You can never say there\u2019s a zero chance, and you have to be concerned every single day, but I do think the appropriate measures are in place to assure Vermonters that their data [are] safe at the level of high current standards.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Jillian Kay Melchior is a Thomas L.

The unnamed sender had obtained paperwork that included the applicant\u2019s Social Security number as well as other private information.\n\nMiller, the health-care reform chief, insists that Vermont residents should feel confident the health exchange has security measures in place to protect their private information.\n\n\u201cAny time you are operating a system that has people\u2019s information on it, there\u2019s a risk, and we look around the world at fairly sophisticated organizations that have had data breaches,\u201d Miller says, citing breaches at Target, banks, and elsewhere. \u201cIt would be foolish for anybody in our position to be comfortable at any time that we were fully secure, so our antenna, our concern, is at a very high level in this area.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0You can never say there\u2019s a zero chance, and you have to be concerned every single day, but I do think the appropriate measures are in place to assure Vermonters that their data [are] safe at the level of high current standards.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Jillian Kay Melchior is a Thomas L.
