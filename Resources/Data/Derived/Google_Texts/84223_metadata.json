But Cantor\u2019s rise was almost as improbably swift.\n\nElected in 2000 to represent Virginia\u2019s 7th Congressional District, he was appointed chief deputy whip after only one term. When Republicans regained control of the House in 2010 and Rep. John Boehner was elected to speaker, Cantor took the reins as majority leader, a heartbeat away from becoming the chamber\u2019s top Republican.\n\nIs there another Eric Cantor waiting in the wings? Another Jewish Republican who, through energy, fundraising abilities, and disciplined public adherence to the GOP\u2019s message has the potential to repeat the Cantor magic?\n\nThree up-and-coming Jewish Republicans look like they have what it takes: New York State Sen. Lee Zeldin, Los Angeles prosecutor Elan Carr, and Arizona State Rep. Adam Kwasman.\n\nLee Zeldin\n\nIn New York, state Sen. Lee Zeldin is competing for the 1st Congressional District seat held by Democratic incumbent U.S. Rep. Tim Bishop, an Army Reserve major who served active duty in the U.S. Army Airborne and is an attorney. Zeldin\u2019s first attempt at the seat in 2008 as a political neophyte ended in a loss. Since then, he won a seat in the state Senate and has been popular with constituents and local Republican Party organizations.\n\nZeldin is seen as having the best chance out of all Jewish Republicans running for Congress this year. Bishop nearly lost his previous re-election bids to another Republican Jew, Randy Altschuler.\n\nSince then, Bishop has been mired in investigations from the Congressional Ethics Office and the FBI into accusations that he solicited a campaign contribution from a hedge fund investor in exchange for using his office to obtain fireworks permits for the bar mitzvah of the investor\u2019s son.\n\n\u201cI think we need to improve the branding of the Republican Party,\u201d Zeldin told JNS.org. \u201cThere are many voters who think that compassion and caring means liberalism, and that\u2019s an important challenge for Republicans to overcome. I happen to believe that conservatives are showing the most amount of compassion when looking out for future generations of Americans who aren\u2019t even old enough to vote yet.\u201d\n\nZeldin\u2019s popularity and record in the district makes him a formidable opponent to Bishop in the general election, but first he must first contest the party nomination against perennial candidate and former U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission prosecutor George Demos. Demos has run for the seat twice before, losing in the primaries. He married the daughter of a wealthy California developer between the current and previous elections and has been able to loan $2 million to his own campaign, compared to Zeldin raising $735,000 and Bishop amassing $1.5 million, according to the most recent Federal Election Commission filings.\n\nWith the June 24 primaries around the corner, both GOP candidates have been competing for the title of the \u201creal conservative,\u201d with Demos accusing Zeldin of voting to increase taxes and supporting the Affordable Care Act as a state senator and Zeldin accusing Demos of funding his campaign with his father-in-law\u2019s money, which has also filled the coffers of leading California Democrats like Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.).\n\n\u201cDemos is rather loathed by most local Republican leaders because he\u2019s always trying to muscle their candidates aside. But this is the first time he\u2019s really had money and the reason is his wife,\u201d said Cook Political Report house editor and political analyst David Wasserman. \u201cHe\u2019s run for Congress twice before and done woefully. In between last time he ran, he got married to the daughter of a construction mogul in California and now all of a sudden he has $2 million to spend on the race \u2014 so you can connect the dots.\u201d\n\nZeldin has received high-level endorsements from Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), former Sens. Rick Santorum (R-Pa.) and Alfonse D\u2019Amato (R-N.Y.), Donald Trump, and every local Republican Party organization. Cantor headlined a fundraiser for Zeldin on June 14 in the Hamptons, raising more than $100,000, according to reports.\n\nIn Wasserman\u2019s assessment, Zeldin would give Bishop a \u201crun for his money\u201d if he were to win the primary, even though the Cook Political Report currently places the advantage on the Democrat side.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "JNS.org", "description": "With House Majority Leader Eric Cantor\u2019s stunning loss last week, the \r\nhighest-ranking Jewish Republican politician has suddenly been booted from \r\npower.
