GOP confident of Senate takeover\n\nAt an annual gathering of Republican bigwigs in Florida a year ago, a top GOP strategist was chided after he gave a presentation about how his party would win the Senate in 2014, including a handout that blared \u201cMAJORITY\u201d in red.\n\n\u201cStop saying majority,\u201d donors, consultants and even some senators told National Republican Senatorial Committee Executive Director Rob Collins, he recalled in an interview. \u201cJust say you\u2019re going to be able to pick up a few seats.\u201d\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nFast forward to early this month, when the annual event took place again at the same posh Palm Beach resort. Far from preaching caution, many of the 400 donors in attendance openly mused about what a Republican Senate would bring, and Collins was the one trying to keep expectations in check.\n\n( PHOTOS: Senators up for election in 2014)\n\nAfter 15 months in the doldrums, Republicans feel like they\u2019re finally getting their mojo back.\n\nEmboldened by the president\u2019s weak poll numbers, the botched Obamacare rollout and a still-sputtering economy, GOP donors and operatives are increasingly bullish about their prospects in the midterm election \u2014 most of all capturing the Senate. Seats that a year ago looked like sure bets for Democrats now have the makings of real races \u2014 in states such as Michigan, Virginia, and, if former Republican Sen. Scott Brown runs, New Hampshire.\n\nWorries last fall that the party would pay a heavy price at the ballot box for forcing the government to shut down have faded as quickly as attention has shifted to frustration with the health care law.\n\nNo one is saying that the party has solved its underlying problems \u2014 deep distrust between the establishment and tea party wings, and the disconnect with young and minority voters that was on display in 2012. And Republicans were similarly optimistic in 2010 and 2012 about retaking the Senate until poor candidates blew winnable races.\n\n( PHOTOS: Governors\u2019 offices up for grabs in 2014)\n\nBut there\u2019s a palpable sense of optimism that 2014 will be the GOP\u2019s year.\n\n\u201cPeople like to hang out with winners, and it feels right now as though Republicans \u2014 unlike the early part of last year \u2014 have found their sea legs and have a bit of wind at their back,\u201d said New York investment banker and major GOP donor Jeffrey Berenson.\n\nAfter getting outraised by $16 million last year, the NRSC announced recently that it collected just slightly more money than its Democratic counterpart in December. Leaders of the major conservative outside groups say that skittish donors have started to open their checkbooks with the new year after a lackluster fundraising haul in 2013.\n\nAnd in a huge boon for the Republican effort, Americans for Prosperity, the group funded by the billionaire Koch brothers, has spent tens of millions of dollars already targeting vulnerable Democratic incumbents on Obamacare. That\u2019s an unusually high level of engagement so long before Election Day.\n\n( PHOTOS: Republican 2016 contenders)\n\nEven with the improved environment this year, the party\u2019s chances are still roughly 50-50, according to several election handicappers. And there is concern that contentious primaries \u2014 in states such as Georgia, Iowa, Alaska and North Carolina \u2014 will again yield nominees who can\u2019t win a general election.\n\n\u201cWhile the mood has changed, we still have significant work to bring that about,\u201d said NRSC Chairman Jerry Moran, a senator from Kansas.\n\n\u201cWe could still blow it and end up hurting ourselves in some way,\u201d added Collins. \u201cBut after last year \u2014 a rough fundraising environment, the shutdown and disagreements on the right \u2014 now people from all sides are starting to come around. \u2026 We\u2019ve just got to go out and earn it.\u201d\n\nDemocrats say Republican candidates haven\u2019t put up the kind of eye-popping fundraising numbers that back up the rhetoric about a party on the march. They also caution that the election landscape is too unsettled to forecast big GOP gains; it remains to be seen whether Republican candidates in key battlegrounds such as Arkansas, Louisiana and North Carolina have what it takes to unseat incumbents.\n\n( PHOTOS: Who's leaving Congress?)\n\n\u201cThis is exactly what they said two years ago, and once again Republican mentality and reality are two very different things,\u201d said Matt Canter, deputy executive director of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. \u201cThe additional problem for Republicans this time is that voters understand that a Senate bought and paid for by the Koch brothers is not one that is good for their family.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s hard to overstate how burned major GOP donors felt after Mitt Romney\u2019s defeat and the party\u2019s loss of Senate seats in 2012.\n\nThe poor morale continued through last year, hitting bottom during the two-week government shutdown in October. Donors were aghast at how party leaders acquiesced to the tea party wing of the GOP led by Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas).\n\nOnce the shutdown ended and attention shifted to Obamacare, though, the mood brightened. But it wasn\u2019t just the health care law that lifted the party\u2019s spirits.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "Republican donors and operatives are more bullish about their prospects of taking over the Senate.", "title": "GOP confident of Senate takeover", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2014/02/2014-senate-republican-takeover-103297.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2014/02/09/senate_republicans_ap_605.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Elections,Senate,Republicans,2014 Elections", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "Republican donors and operatives are more bullish about their prospects of taking over the Senate.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2e74\"", "article_summary": "GOP confident of Senate takeoverAt an annual gathering of Republican bigwigs in Florida a year ago, a top GOP strategist was chided after he gave a presentation about how his party would win the Senate in 2014, including a handout that blared \u201cMAJORITY\u201d in red.\nDonors were aghast at how party leaders acquiesced to the tea party wing of the GOP led by Sen.
