More than 800 high school performers are in La Crosse

this weekend to sing their hearts out.

La Crosse Central High School is hosting its first

Show Choir Invitational competition.

the La Crosse Central Grand River Invitational.

Students from Nebraska.

Minnesota.

and Wisconsin are taking part in the event.

Students say the competition is a good way to connect

with other performers.

You really make a lot of friends with show choir.

You meet somebody, see them in the hall way, say good

job, and then you really get to know them.

Now, with social media you put your name on a board

and people start following you and you start talking,

you make friends from other cities and it's really

group-gathering.

International performing artist Natalie Weiss offered

workshops for the students earlier today as well.
