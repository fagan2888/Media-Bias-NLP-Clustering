When I walked into the office from lunch Tuesday, a caller rang me up at my desk. She had read Clarice\u2019s article about the possibility of a strike at Kroger and was mad. Furious in fact. Her basic argument was that if people wanted to get paid more, they should quit and find a job that offers more money. That\u2019s easier said than done.\n\nIt\u2019s a situation I keep running into. When there\u2019s talk of a strike or protest about working conditions, the argument comes out that they should be thankful for the job and just be quiet. It\u2019s hard to be quiet, however, when your job doesn\u2019t pay enough to cover your bills. Even so, that\u2019s not the complaint these Kroger employees are using. For the most part, they understand the job they were hired for. But, they argue if the company improves, then they should get an equal benefit of that success with management. After all, they\u2019re the ones on the ground floor, making things work. That\u2019s not to say people on all levels of a company don\u2019t contribute, but each needs to be treated fairly. These workers are not ungrateful for a 25 cent raise. They just have questions. Why should they get 25 cents on the hourly rate, when the CEO pulled in a 17 percent raise, up from $9.6 million to $11.2 million? Did he do that much more to contribute to success? Why is it that his bonus increased each of the last three years and yet Kroger workers don\u2019t even get one paid personal day, to take when they get sick? If the argument is, as I\u2019ve heard before, \u2018well he just did a good job negotiating,\u2019 then why do we get upset when workers band together and do the same thing?", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Progress", "description": "\u201cNo one made you go to college and companies shouldn't suffer because of it.\u201d That may be the oddest conversation I\u2019ve ever had.
