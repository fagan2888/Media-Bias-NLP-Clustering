This as police continue to search for the teen girls considered endangered.\n\nLate Wednesday night, law enforcement say Ke'Aira Baker, Jasmine Bell, Adriana Doolin, Stephanie Grounds and Sidney Rhoten-Young ran away from Youthville's Secure Care facility in Newton.\n\n\"We're very concerned about the girls. Certainly we never want that kind of thing to happen,\" said Shelley Duncan, the president and CEO of Ember Hope, a private child welfare organization that oversees Youthville.\n\nShe says at this particular group home, staff provide 24/7 care for 10 to 18-year-old girls in the foster care system who have chronic runaway behaviors.\n\n\"It is a locked facility,\" Duncan said. \"So we have high fences and all of the doors are locked. And so the staff were not being negligent. There was absolutely no lack of oversight on their part. We typically exceed all of the staffing ratios at all of our facilities. So we were absolutely in compliance with that.\"\n\nInstead, Duncan says the teens methodically planned their escape, accessing key fobs through \"physical means\" from the staff who typically carry them.\n\n\"We do have cameras that are recording at all times. So we always go back and review what happened,\" Duncan said. \"We'll go back and try to assess what we could have done differently so that we can be prepared in the event this should happen again.\"\n\nWhile Youthville has been around since the 1920s, this particular program for at-risk girls began three years ago. Duncan says this is the third time girls have runaway from the Secure Care facility.\n\n________________________________________________\n\nThe Newton Police Department is searching for five girls who left a youth care facility overnight.\n\nPolice say the circumstances of their disappearance cannot be publicly discussed, but has led the department to classify them as endangered runaways.\n\nThe missing girls are:\n\nKe'Aira Baker, 16\n\nJasmine Bell, 16\n\nAdriana Doolin, 14\n\nStephanie Grounds, 16\n\nSidney Rhoten-Young, 17\n\nThe Wichita/Sedgwick County Exploited and Missing Child Unit is assisting in the search and investigation.\n\nAnyone with information is asked to call police.
