Terre Haute South's Timmy Herrin took to Twitter to announce his decision to pursue baseball at Indiana University. He chose the Hoosiers over other division one programs such as ISU and Cincinnati.



The lefty had a stellar summer playing for the Indiana Prospects. Those performances led many big time schools to get involved in his recruitment. But ultimately Herrin believes IU is the best fit.



I spoke with Braves head football coach and Timmy's dad Tim. He said Timmy is relieved to have made his decision and is excited for the opportunity.



As of now Timmy will not pursue football at IU. He plans to focus on baseball, and rightfully so. The IU coaching staff believes Timmy has huge upside. As of this summer Timmy's fastball was clocked around the mid 80's. And as a lefty that could be pretty dangerous. And he obviously has this season to improve that mark. Timmy joins a recent list of Terre Haute baseball players to play at major division one programs. And both of those guys are now making a lot of money playing professionally. Now with the decision behind him Timmy can focus on the rest of the football season as the braves are 2 and oh on the year.
