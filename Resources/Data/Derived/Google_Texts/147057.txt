A man fleeing from Pueblo police after a bank robbery jumped into the Arkansas River — with the money he had allegedly stolen — then taunted officers from the water before disappearing into the undertow never to resurface.

The man, who has not been identified, walked into the Security Service Federal Credit Union on the 300 block of Abriendo Avenue Thursday afternoon and demanded money, police said in a news release.

When officers arrived, witnesses began pointing towards a trail leading to the river. Police saw a man matching a description of the suspect and began chasing him until he jumped into the river.

“The suspect then swam to a concrete pillar in the middle of the river where he began taunting officers before taking off his shoes and jumping into (a) spillway,” the release said.

The man surfaced briefly before disappearing into the water.

Police and fire officials are searching the river for the man, police said. The river has been running high because of heavy recent rains and snowmelt.
