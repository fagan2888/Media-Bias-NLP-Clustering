And competitors took advantage of the opportunity to best the best, stepping up with strong runs in what became a day of upsets in the halfpipe.\n\nBouncing back from a 2012 injury, Mammoth Mountain\u2019s Greg Bretz \u2014 a 2010 member of the U.S. Olympic halfpipe squad \u2014 threw down a dominant first run that held throughout the best-of-two-runs contest Saturday morning.\n\n\u201cBeing able to win this one was a huge sigh of relief,\u201d said Bretz, whose top finish puts him in the lead for a berth on the U.S. Snowboarding halfpipe squad in Sochi. \u201cI can go into the next four contests extremely confident and ready to ride.\u201d\n\nWhite, who will compete in Sunday\u2019s Dew Tour snowboard slopestyle contest as he vies to make both the U.S.\u2019s pipe and slopestyle teams in Sochi, did not look happy with his silver medal.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s always a poor loser,\u201d Bretz said. \u201cBut to me, he didn\u2019t lose. He won second.\u201d\n\nSteamboat Springs\u2019 Taylor Gold delivered confident grabs and the contest\u2019s only double-cork Michalchuk \u2013 a double-backflip trick named after snowboarding pioneer Michael Michalchuk \u2013 to earn bronze and put the 20-year-old on a fast-track to Sochi.\n\nAustralian Torah Bright, the 2010 Winter Olympic gold medalist, took the women\u2019s gold with technical back-to-back alley oops. Clark, who came to Breckenridge on an unrivaled 16-of-17 winning streak, boosted her signature 1080 on her first run but was unable to best Bright\u2019s 95.4 score.\n\nThirteen-year-old Chloe Kim \u2013 a member of the U.S. Rookie Halfpipe Team \u2013 set a remarkable tone for her first year on the pro circuit taking bronze with three 720 spins. Although she\u2019s too young to compete in Sochi, Kim is pacing to make an impact on women\u2019s snowboarding.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Dew Tour,Dew Tour Snowboard Halfpipe,Greg Bretz,Halfpipe,Kelly Clark,Mammoth Mountain,Shaun White,Snowboarding,Steamboat Springs,Torah Bright", "language": "en, sv", "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "og": {"site_name": "All Things Colorado Sports", "description": "Shaun White and Kelly Clark stumbled and earned silver medals at the Dew Tour snowboard halfpipe, while Greg Bretz and Torah Bright took gold.", "title": "Greg Bretz bests Shaun White, Torah Bright beats Kelly Clark in Dew Tour snowboard halfpipe", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/sports/2013/12/14/dew-tour-upsets-greg-bretz-best-shaun-white-and-torah-bright-beats-kelly-clark-in-snowboard-halfpipe/26003/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/sports/files/2013/12/kelly-clark-torah-bright.jpg", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "Shaun White and Kelly Clark stumbled and earned silver medals at the Dew Tour snowboard halfpipe, while Greg Bretz and Torah Bright took gold.", "title": "Greg Bretz bests Shaun White, Torah Bright beats Kelly Clark in Dew Tour snowboard halfpipe", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/sports/2013/12/14/dew-tour-upsets-greg-bretz-best-shaun-white-and-torah-bright-beats-kelly-clark-in-snowboard-halfpipe/26003/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/sports/files/2013/12/kelly-clark-torah-bright.jpg", "creator": "@jasonblevins", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "Shaun White and Kelly Clark stumbled and earned silver medals at the Dew Tour snowboard halfpipe, while Greg Bretz and Torah Bright took gold."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdee89\"", "article_summary": "Both Shaun White and Kelly Clark took rare tumbles in the halfpipe Saturday during the Dew Tour finals at Breckenridge.\nAustralian Torah Bright, the 2010 Winter Olympic gold medalist, took the women\u2019s gold with technical back-to-back alley oops.\nAlthough she\u2019s too young to compete in Sochi, Kim is pacing to make an impact on women\u2019s snowboarding.\nBouncing back from a 2012 injury, Mammoth Mountain\u2019s Greg Bretz \u2014 a 2010 member of the U.S. Olympic halfpipe squad \u2014 threw down a dominant first run that held throughout the best-of-two-runs contest Saturday morning.\n\u201cBeing able to win this one was a huge sigh of relief,\u201d said Bretz, whose top finish puts him in the lead for a berth on the U.S. Snowboarding halfpipe squad in Sochi."}
