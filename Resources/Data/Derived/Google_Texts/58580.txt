Jim Cramer warned investors to stay cautious when accounting irregularities are mentioned, especially for this stock.

Jim Cramer always abides by one simple rule. When there are account irregularities, you do not ask questions, you do not make excuses, you do not wait for clarity â€” you just sell.

"Accounting irregularities equals sell. That has been one of my cardinal rules for decades now, and if you want to know why, you only need to look at Valeant," the "Mad Money" host said.

A dark cloud has hung over Valeant ever since speculation began that it may use unorthodox methods to sell drugs. Cramer traced the initial charge of accounting irregularities to Andrew Left, of Citron Research.

Cramer has often been criticized for his rule, especially those that kept investors out of companies that were legitimate but tarred unfairly with accounting charges.

"It is true. I have been too cautious at times and have missed opportunities," Cramer said.

However, the pain in Valeant should be a constant reminder of how right his rule is. This stock has been a nightmare that simply could have been avoided by following one straightforward principle.
