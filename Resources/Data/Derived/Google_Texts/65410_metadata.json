The receiver\u2019s decision ends a temporary court-ordered suspension at Stockton\u2019s California Health Care Facility.\n\n\u201cWe are going to slowly begin admitting medical patients.\u201d\n\nIn early 2014 the federal overseer of medical care in California prisons suspended all transfers to the $800 million prison medical complex because of unsanitary conditions. Receiver Clark Kelso found doctors and nurses at the facility lacked essential supplies, such as bandages and catheters for incontinent inmates. He also found that staff was too small to provide around-the-clock care to the hundreds of inmates at the prison with complex medical conditions.\n\nSpokeswoman Joyce Hayhoe said Monday that after a series of improvements, the Stockton prison may accept inmates again.\n\n\u201cWe are going to slowly begin admitting medical patients,\u201d Hayhoe said. \u201cWe\u2019ll be very closely monitoring our progress to make sure that the things that we\u2019ve been able to fix at the facility are sustained.\u201d\n\nThe receiver hired a new medical CEO, streamlined the supply ordering process, retrained staff, and is in the process of hiring more nurses.\n\nFor its part, the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation added hundreds of custody and support staff.\n\nSpokeswoman Terry Thornton says a $12 million boost in this year\u2019s budget will pay to add another 100 employees. \u201cThe increase in custody staff enables the medical staff to do their job and focus on providing inmate patient care.\u201d\n\nDon Spector, an attorney with the Prison Law Office, who monitors inmate medical care agreed conditions at the California Health Care Facility improved dramatically since January, but worried what would happen when the prison reaches full capacity \u2014 with double the number of inmates.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Admissions were suspended at the facility earlier this year due to unsanitary conditions.", "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"Admissions Resume at Stockton Prison Health Facility\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/2014\\/07\\/22\\/admissions-resume-at-stockton-prison-health-facility\\/\",\"pub_date\":\"2014-07-22 09:38:38\",\"mod_date\":\"2014-07-22 11:43:32\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":20289,\"author_id\":\"8344\",\"author_name\":\"State of Health\",\"author_display_name\":\"State of Health\",\"tags\":[\"Prison Health\"],\"categories\":[\"Policy\"],\"image\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/sites\\/27\\/2014\\/07\\/RS9106_CHCF_pic-LARGE-hpf.jpg\"}", "og": {"site_name": "State of Health", "description": "Admissions were suspended at the facility earlier this year due to unsanitary conditions.", "title": "Admissions Resume at Stockton Prison Health Facility", "url": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/2014/07/22/admissions-resume-at-stockton-prison-health-facility/", "image": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/wp-content/uploads/sites/27/2014/07/RS9106_CHCF_pic-LARGE-hpf.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@kqedhealth", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@"}, "fb": {"app_id": 160023622793}, "keywords": "prison health", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "By Julie SmallThe federal receiver who manages medical care in California prisons reopened admissions Monday at a Stockton facility for the state\u2019s sickest inmates.\nThe receiver\u2019s decision ends a temporary court-ordered suspension at Stockton\u2019s California Health Care Facility.\nSpokeswoman Joyce Hayhoe said Monday that after a series of improvements, the Stockton prison may accept inmates again.\n\u201cWe are going to slowly begin admitting medical patients.\u201dIn early 2014 the federal overseer of medical care in California prisons suspended all transfers to the $800 million prison medical complex because of unsanitary conditions.\nReceiver Clark Kelso found doctors and nurses at the facility lacked essential supplies, such as bandages and catheters for incontinent inmates."}
