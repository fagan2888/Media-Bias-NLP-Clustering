The man shot by Denver police while he used a hostage as a human shield after he entered a 7-Eleven with a gun last week, has died.

Blas Leroux, 34, died Friday, according to the Denver coroner.

The update was first reported by 7News.

Leroux was shot one time by police on Jan. 13 outside the store at West Colfax Avenue and Perry Street.

Leroux kept officers at bay for more than an hour before stepping out of the store with a woman in front of him.

Police said he was using the woman as a shield and he was attempting to drag her back into the store when he was shot by a Denver police officer.
