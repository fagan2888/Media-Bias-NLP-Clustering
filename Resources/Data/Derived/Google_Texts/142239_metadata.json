That isn\u2019t true.\n\nThe battle over Alabama\u2019s Sixth Congressional District hasn\u2019t received much media attention as underdog Mark Lester (D), a history professor at Birmingham Southern College, takes on Gary Palmer (R), former president of the largely unknown Alabama Policy Institute (API). But questions about the sources of funding to API and Lester\u2019s challenge to Palmer\u2014calling on him to reveal his tax returns\u2014might transform the contest over a predominantly red district into the frontlines in the ongoing debate over candidates\u2019 financial transparency and sources of campaign finance. Ad Policy\n\nOn September 9, Lester charged that Palmer is a \u201cman who has lived off of special interest contributions for several decades of his life,\u201d and that API is funded largely from sources outside of Alabama. Palmer responded, \u201cI can assure you that [API\u2019s] donor list is primarily\u2014I mean, almost entirely\u2014individuals.\u201d\n\nAn investigation into API\u2019s donors by The Nation reveals that Palmer\u2019s statement is demonstrably untrue.\n\nIn 2012, the last year in which complete tax data is available, the API received nearly half ($480,519) of its $970,977 in grant revenue from thirteen 501(c)(3) foundation donors, not individuals.\n\nThe majority of institutional grants came from out-of-state foundations ($282,969), the largest donor being the National Christian Charitable Foundation, a massive donor-advised fund based in Georgia. National Christian Charitable Foundation is one of the nation\u2019s biggest donors to the anti-gay and anti-abortion movement. (Hobby Lobby\u2019s owners and executives were NCF\u2019s biggest donors in 2009.)\n\nOther major 501(c)(3) donors in 2012 included: Virginia-based Donors Trust ($97,000); Alabama-based J.L. Bedsole Foundation ($100,000) and the Alabama-based Williams Charitable Foundation ($50,300).\n\nNone of this fits with Palmer\u2019s claim that API, under his leadership, was funded \u201calmost entirely\u201d by individuals.\n\nBut an exploration into the funding supporting Palmer\u2019s candidacy brings up even stranger links to out-of-state interests.\n\nPalmer has raised $1,086,567 in campaign contributions. Over half of that, $548,176, came from the Washington, DC\u2013based Club for Growth PAC, a conservative political action committee that \u201cendorses and raises money for candidates who stay true to the fundamental principles of limited government and economic freedom,\u201d according to its website.\n\nNone of that diverges from Palmer\u2019s stated positions of opposing tax increases, reducing regulations limiting oil drilling in the United States, and repealing Obamacare. However, an examination of Club For Growth PAC\u2019s donors reveals that only one of its biggest donors comes from Alabama.\n\nPAC contributors can give a maximum of $5,000, and Club for Growth PAC raised nearly $200,000 from heavy-hitter donors who maxed out and gave $5,000. In 2013 and 2014, only one donor from Alabama, T. Owen Vickers (an executive at Birmingham Hide & Tallow Company), was a member of the PAC\u2019s $5,000 club.\n\nPalmer\u2019s claim that the Alabama Policy Institute is funded \u201calmost entirely\u201d by individuals is false. But, perhaps more importantly, it looks like his campaign is receiving the majority of its funding from a Washington, DC\u2013based PAC funded almost entirely by non-Alabaman voters.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "http://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/al_statehouse_ap-275x173.jpg", "sailthru.author": "Eli Clifton", "description": "Gary Palmer claims his think tank's funding is \"almost entirely\" from individuals.
