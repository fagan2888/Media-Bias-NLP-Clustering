Deaths from heroin and prescription drug overdoses in Ocean County, N.J., already among the highest in the state per capita, more than doubled in 2013, and three residents have already overdosed in 2014.\n\n\u201cIt is a suburban epidemic facing us throughout New Jersey,\u201d said Angelo Valente, executive director of the Partnership for a Drug-Free New Jersey. \u201cA lot of suburban counties are affected at dangerous levels.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is no longer just an inner city issue,\u201d said Al Della Fave, spokesman for the Ocean County prosecutor\u2019s office.\n\nIn 2012, 53 people died of heroin and prescription drug overdoses in Ocean County, a boardwalked string of beach towns like Seaside Heights, home to the long-running reality series \u201cThe Jersey Shore.\u201d Ocean County had already claimed the New Jersey state title for highest number of heroin-related emergency room admissions, ahead of urban counties like Hudson and Essex with larger populations. It led the state in 2011 with 11 percent of all admissions and again in 2012 with 11.4 percent of admissions, despite having less than seven percent of the state\u2019s population.\n\nLast year, the county death toll from overdoses soared to 112, with the majority heroin-related, roughly ten percent of a state total of 1,188 overdose deaths. Three locals have already died in 2014. Over the weekend, two men died of heroin overdoses in Point Pleasant and Seaside Heights. Local police have issued a warning about a possibly tainted brand of heroin being sold under the name \u201cBud Light.\u201d\n\nDella Fave said the popularity of heroin and related drugs has risen because of purity and price and that DEA reports show use is spreading in suburban and rural areas of New Jersey and Pennsylvania. Use of a needle is no longer a deterrent, said Della Fave, \u201cbecause people are simply snorting the newer, purer product.\u201d\n\nValente blamed the problem in part on young people\u2019s access to medicine cabinets. \u201cPrescription drugs are a gateway drug to heroin,\u201d said Valente.\n\nOcean County prosecutors have even distributed warning cards to funeral homes so families understand the need to dispose of unused prescription medications, particularly those containing opiates, that may be left behind by the deceased. According to prosecutors, \u201cIt is our hope that these unused medications will be disposed of at the designated drop-off points so that they do not get into the hands of those who would use or sell them illegally.\u201d\n\nDella Fave also warned users that there\u2019s still no consistency in how the product is cut. \u201cEvery time users take it,\u201d he said, \u201cthey\u2019re rolling the dice with their lives.\n\nMore from NBC News Investigations:\n\nFollow NBC News Investigations on Twitter and Facebook", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Jersey Shore, famous for sun, fun and reality TV, now has a new and less welcome distinction.
