Normally, this drop in temperature would cause serious brain damage, but amazingly the animals wake up unharmed. Recently, researchers from the University of Leicester have found the enzyme which preserves the brain cells during hibernation, and believe this enzyme could also be used to help preserve the memory of Alzheimer\u2019s patients.\n\nThe enzyme, called RBM3, works by helping animals to rebuild the brain cells lost during hibernation, The Telegraph reported. In a recent study, researchers purposely dropped the body temperature of mice with an Alzheimer\u2019s-like disease, and a healthy group, to around 60 to 64 degrees Fahrenheit. This temperature is similar to what hibernating mammals will experience. In doing so, they observed that although the RBM3 protein helped healthy mice to preserve brain function, it appeared not to work in the mice with Alzheimer\u2019s.\n\nThe enzyme exists in humans, but, like in the mice, for reasons not yet known, doesn\u2019t work in Alzheimer\u2019s patients.\n\nAlthough we often associate hibernation as a sort of deep sleep for animals, in reality it's more similar to a deep freeze \u2014 like the cryogenics we see in science fiction. It\u2019s this freezing property that helps to retain brain cells. Cold temperatures have also been observed to help preserve brain function. For example, people who suffer cardiac arrest after falling into icy water have been shown to have no brain damage despite oxygen being cut off for extended periods. Also, it\u2019s common for doctors to cool the brains of babies who experience oxygen deprivation at birth as a way to protect the brains from possible damage. While in theory freezing does well to preserve brain function, in reality, freezing the brains of Alzheimer\u2019s patients is not a reasonable solution.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve known for some time that cooling can slow down or even prevent damage to brain cells, but reducing body temperature is rarely feasible in practice: it\u2019s unpleasant and involves risks such as pneumonia and blood clots,\" Professor Giovanna Mallucci, who led the research team, explained to The Telegraph.\n\nThe team hopes it can solve this problem by creating a drug similar to RBM3, which would work on Alzheimer\u2019s patients without the need for deep freeze.\n\n\"Just as anti-inflammatory drugs are preferable to cold baths in bringing down a high temperature, we need to find drugs which can induce the effects of hibernation and hypothermia,\u201d added Dr. Hugh Perry, chairman of the MRC\u2019s Neurosciences and Mental Health Board, which funded the research.\n\nSource: Mallucci GR, Peretti D, Bastide A.
