And AccuWeather Inc. is predicting rain in the morning, shifting to wet snow in the afternoon Wednesday, with the worst travel conditions and slippery roads from midafternoon into the evening.

AccuWeather senior meteorologist Dave Dombek said the storm, expected to hit the Northeastern and Mid-Atlantic United States, will likely disrupt Thanksgiving travel. He said he expects at least some weather-related flight delays, possibly some significant.

While he said Philadelphia is unlikely to see more than a slushy inch or two of snow sticking, he predicts more accumulation to the north and west of the city, with mostly rain to the south in Delaware and along the Jersey Shore.

Problems driving would mostly be expected to the north and west of Philadelphia on Wednesday, Dombek said. Thanksgiving is looking cold but dry, with some wind, but nothing significant enough to affect the parade, he said.

The swings in weather from cold to warm to snow are not unusual for this time of year. Fall is a transition season and a "roller coaster ride in temperature" is typical even late in the season, Dombek said. The highs and lows have no bearing on the winter to come.

Monday also saw a record high 71 degrees for a Nov. 24 in Allentown and Reading while Trenton tied its record of 71.
