This month, doctors in China were able to reattach his hand after first attaching it to Wei\u2019s ankle for a month to preserve it while they repaired his right arm. \u201cHis injury was severe. Besides ripping injuries, his arm was also flattened. We had to clear and treat his injuries before taking on the hand reattachment surgery,\u201d his doctor explained, according to the NY Daily News.\n\nApparently, Wei\u2019s hand got caught in a machine at work. \u201cI was just shocked and frozen at the spot, until co-workers unplugged the machine and retrieved my hand and took me to the hospital,\u201d he said, according to the Daily Mail. Wei was eventually taken to Changsha Hospital in China\u2019s Hunan province where doctors were hopeful that they\u2019d be able to reattach the hand, but they knew they couldn\u2019t do it right away due to the severe trauma his right arm had gone through. To ensure the hand would be reattachable, doctors decided to place the hand on his ankle.\n\nA month later, Wei\u2019s hand was finally removed from his ankle and reattached to his wrist. Doctors say that Wei will probably have to undergo a few more surgeries, but they\u2019re confident that he will regain full use of the previously severed hand.\n\n\u201cI am still young, and I couldn't imagine life without a right hand,\u201d Wei said.\n\nView photos of Wei\u2019s hand below:\n\nPhoto Credit: Reuters Reuters Photo Credit: Reuters Reuters Photo Credit: Reuters Reuters", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "severed hand, ankle, china", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Doctors in China attached Xiao Wei's severed right hand to his ankle for a month while operating on his injured arm.", "title": "Man\u2019s Severed Hand Saved By Attaching It To His Ankle [GRAPHIC PHOTOS]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/severed-hand-saved-attaching-it-ankle-doctors-china-expect-patient-regain-hand-function-graphic", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/12/17/tag-reuters.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Doctors in China attached Xiao Wei's severed right hand to his ankle for a month while operating on his injured arm.", "title": "Man\u2019s Severed Hand Saved By Attaching It To His Ankle [GRAPHIC PHOTOS]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/severed-hand-saved-attaching-it-ankle-doctors-china-expect-patient-regain-hand-function-graphic", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/12/17/tag-reuters.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/12/17/tag-reuters.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2013-12-17T14:21:31-05:00", "modified_time": "2013-12-17T14:21:29-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Doctors in China attached Xiao Wei's severed right hand to his ankle for a month while operating on his injured arm."}, "article_summary": "On Nov. 10, Xiao Wei\u2019s right hand was severed in an accident at the factory where he works.\n\u201cI am still young, and I couldn't imagine life without a right hand,\u201d Wei said.\nView photos of Wei\u2019s hand below:Photo Credit: Reuters Reuters Photo Credit: Reuters Reuters Photo Credit: Reuters Reuters\nA month later, Wei\u2019s hand was finally removed from his ankle and reattached to his wrist.\nThis month, doctors in China were able to reattach his hand after first attaching it to Wei\u2019s ankle for a month to preserve it while they repaired his right arm."}
