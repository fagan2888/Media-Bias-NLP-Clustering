Lerner\u2019s emails apparently disappeared in a hard-drive crash, the revelation is the latest dent in President Obama\u2019s vow to run a transparent administration.\n\nSEE ALSO: Jon Stewart: IRS, federal government behavior \u2018borders on criminal idiocy\u2019\n\n\u201cThe Obama administration has lost or destroyed emails for more than 20 witnesses, and in each case, the loss wasn\u2019t disclosed to the National Archives or Congress for months or years, in violation of federal law,\u201d said House Oversight and Government Reform Committee Chairman Darrell E. Issa, a California Republican who has been leading congressional investigations into IRS targeting and into Obamacare.\n\nMr. Issa said he only now found out about the lost emails, in a letter from an assistant secretary, despite having issued a subpoena for the documents in October.\n\n\u201cYet again, we discover that this administration will not be forthright with the American people unless cornered,\u201d Mr. Issa said.\n\nAaron Albright, a spokesman for Ms. Tavenner, said the \u201cvast majority\u201d of her emails are likely retrievable and more than 71,000 that have been identified might be responsive to the subpoena.\n\nHe said that set of emails has no \u201csignificant chronological gaps.\u201d\n\nBut HHS didn\u2019t inform the National Archives of the lost emails until Wednesday, a day before the department told Congress.\n\n\u201cBased on a recent analysis of emails (which was completed on July 31, 2014) undertaken in connection with a request from a congressional committee, it appears that most, but not all, of the Administrator\u2019s email records were sent within HHS and therefore were likely saved within HHS records,\u201d Kathleen Cantwell, an HHS records management official, said in an official notification to the Archives.\n\n\u201cWhile we have not identified any specific emails that we will be unable to retrieve, it is possible that some emails may not be available to HHS, and we are therefore filing this memorandum,\u201d she wrote.\n\nHHS said it didn\u2019t know for sure that records were lost, but it was filing the notice \u201cout of an abundance of caution.\u201d\n\nThe IRS took heat this year for failing to inform the Archives that some of Ms. Lerner\u2019s emails were destroyed in a 2011 computer hard-drive crash. Under federal rules, the Archives must be notified whenever potential official records required to be stored for posterity are lost.\n\nIn Ms. Lerner\u2019s case, the Justice Department is looking into the loss of emails as part of a broader criminal investigation into IRS targeting of conservative groups.\n\nMr. Obama took office promising to make transparency a priority, but his agencies have come under fire repeatedly for delays and problems with meeting open records laws.\n\nA Washington Times analysis last month found that few agencies have policies governing storage of instant chats or text messages, even though they are considered electronic records subject to open records laws. HHS, however, was one of the few agencies surveyed by The Times that did have a policy.\n\nDemocrats say document retention problems go back years and appear to be a system issue.\n\n\u201cThis is another example of why we need to update and strengthen the policies surrounding the preservation of email records across all federal agencies, which my legislation would do,\u201d said Rep. Elijah Cummings, the ranking Democrat on the oversight committee.\n\nHe has written a bill to require the government to store email records electronically \u2014 currently some agencies have a policy that emails are to be printed out in paper form. Mr. Cummings\u2019 legislation would also update standards for what records are required to be stored.\n\nIn its notification this week, HHS also presented the Archives with the outlines of its plan to prevent record losses in the future, including ensuring training and, eventually, creating a system to automatically store all senior officials\u2019 emails.\n\nCongress has been probing HHS management of the federal HealthCare.gov portal for buying insurance under the Affordable Care Act after the website was plagued with glitches. The administration had to extend the enrollment deadlines to sign up more consumers.\n\nHouse Republicans have questioned whether officials launched the site despite cybersecurity warnings.\n\nMs. Tavenner\u2019s emails are part of those probes.\n\nIn his notification to Mr. Issa, HHS Assistant Secretary Jim R. Esquea said staffers have spent a combined 23,000 hours trying to respond to the committee\u2019s requests, including providing nearly 135,000 pages of documents and submitting to more than a dozen interviews with current or former department employees.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Obama administration admitted Thursday it has lost emails from the key official who oversaw the botched rollout of the federal Obamacare website, and may have broken the law by failing to report the problem to the National Archives.", "Author": "Stephen Dinan", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "The Obama administration admitted Thursday it has lost emails from the key official who oversaw the botched rollout of the federal Obamacare website, and may have broken the law by failing to report the problem to the National Archives.", "title": "Lost emails scandal spreads to top Obamacare official", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/aug/7/lost-emails-scandal-spreads-top-obamacare-official/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/08/07/obama-veterans-health-carejpeg-0f169.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/08/07/obama-veterans-health-carejpeg-0f169.jpg", "title": "Lost emails scandal spreads to top Obamacare official", "description": "The Obama administration admitted Thursday it has lost emails from the key official who oversaw the botched rollout of the federal Obamacare website, and may have broken the law by failing to report t", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda288\"", "article_summary": "The Obama administration admitted Thursday that it has lost emails from the key official who oversaw the botched federal Obamacare rollout last year, and the health department may have broken the law by failing to report the lost emails to the National Archives.\nUnder federal rules, the Archives must be notified whenever potential official records required to be stored for posterity are lost.\nMr. Issa said he only now found out about the lost emails, in a letter from an assistant secretary, despite having issued a subpoena for the documents in October.\nHe said that set of emails has no \u201csignificant chronological gaps.\u201dBut HHS didn\u2019t inform the National Archives of the lost emails until Wednesday, a day before the department told Congress.\n\u201cYet again, we discover that this administration will not be forthright with the American people unless cornered,\u201d Mr. Issa said."}
