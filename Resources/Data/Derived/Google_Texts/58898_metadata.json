The company is only the seventh health technology provider globally to have been granted this certification by ICHOM. HealthLoop launched patient reported outcome measures (PROMs) as part of its suite of engagement products in March, 2015.\n\nHealth outcome measures and PROMs have become increasingly crucial elements of healthcare, both internationally and under the reform taking place in the U.S. with the Affordable Care Act. ICHOM convenes international working groups of leading clinicians, researchers, and patients to develop Standard Sets of outcome measures for the most relevant medical conditions. Standardizing these outcome measures enables better care by allowing patients to share their progress in ways that are both patient-centric and clinically meaningful.\n\n\u201cHealthLoop brings a unique blend of patient-physician engagement to the health outcomes measurement space that will undoubtedly continue to raise the bar on both the quality and quantity of outcomes reported by patients,\u201d said Jacob Lippa, ICHOM\u2019s Director of Global Implementation.\n\nWith HealthLoop PROMs, questionnaires are automatically delivered to patients as part of an ongoing, interactive dialogue with their healthcare teams at baseline and before and after the encounter. More than 80 percent of patients enrolled in HealthLoop are actively engaged and answering health questions, an industry-leading survey completion rate.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re honored to have received Certified Supplier designation from ICHOM and look forward to working with them in the years ahead,\u201d said Ben Rosner, MD, PhD, CMIO of HealthLoop. \u201cICHOM has created an impressive collection of widely accepted outcome measurement sets that will enable healthcare providers to learn best practice from one another in ways not previously possible. And in the emerging world of value-based care, doing so is becoming increasingly important for providers and healthcare systems to demonstrate quality. Having added PROMs to our existing patient-physician engagement platform and enabling the capture of ICHOM\u2019s Standard Sets such as the Hip and Knee Osteoarthritis Set was an obvious choice that will benefit both the patients and physicians we serve.\u201d\n\nICHOM is launching the first international Standard Set on hip and knee osteoarthritis next week. Medical professionals interested in arthritis and joint care are invited to RSVP for a webinar hosted by ICHOM\u2019s Working Group on hip and knee osteoarthritis on July 8, 2015, at 4:00 p.m. EDT to learn more about this advancement in the measurement of orthopedic care.\n\nAdditionally, healthcare providers choosing to use ICHOM\u2019s Standard Sets will receive a 15 percent discount on HealthLoop\u2019s PROMs collection tools.\n\nABOUT HEALTHLOOP\n\nHealthLoop keeps doctors, patients, and caregivers connected between visits with clinical information that is insightful, actionable, and engaging. HealthLoop\u2019s peer-reviewed, detailed follow-up plans proactively communicate routine aspects of care while tracking patient progress and monitoring clinical areas of concern, boosting efficiency and improving outcomes through patient engagement.
