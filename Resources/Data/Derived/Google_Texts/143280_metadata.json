But when I read the comments under these same articles, I realize that we have exactly the government we deserve. It would be hard to imagine a government more dysfunctional and divided than the comments section of the Washington Post.\n\nDon\u2019t disagree with a position until you can paraphrase that position to the satisfaction of the person who holds it. Michael Austin\n\nI say this as someone who believes that spirited public debate is one of the most important things that the citizens of a free republic can do. Our political system was set up to produce arguments; it cannot function without them. Nonetheless, I cannot imagine a more soul-destroying activity than reading the comment section of a publicly available news or blog site. This is because people almost never argue in such forums\u2014they just call each other names and sneer a lot.\n\nIt is relatively easy to call somebody stupid or evil, even when it involves thinking up new adjectives to say the same things. Sneering sarcasm is not much harder, nor are personal criticisms and broad-brushed partisan attacks. We\u2019re good at that stuff. We are primates after all, and members of our species have been throwing poo at each other for millions of years.\n\nIn theory, at least, human beings can do better. Thousands of years ago, a Greek rhetorician named Hermagoras developed a series of protocols to identify the point of stasis\u2014or the point where the participants in an argument have actually agreed about the question that they disagree about. Until an argument evolves to a point of stasis, it is almost certainly not going to be an argument\u2014just a joint appearance by people being as unpleasant as possible to each other.\n\nThere has been a lot of good stuff written about stasis theory, but the basics are pretty simple: the types of claims that people make can be divided into four general categories, which the Greeks called conjectural, definitional, qualitative, and translative\u2014but which modern rhetoricians mercifully now call \u201cquestions of fact,\u201d \u201cquestions of value,\u201d \u201cquestions of policy,\u201d and \u201cquestions of definition.\u201d Most shouting matches never really become arguments because participants make no effort to understand what kinds of claims are really at issue.\n\nBut now we are straying into specialist jargon, which isn\u2019t even necessary. All you have to do to have a real argument, and not a shouting match, is follow one simple rule. Here it is: Don\u2019t disagree with a position until you can paraphrase that position to the satisfaction of the person who holds it. In this way, you will always agree about what you are disagreeing about, which is essentially what \u201creaching the point of stasis\u201d means. And as it turns out, this simple human courtesy will convert 99% of unpleasant disagreements into actual arguments with the potential to educate, inform, and influence opinion.\n\nOver the next few weeks, I plan to use this space to expand on some of these issues and discuss ways to make political arguments, if not pleasant experiences, at least educational ones. And these strategies have the added advantage of not destroying relationships or making you look like an incorrigible jerk\u2013or a chimpanzee slinging a big wad of its own poo.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "making political arguments, politics", "og": {"site_name": "IVN.us", "description": "All you have to do to have a real argument, and not a shouting match, is follow one simple rule.
