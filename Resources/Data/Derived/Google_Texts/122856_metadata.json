(Melina Mara/The Washington Post)\n\nThe road that Hillary Clinton hopes to take to the White House travels right through suburban Virginia and places like it: diverse, moderate and burgeoning with young families.\n\nClinton\u2019s campaign stop Monday afternoon at Mug \u2019n Muffin coffeehouse in Loudoun County offered a window into her strategy to win those voters.\n\nShe largely ignored presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump and focused instead on bread-and-butter issues for suburban families: child-care costs, paid family leave, college tuition. But the strategy is a tacit, detail-laden critique of Clinton\u2019s likely opponent, for whom policy has been a secondary feature.\n\nTrump spent the weekend ratcheting up attacks on Clinton over the scandals of the 1990s during her husband\u2019s administration. He accused her of being an \u201cenabler\u201d of Bill Clinton\u2019s infidelity.\n\nAsked about those accusations on Monday, Hillary Clinton declined to respond.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to let him run his campaign however he chooses,\u201d she told reporters. \u201cI\u2019m going to run my campaign, which is a positive vision for our country with specific plans.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have nothing to say about him,\u201d she added.\n\nClinton\u2019s general election is about married women. Starting in this swing state]\n\nMothers, fathers and their restless children sat around her as Clinton emphasized her support for family-focused policies \u2014 an apparent effort to remind voters of her long history with such issues.\n\n\u201c \u2018Blue Train, Green Train,\u2019 \u201d Clinton remarked as she greeted families, zeroing in on a colorful book held by a young boy. \u201cI know about that.\u201d\n\nAdvocating for paid family leave, she said she supported new mothers having at least three months of leave to bond with their children.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like to see more, if that\u2019s possible \u2014 to bond with your baby, to get to know how to be a mom,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cThere were a lot of things I didn\u2019t know when I had Chelsea years ago.\u201d\n\nHours later, she snapped selfies with parents and preschoolers at a KinderCare facility nearby.\n\nLoudoun County was her first general-election-focused campaign stop since Trump became the presumptive Republican nominee \u2014 Virginia has already held its primary \u2014 and it highlighted the suburb\u2019s key role in this election.\n\nLoudoun narrowly went for President Obama in 2012, but the county is at the western edge of densely populated, liberal Northern Virginia, so its voters still sometimes lean conservative. Virginia\u2019s 10th Congressional District, which includes all of Loudoun and is represented by Republican Barbara Comstock, is a target for Democrats seeking to flip the seat blue.\n\nIt is in communities like this that Clinton is hoping to turn out African American, Asian and Latino voters, in addition to younger or middle-aged white women.\n\n[Clinton and Trump, two intensely disliked candidates, begin their face-off]\n\n\u201cPeople like me, I\u2019m definitely going to support her,\u201d said Cliff Gyamfi, who is African American. \u201cBut it\u2019s going to be those swing voters, independents.\u201d\n\nThe father of two sons, Gyamfi reflects the rapidly changing demographics of this part of the state. He and his wife, who is white, worry about Trump\u2019s rhetoric and what it means for their children.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s got major concerns,\u201d Gyamfi said of his wife. \u201cShe has black sons, so she\u2019s concerned about racial profiling and what happens there.\u201d\n\nThe neighborhood Clinton visited Monday, Stone Ridge, is about half minority, according to the most recent census. Young, professional and middle-class families constitute a significant subset of this group. They serve as a potentially rich voting bloc for Clinton, who is seeking to not only turn out the Democratic base but also sway swing independent and Republican voters her way.\n\nDemocrats also hope that Trump will repel traditionally Republican-leaning voters \u2014 including evangelicals \u2014 prompting many of them to stay home in November.\n\n[Hillary Clinton is calling Donald Trump a hypocrite on the middle class]\n\nSchatem Boyd, 34, who has a 2-year-old daughter, said she is at a crossroads in this election.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always known who I was going to vote for,\u201d said Boyd, a Republican small-business owner. But this year, she found herself sitting five feet away from Clinton.\n\n\u201cIf it\u2019s going to be the election that it\u2019s shaping up to be between Trump and Hillary, I don\u2019t feel comfortable voting for the Republican candidate as it stands,\u201d Boyd said.\n\nBut she has concerns about the Affordable Care Act, telling Clinton that her family\u2019s monthly health insurance premiums have increased by hundreds of dollars in the past few years.\n\n\u201cWhat you\u2019re saying is one of the real worries that we\u2019re facing with the cost of health insurance,\u201d Clinton told Boyd. \u201cThe costs are going up in a lot of markets.\u201d\n\nClinton suggested that government subsidies that help individuals and families pay for insurance premiums shouldn\u2019t just be cut off at certain income levels. Instead, she suggested, they should gradually diminish as incomes rise. Clinton also floated the possibility of allowing people to buy into the Medicare program as one way of establishing a \u201cpublic option\u201d and reducing the cost of health care\n\nHer answers highlighted a key difference between the leading Republican and Democratic candidates. If Trump looks to make the election flashy entertainment, Clinton aims to make it more of a policy conference. Her talk centered on \u201ctax incentives,\u201d \u201cprograms\u201d and \u201crobust structures\u201d to help resolve some issues facing families.\n\nAsked whether she would seek to respond to Trump\u2019s personal attacks, Clinton countered by saying that his statements on issues such as nuclear policy and terrorism make him a \u201cloose cannon.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m answering him on what I think voters care about,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m answering him on the differences between our records, our experience, what we want to do for our country, how important it is to try to unify the country, and I have been very clear that a lot of his rhetoric is not only reckless, it\u2019s dangerous.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The diverse Virginia county was her first general-election-focused stop since Trump became the presumptive GOP nominee.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/abbydphillip", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "The diverse Virginia county was her first general-election-focused stop since Trump became the presumptive GOP nominee.", "title": "Virginia\u2019s rapidly changing Loudoun County is testing ground for Clinton as she courts swing vote", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/rapidly-changing-loudoun-is-testing-ground-for-clinton-as-she-courts-swing-vote/2016/05/09/b53a3068-1606-11e6-9e16-2e5a123aac62_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2016/05/09/Others/Images/2016-05-09/hrc101462829530.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@abbydphillip"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/rapidly-changing-loudoun-is-testing-ground-for-clinton-as-she-courts-swing-vote/2016/05/09/b53a3068-1606-11e6-9e16-2e5a123aac62_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/abbydphillip"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "eomportal-uuid": "b53a3068-1606-11e6-9e16-2e5a123aac62"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3e94\"", "article_summary": "Asked about those accusations on Monday, Hillary Clinton declined to respond.\nSurrounded by small-business owners and families, Hillary Clinton participates in a \"Discussion with Women and Families on Work-Life Balance and Family Issues\" in Loudoun County\u2019s Stone Ridge community.\n\u201cWhat you\u2019re saying is one of the real worries that we\u2019re facing with the cost of health insurance,\u201d Clinton told Boyd.\nTrump spent the weekend ratcheting up attacks on Clinton over the scandals of the 1990s during her husband\u2019s administration.\nThey serve as a potentially rich voting bloc for Clinton, who is seeking to not only turn out the Democratic base but also sway swing independent and Republican voters her way."}
