But he said he still holds out hope for a diplomatic resolution based on the withdrawal of Russian forces to their bases in Crimea, the introduction of international monitors into the region and a dialogue between Moscow and the government in Kiev.\n\nThe sanctions ordered by the Obama administration include asset freezes and a ban on travel to the United States for seven Russian and four Ukrainian officials, including ousted Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych. The sanctions by the European Union apply to 21 officials, although those people have not yet been identified.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s actions send a strong message to the Russian government that there are consequences for their actions that violate the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine, including their actions supporting the illegal referendum for Crimean separation,\u201d the White House said in a statement.\n\nU.S. officials said those being sanctioned were either Putin \u201ccronies\u201d or political leaders who have been instrumental in either promoting the referendum in Crimea or military escalations. A senior administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the E.U. made \u201cslight different choices\u201d in its determination of whom to sanction.\n\nThe \u201clists have overlap both in terms of names and in terms of categories of people,\u201d the official said.\n\nThe announcement in Washington came as E.U. foreign ministers met in Brussels to decide how hard to push Moscow a day after Crimeans voted to secede in a referendum that was condemned in Washington and in capitals across Europe.\n\nRelated: Russian Ties to Ukraine Go Much Deeper Than Gas\n\nA European Union statement called on Russia to end its military buildup in Crimea and to decline to annex the territory, warning of \u201cadditional and far-reaching consequences for relations in a broad range of economic areas\u201d if Russia does not back down.\n\nLithuanian Foreign Minister Linas Linkevicius said on Twitter that there would be more penalties imposed by Europe within days.\n\nSeveral Eastern European nations have pushed for particularly tough sanctions, fearing that unchecked Russian advances in Ukraine could set a bad precedent that could directly affect their borders. But European Union heavyweights such as Germany and Britain have deep economic ties to Russia, and officials have spent days wrangling over whether the sanctions should hit at Putin\u2019s inner circle.\n\nThe Obama administration promised last week to exact a cost if the vote in Crimea were held \u2014 even before new Russian military exercises on Ukraine\u2019s eastern and southern borders and Saturday\u2019s seizure of a Ukrainian gas plant just beyond Crimea\u2019s northern boundary.\n\nThe question for the West is whether harsh retribution now will make Russian President Vladi\u00admir Putin more or less likely to desist from further action. Although he has so far been impervious to American and European threats, U.S. officials think that the cost the upheaval has already imposed on the Russian economy will become unbearable if Putin does not yield.\n\nThe West could also suffer costs if Russia cuts off energy supplies to Europe and further squeezes the Ukrainian economy. But Western officials say that is a price they are willing to pay and have pledged economic support to Ukraine.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The Washington Post.\n\nRead more at The Washington Post:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The United States and the European Union on Monday slapped sanctions on Russian and Uk", "title": "7 Russians Slapped with U.S. Sanctions", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/03/17/7-Russians-Slapped-US-Sanctions", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/03172014_Ukraine_Russian_Soldiers.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/03/17/7-Russians-Slapped-US-Sanctions", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/03172014_Ukraine_Russian_Soldiers.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "The United States and the European Union on Monday slapped sanctions on Russian and Uk", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb336\"", "article_summary": "The sanctions by the European Union apply to 21 officials, although those people have not yet been identified.\nThe United States and the European Union on Monday slapped sanctions on Russian and Ukrainian officials deemed responsible for Crimea\u2019s effort to join Russia, following through on a pledge by the West before Sunday\u2019s secession referendum in Crimea.\nThe sanctions ordered by the Obama administration include asset freezes and a ban on travel to the United States for seven Russian and four Ukrainian officials, including ousted Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych.\nBut European Union heavyweights such as Germany and Britain have deep economic ties to Russia, and officials have spent days wrangling over whether the sanctions should hit at Putin\u2019s inner circle.\nSeveral Eastern European nations have pushed for particularly tough sanctions, fearing that unchecked Russian advances in Ukraine could set a bad precedent that could directly affect their borders."}
