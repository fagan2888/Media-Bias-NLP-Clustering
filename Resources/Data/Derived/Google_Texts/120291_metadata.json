The allegations link Togus for the first time to issues similar to those at veterans\u2019 hospitals nationwide that sparked a scandal earlier this year.\n\nOfficials from the Office of the Inspector General in the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs visited Togus in late October to interview employees and review documents in connection with the allegations, but haven\u2019t filed a report yet and haven\u2019t commented on the investigation\u2019s specifics. Lilly said he doesn\u2019t expect the report to come out for at least three months.\n\nThe inspector general\u2019s office has been mum on the reasons for the probe, which was requested by the office of U.S. Rep. Mike Michaud, an outgoing Democrat from Maine\u2019s 2nd Congressional District whose office hasn\u2019t said who the allegations came from.\n\nHowever, the claims match concerns held by current and former employees at Togus who have spoken with the Kennebec Journal over the past five months but weren\u2019t willing to speak publicly. Lilly acknowledged problems with morale among staff in mental health, a unit that he said has had trouble attracting psychiatrists and psychologists and has been understaffed in recent years.\n\nThe October memo was written by Melanie Krause, associate director of clinical review management at the inspector general\u2019s office. It says that Togus employees may have left out information from patient files about mental illnesses, which may have stemmed from combat service and required treatment. Togus allegedly did this to tamp down the number of veterans seeking care at provider centers across the state, the memo says.\n\nFurthermore, it says that Togus officials could have presided over scheduling ploys that masked the true periods of time that mental health patients waited for appointments. Veterans advocates said they were worried by the claims.\n\n\u201cI go to my doctor and I\u2019m trusting that they know what they\u2019re doing,\u201d said Gary Burns of Augusta, a retired service officer for Disabled American Veterans in Maine who was injured in the Vietnam War. \u201cThis is a violation, to some degree, of that trust, and that concerns me.\u201d\n\nGAMING THE SYSTEM?\n\nOmissions in patient files may be the most serious allegation that drew the inspector general\u2019s office in the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs to the Togus campus for an inspection of mental health services last month.\n\nIn the short term, those alleged omissions would mean that veterans may have gone without care. Long term, incomplete records could leave veterans unable to prove they\u2019re eligible for benefits providing needed counseling. Lilly, though, said he told the inspector general\u2019s office he had not seen evidence of \u201can instruction to omit things\u201d as a strategy at Togus, and he has no proof that claims were affected.\n\nStill, Joseph Moore, a lawyer at Bergmann & Moore, a Maryland firm handling veterans\u2019 benefits appeals claims, said if substantiated, that claim \u201cis absolutely huge\u201d and would mean that \u201cadministrators got treatment providers to lie, to the obvious and direct detriment of the veterans they were treating.\u201d\n\nEven so, Moore and others cautioned that issues alleged at Togus are similar to VA problems nationwide, including a shortage of health professionals that the federal department\u2019s new secretary, Robert McDonald, wants to fix.\n\n\u201cIf it\u2019s happening here, it\u2019s happening all over the country,\u201d said John Wallace, of Limestone, an Army veteran and the president of Vietnam Veterans of America in Maine.\n\nGaming of wait lists has been alleged at VA hospitals nationwide since earlier this year, when whistleblowers at a Phoenix VA hospital said separate lists were kept: One was public and electronic, while the other was offline, secret and kept to falsify patients\u2019 real wait times. Similar manipulation was also reported at VA hospitals in Chicago, Colorado and Texas.\n\nTogus avoided scrutiny around wait times when the national scandal broke, as its 2013 records showed that more than 98 percent of established primary-care patients \u2014 those who have attended the hospital before \u2014 got appointments within 14 days of requesting them.\n\nVA policy says first-time patients requesting services should receive a preliminary evaluation within a day and a more comprehensive exam within 14 days. The October memo, though, details allegations that Togus mental health officials also worked to manipulate wait time records.\n\nAdministrators whose hospitals meet certain benchmarks such as the 14-day wait time get bonuses, and protecting those incentives has been cited as a reason for wait-time manipulation nationwide. A VA audit conducted in May said these practices were \u201csufficiently pervasive\u201d to require a federal review of \u201cwhether current measures and targets for access are realistic or sufficient.\u201d\n\nTo meet the same-day requirement for preliminary evaluations, Krause wrote that for several weeks, Togus allegedly stopped scheduling advance mental health appointments in lieu of drop-in appointments, which wouldn\u2019t be tracked. For some time, Togus officials allegedly refused services to patients who weren\u2019t willing to be seen within 14 days and certain referrals weren\u2019t tracked, Krause wrote.\n\nBut Lilly said he hasn\u2019t seen evidence of that, noting that those waiting times are just one factor of many that administrators are evaluated on. In September, wait times in Maine for mental health services were nearly 17 days, just above the national average, according to VA data. Lilly said using drop-in appointments wouldn\u2019t necessarily ease the hospital\u2019s workload, because future appointments are often scheduled at those clinics.\n\nBurns and other advocates said veterans aren\u2019t bringing new concerns to them regarding long waits in mental health at Togus, but some of the issues could be difficult for individual veterans to notice. Kennebec County Sheriff Randall Liberty, an Army veteran who is treated for post-traumatic stress disorder at Togus, said he is always seen promptly.\n\nOf the allegations, he said, \u201cThat just hasn\u2019t been my experience.\u201d\n\nSTAFFING CONCERNS\n\nStaff shortages at Togus could explain other allegations in Krause\u2019s memo. Nationally, low staffing levels at VA hospitals have been a concern.\n\nPresident Barack Obama signed a bill in August that provided funding to hire thousands of doctors, nurses and other health professionals. Between 2009 and 2013, the number of veterans getting VA healthcare rose by 14 percent nationwide, with many Iraq and Afghanistan veterans among them.\n\nDemand for mental health services has gone up as well. In Maine, mental health consults \u2014 or appointment requests \u2014 went up by more than 30 percent between 2011 and 2014, according to Togus data, while staff numbers fluctuated from 80 in 2012, to 72 in 2013, and to 79 now. The Maine VA health care system has about 1,400 employees.\n\nThere are still 10 mental health vacancies at Togus, Lilly said, and he noted that high-level employees, including psychiatrists, must be on-call at times at Togus \u2014 unlike requirements at other health providers. That responsibility, among other factors, makes it difficult to fill vacancies, he said. Lilly said he has heard from staff members who wonder if their workloads are being made intentionally larger because Togus won\u2019t hire people.\n\nThat\u2019s not true, he said, because they\u2019ve been trying to fill vacancies.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m concerned about the morale,\u201d Lilly said. \u201cI\u2019m concerned about our ability to recruit. We\u2019ve had struggles.\u201d\n\nBut Lilly said he hasn\u2019t seen those factors as an indication that veterans get worse service because of it. Krause\u2019s memo, though, said patients were allegedly put into group sessions and other programs to meet benchmarks for timely care, \u201cdespite staff concerns about the clinical appropriateness of these practices.\u201d Krause also wrote that the hospital may have relied on nurse practitioners to see patients for medication management \u201ceven though this was outside of their scope of practice.\u201d\n\nAgain, Lilly said he hasn\u2019t seen evidence of those allegations. But Maine veterans advocates have long complained of low staffing levels, particularly in mental health.\n\n\u201cThey need more mental health beds,\u201d said Gary Laweryson, of Waldoboro, chairman of the Maine Veterans Coordinating Committee, a group of veterans service organizations, \u201cand they need more mental health people that are good at what they do.\u201d\n\nMichael Shepherd \u2014 370-7652\n\n[email protected]\n\nTwitter: @mikeshepherdme", "article_metadata": {"description": "An October memo by a federal watchdog agency outlines allegations that, if proven, would link Maine for the first time to issues similar to those at veterans hospitals nationwide.", "generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Central Maine", "description": "An October memo by a federal watchdog agency outlines allegations that, if proven, would link Maine for the first time to issues similar to those at veterans hospitals nationwide.", "title": "Togus VA system probed over allegations of shortcuts, omissions - Central Maine", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 999, "identifier": "http://www.centralmaine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/345298_576107-20141120-togus_08A.jpg", "height": 714}, "updated_time": "2014-11-23T21:33:30-04:00", "url": "http://www.centralmaine.com/2014/11/22/togus-va-system-probed-over-allegations-of-shortcuts-omissions/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.centralmaine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/345298_576107-20141120-togus_08A.jpg", "description": "An October memo by a federal watchdog agency outlines allegations that, if proven, would link Maine for the first time to issues similar to those at veterans hospitals nationwide.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Togus VA system probed over allegations of shortcuts, omissions - Central Maine"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=966680591", "fb": {"app_id": 754222714628811}, "article": {"section": "Healthcare", "published_time": "2014-11-22T17:34:22-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-11-23T21:33:30-04:00"}, "google-site-verification": "DT-FwcrUrXtAltcTNXUsA7tR4Ha0CLErawYbGlkpg94", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe23c4\"", "article_summary": "The October memo, though, details allegations that Togus mental health officials also worked to manipulate wait time records.\nTOGUS \u2014 Allegations that officials at the VA Maine Healthcare System took shortcuts and withheld information from patient files in an effort to meet national benchmarks have prompted a federal probe of services there.\nThe Maine VA health care system has about 1,400 employees.\nIn September, wait times in Maine for mental health services were nearly 17 days, just above the national average, according to VA data.\nDemand for mental health services has gone up as well."}
