After the moderators attempted to \u201cfocus on the elephant that\u2019s not in the room\u201d in the first segment, though, the candidates mainly ignored Trump to debate each other. Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz got the most time to speak, and also the most preparation from the moderators, making it look at times as though these were the top two candidates in Iowa.\n\nFrank Luntz\u2019 ubiquitous focus group called the debate for Rubio:\n\nThey weren\u2019t terribly happy with Donald Trump for skipping the debate, but only a few thought it would matter. One concluded that it hurt Cruz the most, and that might have been Trump\u2019s strategy:\n\nI thought most of the candidates in both debates acquitted themselves reasonably well, with the exception of Ben Carson, who still looked out of his depth on stage. At one point, Carson appeared surprised to take a question, and his answer showed that he wasn\u2019t prepared for it when it came. Jim Gilmore offered a pretty good argument for an appointment as Secretary of Defense. Otherwise, for the most part, everyone other than Cruz and Rubio provided familiar performances and debate strategies, right down to Chris Christie\u2019s routine-but-still-effective \u201ca pox on Senators\u201d exclamation.\n\nBoth Cruz and Rubio came in with different strategies from previous debates, apparently hoping to fill the vacuum left by Trump. Cruz seemed to be looking to pick a fight with the moderators early, but got shut down by Chris Wallace rather firmly. Cruz also tried joking about walking off the stage if the moderators kept asking \u201cmean questions,\u201d but the audience didn\u2019t get the joke, and Rubio followed up by saying he would stick around no matter what questions got asked. It looked like Cruz tried a little too hard to mock Trump and ended up with a bit of egg on his face \u2014 but only for a moment.\n\nRubio came in looking to dominate by asserting himself more often, sticking to national security as much as possible, and pushing back hard on any criticism that came his way. For the most part that worked, although he and Cruz ended up getting tangled in previous statements on immigration aired by the moderators during the debate. Both took fire from others on stage during the exchanges \u2014 Rubio from Jeb Bush, Cruz from Rand Paul \u2014 that briefly set them back, but both rebounded well.\n\nAs the Luntz group also concluded, I felt Rubio did the most good for himself in the debate, but I also think Cruz did better than the Luntz group concluded. Will this change the direction of the race in Iowa? It could shuffle the order of the likely top-three finishers in Monday\u2019s caucuses \u2014 Trump, Cruz, and Rubio \u2014 but those will be the medal winners in any case.\n\nRubio also got the answer of the night in this 75-second clip. Washington Post reporter Aaron Blake quipped that \u201cthere was so much red meat, Ruth\u2019s Chris Steakhouse would be jealous.\u201d The only people who didn\u2019t love this were Bernie Sanders, Hillary Clinton, and the Swedes:\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "Sweden hardest hit.", "title": "Video: Luntz group declares Rubio winner of non-yuuuuge debate", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2016/01/29/video-luntz-group-declares-rubio-winner-of-non-yuuuuge-debate/", "image": {"secure_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/WVfQnYz9yr0/0.jpg", "identifier": "http://img.youtube.com/vi/WVfQnYz9yr0/0.jpg"}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary", "creator": "@EdMorrissey"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "keywords": "Donald Trump, Frank Luntz, GOP Debate, Iowa, Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz,", "article": {"published_time": "2016-01-29T13:41:07+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-01-29T14:55:26+00:00"}, "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "article_summary": "As the Luntz group also concluded, I felt Rubio did the most good for himself in the debate, but I also think Cruz did better than the Luntz group concluded.\nBoth Cruz and Rubio came in with different strategies from previous debates, apparently hoping to fill the vacuum left by Trump.\nFrank Luntz\u2019 ubiquitous focus group called the debate for Rubio:They weren\u2019t terribly happy with Donald Trump for skipping the debate, but only a few thought it would matter.\nRubio came in looking to dominate by asserting himself more often, sticking to national security as much as possible, and pushing back hard on any criticism that came his way.\nIt could shuffle the order of the likely top-three finishers in Monday\u2019s caucuses \u2014 Trump, Cruz, and Rubio \u2014 but those will be the medal winners in any case."}
