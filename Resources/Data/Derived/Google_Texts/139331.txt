Emergency crews were called to investigate a suspicious package at the Goodwill store in downtown Oklahoma City, Thursday morning.

Crews were called to the store, located near W. Reno Ave. and Blackwelder Ave., around 10:30 a.m.

Oklahoma City Police Capt. Dexter Nelson tells News 9 that the object is a possible explosive device, but says that is all the information they have at this time.

An employee at the Goodwill called police at 10:27 a.m. about a potential grenade found in a former employee's desk. They also told police they were going to self-evacuate.

Sometime later, a second potential grenade was discovered somewhere in their warehouse. Because the building sits so far off the road, police decided not to divert traffic on Reno.

Just before 10:50 p.m., Oklahoma City police determined that both devices were "not dangerous." Employees were allowed back inside the building.

Nelson tells News 9 the area will remain blocked momentarily while crews on scene load up their equipment and leave the scene.
