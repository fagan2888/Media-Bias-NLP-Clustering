And for snipers in particular, the wind and dusty terrain can make their job all the more challenging\u2014but maybe not for long.\n\nCalifornia\u2019s Teledyne Scientific & Imaging, LLC has developed a technology that allows .50 caliber bullets to change direction after they\u2019ve been fired. The EXACTO program, or Extreme Accuracy Tasked Ordnance, was developed for the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency.\n\n\u201cThe objective of the EXACTO program is to revolutionize rifle accuracy and range by developing the first ever guided small-caliber bullet,\u201d DARPA officials said in a statement this summer accompanying a YouTube video. \u201cThe EXACTO .50-caliber round and optical sighting technology expects to greatly extend the day and nighttime range over current state-of-the-art sniper systems.\u201d\n\nStars and Stripes has more:\n\nDARPA\u2019s statement announced that testing had been successful, a historical first. The video shows two rounds of testing, in February and April. A bullet was deliberately fired off target both times, then changed path. In the second test, it appears to have struck the intended target. Snipers generally operate in two-man teams \u2014 a shooter and a spotter \u2014 who have to make adjustment for a number of factors once they\u2019re in position. [\u2026] The Defense Department thinks it is \u201ccritical\u201d that snipers engage targets faster and more accurately, which will likely increase safety by concealing their location longer. DARPA hopes to give them EXACTO soon. The program\u2019s second phase, completed over the summer, provided a number of improvements, and the current phase will focus on a system-level live-fire test and further refinements, the statement said.\n\nWhile this top-secret technology may be helpful in taking down more terrorists, weapons experts do have concerns about the new program.\n\n[Ted Gatchel, professor emeritus at the Naval War College and expert in amphibious warfare, fortifications and small arms] also saw potential pitfalls in inserting technology into an arena marked by rough terrain, rain and sand. He used the analogy that a map will still work with a bullet hole in it, while a tablet or a computer might not. \u201cYou still need to train these snipers in the traditional methods,\u201d he said. \u201cRight now, sniping is a real precise art.\u201d [\u2026] The ability of the enemy to come up with effective countermeasures must also be taken into consideration. In World War II, the Germans employed a radio-controlled bomb called the Fritz X, Gatchel said, that sank the Italian battleship Roma and damaged a number of ships during the Allied landing at Salerno. Within just a few months, the Allies had developed a means of jamming the radio controls, thus rendering the bombs ineffective. And some weapons are so lethal that fears over the enemy capturing them and either reverse engineering or developing countermeasures can limit, or outweigh, their use.\n\nWhile the concerns about EXACTO are certainly valid, the new program is worth a shot nonetheless.
