Providers, in the short-term, should build more convenience, transparency, affordability, reliability and seamlessness into their revenue cycle and payment systems, according to PwC.\n\nIn the longer term, a sea change is needed, especially when it comes to the move to digital billing. The survey showed 76 percent of Medicare payment was sent electronically in 2013 and 65 percent of Medicare documentation was sent electronically. This compares to commercial health insurers, which conducted just 15 percent of payments and 27 percent of payment remittance advice electronically in 2013.\n\nFollow Healthcare Finance on Twitter and LinkedIn.\n\nThe U.S. business average is 43 percent electronic payment.\n\nThe affluent are the most dissatisfied with their insurer\u2019s billing and payment, with 33 percent reporting it not affordable, compared to 19 percent of the general population. Another 25 percent of more affluent patients were not confident in the bill\u2019s accuracy and 27 percent said the details of benefits were not easy to find. These findings were in comparison to 16 percent and 21 percent, respectively, of the general population.\n\nProviders need to incorporate online payment sites, mobile apps and aggregated billing as steps toward a simplified consumer experience, according to the study.\n\nThey also need to make it easier for consumers to plan for costs to reduce bad debt. High-deductible plans make it more important to consumers that they receive credit towards their deductible. Consumers lost in the complexity of their bills may abandon payment altogether, according to the survey.\n\nHealthcare providers who successfully transition may collect more of their patients\u2019 bills and they may collect them more quickly. They may be able to better manage cash flow, reduce reserves for bad debt and minimize administrative costs, according to PwC.\n\nClick on numbers below to see slides from the report.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/slideshow/study-healthcare-must-upgrade-billing-systems-avoid-poor-ratings", "image": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/Billing-statement-caption_0_1.gif", "site_name": "Healthcare Finance News", "description": "More than 31 percent of patients surveyed of said they were dissatisfied with the transparency of billing and payment from hospitals.", "title": "Study: Healthcare must upgrade billing systems to avoid poor ratings"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/Billing-statement-caption_0_1.gif"}, "description": "More than 31 percent of patients surveyed of said they were dissatisfied with the transparency of billing and payment from hospitals.", "site": "@HC_Finance", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Study: Healthcare must upgrade billing systems to avoid poor ratings"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "More than 31 percent of patients surveyed of said they were dissatisfied with the transparency of billing and payment from hospitals.", "viewport": "width=device-width; initial-scale=1.0; maximum-scale=1.0; user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2f40\"", "article_summary": "Healthcare providers need to upgrade their billing and payment systems if they want to tackle consumer dissatisfaction, a new report by PriceWaterhouse Cooper found.\nWith the exception of retail pharmacies, consumers are dissatisfied with healthcare billing and payment systems, according to a 2015 survey by PCW\u2019s Health Research Institute.\nProviders, in the short-term, should build more convenience, transparency, affordability, reliability and seamlessness into their revenue cycle and payment systems, according to PwC.\nProviders need to incorporate online payment sites, mobile apps and aggregated billing as steps toward a simplified consumer experience, according to the study.\nHealthcare providers who successfully transition may collect more of their patients\u2019 bills and they may collect them more quickly."}
