At stake in the caucuses are 118 delegates -- most will be divided proportionally between Sanders and Clinton.\n\n\u201cWe need real change in this country,\u201d Sanders said in Vancouver. \u201cBetween you and me, I do not believe that real change is going to come from a candidate like Sec. Clinton who receives millions of dollars from Wall Street.\u201d\n\nSanders spoke for about 45 minutes. He said the current campaign finance system is corrupt and he said the \u201ceconomy is rigged\u201d in favor of the wealthiest.\n\nSanders talked about high rates of student debt and the need for affordable college. He said he would make public universities and colleges free and pay for it by taxing Wall Street banks and financial institutions.\n\nThe Vancouver rally was a largely young crowd, including many people from the Portland metro area. Sanders said his campaign is doing well with young people, but acknowledged that it\u2019s struggling with older voters.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re working on it,\u201d Sanders said. He also said he\u2019s listening to Latino, Native American and African American communities.\n\n\u201cAnyone who has read five minutes of American history understands how shamefully and dishonorably we have treated the first Americans,\u201d he said.\n\nSanders also spoke about the need for immigration reform. And he said the African American community is tired of seeing its communities suffer from what he called inferior schools, high unemployment and \u201cseeing our jails filled with young African Americans.\u201d\n\nSanders said the Affordable Care Act is a good start, but that more needs to be done to address healthcare.\n\nHe got his largest cheers in Vancouver when he called for a single-payer healthcare system.\n\nSanders held other rallies in Seattle and Spokane. Most who came to hear him in Vancouver said they already support him, but few were less certain.\n\n\u201cI know what I\u2019m not going to do. I just haven\u2019t decided what I\u2019m going to do,\u201d said Ghlena Easterly, an Independent voter from Portland who says her biggest frustration is with Congress.\n\n\"I\u2019m not going to vote Republican,\u201d Easterly said. \"That\u2019s for sure on any of those candidates. So we\u2019re down to Hilary and Bernie so I\u2019m having a closer look at him.\u201d\n\nVancouver resident John Nugent, a Democrat, said he supports Sanders and plans to caucus for him.\n\n\u201cRepublicans are eager to fight wars around the world and spend billions of dollars on that, but I think the middle class in this country has been screwed by that whole process,\u201d he said. \u201cWe deserve something for our tax dollars and he\u2019s going to give it to us.\u201d\n\nNugent said Clinton has too much \u201cbaggage,\u201d but he\u2019d support her if she becomes the nominee.\n\nLiying Zheng and her 14-year-old son Jason Kowalski live in Camas, Washington.\n\n\u201cHe is making Hilary face her inconsistencies in the past. And even though I don\u2019t really have that much hope for him winning I think that he\u2019s bringing a lot of positive things to this election,\u201d said Kowalski.\n\nZheng immigrated to the U.S. from China.\n\nShe\u2019s had many opportunities to become a citizen, but so far she hasn\u2019t. But Zheng said this election cycle makes her want to have a voice in the process.\n\n\u201cI have never really been involved in politics,\u201d she said. \"This is the first time I\u2019ve come out to an event like this and I feel like the enthusiasm and the energy coming from the people it\u2019s just so very touching and moving.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s that enthusiasm Sanders hopes he\u2019ll be able to harness and carry to a win in Saturday\u2019s caucuses.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"category": "Northwest News", "description": "Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders campaigned in Washington state Sunday, making his first stop in Vancouver.
