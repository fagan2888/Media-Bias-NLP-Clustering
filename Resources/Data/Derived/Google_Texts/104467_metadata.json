Americans for Prosperity alone has run $5.5 million in television advertising against the law over the past three months.\n\nTim Phillips, president of Americans for Prosperity, said in an interview last week that his group\u2019s goal is not to defund the law, but to have it repealed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMr. Ellender\u2019s letter said Mr. Reid falsely \u201cclaimed yesterday that Koch was behind the shutdown of the federal government in an effort to defund the Affordable Care Act, or \u2018Obamacare.\u2019 \u201d He said that he wanted to set the record straight about what the company and its founders believe.\n\n\u201cKoch has focused on educating the public about reducing our nation\u2019s debt and controlling runaway government spending,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Ellender wrote. \u201cWe believe that Congress should, at a minimum, keep to sequester-level spending guidelines and develop a plan for more significant and widespread spending reductions in the future. We also believe that Congress should work to rein in rampant government spending so that it becomes no longer necessary to continually raise the debt ceiling.\u2019\u2019\n\nWhile Freedom Partners, whose board is headed by a longtime executive of Koch Industries, has financed organizations that are pushing to defund the law, like Heritage Action and Tea Party Patriots, Freedom Partners has not advocated that. A spokesman for the group, James Davis, said it was more focused on \u201ceducating Americans around the country on the negative impacts of Obamacare.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20131009111550, "BN": "fiscal-crisis", "DISPLAYDATE": "October 9, 2013", "keywords": "Uncategorized", "PT": "Blogs", "author": "Sheryl Gay Stolberg", "SCG": "fiscal-crisis", "sourceApp": "blogs", "CLMST": "Sheryl Gay Stolberg", "byl": "Sheryl Gay Stolberg", "twitter": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/news/fiscal-crisis/2013/10/09/kochs-deny-pushing-for-shutdown-over-health-law/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "description": "Koch Industries accused the Senate majority leader of spreading \u201cfalse information\u201d about the brothers by suggesting they are behind the move to end financing for President Obama\u2019s healthcare law and the partial shutdown of the federal government.", "card": "summary", "title": "Kochs Deny Pushing for Shutdown Over Health Law"}, "adxPage": "blog.nytimes.com/fiscal-crisis/post", "description": "Koch Industries accused the Senate majority leader of spreading \u201cfalse information\u201d about the brothers by suggesting they are behind the move to end financing for President Obama\u2019s healthcare law and the partial shutdown of the federal government.", "CG": "U.S.", "robots": "noodp", "dat": "October 9, 2013", "article": {"section": "U.S.", "tag": "Uncategorized", "published_time": 1381331750, "collection": "http://json8.nytimes.com/services/json/sectionfronts/us/index.jsonp", "modified_time": "2013-10-09T16:55:00-04:00"}, "utime": 20131009165500, "PUD": 20131009, "pdate": 20131009, "thumbnail": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/news/fiscal-crisis/2013/10/09/kochs-deny-pushing-for-shutdown-over-health-law/", "site_name": "Fiscal Crisis", "type": "article", "description": "Koch Industries accused the Senate majority leader of spreading \u201cfalse information\u201d about the brothers by suggesting they are behind the move to end financing for President Obama\u2019s healthcare law and the partial shutdown of the federal government.", "title": "Kochs Deny Pushing for Shutdown Over Health Law"}, "PUV": "normal", "hdl": "Kochs Deny Pushing for Shutdown Over Health Law", "thumbnail_150": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "PST": "Blog Post"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe165f\"", "article_summary": "Americans for Prosperity alone has run $5.5 million in television advertising against the law over the past three months.\n\u201cKoch has focused on educating the public about reducing our nation\u2019s debt and controlling runaway government spending,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Ellender wrote.\nA spokesman for the group, James Davis, said it was more focused on \u201ceducating Americans around the country on the negative impacts of Obamacare.\u201d\nTim Phillips, president of Americans for Prosperity, said in an interview last week that his group\u2019s goal is not to defund the law, but to have it repealed.\n\u201cKoch believes that Obamacare will increase deficits, lead to an overall lowering of the standard of health care and raise taxes,\u2019\u2019 Philip Ellender, the company\u2019s chief spokesman, wrote in a letter to senators."}
