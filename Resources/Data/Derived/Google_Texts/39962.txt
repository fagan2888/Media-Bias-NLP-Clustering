KENTWOOD, MI – Autocam Medical LLC, has won a federal court ruling that declared it does not have to comply with the Affordable Care Act’s so-called “abortion pill mandate” as part of its employee health care coverage.

The ruling by U.S. District Judge Robert J. Jonker falls in line with last summer’s U.S. Supreme Court landmark ruling in which Hobby Lobby won its appeal against the Affordable Care Act.

Like Autocam, Hobby Lobby challenged the law’s requirement that employers provide coverage for “contraceptive methods, sterilization procedures, and related patient education and counseling to which plaintiff objects on religious grounds.”
