In order to improve the Georgia SHBP\u2019s relative position in overall cost share, the Georgia SHBP might consider making the plans offered more affordable through lower employee payroll deduction requirements and/or lower expected OOP (out-of-pocket) costs.\u201d\n\nReducing payroll deduction requirements \u2013 how much employees have to pay for premiums \u2013 or out-of-pocket costs could, without altering the coverage, mean the state and/or school districts would have to pick up more of the tab. Which is not what the state lawmakers who asked for the study probably wanted to hear.\n\nOn the other hand, the study really wasn\u2019t news to the teachers and state employees paying the premiums, particularly members of TRAGIC, a group originally formed to fight cutbacks in benefits and a big increase in out-of-pocket expenses.\n\n\u201cThis report confirms what the teachers and state employees of TRAGIC have been saying since January, 2014: our insurance options are unaffordable and we pay higher premiums and out-of-pocket costs than comparable plans in other states,\u201d said John Palmer, a Cobb County school band director and TRAGIC spokesman. \u201cThe question is, what is the Legislature willing to do to help the citizens who work for state of Georgia?\u201d\n\nAon Hewitt also looked at coverage for non-certified school employees \u2013 accountants, bus drivers, etc. It found that the \u201cemployer contributions\u201d \u2013 payments by the state or local school districts \u2013 are insufficient to fund the coverage.\n\nState budget officials have long said that teachers, state employees and retirees are subsidizing coverage for non-certified employees by paying higher-than-necessary premiums.\n\nGov. Nathan Deal and lawmakers pushed about $100 million more of the cost to cover bus drivers and cafeteria workers onto school districts this year, arguing that the state doesn\u2019t subsidize health care for part-time government workers. The exception is legislators themselves, who are part-time and yet covered under the State Health Benefit Plan.\n\nSome TRAGIC members are concerned that the next step by Deal and lawmakers will be to force school districts to cover the full cost of health insurance for thousands of non-certified employees. That would cost school districts tens of millions, if not hundreds of millions of dollars a year more for health coverage.\n\nAon Hewitt suggested two ways to bring down the costs for the non-certified employees: force them to pay much more for their coverage, or design a new plan with fewer health benefits.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "The Watchdog blog", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"url": "http://investigations.blog.ajc.com/2015/07/03/georgia-teachers-employees-carrying-big-load-on-health-care-study-finds/", "image": "https://cmgajcinvestigations.files.wordpress.com/2015/07/tragic-photo.jpg?w=300", "type": "article", "description": "A new Department of Community Health study tells 650,000 teachers, state employees and retirees something they'd probably already guessed: that their medical coverage cost them more than workers covered by similar government programs in Georgia and nearby states.\r\n\r\nThe report, requested by state lawmakers, looked at why the $3 billion State Health Benefit Plan costs so much.\r\n\r\n Supporters of T.R.A.G.I.C.
