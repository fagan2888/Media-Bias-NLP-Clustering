Mothers have long counseled their young daughters to ignore the tricks of teenage boys because girls are far more levelheaded anyway.

As per scientists, brains undergo major reform thereby reducing the connections in the brain as we grow older. The re-organization begins earlier in girls when they are passing through teenage.

Dr. Marcus Kaiser and Sol Lim from Newcastle University found that generally connections in the brain get streamlined. But, long-distance connections that are vital for combining information are preserved.

The Newcastle University researchers said this could help clarify why teenage girls appear to grow up faster as compared to their male classmates.

The researchers at Newcastle, Glasgow and Seoul Universities studied the scans of 121 healthy participants. These participants were belonging to an age group of 4 years to 40 years. During this phase of life, the major connectivity changes can be observed as this is period of maturation and improvement in the brain.

The study is part of the EPSRC-funded Human Green Brain project which examines human brain development. The findings are set to be published in the Cerebral Cortex.

Researcher Sol Lim said that the loss of connectivity during brain development can essentially assist to improve brain function by rearranging the network more efficiently.
