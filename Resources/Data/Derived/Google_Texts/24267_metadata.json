If you answered \u201cdivorce\u201d or \u201closing my husband,\u201d you\u2019re probably wrong \u2014 at least as far as future happiness is concerned. Don\u2019t get me wrong: these things will make you very unhappy. (To say nothing of how your husband will feel.) But over time, research shows, you will recover.\n\nNot so with unemployment. Like divorce or the death of a spouse, losing a job will often plunge people into despair. But,unless they spend a lot of time hunting for a new job, unemployed people tend to stay unemployed. Time heals most wounds, but not all of them. A long-term study of how Germans reacted to various life events showed that four years after they\u2019d lost their jobs, they still hadn\u2019t gotten used to it \u2014 being unemployed made them just as unhappy as they\u2019d been the day they were laid off.\n\n\n\nRemember, this is Germany, which long had generous unemployment benefits. The financial insecurity that usually attends prolonged unemployment is bound to add to one\u2019s misery. But it doesn\u2019t seem to be the primary cause. As much as we may gripe about it, work is not just something you have to do in order to pay the mortgage. It is a daily connection to coworkers and customers. It is the knowledge that you are wanted and useful. Even the most tedious job gives us a place in the world. Unemployment makes us question why we are here.\n\nThat\u2019s what is so disturbing about the recent string of lackluster job reports. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported last week that in January, 145.2 million people were employed \u2014 1.1 million fewer than in January of 2008, even though the population has grown. In the last two months, the economy created fewer than 200,000 jobs. The unemployment rate is falling only because so many people have dropped out of the labor force entirely and stopped looking.\n\n\u201cIf you want to work, if you want a job, if you want to be part of America, we\u2019ll find a place for you,\u201d Senator Rand Paul recently promised immigrants. But right now, America can\u2019t even do this for the people who are already here. The administration often seems to be focused on making unemployment more attractive, rather than making it less common, fighting Republicans over extended unemployment benefits (which some research indicates may actually increase unemployment), and not talking much about how to get people back to work. When the Congressional Budget Office recently projected that Obamacare would cause the economy to lose the equivalent of 2 million full time jobs, the White House argued that this was actually great news, because most of them would be choosing not to work.\n\nNever mind that many of them would be \u201cchoosing\u201d unemployment because Obamcare\u2019s subsidy structure effectively makes much work unprofitable. Work is a form of investment: in many careers, pay and promotion opportunities are strongly related to the number of you\u2019ve worked (and experience you\u2019ve accumulated).\n\nThat\u2019s if you can get a job at all. But one thing we know about today\u2019s labor market is that once you\u2019ve left, it\u2019s very hard to get back in. Public outcry may be stopping employers from posting the \u201cno unemployed need apply\u201d ads that triggered such outrage a few years ago, but studies show that their behavior hasn\u2019t actually changed: people whose resumes have a sizeable gap will have a substantially harder time finding another job. That\u2019s true for laid off ironworkers and middle managers, and it\u2019s also true for women who step out of the workforce to care for a family member. You can argue \u2014 as I would \u2014 that employers shouldn\u2019t do this, but no one\u2019s come up with a way to stop them. That\u2019s why our government policy ought to be focused on keeping people at work, not making it easier for them to leave.\n\nThis is difficult, but not impossible. There are programs, from tax credits for hiring the unemployed to using direct employment programs as a substitute for extended unemployment benefits. None of them seems likely in the current political environment, so Americans who\u2019ve lost their jobs are going to have to help themselves. Fortunately, we do know something about what works, and what doesn\u2019t.\n\nThe first thing is pretty obvious: you have to look for work, every day. Research shows that the more time you spend on your job search, the more likely you are to find another job quickly. Interestingly, how you go about looking seems to matter less than the amount of time you spend doing it.\n\nThe second is to be willing to accept lower pay. In the current labor market, you are much better off looking for a higher-paying job from a lower-paying job, than from no job at all.\n\nAnd the third is move. The whole country has been hit hard by the recession, but some areas were harder hit than others. The farther you are willing to move, the more likely you are to find a job that fits your skills.\n\n\u201cBut that\u2019s obvious!\u201d you may be saying, and it\u2019s true. But you wouldn\u2019t know it from the behavior of job seekers. Many of whom slack off their job search when their first round of leads run dry, and resist taking a lower-paying jobs, especially if it involves moving far away. This is entirely understandable. Job hunting, with all its explicit and implicit rejection, is extremely unpleasant. I know, I\u2019ve been there. So is accepting that you are no longer worth what your last boss paid you. And moving routinely ranks high on the list of life\u2019s most unpleasant experiences. But even if it\u2019s understandable, it\u2019s also terribly dangerous.\n\nIf you reconcile yourself to lower pay, and steel yourself to put in the hours and look for a job every single day \u2014 even when you don\u2019t feel like it, and even if you aren\u2019t sure you are searching the \u201cright\u201d way \u2014 then you are much more likely to keep a brief episode of misery from turning into an extended catastrophe. Unemployment will always be one of the worst things that ever happened to you, but it doesn\u2019t actually have to stay that way.\n\nMegan McArdle is a Bloomberg columnist whose recent book is The Up Side of Down: Why Failing Well is the Key to Success (Viking).", "article_metadata": {"description": "When it comes to happiness, being unemployed is worse for you than divorce or the death of a spouse.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "TIME.com", "description": "When it comes to happiness, being unemployed is worse for you than divorce or the death of a spouse.", "title": "Unemployment: A Fate Worse Than Death", "url": "http://time.com/9009/unemployment-is-worse-than-death/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/time2014/img/time-logo-og.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "TIME", "image": {"src": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/time2014/img/time-logo-og.png"}, "description": "When it comes to happiness, being unemployed is worse for you than divorce or the death of a spouse.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Unemployment: A Fate Worse Than Death"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-tooltip": "Current & Breaking News | National & World Updates", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://time.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/2cee445ea71a179ffd35ea91cf154905?s=16", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "fb": {"app_id": 53177223193}, "p": {"domain_verify": "f48a8936c3fffc943fce516f2e3ff1d2"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/time2014/img/time-touch_icon_152.png", "application-name": "TIME", "keywords": "finding a job, jobless, labor, the up side of down: why falling wellwhy failing well is the key, unemployment", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/time"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "finding a job, jobless, labor, the up side of down: why falling wellwhy failing well is the key, unemployment"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd7ef3\"", "article_summary": "But,unless they spend a lot of time hunting for a new job, unemployed people tend to stay unemployed.\nLike divorce or the death of a spouse, losing a job will often plunge people into despair.\nThe unemployment rate is falling only because so many people have dropped out of the labor force entirely and stopped looking.\nNever mind that many of them would be \u201cchoosing\u201d unemployment because Obamcare\u2019s subsidy structure effectively makes much work unprofitable.\nUnemployment will always be one of the worst things that ever happened to you, but it doesn\u2019t actually have to stay that way."}
