So while higher than last year, those by historic standards were very low increases, and we are still in a period of relatively modest increases,\u201d said John O\u2019Brien, OPM\u2019s director of health care and insurance, in a call with reporters. \u201cOne contributing factor to the somewhat higher premium increase is the uptick in the growth of drug costs. Drug costs for the FEHBP program are a much larger factor than other employer sponsored programs because annuitants, for whom drugs are a majority of the benefits are included in our FEHBP risk pool. Drugs represent nearly 27 percent of the total spend in the FEHB compared to 10 percent for a typical employer.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Brien said OPM encouraged insurance carriers in March to address the cost of prescription drugs anyway they could, including new contracts with providers and looking at more active management strategies.\n\nHe also emphasized that despite the average increase of 6.4 percent, federal employees will not see a change in their deductibles or the amount of money they have to spend on co-pays.\n\nOPM said the average costs per enrollment option:\n\nSelf only: $5.50 more per pay period\n\nSelf-plus-one: $8.92 per pay period more than they previously paid for self and family coverage.\n\nSelf and family: $19.61 more per pay period.\n\nO\u2019Brien said for the vast majority of the people who move to self-plus-one from self and family, total costs will go down. He said self-plus-one is open to any federal employee or retiree plus one other designated family member \u2014 a child or a spouse.\n\n\u201cFor over 95 percent of the enrollees [in self-plus-one option], the enrollees share, the amount of money the person pays out of pocket for insurance coverage, will be lower for the than the enrollees share for self and family in their current plan,\u201d he said. \u201cHowever, it is possible that in some plans, there will be a higher enrollee share for self-plus-one enrollment than for self and family enrollment. Therefore, OPM is encouraging enrollees to shop carefully before making a change. Switching to self-plus-one is voluntary. If someone is better off staying self and family coverage they are absolutely not only allowed to do so, but encouraged to do so.\u201d\n\nOPM released details of the rates for next year for all plans for U.S. Postal Service and non-USPS employees.\n\nOPM finalized the self-plus one option in September in preparation for open season.\n\nHealth insurance providers have increased rates for each of the past three years, including 3.2 percent in 2015, 3.7 percent in 2014 and 3.4 percent in 2013.\n\nRichard Thissen, president of the National Active and Retired Federal Employees Association (NARFE), released a statement saying the increase could mean reduced take-home pay for federal employees who had been expecting a 1.3 percent pay raise in 2016.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, federal retirees are facing an even worse situation,\u201d Thissen said. \u201cNot only are their health insurance premiums increasing by 7.4 percent, it is unlikely they will receive a cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) to their annuities next year. Additionally, many federal retirees are facing a more than 50 percent increase in their Medicare premiums, further diminishing their ability to make ends meet. In a year in which health insurance costs are increasing substantially, we can clearly see a need for a new formula to calculate COLAs, one that accurately reflects the health care costs of our nation\u2019s seniors.\u201d\n\nThissen added that families switching from self-and-family to self-plus-one could save an average of $278 next year.\n\n\u201cHowever, as compared to their 2015 Self and Family premiums, they will see an average premium increase of about $232 for the year due to the overall increases in premiums,\u201d he said. \u201cThat, of course, is preferable to the $510 average premium increase for Self and Family premiums for the year.\u201d\n\nEven with this significant increase for 2016, it pales in comparison to what feds saw in the 2000s. OPM has said previously that in the early 2000s, premiums increased on average by 10 percent to 12 percent annually.\n\nO\u2019Brien said OPM looked at several independent assessments of health care for the private sector and rate increases ranged from 4 percent to more than 7 percent, meaning changes to the FEHB program are in the range of other programs.\n\nIn addition to health care plan increases, federal employees also will see increases in their dental and vision insurance premiums.\n\nOPM said the average dental plan will increase by 2.23 percent, while the average vision plan will go up by 3.1 percent in 2016.\n\nOPM said 1.6 million employees have dental plans and 1.1 million feds have vision plans.\n\nThe American Federation of Government Employees said the increase inrates is unacceptable.\n\n\u201cThe government is shifting more of the cost increase to enrollees, further eating away at their take-home pay,\u201d said AFGE National President J. David Cox, in a release. \u201cOur members take home an average of $500 a week. This is a significant and unfortunate cost that is being passed on to them at a time when they can least afford it.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "http://federalnewsradio.com/wp-content/plugins/sailthru-custom/assets/img/wtop50x50.jpg", "news_keywords": "federal employee health benefit program, opm, pay and benefits, self-plus-one option", "application-name": "FederalNewsRadio.com", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://federalnewsradio.com/wp-content/themes/wfed/assets/img/favicons/mstile-310x150.png", "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://federalnewsradio.com/wp-content/themes/wfed/assets/img/favicons/mstile-70x70.png", "og": {"site_name": "FederalNewsRadio.com", "description": "The Office of Personnel Management released the FEHBP rates today for 2016, detailing the largest health care increase in recent memory.", "title": "Feds' health care costs to increase on average by 6.4 percent", "locale": "en_US", "updated_time": "2015-09-30T09:02:19+00:00", "url": "http://federalnewsradio.com/benefits/2015/09/feds-health-care-costs-increase-average-6-4-percent/", "type": "article"}, "sailthru.image.full": "http://federalnewsradio.com/wp-content/plugins/sailthru-custom/assets/img/wtop50x50.jpg", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://federalnewsradio.com/wp-content/themes/wfed/assets/img/favicons/mstile-310x310.png", "wp-parsely_version": "1.7", "sailthru.canonical": "http://federalnewsradio.com/benefits/2015/09/feds-health-care-costs-increase-average-6-4-percent/", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://federalnewsradio.com/wp-content/themes/wfed/assets/img/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "article": {"section": "All News", "tag": "Federal Employee Health Benefit Program,OPM,pay and benefits,Self-plus-one option", "published_time": "2015-09-29T11:43:47+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-09-30T09:02:19+00:00"}, "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://federalnewsradio.com/wp-content/themes/wfed/assets/img/favicons/mstile-150x150.png", "sailthru.date": "2015-09-29 11:43:47", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "The Office of Personnel Management released the FEHBP rates today for 2016, detailing the largest health care increase in recent memory."}, "article_summary": "Jason Miller, Executive Editor, Federal News Radio http://federalnewsradio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/0930-ID-miller-WEB.mp3Federal employees on average will pay 6.4 percent more for health care in 2016.\nIn addition to health care plan increases, federal employees also will see increases in their dental and vision insurance premiums.\nHe also emphasized that despite the average increase of 6.4 percent, federal employees will not see a change in their deductibles or the amount of money they have to spend on co-pays.\n\u201cNot only are their health insurance premiums increasing by 7.4 percent, it is unlikely they will receive a cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) to their annuities next year.\nHealth insurance providers have increased rates for each of the past three years, including 3.2 percent in 2015, 3.7 percent in 2014 and 3.4 percent in 2013."}
