We then determine how much bonds we want to issue out of this money.\u201d\n\nBonds are used to fund capital projects in advance, meaning officials do not have to wait for taxes to roll in before beginning projects. When they do receive the sales tax receipts, the funding is used to pay back the bond.\n\n\u201cYou have that ability, if you put it in the referendum that you\u2019re going to issue bonds,\u201d Lovett said. \u201c...You can get money up front that will help you get those projects underway.\u201d\n\nHall Superintendent Will Schofield said he expects the tax, if passed by voters, will generate between $25 and $35 million per year over five years for the three systems.\n\n\u201cEverybody has to come up with a separate list,\u201d said Lovett, who estimates Hall\u2019s list will be complete by the end of the month. \u201c...We need to do that very soon, and then when our attorney gets all of that, he\u2019ll draft a referendum, resolutions, notice of election and all the other things that go with that.\u201d\n\nThe current E-SPLOST ends in September 2017 and will generate about $100 million for the county school district, according to Schofield.\n\nAt Hall\u2019s school board work session Monday night, Schofield and the board reviewed the projects already funded by E-SPLOST over the years, including the purchase of 802 acres for 10 new facilities, 23 additions to existing facilities and an additional 1.5 million square feet of space.\n\nAaron Turpin, Hall\u2019s executive director for technology, said the district is developing a website to share the results of E-SPLOST and remind the public what the tax receipts can and cannot be used for, as the funds can only be used for capital improvements.\n\n\u201cThis penny spent going on \u2014 what would it be now, 18 years? It has allowed us to become debt-free, and it has allowed us to build 10 new schools,\u201d Schofield said. \u201cIt\u2019s the first time in 50 years we\u2019ve been debt-free, so I think it\u2019s been a wonderful investment in technology and infrastructure.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.gainesvilletimes.com/archives/110736/", "image": "http://media.morristechnology.com/webmedia/facebook_share_images/gainesville/020216thetimesogimgoptimzed.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Hall County school leaders are finalizing a list of projects that could be funded by a sales tax up for a vote in November.", "title": "Hall County school board prepares for fall E-SPLOST referendum"}, "twitter": {"site": "@gtimes", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive", "title": "Hall County school board prepares for fall E-SPLOST referendum"}, "article_summary": "The E-SPLOST referendum on the ballot Nov. 3 involves three school systems: Gainesville City Schools, Buford City Schools and the Hall County School District, according to Hall Deputy Superintendent Lee Lovett.\nHall County school leaders are finalizing a list of projects that could be funded by a sales tax up for a vote in November.\nIt has allowed us to become debt-free, and it has allowed us to build 10 new schools,\u201d Schofield said.\nCurrently, the special purpose local option sales tax for education puts a penny of every dollar spent in Hall County toward local school systems\u2019 capital projects, including new buildings, renovations, equipment and land.\n\u201cYou have that ability, if you put it in the referendum that you\u2019re going to issue bonds,\u201d Lovett said."}
