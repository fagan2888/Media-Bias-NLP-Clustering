Lubbock’s economy in 2015 ended with growth, according to the Economic Index that had an increase in December of 3.0 percent to 147.7, compared to December 2014’s 143.3

The December increase marks the 10th straight month of improvement, according to Lubbock National Bank, which maintains the monthly index. December’s 147.7 index is also up from November’s 147.5.

“We finished 2015 in great shape,” said Chip Gilmour, Lubbock National Bank senior vice president. “We’ve had a great year economically speaking here in Lubbock and it still looks like there is nothing out there that is going to change the direction we’ve enjoyed the last several months.”

The index also increased at an annualized rate of 2.3 percent in the fourth quarter of 2015.

Record building permit activity in December pushed the index upward for the month and the year. Home sales in 2015 were also the highest on record, as were December totals.

Construction

About $664 million in building permits were issued in 2015 that outpaced the 2014 permit valuation of about $508 million, which previously held the record in permits sold.

“Construction has been excellent this year,” Gilmour said. “Construction permits for the year was up 30.6 percent and that’s an extremely healthy number.”

Construction permits were up 48 percent for the quarter, compared to the fourth quarter in 2014.

December had an 84.4 percent increase in construction permit valuation compared to December 2014.

Homes

Compared to 2014, the housing market did well in terms of number of permits. Home permits were up 9 percent in 2015.

The fourth-quarter permit total was up 12 percent compared to the 2014 fourth quarter.

December outpaced the same month in 2014 new housing permits, Gilmour said.

“New home permits for the month of December were up 56.3 percent,” he said. “That’s a huge percentage increase.”

The 50 permits issued in December is the highest December monthly total since 2009.

Unemployment

December unemployment ended at 3.1 percent, and the annual average was at 3.4 percent.

“If you want a job, Lubbock is a great place to be,” Gilmour said.

Lubbock sits with the third-lowest metro area unemployment rate in the state, just behind Amarillo and Austin-Round Rock.

The national unemployment rate is at 4.9 percent, Gilmour said.

“That is the lowest that it’s been in about eight years,” he said.

Auto sales

Automobile sales slowed down in 2015 after an impressive 13 percent in sales growth in 2014, compared to 2013.

Spending on automobiles were down 3.1 percent in 2015, compared to the 2014 annual total.

But real auto sales activity in 2015 was the second highest on record with $805 million, right behind 2014’s $826 million.

December auto sales were down 12.5 percent compared to December 2014.

Retail sales

Retail sales ended the year with a 1.5 percent growth for the year, Gilmour said.

December’s sales tax receipts were down 8 percent, compared to December 2014.

About $2.9 billion was spent in retail sales in 2015, and about $2.8 billion in 2014.

Oil prices

Oil ended the year at $33 a barrel compared to $55 a barrel in 2014 — a 39 percent drop.

In December, the rig count was about 14 — about a 55 percent decrease from 2014’s 31.

Agriculture

Cotton prices in December were up about 1.5 percent, compared to December 2014, which had prices at $58.78. November 2015 had prices at $59.64 per pound.
