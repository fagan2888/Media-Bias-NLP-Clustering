The ad features John\u2019s family, including his wife of 24 years, Lori; his daughters Gabby, 17, Sam, 22, and Maddie, 14; and his son Johnny, 20, literally inviting viewers into meeting his family. A plus effort.\n\nIn the ad, Kane says he is running for State Senate to \u201cput back the $1 billion Corbett cut from education and make sure corporations and natural-gas drillers pay their fair share.\u201d Kane goes on to say, \u201cIt\u2019s time to close to loopholes for the tax cheats.\u201d\n\nThe ad can be viewed at: http://youtube/J4E16ur54ds.\n\n\u201cI am incredibly proud of this ad, and so happy that my family was able to join me in making it,\u201d said Kane. \u201cAs I cross the district, knocking on doors and talking to voters, I hear over and over again that people are angry that their schools are not getting the funding they need and their property taxes are going up, while corporations and shale drillers are getting sweetheart deals.\u201d\n\nKane is the Democrat running for State Senate in the 26th Dist. that lies in Delaware and Chester Cos. His opponent is Tom McGarrigle, County Council Chairman. The 26th Dist. is viewed as the most-competitive legislative race in Pennsylvania this year. The seat is held by Republican State Sen. Edwin \u201cTed Erickson\u201d who is retiring.\n\nHUMANE SOCIETY PUTS $$$ BEHIND FITZPATRICK\n\nThe Humane Society Legislative Fund, the nation\u2019s leading political advocacy organization for animal welfare, has endorsed Congressman Mike Fitzpatrick (R-Bucks) for reelection in the 8th Dist. It cited his strong leadership and advocacy on animal-protection policies.\n\nNow if pet owners come out in response to the Society\u2019s call, Mike will do well.\n\nThe HSLF publishes an annual Humane Scorecard of Congress to give voters a snapshot of every federal legislator\u2019s record on animal-protection issues. Three times Fitzpatrick achieved a perfect score of 100 for votes in favor of animal-welfare measures before the US House.\n\nWHEN ALL POLLS SAY THE SAME THING\n\nRobert Morris University reports a new finding that confirms other bad-news polls for Gov. Tom Corbett. Although the election-day poll is the final poll, it is hard to continue to ignore polls when they all point in the same direction. The F&M poll wasn\u2019t a \u201cjunk poll\u201d as Team Corbett claimed, and a whole summer\u2019s worth of attack ads haven\u2019t bought the Republican Governor a better shot in November. National Journal is calling this race a \u201cnear-automatic pickup\u201d for Democrats.\n\nEven GOP firm Harper Polling says Democrat Tom Wolf holds an 11% lead over Republican Gov. Tom Corbett among Pennsylvania likely voters, giving voters a feeling he is the winner. It shows Wolf holds a comfortable lead (58-35%) in the Southeastern region, the race is a draw in the South Central (48% Corbett, 45% Wolf) and the Southwest (48% Wolf, 46% Corbett) regions. Sixty-one percent said, regardless of personal preference, they expect Wolf to win the November election, compared to 33% who expect Corbett to win. The polling memo says 8% of Corbett voters are supporting the Governor, despite expecting him to lose.\n\n26th Ward GOP leader Jim Dintino wonders why Corbett\u2019s campaign hasn\u2019t played up his differences with President Obama, whose polls show he has no coattails for Dem candidates to hang onto. He cited Jul. 1, 2014 when income, payroll, capital gains, dividend, and estate taxes went up under the Affordable Care Act. He advises, \u201cNot one Republican voted for these taxes.\u201d This could be an ace up Corbett\u2019s sleeve; but he must play it, not leave voters to guess at it, if he wants to reverse polling trends.\n\nPHILLY CIGARETTE-TAX PASSAGE IS PRIORITY\n\nThe number-one priority for House Democrats when they return to voting session will be the swift passage of legislation authorizing a $2-per-pack cigarette tax for Philadelphia, which will go to help fund the Philadelphia School District.\n\n\u201cThe most-important thing when we go back is making sure we get the Philly cigarette tax done so the next school year the School District can maintain what they have and keep people working,\u201d said House Minority Leader Frank Dermody (D-Allegheny).\n\n\u201cAllegheny Co. was interested in looking at having that opportunity,\u201d he said of a cigarette tax. \u201cRight now, I think it\u2019s important for us to take care of Philadelphia schools.\u201d\n\nHe said extending the tax to other counties is a much larger issue better left for another day.\n\nCHARTER VS. PUBLIC-SCHOOL LIMITS ON S.C. AGENDA\n\nThe Pennsylvania Supreme Court heard oral arguments this week in a case challenging Philadelphia School District\u2019s decision to place limits on charter-school enrollment.\n\nThe School Reform Commission, a state-appointed body that runs the School District, set the enrollment limits in August of last year as part of a series of cost-saving measures that required the suspension of certain parts of the state\u2019s public-school code. The West Philadelphia Achievement Charter ES filed a lawsuit in March challenging the enrollment limits.\n\nBRAVO JOE HOEFFEL, NOW AN AUTHOR\n\nFormer Congressman Joe Hoeffel, immersed in politics for three decades, is how signing copies of his book, The Iraq Lie: How White House Sold The War.\n\nHe\u2019ll be signing books at Abington Township Public Library, 2-4 p.m., this Sunday, with net proceeds going to the library, which is located at 1030 Old York Road in Abington.\n\nELLA BUTCHER WILL RUN AS G.O.P. COMMISSIONER\n\nElla Butcher, noted 36th Ward Republican activist, has revealed she will be among those seeking nomination for City Commissioner in the Republican primary.\n\nShe has a series of legislative amendments which she feels can become law if she promoted them from that position. Her group reported a host of irregularities in past elections, for which she found no existing legislation to curb those practices.\n\nAnother Republican seeking a seat is John Featherman, who was reported in local media as eyeing the GOP nomination for Mayor. He intends to run for it, should he not receive party endorsement.\n\nDAILY NEWS SAYS NO TO 2ND CASINO\n\nSupposedly worried over the impact another casino will have over the one now in existent because of casino closings in Atlantic City, the Philadelphia Daily News editorialized the Gaming Commission should not aware the second casino to Philadelphia.\n\nLook at plans for one of the four bidders, Casino Revolution. It proposes to create a true entertainment revolution, turning no-use land in South Philadelphia into another Disney-type casino-hotel-golf course and amusement-park complex, providing hundreds of jobs six months earlier than any of the other casino applicants \u2013 just what Philly needs! Look at the taxes we have been losing without a second casino in operation!\n\nSo a dunce cap for the editorial department at the News for trying to protect the sandbox casino at Delaware & Frankford Avenues.\n\nBROWNLEE GIFTS STUDENTS WITH SCHOOL BAGS, SUPPLIES\n\nState Rep. Michelle Brownlee (D-N. Phila.), as others in the Democratic Caucus from Philly have done, distributed state-related materials and free bookbags with school supplies at five locations in her district on one day last Friday.\n\nShe also advised constituents not to expect legislative reports in the mail because of House rules that prevent the material going out for the next two months until election day. So we suggest you check here periodically. She is responsible for a great many benefits going to her district.\n\nREPUBLICANS AT PHILLIES FUNDRAISER TONIGHT\n\nRick Heilberg believes the Phillies are plying their best, with new faces, and are exciting to watch. Which is why he states GOP Night this evening at the Phillies will draw many of the Republican faithful to this party fundraiser. Chairman John Taylor will be present from 5:30 p.m. on, at the rooftop in right field. Pregame party costs $65. Ticket for game are $38 or $20. For tickets call (215) 561-0650 or Rick at (610) 585-6789.\n\nPA. SUPREME COURT TO RULE ON 8-YEAR VOTING CASE\n\nA little over eight years ago, Pennsylvania Secretary of State Pedro Cort\u00e9s found himself being sued to prevent counties from using electronic voting machines. Those suing said the machines do \u201cnot create a permanent record of each vote\u201d and violates the Pennsylvania Election Code, as well as the Pennsylvania Constitution. A few months later, a divided Commonwealth Court rejected efforts by the Dept. of State to dismiss the legal challenge against touch-screen voting machines.\n\nThe Secretary of State appealed that decision to the State Supreme Court, but in late 2008, Pennsylvania\u2019s high court denied that appeal, allowing the lawsuit to be considered by Commonwealth Court. A little more than two years ago, Commonwealth Court rejected several of the lawsuits\u2019 claims. That ruling prompted an appeal to the State Supreme Court, with the State\u2019s high court in late July agreeing to hear oral arguments.\n\nThe big question, if SC rules electronic voting no longer legal: Who pays the millions needed to replace them, and with what? Paper ballots?\n\nFUMO BACK AS ADVISER TO TERMINAL OPERATOR\n\nKudos to former State Sen. Vincent Fumo, now working with major Port Terminal operator John Brown, Jr., as an advisor. Fumo\u2019s services will come in handy especially now that Southport, the proposed new port terminal on an old Navy Yard site, is up for dibs with the Philadelphia Regional Port Authority studying whom best to lease the terminal to.\n\nNO RESPECT FOR EX-CONS AS WORKING PA. LOBBYISTS\n\nMontgomery Co. lawyer Mark Schwartz is urging members of the General Assembly to support legislation banning ex-felons from becoming lobbyists. Schwartz cites a number of them. Is he worried about competition?\n\nNo Pennsylvania law prohibits ex-legislators or their aides from lobbying, which offers a median salary in Pennsylvania of about $100,000 a year, according to human-resources data and those in the industry.\n\nSchwartz is a former aide to the late Democratic Speaker K. Leroy Irvis of Pittsburgh.\n\nPETTIGREW HOSTS DAUGHTER\u2019S CHAMPAGNE SENDOFF\n\nGOP Ward Leader Bill Pettigrew and wife Debbie are inviting friends to a champagne sendoff for the wedding of their daughter Nicole Pettigrew to John Stalmaster at Quaker City Yacht Club, 7101 N. Delaware Avenue. The event is Sep. 20 at 6 p.m. If you received an invite you need to RSVP at (215) 743-2000 ASAP. The couple will wed on Oct. 4.\n\nNOW IF FATTAH AND JAMES WERE IN A DEMOCRATIC PRIMARY\u2026.\n\nRepublican 2nd Congressional Dist. candidate Armond James is finding out he is getting some traction in his challenge to Congressman Chaka Fattah. If he had some big donors, he could possibly make a difference in the general-election outcome. More voters are learning he is a Temple grad who has been mentoring at-risk children at an advocacy program for some time now.\n\nRCC Exec. Dir. Joe DeFelice ponders the question, \u201cHad this been a Democrat primary, would James upset Fattah as did Fattah in his uphill victory in the 1994 primary over Lucien Blackwell?\u201d\n\nSEN. TOOMEY VISITS ALL 67 PENNA. COUNTIES AGAIN\n\nUS Sen. Pat Toomey (R-Pa.), who understands \u201call politics is local\u201d, has visited all 67 Pennsylvania counties during the 113th Congress which began in January 2013. The Senator accomplished this goal during the previous Congress as well.\n\n\u201cSince joining the Senate, I have made it a priority to visit each county of our great Commonwealth every Congress,\u201d said Toomey. \u201cPennsylvania is a beautiful state full of history, culture, and most importantly good, hard-working people. After speaking with thousands of people from Pike Co. to Greene Co., and everywhere in between, it\u2019s clear to me Pennsylvanians are worried about our sluggish economy, unemployment, and a federal government that lives beyond its means. They\u2019re concerned about their jobs being threatened by red tape and rising taxes. I am pleased to have heard from so many Pennsylvanians and pledge to continue my efforts to fight for you in Washington.\u201d\n\nHe understands working every day as though it were election day, makes it easier to win next time around.\n\nJOIN OUR NEWSPAPER Join over 3.000 visitors who are receiving our newsletter and learn how to optimize your blog for search engines, find free traffic, and monetize your website.
