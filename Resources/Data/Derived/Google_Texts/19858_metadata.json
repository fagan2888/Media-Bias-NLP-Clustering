It represents a kind of final victory for mean-spirited and uncharitable propaganda over reality, a triumph for misinformation, sabotage, and arrant bullshit in the service of a cruel ideology and faceless oligarchy. It is a measure of the failure of all of our institutions, which definitely includes my own, which allowed charlatans and frauds to hijack too much of the public debate. I pray for this woman's recovery. And I find this CNN poll interesting.\n\nAccording to the poll, 39% of Americans say they support the health care law, up from 35% in December, a record low in CNN polling. The uptick of four percentage points is within the survey's sampling error. Fifty-seven percent of those questioned say they oppose the measure, down five points from December. \"Not all of the opposition to the health care law comes from the right,\" said CNN Polling Director Keating Holland. \"Thirty-nine percent say they oppose the law because it's too liberal, but 12% say they oppose it because it's not liberal enough.\" That means half the public either favors Obamacare, or opposes it doesn't go far enough.\n\nBelieve the numbers, ma'am.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.contenttype": "article", "description": "This may be the saddest quote I have ever seen in a newspaper.", "title": "Cost Of Health Care - The Triumph Of Arrant Bullshit On The Affordable Care Act", "og": {"url": "http://www.esquire.com/blogs/politics/cost-of-health-care-031114", "site_name": "Esquire", "type": "article", "description": "This may be the saddest quote I have ever seen in a newspaper.", "title": "The Triumph Of Arrant Bullshit On The Affordable Care Act"}, "twitter": {"site": "@Esquire", "description": "This may be the saddest quote I have ever seen in a newspaper.", "title": "The Triumph Of Arrant Bullshit On The Affordable Care Act"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-03-11T12:30:00-04:00", "sailthru.socialtitle": "The Triumph Of Arrant Bullshit On The Affordable Care Act", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1020421151, affiliate-data=pt=305920&ct=OnSiteESQ&mt=8", "fb": {"app_id": 171874009543995, "pages": 84169421673}, "auto-publish": "evergreen", "sailthru.tags": "News & Politics, politics blog,politics blog", "google-site-verification": "jc-n3hu5vRQZpMR_8zTdWlZclmVbvCl2qFQ2fxka3rc", "keywords": "politics blog,politics blog", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Esquire", "section": "Politics With Charles P.
