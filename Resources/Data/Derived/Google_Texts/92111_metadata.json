Does that mean we\u2019ve arrived at the critical destination for an economic expansion: full employment, meaning a very tight matchup between labor supply and labor demand?\n\nNo, because at 9.8 percent, underemployment is still too high. In earlier work, I showed that the underemployment rate commensurate with full employment is around 8.5 percent. Just in case you think that\u2019s unrealistically low, note that underemployment bottomed out at 8 percent in the last expansion and 7 percent in the 1990s boom (see figure).\n\nSource: BLS; shared areas are recessions.\n\nThus, we\u2019d better learn something about underemployment \u2013 what it is, why it\u2019s still elevated, and what can be done to knock it down to where we need it to be.\n\nUnderemployment, called u6 by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, combines three groups: the unemployed, part-time workers who\u2019d prefer full-time jobs (workers who are literally underemployed), and \u201cmarginally attached\u201d workers (a small subset of people neither working nor actively looking for work, but who would be willing to work if there were more good opportunities available).\n\nThe big story in the rise of u6 was and remains the involuntary part-timers (IPTs). Without at all dismissing the uniquely stark psychological costs of unemployment (especially long-term joblessness), when computing labor market slack, it actually makes more sense to think in terms of desired hours worked. Someone who wants to work full-time can, in reality, work between zero hours (unemployed) and 40 hours (fully employed). This continuum, versus the 0-1 metric of unemployed/employed, provides a more nuanced and accurate measure of labor market slack.\n\nAs the figure shows, one reason it\u2019s taking so long for u6 to come back down is because it went up so much in the recession, climbing about 3 percentage points more than unemployment (u6 rose about 8 points; unemployment, about 5 points). What\u2019s important, albeit obvious, here is that what drove u6 up so high was the big, negative demand shock known as the Great Recession. That\u2019s a cyclical increase, one that can be (and is being) reversed by strong job growth, as opposed to a structural increase, one we\u2019d expect to persist even as the economy strengthened.\n\nSome who disagree with that assessment blame the rise in IPTs on Obamacare. Since the law includes employer mandates, phased in over 2015-16, that apply to firms with over 50 full-time workers, some argue that the Affordable Care Act (health-care reform) is already causing employers to move full-time employees into part-time work to avoid the mandate.\n\nNot so. The Bureau of Labor Statistics breaks data on part-time work into two categories: voluntary and involuntary. The data clearly show a decline in IPTs and an increase in voluntary part-timers. As I show here, the decline in IPTs is of a magnitude you\u2019d expect given the pace of the recovery. As Dean Baker shows here, the increase in voluntary part-time work has been largest among young parents, which is an unequivocally positive development. These parents likely had to work full-time to obtain health insurance in the pre-Obamacare world, but now, as Dean explains, \u201cIt seems the ACA [is] allowing young parents the option of working part-time in order to spend more time with their kids\u201d while still getting coverage.\n\nIf this trend proves to be lastingly true, unlocking the \u201cjob lock\u201d described above will turn out to be an extremely worthy and heretofore underappreciated aspect of health-care reform. In the meantime, the evidence suggests that Obamacare is not a factor in the elevated numbers of IPTs (nor, by extension, with the elevated rate of u6). Which makes sense; the vast majority of firms and workers affected by the mandate already have coverage (well under 1 percent of employees work 30 to 34 hours a week and are employed by businesses affected by the employer mandate and do not have insurance).\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019ll necessarily be able to get back to the 7 percent of the late 1990s. There are three structural changes underway that actually may have had an impact on the elevated rate: a shift to service industries (like wholesale and retail trade or food services), which are more prone than others (like manufacturing) to using part-timers; demographic shifts to older workers, who, relative to younger workers, tend to prefer full-time work; and a shift toward \u201cjust-in-time\u201d staffing, where employers micromanage workers\u2019 schedules based on subtle shifts in demand.\n\nWhile these structural changes add to IPTs in both bad times and good, they can\u2019t account for much of their rise. It\u2019s also important to remember that it is beyond economists\u2019 skills to accurately peg unemployment and u6 rates consistent with full employment. We\u2019ve long erred on the high side, meaning that in the name of tilting against an inflationary threat that was often a phantom menace, policymakers have accommodated too much slack.\n\nThe key point here is that, since the elevated u6 problem is largely a cyclical problem, it should continue to come down as the job market tightens. I estimate that if job growth continues at its current pace of around 200,000 per month, we\u2019ll hit 8.5 percent by early 2017. Should job growth accelerate to, say, 250,000, we could hit that (alleged) threshold by late this year.\n\nFor the least advantaged workers to reap the benefits of tight labor markets, reaching full employment won\u2019t be enough. We\u2019ll need to stay there, which means we\u2019ll need to avoid bubbles and preemptive tightening by an overanxious Fed. But that\u2019s a different problem.
