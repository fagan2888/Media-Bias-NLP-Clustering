When there was no sight of Alex Tanguay on the ice as the Avalanche resumed practice Thursday, there was the feeling the news on his condition might not be good. After practice, coach Patrick Roy confirmed Tanguay, the Avs’ last active link to their 2001 Stanley Cup, is out for the rest of the season.

Tanguay will have surgery on his hip Friday morning, Roy said, although his primary injury of late had been to his left knee. The hip problem had contributed to the knee problem, and there was no alternative left but surgery.

“He’s an important player, but at the same time we did well without him,” Roy said. “You never like to lose a player like him, but at the same time it’s part of the game. It’s unfortunate for us, but it will give a chance for some other guys to take over.”

One player Roy might look to the most in that regard is P.A. Parenteau, who has had an up-and-down season and heard his name in trade rumors. Parenteau probably is not on the trade block now, if he ever was. The Avs will need to fill Tanguay’s offensive absence as best they can, and Parenteau was the team’s leading goal scorer last season.

The Avs had a 15-1 record with Tanguay in the lineup. He opened up the ice for other forwards with his passing and vision, and was excellent from the half boards on the power play.

Tanguay still has two years left on his contract at $3.5 million per season, so the hope is that he will make a full recovery in time for next season.
