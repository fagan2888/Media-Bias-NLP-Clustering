He was virtually untouched on the play.\n\n\u201cThe guys did a good job blocking and the receivers did a good job blocking downfield,\u201d he said.\n\nMariota finished with 122 yards on four carries, and threw two touchdown passes. De\u2019Anthony Thomas added three touchdown runs, and the Ducks piled up 557 yards of offense in their first trip to Charlottesville on the way to a 59-10 victory that looked frighteningly easy.\n\nStill, it left first-year head coach Mark Helfrich with plenty to complain about, namely 11 penalties for 119 yards.\n\n\u201cObviously we will clean that up,\u201d Helfrich said.\n\nThe offense, which built a 21-0 lead in the first 10:32, felt like it left a lot on the field, too.\n\n\u201cI thought we did all right,\u201d Mariota said. \u201cThere were some times that we slowed ourselves down with penalties and bad throws. If everything starts to click for us, like those first three drives, I think things will get rolling and we\u2019ll be pretty good.\u201d\n\nThomas ran for 124 yards on just 11 carries, and the Ducks (2-0), who gained a school-record 772 yards last week in beating Nicholls State, looked capable of doing it again against a Virginia defense that hoped to keep the Cavaliers in the game. Oregon\u2019s up-tempo offense did all its damage while possessing the ball for just 21:25.\n\nAs always, Thomas said, their opponents faces\u2019 told the story.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the funny part. For the first couple plays, they\u2019re out there talking, and as the game goes by, guys are just slowing down and you can see by their body language and stuff, and that\u2019s when we know we got \u2018em,\u201d the fleet junior said.\n\nVirginia (1-1) came into the game riding a high after a comeback victory last week against BYU, the first since coach Mike London hired new offensive, defensive and special teams coordinators. Defensive coordinator Jon Tenuta\u2019s unit, especially, seemed confident it would be able to slow the Ducks down, but Mariota provided a very early look at what it was up against.\n\n\u201cWe knew they are fast and athletic,\u201d London said. \u201cWe tried to practice the pace, but it\u2019s hard to practice for that type of athleticism that they have. It is always a challenge when you face an offense like that.\u201d\n\nThe victory was the Ducks\u2019 16th in a row on their opponent\u2019s field, the longest streak in the country.\n\nMariota finished 14 of 28 for 199 yards with touchdowns of 30 yards to Bralon Addison and 11 to Keanon Lowe.\n\nThe Cavaliers trailed 21-0 after 10:32 and never were able to sustain anything on offense. David Watford was 29 for 41 for 161 yards, but threw three interceptions and fumbled once, and all four turnovers led to Oregon touchdowns.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just learning every week, and that\u2019s all I can do,\u201d Watford, a first-year starter, said.\n\nVirginia\u2019s lone touchdown came on a 45-yard run by Khalek Shepherd.\n\nAfter Mariota\u2019s long run, the teams exchanged punts, and when the Cavaliers Alec Vozenilek punted again from his 14, Josh Huff deflected the ball out of bounds at the Cavaliers\u2019 14. Three plays later, Thomas went through the line from a yard out for the touchdown, and it was 14-0 after 7:45.\n\nThe Cavaliers got their first two first downs of the game on the next series before Watford rolled right, threw downfield on the run and the ball glanced off Dominique Terrell\u2019s hands into the arms of Terrance Mitchell, who returned the interception 16 yards to the Virginia 40. On the next play, Thomas went around the right side and down the sideline, tight-roping the line for a touchdown, and it was 21-0.\n\nShepherd\u2019s touchdown gave the biggest crowd at Scott Stadium in five years reason for hope, pulling the Cavaliers within 21-7, and when the defense held on the next two series, the excitement grew.\n\nBut early in the second quarter, Thomas ripped off a 22-yard run, took a swing pass 28 yards down the sideline and Mariota hit Bralon Addison with a short pass that turned into a 30-yard touchdown.\n\nThree plays. Eighty yards. Less than a minute off the clock. And the Ducks were rolling again.\n\nThomas added an 8-yard TD run in the third quarter, and Mariota hit Keannon Lowe from 11 yards for a touchdown to make it 45-10, prompting both coaches to begin substituting liberally. Freshman tailback Thomas Tyner made the most of his chance, carrying four times for 51 yards and two touchdowns, including a 31-yarder midway through the final quarter.\n\nKevin Parks led Virginia with 60 yards rushing, and Jake McGee caught eight passes, but for just 53 yards.", "article_metadata": {"description": "De'Anthony Thomas ran for 124 yards and three touchdowns, Marcus Mariota threw for two touchdowns and ran 71 yards for another score and No. 2 Oregon started fast and manhandled Virginia 59-10 Saturday.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "De\u2019Anthony Thomas ran for 124 yards and three touchdowns, Marcus Mariota threw for two touchdowns and ran 71 yards for another score and No. 2 Oregon started fast and manhandled Virginia 59-10 Saturday.", "title": "Oregon gets off to fast start in victory over Virginia", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/sep/7/oregon-gets-fast-start-victory-over-virginia/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2013/09/07/oregon-virginia-footb_harr.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2013/09/07/oregon-virginia-footb_harr.jpg", "description": "De'Anthony Thomas ran for 124 yards and three touchdowns, Marcus Mariota threw for two touchdowns and ran 71 yards for another score and No. 2 Oregon started fast and manhandled Virginia 59-10 Saturda", "card": "summary", "title": "Oregon gets off to fast start in victory over Virginia"}, "Author": "Hank Kurz", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Sports, Marcus Mariota, Thomas Tyner"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdfda5\"", "article_summary": "Virginia (1-1) came into the game riding a high after a comeback victory last week against BYU, the first since coach Mike London hired new offensive, defensive and special teams coordinators.\n2 Oregon wasted no time showing Virginia all that speed the Ducks bring is more than just talk.\nKevin Parks led Virginia with 60 yards rushing, and Jake McGee caught eight passes, but for just 53 yards.\nStill, it left first-year head coach Mark Helfrich with plenty to complain about, namely 11 penalties for 119 yards.\nMariota finished 14 of 28 for 199 yards with touchdowns of 30 yards to Bralon Addison and 11 to Keanon Lowe."}
