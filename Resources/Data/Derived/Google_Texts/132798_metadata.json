It comes just a few years after the voucher program first launched.\n\nAnd the number of those students heading straight into vouchers is likely to increase, even though one original intent of the program was to provide an alternative to parents and students for whom public school wasn\u2019t working.\n\nThe original voucher law required students to attend a full year of public school \u2014 first grade or higher \u2014 before they could obtain a voucher for private school.\n\nSupporters of the provision had dual goals. They wanted students to try their local public schools \u2014 the backbone of the state\u2019s education system \u2014 before leaving them for a private alternative. Otherwise, some feared, the public schools could be gutted of the best students \u2014 with some of the most-involved parents \u2014 before they ever learned whether public schools would fit their needs.\n\nBut secondly, the state\u2019s fiscal leaders were concerned about the financial viability of doing anything else.\n\nHere\u2019s why: Roughly 8 percent of students in Indiana have historically attended a private school \u2014 most without ever entering the public school system. Until recently, the state didn\u2019t pay for the education of any of those students.\n\nSo as lawmakers started crafting the voucher plan, fiscal leaders had a big concern: What if the kids already in private schools started receiving vouchers? That would add to the cost of education in Indiana.\n\nEnter the requirement that students attend public school first. That would mean vouchers could only go to those students whom the state was already funding. And because vouchers are generally worth about $4,000 and the state spends about $6,000 per student on public schools, the state would see some savings from the program \u2014 money that would be plowed back into the public schools.\n\nBut some voucher supporters won support for changes that have expanded vouchers to more students. Now, students who have a sibling in the program, who live in a school zone with an F rating or who receive special education services automatically qualify for a voucher \u2014 as long as the family also meets income requirements.\n\nThat\u2019s why today, an increasing number of students who have never attended public school are receiving vouchers.\n\nAccording to a new Department of Education report, that cost the state some $16 million in additional funding during the last school year, prompting an outcry from voucher opponents, including Democrats.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re giving taxpayers the bait and switch,\u201d said Senate Minority Leader Tim Lanane, D-Anderson. \u201cI don\u2019t think Hoosiers will be happy to know that their money isn\u2019t getting the bang for its buck they were promised.\u201d\n\nVoucher proponents don\u2019t agree with the formula the state is using to calculate the $16 million. They say \u2014 and their arguments have merit \u2014 that the state is overestimating the number of students who would have gone to private school anyway.\n\n\u201cIt is fair to presume most of the students \u2026 have been diverted from the public school system, whether it can be documented or not,\u201d writes Jeff Spalding, an analyst for the Friedman Foundation for Educational Choice, which supports the program.\n\nHis calculations show that the state is still saving money from vouchers.\n\nRegardless of who\u2019s right, the percentage of voucher students who\u2019ve never attended public school is likely to keep growing \u2014 especially if lawmakers further loosen voucher eligibility, which seems probable.\n\nIt\u2019s up to fiscal leaders to get a handle on whether that will cost the state or save the state money. The answer will be crucial to budgeting in future years \u2014 no matter what side of the voucher debate those leaders support.\n\nLesley Weidenbener is executive editor of TheStatehouseFile.com, a news website powered by Franklin College journalism students.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://cjky.it/1iuWMko", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Nearly half the kids who used state-funded vouchers to attend private school last year never tried the public system first.", "og": {"site_name": "The Courier-Journal", "description": "Nearly half the kids who used state-funded vouchers to attend private school last year never tried the public system first.", "title": "Indiana voucher report raises funding questions", "url": "http://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/education/2014/06/21/indiana-voucher-report-raises-funding-questions/11211009/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/courier-journal.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Nearly half the kids who used state-funded vouchers to attend private school last year never tried the public system first.", "title": "Indiana voucher report raises funding questions", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/b31b4547227f7db9c3991276c5175acc451c9fcd/c=200-0-1800-1600&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/Louisville/2014/06/21/filevouchers.jpg", "creator": "@courierjournal", "site": "@courierjournal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600030236", "fb": {"app_id": 128534137209813}, "viewport": "width=1070", "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Organizations/U.S. Department of Education", "gci-asset-type": "story", "gci-categories": "Organizations/U.S. Department of Education", "title": "Indiana voucher report raises funding questions", "author": "Lesley Weidenbener", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "news/education", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/4226a0c0d78da9e929d18873f588852e49202f93/c=400-0-1600-1600/local/-/media/Louisville/2014/06/21/filevouchers.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/a6775ccf12f60d2db79c8ae8ccbf844c9b573684/c=200-0-1800-1600/local/-/media/Louisville/2014/06/21/filevouchers.jpg", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/04d562e315f85f504774b0158b4a7568ef3b2721/c=0-50-2000-1550/local/-/media/Louisville/2014/06/21/filevouchers.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/f51c57ab3cf70074192140013470f17685f4a1e9/c=0-238-2000-1363&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/Louisville/2014/06/21/filevouchers.jpg", "publishtime": "2014-06-21T13:55:58-04:00", "shorthed": "Ind. voucher report raises questions", "articleid": 11211009, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/013f87903a18e15321c8e4cfc7d1046e17f65033/c=0-238-2000-1363/local/-/media/Louisville/2014/06/21/filevouchers.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/7de611b60d115cc2dc5836d17a97d2ea5c70825a/c=550-0-1450-1600/local/-/media/Louisville/2014/06/21/filevouchers.jpg"}}, "news_keywords": "vouchers, Indiana public schools, Lesley Weidenbener"}, "article_summary": "The original voucher law required students to attend a full year of public school \u2014 first grade or higher \u2014 before they could obtain a voucher for private school.\nHere\u2019s why: Roughly 8 percent of students in Indiana have historically attended a private school \u2014 most without ever entering the public school system.\nIt comes just a few years after the voucher program first launched.\nHer parent chose to keep her in an IPS School over a private school.\nKatherine Maners, a kindergartener at Indianapolis Public Schools student works in class on Sept. 29, 2011, in Indianapolis."}
