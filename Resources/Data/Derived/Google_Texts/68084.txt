Republicans like the 2010 health care law better when it's called by its proper name -- the Affordable Care Act -- instead of Obamacare, according to a new Fox News poll.

Republican support for the law jumped eight percent, from 14 percent for Obamacare to 22 percent for the Affordable Care Act, when pollsters revised the question's language.

Overall support increased from 34 percent to 39 percent with the change. Democratic support moved one percent; independent support rose four percent.

The poll of 900 registered voters was conducted from Sept. 6 to 9, using live telephone interviews. According to the poll, 443 people were asked about Obamacare; 457 were asked about the Affordable Care Act.
