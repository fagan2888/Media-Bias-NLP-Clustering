He was 88.\n\nLaura Prewitt, executive director of the Breeders\u2019 Cup Festival in Lexington, Kentucky, announced the death, saying Arnsparger died at his home in Athens, Alabama.\n\nThe Miami team that won the Super Bowl in January 1973 had the only perfect season in NFL history.\n\n\u201cBill Arnsparger was a seminal figure in Dolphins history,\u201d the Dolphins said in a statement. \u201cAlong with Coach Shula and so many other great players and coaches, Bill played a pivotal role in establishing the Dolphins as one of the winningest teams in football and flagship franchises in professional sports. Our hearts and prayers go out to his loved ones and friends during this difficult time.\u201d\n\nArnsparger left the Dolphins after the 1974 Super Bowl to become head coach of the New York Giants, where he was 7-28 before he was fired after an 0-7 start in 1976. He returned to Don Shula\u2019s Miami staff and remained with the Dolphins until 1983, helping them reach another Super Bowl.\n\n\u201cI was saddened to learn of the passing of Bill Arnsparger, who I thought was one of the greatest defensive coaches in football,\u201d Shula said in a statement. \u201cHe molded two championship units, the \u2018No-Names\u2019 and the \u2018Killer B\u2019s,\u2019 and was innovative in the way he used personnel.\n\n\u201cHe pioneered situational substitutions with the \u201853\u2019 defense that changed the way the game was played on that side of the ball. If there was a Hall of Fame for assistant coaches, he would be one of the very first inductees. Mary Anne and I want to extend our condolences to B.J. and the entire family.\u201d\n\nArnsparger was LSU\u2019s head coach from 1984-86, leading the Tigers to two Southeastern Conference titles in three season before leaving to become Florida\u2019s athletic director. At Florida, he hired Steve Spurrier as coach\n\n\u201cThis is a sad day for the Gator Nation,\u201d Florida athletic director Jeremy Foley said in a statement. \u201cBill Arnsparger helped right the ship during a very difficult time at the University of Florida.\u201d\n\nArnsparger completed his coaching career as San Diego\u2019s defensive coordinator in the 1992-94 seasons, retiring after the Chargers\u2019 Super Bowl loss in 1995.\n\nAfter serving in the Marines during World War II, Arnsparger played tackle for Woody Hayes at Miami of Ohio, where he teamed with future Michigan coach Bo Schembechler.\n\nArnsparger started his coaching career at his alma mater, spent time under Hayes at Ohio State, and also had stints at Kentucky and Tulane before jumping to the NFL\u2019s Baltimore Colts with Shula in 1964. Arnsparger coached the Colts\u2019 defensive line on teams that reached the 1964 NFL title game and 1969 Super Bowl.\n\nFuneral services will be held in his hometown of Paris, Kentucky, where he was born in 1926.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Bill Arnsparger, the Miami assistant coach who directed the \"No-Name Defense\" that helped the Dolphins win Super Bowl titles in 1973 and 1974, died Friday.
