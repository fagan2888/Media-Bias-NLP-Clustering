Previously at National Journal, she served as senior analyst for the Hotline, where she covered federal and gubernatorial campaigns in the South. Full Bio\n\nThe Sen\u00adate will vote Monday even\u00ading to ad\u00advance le\u00adgis\u00adla\u00adtion that will fund the gov\u00adern\u00adment through Dec. 11, kick\u00ading the can on fed\u00ader\u00adal spend\u00ading in\u00adto the winter and a Boehner-free Con\u00adgress. The up\u00adper cham\u00adber is ex\u00adpec\u00adted to pass the le\u00adgis\u00adla\u00adtion, which main\u00adtains fund\u00ading for Planned Par\u00adent\u00adhood over con\u00adser\u00advat\u00adive ob\u00adjec\u00adtions, as early as Tues\u00adday, giv\u00ading the House just over 24 hours to send the fund\u00ading bill to Pres\u00adid\u00adent Obama\u2019s desk.\n\nBoehner has said that he\u2019ll do just that, in one of his fi\u00adnal acts as speak\u00ader, passing the clean fund\u00ading bill with the help of Demo\u00adcrats and Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adans still loy\u00adal to their de\u00adpart\u00ading lead\u00ader. Con\u00adser\u00advat\u00adives had vowed to hold a vote to take away Boehner\u2019s gavel if he forced a vote on a clean bill, but with that point now moot, con\u00adser\u00advat\u00adives are shift\u00ading their fo\u00adcus to the up\u00adcom\u00ading lead\u00ader\u00adship elec\u00adtions and their next op\u00adpor\u00adtun\u00adity to de\u00adfund Planned Par\u00adent\u00adhood\u2014an\u00adoth\u00ader spend\u00ading bill in Decem\u00adber. A few dozen con\u00adser\u00advat\u00adive mem\u00adbers are still ex\u00adpec\u00adted to op\u00adpose the CR, but even mem\u00adbers of the House Free\u00addom Caucus ad\u00admit there will not be enough votes to take down the bill and force a shut\u00addown. \u201cIt\u2019s not go\u00ading to hap\u00adpen,\u201d Rep. Matt Sal\u00admon said Fri\u00adday.\n\nThe real ac\u00adtion in the House will come in the form of phone calls and whip lists clutched to the chests of the next would-be speak\u00ader and oth\u00ader mem\u00adbers look\u00ading for a seat at the new lead\u00ader\u00adship table. Though the elec\u00adtion for speak\u00ader won\u2019t oc\u00adcur un\u00adtil late Oc\u00adto\u00adber, sev\u00ader\u00adal mem\u00adbers are already tak\u00ading a look at the race, and Ma\u00adjor\u00adity Lead\u00ader Kev\u00adin Mc\u00adCarthy, the clear front-run\u00adner for the job, could face com\u00adpet\u00adi\u00adtion. A host of oth\u00ader mem\u00adbers are look\u00ading to move up if Mc\u00adCarthy wins.\n\nHere\u2019s what else is on tap this week:\n\nHealth Care\n\nThe Sen\u00adate on Monday will vote on a con\u00adtinu\u00ading res\u00adol\u00adu\u00adtion that in\u00adcludes Planned Par\u00adent\u00adhood fund\u00ading. A spend\u00ading bill must make it through both cham\u00adbers by mid\u00adnight on Wed\u00adnes\u00adday to keep the gov\u00adern\u00adment open.\n\nThe House will con\u00adsider a bill that amends the small-group-mar\u00adket rules of the Af\u00adford\u00adable Care Act. The le\u00adgis\u00adla\u00adtion cur\u00adrently has 187 Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adan and 45 Demo\u00adcrat\u00adic co\u00adspon\u00adsors.\n\nThe House Over\u00adsight and Gov\u00adern\u00adment Re\u00adform Com\u00admit\u00adtee will hold a hear\u00ading on Tues\u00adday in\u00advest\u00adig\u00adat\u00ading Planned Par\u00adent\u00adhood.

The bill was sup\u00adposed to get a vote at a markup last week, but was pulled as both parties con\u00adtin\u00adued to dis\u00adagree about how to ad\u00address is\u00adsues such as cli\u00admate change and re\u00adnew\u00adable en\u00adergy.\n\nThe Sen\u00adate En\u00advir\u00adon\u00adment and Pub\u00adlic Works Com\u00admit\u00adtee on Tues\u00adday will hear from En\u00advir\u00adon\u00adment\u00adal Pro\u00adtec\u00adtion Agency air chief Janet Mc\u00adCabe at a hear\u00ading on the eco\u00adnom\u00adic im\u00adpact of the up\u00adcom\u00ading rule on ground-level ozone and car\u00adbon-pol\u00adlu\u00adtion stand\u00adards from power plants.\n\nThe House Sci\u00adence, Space, and Tech\u00adno\u00adlogy Com\u00admit\u00adtee will probe for an\u00adswers on the search for life on oth\u00ader plan\u00adets with a hear\u00ading on Tues\u00adday that will con\u00advene one of NASA\u2019s chief sci\u00adent\u00adists as well as ex\u00adperts in as\u00adtro\u00adnomy, as\u00adtro\u00adphys\u00adics, and space.\n\nTechnology\n\nThe House En\u00adergy and Com\u00admerce Com\u00admit\u00adtee\u2019s sub\u00adcom\u00admit\u00adtee on trade will hold a hear\u00ading Tues\u00adday morn\u00ading to ex\u00adam\u00adine the policy im\u00adplic\u00ada\u00adtions of the so-called \u201cshar\u00ading eco\u00adnomy\u201d ser\u00advices like Uber and Airb\u00adnb.
