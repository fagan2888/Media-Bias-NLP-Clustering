Geno Auriemma thinks men's basketball isn't very entertaining right now.

Auriemma said during a conference call Wednesday that as a spectator, the game's "a joke."

Auriemma's team leads the country in scoring at 89.7 points a game and he said the women's game isn't much better, down three points a game.

The numbers back up his claim.

For only the second time in the past 15 years, teams in the women's NCAA Tournament are outscoring their male counterparts. Women's basketball teams are averaging 69.5 points a game in the first four rounds while the men's teams are averaging just 67.8 points.

The differential has been getting closer since 2007 when the men were scoring six points more a game then the women, according to STATS.

Auriemma said that he's speaking more as a fan than a basketball coach.
