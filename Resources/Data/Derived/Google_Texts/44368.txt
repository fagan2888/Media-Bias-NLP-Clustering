(CNSNews.com) - Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, asked for his reaction to the resignation of John Boehner, had good things to say about the House Speaker:



"We'll have to see how it plays out," Bush told "Fox News Sunday" with Chris Wallace. "I admire John Boehner greatly. He's a great public servant. He left at the apex of his--of his time in service to this--to the country, with the Pope speaking in Congress.

"I think people are going to miss him in the long run, because he's a -- he's a person that is focused on solving problems."



Asked if Boehner's departure is good or bad for conservatives," Bush said he's not sure:



"I think what we need is a conservative president that can work with the Congress. We wouldn't have these problems if you had a president that actually would commit to passing a budget, would commit to a -- you know, repealing Obamacare, reforming our taxes."



House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) also praised Boehner on Sunday: "John Boehner is a very fine person," Pelosi told CNN's "State of the Union" with Jake Tapper. "I don't know if I'll miss him," she added. "It depends on what comes next."



Pelosi said Boehner's resignation "is a sign of the disarray in the Republican Party."



Republican Carly Fiorina said Boehner made the right decision to step down:



"I think every leader has a season, and I think John Boehner's season was coming to an end, and he understood that. And I hope now that we will move on and have leadership in both the House and the Senate that will produce results.



"I think leaders produce results, and I think Republicans are quite frustrated having worked very hard to restore historic majorities to the House and a majority to the Senate that there haven't been a lot of results."
