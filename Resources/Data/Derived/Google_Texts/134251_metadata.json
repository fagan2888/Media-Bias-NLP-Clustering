Obama swiftly condemned the effort as attempted political extortion, and the Republican-friendly Chamber of Commerce pointedly called on lawmakers to pass urgent spending and borrowing legislation \u2013 unencumbered by debate over \u201cObamacare.\u201d\n\nBack in the press conference, Karl asked if the White House was \u201cgiving up\u201d in the negotiations and refusing to talk to Republicans.\n\n\u201cAre you actually talking to Republicans?\u201d he asked, even if he believes his opponents are \u201cunreasonable\u201d in their pursuits.\n\n\u201cThe president\u2019s position is, he will not negotiate over the debt ceiling,\u201d Karl pressed.\n\n\u201cCorrect,\u201d Carney replied.\n\n\u201cHow is that tenable?\u201d Karl shot back, adding that it\u2019s practically \u201cthreatening default\u201d by the White House.\n\nThe White House spokesman argued only Congress has the power to raise the debt ceiling. He did, however, fail to mention the immense influence President Obama has over the process and Democratic lawmakers.\n\nCarney said raising the debt ceiling does not increase new spending and has been \u201chundreds of times before.\u201d\n\n\u201cRaising the debt ceiling doesn\u2019t add a dime to the deficit,\u201d he added. \u201cBut as everyone in this room understands\u2026this is simply a vote to allow Congress to pay the bills that Congress has already incurred.\u201d\n\nFeatured image via AP.
