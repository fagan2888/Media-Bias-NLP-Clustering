She notes how the media is silent when a mother wielding a firearm protects herself from a violent offender. Yet, if she\u2019s unarmed and tragically killed in a confrontation, \u201cthe cameras will be at the scene before the police.\u201d She wants gun-owning moms to speak out and challenge the media on their false narratives about the Second Amendment.\n\nOverall, women in general are starting to exercise their Second Amendment rights across the country. They\u2019ve been described as the next big thing in the gun industry, and that bet has paid off. Concerning self-defense, women have been responsible for a surge in gun ownership in states, like Colorado\u2013and have contributed to a 270 percent increase in concealed carry permits since 2007. It\u2019s a trend that\u2019s occurring across the country.\n\nYes, it\u2019s no secret that women are the fastest growing demographic of new gun owners. It\u2019s an aspect that really doesn\u2019t help progressives when they accuse the National Rifle Association of being the domestic abusers lobby (an absurd allegation), or any attack associated with the so-called \u201cwar on women.\u201d How can there be one when ladies across the country are stocking up on firearms?\n\nFifty-one percent of white, middle class women feel that a gun in the home makes them safer. That is quite the political hurdle concerning getting any new gun control legislation passed. As many commentators have noted, it\u2019s almost political suicide to try and ban things that white, middle class women support. Throw gun-owning mothers into the mix and you\u2019re bound to see an anti-gun train wreck occur.\n\nLast Note: Sorry, folks; I forgot to mention this bit. It's not just caucasians who are exercising their Second Amendment rights. There's evidence that shows nonwhites are obtaining their concealed carry permits twice as fast as whites. Moreover, blacks and Hispanics are lining up for their concealed carry permits in Chicago, with the zip code with the highest concentration of CCW permits in Chicago being a predominant nonwhite neighborhood. It should come as no shock given the Windy City is being plagued by a surge in shootings and homicides.\n\nEveryone is exercising their Second Amendment rights\u2013and that's a good thing. Be safe, follow the law, and carry on", "article_metadata": {"description": "New NRA ad urges mother who support the Second Amendment to challenge the media, exercise their rights, and cherish the freedom we have to defend our families. .05/26/2016 0:02:50AM EST.", "author": "Matt Vespa", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "New NRA ad urges mother who support the Second Amendment to challenge the media, exercise their rights, and cherish the freedom we have to defend our families.", "title": "Matt Vespa - Dana Loesch Says Media, Violent Criminals Shouldn't Mess With Gun-Owning Moms", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/mattvespa/2015/09/11/dana-loesch-urges-moms-to-speak-out-in-defense-of-their-second-amendment-rights-in-new-nra-ad-n2050745", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/uploads/2015/9/11/0.png", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "New NRA ad urges mother who support the Second Amendment to challenge the media, exercise their rights, and cherish the freedom we have to defend our families.", "title": "Matt Vespa - Dana Loesch Says Media, Violent Criminals Shouldn't Mess With Gun-Owning Moms", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/mattvespa/2015/09/11/dana-loesch-urges-moms-to-speak-out-in-defense-of-their-second-amendment-rights-in-new-nra-ad-n2050745", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/uploads/2015/9/11/0.png", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Dana Loesch Says Media, Violent Criminals Shouldn't Mess With Gun-Owning Moms , Matt Vespa, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd36ba\"", "article_summary": "There's evidence that shows nonwhites are obtaining their concealed carry permits twice as fast as whites.\nOverall, women in general are starting to exercise their Second Amendment rights across the country.\nIt's not just caucasians who are exercising their Second Amendment rights.\nEveryone is exercising their Second Amendment rights\u2013and that's a good thing.\nMoreover, blacks and Hispanics are lining up for their concealed carry permits in Chicago, with the zip code with the highest concentration of CCW permits in Chicago being a predominant nonwhite neighborhood."}
