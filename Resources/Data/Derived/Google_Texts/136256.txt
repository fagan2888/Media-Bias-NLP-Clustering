Home prices are rising across the country â€” or so it seems. A CoreLogic survey out Tuesday showed that U.S. house values increased 6.4 percent in September compared with a year ago, marking 15 months of steady gains between 4.8 percent and 6.5 percent.

But a closer look at the report reveals that only 11 states posted price gains that outpaced the national average. Houses in the remaining 39 states and the District of Columbia fell below the average with Wyoming recording no gain at all and Louisiana and Mississippi logging in year-over-year price declines in September.
