Last October, after CNET’s Dan Terdiman broke the story that Google was building a mysterious structure on top of a barge docked near Treasure Island, the news instantly plugged into San Francisco’s ongoing tech-culture wars. A luxury showroom for Google Glass — or, in Google’s words, “an interactive space where people can learn about new technology” — seemed to some critics like the wrong note to play in a city obsessed with the gentrification and displacement implications of Google buses.

A typical comment at the time:

Imagine if Google had taken all the money they used to build these totally unnecessary vanity items, and used that money to instead build affordable housing for all the working people who’ve been displaced by overpaid Google employees?

Eight months later, the tech culture wars are still going strong, but the Google Barge appears headed to the scrap heap. The Portland Press-Herald is reporting that Google’s East Coast barge prototype has been sold and that its four-story structure built from modular containers will be scrapped. Google hasn’t commented on the story, but according to Terdiman, there’s been no new construction on the West Coast barge, now docked at Stockton, since at least March.

“That makes Google’s dream of operating a destination retail experience just that: a dream,” wrote Terdiman.
