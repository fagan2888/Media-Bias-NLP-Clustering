At first, they treated \u201cThe Donald\u2019s\u201d candidacy as a welcome distraction from Hillary Clinton. But then Trump broke one of their cardinal rules \u2014 \u201cThou shalt not take cheap shots at Sen. John McCain\u201d \u2014 and from that point forward, the relentless snark has been traded for \u201csmarm\u201d as far as the eye can see.\n\nAnd with Trump still holding a small but significant lead over his rivals in national polling, the smarm is only getting worse. The smarm coming from Republicans is easy enough to explain; if he wins the nomination or runs as a third-party candidate, the GOP will lose in 2016. But elite media is getting rather smarmy, too; and it\u2019s hard not to conclude that elitism is part of the reason why they write about Trump\u2019s fans as if they were anthropological curiosities. After all, how are Trump supporters any weirder than those who\u2019ve decided to back eccentric amateurs like Ben Carson or Carly Fiorina?\n\nWhich isn\u2019t to say their incomprehension is fake. However smarmy their questions about his fans may be, the media\u2019s complete inability to puncture Trump\u2019s bubble shows that they come by their cluelessness honestly. They seem to think that if Trump backers are shown proof of his inconsistent conservatism, they\u2019ll abandon him. So we get articles cataloging Trump\u2019s \u201cflip-flops\u201d and heresies, and are expected to be surprised when they fail to make an impact. But this fundamentally misunderstands why so many people find Trump so appealing.\n\nIt\u2019s not what Trump\u2019s for that makes his fans love him. They love him instead because of what he is against. Even more specifically, it\u2019s who he\u2019s against \u2014 and who is against him \u2014 that, in Trump\u2019s backers\u2019 eyes, makes him so great. Obviously, when it comes to the \u201chaters\u201d and \u201closers\u201d who comprise Trump\u2019s enemies, Mexicans and other immigrants are at the top of the list. After all, these are the \u201ccriminals, drug dealers, rapists, etc.\u201d who are taking American jerbs and bringing in \u201cinfectious disease.\u201d But it\u2019s not only Latinos who are to be hated; it\u2019s China and Japan, too.\n\nRacism and xenophobia are operative here, no doubt. But Trump\u2019s brand of populist rage is rather free-floating; and his supporters seem to be even more passionate about his domestic foes. As Elspeth Reeve put it in the New Republic, some Trumpites love him because he is so aggressively politically incorrect. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t know what \u2018PC\u2019 means,\u201d as one New Hampshire supporter raved. For these people, Reeve writes, Trump is appealing because \u201che violates social taboos but not their own political sensibilities.\u201d He says what they believe but don\u2019t have the guts to say for themselves.\n\nGranted, this sounds like a pretty frivolous metric to use when deciding who should be president. But humans can be exceedingly tribal and frivolous things! And because Trump\u2019s fans believe that political correctness is primarily enforced by an ill-defined group of elites, his willingness to say things that most of us would consider grotesquely uncouth and bigoted is understood as a more wide-ranging opposition to the powers that be. Look, for example, at how Rush Limbaugh, another veteran practitioner of political resentment, recently defended Trump. He focuses almost exclusively on the billionaire\u2019s critics, rather than the man himself:", "article_metadata": {"description": "The media's attempts to take Trump down are doomed.
