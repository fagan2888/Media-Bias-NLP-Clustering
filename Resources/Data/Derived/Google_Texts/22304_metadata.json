The partnership provides consumers with enrollment support, giving them the option of continuing their health insurance through COBRA or enrolling in a new individual Marketplace health plan\u2013putting the consumer in the driver\u2019s seat.\n\nThe GoHealth Marketplace provides education and accessibility to a wide range of individual insurance options and allows consumers to compare benefits from the nation\u2019s top insurance carriers, apply for subsidies (to reduce health insurance premiums and out-of-pocket expenses), and enroll in an individual health insurance plan. GoHealth also provides decision support tools and guidance from licensed insurance advisors to make the process easier and worry-free.\n\nChief Strategy Officer at Benaissance, Mark Waterstraat, explains how the GoHealth Marketplace meets the needs of employers and employees in the shifting health care environment.\n\n\u201cHealth insurance benefits are more consumer-centric than ever before. Employers desire to align benefits that meet the needs of individuals. We believe COBRA will always have a place for employees experiencing work and life transitions. For example, an employee who desires to keep their current coverage because they have met a deductible. Our new relationship with GoHealth provides a trusted alternative to COBRA and is less intimidating than going to the open market alone to secure coverage. GoHealth is an industry leader and we trust them to provide a great experience for any of our customers exploring their health insurance options.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe recognize in today\u2019s insurance marketplace, COBRA may not be the best solution for everyone,\u201d says Clint Jones, chief executive officer at GoHealth. \u201cToday\u2019s consumers have choices and if they choose to seek benefits outside of COBRA, we will be ready with our robust, user-friendly, health insurance marketplace. Through this partnership, our goal is to give COBRA-eligible consumers the very best experience and connect them with subsidies that could ease some of the financial strain these individuals may be experiencing.\u201d\n\nBenaissance\n\nBenaissance is the trusted financial management partner for health benefits administration.
