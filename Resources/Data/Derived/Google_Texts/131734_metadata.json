I\u2019m the only driver, so I went to get it. On the way back I laughed at the local radio stations going on and on and on, still buzzing about Obama taking a selfie at Nelson Mandela\u2019s funeral. Who cares?\n\nNo really, who? Especially since the funeral was weeks ago.\n\n* * *\n\nI arrived, fifth of Black Watch clenched close to me like a newborn with three red cold-cups covering the top. We play spades over at Miss Sheryl\u2019s place in Douglass Housing Projects every few weeks. (Actually, Miss Sheryl\u2019s name isn\u2019t really Miss Sheryl. But I changed some names here, because I\u2019m not into embarrassing my friends.) Her court is semi-boarded up, third world and looks like an ad for \u201cThe Wire.\u201d Even though her complex is disgustingly unfit, it\u2019s still overpopulated with tilting dope fiends, barefoot children, pregnant smokers, grandmas with diabetes, tattoo-faced tenants and a diverse collection of Zimmermans made up of street dudes and housing police, looking itchy to shoot anyone young and black and in Nike.\n\nTwo taps on the door, it opened and the gang was all there \u2014 four disenfranchised African-Americans posted up in a 9 x 11 prison-size tenement, one of those spots where you enter the front door, take a half-step and land in the yard. I call us disenfranchised, because Obama\u2019s selfie with some random lady or the whole selfie movement in general is more important than us and the conditions where we dwell.\n\nSurprisingly, as tight as Miss Sheryl\u2019s unit may be, it\u2019s still more than enough space for us to receive affordable joy from a box of 50-cent cards and a rail bottle.\n\n\u201cA yo, Michelle was gonna beat on Barack for taking dat selfie with dat chick at the Mandela wake! Whateva da fuk a selfie is! What\u2019s a selfie, some type of bailout?\u201d yelled Dontay from the kitchen, dumping Utz chips into a cracked flowery bowl. I was placing cubes into all of our cups and equally distributing the vodka like, \u201cSome for you and some for you \u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat the fuck is a selfie?\u201d said Miss Sheryl.\n\n\u201cWhen a stupid person with a smartphone flicks themselves and looks at it,\u201d I said to the room. She replied with a raised eyebrow, \u201cOh?\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s amazing how the news seems so instant to most from my generation with our iPhones, Wi-Fi, tablets and iPads, but actually it isn\u2019t. The idea of information being class-based as well became evident to me when I watched my friends talk about a weeks-old story as if it happened yesterday.\n\n* * *\n\nMiss Sheryl doesn\u2019t have a computer and definitely wouldn\u2019t know what a selfie is. Her cell runs on minutes and doesn\u2019t have a camera. Like many of us, she\u2019s too poor to participate in pop culture. She\u2019s on public assistance living in public housing and scrambles for odd jobs to survive.\n\nSheryl lost her job as a cook moments after she lost her daughter to heroin, her son Meaty to crack and her kidneys to soul food. It took 15 to 20 unanswered applications a week for over a year for her to realize that no company wants to employ a woman on dialysis. Sometimes Bucket-Head and I chip in and buy groceries for her and her grandson Lil Kevin who has severe lead-paint poisoning, but was diagnosed late and is too old to receive a check.\n\nBucket-Head is a convicted felon but not really. He was charged with a crime that he didn\u2019t commit. I know this because my late cousin did the shooting and our whole neighborhood watched. Bucket was in the wrong place at the wrong time and as many know, we are products of a \u201cNo Snitching\u201d culture.\n\nAs a result, the only work Bucket can find after 10 years of false imprisonment is that of laborer with the Mexicans who post up in front of 7-Eleven, or as a freelance dishwasher. Bucket\u2019s no angel, but he\u2019s also not a felon and doesn\u2019t deserve to be excluded from pop culture no more than Miss Sheryl or Dontay, who represents the definition of redemption to me.\n\n* * *\n\nI placed our cups at the table and the bottle in the center. \u201cMe and Miss Sheryl are gonna whip ass tonight, hurry up, Dontay!\u201d I yelled.\n\nDontay cleans nonstop. Roaches sleeping in the fridge, roaches relay racing out of the cabinets carrying cereal boxes, purchasing homes, building families, slipping through cracks for fun and weaving in and out of death \u2014 Dontay bleaches them all. Dontay doesn\u2019t take handouts from us and won\u2019t go on government assistance. He couldn\u2019t contribute to the chips and vodka that week so he\u2019s cleaned for Miss Sheryl and would clean for Miss Sheryl even if there were no chips and vodka.\n\n\u201cBoy we ready to play the cards. Stop acting selfie and sit yo ass at the table!\u201d yelled Miss Sheryl from another room. We all laugh. Miss Sheryl\u2019s rooms are separated by white sheets; they look like a soiled ghost at night when the wind blows. Her son Meaty stole and sold her doors years ago and housing never replaced them.\n\nDontay joined us at the table. \u201cTakin forever, boy, wit dem big ass feet!\u201d yelled a happy Bucket. Dontay was wearing my old shoes. They are 13\u2019s and busting at the seams but Dontay\u2019s a size 8 and his foot is digging through the side. His arms are chunked and wrapped in healed sores from years of drug abuse. He\u2019s eight years clean off of the hard stuff now, but I met him way back when I was 13, in his wild days.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Where I live in East Baltimore, everything looks like \"The Wire\" and nobody cares what a \"selfie\" is", "title": "Too poor for pop culture", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Where I live in East Baltimore, everything looks like \"The Wire\" and nobody cares what a \"selfie\" is", "title": "Too poor for pop culture", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/02/05/too_poor_for_pop_culture/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/02/too_poor_pop_culture.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Where I live in East Baltimore, everything looks like \"The Wire\" and nobody cares what a \"selfie\" is", "title": "Too poor for pop culture", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/02/too_poor_pop_culture.jpg", "creator": "@@dwatkinsworld", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "D.
