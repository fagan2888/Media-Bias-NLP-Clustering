Out of an avalanche of litigation, those urging the court to take up the latest challenge to Obamacare have rallied around the petition filed by the Little Sisters of the Poor Home for the Aged.\n\nThe sisters even have a papal endorsement: Pope Francis met with about 35 nuns from the order during his recent visit to Washington to show his support for their lawsuit. The sisters scurried out of Mass early at the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception to be in place to meet the Holy Father.\n\n[Pope lends support to nuns in lawsuit]\n\nBut the Obama administration says there are procedural problems with the Little Sisters\u2019 case, which involves whether employees at their facilities for the elderly receive contraceptive coverage under their health insurance plans just like workers anywhere else, and who should provide it. The Little Sisters, with headquarters in Baltimore, have 30 nursing homes in the United States. The lawsuit involves a home in Denver.\n\nThere are more than a half-dozen cases with similar facts waiting at the Supreme Court, and Solicitor General Donald B. Verrilli Jr. told the justices that just about any of them would provide a better framework for deciding the issue at stake than the one filed by the nuns.\n\n[Ruling sets up Supreme Court showdown on contraceptive mandate]\n\n\u201cThe Little Sisters\u2019 petition would be an especially unsuitable vehicle because of the unusual and uncertain circumstances of the lead petitioners in that case,\u201d Verrilli wrote.\n\nThat set off a tetchy back-and-forth between Verrilli and Paul D. Clement, a solicitor general during the George W. Bush administration, who is representing the nuns.\n\n\u201cAfter impermissibly trying to pick and choose which religious groups to exempt from the contraceptive mandate, (the government) should not now to be allowed to pick and choose its opponent or which questions it must confront in defending its actions,\u201d wrote Clement, retained by the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty on behalf of the Little Sisters.\n\nIt is one of those behind-the-scenes battles at the Supreme Court that can have a major effect on the ultimate outcome.\n\n\u201cThese briefs show a passionate debate over which case is the better vehicle for each side, and the right vehicle can make a difference\u201d in a 5-to-4 case, said Gregory G. Garre, who was also a solicitor general in the Bush administration. \u201cEach side no doubt thinks their legal case is stronger if the court agrees to take the case they want.\u201d\n\nAt issue is the Affordable Care Act\u2019s guarantee of preventive care for women, which the Department of Health and Human Services has interpreted to mean that women covered by group health plans be able to obtain contraceptives at no additional cost.\n\nOriginally, only religious organizations such as churches were exempted. But after protests from religious organizations such as colleges, hospitals and charities, the government devised an accommodation.\n\nTo be eligible, the organization must certify to its insurance company that it opposes coverage for contraceptives. Alternately, it can send a letter to the government saying so and providing the name of its insurance company. The insurers and government take over from there to provide the services.\n\nBut the groups say either of those options serve as a \u201ctrigger\u201d that allows the contraceptives to be provided \u2014 and makes them complicit in what they consider sin.\n\nSix appeals courts across the country have agreed with the government, including in the Little Sisters\u2019 case. But last month, one court went the other way, setting the stage for the Supreme Court to step in.\n\nThe case will be something of a sequel to the court\u2019s 5-to-4 decision in Hobby Lobby v. Burwell last year that said owners of closely held private companies do not have to violate their religious beliefs to provide contraceptive coverage to their workers.\n\n[Supreme court sides with employers in contraceptive mandate case]\n\nClement and Verrilli opposed each other in that case, too.\n\nVerrilli says the better candidate for Supreme Court review is one from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit involving the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Washington, which provides a health plan used by numerous groups in the region.\n\nBut only the Little Sisters\u2019 petition has attracted significant support from those who oppose the government\u2019s requirement.\n\nGretchen Borchelt, vice president for Health and Reproductive Rights at the National Women\u2019s Law Center, which supports the government, understands why.\n\nIt presents the image \u201cof the government going against what is seen as a group of nuns,\u201d she said, although she adds that \u201cwhat\u2019s really at stake is their employees.\u201d\n\nWhen Ilya Shapiro, senior fellow in constitutional studies at the Cato Institute, was looking to file an amicus brief opposing the contraceptive mandate, he chose the nuns\u2019 case.\n\n\u201cThere are so many cases, but the Little Sisters\u2019 has become the iconic one,\u201d he said.\n\nHis argument that government agencies were unsuited to decide which religious groups get exceptions and which do not fit well with the particulars of the case.\n\n\u201cThat HHS refused to exempt people who work for the Little Sisters of the Poor \u2014 a group of nuns who vow obedience to the Pope! \u2014 is a testament to how out-of-their-league the departments were in evaluating and responding to burdens on religion,\u201d he wrote.\n\nMark L. Rienzi, a Catholic University law professor and Becket Fund attorney, acknowledged that there are \u201coptics reasons\u201d for the support his clients have received, but added that \u201cthere are legal reasons, too.\u201d\n\nTheir petition urges the justices to consider not only the nuns\u2019s protection by the Religious Freedom Restoration Act but also under the Constitution.\n\nThe justices are scheduled to take their first look at the petitions in a private conference at the end of the month. They don\u2019t have to pick between the Little Sisters\u2019 and the government\u2019s preferred case; they could take both, or choose from the other petitioners who want their moment at the court.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Obama administration and opponents of the contraceptive mandate disagree about which case is best for court action.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/robert.barnes.3139", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "The Obama administration and opponents of the contraceptive mandate disagree about which case is best for court action.", "title": "At the Supreme Court, \u2018Little Sisters of the Poor\u2019 has a ring to it", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/courts_law/at-supreme-court-little-sisters-of-the-poor-has-a-ring-to-it/2015/10/18/ea7078ac-7415-11e5-8d93-0af317ed58c9_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2015/10/16/National-Politics/Images/HIGHCOURT011445029990.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@scotusreporter"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/courts_law/at-supreme-court-little-sisters-of-the-poor-has-a-ring-to-it/2015/10/18/ea7078ac-7415-11e5-8d93-0af317ed58c9_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "courts", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/robert.barnes.3139"}, "eomportal-uuid": "ea7078ac-7415-11e5-8d93-0af317ed58c9", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "courts"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd83aa\"", "article_summary": "But last month, one court went the other way, setting the stage for the Supreme Court to step in.\nSix appeals courts across the country have agreed with the government, including in the Little Sisters\u2019 case.\nIt is one of those behind-the-scenes battles at the Supreme Court that can have a major effect on the ultimate outcome.\nThe Little Sisters, with headquarters in Baltimore, have 30 nursing homes in the United States.\nIf you are looking for sympathetic plaintiffs to headline a major Supreme Court battle \u2014 well, it never hurts to have on deck an order of nuns called the Little Sisters of the Poor."}
