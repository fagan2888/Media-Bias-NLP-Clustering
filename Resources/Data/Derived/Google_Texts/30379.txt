The crew of the Full Nelson, from left: Kent Thames, Kenneth Nelson, Allen Heape and James Lawton, with the winning 38.00-pound fish caught Saturday in the Fishing for Miracles King Mackerel Tournament.

Kent Thames watched nervously as the digital numbers bounced around on the scale at the Fishing for Miracles King Mackerel Tournament on Saturday afternoon at Ripley Light Yacht Club. Then he let out a yell as the scale settled on 38.00 pounds, enough to give the crew of the boat Full Nelson a razor-thin margin over first-day leader Chili Pepper.

The differential was 0.21 pounds, or about the weight of a deck of playing cards. But it was worth plenty.

In addition to the $25,000 first-place check, Full Nelson also won the Tournament Within A Tournaments for largest fish and two-fish aggregate, Super Tournament Within A Tournament and Early Entry prizes. Altogether, Full Nelson won $52,555.

“I’m a very happy person and so is my crew,” Nelson said.

In addition to second, Chili Pepper finished second in the TWT for largest fish and first in the Single Outboard Engine division, totaling $12,531.

Full Nelson is owned by Kenneth Nelson of James Island. Thames was the angler and Allen Heape and James Lawton also crewed on the boat. Chili Pepper is owned by John Gaeto of Charleston. Robbie Mullen was the angler for Chili Pepper’s catch.

“We felt like it was a good fish,” Nelson said of the catch made about 11:30 a.m. “We caught a good one yesterday, 31 (pounds) and some change. We were on some good fish.”

Nelson said the winning fish was caught using a live bar jack for bait.

Gaeto was disappointed but happy for Nelson. He said the Chili Pepper lost a cylinder on its engine Saturday and decided to return early because the engine was running so rough.
