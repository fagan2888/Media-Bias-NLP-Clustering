Rentschler II Chair at Vanderbilt and director of the center.\n\n\u201cDoctors need to be advocates for improving not just biological conditions, but also social ones.\u201d\n\nTraining beyond medicine\n\nIn an article co-written with Helena Hansen of New York University and published in Social Science and Medicine, Metzl calls for health care workers to be trained in the basics of economics, urban infrastructure, and other societal factors that can affect the health of Americans. The training could be incorporated as part of pre-med undergraduate curriculum, and perhaps be included in new employee orientation at medical facilities.\n\nMetzl says the extra training will make doctors and other health care workers \u201cstructurally competent.\u201d\n\n\u201cStructural competency would teach health care workers to better recognize how, even after the Affordable Care Act, medical issues such as hypertension, depression and obesity sometimes represent the downstream effects of societal decisions about such factors as food distribution networks, transit systems, or urban or rural infrastructure,\u201d Metzl said.\n\nStructural humility\n\nDoctors must also be able to recognize when they are out of their depth on certain issues, and be willing to collaborate with community activists and lawmakers. Metzl calls that \u201cstructural humility.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a moral message that has been lost in the healthcare debate,\u201d Metzl said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s that we have a social mission to keep everybody healthy in a democratic country.\n\n\u201cI feel that medicine has not been vocal enough about making that point.\u201d\n\nTo see more of Jonathan Metz speaking about disparities in health care, see the opening of The Politics of Health conference from 2013.\n\nRead the Social Science and Medicine article.\n\nMedia Inquiries:\n\nJim Patterson, (615) 322-NEWS\n\njim.patterson@vanderbilt.edu", "article_metadata": {"description": "Doctors and other health care workers need to be advocates for improving not just biological conditions, but also social ones, said the director of Vanderbilt University\u2019s Center for Medicine, Health and Society.", "author": "Jim Patterson", "og": {"site_name": "Vanderbilt University", "description": "Doctors and other health care workers need to be advocates for improving not just biological conditions, but also social ones, said the director of Vanderbilt University\u2019s Center for Medicine, Health and Society.", "title": "Doctors need to be political advocates for patients, expert says", "url": "http://news.vanderbilt.edu/2014/03/doctors-political-advocates/", "image": "http://news.vanderbilt.edu/files/ShadeTreeStill-e1394556933438-585x298.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Doctors and other health care workers need to be advocates for improving not just biological conditions, but also social ones, said the director of Vanderbilt University\u2019s Center for Medicine, Health and Society.", "creator": "@VanderbiltU", "url": "http://news.vanderbilt.edu/2014/03/doctors-political-advocates/", "image": {"src": "http://news.vanderbilt.edu/files/ShadeTreeStill-e1394556933438-585x298.jpg"}, "title": "Doctors need to be political advocates for patients, expert says", "site": "@VanderbiltU", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "vusection": "Research", "keywords": "Center for Medicine Health & Society,Experts,featured research,featured story,Jonathan Metzl,Social Science and Medicine,structural competency,structural humility,, vanderbilt, vanderbilt university, nashville, research, university, news", "publication_date": "2014-03-11", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "vufilter": "video"}, "article_summary": "Doctors need to be political advocates for patients, expert saysDoctors and other health care workers of the future need to be political advocates as well as personal advisers, said the director of Vanderbilt University\u2019s Center for Medicine, Health and Society.\nMetzl calls that \u201cstructural humility.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s a moral message that has been lost in the healthcare debate,\u201d Metzl said.\nThe training could be incorporated as part of pre-med undergraduate curriculum, and perhaps be included in new employee orientation at medical facilities.\n\u201cI feel that medicine has not been vocal enough about making that point.\u201dTo see more of Jonathan Metz speaking about disparities in health care, see the opening of The Politics of Health conference from 2013.\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s that we have a social mission to keep everybody healthy in a democratic country."}
