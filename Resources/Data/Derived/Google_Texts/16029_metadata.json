In total, NSA has paid the state more than $1.03 million, The Salt Lake Tribune (http://bit.ly/1gmSMTs ) reported.\n\nThe NSA said it \u201ctakes responsible measures to ensure the security of our workforce,\u201d and works with local law enforcement to do so.\n\n\u201cNSA routinely partners with federal, state and local emergency responders at domestic locations,\u201d the agency said in a statement. \u201cFor a variety of operational security reasons, NSA does not disclose the full range of these relationships.\u201d\n\nCol. Daniel Fuhr with the highway patrol said troopers do not perform any security inside the property. He said there is always at least one trooper posted outside the data center.\n\nFuhr said he\u2019s never heard of anyone attempting to block traffic at the Utah Data Center, and said troopers have not made any arrests or citations for interfering with traffic.\n\nAccording to Fuhr, \u201c99 percent of it is visual deterrence.\u201d\n\nAn anti-government surveillance group called Restore the Fourth - a reference to the 4th Amendment that prohibits unlawful search and seizure_has staged protests on the road outside the building. The group has also \u201cadopted\u201d a highway outside the building through a state transportation department program and will clean up trash along the roadway while carrying signs.\n\nLorina Potter, a representative for Restore the Fourth, said she\u2019s never noticed troopers outside the building and was there most recently on July 4 to pick up trash.\n\nShe said she wasn\u2019t sure why the agency is paying to station highway patrol troopers outside.\n\n\u201cI guess it\u2019s a preventive measure for something that there\u2019s never even been a hint of need for,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s like over-preparation.\u201d\n\nThe center attracted much discussion and concern after revelations in 2013 that the NSA has been collecting millions of U.S. phone records and digital communications stored by major Internet providers.\n\nCybersecurity experts say the nondescript Utah facility is a giant storehouse for phone calls, emails and online records that have been secretly collected.\n\nThe NSA has said the facility would be operational in fall 2013, but it has declined to offer any status updates.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Salt Lake Tribune, http://www.sltrib.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "The National Security Agency has paid Utah more than $1 million over the past year and a half for state troopers to guard the entrance to the spy agency's massive data center south of Salt Lake City, according to Utah Highway Patrol records.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "The National Security Agency has paid Utah more than $1 million over the past year and a half for state troopers to guard the entrance to the spy agency\u2019s massive data center south of Salt Lake City, according to Utah Highway Patrol records.", "title": "Records: NSA paid Utah over $1M to police data center roads", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/aug/1/nsa-paid-utah-more-than-1m-to-police-data-center-r/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/08/01/41312a334a64de227d0f6a706700ed17.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/08/01/41312a334a64de227d0f6a706700ed17.jpg", "description": "The National Security Agency has paid Utah more than $1 million over the past year and a half for state troopers to guard the entrance to the spy agency's massive data center south of Salt Lake City,", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Records: NSA paid Utah over $1M to police data center roads"}, "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca2d1\"", "article_summary": "She said she wasn\u2019t sure why the agency is paying to station highway patrol troopers outside.\nBLUFFDALE, Utah (AP) - The National Security Agency has paid Utah more than $1 million over the past year and a half for state troopers to guard the entrance to the spy agency\u2019s massive data center south of Salt Lake City, according to Utah Highway Patrol records.\nFuhr said he\u2019s never heard of anyone attempting to block traffic at the Utah Data Center, and said troopers have not made any arrests or citations for interfering with traffic.\nFrom January 2014 through March of this year, the NSA has paid for state troopers to sit in their vehicles on roads outside the agency\u2019s data storage warehouse in Bluffdale and ensure no one blocks traffic.\nLorina Potter, a representative for Restore the Fourth, said she\u2019s never noticed troopers outside the building and was there most recently on July 4 to pick up trash."}
