Michele Bachmann calls \u201cthe most consequential female\u201d in public policy in the last 50 years is taking on the feminist movement and its liberal allies again, charging they and their policies are responsible for the decline of the family in America.\n\nPhyllis Schlafly, known for spearheading the defeat of the Equal Rights Amendment, takes the fight to the left in a new book titled \u201cWho Killed the American Family.\u201d Described as the most personal book she\u2019s written, it explains how changes in the law, court decisions, education, entertainment and culture in general have eroded an essential building block of society.\n\n\u201cThe American family was destroyed by a combination of political activists, judges, economic theorists, self-proclaimed experts, and left-wing politicians \u2013 with different motives that produced the same result,\u201d Schlafly writes in the first chapter.\n\nThat\u2019s the short answer, and she goes into greater detail in the rest of the book. To those familiar with Schlafly\u2019s work, it will come as no surprise that she lays much of the blame for the death of the American family on radical feminists.\n\n\u201cThat attitude is not compatible with marriage and motherhood, and it does not produce happiness,\u201d Schlafly writes.\n\nBachmann noted she came to know about Schlafly \u201cwith all of the work she was doing on nearly every topic,\u201d including her successful fight against the Equal Rights Amendment.\n\nSoon the congresswoman obtained her copy of \u201cThe Phyllis Schlafly Report.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was so thrilled,\u201d she said.\n\nShe credits Schlafly for being part of the movement that gave rise to Ronald Reagan\u2019s presidency and the ultimate downfall of the Soviet Union.\n\nAnother killer of the American family in Schlafly\u2019s eyes is no-fault divorce, which she refers to as \u201cunilateral divorce.\u201d Women initiate two-thirds of all divorces, according to Schlafly, because they know they will usually get full custody of their children and a steady stream of child-support money from their ex-husbands.\n\nAttacked, debased, maligned and vilified: This foundational institution is fighting for its life. Order Phyllis Schlafly\u2019s bran new book, \u201cWho Killed the American Family?\u201d\n\n\u201cWives who had tired of marriage and its obligations discovered that they could divorce with or without any reason, keep the kids and most of their ex-husbands\u2019 income, and live a life free from marriage obligations,\u201d she wrote.\n\nSchlafly also writes about the tyranny of family courts, which she believes deny countless children access to their fathers through unnecessary restraining orders. She blasts family court judges for overruling the wishes of parents.\n\n\u201c[F]amily courts cling to the idea that a judge can act as a philosopher-king and decide what is in the best interest of a child,\u201d she writes. \u201cThis cannot be done without punishing parents and others for acts that are not contrary to any laws, rules, regulations, or policies that are written anywhere.\u201d\n\nThe book includes is a lengthy discussion on the perverse incentives in the tax code and welfare state that discourage stable families. Schlafly reiterated this point during a recent interview with WND.\n\n\u201cThe welfare system is giving handouts to promote women having children without husbands,\u201d she said. \u201cIf they don\u2019t have husbands, they\u2019re going to look to Big Brother government, and we don\u2019t want Big Brother government to be supporting our families.\u201d\n\nSchlafly some harsh words for the parenting \u201cexperts,\u201d such as psychiatrists, judges and social workers who claim to know a child\u2019s \u201cbest interests\u201d better than the child\u2019s parents.\n\n\u201cIt used to be that when a mom had a ten-year-old boy who was \u2018a bundle of uncontained energy,\u2019 the dad would teach him to play football or work on the farm to burn up that energy and make a man out of him. But now our society has convinced this mom to kick out her husband, drug the boy, and let him get fat and lazy,\u201d she writes.\n\nLiberals often claim there is a Republican \u201cwar on women\u201d in America, but Schlafly disagrees. Instead, she writes in her book of a war on men \u2013 young boys, college men and especially fathers. She believes the feminist agenda is all about subordinating men.\n\nThe bottom line is that the traditional nuclear family must be restored if the United States is to have a limited government, she contends. When parents are unable to provide for their children, it becomes the government\u2019s responsibility to care for them. This necessitates increased government spending, which leads to greater deficits.\n\n\u201cDo you want Congress to cut taxpayer spending and balance the federal budget?\u201d Schlafly asks in the final chapter. \u201cDo you want to restore our traditional system of limited government, created by the Founding Fathers so that Americans can live in freedom without supervision by an intrusive government? No way can any of that happen unless we restore the nuclear family as the lifestyle of the majority of Americans.\u201d\n\nAttacked, debased, maligned and vilified: This foundational institution is fighting for its life.
