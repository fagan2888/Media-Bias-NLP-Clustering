The streets near City Hall were packed with thousands of people enjoying Meridian Mardi Gras. The event kicked off with the annual parade. Hundreds lined the streets to get their hands on some beads and other goodies.

“I’m having fun just wandering around and looking at the buildings again. I mean, you live here all your life and you don’t really look at them,” Mardi Gras-goer Kelly Reed says.

A live band provided music, and there wasn’t a shortage of places to eat or shop. Local vendors used this opportunity to show off their merchandise. The entire day was fun for the whole family.

“It’s a lot of fun. There’s a lot of food. A lot of people out here. I like it,” Mardi Gras-goer Jeffrey James says.

Event organizers are excited with the turnout of this year’s Meridian Mardi Gras festivities.

“Just can’t express enough gratitude to the city of Meridian and Community Development for partnering with us and letting us put this on,” Meridian Mardi Gras Committee chair Will Hayes says. “We also want to thank other business who have contributed to make this happen.”

Hayes says Meridian Mardi Gras has been growing over the last several years and believes it is getting bigger and better.

“A fun family event for everyone in the city of Meridian and surrounding areas, and I think we’ve succeeded at that. We just hope to make it better every year and it has been this way so far,” Hayes says.

With Meridian Mardi Gras falling on Feb. 14, some were confused on how to celebrate.

“I couldn’t decide if it’s Mardi Gras or Valentine’s Day, so that’s why you get this right here,” Reed says, pointing to her beads and heart-shaped sunglasses.
