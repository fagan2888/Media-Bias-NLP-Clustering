On yesterday’s episode of the Fox Business Network’s “Cavuto: Coast-to-Coast,” Justin Danhof of the National Center for Public Policy Research criticized Tim Cook’s handling of Apple. Danhof, the Director of the Center’s Free Enterprise Project, was especially critical of Cook’s diversion of resources away from core business to products that aren’t popular and to political issues like the environment.
