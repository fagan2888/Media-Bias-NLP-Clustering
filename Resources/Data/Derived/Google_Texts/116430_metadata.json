They\u2019re part of a special class of Medicare hospital that, according to a 1997 law, must be at least 35 miles from any other hospital (or 15 miles in mountainous terrain), have 25 or fewer beds, offer a maximum stay of 96 hours, and have a 24-hour emergency room.\n\nWithout the program\u2019s cost-based reimbursements, many of these hospitals wouldn\u2019t be able to sustain operations. They\u2019re simply too remote, and their populations too small, to function with standard Medicaid and Medicare reimbursements. They don\u2019t benefit from the economies of scale that their urban counterparts do, their patient counts are lower, and their operational costs are higher by proportion.\n\nTo make matters worse, recent changes in healthcare have hit CAHs hard, creating pressure to reduce inpatient stays and drive patients toward less costly (and less profitable) outpatient care. The decision by 23 states not to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act has strained the budgets of small hospitals in those states.\n\nFurthermore, with the 2013 recommendation by the Office of the Inspector General that program requirements for CAHs be tightened, the designation that helps ensure the survival of these hospitals is under threat. Some experts now predict that 20 percent of these hospitals will close by the year 2020.\n\nBecause of these tough economic realities, it\u2019s crucial that CAHs improve their efficiency and find better ways to serve their communities. Now more than ever, the financial health of CAHs and the health of the populations they serve depend on facility design that maximizes operational efficiency and reins in costs.\n\n\n\nMaximizing staff efficiency with smart adjacencies\n\nPayroll typically accounts for 50 percent or more of hospital budgets, so efficient use of staff time is a critical component of a CAH\u2019s finances. Efficiency can be improved through designs that create smart adjacencies and shared nurses\u2019 stations, which allow nurses to oversee multiple departments during less busy times.\n\n\u201cOne reason we designed our new facility the way we did is to optimize staffing,\u201d says Julie Slagle, head of nursing at Sidney Regional Medical Center in Sidney, Neb.\n\nSidney is a town of 7,000 in the Nebraska panhandle, about three hours from Denver. A 25-bed replacement hospital is currently under construction there, the design of which will greatly increase efficiency and quality of care.\n\n\u201cThe facility we\u2019re in now is older and over the years has had a lot of departments added onto it. What ends up happening is, it becomes a lot of long hallways, a lot of walking space, and a lot of inefficiencies,\u201d Slagle says.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s say I\u2019m a nurse. A patient is being admitted, and I need to take him for an X-ray, labs, and then to his room. Right now, I\u2019m going to have to walk down two hallways to get to admissions, get the patient, take the elevator down a floor, walk down the hallway to the lab, then back to the elevator, go up, and then walk directly back to the area above the lab, which is radiology, for an X-ray. Then it\u2019s another 150 feet down a hallway to his room.\u201d\n\nThe new design for Sidney places the nurses\u2019 station at a critical node in the hospital\u2019s circulation, giving nurses quick access to the inpatient, emergency, surgery, lab, pharmacy, radiology, and labor and delivery departments. \u201cEverything\u2019s right there,\u201d Slagle says.\n\nThis increased efficiency is allowing Sidney to grow. \u201cWe\u2019re actually not cutting [full-time equivalents]. At the same time that we\u2019re building this facility for efficiencies, we\u2019re also building staff,\u201d she says. \u201cAs our services grow, our utilization of services grows.\u201d\n\nIn the next year, Sidney will add two physicians, two physician assistants, and a full-time surgeon.\n\nAnd because of how the design anticipates growth, any future expansions to Sidney will be completed without adding more hallways.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "[page-title],[metatags-global-keywords-1],Remodel / Renovation,Rooms and Workspaces,Architectural Design Ideas,Construction,Engineering,Financial Matters,Building Ideas,Maintenance,Small hospitals,Design Ideas", "revisit-after": "1 day", "description": "[site-name],[site-mission]"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3362\"", "article_summary": "Click To View GalleryCritical Access Hospitals (CAHs) provide essential medical services to rural communities that otherwise would have little or no access to care.\nWithout the program\u2019s cost-based reimbursements, many of these hospitals wouldn\u2019t be able to sustain operations.\nThe decision by 23 states not to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act has strained the budgets of small hospitals in those states.\nAnd because of how the design anticipates growth, any future expansions to Sidney will be completed without adding more hallways.\nMaximizing staff efficiency with smart adjacenciesPayroll typically accounts for 50 percent or more of hospital budgets, so efficient use of staff time is a critical component of a CAH\u2019s finances."}
