The new program was inspired by the Affordable Care Act to help grow the workforce for our healthcare system. The college will feature a multi-disciplinary degree program that aims to train the students who will provide healthcare services.\n\nDeborah Helizer will be the dean of the new program which will go live in the fall of 2016. She says the study of public health and medicine wasn\u2019t separated, but for the past 100 years or so they\u2019ve been split apart.\n\n\"This brings them back together in a way that I think everyone believes this is the right way to go,\" Helitzer said. \"It\u2019s a very forward thinking approach.\"\n\nThe program is planning on incorporating experiential courses and students will work with health councils in communities across the state. The program offered two pilot population health classes this semester, and Helitzer said they were big hits amongst students.\n\nUNM will be the second university in the country to house a College of Population Health.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Local News", "description": "New Mexico will be home to the nation's first population health doctoral program.
