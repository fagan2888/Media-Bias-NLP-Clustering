Ted Cruz spilled across the Dordt College student center, filling every inch of floor space and crawling up two stairways. A little more than 7,000 people live in the city; at least 700 had crammed into the building. Grinning and thanking God, Rep. Steve King imagined what caucus night could be like if they and their neighbors turned out \u2014 really, really turned out.\n\n\u201cI want to build an America that looks like Sioux County looks,\u201d said King (R-Iowa). \u201cDo what Sioux County does and direct the destiny of the caucuses. You know you offset other parts of the state. Please, do that again.\u201d\n\nIn 2008 and 2012, the conservative northwest counties of Iowa helped push like-minded Republicans to caucus wins \u2014 but past Iowa, Mike Huckabee and Rick Santorum petered out.\n\nThis year, many voters in Sioux County are saying they have a candidate in Cruz (R-Tex.) who shares their views \u2014 and who, critically, has a campaign and resources to do more than win northwest Iowa, more than send the fruitless messages of past years to the national GOP. They think he could win the Republican nomination. And they are all the more emboldened that it is the establishment this year that has not been able to pick a front-runner.\n\n\u201cI love it,\u201d said Bob Vander Plaats, the evangelical organizer who chaired Huckabee\u2019s campaign in 2008, endorsed Santorum in 2012, then led colleagues at his Iowa Family Leader organization in an early endorsement of Cruz for 2016. \u201cThey have the problem on their side that we\u2019d had the last two cycles on our side. We had to rely so much on organic turnout with Huckabee and Santorum because we just didn\u2019t have the funding. This campaign has both the campaign resources and that organic support.\u201d\n\n[Trump says Cruz\u2019s Canadian birth could be \u2018very precarious\u2019 for GOP]\n\nHuckabee\u2019s Sioux County landslide in 2008 helped him demolish Mitt Romney. Santorum won the county four years later by 644 votes; he won statewide, after a recount, by just 34.\n\nIn those years, these Dutch-settled towns, where unemployment sank below 2 percent and church pews filled twice on Sundays, had prayed that the GOP would stick with a such a candidate all the way to the nomination. GOP voters had politely declined.\n\nCruz has promised to break that cycle. In 2015, when he wooed social conservatives, he frequently reminded them of how Santorum and Huckabee \u2014 and before that, Sioux County winners Gary Bauer and Pat Buchanan \u2014 won early then lost to a united establishment.\n\n\u201cD.C. knows if we\u2019re divided, then the moderate Washington candidate with all the money comes right through and wins the nomination with 26 percent of the vote,\u201d he told conservatives who gathered for a closed-door meeting in Northern Virginia last May.\n\nIn interviews here, the people tasked to win the caucuses for Cruz described how he made that pitch and sold himself as the conservative last man standing. Inside his Hull, Iowa, office, across the street from the first Pizza Ranch, state Sen. Randy Feenstra described his own search for a conservative who could win. On one wall of the office hung photos of Feenstra with George W. Bush; on another was a quote from the Dutch theologian Abraham Kuyper: \u201cWhen principles that run against your deepest convictions begin to win the day, then battle is your calling, and peace has become sin.\u201d\n\nThe battle did not go so well for Feenstra. It took him to Tim Pawlenty in the 2012 race and Scott Walker in this one \u2014 both were early dropouts.\n\n\u201cMy record stinks,\u201d he said.\n\nWalker\u2019s exit led to calls from every campaign, \u201cwhich was pretty neat,\u201d but it was Cruz who persuaded him to be a campaign co-chair in Sioux County.\n\n\u201cHe just \u2014 how do I say it? \u2014 has all the tools,\u201d Feenstra said. \u201cIt\u2019s different from the past. I jumped on because I looked at him as someone who could win Iowa then the general election.\u201d\n\nOne of the tools was money, and Cruz was not shy about that. By launching before any other presidential candidate, Cruz set a goal of dominating early fundraising \u2014 and then he talked about it. \u201cDo you know which candidate raised the most money out of all 16?\u201d he asked Rush Limbaugh in July. \u201cWe did.\u201d (He did, not including independent super PACs).\n\nAs he did in his stymied 2010 run for attorney general and his 2012 run for Senate, Cruz piled up cash to scare other conservatives out of the race. Huckabee and Santorum did not quit \u2014 both are running again in 2016. But some of their key staffers switched sides. In Sioux Center, and on other stops of his northwest-Iowa tour, Cruz was joined by former Iowa secretary of state Matt Schultz, Santorum\u2019s 2012 campaign chair, who explained to reporters why Cruz\u2019s campaign was \u201clike nothing we\u2019ve seen before.\u201d He was joined anew by Alice Stewart, a former spokeswoman for both Huckabee and Santorum, who explained why the campaign\u2019s resources could lock in Iowa.\n\n\u201cWe can launch an air, land and sea assault,\u201d Stewart said as the candidate shook hands and submitted to selfies.\n\nHuckabee and Santorum have fired on Cruz, with Huckabee insisting that a tape of Cruz telling a donor that ending gay marriage was not a \u201ctop three\u201d priority in a time of war is proof that Iowa\u2019s conservatives are guzzling snake oil.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to be the same whether I\u2019m in Marshalltown, Iowa, or Manhattan,\u201d Huckabee said on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe\u201d on Tuesday as he pushed through his own, lower-profile Iowa bus tour. \u201cI don\u2019t wake up every day with a new conviction based on the polls.\u201d\n\nHuckabee had been saying that for weeks, though \u2014 and Cruz had made the sale months before. Mick Snieder, a banker and former city councilman in bucolic Orange City, had balked at getting too involved in 2016. Then, the morning of the dual Supreme Court decisions that legalized gay marriage and prevented a major disruption of the Affordable Care Act, he heard Cruz speak in nearby Sheldon.\n\n\u201cJust about every Republican put out a statement condemning it, and a whole lot of those Republicans are celebrating those decisions,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cThey\u2019re popping champagne. Obamacare? They didn\u2019t want to deal with it. And they\u2019re thrilled with the gay-marriage decision.\u201d\n\nSnieder signed on right away. Other Cruz organizers had similar stories \u2014 all could describe exactly why this candidate, finally, could win after Iowa. Cruz\u2019s theory that a resolute conservative could turn out more voters than a \u201cmoderate\u201d made absolute sense.\n\n\u201cAfter Santorum lost, I did notice people not as excited about going to the polls,\u201d Snieder recalled. \u201cI remember asking a co-worker who he was going to support. He said his son was telling him, \u2018Just hold your nose and vote for Romney,\u2019 so he guessed he had to.\u201d\n\nConservatives like Snieder came to trust Cruz, and the old caucus winners simply couldn\u2019t buy into the argument. At the end of the third fundraising quarter, Santorum and Huckabee had raised just $1.1 million and $3.3 million, respectively, compared with Cruz\u2019s $26.6 million. As of early January, the only negative Cruz spot people were likely to hear was a radio ad from a pro-Huckabee super PAC, replaying the Cruz gay-marriage answer.\n\nStill, Cruz was using the ends of his speeches to warn people that \u201cmillions of dollars in TV ads, radio ads and mailers\u201d were coming, many targeted at him, all of them false.\n\n\u201cThose mailers make really good kindling in the fireplace,\u201d Cruz said in Sioux Center. \u201cThey light up fast.\u201d\n\nAfter Cruz\u2019s events, social conservatives were aware of the risk if they quit on Cruz.\n\n\u201cBen Carson is not a leader. He\u2019s too soft-spoken,\u201d said Al Teslaw, 81, a soybean farmer. \u201cI think Huckabee and Santorum have sort of fallen away.\u201d\n\nIn Sioux Center, before Cruz boarded the bus with his endorsers, King stuck around to explain the candidate\u2019s thornier positions. There had been a question about ethanol policy. It was skeptical, but to King\u2019s delight it was no dealbreaker.\n\n\u201cThe other candidates have drifted away in the polling,\u201d King said matter-of-factly. \u201cEverybody knows what they have to do.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Ted Cruz, Iowa, Iowa conservatives: Iowa evangelicals, donald trump, mike huckabee, rick santorum", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/daveweigel?fref=ts", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Voters on the right love the senator from Texas because of his views \u2014 and because they think he can actually win.", "title": "Ted Cruz promises conservative Iowa something it\u2019s never had: A nominee", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/ted-cruz-promises-conservative-iowa-something-its-never-had-a-nominee/2016/01/06/fdb88a24-b477-11e5-a842-0feb51d1d124_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2016/01/06/National-Politics/Images/GOP_2016_Cruz-0f136-3230.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "daveweigel"}, "description": "Voters on the right love the senator from Texas because of his views \u2014 and because they think he can actually win.", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/ted-cruz-promises-conservative-iowa-something-its-never-had-a-nominee/2016/01/06/fdb88a24-b477-11e5-a842-0feb51d1d124_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "Ted Cruz, Iowa, Iowa conservatives: Iowa evangelicals, donald trump, mike huckabee, rick santorum", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/daveweigel?fref=ts"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "eomportal-uuid": "fdb88a24-b477-11e5-a842-0feb51d1d124"}, "article_summary": "This year, many voters in Sioux County are saying they have a candidate in Cruz (R-Tex.)\nBy launching before any other presidential candidate, Cruz set a goal of dominating early fundraising \u2014 and then he talked about it.\n\u201cI want to build an America that looks like Sioux County looks,\u201d said King (R-Iowa).\nPlease, do that again.\u201dIn 2008 and 2012, the conservative northwest counties of Iowa helped push like-minded Republicans to caucus wins \u2014 but past Iowa, Mike Huckabee and Rick Santorum petered out.\nOther Cruz organizers had similar stories \u2014 all could describe exactly why this candidate, finally, could win after Iowa."}
