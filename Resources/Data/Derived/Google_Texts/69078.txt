Donna Powers: NH needs casinos



MY NAME is Donna Powers from Manchester.



I'm retired but still work. I worked for more than a year at the Seabrook Poker room as a table game dealer and now have worked at Rockingham Poker room for some months, giving me almost two years on the job. Working as a table pit dealer allows me to interact with the players, converse a bit and get to know people pretty well. I am a people person myself.

..

I am here today to share with you the reality of what will happen to us, the workers and our charitable gaming, if you don't pass this bill.



What I'm being told by the players is that they will no longer come here when Massachusetts gets its casino. They are asking, "Why would we come here and only bet $4 when we can go next door and bet what we choose to bet?''

..

This was the same question at both poker rooms from every player that was asked and others at the table who agreed with that statement.



Even increasing the max bet to $8, $10, even $15 won't make a difference. It simply comes down to freedom of choice.



These players are the state's bread and butter who keep us working and supporting the charities throughout the state. This will all go away. At least 90 percent of our current business will be lost. I feel it would also have a residual effect on all our gaming areas, like bingo, the lottery, scratch tickets, simulcast wagering, etc. If the players aren't here, they're not spending their money in New Hampshire.

..

It seems to me that those opposed think every player is a gambling addict. Well, that's just not true. I see it with my own eyes, and I see that the majority of players have their affordable limits and walk away when their limit is reached. I see it all the time. On the other side, I also see players take their winnings and walk away and not losing it back.

..

I really don't believe a casino would damage our family values. Families will continue to come here and enjoy the many great venues throughout the state, our beautiful mountains and the North Country during the winter as they have been doing all along and I see no reason why that would change.

..

Do the naysayers really think people will stop enjoying other lifestyle choices for themselves and their families and all of a sudden want to become casino gamblers and say to hell with everything else they enjoy doing here in New Hampshire? It's just silly to even contemplate such a change happening.

..

Please don't give any credibility to the fear-mongering being thrown at us. They are just words with no basis in fact. If they think that blocking a casino here will stop people from gambling, you couldn't be more wrong. We will be the big losers when they all drive to Massachusetts, taking their money with them. And the fact is that we will all lose our jobs and the charities will no longer be able to survive.

..

Another issue important to me: I also see how more bigger and better state liquor stores are being built making alcohol more accessible, and we know children get access to alcohol in many ways, along with family alcoholism, which definitely hurts family values.

..

So I don't understand why you have no problem proliferating more alcohol but won't have a casino in which no child would ever be allowed; yet you keep building more liquor stores because of the lucrative revenue they generate.

..

But some of you are worrying over one or two casinos? Really?



Fact: As of 2012, there are at least 39 states that have legal casino gaming. That's over half the country and obviously the majority have spoken.

..

Without passing this bill we will lose so much! This casino is at least what 75 percent of the constituents want. Remember the majority?



For all the positive aspects of this bill it will be a win-win legislative coup for all of us with saving charitable gaming, much needed revenue for the state, gainful employment and creating many more jobs. It's just another business that is simple but with great benefits for the state. Why would anyone not want that?

..

For people who live locally, common sense will tell you that they would rather go to a casino closer to home. The less travel the better and that's what they'll do - go to the closest one. So whether it will be Mass. or New Hampshire is up to you.

..

Please don't turn your backs to the charities along with mine, the management and other dealers' jobs and ignore what's in the best interest of all. Please do the right thing by us, the people.



Ms. Powers testified in favor of Senate Bill 113 last week. SB 113 would allow for two casinos in New Hampshire. This is an edited version of her testimony.
