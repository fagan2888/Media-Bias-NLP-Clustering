The motorcade was scheduled to leave for last year\u2019s White House Correspondents\u2019 Association dinner in less than 20 minutes. We had one chance to rehearse the president\u2019s closing sketch with the translator, \u201cLuther,\u201d who was played by the comedian Keegan-Michael Key. President Obama had no problem delivering his lines or pretending to go unhinged when talking about climate change deniers. \u201cI do actually get mad sometimes, you know,\u201d he said.\n\nThe problem was Luther. Each time Mr. Key, as the anger translator, began a new manic tirade, the president burst out laughing. Already dressed in his tuxedo for the evening, he glanced toward us, his staff, huddled in a corner of the room.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got to hold it together,\u201d Mr. Obama said. He said it again backstage a few hours later, this time using a comedy term for laughing in the middle of a scene. \u201cI have to make sure I don\u2019t break.\u201d\n\nHe pulled it off. Like other leaders before him, Mr. Obama has gamely played his part in the annual correspondents\u2019 dinner \u2014 the one on Saturday night, his eighth, will feature the comedian Larry Wilmore \u2014 and the large number of toasts, monologues and other comedic obligations that come with the world\u2019s most powerful gig.\n\nPart of what makes any presidential joke funny is the fact that the president is telling a joke. But this president has a talent for comedy \u2014 an impressive sense of timing and audience. His administration combined that talent with an understanding of a changing media landscape and the emergence of viral videos. Jokes became a real tool to move his agenda forward.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhen I began working for the White House in 2011, the most effective way to draw attention to even the most obscure policy issue was generally either an interview or a speech. There was no @POTUS Twitter account, no Facebook Live, no Snapchat. There was also no real evidence that, outside of the traditional Washington joke dinners, being funny could help a policy be taken seriously.\n\nA turning point came after a somewhat rocky fall of 2013. That was when, as the president later described it in his 2014 correspondents\u2019 dinner speech: \u201cWe rolled out HealthCare.gov. That could have gone better.\u201d\n\nBy March 2014, the health care exchanges were finally working, but most young people didn\u2019t seem to know that. Not enough of them were signing up. One solution, at least in part, was for President Obama to plug the site on the comedian Zach Galifianakis\u2019s online talk show \u201cBetween Two Ferns.\u201d The commander in chief sat between two ferns and listened as the comedian asked him, \u201cWhat\u2019s it like to be the last black president?\u201d before they got around to talking health care.\n\nThe day the \u201cFerns\u201d video appeared online it was viewed by 11 million people, and traffic to HealthCare.gov spiked 40 percent. Of course that video isn\u2019t the only reason the administration can now report that 20 million people are enrolled in insurance through the Affordable Care Act. But it certainly helped get the word out.\n\nSince then, the president has appeared on Marc Maron\u2019s podcast, guest-hosted a segment on \u201cThe Colbert Report\u201d and driven across the South Lawn of the White House with Jerry Seinfeld in a \u201963 Corvette.\n\nOf course, his most frequent target has been himself. He\u2019s made fun of everything from his hair going gray to his approval ratings going down. (This year they\u2019re going up, presenting an added challenge for the writers.) He\u2019s told jokes that set the tone for the year ahead. (2015: \u201cMy advisers asked me, \u2018Mr. President, do you have a bucket list?\u2019 And I said, \u2018Well, I have something that rhymes with bucket list.\u2019 \u201d) On occasions, he\u2019s used his comedic sensibility to tell some inconvenient political truths. (2013: Republicans agree that \u201cthey need to do a better job reaching out to minorities. And look, call me self-centered, but I can think of one minority they could start with.\u201d)\n\nThere are some topics no president, even a genuinely funny one, can joke about. National security is off limits. So are all but the gentlest mentions of the first family. Then there was the meeting in 2013 when, sitting on the surprisingly comfortable brown couches in the Oval Office, Mr. Obama\u2019s speechwriters suggested he talk about Republican senators in the style of Alicia Silverstone\u2019s character from \u201cClueless.\u201d Something like: \u201cSo then Mitch was talking with John who was talking with Lindsey who said that Rand and Ted were, like, talking?\u201d\n\n\u201cThis might be funny \u2026 if a professional comedian did it,\u201d the president said. We moved on.\n\nAnother joke he rejected involved the District of Columbia decriminalizing marijuana, a Rand Paul filibuster and a congressional debate on \u201cwhether or not the Taco Bell is still open.\u201d He let us pitch him on it, but in the end it proved too clunky and complicated.\n\nSign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, The Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.\n\nOn Saturday night, the president will deliver his final correspondents\u2019 dinner monologue. For weeks, writers in and outside the White House have submitted hundreds of jokes, and only a handful of my former colleagues know which 35 or 40 will make the final cut. A safe bet, however, is that at least a few of the president\u2019s one-liners will look back on the last eight years. He\u2019ll have plenty of material to work with \u2014 an economic recovery, Obamacare, rescuing the auto industry. It\u2019s unlikely \u201cstarring in viral videos\u201d will be high on the legacy list.\n\nBut I do think that presidential comedy has played a role in this chapter in American history. The bully pulpit has splintered. It\u2019s become harder than ever to get people\u2019s attention. And the White House has recognized what class clowns have known all along.
