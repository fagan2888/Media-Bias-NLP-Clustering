Her wife will be coming as well.\n\nMargie Winters taught at Waldron Mercy Academy until June of this year, when she was fired after parents complained about her same-sex marriage.\n\nThe gay-rights group Human Rights Campaign obtained the White House tickets for Winters and her wife Andrea Vettori, according to the Philadelphia Inquirer. The group has promoted the story of Winters and Vettori, releasing a video last week that uses them to pressure the Catholic Church to accept gay marriage. Current Catholic doctrine regards homosexual acts as sinful and defines marriage as between a man and a woman.\n\nIn the video, Winters reads a letter she wrote to Francis in July where she asks him to \u201cintervene on our behalf and countless other faithful Catholics so that we may not be condemned to live a life exiled from a church we so love and want to serve.\u201d (RELATED: Carson Defends Comments About A Muslim Being President With Shocking Dose Of Common Sense)\n\nPhiladelphia\u2019s archbishop, Charles Chaput, has defended Winters\u2019 termination as an act of \u201ccharacter and common sense.\u201d\n\nWinters isn\u2019t the first person invited to Francis\u2019s White House reception who appears to reflect White House opposition to Catholic teachings. Others invited to the private reception include gay Episcopalian bishop Gene Robinson, Catholic transgender activist Matteo Williams, and Sister Simone Campbell, a nun who lobbied for Obamacare\u2019s passage despite its provisions funding abortion and forcing Catholic organizations to provide birth control. (RELATED: The Vatican Isn\u2019t Happy About Obama\u2019s Guest List For The Pope)\n\nAn unnamed Vatican official has expressed displeasure with the Obama administration\u2019s guest list, saying they feared Francis would be photographed alongside dissidents in an apparent endorsement of their activities. The official also expressed displeasure that while so many dissidents were invited, nobody appears to represent America\u2019s anti-abortion movement, which has close ties to the Catholic Church.\n\nFollow Blake on Twitter\n\nSend tips to [email protected].\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
