Lawmakers have pushed forward on crafting trade promotion authority (TPA) legislation to streamline passage of any deals.\n\nJapanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is set to address Congress in April. His speech will likely also center on economic partnership between the U.S. and Japan.\n\nIn addition to trade, Pelosi noted her trip will focus on security cooperation and human rights, especially for women, workers and religious minorities.\n\nPelosi arrives in Cambodia on Saturday, along with Democratic Reps. Sander Levin (Mich.), Charlie Rangel (N.Y.) and Mike Thompson (Calif.), who all sit on the Ways and Means Committee, the primary panel responsible for international trade policy.\n\nOther lawmakers on the trip include Democratic Reps. Doris Matsui (Calif.), Dan Kildee (Mi.), Mark Takai (Hawaii), Anna Eshoo (Calif.) and Zoe Lofgren (Calif.), as well as with Republican Rep. Mike Fitzpatrick (Pa.).", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The trip includes stops in Cambodia, Myanmar, Korea, Vietnam and Japan.", "description": "The trip includes stops in Cambodia, Myanmar, Korea, Vietnam and Japan.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "rdfs": {"label skos": {"prefLabel": "Blog Briefing Room"}}, "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "The trip includes stops in Cambodia, Myanmar, Korea, Vietnam and Japan.", "title": "Pelosi heads trade-oriented trip to Asia", "url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/237290-pelosi-heads-trade-oriented-trip-to-asia", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/article_images/pelosi_getty.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-03-28T10:57:20-04:00", "type": "article"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2015-03-28T10:57-04:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/237290-pelosi-heads-trade-oriented-trip-to-asia", "dcterms.date": "2015-03-28T10:57-04:00", "dcterms.creator": "Elliot Smilowitz", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.language": "und", "author": "Jesse Byrnes", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": ",Nancy Pelosi,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-03-28T10:57:24-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-03-28T10:57:20-04:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/237290-pelosi-heads-trade-oriented-trip-to-asia", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "The trip includes stops in Cambodia, Myanmar, Korea, Vietnam and Japan.", "card": "summary", "title": "Pelosi heads trade-oriented trip to Asia"}, "dcterms.title": "Pelosi heads trade-oriented trip to Asia"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9fd6\"", "article_summary": "In addition to trade, Pelosi noted her trip will focus on security cooperation and human rights, especially for women, workers and religious minorities.\nThe trip includes stops in Cambodia, Myanmar, Korea, Vietnam and Japan, the latter two of which are among the dozen nations in the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) talks.\nADVERTISEMENT \u201cMembers are particularly interested in gaining further understanding of how the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement that is currently being negotiated will impact the region\u2019s markets and economies,\" Pelosi added.\nOther lawmakers on the trip include Democratic Reps.
