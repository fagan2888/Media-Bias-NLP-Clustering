It was then that the group\u2019s most bizarre behaviors took place: the street brawls, the women running topless through high schools, the forced breakups of Weatherman couples, the orgies. All of it was designed to transform Weatherman\u2019s five hundred or so core followers into the makings of JJ\u2019s dream: an \u201curban fighting force\u201d to rally the working class toward revolution. Almost everything that happened that summer and fall, in fact, was designed in some way to \u201ctoughen up\u201d a band of coffeehouse intellectuals whose only experience with actual violence, other than watching The Battle of Algiers, was throwing the occasional rock during a street demonstration. \u201cWe have one task,\u201d Bill Ayers announced at meeting after meeting, \u201cand that is to make ourselves into tools of the revolution.\u201d The idea wasn\u2019t to go underground\u2014not yet, anyway. For the moment, the focus was to be on recruiting, violent street demonstrations, and, come the fall, the Days of Rage in Chicago.\n\nFew outside Weatherman itself thought that any of this, especially the Days of Rage, made much sense. When Mark Rudd met with leaders of the group that organized the largest mass protests of the era, the National Mobilization Committee\u2014the \u201cMobe\u201d\u2014they adamantly refused to join forces, arguing that street fighting and battling police were counterproductive. The Panthers too thought the Days of Rage a bad idea. The Chicago Panthers\u2019 charismatic young leader, Fred Hampton, held shouting matches with Dohrn and other leaders; the Panthers refused to help, and Hampton actually went public with his opposition, calling the Days of Rage \u201cCusteristic.\u201d\n\nInside Weatherman, especially in its male-dominated upper reaches, the surest way to lose face was to share these doubts. JJ set a macho tone, and a number of those who trailed in his wake, including Bill Ayers, Terry Robbins, and Howie Machtinger, were short young men who seemed to compensate by adopting fa\u00e7ades of arrogant swagger, scoffing at anyone who dared question Weather dogma; several of them had begun carrying guns. When Rudd made the mistake of questioning the Days of Rage, Ayers and Robbins snorted. \u201cHow could you succumb to that liberal bullshit?\u201d Robbins demanded. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to do it. It\u2019s the only strategy to build the revolution.\u201d As Rudd wrote later, \u201cThe scene plays in my memory like a grade-B gangster flick. Billy looks on in smirking contempt as Terry dismisses me with a flick of his ever-present cigarette. \u2018How could you be so weak?\u2019 That settled it.\u201d\n\nYet even those whom Weatherman most wanted to emulate, the leaders of revolutionary Cuba, had their doubts. The extent of Weatherman\u2019s ties to the Cuban government has been a source of speculation for more than forty years, the subject of multiple FBI investigations that ended up proving little. It is clear that several Weathermen, including Ayers, enjoyed contacts with Cuban diplomats in New York and Canada that would endure for years to come. The genesis of the relationship can be traced at least to the days immediately after Weatherman took control of SDS, when Dohrn led a group, part of a larger delegation of protesters, in an extended visit to Havana. The Cubans treated Dohrn like visiting royalty, featuring her in government magazines and introducing her to dignitaries from throughout the revolutionary world. The highlight of the visit was a meeting with a delegation from North Vietnam, which seemed far more eager to discuss formation of a Viet Cong\u2212style underground in America than half measures like street fighting. Their message was mixed: Even as they lectured Dohrn on ways this underground could be formed, they cautioned her \u201cabout not getting too far ahead of the masses,\u201d in Mark Rudd\u2019s words, which was exactly what Weatherman was doing. In the end, after giving the Weathermen rings forged from the metal of downed U.S. fighter planes, a North Vietnamese delegate simply urged the Weathermen to do their best. \u201cThe war is entering its final phase,\u201d he told Dohrn. \u201cYou must begin to wage armed struggle as soon as possible to become the vanguard and take leadership of the revolution.\u201d\n\nBack in the United States, JJ and the other new SDS leaders were already preparing the ground. Within days of their convention victory, detachments of Weathermen, more than two hundred in all, began arriving in cities across the country: thirty in both Seattle and New York; twenty-five in Columbus, Ohio; fifteen in Denver; plus smaller groups scattered throughout the Midwest, in Detroit, Pittsburgh, Milwaukee, Cleveland, and Cincinnati. In each, members lived together in \u201ccollectives.\u201d The leadership, based in Chicago and now known as the Weather Bureau\u2014JJ, Rudd, Ayers, Jeff Jones, and others\u2014traveled among them, leading the collectives in increasingly outlandish protests aimed at rallying the working class, to whom they referred as \u201cgreasers\u201d or, more commonly, \u201cthe grease.\u201d Their most common tactic was a series of \u201cinvasions\u201d they mounted of blue-collar high schools and community colleges, in which Weathermen ran through the halls screaming and urging students to join them at the Days of Rage. In August, in the Detroit suburb of Warren, a group of Weatherwomen took over a classroom at Macomb Community College during exams and lectured the thirty or so confused students on the evils of racism and imperialism; when the teacher called the police, the Weatherwomen were arrested. A month later, in Pittsburgh, twenty-six Weatherwomen stormed the halls of South Hills High School, tossing leaflets, waving a North Vietnamese flag, and, when this didn\u2019t sufficiently engage male students, lifting their skirts and exposing their breasts. Once again, most of the Weatherwomen ended up in jail.\n\nAll through July, August, and into September, Weathermen led similar protests around the country, brawling with PLers in Boston and New York and fighting with police in Seattle and in Detroit, where on September 27 JJ led a march of sixty Weathermen that turned violent, the protesters pelting police with rocks and bottles. These actions were successful insofar as they boosted morale in the ranks and created a sense that Weatherman was actually \u201cdoing something.\u201d The problem, it soon became apparent, was that, for all the effort, Weatherman wasn\u2019t finding much of anyone in the \u201cworking class\u201d who wanted to join its revolution. In several cases its representatives ended up in shoving matches with the very people they were trying to befriend. When Mark Rudd tried to recruit a band of tough-looking teens at a Milwaukee hamburger joint, they beat him so badly he had to be hospitalized.\n\nRudd, in fact, though he was still the symbol of SDS to many, was proving a less-than-inspiring leader. A telling snapshot, offered in Kirkpatrick Sale\u2019s SDS, came during his appearance at Columbia on September 25, in a speech in which he implored the audience to prepare for the revolution. \u201cI\u2019ve got myself a gun\u2014has everyone here got a gun?\u201d Rudd all but sneered. \u201cAnyone? No? We-e-ll, you\u2019d better fuckin\u2019 get your shit together!\u201d When a non-Weatherman SDSer named Paul Rockwell approached the stage, insisting he had heard enough, Rudd took two menacing steps toward him. Rockwell barreled into Rudd and slammed him into the podium, at which point Rudd simply shrugged and slunk to one side of the stage. \u201cRudd\u2019s face was a picture of stunned fear,\u201d Sale wrote, \u201call his rhetoric having done nothing to overcome his ingrained middle-class unfamiliarity with, and anxiety about, violence.\u201d\n\nRudd could see his stock falling. With every passing day, power and influence were passing to the more aggressive leaders, Jeff Jones, Terry Robbins, and especially Bernardine Dohrn, who, as the leadership\u2019s sole female, seemed to hold every other Weatherman leader in thrall. \u201cPower doesn\u2019t flow out of the barrel of a gun,\u201d Rudd snarled at Dohrn during one Weather Bureau meeting. \u201cPower flows out of Bernardine\u2019s cunt.\u201d\n\nThe heart of Weatherman\u2019s work remained in Chicago, where the leadership and their friends lived together in groups of five and six. The brutality they experienced there\u2014especially from the Chicago police but also from others\u2014would have a powerful impact on their eventual decision to go underground. One of Jeff Jones\u2019s friends, Jonathan Lerner, was given control of the national office, a set of second-story rooms at 1608 West Madison, on the edge of a ghetto. Lerner\u2019s tiny staff paid the bills, answered mail, and put out the SDS newspaper, New Left Notes. \u201cThe office was a terrifying place,\u201d Lerner recalls. \u201cThe presence of the cops was constant, sitting outside, following us to the bank. We were under siege by this group of black boys, ten, eleven years old. They would come up the fire escapes, race through, and steal people\u2019s purses. It was absurd. Eventually we boarded up all the windows to keep the kids out, put deadbolts on all the doors, and built a metal cage like an airlock to get in. None of it helped.\u201d\n\nAnother danger, though the leadership never publicized it, was the Panthers, whose offices were several blocks away. If SDS was a focus of police harassment, the Chicago Panthers were approaching open war with the police. Their derelict offices were regularly raided, their members stopped and frisked on an hourly basis. The Weathermen idolized the Panthers, but the relationship fast deteriorated. \u201cThe Panthers were in a stage of total madness,\u201d recalls Lerner. \u201cAs those months went on, as they became more paranoid and more crazy, they kind of took it out on us. To them our offices were much bigger, much nicer than theirs, we had lots of equipment, and cars, and the printing press. It rapidly developed into this rip-off relationship. That was emotionally horrible. You couldn\u2019t dare question it politically. It was completely insane.\u201d Tensions climaxed when a group of Panthers stormed the SDS office, jammed a gun into a girl\u2019s face, beat up the SDS printer, Ron Fliegelman, and ransacked the office, making off with typewriters and other equipment. Afterward, Bernardine Dohrn and others went to the Panther offices to complain, Lerner recalls, \u201cand were basically kicked down the stairs.\u201d\n\nFor all the threats of political violence, however, the emotional violence Weathermen unleashed among themselves proved even more destructive. Throughout this period, the Weather Bureau issued a series of directives designed to mold every individual Weatherman\u2014or \u201ccadre\u201d\u2014into a revolutionary combatant. The most grueling of these practices, borrowed from the Maoist Chinese, was known as criticism/self-criticism, essentially a marathon all-night interrogation in which members were accused of every conceivable human weakness, from cowardice to insubordination. For many, these sessions were too much; dozens of Weathermen left the group as a result. This was the point: to weed out the weak and the unready, to break down all traces of individualism and transform the deponent into a tough, obedient, unquestioning soldier. Another initiative, which actually originated with a group of Detroit Weatherwomen, was the Smash Monogamy program, which ordained that every member of Weatherman break up with his or her romantic partner. The idea, again, was to sever individual Weathermen from every meaningful relationship except that with the group itself. Scores of Weather couples were forced to break up, though it was noted that Dohrn always seemed exempt; while she and JJ did break up during this period, Dohrn began an extended monogamous relationship with Jeff Jones.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Organizing, orgies, escalating violence\u2014it all climaxed for the Weathermen at the Days of Rage in Chicago in '69", "author": "Bryan Burrough", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Organizing, orgies, escalating violence\u2014it all climaxed for the Weathermen at the Days of Rage in Chicago in '69", "title": "\u201cEveryone who considers himself a revolutionary should be armed\u201d: Bill Ayers, the Weathermen and the Days of Rage", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/04/11/everyone_who_considers_himself_a_revolutionary_should_be_armed_bill_ayers_the_weathermen_and_the_days_of_rage/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/04/chicago_demonstration.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Organizing, orgies, escalating violence\u2014it all climaxed for the Weathermen at the Days of Rage in Chicago in '69", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/04/chicago_demonstration.jpg", "title": "\u201cEveryone who considers himself a revolutionary should be armed\u201d: Bill Ayers, the Weathermen and the Days of Rage", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "\u201cEveryone who considers himself a revolutionary should be armed\u201d: Bill Ayers, the Weathermen and the Days of Rage", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, '60s, Bill Ayers, Books, days of rage, Mark Rudd, SDS, sixties, Weathermen", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd05cb\"", "article_summary": "When Rudd made the mistake of questioning the Days of Rage, Ayers and Robbins snorted.\nFew outside Weatherman itself thought that any of this, especially the Days of Rage, made much sense.\nFor the moment, the focus was to be on recruiting, violent street demonstrations, and, come the fall, the Days of Rage in Chicago.\nThe Panthers too thought the Days of Rage a bad idea.\nTopics: '60s, Bill Ayers, Books, days of rage, Mark Rudd, SDS, sixties, Weathermen, Politics NewsWhile the FBI and Chicago police looked on, the new Weatherman leaders of SDS embarked on an uproarious six-month period, the second half of 1969, that would come to define them."}
