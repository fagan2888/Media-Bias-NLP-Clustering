Critics said the videos essentially showed the organization negotiating the sale of fetal body parts, even as Planned Parenthood has repeatedly denied wrongdoing and alleged the videos were heavily edited to mislead.\n\nThe controversy sparked a 248-177 vote in the GOP-controlled House on Friday that stripped the group of funding for one year while congressional investigations are conducted, but Republicans are unlikely to muster the 60 votes needed to get the bill across the finish line in the Senate or override a promised veto by President Barack Obama.\n\nNow some conservative lawmakers insist that it\u2019s time to up the ante and attach a defunding provision to a broader budget bill that is required to keep the government open past Oct. 1, even if it provokes a shutdown standoff with the president.\n\nRep. Mick Mulvaney, R-S.C., has been circulating a letter, co-signed so far by 31 of his House Republican colleagues, emphasizing that they will not support any funding legislation that includes federal money for Planned Parenthood.\n\n\u201cIt is imperative that Congress do everything within its power to investigate these reports and take immediate action to stop them,\u201d the letter read. \u201cIn the meantime, we must act to fully defund Planned Parenthood. Please know that we cannot and will not support any funding resolution \u2014 an appropriations bill, an omnibus package, a continuing resolution or otherwise \u2014 that contains any funding for Planned Parenthood, including mandatory funding streams.\u201d\n\nMany Republican lawmakers, however, worry over another disaster for the party if they lead a charge to shutter the government with no exit strategy in place to force Obama\u2019s hand. The last government shutdown resulted in the Republican Party\u2019s image taking a beating and the Affordable Care Act still in place, although the GOP managed to win control of the Senate in the 2014 elections.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell last month called pursuing a shutdown \u201can exercise in futility.\u201d \u201cThe honest answer of that is that\u2019s not going to happen until you have a president who has a similar view,\" he told Politico earlier this month.\n\nSen. Kelly Ayotte, R-N.H., who is up for re-election in 2016, has urged Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, who has advocated for the shutdown tactic to defund Planned Parenthood, to lay out his endgame, noting that his 2013 attempt to strip funding from the Affordable Care Act was ultimately unsuccessful.\n\n\u201cWhat is your strategy to succeed in actually defunding Planned Parenthood? How do we get 60 votes? And if for some reason there were 60 votes, how do we get 67 votes in the Senate to overcome a presidential veto?\u201d she wrote in a letter addressed to Cruz on Friday. \u201cDuring the last government shutdown, I repeatedly asked you what your strategy for success was when we did not have the votes to achieve the goal of defunding Obamacare, but I did not receive an answer. I am again asking this question and would appreciate you sharing your strategy for success with all of us before any damaging government shutdown becomes imminent.\u201d\n\nSome lawmakers also argue that provoking a shutdown would damage the party before the 2016 elections and make it less likely that an anti-abortion Republican candidate will be elected president.\n\n\"There are some in the House who are using serious governance issues to score cheap political points against the speaker,\" said Rep. Charlie Dent, R-Pa., told The Associated Press. \u201cShutting down the government is not in our political interest. It will undermine the Republican brand, and it will hurt whoever the Republican nominee is in November.\u201d\n\nPlanned Parenthood provides health services to approximately 3 million people annually, including treatment for sexually transmitted diseases, cancer screenings and contraceptives, according to the organization\u2019s most recent annual report. Abortions constitute 3 percent of services provided by Planned Parenthood branches. An estimated 41 percent of the organization\u2019s revenue is derived from government sources.\n\nPresident Barack Obama has urged his political opponents to come to reason. \u201cWhat\u2019s not the right thing to do, what makes no sense at all, is Congress threatening to shut down the entire federal government if they can\u2019t shut down women\u2019s access to Planned Parenthood. That\u2019s not a good idea,\u201d he said Saturday in a speech to the Congressional Black Caucus. \u201cCongress should be working on investing things that grow our economy and expand opportunity and not get distracted and inflict the kind of self-inflicted wounds that we\u2019ve seen before on our economy.\u201d\n\nStill, those urging the Republican Party to pursue the most aggressive strategy possible to defund Planned Parenthood said the fight is substantively different from the 2013 battle to repeal the Affordable Care Act. More Americans are learning about Planned Parenthood\u2019s unsavory practices by way of the undercover videos, said Mallory Quigley, a spokeswoman for the Susan B. Anthony List, an anti-abortion advocacy organization, and the debate is one that favors the GOP.\n\n\u201cThe Republican Party needs to show that they stand on principle and they will push to get something done,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd if you look at the electorate right now, they\u2019re not in mood for business as usual.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Some conservative lawmakers want to tie defunding provision to budget bill needed to keep government open past Oct. 1", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.aljazeera.simple", "og": {"url": "http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2015/9/21/planned-parenthood-fight-could-spark-shutdown.html", "image": {"width": 1460, "identifier": "http://america.aljazeera.com/content/ajam/articles/2015/9/21/planned-parenthood-fight-could-spark-shutdown/jcr:content/headlineImage.adapt.1460.high.defund-pp.1442859657751.jpg", "height": 911}, "type": "article", "description": "Some conservative lawmakers want to tie defunding provision to budget bill needed to keep government open past Oct. 1", "title": "Congress hurtles toward shutdown fight over Planned Parenthood funds"}, "LastModifiedDate": "Mon, 21 Sep 2015 18:22:12 GMT", "twitter": {"site": "@AJAM", "image": "http://america.aljazeera.com/content/ajam/articles/2015/9/21/planned-parenthood-fight-could-spark-shutdown/jcr:content/headlineImage.adapt.1460.high.defund-pp.1442859657751.jpg", "description": "Some conservative lawmakers want to tie defunding provision to budget bill needed to keep government open past Oct. 1", "card": "summary", "title": "Congress hurtles toward shutdown fight over Planned Parenthood funds"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=810543104, affiliate-data=10lxKx", "keywords": "Politics, Shutdown, Planned Parenthood, Congress, U.S.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Abortions constitute 3 percent of services provided by Planned Parenthood branches.\n\u201cIn the meantime, we must act to fully defund Planned Parenthood.\n\u201cThe Republican Party needs to show that they stand on principle and they will push to get something done,\u201d she said.\n\u201cWhat is your strategy to succeed in actually defunding Planned Parenthood?\n\u201cWhat\u2019s not the right thing to do, what makes no sense at all, is Congress threatening to shut down the entire federal government if they can\u2019t shut down women\u2019s access to Planned Parenthood."}
