That may mean less temporary employees than they would otherwise have.\" - Brian Usischon, UNC Associate Vice President for Human Resources\n\nKotis told Campus Reform that UNC Chief Operating Officer, Charlie Perusse, said universities will \u201clikely\u201d cut the hours of 75 percent of eligible employees in order to lower the cost of complying with the mandate to between $11-$22 million.\n\nPerusse confirmed the accuracy of the numbers in an interview with Campus Reform Monday morning.\n\nUNC\u2019s Associate Vice President for Human Resources Brian Usischon said he also wasn\u2019t sure how the universities would handle the costs, but offered job cuts as one example.\n\n\u201cCampuses are going to have to make changes to their business model,\u201d Usischon said in an interview with Campus Reform. \u201cThat may mean less temporary employees than they would otherwise have.\"\n\nThe $47 million number comes from the current cost of health insurance at UNC \u2014 for which the 2014 cost is $5,435 per employee, according to Kotis \u2014 but those rates may be even higher in 2015.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know what it will be next year,\u201d Kotis said in an interview Campus Reform. \u201cThey told me [it would cost] $5,200 [this year]; I asked for a chart of the history and it showed $5,450 or something. And by next year it could be $6,000 for all we know. So the number could be higher.\"\n\nHealth care costs have already risen 34 percent in the past seven years, according to Kotis. UNC is attempting to get approval to offer employees such as graduate and teaching assistants, temporary faculty, and student employees a cheaper plan.\n\nThe employees who qualify include graduate and teaching assistants, temporary faculty and student employees.\n\nFollow the authors of this article on Twitter @kctimpf and @SterlingCBeard", "article_metadata": {"category": "Exclusive", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://www.campusreform.org/img/CROBlog/5467/UNC1.jpg", "description": "Complying with Obamacare could cost the University of North Carolina system nearly $50 million next year, but it could cut employee hours to lessen the impact.", "og": {"site_name": "Campus Reform", "description": "Complying with Obamacare could cost the University of North Carolina system nearly $50 million next year, but it could cut employee hours to lessen the impact.", "title": "Obamacare costs may force UNC to cut hours for 6,500 employees", "url": "http://www.campusreform.org/?ID=5467", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://www.campusreform.org/img/CROBlog/5467/UNC1.jpg", "height": 600}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "image": "http://www.campusreform.org/img/CROBlog/5467/UNC1.jpg", "fb": {"admins": 19226500, "app_id": 127484367480}, "keywords": ",Universityof North Carolina,Obamacare,Affordable Care Act, Katherine Timpf and Sterling Beard", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/CampusReform", "description": "Complying with Obamacare could cost the University of North Carolina system nearly $50 million next year, but it could cut employee hours to lessen the impact."}, "twitter": {"description": "Obamacare costs may force UNC to cut hours for 6,500 employees", "card": "http://www.campusreform.org/img/CROBlog/5467/UNC1.jpg"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc6da\"", "article_summary": "That may mean less temporary employees than they would otherwise have.\"\n\u201cThat may mean less temporary employees than they would otherwise have.\"\nPerusse confirmed the accuracy of the numbers in an interview with Campus Reform Monday morning.\n\u201cCampuses are going to have to make changes to their business model,\u201d Usischon said in an interview with Campus Reform.\nUNC is attempting to get approval to offer employees such as graduate and teaching assistants, temporary faculty, and student employees a cheaper plan."}
