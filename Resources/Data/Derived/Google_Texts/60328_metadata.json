Valerie Everett, CC BY-SA 2.0\n\nThe brain is a curious beast. It can perform unbelievable feats with seemingly no information, but it\u2019s also fragile: The slightest misfire of neurons can wipe out entire speech capabilities or sensations of realness. Among its stellar abilities is a knack for recognizing language.\n\nThe Franklin Institute in Philadelphia\u2019s latest brain exhibit, Your Brain, involves an audio illusion that exploits the psychological effect of priming. When we hear or see something, it doesn\u2019t wash off our brains as if it were coated in Teflon. Sensory information is sticky. It keeps with us for a brief period of time, or longer, depending on how long we\u2019re exposed to the stimulus. An extreme but potent example is the Tetris effect: After hours and hours of fitting colored blocks next to one another, for the next few days suddenly the whole world respects those patterns.\n\nHere\u2019s the Franklin Institute\u2019s example:\n\nWhy It Works\n\nPriming underpins nearly all modern psychological research. Before its discovery in 1971, psychology had no way of getting inside people\u2019s heads. How do we know what others\u2019 natural tendencies are? Can we know? Without an understanding of priming, researchers must rely on people\u2019s raw behavior, without any thought or consideration for how the environment could be playing a role.\n\nWhen our brains take in information, the data first gets stored as an implicit memory. The catalog of implicit memories determines how we act as unconscious decision makers. We know how to pick up a pair of chop sticks and load platefuls of sushi into our mouths without any effort. Certain memories also go on to get stored as explicit memories. These involve retrieving stored information intentionally, such as which kind of sushi you normally order. Explicit memory takes effort. Implicit memory doesn\u2019t. Is it any wonder, then, that cases like the Tetris effect and the Franklin Institute\u2019s example are so powerful?\n\nPriming isn\u2019t limited to fun little examples of tricking your brain. It has profound implications for how we behave as moral actors. Priming can cause people to act more kind or malicious toward others. Give someone a box of candy, and they are more likely to extend kindness forward in their own lives. Interrupt them during an impassioned moment, and their implicit memory will favor negative thoughts and experiences later on.\n\nThe eminent psychologist Daniel Kahneman goes so far to assert bias influences just about everything we do. We can\u2019t step outside our own heads and observe the world as strangers, Kahneman explains, so the best the brain can do is rely on recent information and experience to form interpretations of the world.\n\nKahneman likes the simple, yet illuminating, example of \u201cAnn approached the bank.\u201d With no other information, the sentence conjures up a concrete idea of what Ann is doing. But if we now say \u201cThe boat glided gently down the river,\u201d how does \u201cAnn approached the bank\u201d now strike you? The power of priming lies in what your brain sees, but to which you still remain blind.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "audio, illusion, reveals, power, priming, brains, natural, tendency, make, things, stick", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "The information our brains take in isn't washed away once we're done with it, and our perception and behavior feel the effects.", "title": "This Audio Illusion Reveals Your Brain's Knack For Language", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/audio-illusion-reveals-power-priming-brains-natural-tendency-make-things-stick-292314", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/07/10/language.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The information our brains take in isn't washed away once we're done with it, and our perception and behavior feel the effects.", "title": "This Audio Illusion Reveals Your Brain's Knack For Language", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/audio-illusion-reveals-power-priming-brains-natural-tendency-make-things-stick-292314", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/07/10/language.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/07/10/language.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Science/Tech", "published_time": "2014-07-10T09:36:42-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-07-10T09:36:41-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "The information our brains take in isn't washed away once we're done with it, and our perception and behavior feel the effects."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fddd4f\"", "article_summary": "Interrupt them during an impassioned moment, and their implicit memory will favor negative thoughts and experiences later on.\nThe Franklin Institute in Philadelphia\u2019s latest brain exhibit, Your Brain, involves an audio illusion that exploits the psychological effect of priming.\nThese involve retrieving stored information intentionally, such as which kind of sushi you normally order.\nImplicit memory doesn\u2019t.\nThe catalog of implicit memories determines how we act as unconscious decision makers."}
