Many don\u2019t know they can only buy health insurance both on and off the insurance exchange between Nov. 15 and Feb. 15 unless they have a major life change like get married or find a new job.\n\n\u201cThe average consumer we\u2019re speaking with doesn\u2019t seem to know about the deadline. We\u2019re certainly trying to get the word out, though it\u2019s an uphill battle. We\u2019re stressing to our navigators that right now, education is just as important as enrollment,\u201d said Franco Ripple, spokesman for Epilepsy Foundation of Florida, South Florida\u2019s largest health navigator group. Navigators help would-be customers find policies.\n\nMany new consumers are also unaware that they could receive financial assistance to help pay their monthly premiums. Almost 1 million Floridians last year received a tax credit \u2014 more than 90 percent of those who enrolled.\n\nThe group is partnering with the nonprofit Enroll America to host events all week at various Miami Dade College campuses to target young, healthy adults. The health care law also allows children to stay on their parent\u2019s insurance until they turn 26.\n\nFor those signed up last year, coverage will renew automatically if they do nothing, but that may not produce the best result. The returning customers could miss out on lower-premium options and get stuck with outdated and possibly incorrect subsidies.\n\nThe majority of current enrollees, more than seven in 10, can find a lower premium plan at the same bronze, silver, gold or platinum level before tax credit by returning to shop, according to federal health officials.\n\nFlorida consumers also have more options to choose from this year as several new insurance companies, including the titan UnitedHealthcare, joined the market.\n\n\u201cFor returning customers, it pays to shop,\u201d said Health and Human Services spokesman Benjamin Wakana.\n\nWatch The Report\n\nJust under half of all Florida counties saw average premium increases in the 10 to 15 percent range. Some rural counties, particularly in agricultural areas west of Lake Okeechobee, and counties where senior citizens make up a significant portion of the population, saw the biggest increases in average premium costs for \u201csilver\u201d plans from 2014 to 2015.\n\nCritics say premium increases signal the Affordable Care Act isn\u2019t working, but health insurance rates have risen as much as 20 or 30 percent in recent years.\n\nAnd federal health officials noted that 85 percent of current Florida enrollees could obtain coverage for $100 or less after any applicable tax credits in 2015.\n\n(TM and \u00a9 Copyright 2014 CBS Radio Inc. and its relevant subsidiaries.
