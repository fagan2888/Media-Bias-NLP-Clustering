The politically loaded saga prompted dozens of lawsuits, split the appeals courts and raised questions about whether a secular, for-profit company could exercise religious rights.\n\nThe cases before the court deal with the for-profit camp of plaintiffs. Unlike nonprofit employers, for-profit companies have not been given any relief from the mandate and say they are presented with an impossible choice: either violate their beliefs or pay crippling fines for flouting the mandate.\n\nSEE ALSO: SANDEFUR: Hobby Lobby case\u2019s First Amendment backing\n\n\u201cThe administration has effectively told the Supreme Court that for-profit companies have no right to act on moral convictions the government opposes. They are about profits,\u201d Joshua Hawley, counsel for the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, wrote in a recent op-ed for USA Today. \u201cThat position is deeply mistaken.\u201d\n\nThe Supreme Court consolidated two cases for Tuesday\u2019s arguments, with each side chalking up a win at the circuit court level.\n\nHobby Lobby, an Oklahoma-based crafts supplies company, found favor before the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Denver last summer, but the government trumped Conestoga Wood Specialties \u2014 owned by Mennonites in Pennsylvania \u2014 before the 3rd Circuit in Philadelphia.\n\nSPECIAL COVERAGE: Health Care Reform\n\nIn the Pennsylvania case, \u201cthe court holds that corporations lack religious liberty rights, and the company\u2019s owners are not affected because they are not required to do anything under the contraception rule \u2014 the rule runs against the corporation,\u201d said Brigitte Amiri, a senior staff attorney at the American Civil Liberties Union, which has supported the government\u2019s position.\n\n\u201cThe 10th Circuit\u2019s decision answers the threshold question in the opposite manner \u2014 that corporations do have religious liberty rights and their owners\u2019 rights are implicated too,\u201d she said.\n\nNow, it\u2019s up to the justices to fulfill their role as the ultimate arbiter.\n\nThe questions before the court focus on two key areas \u2014 whether corporations have a constitutional right to the free exercise of religion, and whether a 1993 law backed by both parties in Congress and signed by President Clinton was designed to insulate religiously devout owners from laws and government mandates like President Obama\u2019s.\n\nThe circuit court decisions leading up to the Supreme Court arguments offer starkly different views of whether the religious rights and protections regularly afforded to individuals should extend to for-profit corporations.\n\nThe 10th Circuit pointed to Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission, the 2010 Supreme Court case that allowed corporations to spend millions of dollars on campaign advertising through super PACs, citing their rights to free speech.\n\n\u201cWe see no reason the Supreme Court would recognize constitutional protection for a corporation\u2019s political expression but not its religious expression,\u201d the majority wrote in the 10th Circuit decision.\n\nThe court also held that Hobby Lobby, owned by the Green family, should be shielded by the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 because it would be \u201csubstantially burdened\u201d by the government\u2019s mandate. The court said Congress did not appear to differentiate between individuals and for-profit entities when it enacted the law.\n\nMeanwhile, the Obama administration and its supporters have defended the rule as a women\u2019s health issue. They say an adverse ruling from the court would dramatically recast the extent to which secular for-profit entities can incorporate religious beliefs into their businesses operations.\n\n\u201cOur constitutional traditions have always recognized a basic distinction between religious bodies and secular business, even when, as in these cases, those businesses are operated by devout individuals,\u201d said David Gans, civil rights director at the Constitutional Accountability Center.\n\nThe outcome of the contest before the court is considered a tossup by many analysts. It is so hotly contested that even punctuation is playing a role.\n\nBefore the 3rd Circuit, Conestoga contended that the Citizens United case entitled it to greater protection because the First Amendment\u2019s clauses on free speech and the free exercise of religion are separated by a semicolon, suggesting continuity.\n\n\u201cWe are not persuaded that the use of a semi-colon means that each clause of the First Amendment must be interpreted jointly,\u201d the court wrote. \u201cIn fact, historically, each clause has been interpreted separately.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Obamacare is on the docket as the Supreme Court hears from corporate owners who say their personal beliefs should trump a government mandate that requires their company health care plans to insure birth control.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Obamacare is on the docket as the Supreme Court hears from corporate owners who say their personal beliefs should trump a government mandate that requires their company health care plans to insure birth control.", "title": "Supreme Court to weigh religious rights of corporations vs. Obamacare\u2019s \u2018contraception mandate\u2019", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/mar/23/supreme-court-to-weigh-religious-rights-of-corpora/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/03/23/3_232014_hobby-lobby8201.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/03/23/3_232014_hobby-lobby8201.jpg", "description": "Obamacare is on the docket as the Supreme Court hears from corporate owners who say their personal beliefs should trump a government mandate that requires their company health care plans to insure bir", "card": "summary", "title": "Supreme Court to weigh religious rights of corporations vs. Obamacare&"}, "Author": "Tom Howell Jr.", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Law Crime, Politics, Religion Belief, Supreme Court, Barack Obama"}, "article_summary": "\u201cThat position is deeply mistaken.\u201dThe Supreme Court consolidated two cases for Tuesday\u2019s arguments, with each side chalking up a win at the circuit court level.\nThe circuit court decisions leading up to the Supreme Court arguments offer starkly different views of whether the religious rights and protections regularly afforded to individuals should extend to for-profit corporations.\nThe politically loaded saga prompted dozens of lawsuits, split the appeals courts and raised questions about whether a secular, for-profit company could exercise religious rights.\n\u201cThe 10th Circuit\u2019s decision answers the threshold question in the opposite manner \u2014 that corporations do have religious liberty rights and their owners\u2019 rights are implicated too,\u201d she said.\nCircuit Court of Appeals in Denver last summer, but the government trumped Conestoga Wood Specialties \u2014 owned by Mennonites in Pennsylvania \u2014 before the 3rd Circuit in Philadelphia."}
