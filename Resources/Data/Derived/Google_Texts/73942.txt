PUEBLO, Colo. (AP) — A rocket launch company is opening a propulsion testing and manufacturing operation in Pueblo.

United Launch Alliance and Pueblo officials announced the opening Friday.

The Pueblo Chieftain reports (http://bit.ly/1LKac7Y ) that the operation will bring 34 jobs.

ULA was formed in 2006 as a joint venture of Lockheed Martin Space Systems and Boeing Defense, Space & Security. The company works on launch services for spacecraft.

Officials say the Pueblo project will include approximately $5 million in capital investment. The Pueblo propulsion testing and manufacturing operation will support the Vulcan rocket.

A total of $2 million from Pueblo’s half-cent sales tax fund for economic development will be invested in the project, pending approval from the city council.
