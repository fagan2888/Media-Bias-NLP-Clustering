It took effect Dec. 26.\n\nThe repeal bill, S.B. 6443, passed the Senate Committee on Commerce and Labor by a narrow 4-3 vote Thursday and now goes to the Rules Committee.\n\nState Sen. Doug Ericksen, R-Ferndale, sponsored the single-page bill, which states that the Human Rights Commission must repeal the rule and \u201cmay not thereafter initiate any rule-making procedure that involves the subject of gender-segregated facilities.\u201d\n\nIn the Washington House, H.B. 2935 is the companion bill.\n\nIn a summary of public testimony, the Commerce and Labor Committee reported that those who supported repeal said the new rule leaves people vulnerable to sexual predators. Those opposed to repeal argued that it would \u201callow for harassment and discrimination of transgender persons.\u201d\n\nThe Washington Coalition of Sexual Assault Programs released a statement Jan. 22 saying the repeal bill \u201cfails to recognize that the existing law already ensures public safety because when people have access to a bathroom consistent with their gender identity, safety is increased for all.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe were extremely disappointed to see the bill move out of the Senate and will remain engaged in our efforts to oppose this harmful repeal,\u201d Andrea Piper-Wentland, executive director of the group, told The Daily Signal.\n\nPeter Sprigg, a senior fellow for policy studies at the the Washington, D.C.-based Family Research Council, wrote an essay arguing that \u201cno government should be so irresponsible as to deliberately compromise its citizenry\u2019s safety and well-being in order to appease minority demands based on personal sexual preferences.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "State senators in Washington advanced the repeal bill by a 4-3 vote.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "State senators in Washington advanced the repeal bill by a 4-3 vote.", "title": "Lawmakers Move to Repeal Transgender Bathroom Mandate", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/160129_WashingtonTrans_Barillas.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-01-30T12:31:26+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1TrYfYL"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "State senators in Washington advanced the repeal bill by a 4-3 vote.", "creator": "@dailysignal", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/160129_WashingtonTrans_Barillas.jpg"}, "title": "Lawmakers Move to Repeal Transgender Bathroom Mandate", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Society", "tag": "individual freedom", "published_time": "2016-01-29T16:55:13+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-01-30T12:31:26+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "transgender, Washington, bathroom, Human Rights Commission, gender identity, Senate, Senate Committee on Commerce and Labor, Doug Ericksen"}, "article_summary": "The repeal bill, S.B.\nA bill to repeal a rule allowing transgender individuals in Washington state to use public bathrooms based on their gender identity has cleared a state Senate committee.\nIn a summary of public testimony, the Commerce and Labor Committee reported that those who supported repeal said the new rule leaves people vulnerable to sexual predators.\nThe Daily Signal reported previously that the state\u2019s Human Rights Commission approved the rule, which requires such access to sex-specific facilities including bathrooms and locker rooms.\n6443, passed the Senate Committee on Commerce and Labor by a narrow 4-3 vote Thursday and now goes to the Rules Committee."}
