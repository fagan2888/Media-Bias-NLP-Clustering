Because they\u2019re trying to rally their people to give money and show up in this year's elections.\n\n\"We have no plans to impeach the president. We have no future plans,\" Boehner added emphatically. \"Listen. It\u2019s all a scam started by Democrats at the White House.\"\n\nBoehner appeared to be referring to comments last week by senior White House adviser Dan Pfeiffer, who was asked about impeachment talk circulating in Washington, and said the administration expects that ultimately Boehner won't be able to resist appeals from his base to go after Obama.\n\nThe speaker is already launching a lawsuit against Obama, alleging that he has not enforced the Affordable Care Act vigorously enough. A resolution authorizing the suit is expected to get a vote by the full House this week.\n\nWhile there is talk on the right of impeaching Obama, so far the greatest impact of it has indeed been to help Democrats raise money. Earlier this month, Republican leaders also downplayed the chances of impeachment.\n\nUPDATE:This story has been updated to include a list of Republicans who have suggested impeachment.\n\nMichael McAuliff covers Congress and politics for The Huffington Post.
