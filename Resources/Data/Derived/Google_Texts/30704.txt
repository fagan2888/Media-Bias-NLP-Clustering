The number of Americans who need help putting food on the table is higher than ever. A staggering 47.6 million people received food stamps last year, equating to 15% of the American population.

What's causing the epidemic? The short answer is that both unemployment and, perhaps even more critically, the duration of joblessness remain elevated in the wake of the financial crisis.

The burden on the federal government reached a climax earlier this year with the passage of the latest farm bill. In an effort to reduce the cost, Congress changed how state program administrators calculate benefits for their residents.
