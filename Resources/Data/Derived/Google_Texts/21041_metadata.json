But 15 million of those people, by CFPB estimates, have no other dings on their credit. And debt collection agencies pursue fairly small medical debts: The average medical debt on a credit report is $579, and the median is just $207.\n\nThe scariest part? You may not know that you have a problem. \u201cMany, many people don\u2019t even know they have a bill\u2014much less that it\u2019s affecting their credit score,\u201d says Christina LaMontagne of NerdWallet.\n\nThe CFPB attributes part of the problem to a debt collection practice called \u201cparking.\u201d The federal agency says some debt collectors will ding the consumer\u2019s credit before even notifying the consumer that there\u2019s an outstanding medical bill. \u201cParking\u201d the debt where it can do the most damage motivates the person to pay it off quickly. Sometimes insurers ultimately pay the costs\u2014after a consumer\u2019s credit may have already suffered.\n\n\u201cThis is viewed by some collectors as a way to minimize costs, but it is not how the system is supposed to work,\u201d CFPB director Richard Cordray explained in a statement announcing the report. \u201cAnd the collection process should not depend on harming consumers by adverse reporting before a consumer even learns she owes a medical debt. If it takes a drop in her credit score or an adverse action notice to make the point, then even more damage has been done to her financial standing.\u201d\n\nEven if debt collectors haven\u2019t \u201cparked\u201d medical debt on your credit report, medical bills can be a vexing problem. Patients often struggle to learn the cost of their health care beforehand and understand their bills after the fact, LaMontagne says. A NerdWallet study found that 63% of Americans say they\u2019ve received unexpectedly high medical bills. And bills are often wrong: In an audit of Medicare claims, NerdWallet found that 49% contained errors, resulting in an average 23% overcharge.\n\nAs a result, one in five Americans may be contacted by a collection agency about medical debt this year, by NerdWallet\u2019s estimate. That\u2019s why all consumers should be on guard. Here\u2019s what to do to keep it from happening to you.\n\nControl costs\n\nOf course, the best way to avoid debt is to keep expenses low at the outset. But with medical costs, that\u2019s easier said than done. The most important thing? Stay in network.\n\n\u201cMost of the very high charges I see are for people who inadvertently saw out-of-network providers,\u201d LaMontagne says. \u201cPrint out the statement that says this doctor is in network and have that to protect yourself down the line.\u201d\n\nAlso, if you know you\u2019ll need a procedure like an MRI, shop around first. \u201cLeverage price transparency tools whenever possible,\u201d LaMontagne says. \u201cPeople do see huge variations in prices.\u201d\n\nSave for high deductibles\n\nWhile the Affordable Care Act has provided health insurance to an additional 10 million people, most Americans still get health coverage from their employers, and employers have been steadily raising deductibles, LaMontagne says. That means many consumers have to pay much more out of pocket before insurance covers the bulk of their costs. So more Americans may be hit with unexpectedly high bills.\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean high-deductible plans are bad, LaMontagne is quick to add. It just means people with these plans need to shop around for procedures and budget for health care expenses by setting aside money in tax-advantaged savings accounts like a health savings account (HSA).\n\nAsk for an itemized bill\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really hard to read a straight bill as they usually come in the mail,\u201d LaMontagne says. Luckily, you\u2019re entitled to an itemized one.\n\nWhen you get it, look for doctors and procedures you don\u2019t recognize. Compare the bill against your explanation of benefits from your insurer to see if your insurance has been applied correctly.\n\nIf you think there\u2019s a serious billing error, \u201ccall the doctor or call the insurance as your first line of defense,\u201d LaMontagne says. But when all else fails, you can seek help from a professional medical bill advocate.\n\nCheck your credit report\n\nOnce a year, you\u2019re entitled to a free credit report from each of the three credit bureaus: Experian, Trans\u00adUnion, and Equifax. So check every four months. Go to annualcreditreport.com to request your report. If you find an error, submit a dispute with the credit bureau.\n\nPay it off quickly\n\nThe good news: Fair Isaac, the company that creates FICO credit scores, announced earlier this year that medical debt will no longer drag down your credit score after it\u2019s been paid off. Consumers with median credit scores and no other debt can expect to see their FICO score increase 25 points after paying off an overdue medical bill that\u2019s been sent to collections.\n\nSo tackle medical debt quickly\u2014it can make a big difference.\n\nRead more:", "article_metadata": {"apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0", "description": "Almost 43 million Americans have overdue medical debt dragging down their credit, according to a new report from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "MONEY.com", "description": "A new report from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau finds that 52% of all debt on credit reports is medical debt.", "title": "The Debt You Don't Know You Have", "url": "http://time.com/money/3629764/medical-debt-cfpb/", "image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/141211_ff_debtnotknown.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/141211_ff_debtnotknown.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012"}, "title": "The Debt You Don't Know You Have", "description": "A new report from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau finds that 52% of all debt on credit reports is medical debt.", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "MONEY"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-tooltip": "Current & Breaking News | National & World Updates", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "p": {"domain_verify": "f48a8936c3fffc943fce516f2e3ff1d2"}, "fb": {"app_id": 53177223193}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/time2014/img/time-touch_icon_152.png", "application-name": "TIME", "google-site-verification": "nFxFQf8F4Xgg0b9Ap9rOUJzg7MY74LicbBIzsLo8yIg", "keywords": ", cfpb, consumer financial protection bureau, debt, debt collectors, fsa, health care, health insurance, healthcare, high deductibles, medical debt, paying off debt, savings", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/MoneyMagazine"}, "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://time.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/2cee445ea71a179ffd35ea91cf154905?s=16", "news_keywords": "cfpb, consumer financial protection bureau, debt, debt collectors, fsa, health care, health insurance, healthcare, high deductibles, medical debt, paying off debt, savings"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd44e5\"", "article_summary": "Even if you carry no debt on your credit card and pay your mortgage every month, another kind of debt might be ruining your credit: medical debt.\nAnd debt collection agencies pursue fairly small medical debts: The average medical debt on a credit report is $579, and the median is just $207.\nIf it takes a drop in her credit score or an adverse action notice to make the point, then even more damage has been done to her financial standing.\u201dEven if debt collectors haven\u2019t \u201cparked\u201d medical debt on your credit report, medical bills can be a vexing problem.\nCheck your credit reportOnce a year, you\u2019re entitled to a free credit report from each of the three credit bureaus: Experian, Trans\u00adUnion, and Equifax.\nAlmost 43 million Americans have overdue medical debt dragging down their credit, according to a new report from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau."}
