Tim Derickson of Hanover Township is The Enquirer editorial board\u2019s pick for John Boehner\u2019s former seat in Congress. (Photo: Provided)\n\nThe candidates to represent former House Speaker John Boehner\u2019s district skew both right and politically inexperienced \u2013 even moreso than in the once-crowded GOP presidential field.\n\nOne Democrat, one Green Party candidate and 15 Republicans are competing for the rare open seat in the far-flung, largely rural 8th Congressional District. Only two of the 17 hold elected office, although many of them have strong backgrounds of other kinds \u2013 in business, the military and other public service.\n\nThe winner will fill an important seat at a tumultuous time. Boehner, a West Chester resident, quit in the face of increasing pressure from the House Freedom Caucus, a group of about three dozen ultra-conservative congressmen who seek to govern by brinkmanship. The caucus sees the threat of government shutdowns as a legitimate tool to get its way on issues such as the Affordable Care Act, Planned Parenthood \u2013 really, wherever they hold a position they can\u2019t otherwise get past the Senate and/or President Obama.\n\nThis isn\u2019t how democracy is supposed to work, and it\u2019s vital to put a voice of reason in Congress \u2013 a leader who will be more interested in building coalitions than walls. Boehner was such a leader, and Southwest Ohio will feel his absence for years to come.\n\nThe Enquirer editorial board took a multilayered approach to evaluating the candidates for his replacement: We reviewed their written materials and responses to submitted questions. We co-hosted a candidate forum with several local chambers of commerce. Finally, we met with five \u2013 all Republicans \u2013 who appeared most promising: Ohio Sen. Bill Beagle, Ohio Rep. Tim Derickson and businessmen Warren Davidson, Jim Spurlino and Kevin White.\n\nMilitary vs. legislative experience\n\nEach was thoughtful in his positions and would bring unique experiences. At a time when our country is faced with so many foreign threats, Davidson and White have the benefit of military experience and the best understanding of the situation in the Middle East. Spurlino has demonstrated leadership in attacking important regional issues at the community level. Beagle and Derickson have legislative experience in Columbus and are highly attuned to the issues in Southwest Ohio.\n\nBut one candidate rose to the top of the GOP field \u2013 and, in fact, the entire field \u2013 as a leader who would put ego and talking points aside to end the logjam in Congress. That\u2019s Derickson, the state representative from Butler County\u2019s Hanover Township.\n\nIn the House, the 55-year-old has experienced life in the minority party as well as the majority party, and he has shown the ability to put partisan politics aside to advance his legislative agenda. Derickson has staked out a reputation as a someone who\u2019s both principled and capable of looking at the big picture, not merely short-term political gain.\n\nLegislating \u2013 whether in the Statehouse or in Congress \u2013 is not only about big speeches and controversial positions, it is about building relationships and digging into the details to move our region, state and country forward.\n\nDerickson\u2019s measured approach extends to some of the hot-button issues of our day:\n\n\u2022He\u2019s the only one of the five candidates interviewed who seemed to grasp the complexity of the immigration issue. He believes we must secure the border to protect our national security while acknowledging that deporting 11 million people is rather unlikely.\n\n\u2022While opposing same-sex marriage, he acknowledges it\u2019s now the law of the land and will be difficult to overturn.\n\n\u2022He believes President Obama has a constitutional responsibility to name a nominee for the Supreme Court vacancy and the Senate the responsibility to confirm or reject that person. In fact, he\u2019d like to see Obama nominate a consensus candidate whom both parties could support.\n\n\u201cIt would be a chance to put our country first \u2013 not ideology or gridlock,\u201d he said.\n\nThat\u2019s a truly refreshing position in this divided environment when too many candidates are slinging derogatory brickbats and failing to offer thoughtful solutions to our nation\u2019s problems.\n\nDerickson\u2019s resume, which includes stints as a farmer, businessman and Hanover Township trustee, shows good breadth of experience. Hokey manure-shoveling ads aside, he has strong community roots in the 8th, which stretches from Butler County north to Mercer County and extends east just above Dayton to take in Miami and Clark counties.\n\nTwo strong runners-up for 8th\n\nTwo GOP political newcomers have shown promise in this race and could be strong public servants with a little seasoning:\n\n\u2022Davidson, 45, of Miami County, has an impressive background as an entrepreneur, West Point graduate and former Army Ranger. He\u2019s well-spoken and knows what he\u2019s talking about when he says the United States should confine its military challenge of ISIS to special forces, not ground troops.\n\nHowever, Davidson has received endorsements and money from far-right conservative groups and individuals, including U.S. Rep. Jim Jordan of Urbana, chairman of the House Freedom Caucus. We are not yet convinced that Davidson has the independent streak needed to best represent the district.\n\n\u2022Spurlino, 52, a Washington Township resident and owner of Spurlino Materials in Middletown. He speaks passionately of his work with the nonprofit Every Child Succeeds, which helps babies get their best possible start in life.\n\nThe Spurlino who met with the editorial board doesn\u2019t mesh, however, with the one who wrote that Ohio\u2019s Medicaid expansion was \u201ca sad decision by feckless leaders. It shackled able-bodied adults \u2013 by the hundreds of thousands \u2013 into poverty with poor quality health care.\u201d\n\nBoth Davidson and Spurlino should consider running for county or Statehouse positions where they can develop their voices, sharpen their positions and show their ability to advance agendas.\n\nA couple of additional notes:\n\n\u2022On the Democratic side of the ballot, Corey Foister, 25, of Fairfield lacks the experience needed to be seriously considered for the position.\n\n\u2022Candidates for the 8th District will be in the odd position of appearing twice on the March 15 ballot \u2013 once to be their party\u2019s primary pick for the June special election to fill the remainder of Boehner\u2019s term, and once to be on the November ballot to represent the district in the next Congress. Primary voters should obviously select the same candidate twice.\n\nThe sheer number of candidates makes this a difficult race for voters to learn about, but differences do emerge upon closer inspection. The editorial board encourages voters in this and all races to check out The Enquirer\u2019s online voter guide at Cincinnati.com for more information about the candidates.\n\nEditor's note: An earlier version of this editorial incorrectly characterized Tim Derickson's position on border security. The Enquirer regrets the error.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://cin.ci/1oRP0VL", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Butler County\u2019s Tim Derickson is the Republican to represent Southwest Ohio and help end the logjam in Washington.", "p": {"domain_verify": "8c50ff021dfc409ea7325f425f178799"}, "og": {"site_name": "Cincinnati.com", "description": "Butler County\u2019s Tim Derickson is the Republican to represent Southwest Ohio and help end the logjam in Washington.", "title": "Endorsement: Here's who should fill Boehner's seat", "url": "http://www.cincinnati.com/story/opinion/editorials/2016/03/03/endorsement-tim-derickson-congress/81260064/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/cincinnati.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Butler County\u2019s Tim Derickson is the Republican to represent Southwest Ohio and help end the logjam in Washington.", "title": "Endorsement: Here's who should fill Boehner's seat", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/df98413a770709437c6466f022d986ab80df0232/c=864-0-4320-3456&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2016/03/03/Cincinnati/B9321101967Z.1_20160303093354_000_G6PDKU6JL.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@enquirer", "site": "@enquirer", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600019252", "fb": {"app_id": 157995810912644}, "viewport": "width=1070", "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Organizations/Republican Party", "gci-asset-type": "Story", "gci-categories": "Organizations/Republican Party", "title": "Endorsement: Here's who should fill Boehner's seat", "author": "Enquirer editorial board", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "opinion/editorials", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/07685c83f895bf0c6199e8efe706d3aae1292b26/c=1296-0-3888-3456/local/-/media/2016/03/03/Cincinnati/B9321101967Z.1_20160303093354_000_G6PDKU6JL.1-0.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/ebf1a7a0cbe37ff421bdfb019e9283f02cf642ff/c=864-0-4320-3456/local/-/media/2016/03/03/Cincinnati/B9321101967Z.1_20160303093354_000_G6PDKU6JL.1-0.jpg", "contenttype": "Story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/3a3d056d2f4b50884acd36c237db6d171e941ff0/c=288-0-4896-3456/local/-/media/2016/03/03/Cincinnati/B9321101967Z.1_20160303093354_000_G6PDKU6JL.1-0.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/2a6573745064622162eb3405ad5bd1daa4942810/c=0-270-5184-3186&r=x1683&c=3200x1680/local/-/media/2016/03/03/Cincinnati/B9321101967Z.1_20160303093354_000_G6PDKU6JL.1-0.jpg", "publishtime": "2016-03-03T11:08:29.977000-05:00", "shorthed": "Endorsement: Here's who should fill Boehner's seat", "articleid": 81260064, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/3658fd42755583d64b04f69690f6d4a6f28401aa/c=0-270-5184-3186/local/-/media/2016/03/03/Cincinnati/B9321101967Z.1_20160303093354_000_G6PDKU6JL.1-0.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/ed8bc1413d2cc061d591d579e7a65f8870c7ae19/c=1620-0-3564-3456/local/-/media/2016/03/03/Cincinnati/B9321101967Z.1_20160303093354_000_G6PDKU6JL.1-0.jpg"}}}, "article_summary": "State Rep.
