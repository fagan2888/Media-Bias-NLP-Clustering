Lee hopes to visit every Missouri newspaper, radio station, and television station by the end of October.\n\nDuring his visit, he set his alarm for a nine-minute presentation while having his wrist handcuffed to a paint can that has a \u201cStop Kicking the Can\u201d sign on the front of it.\n\nLee first wrote down the national debt at 3:08 p.m., which showed $19,108,426,100.\n\nHis unique approach is to bring attention to his platform of eliminating the national debt by 2033 or 2043. His hope is that politicians can stop \u201ckicking the can\u201d when it comes to this debt that he says is going to impact future generations. Lee also hopes to eliminate the annual $400 billion budget deficit.\n\nHis platform also includes plants to simplify the income tax, secure social security, rein-in regulations, replace Obamacare, resolve the immigration crisis, clean-up campaigning with an emphasis on transparency, want for a responsible and responsive government, along with several other platform objectives.\n\n\u201cMy campaign is to the thought leaders of the state,\u201d Lee said. \u201cI want to engage them in my effort to influence the debate\u2026\u201dLee is using his own money for his campaign with hopes of winning, and at the very least, to force incumbent U.S. Senator Roy Blunt and other candidates to answer key questions.\n\nExamples would be for Senator Blunt to specifically release his plans to eliminate the national debt and plans to balance the budget.\n\nLee also shared a few of his favorite things with a list in the spirit of an original song from \u201cThe Sound of Music\u201d called \u201cThese are a few of my favorite things\u2026\u201d\n\nAt the end of the candidate\u2019s presentation, which actually went long at 12 minutes, Lee reported the national debt had increased about $800,000 per minute.\n\nMore about Lee\n\nThe Ashland, Mo. man has visited \u201cThe Vandalia Leader\u201d office in the past as he is a college friend of former owner Gary Sosniecki.\n\nLee is 65 and says he\u2019s been a spectator in politics since the mid-1970s.\n\nDuring the past 25 years, Lee has been an actor performing for conference audiences as Thomas Jefferson, Daniel Boone, and William Clark.\n\nThough it may look silly for Lee to have a paint can handcuffed to his wrist, he said he was serious in his efforts.\n\n\u201cI have devoted a year of my life to this effort,\u201d he added.\n\nLearn more about Lee on his website WriteInPatrickLee.com.", "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "vfb-version": "2.7.5", "generator": "WordPress 4.2.2"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fddb8a\"", "article_summary": "Lee hopes to visit every Missouri newspaper, radio station, and television station by the end of October.\nExamples would be for Senator Blunt to specifically release his plans to eliminate the national debt and plans to balance the budget.\nHis unique approach is to bring attention to his platform of eliminating the national debt by 2033 or 2043.\nLee first wrote down the national debt at 3:08 p.m., which showed $19,108,426,100.\nOne U.S. Senate candidate hoping to represent Missouri on the federal level after the November election visited The Vandalia Leader\u2019s office last Thursday."}
