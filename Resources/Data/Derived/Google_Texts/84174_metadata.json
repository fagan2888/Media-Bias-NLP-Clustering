He will report to Johnson and join the Fidelity Operating Committee.\n\nLast year, Fidelity's financial services revenue rose 6.4 percent to $15.88 billion. That top-line growth was better than the 3 percent at rival BlackRock Inc and 5.5 percent at T. Rowe Price Group Inc, their 2015 financial reports show.\n\nNet deposits into Fidelity mutual funds, however, have lagged No. 1 mutual fund company Vanguard Group for several years. In 2015, for example, Vanguard had $230.4 billion in net deposits into its funds. Most of that was in its index funds. By contrast, Fidelity had $8.3 billion in net withdrawals from its actively managed funds, according to Morningstar Inc.\n\n(Editing by Jonathan Oatis and Fiona Ortiz)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/04/06/Fidelitys-parent-moves-McGraw-expanded-CFO-role", "type": "article", "site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "BOSTON (Reuters) - Fidelity Investments parent FMR LLC on Wednesday named company vete", "title": "Fidelity's parent moves McGraw to expanded CFO role"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/04/06/Fidelitys-parent-moves-McGraw-expanded-CFO-role", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "BOSTON (Reuters) - Fidelity Investments parent FMR LLC on Wednesday named company vete", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Fidelity Institutional will now be led by Jeffrey Lagarce, 61, previously head of Fidelity Institutional Asset Management.\nMcGraw, 61, will replace Alan Scheuer, 62, who will retire at the end of June after nine years in the role, Fidelity said in a press statement.\nBOSTON (Reuters) - Fidelity Investments parent FMR LLC on Wednesday named company veteran Gerard McGraw as its new chief financial officer and gave him an expanded role overseeing finance and brokerage operations.\nBy contrast, Fidelity had $8.3 billion in net withdrawals from its actively managed funds, according to Morningstar Inc.(Editing by Jonathan Oatis and Fiona Ortiz)\nIn 2015, for example, Vanguard had $230.4 billion in net deposits into its funds."}
