When workouts resumed in August, he had been held out of a scrimmage and a few practices after experiencing some soreness in the shoulder. But he proclaimed last week and again on Monday that he was healthy and ready to go.\n\nHead coach Urban Meyer said last week that the soreness was an expected result of Miller\u2019s throwing in practice.\n\n\u201cI anticipated this,\u201d Meyer said. \u201cI\u2019ve dealt with guys with arm issues before, and we\u2019re being very cautious. He could have practiced (in one of the workouts in which he didn\u2019t play) but we\u2019re in it for the long haul. So he\u2019s right on schedule.\u201d\n\nSpeaking briefly with reporters after Monday\u2019s first practice of a two-a-day session, Miller said he was feeling fine and would be in good shape for the season opener on Aug. 30 against Navy in Baltimore.\n\nAt the Buckeyes\u2019 media day last week, Miller said his arm felt good and he was able to throw as much as he liked.\n\n\u201cAfter my rehab, I was throwing to guys at least four days out of the week,\u201d he said. \u201cOur timing and our situation-wise, when I get back in there it\u2019ll be like I never left.\u201d\n\nIf Miller is unable to play in the Buckeyes\u2019 opener, redshirt freshman J.T. Barrett would likely get the start, backed by sophomore Cardale Jones.\n\nBut the falloff in experience would be precipitous.\n\nMiller has thrown 666 passes in his glittering three-year career. Barrett has never played in a game, and Jones has thrown only two passes.\n\nBarrett, a 6-foot-1, 225-pounder out of Wichita Falls, Texas, was an acclaimed recruit who watched along with Jones last year as Miller took most of the snaps in the Buckeyes\u2019 12-2 season. When Miller was hurt for most of the San Diego State, California and Florida A&M games with a sprained knee, senior Kenny Guiton had big games while leading Ohio State to victories.\n\nBut now Guiton has graduated, and the Buckeyes might have to adapt on the fly to a new signal-caller.\n\nMaking that even more difficult is that Ohio State is without four of its five starting offensive linemen, its leading receiver (Corey Brown) and 1,500-yard rusher Carlos Hyde from last year\u2019s team.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Miller, a senior, had missed spring practice after surgery on his right shoulder.
