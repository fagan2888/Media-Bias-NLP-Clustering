Colorado climbers remain on Everest as rescue efforts continue after a massive earthquake killed more than 2,800 people in Nepal and Asia. The death toll reportedly includes Denver-born filmmaker Tom Taplin.

Colorado climbers Jim Davidson, Alan Arnette, Charley Mace, Jon Kedrowski, Ryan Waters, Matt Moniz, Kim Hess and Dave Elmore are all safe. Davidson, Arnette and Mace are at camps above the Khumbu Icefall, where the route over the glacier was destroyed.

NBC News reported that Taplin, 61, was making a documentary about the Mount Everest base camp when the avalanche hit. Taplin’s Facebook page lists his home as Evergreen. “The gods of the mountains have taken him … our loss forever,” a friend posted.

In a blog tweeted from the mountain, Kedrowski wrote: “The lucky ones here that are unharmed and have plenty of supplies it is up to us to stay for awhile and lend a hand.”

Kedrowski’s blog depicts a horrific scene as ice and rock tumbled onto the base camp. “Right now 20-plus people are injured and the death toll is 8-20 people, but that may increase. Many of the injuries were similar to ones you might see in the Midwest when a tornado hits, with contusions and lacerations from flying debris. Head Injuries (sic), broken legs, internal injuries, impalements also happened to people,” he wrote.

Moniz, who was also at the base camp, is a 17-year-old junior at Boulder High School and is studying molecular biology at the University of Colorado at Boulder.

Mike Moniz said his son has been working with rescue teams and helping to move the injured to a medical tent run by the Himalayan Rescue Association. The former Eagle Scout also has been helping to evacuate the wounded.
