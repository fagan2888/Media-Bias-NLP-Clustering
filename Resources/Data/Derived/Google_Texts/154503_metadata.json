The number of homes changing hands next year still should grow by 10 percent even if things slow a bit from today, he said.\n\nFlorida Realtors, the state\u2019s Realtors trade group, met in Orlando Tuesday for an economic summit on where the housing market is and where it\u2019s headed.\n\nHousing has been so hot in 2013 that it has sparked talk of a bubble, but no one on Tuesday gave those bubble fears any credibility. Looking at national trends, Frank Nothaft, an economist for housing finance giant Freddie Mac, said homes are still well below their peaks in the mid-2000s.\n\nFor example, a home that sold for $400,000 in 2006 fell to just $200,000 during the crash. It has since rebounded by a strong 25 percent, but it\u2019s still worth only $250,000.\n\n\u201cSo, to me, I don\u2019t see a bubble,\u201d Nothaft said. \u201cPrices are still really, really low.\u201d\n\nMore locally, Florida\u2019s housing market is in flux, economists said. Investors helped send prices up 20 percent year-over-year, as they snapped up every available home they could under $200,000 and some even above that level. Last January, more than 50 percent of all sales of existing single-family homes went to all-cash buyers, Florida Realtors figures show. It\u2019s assumed that a majority of them were investors.\n\nThat has subsided some, and in recent months cash sales accounted for around 42 percent of all sales. As investors slow down, more modest homes in the $100,000 and $150,000 range should hit the market again, Tuccillo said.\n\nMeantime, rising housing prices have helped thousands of Floridians to climb out from being \u201cunderwater\u201d on their mortgages, or owing more on their mortgage than their homes are worth. That\u2019s good news overall and it will let them list their homes for sale for the first time in a long time.\n\nIt does mean, however, that housing prices will taper off as more homes hit the market, Tuccillo said.\n\nThe biggest challenge to Florida\u2019s real estate market in 2014 will be a lack of loans from lenders, economists said. Mortgage rates might climb to 5 percent by the end of next year from about 4.5 percent today, Nothaft predicted, but that\u2019s still historically low and shouldn\u2019t scare off buyers.\n\nBut lenders are so confused about coming changes from the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection act, which has new rules on home lending, that they\u2019re restricting loans. Some 60 percent of Dodd-Frank\u2019s regulations are delayed, so banks don\u2019t know how much money they\u2019ll be able to loan to customers and how much they\u2019ll have to keep in reserve.\n\nThey\u2019d rather park their money in safe investments such as the money market, Tuccillo said.\n\nOverall, Florida\u2019s housing market looks positive for 2014, because the state is creating jobs again. That should help housing values rise by about 5 percent next year, which is about the historical average, Tuccillo said.\n\nStill, all the uncertainty from the Affordable Care Act, the Dodd-Frank regulations and the slowdown of investors mean finding buyers won\u2019t be as easy as it was in 2013.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re gradually moving towards a buyer\u2019s market,\u201d Tuccillo said.\n\nmsasso@tampatrib.com\n\n(813) 259-7865\n\nTwitter: @msasso", "article_metadata": {"taboola-pub-time": "Tue, 10 Dec 2013 16:31:34 -0400", "Description": "ORLANDO \u2014 Homebuyers frustrated at rising prices and too few homes on the market should see some relief next year, as fewer purchases by investors and other powerful forces push Florida into a", "og": {"site_name": "TBO.com", "description": "ORLANDO \u2014 Homebuyers frustrated at rising prices and too few homes on the market should see some relief next year, as fewer purchases by investors and other powerful forces push Florida into a", "title": "Housing recovery will slow in 2014: Florida Realtors", "url": "http://www.tbo.com/news/business/housing-recovery-will-slow-in-2014-florida-realtors-20131210/", "image": {"width": 200, "identifier": "http://www.tbo.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/staticimage/images/new_og_icon.png", "height": 200}, "updated_time": "2013-12-10T16:31:00Z-04", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"title": "Housing recovery will slow in 2014: Florida Realtors"}, "fb": {"app_id": 522234267826834}, "msvalidate.01": "29E67031F86E7FB6DF9823924E21B8B4", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/tbocom", "published_time": "2013-12-10T16:31:34Z-04", "modified_time": "2013-12-10T16:31:00Z-04"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Florida Realtors, the state\u2019s Realtors trade group, met in Orlando Tuesday for an economic summit on where the housing market is and where it\u2019s headed.\nThat said, Florida\u2019s housing market should keep recovering in 2014, Florida Realtors chief economist John Tuccillo said Tuesday.\nOverall, Florida\u2019s housing market looks positive for 2014, because the state is creating jobs again.\n\u201cPrices are still really, really low.\u201dMore locally, Florida\u2019s housing market is in flux, economists said.\nIt does mean, however, that housing prices will taper off as more homes hit the market, Tuccillo said."}
