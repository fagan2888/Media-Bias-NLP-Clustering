The breach cut in half the number of hospitals available to adults and children in Sendero\u2019s state-sponsored Medicaid plan, the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program and the federal Affordable Care Act plan.\n\nIn all, Sendero patients lost network access to 11 Seton hospitals and four outpatient facilities.\n\n\u201cThey were able to come to an agreement on the rates on both sides,\u201d said Monica Crowley, spokeswoman for Central Health, Travis County\u2019s public hospital district.\n\nCentral Health created the nonprofit Sendero, which opened four years ago and has struggled financially ever since in competition with three other Austin-area health plans.\n\n+ Central Health is Travis County\u2019s hospital district, which oversees programs for health care services for the county\u2019s poor, uninsured and underinsured ... read more \u00d7\n\nCentral Health has transferred $45.9 million in taxpayer money into the nonprofit to pay claims and satisfy state requirements for Medicaid HMO balances, officials said in November. In the current budget year, Central Health has pledged an additional $5 million, if Sendero needs it.\n\nSendero members covered by the Medicaid HMO and CHIP now have in-network access to Seton facilities, Crowley said. Those covered by IdealCare, the ACA plan, will rejoin the Seton network starting May 1, she said.\n\nAbout 10,000 Central Texans in eight counties, including Travis, Williamson and Hays, are Sendero members.\n\nThe payment dispute added a new layer of complexity to the Seton-Central Health relationship. The two are close partners and cooperate on a nonprofit that oversees health care delivery to needy residents.\n\nCentral Health President and CEO Patricia Young Brown said in a written statement she was pleased that Seton and Sendero had reached an agreement.\n\n\u201cSince Sendero\u2019s creation, we have strived to ensure that Sendero members have access to the best possible care,\u201d she said. \u201cIncluding partners like Seton in the Sendero network, is one example of how your local, non-profit, community health plan is doing just that.\u201d\n\nCentral Health officials don\u2019t disclose financial details, including rates, for competitive reasons.", "article_metadata": {"description": "About 10,000 Central Texans insured by Sendero Health Plans will once again have access to Seton Healthcare Family facilities and doctors, officials said Monday.", "author": "By Mary Ann Roser - American-Statesman Staff", "og": {"url": "http://www.mystatesman.com/news/news/seton-facilities-back-in-network-for-10000-sendero/nqft4/", "image": "http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/img/photos/2016/03/07/0a/ad/FullSizeRender--2-.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "About 10,000 Central Texans insured by Sendero Health Plans will once again have access to Seton Healthcare Family facilities and doctors, officials said Monday.", "title": "Seton facilities back in network for 10,000 Sendero plan members"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/lt/lt_cache/resize/120x120/img/photos/2016/03/08/51/30/centralhealth.jpg", "description": "About 10,000 Central Texans insured by Sendero Health Plans will once  again have access to Seton Healthcare Family facilities and doctors,  officials said Monday.\r\nSendero parted ways with Seton,  Central Texas&rsquo; largest health care provider, in November in a dispute  over how much the plan was paying Seton for health care services.
