YPSILANTI, Mich., Sept. 5, 2015 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- Eastern Michigan University will enroll one of the largest classes of freshmen in its 166-year history when classes begin Tuesday, Sept. 8.

While final enrollment figures will not be reported until mid-September, preliminary numbers indicate that the University has already enrolled 2,865 first-time freshmen, close to the previous all-time record for freshmen of 2,872, set in 2013. Since fall 2010, when the University enrolled a total of 2,008 new freshmen, the entering class has grown by 42 percent.

The freshman class also displays improved academic preparation, strong diversity and further growth of The Honors College at Eastern.

"I want to welcome our new and returning students to our beautiful and historic campus, which is an exceptional learning environment," said Kim Schatzel, interim president, provost and executive vice president for academic and student affairs. "In recent years, we have invested in key academic and student facilities and increased financial aid while setting the pace for tuition restraint in Michigan. Those factors, coupled with our excellent faculty and the connection our students enjoy with their instructors, are attracting more and better students to Eastern."

Kevin Kucera, associate vice president of enrollment management at EMU, noted that entering freshmen and their parents often reference Eastern Michigan's high quality academic programs and facilities, combined with an affordable tuition rate, as significant factors in their selection of Eastern.

In addition to near record numbers, this year's incoming freshman class is better prepared academically. The average GPA of incoming freshmen is 3.29, up from 3.05 in 2010. Average ACT scores are also climbing. This year's freshman class has an average ACT score of 22.06, showing dramatic growth from an average of 21.05 in fall 2010.

The entering freshman class also shows increasing diversity. The number of newly enrolled African American freshmen, 731, represents 26 percent of the entering class, while the number of newly enrolling Hispanic freshmen, 168, makes up six percent of the entering class.

"These percentages are important, as they underscore that diversity of our campus is a major priority for Eastern, and an attribute we consider necessary for a high quality education," Schatzel said.

The Honors College, which accepts students entering with typically at least a 25 ACT score and 3.5 high school GPA, has more than doubled in freshman enrollment since 2011.
