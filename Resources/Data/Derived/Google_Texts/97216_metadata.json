A resolution was passed without one dissenting colony \u2018that these United Colonies are, and of right ought to be, free and independent states, and as such they have, and of right ought to have, full power to make war, conclude peace, establish commerce, and to do all the other acts and things which other states may rightfully do.\u2019 You will see in a few days a declaration setting forth the causes which have impelled us to this mighty revolution and the reasons which will justify it in the sight of God and man. A plan of confederation will be taken up in a few days.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen I look back to the year of 1761 and recollect the argument concerning writs of assistance in the superior court, which I have hitherto considered as the commencement of the controversy between Great Britain and America, and run through the whole period from that time to this, and recollect the series of political events, the chain of causes and effects, I am surprised at the suddenness as well as greatness of this revolution. Britain has been fill\u2019d with Folly and America with Wisdom, at least this is my Judgment.\u201d\n\n\u201cTime must determine. It is the will of Heaven that the two countries should be sundered forever. It may be the will of Heaven that America shall suffer calamities still more wasting and distressing yet more dreadful. If this is to be the case, it will have this good effect, at least: it will inspire us will many virtues, which we have not, and correct many errors, follies, and vices, which threaten to disturb, dishonor, and destroy us. The furnace of affliction produces refinement, in states as well as individuals. And the new governments we are assuming, in every part, will require a purification from our vices and an augmentation of our virtues or they will be no blessings.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe people will have unbounded power. And the people are extremely addicted to corruption and venality, as well as the great. I am not without apprehensions from this quarter, but I must submit all my hopes and fears to an overruling Providence, in which, unfashionable as the faith may be, I firmly believe.\u201d\n\n", "article_metadata": {"zone": "homepage/articles", "keyword": "Politics [News]", "title": "John Adams' July Letters Show the Significance of Independence Day", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "John Adams' letters from Philadelphia celebrate a nation conceived in liberty.", "title": "Happy Birthday, America", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/opinion/blogs/peter-roff/2014/07/04/john-adams-july-letters-show-the-significance-of-independence-day", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/f9/3e/410da6984d19820db0cf44207232/140704daily1-cartoon.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"title": "John Adams' July Letters Show the Significance of Independence Day", "description": "John Adams' letters from Philadelphia celebrate a nation conceived in liberty.", "card": "summary", "site": "@USNews"}, "site": "opinion", "date_published": "July 4, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "Peter Roff,Independence Day,Adams, John,Philadelphia,Massachusetts,Thomas Jefferson Street [Opinion],Politics [News]", "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "John Adams' letters from Philadelphia celebrate a nation conceived in liberty."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdfc75\"", "article_summary": "It may be the will of Heaven that America shall suffer calamities still more wasting and distressing yet more dreadful.\nBritain has been fill\u2019d with Folly and America with Wisdom, at least this is my Judgment.\u201d\u201cTime must determine.\n\u201cYesterday the greatest question was decided, which ever was debated in America, and a greater, perhaps, never was or will be decided among Men.\nAnd the people are extremely addicted to corruption and venality, as well as the great.\nIt is the will of Heaven that the two countries should be sundered forever."}
