They have the credibility and experience needed to deliver the most effective HIV prevention strategies to those who need them most.\u201d Jonathan Mermin, MD, MPH, director, CDC\u2019s National Center\n\nfor HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and TB Prevention\n\n\u201cCommunity-based organizations have been vital to our nation\u2019s HIV prevention efforts since the earliest days of the epidemic,\u201d said Jonathan Mermin, M.D., director of CDC\u2019s National Center for HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and Tuberculosis Prevention. \u201cThe organizations we\u2019re funding have a strong foothold in the hardest-hit communities. They have the credibility and experience needed to deliver the most effective HIV prevention strategies to those who need them most.\u201d\n\nCBOs will use the new funding to deliver high-impact HIV prevention strategies, including:\n\nProviding HIV testing to those at high risk to increase the proportion of people who are aware of their HIV status\n\nEngaging HIV-positive people in ongoing care and treatment, helping them adhere to antiretroviral therapy, and ensuring they receive prevention and support services\n\nEnsuring high-risk, HIV-negative individuals have access to prevention and support services such as pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP), high-impact behavioral interventions, and screening for sexually transmitted infections\n\nDistributing condoms to HIV-positive and high-risk, HIV-negative individuals\n\nFor the first time in its nearly 30-year history, the funding program includes a component that allows organizations to pool their expertise and resources into \u201cPrevention Partnerships.\u201d Of the 90 organizations receiving funding, 30 will serve as the lead of a partnership comprised of several organizations. Through these partnerships, 47 additional organizations will contribute their own unique expertise to help deliver more comprehensive prevention services to those in greatest need.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s clear that we need to focus our limited resources on strategies that can have the greatest possible impact,\u201d said Eugene McCray, M.D., director of CDC\u2019s Division of HIV/AIDS Prevention. \u201cThis funding targets local communities to help maximize the impact of every federal prevention dollar. By delivering powerful prevention tools where they\u2019re needed most, we can have a transformative impact on the epidemic.\u201d\n\nThe funded organizations are in the 50 geographic areas that reported the highest number of HIV diagnoses in 2011. Each organization has demonstrated experience and expertise working with the populations most affected by the epidemic. Of the 90 directly-funded CBOs, 67 (74.4 percent) primarily serve African Americans and 15 (16.7 percent) primarily serve Hispanics; 64 (71.1 percent) primarily serve MSM. A full list of funded CBOs is available at http://www.cdc.gov/hiv/funding/announcements/ps15-1502/organizations.html.\n\nCDC provided extensive pre-application guidance and technical assistance to help interested CBOs apply for the funding. Funded CBOs will be required to monitor program impact and behavioral outcomes. Moving forward, CDC will provide technical assistance and support \u2013 directly and through funding for its capacity-building partners \u2013 to help ensure funded CBOs are successful in meeting key goals associated with the funding, such as increasing HIV testing among those at-risk and increasing the number of people with HIV who are linked to medical care.\n\n\u201cBirmingham AIDS Outreach has been working since 1985 to reverse the devastating impact of HIV in our community \u2013 and now, with this new funding from CDC, we can do even more, along with our community partners AIDS Alabama and the Aletheia House,\u201d said Karen Musgrove, executive director of Birmingham AIDS Outreach. \u201cWe\u2019re grateful for and excited about the opportunity to invest in delivering the cutting edge of HIV prevention to those who need it most across the state of Alabama.\u201d\n\nCBO funding is one critical piece of CDC HIV prevention investments\n\nCDC supports HIV prevention at national, state, local, and territorial levels, and these awards represent just one part of CDC\u2019s nearly $700 million annual investment in domestic HIV prevention. The bulk of that annual funding goes directly to state and local health departments \u2013 and, indirectly, to many additional community-based organizations across the nation \u2013 to prevent HIV infection among those at greatest risk.\n\nThe awards announced today reflect CDC\u2019s focus on a high-impact prevention approach, which prioritizes strategies that are scientifically proven, cost-effective, scalable, and targeted to the geographic areas and populations that need them most.\n\nNationally, CDC\u2019s approach to HIV prevention primarily focuses on:\n\nIdentifying undiagnosed HIV infections through increased testing\n\nEnsuring that people with HIV receive ongoing care and treatment to improve their health and reduce transmission to others\n\nEnsuring those at highest risk for HIV have the knowledge and tools needed to protect themselves\n\nFor additional information, visit www.cdc.gov/nchhstp/newsroom.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "blog.aids.gov \u2014 HIV Policy & Programs.
