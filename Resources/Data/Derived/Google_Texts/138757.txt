Hundreds have signed a petition calling on renowned D.C. Chef Jose Andres to dump Donald Trump.

The petition on Change.org says Andres should back out of his deal to open a restaurant at the future Trump Hotel in the Old Post Office Pavilion in D.C., because of recent comments the presidential candidate made about Mexican immigrants.

Andres, who is from Spain, replied to one tweet last week saying his views on immigration are clear that “All men and women should be treated respectfully, regardless of their status.”
