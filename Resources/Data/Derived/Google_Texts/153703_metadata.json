Sign up here.**\n\nBuzz Cut:\n\n\u2022 2016 Power Index: Unsteady Walker still Jeb\u2019s top rival, but press pile on continues\n\n\u2022 Poll: Cruz, Walker all tied up in Texas\n\n\u2022 Obama gives Warren a lift in Wall Street war\n\n\u2022 Senate Dems keep up blockade for Obama amnesty\n\n\u2022 Never bet against Megatoad\n\n2016 POWER INDEX: UNSTEADY WALKER STILL JEB\u2019S TOP RIVAL, BUT PRESS PILE ON CONTINUES\n\nOddly, the cardinal attribute now sought in a presidential candidate is the ability to successfully evade horrid questions. And Scott Walker is learning that the hard way. The Wisconsin governor\u2019s most recent error was complaining aloud about a puerile question posed by the WaPo about what Walker believed President Obama believes about Jesus Christ. In so doing, Walker gave the kind of response his questioners were hoping for, because the words \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d were part of a soliloquy on media bias. A question like this is the rhetorical equivalent of throwing a wolverine at a man\u2019s face and then writing the headline: \u201cCandidate struggles with wolverine attack.\u201d Well, yeah... But the wolverines will keep coming, and so will the honey badgers, ferrets, otters and the rest of the family Mustelidae. And if you want to be president, you\u2019d better find a way to deal with it.\n\n\n\nThis is Walker\u2019s second such error. On a trip to London earlier this month, Walker let his internal monologue slip out when he said he was going to \u201cpunt\u201d a crummy question about evolution. When being treated like a native shipped back to England by Captain Cook, it would be tempting to say much worse than that. But even announcing the \u201cpunt\u201d was bad enough. What Walker said subsequently was just fine. But his blurted intention to evade was all that anyone will remember. If you want to dodge, just look to the president, who has punted for more yards in Washington than anyone since Sammy Baugh. The president just boots that sucker down to the other end zone, the ball carried aloft on great gusts of windy words.\n\n\n\nIn order to fulfill the media narrative in which Jeb Bush is the sensible candidate trying to tame an insane Republican Party, Scott Walker must be made into an insane person. He is trying hard not to oblige the press, but if he wants to win, he will have to stop telegraphing his evasions and do what every other successful politician does and just dropkick his answers.\n\n\n\n[Watch Fox: Chris Stirewalt joins Gretchen Carlson on \u201cThe Real Story\u201d in the 2 p.m. ET hour with the latest on who\u2019s up and who\u2019s down in the 2016 Power Index.]\n\n\n\nAnd here\u2019s this week\u2019s full ranking: 1) Jeb Bush; 2) Scott Walker; 3) Marco Rubio; 4) Ted Cruz; 5) Rick Perry [+1]; 6) Rand Paul [-1]; 7) John Kasich [+2] 8) Ben Carson [-1]; 9) Chris Christie [-1]; 10) Mike Huckabee [-1].\n\n\n\nOn the Radar - Rick Santorum, Bobby Jindal, Mike Pence, Carly Fiorina, Lindsey Graham, John Bolton\n\n\n\n[What would you say? - Give us your take on the GOP field and we will share the best and brightest with the whole class. Send your thoughts to FOXNEWSFIRST@FOXNEWS.COM]\n\n\n\nMiami vice: WaPo restocks story on Jeb\u2019s wife\u2019s spending - WaPo goes back to the 1990s to look at the spending habits of Columba Bush, wife of then-Florida Gov. Jeb Bush \u201c\u2026she took out a loan to buy $42,311.70 worth of jewelry on a single day, according to records filed with the state of Florida by Mayors Jewelers. That purchase was part of a pattern by Columba Bush of borrowing to buy tens of thousands of dollars of jewelry at a time from the South Florida store over a 14-year period.\u201d\n\n\n\nGovernment worker unions reeling under Walker rules - WaPo: \u201cThe anti-union law passed here four years ago, which made Gov. Scott Walker a national Republican star and a possible presidential candidate, has turned out to be even more transformative than many had predicted. Walker had vowed that union power would shrink, workers would be judged on their merits, and local governments would save money. Unions had warned that workers would lose benefits and be forced to take on second jobs or find new careers. Many of those changes came to pass, but the once-thriving \u00adpublic-sector unions were not just shrunken, they were crippled. Unions representing teachers, professors, trash collectors and other government employees are struggling to stem plummeting membership rolls and retain relevance in the state where they got their start.\u201d\n\n\n\nRubio steps it up in New Hampshire - WMUR: \u201cU.S. Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida is heading to New Hampshire to interact directly with voters who will help determine his presidential fate. Rubio, a Republican, is traveling to key early voting states to promote his book, \"American Dreams.\" Rubio's trip to New Hampshire includes a Q-and-A session with voters in Hollis and a book signing in Manchester [today]. He'll also speak at 'Politics & Eggs' on Tuesday in Manchester. ...Observers doubted whether Rubio would run for president against his political mentor, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, but Rubio recently signaled he is serious about a run by hiring New Hampshire operative Jim Merrill.\u201d\n\n\n\nPoll: Cruz, Walker all tied up in Texas - Texas Tribune: \u201cWisconsin Gov. Scott Walker has erased U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz\u2019s strong lead among Texas Republicans in the volatile and still-developing race for the party\u2019s 2016 presidential nomination, according to the latest University of Texas/Texas Tribune Poll. Cruz\u2019s 25 percentage-point lead over Walker in October has vanished: The Texan won the support of 20 percent of the state\u2019s registered voters to Walker\u2019s 19 percent \u2014 a statistical tie. Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and author Ben Carson were tied at 9 percent, and former Texas Gov. Rick Perry was next at 8 percent.\u201d\n\n\n\nPerry plays up hawkish stance on Putin - Weekly Standard: \u201cFormer Texas governor Rick Perry is taking on Russian president Vladimir Putin. The possible presidential candidate says that the \u2018peace and security of the world\u2019 depends on how America deals with Russia in a video statement\u2026\u2018The United States needs to get back in the game. The administration\u2019s actions have put us on the sidelines. We need to lead our allies, this is Russia we are talking about. We have to stop telling Putin what we won\u2019t do and telegraphing our limitations. Obama always thinks through the consequences of action, and never considers the consequences of inaction. The peace and security of the world is at stake and the consequences of inaction are too great to be ignored.\u2019\u201d\n\n\n\nKasich cites scripture to Rand\u2019s hit on ObamaCare expansion - Bloomberg:\u201cPotential 2016 contender Gov. John Kasich, R-Ohio, defended his decision take Medicaid expansion money under Obamacare, rival Sixteener Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., has called a move by governors who think money grows on trees. \u2018You know, Matthew 25 says that it\u2019s about how you treat the widowed, how you treat the poor, how you treat the hungry,\u2019 Kasich said on CNN. \u2018How do you clothe those who have no clothes? That is a conservative position to help them get on their feet so they then can assume their rightful place in our society.\u2019 In Kentucky, he added, \u2018maybe everybody\u2019s fine, maybe there aren\u2019t people who are suffering these problems.\u2019\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not saying I won\u2019t. I\u2019m not saying I will. I\u2019m leaving my options out there and we\u2019ll see how things develop.\u201d \u2013Gov. John Kasich, R-Ohio, on CNN.\n\n\n\nThe Galilee Primary - Mike Huckabee is the only top-tier Republican candidate taking a pass on this week\u2019s CPAC cattle call, but WaPo explains what he\u2019s been up to: \u201c\u2026Huckabee is currently shepherding his flock of 253 paying guests around Israel for 10 days. That\u2019s six busloads \u2014 a lot more people than may follow some candidates around New Hampshire in February next year. The Huckabee entourage includes \u2026 country western star Larry Gatlin, who came off the bus here at Masada sporting a burnt-orange cap with a stitched-on pistol and the words \u201cTexas: We Don\u2019t Call 911\u201d \u2014 which is kind of appropriate if you know the story of Masada. The price is $5,250, including round-trip airfare from New York, five-star hotel accommodations, all meals, deluxe motor-coach transport, licensed guides and all fees, tips and taxes. Huckabee\u2019s wife, Janet, said they tell guests they can bring a $20 bill and come home with the change.\u201d\n\n\n\nPence plucky - Fox News: \u201cIndiana Gov. Mike Pence suggested Sunday that he\u2019s still considering a 2016 White House run but brushed aside questions about whether his expected mid-spring decision will leave him too far behind the coalescing GOP field.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI was raised to say \u2018do what is in front of you, do it well.\u2019 and then we'll consider whatever opportunities.\u201d \u2013Gov. Mike Pence, R-Ind., on \u201cFox News Sunday with Chris Wallace.\u201d Watch here.\n\n\n\nOBAMA GIVES WARREN A LIFT IN WALL ST. WAR\n\nUSA Today: \u201cPresident Obama will order the Labor Department on Monday to begin developing new rules for financial managers who handle retirement accounts for working Americans. \u2026 Obama will make the announcement during Monday afternoon visit to the offices of AARP, according to the White House schedule. Among guests at the speech: Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., an outspoken critic of some Wall Street practices.\u201d\n\n\n\n[Pressure is growing from Hillary boosters for Warren to make it official and endorse the frontrunner now.]\n\n\n\nHillary shucked in Iowa over foreign fundraising - Ken Thomas checked in with Iowa Democrats to see how the flap over foreign contributions to the Clinton foundation was playing: \u201c\u2018There was a reason they stopped taking foreign government donations when [Hillary Clinton]was secretary of state,\u2019 said Mike Carberry, a Johnson County, Iowa, supervisor and former county Democratic chairman. He said the foundation should reinstate the policies used from 2009 to 2013. \u2018It doesn\u2019t seem right.\u2019 \u2026 Beyond the headlines, many Democrats say it shows the need for Clinton to begin actively campaigning and build an apparatus better suited to rapidly respond to these types of critiques. \u2018There\u2019s a vacuum,\u2019 said Tom Henderson, the chairman of the Polk County, Iowa, Democrats, who noted potential candidates such as former Maryland Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley and former Virginia Sen. Jim Webb are visiting soon. \u2018She isn\u2019t doing anything\u2019 in Iowa, he said.\u201d\n\n\n\nIndigestion over branding - WaPo: \u201cIs Hillary Rodham Clinton a McDonald\u2019s Big Mac or a Chipotle burrito bowl? A can of Bud or a bottle of Blue Moon? JCPenney or J. Crew? As she readies her second presidential campaign, Clinton has recruited consumer marketing specialists onto her team of trusted political advisers.\u201d\n\n\n\nWhatever breed you like - WashEx: \u201cHillary Rodham Clinton\u2019s campaign in waiting, \u2018Ready for Hillary,\u2019 \u2026 is piggybacking off the winner of last week\u2019s The Westminster Kennel Club 139th Annual Dog Show to pitch some trinkets like dog collars and bowls. In the past, the group has featured a brown Boston terrier. But in a new email a beagle, like the show winner, is used.\u201d\n\n\n\nMcAuliffe calls for Clinton to hoard cash - \u201cHaving done this for many years, the second you get in and open up a campaign account, let me tell you, that money just goes out the door. There\u2019s no need at this point. We\u2019re in a very good position, so she can take her time on her timetable, which is spectacular.\u201d \u2013Gov. Terry McAuliffe, D-Va., in an interview with WaPo\n\n\n\nWITH YOUR SECOND CUP OF COFFEE...\n\nA young photographer and a group of Marines staked their claim on history with a flag and a message. Associated Press photographer Joe Rosenthal saw a few Marines raising an American flag in the rubble atop Mt. Suribachi on the island of Iwo Jima, scene of one of the most intense battles of World War II. Just as he reached the scene to capture the moment, however, the flag was already up. Rosenthal saw another group raising an even larger flag nearby, and seized his chance. He took the photograph that would go on to win him a Pulitzer Prize and a place in American history. The image of the Marines captured on this day 70 years ago served as the model for the Marine Corps War Memorial and continues to serve as a symbol of the determination and pride that the Marines embody.

The impasse continues amid reports that Senate Republicans are considering a plan in which they would split off legislation attacking the president\u2019s executive actions, but it\u2019s unclear whether conservative Republicans would go along with de-coupling it from DHS funding. \u201c\u2018We would try to have a vote on just that issue,\u2019 a Republican aide told the Hill. \u2018Does it have to be addressed as part of DHS, or can it be addressed separately? If we can get to that issue and have a vote on that issue, then you come back to DHS appropriations.\u2019\u201d With the House returning Tuesday evening, just three days remain for Congress to work out a legislative solution.\n\n\n\nHello, Iowa! - \u201cI hope my House colleagues will understand that our best bet is to challenge this in court, that if we don\u2019t fund the Department of Homeland Security, we'll get blamed as a party.\u201d \u2013Sen.

They'll be able to make their case in person when they convene at the White House on Monday morning.\u201d\n\n\n\nObama\u2019s pen to find new use this week - NYT : \u201cWielding the weapon of his pen, President Obama this week is expected to formally reject a Republican attempt to force construction of the Keystone XL oil pipeline. But in stopping the transit of petroleum from the forests of Alberta to the Gulf Coast, Mr. Obama will be opening the veto era of his presidency. The expected Keystone veto, the third and most significant of Mr. Obama's six years in office, would likely be followed by presidential vetoes of bills that would make changes in the Affordable Care Act, impose new sanctions on Iran and roll back child nutrition standards, among others.\u201d\n\n\n\n[Watch Fox: Chief Congressional Correspondent Mike Emanuel with the latest on the immigration/DHS funding fight from Capitol Hill.]\n\n\n\nGovernment bank under fire yanks public info - The Hill : \u201cCritics of the Export-Import Bank are seething over the removal from a government Web site of previously public data earlier they say helps them detect cronyism. Between January 29 and February 13, officials at the bank removed disclosures listing businesses that applied for financing at the bank but were denied, a source at the bank told The Hill. \"During a regular quarterly review, it was decided to reformat the way data is presented,\" the source said. Under the changes, bank officials are no longer disclosing denied applicants. But critics of the Ex-Im, created to help U.S. companies finance overseas endeavors, say that information helps illuminate how the bank chooses which businesses to finance.\u201d\n\n\n\nHOMELAND BOSS SAYS 'VIOLENT EXTREMISM' EUPHEMISM AT BEHEST OF MUSLIMS\n\nFox News: \u201cHomeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson said on Sunday that President Obama\u2019s decision not to say the actions of the Islamic State is a form of \u201cradical Islam\u201d is at the behest of the Muslim community. \u2018The thing I hear from leaders in the Muslim community in this country is ISIL is attempting to hijack my religion,\u2019 Johnson told \u2018Fox News Sunday,\u2019 referring to the terror group also known as Islamic State, or ISIS. Johnson said the leaders argue their religion is about peace and brotherhood and \u2018resent\u2019 that Islamic State is \u2018attempting to hijack that from us.\u2019 Obama is facing sharp criticism, even from within his own party, for instead using the term \u2018violent extremism\u2019 to describe the actions of ISIS and other terror groups that are based on a form of Islam\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\nNo shouting, please - Reuters: \u201cU.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and his Iranian counterpart Mohammad Javad Zarif met for two hours in Geneva on Sunday in another round of nuclear talks to try to narrow gaps as they pressed against a March 31 deadline to reach a political agreement.\u201d\n\n\n\nNEVER BET AGAINST MEGATOAD\n\nMatt \u201cMegatoad\u201d Stonie set the bacon-eating world record by consuming 182 slices in five minutes.

Unofficial records show the previous record was a meager 54 pieces though Major League Eating had not officially sponsored a bacon contest before. Stonie sits neck and neck with Joey \u201cJaws\u201d Chestnut among MLE's list of gustatory greats and admitted he needed to set the bar high to preserve his feat.\n\n\n\nChris Stirewalt is digital politics editor for Fox News.
