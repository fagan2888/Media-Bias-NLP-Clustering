A small plane carrying nine people crashed into the ocean off the Hawaiian island of Molokai, killing the director of the state Department of Health, officials said. The eight others onboard, including the pilot, survived.The Makani Kai Air plane, bound for Honolulu, went down on Wednesday about a half-mile northwest of Kalaupapa peninsula, Maui Fire Department spokesman Lee Mainaga said in a statement.Health department director Loretta Fuddy and deputy director Keith Yamamoto were on the flight after an annual visit to Kalaupapa, a remote peninsula on the north side of Molokai Island where the state exiled leprosy patients until 1969.Tom Matsuda, interim executive director of Hawaii's health insurance exchange , confirmed the death of Fuddy, who was on the board of the exchange.

"I cannot even begin to convey what a terrible loss this is for Hawaii ," Matsuda said in a statement. "I worked closely with Director Fuddy on the Affordable Care Act and came to know and respect her as a passionate advocate for public health and a warm, caring human being."Gov. Neil Abercrombie said Fuddy was loved and respected."Her knowledge was vast, her counsel and advice always given from her heart as much as from her storehouse of experience," Abercrombie said.U.S. Sen. Brian Schatz, a former lieutenant governor under Abercrombie, said Fuddy was capable and caring. His office said Fuddy spent 30 years working in health and human services and had been health director since March 2011.Most recently, Fuddy led the department as it transitioned its marriage license system to allow gay couples to wed under a new law that took effect this month.Makai Kai Air President Richard Schuman told the Honolulu Star-Advertiser that the plane was a Cessna Grand Caravan.Coast Guard Petty Officer Melissa McKenzie said a Coast Guard helicopter rescued three passengers from the water and Maui fire crews picked up others. One person swam ashore.McKenzie said the helicopter transported three people to Honolulu for medical treatment, while a Coast Guard plane took five people to Maui.The leprosy settlement on Kalaupapa is still run by the state health department, though only a few former leprosy patients continue to live there.
