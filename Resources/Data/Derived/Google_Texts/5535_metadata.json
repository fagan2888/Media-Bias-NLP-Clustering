That\u2019s usually the way it is when an incumbent steps aside after eight years on the scene.\n\nBut it\u2019s the things that the candidates haven\u2019t been saying that may be most telling. In different ways, each remaining candidate has been a creation of an Obama effect.\n\nLet\u2019s start with the Democrats. Hillary Clinton is the easiest reflection of Obama to see. (Also, up top is the best place for me to remind readers that my wife is vice chair of the Clinton campaign.)\n\nShe is making the argument that this isn\u2019t a revolutionary moment in American life, but a time to stay the course. Sustained economic recovery, success against terrorism and a plummeting rate of uninsured \u2014 yes, thanks to Obamacare \u2014 are good reasons to run as essentially the incumbent.\n\nShe won\u2019t say the words, \u201cIf you liked the last eight years, I got more of that for ya,\u201d but she is benefitting from the sentiment because Obama \u2014 now at 52% approval nationally \u2014 is especially popular among Democrats.\n\nThe implicit message has its benefits and, of course, its limits. Hillary is also seeing how difficult it is to not only carry her own record but that of her former boss (not to mention her husband\u2019s).\n\nBernie Sanders is too smart to say it out loud, especially in states where he needs more black voters to have a chance at winning, but his message is an unspoken rebuke of Obama. His eloquent cry for a revolution is appealing to those who think there\u2019s been far too little change over the last eight years and want much bigger things to happen right now.\n\nJust as Hillary is careful not to be overt in owning too much of the Obama legacy, so is Bernie careful not to trample on it directly. But Sanders is saying that the \u201chalf a loaf\u201d doctrine of Bill Clinton and Barack Obama should be repudiated in favor of something bolder. (Interestingly, this is kind of how Obama quietly contrasted himself with Bill Clinton when he ran in 2008.)\n\nOn the Republican side, the President\u2019s name is thrown around with such contempt, the four remaining candidates are leaving zero room for that odd swing voter who remembers 2008 and isn\u2019t blinded by Obama derangement syndrome. But each of them is unwittingly saying complimentary things about our current President if you read between the lines.\n\nTed Cruz brags of his purity in leading the \u201cnever do anything\u201d wing of the Republican party. His daylong quasi filibuster and gleeful shutting down of the federal government is a proof point to his followers who are contemptuous of anything that looks like government.\n\nBut to the rest of the world, his proud obstructionism points out how amazing it is that President Obama got anything done at all. And it reminds citizens of the value of the type of quiet, adult leadership that the modern presidency requires.\n\nIn a way, Marco Rubio unwittingly exposes the same thing. He has been reduced from \u201cthe future of the party\u201d to an afterthought in part because he had the audacity to participate in an actual attempt to legislate a solution to the eminently solvable problem of illegal immigration.\n\nHis \u201ccrime\u201d to his rivals was sitting in a room with the likes of Chuck Schumer and forge a compromise. He is a walking, breathing answer to the question of why so many people agree on the framework of immigration reform \u2014 roughly 65% of Americans in most polls \u2014 yet nothing happens.\n\nSo the Rubio campaign is exhibit A in the argument that Obama did what he could, but Republicans in Congress, even when they played lip service to governing, were never on the level about being genuinely constructive partners.\n\nThe last governor standing brags about how good the economy is under Obama. Well, John Kasich may not say those words but most of his rationale revolves around his record in Ohio.\n\nBehind his talking points is an immutable fact: Ohio is doing well, just like the rest of the country, is in no small part because Barack Obama is President.\n\nFederal policies championed by President Obama have dramatically increased domestic oil production in places like Ohio. Kasich\u2019s Ohio got a big boost by participating in the Affordable Care Act\u2019s Medicare expansion. And the auto rescue. I could go on...\n\nThe Republican front-runner has been peddling the least subtle subtext. Donald Trump , like so many of his supporters, has never been happy about having a black President. When he says \u201cmake America great again,\u201d Trump is harkening back to his last campaign \u2014 the one where he succeeded in convincing so many lemmings that Barack Obama was born in Kenya and therefore an illegitimate President.\n\nYep, Obama isn\u2019t on the ballot. But it\u2019s hard not to hear his name even when the candidates aren\u2019t saying it.\n\nWeiner represented Queens and Brooklyn in the City Council and U.S. Congress.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Anthony Weiner", "twitter": {"description": "President Obama comes up at every debate and just about every stump speech by all the candidates...", "title": "Anthony Weiner: 2016 is really all about Barack Obama", "url": "http://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/anthony-weiner-2016-barack-obama-article-1.2561812", "image": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2561811.1457735132!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/dem-2016-clintons-decision.jpg", "site": "@nydailynews", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-author": "Anthony Weiner", "parsely-type": "article", "sailthru.credits": "NEW YORK DAILY NEWS", "nydn_tags": "barack obama, 2016 election, hillary clinton, bernie sanders, ted cruz, marco rubio, john kasich, donald trump", "parsely-pub-date": "2016-03-14T09:00:00", "parsely-link": "http://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/anthony-weiner-2016-barack-obama-article-1.2561812", "parsely-title": "Anthony Weiner: 2016 is really all about Barack Obama", "sailthru.date": "2016-03-14T05:00:00-0400", "sailthru.title": "Anthony Weiner: 2016 is really all about Barack Obama", "nydn_section": "Opinion", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2561811.1457735132!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/dem-2016-clintons-decision.jpg", "description": "President Obama comes up at every debate and just about every stump speech by all the candidates...", "robots": "NOARCHIVE", "fb": {"admins": 1594068001, "app_id": 107464888913, "pages": 268914272540}, "msvalidate.01": "02916AAC0DA8B068EFE01D721E03ED7E", "parsely-section": "Opinion", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/NYDailyNews/"}, "sailthru.description": "President Obama comes up at every debate and just about every stump speech by all the candidates...", "viewport": "width=device-width, height=device-height, initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no", "og": {"site_name": "NY Daily News", "description": "President Obama comes up at every debate and just about every stump speech by all the candidates...", "title": "Anthony Weiner: 2016 is really all about Barack Obama", "url": "http://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/anthony-weiner-2016-barack-obama-article-1.2561812", "image": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2561811.1457735132!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/dem-2016-clintons-decision.jpg", "type": "article"}, "parsely-tags": "barack obama, 2016 election, hillary clinton, bernie sanders, ted cruz, marco rubio, john kasich, donald trump", "p": {"domain_verify": "78efe4f5c9935744af497772f68a0ee7"}, "nydn_byline": "Anthony Weiner", "parsely-image-url": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2561811.1457735132!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/dem-2016-clintons-decision.jpg"}, "article_summary": "But to the rest of the world, his proud obstructionism points out how amazing it is that President Obama got anything done at all.\nPresident Obama comes up at every debate and just about every stump speech by all the candidates on both sides of the aisle.\nYep, Obama isn\u2019t on the ballot.\nFederal policies championed by President Obama have dramatically increased domestic oil production in places like Ohio.\nBut Sanders is saying that the \u201chalf a loaf\u201d doctrine of Bill Clinton and Barack Obama should be repudiated in favor of something bolder."}
