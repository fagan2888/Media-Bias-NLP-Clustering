But, like millions of other children across India, he has been forced out of school and into a job to help his impoverished family.\n\nDespite the country\u2019s rapid economic growth, child labor remains widespread in India, where an estimated 13 million children work, with laws meant to keep kids in school and out of the workplace routinely flouted.\n\nSatyarthi, who won the Peace Prize on Friday along with 17-year-old Pakistani Malala Yousafzai, accepts that \u201ca lot of work still remains\u201d before children like Raja no longer have to work.\n\nRaja dropped out of school in second grade, when he was handed over to the owner of a tea stall in the eastern city of Patna to pay off his father\u2019s 5,000 rupee ($80) debt. The money was needed because Raja\u2019s mother was sick.\n\nHe has no idea what a Nobel Prize even means. And he has no idea when his father\u2019s debt will be repaid so he can go back to his village.\n\nAcross India, children \u2014 some as young as 5 or 6 \u2014 end up working in all sorts of jobs. Many, like Raja, are in bonded labor, bound to their employers in exchange for a loan and unable to leave while in debt, which can last forever.\n\nOthers, like 13-year-old Srabani Das, need money so their impoverished families can eat.\n\nSrabani, still a child herself, is a baby sitter for a middle-class family\u2019s 1-year-old girl in the eastern city of Kolkata.\n\nIt\u2019s a job she has had for a year and which pays only about 800 rupees ($13) a month, which she sends home to her family of poor farm laborers. Srabani lives with her employers, and has no fixed work days or time off.\n\nSrabani has heard of the Nobel Prize, thanks to receiving a bit more of an education than Raja after studying up to the sixth grade.\n\nShe was happy that an Indian had won the award, but added, \u201cIt won\u2019t change my life.\u201d\n\nFor more than three decades, Satyarthi and the organization that he founded, Bachpan Bachao Andolan, or Save the Children Movement, has worked to rescue children like Raja and create awareness to keep others like Srabani in school.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Activist\u2019s Nobel highlights child labor in India", "title": "Activist\u2019s Nobel highlights child labor in India", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Activist\u2019s Nobel highlights child labor in India", "title": "Activist\u2019s Nobel highlights child labor in India", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/10/11/activists_nobel_highlights_child_labor_in_india/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/10/india-nobel-peace-prize.jpeg1-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Activist\u2019s Nobel highlights child labor in India", "title": "Activist\u2019s Nobel highlights child labor in India", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/10/india-nobel-peace-prize.jpeg1-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Indrajit Singh and Muneeza Naqvi", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdfd77\"", "article_summary": "Across India, children \u2014 some as young as 5 or 6 \u2014 end up working in all sorts of jobs.\nHe has no idea what a Nobel Prize even means.\nSrabani has heard of the Nobel Prize, thanks to receiving a bit more of an education than Raja after studying up to the sixth grade.\nDespite the country\u2019s rapid economic growth, child labor remains widespread in India, where an estimated 13 million children work, with laws meant to keep kids in school and out of the workplace routinely flouted.\nBut, like millions of other children across India, he has been forced out of school and into a job to help his impoverished family."}
