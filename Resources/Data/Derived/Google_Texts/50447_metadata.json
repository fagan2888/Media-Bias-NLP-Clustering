The United Nations\u2019 Iran vote just did.\n\nThe United Nations is apparently the \u201cUnCongress,\u201d kind of like the \u201cuncola,\u201d a lighter, refreshing alternative to your usual soft drink.\n\nWhy bother dealing with the heavy aftertaste of the Republicans in Congress on the Iran deal when you can get instant, unanimous approval for world peace from the UN Security Council?\n\nObama defied prominent members of his own party in Congress in getting the early UN stamp of approval. They include Sen. Ben Cardin of Maryland, co-architect this year with Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker, R-Tenn., of the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act, the title of which now seems just as preposterous as the Affordable Care Act.\n\nAs we have urged, Congress can and must dissect this awful deal before the eyes of the American public. Experts must expose its many fatal flaws in hearings before many committees, and there must be a long, serious debate on the Senate and House floors.\n\nBut let no one doubt that Obama will use the unanimous Security Council vote as heavy leverage against Congress, especially in persuading the more important members of his party to support this surrender to the world\u2019s foremost terrorism financier state.\n\nObama national security aide Ben Rhodes \u2014 whose claims in April about \u201canyplace, anytime\u201d inspections in Iran were just disavowed by Secretary of State John Kerry \u2014 announced the launch of @TheIranDeal, \u201ca Twitter account that is dedicated to delivering the facts and answering your questions about the Iran deal and how it enhances American national security.\u201d\n\nSo the propaganda offensive begins.\n\nEyes must be focused especially keenly on Chuck Schumer, the liberal New Yorker and longtime supporter of Israel who is set to realize his dream of becoming the Democrats\u2019 leader in the U.S. Senate.\n\nThe Brooklynite is one of the shrewdest politicians in Washington, ran fundraising for Senate Democrats in the successful 2006 and 2008 elections, and adores receiving federal money for New York State.\n\nSchumer has the ability over the 60 days before Congress votes to lead a large group of Democrats in revolt against the Iran deal; a bunch of incumbent senators owes him a lot. Preventing him from doing so will cost Obama a lot, but the smart money is on Schumer being able to be bought.\n\nAs Senate Minority Leader and a perennial shoe-in for re-election in a dependably blue state, he\u2019ll have little to fear from AIPAC and the rest of the pro-Israel lobby.\n\nOverriding an Obama veto would take two-thirds of both Houses, which is close to impossible. The best that the majority Republicans can hope for is better than 50%, which would blemish the appeasement pact by having it opposed by most of the American people\u2019s representatives.\n\nBut what does the will of mere Americans matter when you\u2019ve got the UN?
