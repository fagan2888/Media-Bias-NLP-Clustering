Mario Diaz-Balart, R-Fla., who traveled to Honduras and Guatemala over the weekend with members of the House GOP working group including its leader, Rep. Kay Granger of Texas. \u201cTime is of the essence.\u201d\n\nGranger, Diaz-Balart and others said their proposals would include sending the National Guard to help overwhelmed Border Patrol agents, increasing immigration judges, adding assistance to Central American nations and changing a 2008 trafficking victims law that guarantees hearings for Central American youths. The law has the practical result of letting the young people stay in the country for years as their cases move through the badly backlogged immigration courts.\n\nAt the same time Republicans are working to significantly pare down President Barack Obama\u2019s $3.7 billion emergency spending request for the border, hoping to act quickly on a smaller spending bill along with the package of policy changes. The recommendations were to be formally released later in the week, but lawmakers discussed their broad outlines Tuesday.\n\nIn response, Democrats and immigration advocates called for quick action on a \u201cclean\u201d spending bill without controversial policy changes attached. The White House urged speed, but did not insist that Congress act only on the spending bill.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s already been ample opportunity for Congress to take action, and we want to encourage them to move forward with some sense of urgency,\u201d said White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., declared that: \u201cWith this money, we can take care of the problem.\u201d\n\nRepublicans made clear that was out of the question.\n\n\u201cWhat I will not do is vote for a blank check for the president for something that will not solve the problem,\u201d said Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, who has written a bill along with fellow Texan Rep. Henry Cuellar, a moderate Democrat, to make some of the same changes the House working group is proposing.\n\nGranger said the average immigration case takes a year-and-a-half to five years to go through the court process, even as more than 57,000 unaccompanied children have arrived at the border since October. \u201cThat\u2019s just not acceptable so we\u2019ve got to change that,\u201d she said.\n\nWith Republicans refusing to support a border spending bill without major policy changes attached, and Democrats refusing to support one with them, any final outcome was unclear with November midterm elections around the corner.\n\nMeanwhile the children keep coming, with 90,000 expected by the end of the fiscal year. They flee violence, but also are drawn by rumors that once here, they can stay.\n\nProposed changes to the 2008 trafficking victims law have emerged as a major point of contention.\n\nThe House GOP proposal would allow youths from Central America and other countries to be treated the same under the law as Mexican children, who can be turned around quickly by Border Patrol agents unless they\u2019re able to make the case that they have a fear of return and require further screening.\n\nImmigration advocates and some Democrats contend that the Border Patrol screenings are cursory and inadequate and that the young people will be returned to gang violence and worse.\n\n\u201cA shotgun proceeding in which people are railroaded through a quick process for kids who have no idea what\u2019s going on is not how America does refugee protection, is not how America treats its kids,\u201d said Frank Sharry, executive director of America\u2019s Voice, an advocacy group.\n\nObama administration officials have indicated support for changing the 2008 law, but the White House has not proposed a specific fix amid complaints from advocacy groups, and its position about what it would accept is unclear.\n\nMeanwhile opposition among Democrats to any changes in the law appears to have hardened after earlier signals from Democratic leaders that they could support changes as the price for GOP support for Obama\u2019s emergency spending bill.\n\nReid, who last week left the door open to changing the law, said Tuesday: \u201cMy personal belief is that the law that has created some of the controversy now, there\u2019s enough, there\u2019s leeway there that the executive branch of government doesn\u2019t need new legislation.\u201d\n\nIt all comes at the same moment that Obama declared legislative efforts to overhaul the nation\u2019s immigration system dead in Congress, and announced plans to act on his own authority to make changes where he can.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Meanwhile the children keep coming, with 90,000 expected by the end of the fiscal year.
