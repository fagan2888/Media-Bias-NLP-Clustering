This wonder drug allows the immune system to destroy cancerous cells by efficiently recognizing them. Reports also suggest that it showed great promise amongst the 87% of the patients. After participating in this clinical trial, patients\u2019 tumors showed a complete or partial remission.\n\nResults attained during the course of these trials possibly reflect that Nivolumab may be one of the most potential treatments to increase the capability of the immune system in order to effectively identify and kill cancerous cells. Furthermore, trials conducted using the same aforementioned techniques in other types of cancers have also showed promising results in a separate study.\n\nThis wonder drug has been approved by the U.S Food and Drug Administration FDA and is already considered as a revolutionary drug in curtailing Hodgkin\u2019s Lymphoma.\n\nThe study was led by Margaret Shipp and Philippe Armand and 23 patients who had resistant forms of Hodgkin\u2019s Lymphoma participated. In essence the disease attacks white blood cells called lymphocytes and subsequently the bone marrow as well. It is the most common form of cancer in children and teenagers but overall less than 10,000 cases are registered in the U.S annually.\n\n80 percent of the patients participating in the study had already undergone stem cell transplants but more than one third of them eventually relapsed. After six months 20 out of 23 patients tumors sizes shrank exponentially. Four of them were declared cancer free while the rest of them continue to show progress even after a year.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "fda, hodgkin's lymphoma, nivolumab, u.s, wonder drug against cancer", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.3", "og": {"site_name": "Capital Wired", "description": "Follow After the conduction of many successful clinical trials on patients suffering from Hodgkin\u2019s Lymphoma, researchers have revealed that they believe Nivolumab is the obvious new weapon of choice in the fight against cancer.
