It will have a tangible benefit for our communities, local economies and small businesses,\" Ann Marie Cunningham of Jane Addams Senior Caucus, part of the Raise Chicago group, said in a statement.\n\nThe fast-tracked plan, one of three wage-increase proposals considered by city officials this week, is backed by Mayor Rahm Emanuel in what some critics say is a political move designed to win favor with left-leaning Chicago voters ahead of the February 2015 mayoral election.\n\nEmanuel applauded the city council's Tuesday vote in a statement. \"A higher minimum wage ensures that nobody who works in the City of Chicago will ever struggle to reach the middle class or be forced to raise their child in poverty,\" he said. \"Today, Chicago has shown that our City is behind a fair working wage.\"\n\nThe council\u2019s 19-member Workplace Development and Audit Committee had approved the plan Monday, with only three \u201cno\u201d votes, despite business groups and a minority of aldermen -- including Ann Sather restaurants owner Tom Tunney -- saying the plan will kill jobs and hurt business in the city.\n\n\"How do you go from $8.25 [an-hour] to $13 overnight?\u201d Tunney said Tuesday, according to the Chicago Sun-Times. \u201cYou know what you do? You raise the prices and you've also got to find ways to do it with less help. That's what's going to happen.\"\n\nSome activist groups and Emanuel rivals gearing up for the mayoral race say the $13-an-hour wage is not enough and have vowed to continue to push for a $15-an-hour minimum wage, an amount that an overwhelming majority of Chicago voters approved via a non-binding ballot question in the March primary election.\n\n\"While I\u2019m proud to support today\u2019s increase in the minimum wage, we can\u2019t stop fighting now,\" Ald. Bob Fioretti, who is running for mayor, said in a Tuesday statement. \"Rahm Emanuel could\u2019ve pushed this legislation earlier, and he could\u2019ve pushed for $15 an hour today. The chant in the streets here and nationwide has been \u2018show me $15,\u2019 not \u2018show me $13 by 2019.\u2019\"\n\nCook County Commissioner Jesus \"Chuy\" Garcia, who is also running for mayor, questioned why the Emanuel administration did not push for a higher wage sooner. Garcia also backed a proposed $15-an-hour Chicago wage.\n\n\"Why didn't he support a minimum wage hike during his first year in office?\" Garcia said in a statement. \"Why does he want to wait another 5 years before raising everyone to $13 an hour?\"\n\nIn the November elections, a majority of Illinois voters cast ballots in favor of increasing the state minimum wage to $10 by 2015. Sixty-six percent of voters statewide approved the November ballot question, while 87 percent of Chicago voters voted in favor of the increase.\n\nChicago\u2019s move to increase its city minimum wage could have implications for the separate battle to boost the state minimum wage to $11 by 2017. As Crain\u2019s Greg Hinz reported Monday, the backing of business groups which had supported the statewide proposal was likely contingent on the law blocking the ability of Chicago and other cities to independently increase their minimum wages above the state wage.\n\nThe state minimum wage was a key issue in the state\u2019s contentious gubernatorial race, and there is continued tension as Republican Gov.-elect Bruce Rauner has urged the state legislature to avoid taking action on any major issues, particularly raising the minimum wage, until he takes office on Jan. 12.\n\nRauner, who is pushing for \u201cpro-job creation, pro growth reforms,\u201d such as changes to laws concerning workers compensation and state taxes in conjunction with a minimum wage increase, warned on Tuesday that the Chicago ordinance could make the city less competitive, the Chicago Tribune reports.\n\nDemocratic Gov. Pat Quinn had vowed to increase the minimum wage in Illinois, and lawmakers may choose to ignore Rauner\u2019s directive and approve such legislation during their fall veto session this week.\n\nChicago is home to approximately 400,000 minimum-wage workers, who will be directly impacted by Tuesday's vote.\n\nAlso on HuffPost: Countries With A Higher Minimum Wage Than U.S. Countries With A Higher Minimum Wage Than U.S.\n\n1 of 9 9.
