(AP Photo/Gerald Herbert)\n\nKINGSTON >> Whether Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders wins next month\u2019s Democratic presidential primary, a number of local Democratic leaders feel they\u2019re getting a good candidate.\n\nSome of those who have picked a side, though, say Sanders is their choice to be the next president of the United States.\n\n\u201cI think we have two really great candidates,\u201d Ulster County Legislator David Donaldson said Friday, adding that he had not yet decided who he would support in the April 19 primary. The Kingston Democrat said he could support either candidate, though he did say he happens to like Sanders and what the senator from Vermont talks about on the campaign trail.\n\nNot every one of Sanders\u2019 platform goals is attainable, though, Donaldson said. He also said Clinton, a former first lady and secretary of state under President Barack Obama, has a little more political experience.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWoodstock town Supervisor Jeremy Wilber said he also is undecided which Democratic candidate to support. He said he might not make a decision until he actually is in the process of marking his ballot.\n\n\u201cI think they both have great strengths,\u201d Wilber said. He said Sanders has brought topics to the table that needed to be discussed and that Clinton has a lot of experience. Both would nominate good candidates to the Supreme Court, he said.\n\nIn primary contests last week, Clinton secured wins in Virginia, Tennessee, Alabama, Georgia, Arkansas, Texas and Massachusetts, while Sanders won in Vermont, Oklahoma, Minnesota and Colorado. Many polls show Clinton leading the race in terms of the delegate count.\n\nUlster County Legislature Minority Leader Hector Rodriguez, D-New Paltz, said he is a Sanders supporter, but that he thinks extraordinarily highly of Clinton.\n\n\u201cI think we have to make some changes in this country, and I think Sen. Sanders\u2019 agenda best represents my values,\u201d Rodriguez said. He said, for instance, he is a big believer in single-payer health care, which Sanders said he supports. Rodriguez said he feels Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act was a great first step, but it was a first step.\n\nRodriguez said Sanders has a robust agenda, and that, even if he only accomplishes half of his goals, it will be a marked improvement for the country.\n\nDutchess County Legislator Joel Tyner, D-Clinton, said he is a strong Sanders supporter, not just for moral and integrity reasons, but because he believes the senator can win the presidency. He said a recent poll shows Sanders beating all the Republican Party candidates, including front-runner Donald Trump. While the polls showed Clinton also beating the GOP candidates, Sanders did so by a higher margin in the poll, Tyner said.\n\n\u201cSo, it\u2019s not just about a fight for the soul of the Democratic Party,\u201d Tyner said. \u201cIt\u2019s about who are the Democrats going to put up whose actually going to win this thing.\u201d He added that people are sick and tired of politics as usual and how the power structure of both major parties is being sold out to powerful, well-monied interests. Tyner said he has worked against that in his political career, while Sanders has worked against it his whole life.\n\nIn the town of Rhinebeck, Supervisor Elizabeth Spinzia said she did not want to comment on the primary beyond saying she remains undecided on a candidate.\n\nLivingston town Councilman Will Yandik, who is seeking the Democratic nomination in the 19th Congressional District race, also declined to comment on the primary.\n\nZephyr Teachout, who is seeking the Democratic nomination in the 19th Congressional District, declined to talk about the candidates in the presidential primary, but did say she was pleased to see their debates focused on substantive issues. Last December, Teachout endorsed Sanders in the presidential contest, calling him a \u201cfearless, experienced leader capable of seeing the truth and standing up to big private power, even when it is almost impossibly hard.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think primaries make candidates stronger,\u201d Teachout said, adding that the primaries give voters a choice and engages them in the process.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "News, Kingston news, NY news, US news, world news.", "title": "Some undecided area Democrats say they find plenty to like in Sanders and Clinton", "og": {"url": "http://www.dailyfreeman.com/general-news/20160305/some-undecided-area-democrats-say-they-find-plenty-to-like-in-sanders-and-clinton", "image": {"width": "1500px", "identifier": "http://www.dailyfreeman.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/DF/20160305/NEWS/160309826/AR/0/AR-160309826.jpg?Maxh=1500&Maxw=1500", "height": "1103px"}, "type": "article", "title": "Some undecided area Democrats say they find plenty to like in Sanders and Clinton"}, "twitter": {"domain": "dailyfreeman.com", "description": "KINGSTON >> Whether Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders wins next month\u2019s Democratic presidential primary, a number of local Democratic leaders feel they\u2019re getting a good candidate.", "title": "Some undecided area Democrats say they find plenty to like in Sanders and Clinton", "url": "http://www.dailyfreeman.com/general-news/20160305/some-undecided-area-democrats-say-they-find-plenty-to-like-in-sanders-and-clinton", "image": {"src": "http://www.dailyfreeman.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/DF/20160305/NEWS/160309826/AR/0/AR-160309826.jpg?Maxh=900&Maxw=900"}, "site": "@dailyfreeman", "app": {"id": {"ipad": "id551766152", "iphone": "id520227762", "googleplay": "com.spreedinc.providers.digitalfirstmedia.dailyfreeman"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "7051e795f40b676ce04748f545d28049"}, "keywords": "News, Kingston news, NY news, US news, world news.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "description": "KINGSTON >> Whether Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders wins next month\u2019s Democratic presidential primary, a number of local Democratic leaders feel they\u2019re getting a good candidate."}, "article_summary": "Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton addresses supporters at her Super Tuesday election night rally in Miami, Tuesday, March 1, 2016.\n(AP Photo/Gerald Herbert)KINGSTON >> Whether Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders wins next month\u2019s Democratic presidential primary, a number of local Democratic leaders feel they\u2019re getting a good candidate.\nWhile the polls showed Clinton also beating the GOP candidates, Sanders did so by a higher margin in the poll, Tyner said.\nSome of those who have picked a side, though, say Sanders is their choice to be the next president of the United States.\nHe said Sanders has brought topics to the table that needed to be discussed and that Clinton has a lot of experience."}
