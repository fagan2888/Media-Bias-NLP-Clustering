The Broncos listed six players with concussions on regular-season injury reports.\n\nReceiver Wes Welker and running back C.J. Anderson suffered concussions in the preseason, and safety David Bruton and left guard Orlando Franklin are currently in the concussion protocol leading to the Jan. 11 playoff game at Sports Authority Field at Mile High.\n\nMultiple concussed Broncos agreed that the protocol represented progress even as issues surfaced around the league with players remaining in games after suffering concussions.\n\nPer rules, players diagnosed with concussions must go through a mandatory return-to-play process involving observation, comparison to preseason baseline cognitive testing and physical exertion. Before resuming practice, a player must be cleared by the team doctor and an independent neurological consultant.\n\nAll Broncos interviewed said a third party is advantageous in the process.\n\n\u201cThey take a lot more precaution on it now. For sure, it helps (with an outside doctor). It\u2019s a conflict,\u201d Welker said. \u201cI feel like it\u2019s a lot easier to be more honest.\u201d\n\nWelker, 33, left in the second quarter Aug. 23 after absorbing a hit to the head from Houston Texans defensive back D.J. Swearinger, who drew a 15-yard penalty but was not fined. It represented Welker\u2019s third concussion in 10 months. He continues to wear a protective helmet with additional padding, which is available to all players.\n\nWelker joined Anderson, who suffered his concussion Aug. 7 against the Seattle Seahawks. The injury \u201cscared\u201d Anderson. He felt grateful that he took his preseason baseline testing seriously.\n\n\u201cThe protocol is on the right path. As a player you have to do something to help yourself too. I tried to do my best on the test to make it even harder to get back on the field,\u201d said Anderson, who also made another change to help himself after getting his concussion. \u201cI changed my helmet to a more padded one. When I get hit, I might get another one, but I feel a lot better with this helmet.\u201d\n\nBroncos receiver Emmanuel Sanders chose not to change his headgear after a vicious shoulder-to-helmet hit by St. Louis Rams safety Joe McLeod on Nov. 16. Sanders admitted he would have likely returned to that game if not for the protocol.\n\n\u201cObviously you don\u2019t want to go back out there not thinking you are OK,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cAs annoying as it is, it is beneficial to the training staff and the player. The player knows, \u2018I went through all this stuff and I know I am secure.\u2019 It\u2019s better than just going out there and saying, \u2018Am I doing the right thing? Am I just doing this because of the love of the game?\u2019 It takes everything out of the training staff\u2019s hands and the player\u2019s hands and puts it in the hands of the doctor, and that\u2019s how it\u2019s supposed to be.\u201d\n\n\u201cMore care can be given\u201d\n\nThe league received criticism of its handling of concussions after the Broncos-San Diego Chargers game Oct. 23. In a memo obtained by Fox Sports and other media outlets, four top doctors connected to the NFL and NFL Players Association instructed team doctors that they could improve in their following of the concussion guidelines.\n\n\u201cWe have generally been pleased with the care provided to players who have suffered concussions in both the preseason and during the first part of the regular season,\u201d the memo from the doctors read. \u201cThat said, there remain occasional examples of where more care can be given to adhering to the relevant protocols. Each concussion is a serious injury and must be treated conservatively. All concussion symptoms must be taken seriously by medical staffs and players alike.\u201d\n\nThe doctors wrote the memo after an uneasy scene involving San Diego safety Jahleel Addae. Addae tackled Sanders hard, falling to the turf. He was diagnosed with a stinger and returned to the game. He then appeared disoriented following a shoulder hit on Broncos running back Juwan Thompson.\n\nHe was later diagnosed with a concussion. According to \u201cFrontline,\u201d the NFL and NFLPA conducted an investigation and identified no problems with the guidelines or the Chargers\u2019 medical staff. The issue, the probe determined, was that a press box spotter \u2014 a mandatory athletic trainer jointly hired by the league and union who has access to multiple video views and replay to aid in recognition of an injury \u2014 overlooked Addae\u2019s troubling physical reaction to the hit on Thompson.\n\nUnknowing victims\n\n\n\nIn a competitive environment where playing time and contracts remain at stake, it\u2019s not hard to see why a player might attempt to hide a concussion. Or in tight end Virgil Green\u2019s case \u2014 he suffered a concussion at Seattle in the regular season \u2014 why he didn\u2019t believe he had one.\n\n\u201cI felt like I could fight through it. Greek (Broncos trainer Steve Antonopulos) and his staff wanted me to sit. To me, unless you are drilling on yourself it\u2019s not a concussion. That\u2019s how my brain processes things. Greek was like, \u2018No, no, you are done. Start doing the protocol tests,\u2019 \u201d Green explained. \u201cI didn\u2019t think it was enough to see a doctor. That\u2019s just me. They stopped me.\u201d\n\nGreen and Broncos rookie receiver Cody Latimer called the protocol difficult. Green compared the cognitive testing to \u201cstudying for the SAT\u201d in college. Green currently uses Lumosity and Elevate each morning, brain-training games to improve his memory and focus. Latimer missed two games because of a concussion suffered during a practice rep.\n\n\u201cI got through the whole practice and went through meetings and the next day doing drills, I was like, \u2018Nah, this isn\u2019t feeling right,\u2019 \u201d Latimer said. \u201cIt was tough to get back out there. I thought I had passed the tests easily. But they were cautious and looking out for me. I came back feeling amazing, so what they did was right.\u201d\n\nTroy E.
