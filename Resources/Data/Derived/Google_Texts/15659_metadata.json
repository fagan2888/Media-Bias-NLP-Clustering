Andrew Nelson: Will you help end genocide of Christians in Middle East?\n\n\n\nImagine sitting home one day when suddenly you hear loudspeakers screaming from cars outside. With a hate-filled militancy, soldiers declare you must abandon your faith and pay a tax that is more than the value of your home, or leave. You are told you have one hour to decide.\n\n..\n\nTo stay is to die, but so is to leave. As you try to decide what to do, you hear your beloved elderly neighbor arguing with the soldiers, explaining that this is not how we are meant to live, and then you hear a shot and the screams of his daughters as they are taken away.\n\n..\n\nLooking at your own two young girls, you grab your family, your elderly parents, and you run, making your way into the desert with little food, water or hope. Your girls, should the terrorists get hold of them, will be sold as sex slaves, their prices listed online. As your heart breaks to the uncertain future that lies ahead, and as it mourns all that has already been lost, you scream for the world that moves by, you scream because you feel someone must break the silence.\n\n..\n\nJames Foley, journalist and parishioner of Holy Rosary Parish in Rochester, broke the silence with his pen and lens, bravely telling the story of suffering people. His captors mocked his faith, and he suffered death because of it, but he was not silent. His voice and his witness continue to speak and to challenge our hearts.\n\n..\n\nSermed Ashkouri, a Syriac Catholic Iraqi man living with his family in Nashua, has not been silent either. He tells the story of ISIL's targeting of his home parish in Baghdad, Our Lady of Salvation, and of the deaths of members of his own family. This past summer, he brought his young children to the church in Baghdad, the church of his baptism, and they saw the blood-stained walls that tell the story of an ISIL massacre. He wanted his children to see where many in their family died because they refused to be silent, because they refused to give up their faith.\n\n..\n\nEven as the beauty of autumn in New Hampshire arrives, the horror of genocide continues unabated in the Middle East. Christians, Yazidis, Sabea-Mandeans, Kurds, Kaka'e and Turkmen are relentlessly persecuted.\n\n..\n\nCoptic Christians in Egypt, Ethiopia and Eretria are targeted with increasing ferocity. Iraq, which boasted 1.5 million Christians a decade ago, today has fewer than 200,000.\n\n\n\nThe world has watched as one-third of Syria's Christian population has fled, and Iraq's fledgling Yazidi community is in ruin. The religious minorities that once flourished in a vibrant and diverse Middle East, existing for centuries before Islam's arrival, are fast disappearing.\n\n..\n\nThe world would be wise to wake up and realize the solution is not in the widespread redistribution of peoples, but rather in eradicating the very violent extremism at its source. At every level, our leaders must recognize the genocide that is happening in the Middle East and unite to stop it.\n\n..\n\nA small step forward was made this month when House Concurrent Resolution 75 was introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives, calling for the United States to recognize what is happening at the hands of ISIL as genocide.\n\n..\n\nReps. Annie Kuster and Frank Guinta co-sponsored this resolution and wrote to the White House asking the President to fill the office of State Department Special Envoy for Religious Minorities in the Near East and Southeast Asia, which has sat vacant since being created more than a year ago.\n\n..\n\nSen. Kelly Ayotte is leading the way in the Senate by co-sponsoring similar legislation. Sen. Jeanne Shaheen has written to the State Department to seek swifter action on behalf of refugees and religious minorities. Our congressional delegation refuses to be silent, and we should do the same.\n\n..\n\nDespite ISIL's targeting of Christian and religious minorities, the State Department refuses to grant these communities expedited and preferential treatment in the processing of visa requests. In the last year, the State Department granted nearly 1,000 visas to Syrians, only 28 of whom were Christians. In Iraq, only one out of every seven visas being granted is to Christians.\n\n..\n\nChristians face a double-edged sword: ISIL persecution on one hand and the State Department's reluctance to specifically help the most targeted religious minorities on the other.\n\n\n\nIn New Hampshire, we have a chance to make a difference. All of us can raise our voices and ask presidential candidates what they will do to stop the genocide of religious minorities in the Middle East.\n\n..\n\nThis primary season, may the good people of New Hampshire not be defined by conversations about The Donald's hair, but rather by the voice we use to speak for our brothers and sisters who suffer in silence.\n\n..\n\nThe Rev. Andrew Nelson is vicar of the Good Shepherd and Holy Family parishes in Berlin and Gorham.\n\n..", "article_metadata": {"description": "The world has watched as one-third of Syria's Christian population has fled, and Iraq's fledgling Yazidi community is in ruin.
