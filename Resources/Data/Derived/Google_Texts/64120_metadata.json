In 2013, 88.7 percent of eligible youngsters were enrolled. In 2008, enrollment was at 81.7 percent, the report showed.\n\nToday, more than half of states have Medicaid/CHIP participation rates of more than 90 percent. States that expanded Medicaid for adults had the largest gains in Medicaid/CHIP participation, the researchers noted. The researchers suggested that parents who received new coverage under Medicaid may have learned more about the options available to their children.\n\nOf the remaining 4.5 million uninsured children in the United States, more than 60 percent were eligible for Medicaid/CHIP in 2014, the researchers said.\n\nIn states that expanded Medicaid, about 5 percent of eligible children were uninsured in 2014. In states that didn't expand coverage, about 8 percent of children were uninsured.\n\nThe U.S. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services provides more information on the Children's Health Insurance Program.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2016 HealthDay.
