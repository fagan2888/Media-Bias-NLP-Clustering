Bruce Braley is not listening to these voters. He is listening to Barack Obama and that is not acceptable to the voters of Iowa.\u201d\n\nSam Clovis is running for the U.S. Senate seat being vacated by Sen.Tom Harkin. Sam holds a MBA in Management and a Doctorate in Public Administration. He is currently a tenured full professor at a private liberal arts college in northwest Iowa. He served in the United States Air Force for 25 years and still provides leadership to defense and homeland security institutions. He lives in Hinton, IA with his wife Charlotte and stepson Khan.
