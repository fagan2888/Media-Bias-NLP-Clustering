Two-pound hunk of smoked succulence. Tester of whether growling stomachs can match wide eyes.\n\nAt A Taste of Colorado on Monday, 9-year-old Kathy Melendez held hers in a two-fisted grip so tight it suggested that if she removed one hand, the leg might tip her over. After all, it was roughly one-quarter her height.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m going to finish it all,\u201d she said, sizing up the leg.\n\nThis year\u2019s A Taste of Colorado \u2014 which ended Monday after a four-day run \u2014 was a feast for the ambitious. Organizers estimated about 500,000 people attended the festival, in line with last year\u2019s attendance.\n\nAmong the tastes of A Taste of Colorado \u2014 jerk chicken and grilled corn and ice cream and sausages \u2014 the turkey leg reigned supreme in the hands of young and old, little and big. And that hinted at the culinary combat taking place beneath the jolly atmosphere.\n\nTwo booths were selling turkey legs this year.\n\nThey set up on opposite sides of Civic Center; they charged the same amount. And they were both insistent they smoked the best bird.\n\n\u201cWe cook them really, really slow, after brining them in our special marinade,\u201d said Rick Seewald, whose Sweet Lorraine\u2019s Catering was on the east side of the festival.\n\n\u201cAll you have to do is look at them,\u201d said Christian Aznar of The Goods Smoke and Grill \u2014 the festival\u2019s west-side turkey leggery. \u201cCrispy brown crust. Inside is nice and tender.\u201d\n\nSeewald said he might sell 5,000 turkey legs this year. He orders them months in advance.\n\n\u201cYou just can\u2019t go pick up a bunch of turkey legs,\u201d he said.\n\nAnd that, perhaps, explains the appeal. Like an orchid in bloom\u2014 a turkey leg comes around only so often.\n\n\u201cI come every year,\u201d said Cherell Allen, Kathy Melendez\u2019s neighbor, \u201cjust to get a turkey leg.\u201d\n\nJohn Ingold: 303-954-1068, jingold@denverpost.com or twitter.com/john_ingold", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Half million attend A Taste of Colorado over Labor Day weekend", "title": "Half million attend A Taste of Colorado over Labor Day weekend", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2013/09/02/half-million-attend-a-taste-of-colorado-over-labor-day-weekend/", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20130902__BN20130903_Z00_BNCD02TASTEWRAPp3.jpg", "height": 418}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20130902__BN20130903_Z00_BNCD02TASTEWRAPp3.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2013-09-02T17:47:05+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-28T13:59:05+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc22f\"", "article_summary": "Like an orchid in bloom\u2014 a turkey leg comes around only so often.\nInside is nice and tender.\u201dSeewald said he might sell 5,000 turkey legs this year.\n\u201cYou just can\u2019t go pick up a bunch of turkey legs,\u201d he said.\nThis is an ode to the turkey leg.\nThis year\u2019s A Taste of Colorado \u2014 which ended Monday after a four-day run \u2014 was a feast for the ambitious."}
