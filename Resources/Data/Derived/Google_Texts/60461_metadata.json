Consequently, the congressional Republicans have voted dozens of times to repeal the Affordable Care Act even though the original architects of the most controversial parts of the law were Republicans Mitt Romney, Bob Dole and Chuck Grassley. Likewise, Rand Paul, \u201cthe most interesting man in politics,\u201d once filibustered Obama\u2019s use of predator drones on American citizens overseas while later suggesting that drones should be used against American liquor store thieves. More recently, the GOP has resurrected its terrorism fearmongering from the early 2000s, including its determination that constitutional liberties are irrelevant in the face of the ISIS threat, even though just two years ago, the Republicans loudly assaulted Obama for continuing the NSA surveillance operations established and endorsed post-9/11 by those very Republicans.\n\nWe could spend days listing the roster of GOP contradictions. Regarding terrorism and liberty, you might recall how, during the post-9/11 era, the GOP established itself as the counterterrorism party \u2014 the only party that\u2019d \u201csmoke out the evildoers.\u201d In the process, the Republicans branded themselves as the Patriotism Party while scolding the unpatriotic behavior of everyone from Max Cleland to Natalie Maines to Bill Maher after they dared to criticize the Bush administration\u2019s motives and means.\n\nFast forward to 2015 when the GOP\u2019s kneejerk patriotism isn\u2019t as rock-solid as they led us all to believe. It turns out the GOP\u2019s superhero jingoism is rendered impotent in the face of Wayne LaPierre and the National Rifle Association. Given the choice between making sure suspected terrorists can\u2019t buy firearms in the United States \u2014 a position that ought to be mandatory for a \u201csmoking out the evildoers\u201d platform \u2014 or to make sure they don\u2019t piss off the sacrosanct gun lobby, the Republican Party has mostly chosen the latter. In other words, a not insignificant number of Republicans have refused to close a loophole in the background check system that allows suspected terrorists to buy firearms.\n\nIndeed, the GOP is actively characterizing President Obama as weak on terrorism, even though the GOP itself is nothing more than a herd of fainting goats when it comes to opposing the NRA on background checks and the gun gap.\n\nSince word of the loophole broke following the ISIS attacks in Paris, The New York Daily News has launched a front-page headline campaign intended to humiliate the NRA and its Republican minions. It\u2019s about time the traditional press called it like it is: the Republican Party, as well as too many Democrats, are owned by the NRA.\n\nAs of right now, a bill to close the \u201cgun gap\u201d loophole, the Denying Firearms and Explosives to Dangerous Terrorists Act, has been stalled in committee since February of this year in spite of the rise of ISIS. One of the few Republican co-sponsors of this year\u2019s bill, Pete King, lamented the almost complete lack of GOP support. \u201cTo be honest with you, I don\u2019t see much enthusiasm on the Republican side,\u201d the New York Republican said late last week, \u201cIt\u2019s one battle at a time.\u201d And most of those battles are lost to LaPierre and his relentless band of gun lobby stooges.", "article_metadata": {"description": "For all their bluster about keeping the country safe, Republicans are proving themselves unwilling to cross the NRA", "title": "GOP \u201cpatriotism\u201d is a sick joke: Here\u2019s proof that Republican allegiance is really to the NRA", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "For all their bluster about keeping the country safe, Republicans are proving themselves unwilling to cross the NRA", "title": "GOP \u201cpatriotism\u201d is a sick joke: Here\u2019s proof that Republican allegiance is really to the NRA", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/11/24/gop_patriotism_is_a_sick_joke_heres_proof_that_republican_allegiance_is_really_to_the_nra/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/05/wayne_lapierre5.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "For all their bluster about keeping the country safe, Republicans are proving themselves unwilling to cross the NRA", "title": "GOP \u201cpatriotism\u201d is a sick joke: Here\u2019s proof that Republican allegiance is really to the NRA", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/05/wayne_lapierre5.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Bob Cesca", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Gun Control, gun safety, Guns, Terrorism, The NRA, The Republican Party", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Topics: Gun Control, gun safety, Guns, Terrorism, The NRA, The Republican Party, News, Politics NewsThe Republican Party of 2015 will surely be defined by future historians and political scientists as the party of obvious cognitive dissonance.\nIt\u2019s about time the traditional press called it like it is: the Republican Party, as well as too many Democrats, are owned by the NRA.\nOne of the few Republican co-sponsors of this year\u2019s bill, Pete King, lamented the almost complete lack of GOP support.\nFast forward to 2015 when the GOP\u2019s kneejerk patriotism isn\u2019t as rock-solid as they led us all to believe.\nIt turns out the GOP\u2019s superhero jingoism is rendered impotent in the face of Wayne LaPierre and the National Rifle Association."}
