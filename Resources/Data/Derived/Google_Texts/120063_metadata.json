The agency, however, says it's \"not aware\" of any such undercover work that has been conducted \"specifically to gain information from a privileged relationship.\"\n\nStill, Pat Mahoney of the Christian Defense Coalition remains wary, telling OneNewsNow that because the potential exists, Christians might be talking to someone who appears to be a pastor yet be actually revealing information to an undercover agent.\n\nMahoney\n\n\"[Those] agents may be going to rallies and events and services and meetings posing as clergymen but are actually gathering information on and spying on people of faith,\" he summarizes. The rule allowing such undercover operations was put into effect in 2012 under President Obama.\n\nMahoney argues that it's the role of government and its agents to protect the First Amendment right to freedom of religion, not to spy on those exercising it.\n\n\"The IRS has come under blistering criticism and congressional hearings for the fact that they have been used to attack primarily conservative organizations and groups who disagree with President Obama,\" he points out.\n\nIn addition, the IRS will be enforcing regulations and fines regarding ObamaCare, which is being contested in court by many Christian organizations. In light of that, Mahoney wonders how information gathered from IRS undercover work as pastors might be used.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://onenewsnow.com/church/2014/11/20/irs-agents-posing-as-pastors-it-could-happen", "image": {"width": 800, "identifier": "http://onenewsnow.com/images/ogimage.jpg", "height": 500}, "description": "A Christian activist in America&#39;s capital is warning fellow believers that the Internal Revenue Service may be crossing the line in terms of involving itself in religion.", "title": "IRS agents posing as pastors?
