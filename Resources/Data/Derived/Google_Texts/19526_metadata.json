Holden was seeking the right to form a humanist study group, a right afforded prisoners of other faiths.\n\nUnder the settlement, the Federal Bureau of Prisons agreed to acknowledge humanism as a \u201cworldview\u201d and allow its adherents the same rights and recognition enjoyed by inmates of other faiths. Those rights include requesting time and space for activities, visits by pastors or other humanist chaplains and access to literature and study materials.\n\nHumanist inmates will also be able to celebrate \u201choly days,\u201d including Darwin Day, the annual observance of naturalist Charles Darwin\u2019s birthday on Feb. 12 that is now widely marked by humanist groups around the world.\n\nThe prison bureau also agreed to add a section on humanism to its handbook on inmate beliefs and practices.\n\nNo one knows how many of the 1.6 million U.S. inmates identify as humanist or any other faith, as the U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics rarely surveys inmates on their faith. The Pew Research Center surveyed prison chaplains in 2012 and they reported that efforts by inmates to proselytize or convert other inmates was common and often successful \u2014 three-fourths of the surveyed chaplains said there is a considerable amount of \u201creligious switching\u201d occurring in their prisons, especially among Muslims and Protestants.\n\nREAD: Oklahoma top court reaffirms Ten Commandments stone at Capitol must go\n\nHolden said in a radio interview that humanism is different from atheism and deserved recognition as a set of beliefs.\n\n\u201cAs humanists, we believe in the ability of mankind to transcend their differences and find some common ground,\u201d he said. \u201cYou know, make the world a better place.\u201d\n\nYS/AMB END WINSTON", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Beliefs, Culture, Ethics, Institutions, American Humanist Association, Federal Bureau of Prisons, Freethought (Atheist, Humanist, Agnostic), humanism, inmate, Jason Michael Holden", "generator": "Easy Digital Downloads v2.5.16", "og": {"site_name": "Religion News Service", "description": "(RNS) Under the settlement, the Federal Bureau of Prisons agreed to acknowledge humanism as a \u201cworldview\u201d and allow its adherents the same rights and recognition enjoyed by inmates of other faiths.", "title": "Federal prisons agree inmates can be \u2018humanists\u2019", "url": "http://religionnews.com/2015/07/28/federal-prisons-agree-inmates-can-humanists/", "image": "http://religionnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/thumbRNSPRISONCHAPLAINS080811b.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@RNS", "card": "summary", "creator": "@kjwinston11"}, "syndication-source": "http://religionnews.com/2015/07/28/federal-prisons-agree-inmates-can-humanists/", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://religionnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-RNS_logo_RGB-336x336.gif", "original-source": "http://religionnews.com/2015/07/28/federal-prisons-agree-inmates-can-humanists/", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "description": "(RNS) Under the settlement, the Federal Bureau of Prisons agreed to acknowledge humanism as a \u201cworldview\u201d and allow its adherents the same rights and recognition enjoyed by inmates of other faiths."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca7f3\"", "article_summary": "(RNS) The Federal Bureau of Prisons has agreed to recognize humanism as a religion after settling a lawsuit brought by an Oregon inmate.\nUnder the settlement, the Federal Bureau of Prisons agreed to acknowledge humanism as a \u201cworldview\u201d and allow its adherents the same rights and recognition enjoyed by inmates of other faiths.\nThe prison bureau also agreed to add a section on humanism to its handbook on inmate beliefs and practices.\nHumanist inmates will also be able to celebrate \u201choly days,\u201d including Darwin Day, the annual observance of naturalist Charles Darwin\u2019s birthday on Feb. 12 that is now widely marked by humanist groups around the world.\n\u201cAs humanists, we believe in the ability of mankind to transcend their differences and find some common ground,\u201d he said."}
