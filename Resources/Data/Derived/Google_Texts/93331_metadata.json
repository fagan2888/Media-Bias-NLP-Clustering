The dissenters essentially argued that the court was taking on a role of a law-making body rather than staying within the bounds of a judicial arbiter.\n\nScalia\u2019s complaint was that the U.S. Supreme Court, known as SCOTUS, went too far in upholding the Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare, and its tax breaks for Americans who purchase health insurance through federal exchanges.\n\n\u201cSo it rewrites the law to make tax credits available everywhere. We should start calling this law SCOTUScare,\u201d Scalia wrote in his dissent, saying Roberts\u2019 reasoning was an act of \u201cinterpretive jiggery-pokery.\u201d\n\nCanady was equally forceful in his criticism of the majority opinion written by Pariente that is directing lawmakers to redraw the state\u2019s congressional districts while offering specific guidelines on how the new districts should be shaped.\n\n\u201cThis decision causes serious damage to our constitutional structure,\u201d Canady wrote. \u201cThe proper functioning of the judicial process is deformed and the separation of powers is breached in an unprecedented manner.\u201d\n\nIn her opinion, Pariente called Canady\u2019s criticism \u201cextravagant.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe barrage of epithets employed by the dissent includes the following colorful array: \u2018fallacious;\u2019 \u2018fabricated;\u2019 \u2018extreme distortion;\u2019 \u2018revolutionary deformation;\u2019 \u2018teeming with judicial overreaching;\u2019 \u2018creatively cobbled;\u2019 \u2018aggressive invasion;\u2019 \u2018aberrant decision;\u2019 and \u2018unprecedented incursions,'\u201d Pariente wrote.\n\n\u201cPerhaps we should take solace in not being accused of \u2018jiggery-pokery,'\u201d Pariente added in a footnote.\n\nCOURT POLITICS\n\nBut there is a major difference between the nation\u2019s highest appellate court and Florida\u2019s top appellate court: the U.S. justices have lifetime appointments, while Florida justices face a mandatory retirement age.\n\nFour of the five justices who formed the 5-2 majority in the congressional case, and are viewed as the liberal wing of state court, will reach the retirement age of 70 in the next four years. Justice James E.C. Perry will end his current term in January 2017, allowing Gov. Rick Scott to replace him, most likely with a more conservative jurist.\n\nAnother epic Florida political battle may loom with the other three justices, Pariente, Fred Lewis and Peggy Quince, whose terms will end on Jan. 8, 2019, which happens to be the last day of Scott\u2019s second term.\n\nThe unresolved question is whether Scott will make the appointments to those three Supreme Court seats or whether it will be his successor.\n\nThe Legislature placed a constitutional amendment on the 2014 ballot that clarified the issue by giving the appointment power to the sitting governor, which in this case would be Scott. But voters rejected the measure.\n\nGiven the ideological divide that was evidenced by this week\u2019s congressional redistricting opinion, how those appointments are resolved will go a long way in determining who is accusing who of \u201cjiggery-pokery\u201d in future decisions.", "article_metadata": {"wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}, "description": "Florida Supreme Court's Barbara Pariente and Charles Canady exchange sharp differences of legal opinion.", "framework": "Alkivia Framework 0.8"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0caa\"", "article_summary": "In both cases, the dissenting justices, Scalia and Canady, accused the court majority of overstepping its bounds as an appellate court.\nCOURT POLITICSBut there is a major difference between the nation\u2019s highest appellate court and Florida\u2019s top appellate court: the U.S. justices have lifetime appointments, while Florida justices face a mandatory retirement age.\nTALLAHASSEE -- The U.S. Supreme Court has featured John Roberts and Antonin Scalia as dueling justices, exchanging sharp differences of legal opinion on major cases, including the most recent decision upholding the Affordable Care Act.\nAnother epic Florida political battle may loom with the other three justices, Pariente, Fred Lewis and Peggy Quince, whose terms will end on Jan. 8, 2019, which happens to be the last day of Scott\u2019s second term.\nThe unresolved question is whether Scott will make the appointments to those three Supreme Court seats or whether it will be his successor."}
