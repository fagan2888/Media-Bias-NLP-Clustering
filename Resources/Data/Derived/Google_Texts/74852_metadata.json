The idea of trading lower choice for lower health spending dates back decades in health care, and the model was gaining in popularity among insurers and employers several years before Obamacare\u2019s passage.\n\nBut narrow networks are at the heart of many of the new health plans rolled out through the ACA. The law\u2019s ambitious goals to simultaneously expand health coverage while keeping costs low forced insurers to push some providers to take less money \u2014 or push them out of networks altogether.\n\n\u201cThis is really the only way to get to the price point that I think everyone believes will be attractive to the consumer,\u201d MagnaCare CEO Joseph Berardo recently recently told NJBiz. \u201cYou\u2019re looking at a price point that could be 15 and 20 percent below the broader network.\u201d\n\nAll told, about half of the plans sold on HealthCare.gov and the other new insurance exchanges in 2014 were \u201cnarrow networks,\u201d McKinsey found.\n\nOn a broad scale, there\u2019s no reason to think that patients would be negatively affected. A number of studies have found that there\u2019s not much connection between provider choice and patient outcomes. Drew Harris at the Jefferson School of Population Health even suggests that a narrow network could lead to better provider teamwork \u2014 and potentially better care.\n\nAnd the thing is \u2014 as patients were briefed on the concept behind narrow networks, they grew to like them. According to a Kaiser Family Foundation tracking poll in February, most would-be exchange customers preferred narrow networks after they were told they could reduce their health spending by 25%.\n\nPatient Pushback and Peeved Plaintiffs\n\nBut the vision of narrow networks is encountering a more troublesome reality. In California, hundreds of residents have filed complaints against Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield of California, suggesting that the provider lists provided by Covered California are at best inaccurate and at worst misleading.\n\n\u201cI thought I had done everything right, and it\u2019s been awful,\u201d one cancer patient told Chad Terhune of the Los Angeles Times, after receiving an $8,000 bill. \u201cHow am I going to come up with that much money?\u201d\n\nA number of patients in remote areas also say they\u2019ve had problems finding specialists who take their new insurance.\n\nHaving been hit by unexpected bills, some unhappy patients have turned to the courts to try and seek resolution.\n\nA class-action lawsuit filed in May charges that individuals who purchased PPO plans from Blue Shield were misled by the number of providers who would actually be covered.\n\nThe plaintiffs specifically allege that they received numerous medical treatments this year between January and March but later discovered \u2014 thanks to exorbitant out-of-pocket spending \u2014 that their providers were not covered under their network.\n\n(It\u2019s not just patients who are suing, either. In Washington state, a lawsuit over whether Seattle Children\u2019s Hospital was unfairly excluded from narrow-network plans has dragged on for months.)\n\nThe broad surge in complaints has spurred regulators to get involved.\n\nCalifornia\u2019s Department of Managed Health Care is in the middle of a two-month investigation into the accuracy of provider lists provided by Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield of California. (See this California Healthline roundup for more detail.)\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s always going to be bumps along the way,\u201d acknowledged Shelley Rouillard, DMHC\u2019s director, \u201cbut the consumers who are purchasing coverage need to know that what they\u2019re buying is really being advertised correctly.\u201d\n\nThe findings won\u2019t be released for several weeks, but according to a DMHC spokesperson, the department\u2019s initial investigation \u201cgave us good cause to believe there are violations of the law.\u201d\n\nAround the nation\n\nHere\u2019s a quick look at what else is making news on the road to reform.\n\nCMS will examine whether Medicaid beneficiaries can find care: In a first, the agency plans to conduct national research into whether providers are accepting (or avoiding) patients covered by Medicaid, Virgil Dickson writes at Modern Healthcare.\n\nHealth care is more than care delivery: According to Elizabeth Bradley and Lauren Anne Taylor, authors of \u201cThe American Health Care Paradox: Why Spending More Is Getting Us Less,\u201d ignoring the social welfare \u2014 like nutritional programs and housing assistance \u2014 contributes to long-term health problems and the nation\u2019s higher spending.\n\nHow one insurer is trying to tamp down cancer spending: The Washington Post\u2018s Jason Millman examines United Healthcare\u2019s bundled-payment pilot program, finding that it successfully reined in overall costs\u2026but surprisingly raised spending on chemotherapy drugs.", "article_metadata": {"description": "<p>Complaints about the \"narrow networks\" in the Affordable Care Act's exchanges have taken a sharp turn, with regulators launching investigations and patients filing lawsuits.
