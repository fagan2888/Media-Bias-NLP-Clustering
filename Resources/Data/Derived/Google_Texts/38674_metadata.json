The influx in migrants has overwhelmed local resources as the Department of Homeland Security must process the minors, many whom could be eligible for refugees status.\n\nMaher starts his story with the following stanza:\n\nHowdy there, partner,\n\nToday is your day.\n\nYou made it to Brownsville!\n\nNow please go away.\n\nThe \u201cReal Time\u201d host also points out Republican\u2019s hypocrisy and racism in the parody:\n\nAnd just cuz you're here,\n\nDon't think that you beat us.\n\nCuz we don't love kids\n\nUnless they're a fetus. So cut us some slack,\n\nTurn that frown upside-down,\n\nIt's not our fault\n\nYou're a little too brown.\n\nMaher isn\u2019t the only late-night comedian to take a shot at Republicans\u2019 attitude towards child refugees. Jon Stewart asked conservatives \u201cWhat the fuck is wrong with you?\u201d in his \"Immigration Reform Crisis: Kids Edition\" segment earlier this month.\n\n\"We have always been a nation of immigrants who hate the newer immigrants,\" Stewart added, \"because Lady Liberty may be a beacon of those yearning to breathe free but the truth is, she's actually a bouncer.\"\n\nAlso on HuffPost: Bill Maher's Obamacare Ads Bill Maher's Obamacare Ads\n\n1 of 10 Share this slide:\n\nHBO", "article_metadata": {"description": "Oh, the places Bill Maher just went. \n\nThe host of HBO\u2019s \u201cReal Time\u201d took on the border crisis and Tea Party Republicans with an epic Dr. Seuss parody ...", "sailthru.expire_date": "2014-07-29 16:57:18 -0400", "og": {"site_name": "The Huffington Post", "description": "Oh, the places Bill Maher just went. \n\nThe host of HBO\u2019s \u201cReal Time\u201d took on the border crisis and Tea Party Republicans with an epic Dr. Seuss parody ...", "title": "WATCH: Bill Maher Bashes Republicans Over Border Crisis With Epic Dr. Seuss Parody", "url": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/07/28/bill-maher-dr-seuss-parody-border-crisis_n_5628016.html", "image": "http://i.huffpost.com/gen/1935201/images/o-BILL-MAHER-facebook.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Oh, the places Bill Maher just went. \n\nThe host of HBO\u2019s \u201cReal Time\u201d took on the border crisis and Tea Party Republicans with an epic Dr. Seuss parody ...", "creator": "CaritoJuliette", "image": {"width": 2000, "identifier": "http://i.huffpost.com/gen/1935201/images/o-BILL-MAHER-facebook.jpg", "height": 1000}, "title": "WATCH: Bill Maher Bashes Republicans Over Border Crisis With Epic Dr. Seuss Parody", "site": "@LatinoVoices", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-07-28 16:57:18 -0400", "al": {"ios": {"url": "huffpostnews:///?editionID=us&entryID=5628016", "app_store_id": 306621789, "app_name": "The Huffington Post"}}, "taboola.category": "latino-voices", "fb": {"app_id": 46744042133}, "keywords": "border crisis,bill maher border crisis,bill maher dr. seuss parody,lv-life,border crisis bill maher,Bill Maher HBO,child refugees,Real Time,bill maher child refugees,bill maher real time,bill maher,Latino politics,hbo real time", "article": {"section": "Latino Voices", "tag": "border crisis,bill maher border crisis,bill maher dr. seuss parody,lv-life,border crisis bill maher,Bill Maher HBO,child refugees,Real Time,bill maher child refugees,bill maher real time,bill maher,Latino politics,hbo real time", "published_time": "2014-07-28 16:57:18 -0400", "modified_time": "2014-07-31 11:59:04 -0400"}, "viewport": "width=1000"}, "article_summary": "The host of HBO\u2019s \u201cReal Time\u201d took on the border crisis and Tea Party Republicans with an epic Dr. Seuss parody on Friday night.\nOh, the places Bill Maher just went.\nDuring his \u201cNew Rules\u201d segment, Maher gave the author\u2019s classic story, \u201cOh, The Places You\u2019ll Go!\u201d a satirical twist to create \u201cOh, The Places You\u2019ll Go...and Get Kicked Out Of.\u201d The new story tackles the current border crisis.\nAlso on HuffPost: Bill Maher's Obamacare Ads Bill Maher's Obamacare Ads1 of 10 Share this slide:HBO\nMaher isn\u2019t the only late-night comedian to take a shot at Republicans\u2019 attitude towards child refugees."}
