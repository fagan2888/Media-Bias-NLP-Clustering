Four GOP Senate candidates have advocated for over-the-counter birth control, Colorado\u2019s Cory Gardner, Thom Tillis in North Carolina, Ed Gillespie in Virginia, and Mike McFadden in Minnesota. \u201cI actually agree with the American Medical Association that we should make contraception more widely available. I think over-the-counter oral contraception should be available without prescription,\u201d Tillis said last week in his first debate against Sen. Kay Hagan.\n\n\n\nLiberal groups, not wanting the GOP storyline to take hold, have come back swinging, accusing Republicans of engaging in a deception to fool women. On Monday, Democratic groups in Colorado launched a five-figure television ad campaign to push back on Gardner\u2019s embrace in a television ad last week of the policy proposal, arguing that the plan could raise out-of-pocket costs for women, since insurers who now provide no-cost contraception tend not to cover over-the-counter medication.\n\nThe controversy has put Democratic candidates in the odd position of seemingly opposing a policy proposal that voters are inclined to believe they support: the availability of birth control without a doctor\u2019s prescription. From Colorado to North Carolina, Democrats have rejected the proposal as a distraction, contending that it amounts to a clever way of undermining the new benefits provided under Obamacare.\n\nA spokesperson for Democrat Kay Hagan of North Carolina did not respond to a request to clarify whether she would support the over-the-counter proposal, while a spokesman for Mark Udall of Colorado and official with Planned Parenthood Action Fund said they would only consider the issue as long as it is coupled with maintaining insurance mandate. In Colorado, MoveOn and NARAL Pro-Choice America released a five-figure television buy against Gardner on the issue Monday.\n\nDemocrats and Republicans trace the political origins of the proposal, which has been pushed by doctors since at least 2012, to Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal. In a December 2012 Wall Street Journal op-ed, the 2016 presidential hopeful and former Assistant Secretary of Health and Human Services argued that contraceptives should be made available over the counter to increase access and bring down costs. \u201cAs an unapologetic pro-life Republican, I also believe that every adult (18 years old and over) who wants contraception should be able to purchase it,\u201d Jindal wrote, calling for \u201cthe end of birth-control politics.\u201d\n\nBecause it would be sold over the counter, Jindal argued that prices would be lower because of additional competition, while removing a doctor from the equation would make it easier for women to access it.\n\nIt was a shrewd policy proposal designed to provide Republican candidates a safety zone on the thorny subject of contraception. Most Republican candidates have objected to the contraception mandate in the Affordable Care Act which requires most employers\u2019 health insurance to cover birth control despite their religious beliefs. Republicans generally celebrated the Supreme Court ruling in June in the Hobby Lobby case that closely-held companies with religious objects could abstain from covering contraceptives.\n\nJindal\u2019s political aides, and many GOP operatives, believe birth control is a gateway issue for women voters. While the politics of abortion have remained consistently split, Republicans fear being cast as anti-birth control could cost them a generation of women voters. \u201cIt\u2019s often an immediate shutdown,\u201d said one Jindal aide.\n\nBut the simple proposal is hardly comprehensive, and is a long way from going into effect anyway. No birth control manufacturer has applied for an over-the-counter designation from the Food and Drug Administration, and only the contraceptive pill would be covered. If private plans didn\u2019t cover other forms of birth control, like IUDs, patients who use them would be forced to spend more out of pocket.\n\n\u201cIf Cory Gardner and others were serious about expanding access to birth control, they wouldn\u2019t be trying to repeal the no-copay birth control benefit, reduce Title X funding for birth control, or cut women off from Planned Parenthood\u2019s preventive health services,\u201d said Dawn Laguens the executive vice president of Planned Parenthood Action Fund in a statement. \u201cThis is simply a cynical political attempt to whitewash his terrible record and agenda for women\u2019s health. The reality is that Cory Gardner\u2019s proposal would actually cost women more by forcing them to pay out of pocket for the birth control that they are getting now at no cost thanks to the ACA.\u201d\n\nBut other Democrats see the GOP strategy as playing right into their hand, with Republicans implicitly acknowledging that women have reason to be skeptical of their agenda. As another Democratic operative put it, \u201cThe more time that we spend talking about birth control, we\u2019re winning.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Republicans may have found an answer to the Democratic \"War on Women\" battle cry in the most unexpected place: The women's health section of your local pharmacy.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "TIME.com", "description": "Republicans may have found an answer to the Democratic \"War on Women\" battle cry in the most unexpected place: The women's health section of your\u2026", "title": "Republicans Can't Stop Talking About Over-the-Counter Birth Control", "url": "http://time.com/3305879/republicans-cant-stop-talking-about-over-the-counter-birth-control/", "image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/ap190754811816.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/ap190754811816.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012"}, "description": "Republicans may have found an answer to the Democratic \"War on Women\" battle cry in the most unexpected place: The women's health section of your\u2026", "site": "TIME", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Republicans Can't Stop Talking About Over-the-Counter Birth Control"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-tooltip": "Current & Breaking News | National & World Updates", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://time.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/2cee445ea71a179ffd35ea91cf154905?s=16", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "fb": {"app_id": 53177223193}, "p": {"domain_verify": "f48a8936c3fffc943fce516f2e3ff1d2"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/time2014/img/time-touch_icon_152.png", "application-name": "TIME", "keywords": "2014 election, 2016 election, birth control, bobby jindal, contraception, cory gardner, democrats, kay hagan, planned parenthood, republicans, thom tillis", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/time", "author": "https://facebook.com/zekejmiller"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "birth control, republicans, planned parenthood, democrats, cory gardner, bobby jindal, thom tillis, contraception"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd7486\"", "article_summary": "As another Democratic operative put it, \u201cThe more time that we spend talking about birth control, we\u2019re winning.\u201d\nFour GOP Senate candidates have advocated for over-the-counter birth control, Colorado\u2019s Cory Gardner, Thom Tillis in North Carolina, Ed Gillespie in Virginia, and Mike McFadden in Minnesota.\nIf private plans didn\u2019t cover other forms of birth control, like IUDs, patients who use them would be forced to spend more out of pocket.\nNo birth control manufacturer has applied for an over-the-counter designation from the Food and Drug Administration, and only the contraceptive pill would be covered.\nJindal\u2019s political aides, and many GOP operatives, believe birth control is a gateway issue for women voters."}
