Pierce, NE

People from around the world have gathered in the small town of Pierce, Nebraska in the middle of a field just get to get a glimpse at history this weekend.

More than 450 classic Chevy's parked side by side, some covered in dirt, broken glass, and rust... but still worth a whole lot of money...

It all started with Ray Lambrecht, an auto dealer, who stored away new and used Chevrolet's. Now his daughter is auctioning off those cars that never sold. Many of the vehicles have fewer than 10 miles on the odometer.

So far today, a '58 Cameo with one mile went for $140,000 dollars, a '63 Chevy Impala went for $97,500, and a '57 Corvette pedal car went for $16,000. The auction will continue tomorrow.
