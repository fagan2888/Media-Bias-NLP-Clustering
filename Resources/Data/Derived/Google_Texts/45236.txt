A man who was arrested in Denver on Friday evening in connection with an Adams County triple homicide Wednesday is being held without bond.

Furmen Lee Leyba, 30, had been on the run for more than two days before he was taken into custody in northwest Denver. An Adams County sheriffâ€™s deputy was shot trying to apprehend Leyba.

The deputy, who has not been identified, was released from Denver Health Medical Center, a hospital official said Saturday.

Leyba is being held on suspicion of first-degree murder, attempted first-degree murder and a failure to appear in court warrant out of Adams County. He is due in court Monday, jail records show.

The arrest happened Friday within a large police perimeter that spanned from West 38th Avenue to 40th Avenue between Zuni and Clay streets.

Gabriel Flores, 41, also a suspect in the triple homicide, was arrested on Wednesday night after a high-speed chase with deputies in Jefferson County. Flores is being held without bond at the Adams County jail on a number of charges.

Flores and Leyba have been arrested previously almost two dozen times on charges including assault, robbery and weapons offenses.

Authorities in Adams County have not identified the three men killed in the shooting, which happened on Cragmore Street near Broadway.
