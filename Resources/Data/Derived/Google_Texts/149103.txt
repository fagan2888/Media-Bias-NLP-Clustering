As India continues to confront a brutal culture of rape, one comedy group has decided to take matters into its own hands and combat the all-too-common notion that women are to blame. All India Bakchod posted a sketch on YouTube called “It’s Your Fault” last Thursday that has already far surpassed its previous videos with nearly 1 million views.

In the video, an increasingly bruised and battered group of young women use the PSA format to cheerily correct the “notion that women are people too.” Because, “let’s face it ladies: Rape. It’s your fault.” From there, the women go through things women can do to “avoid” rape, from dressing more conservatively to staying in the kitchen.

All India Bakchod co-founder Gursimran Khamba spoke to Al Jazeera about the idea behind the video:

“The notion behind this video was pretty simple. We wanted to attack patriarchy as it exists in India. It sort of comes out every time there is a sexual assault case or a rape case. The first thing that happens, instead of focusing on the crime and looking at the perpetrator, the default for some reason is that the burden is always put on the woman.”

He added that it was intended to make viewers “uncomfortable” and has been “encouraged” by the response, including requests that the group put out a version in Hindi to reach even more people.
