Pete Sessions, R-Texas, wrote in an op-ed in the Dallas Morning News. \u201cThis hearing, one of a series of hearings investigating the flawed implementation of Obamacare, strives to get the answers that the American people deserve about Obamacare\u2019s navigator program.\u201d\n\nIssa and Sessions allege the program has three fundamental flaws: there is no screening to ensure convicted felons, particularly those involved in identify theft or fraud, aren\u2019t hired, and no rule barring them from the position even though it requires the possibility of handling personal information; the training is insufficient; and the program lacks proper federal oversight.\n\n\u201cProper consumer privacy protection guidelines should be a priority for this administration, particularly in a program like Obamacare that requires Americans to purchase insurance or pay a fine for noncompliance,\u201d they wrote.\n\nSebelius has her own op-ed in the same paper defending the program and charging that the hearing is designed to \u201cstifle, intimidate and impugn the reputation of people who have been working hard to help their fellow Texans get covered.\u201d\n\n\u201cMillions of Texans don\u2019t have the security of health coverage. In fact, Texas has the highest rate of uninsured in the nation. Yet there are some who will seemingly stop at nothing to deter Texans \u2014 and those who assist them \u2014 from obtaining coverage or even learning about their new options under the Affordable Care Act,\u201d Sebelius wrote. \u201cJust who are these people working to assist their fellow Texans? Those I\u2019ve met are dedicated, civic-minded Americans who have opened their hearts to their neighbors, because they want to help.\u201d\n\nShe says the navigators must complete at least 20 hours of training that includes privacy protection and security, pass a \u201crigorous exam,\u201d demonstrate they have no conflicts of interest, and participate in weekly training sessions. Issa and Sessions say that only five to 20 hours of training are required and calls the exam a \u201cquiz they can take as many times as needed.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "As House Oversight chairman Darrell Issa tours the country investigating Obamacare, embattled HHS director fights back", "og": {"url": "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/sebelius-issa-gop-impugning-obamacare-navigators/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/12/11/88a9f66d-d34d-4755-861c-0d7e88bdac17/thumbnail/1200x630/b8b00942f7cecadfc8905502d45f747f/kathleen_sebelius_AP887834417365.jpg", "height": 630}, "type": "article", "description": "As House Oversight chairman Darrell Issa tours the country investigating Obamacare, embattled HHS director fights back", "title": "Sebelius: Issa, GOP impugning Obamacare \u201cnavigators\u201d"}, "twitter": {"description": "As House Oversight chairman Darrell Issa tours the country investigating Obamacare, embattled HHS director fights back", "title": "Sebelius: Issa, GOP impugning Obamacare \u201cnavigators\u201d", "app": {"url": {"ipad": "cbsnewsapp://news/sebelius-issa-gop-impugning-obamacare-navigators/", "iphone": "cbsnewsapp://news/sebelius-issa-gop-impugning-obamacare-navigators/", "googleplay": "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/sebelius-issa-gop-impugning-obamacare-navigators/"}, "country": "US", "name": {"ipad": "CBS News", "iphone": "CBS News", "googleplay": "CBS News"}, "id": {"ipad": 334256223, "iphone": 334256223, "googleplay": "com.treemolabs.apps.cbsnews"}}, "site": "@CBSPolitics", "image": "http://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/12/11/88a9f66d-d34d-4755-861c-0d7e88bdac17/thumbnail/1200x630/b8b00942f7cecadfc8905502d45f747f/kathleen_sebelius_AP887834417365.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "al": {"web": {"url": "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/sebelius-issa-gop-impugning-obamacare-navigators/"}, "android": {"app_name": "CBS News", "package": "com.treemolabs.apps.cbsnews"}, "ios": {"url": "cbsnewsapp://news/sebelius-issa-gop-impugning-obamacare-navigators/", "app_name": "CBS News", "app_store_id": 334256223}}, "robots": "index, follow", "fb": {"app_id": 1536620209892267}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/CBSPolitics"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "Issa and Sessions say that only five to 20 hours of training are required and calls the exam a \u201cquiz they can take as many times as needed.\u201d\nHealth and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius and two Republican lawmakers exchanged a war of words ahead of a congressional hearing in Dallas Monday that will examine the Obamacare \u201cnavigators,\u201d employees who are trained to help Americans understand and select their new insurance options under the law.\n\u201cProper consumer privacy protection guidelines should be a priority for this administration, particularly in a program like Obamacare that requires Americans to purchase insurance or pay a fine for noncompliance,\u201d they wrote.\n\u201cJust who are these people working to assist their fellow Texans?\nIn fact, Texas has the highest rate of uninsured in the nation."}
