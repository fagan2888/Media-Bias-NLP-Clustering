Mark Herring stands at left, with Ralph Northam. (Bill O'Leary/Washington Post)\n\nLately in Virginia, it\u2019s good to be the attorney general.\n\nWhile Gov. Terry McAuliffe (D) has been hamstrung by a hostile, Republican-controlled General Assembly, Attorney General Mark R. Herring (D) has been pulling off feats of political \u00adderring-do \u2014 sometimes with just the stroke of a pen.\n\nHerring announced last week that he would take a pass on the 2017 governor\u2019s race and run for reelection instead, opting to aim for four more years in a job that allows for gutsy legal maneuvers rather than one saddled with legislative gridlock.\n\nHerring has witnessed the governor\u2019s frustrations, people close to the attorney general said, particularly as they searched jointly and fruitlessly last year for a way to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act after the proposal was rejected by the General Assembly.\n\n[McAuliffe, Herring explore end run around lawmakers]\n\nAt the same time, from his corner of Capitol Square, Herring was able to abruptly reverse the state\u2019s policies on gay marriage, in-state tuition for illegal immigrants and building standards for abortion clinics.\n\nThat is not to say that deep inside, Herring has no desire to see himself ensconced in Virginia\u2019s Executive Mansion someday. Or that his desire to stay put for now is not based on many factors, including a perception that the term-limited McAuliffe has been quietly rooting for a different successor, Lt. Gov. Ralph Northam (D).\n\nBut Herring\u2019s decision demonstrates the immense power of the attorney general\u2019s job, at least under his expansive interpretation of it. And it also reflects how much Richmond, like gridlocked Washington, has become a place where big change is more likely to come from swashbuckling legal or executive actions than from legislative give and take.\n\n\u201cThere really was a \u2018wow\u2019 factor to his first year in office,\u201d said Ellen Qualls, a Herring adviser. In Virginia, \u201cDemocrats haven\u2019t had the attorney general\u2019s office for 20 years, and I think we sort of forgot what you can do with it.\u201d\n\nHerring is sure to draw a GOP opponent in his quest for a second term. Del. Robert B. Bell (R-Albemarle), who ran in 2013 but lost in the primary, is considered a likely candidate.\n\nIn announcing that he would run for reelection, Herring also acknowledged the reality that what one attorney general can deliver, another can take away. \u201cOur hard-won progress is as fragile as the next election,\u201d he said.\n\nA. E. Dick Howard, a University of Virginia law professor and constitutional scholar, said partisan gridlock in Richmond means \u201cthe attorney general in some way is able to make more impact on the shape of Virginia law and policy than the governor. It makes perfect sense to me for an attorney general, who\u2019s able to run for reelection and who can act without the fetters of dealing with the other branch, to make that decision.\u201d\n\n[Clinton donors pumped millions into McAuliffe\u2019s coffers]\n\nEven so, much of Virginia\u2019s political class has been puzzled by Herring\u2019s move \u2014 former governor L. Douglas Wilder (D) called it decision \u201cshocking.\u201d\n\nDuring his 2013 campaign for attorney general, Herring pledged to take politics out of the office \u2014 a swipe at the aggressively conservative tenure of his immediate predecessor, Republican Ken Cuccinelli II (who ran for governor after one term but lost to McAuliffe).\n\nBut Herring\u2019s critics say he has since become the liberal flip side to Cuccinelli\u2019s activism, exceeding his authority and subverting the rule of law in pursuit of Democratic goals.\n\nHis reelection announcement drew instant pushback from conservatives, including Charlottesville-based talk radio host Joe Thomas, who tweeted that the attorney general wants to \u201ckeep on NOT enforcing #VA laws.\u201d\n\nHerring maintains that all of his actions have been \u201cfirmly grounded in the law,\u201d as he put it last week. He declared the state\u2019s ban on gay marriage unconstitutional before the Supreme Court legalized same-sex marriage nationwide but said he was building upon earlier high court rulings that signaled the justices were headed that way.\n\nHis decision on in-state tuition followed an Obama administration decree \u2014 hotly contested in its own right \u2014 to treat some illegal immigrants as if they were in the United States legally under certain conditions.\n\n[Herring backs Obama\u2019s immigration policy]\n\nPolitical observers had widely expected Herring to use his headline-generating record to launch a gubernatorial bid. The only declared candidate in the race so far is Northam, who announced in February. Given the lieutenant governor\u2019s relatively low profile, the attorney general was widely considered to have the advantage in a Democratic primary.\n\nBut Northam has something that Herring does not: a close relationship with McAuliffe. The lieutenant governor sits in on McAuliffe\u2019s weekly cabinet meetings, often serves as his surrogate and, with his wife, frequently socializes with the governor and first lady.\n\nHerring and McAuliffe, in contrast, do not have a strong personal rapport. Relations between their offices sometimes appear strained, with big announcements from one occasionally catching the other by surprise, according to legislators and staff who work with both.\n\nSpokesmen for McAuliffe\u2019s office and political action committee did not respond to requests for comment on the governor\u2019s relationship with the attorney general and his office. Herring spokesman Michael Kelly said there was no tension between the offices, noting that they have worked together on a daily basis.\n\nSome people close to Herring say McAuliffe\u2019s perceived preference for Northam was not a factor in his decision. But backing from the governor surely has the potential to provide an edge in the race, especially given McAuliffe\u2019s vast political network as a longtime fundraiser for both Bill and Hillary Rodham Clinton.\n\nQualls said Herring made his decision privately, on his own terms.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like we had a giant strategy summit and he decided at the end,\u201d she said. \u201cI literally think he was mowing his lawn one day and decided.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "With the governor saddled with a hostile legislature, the job of AG looks more appealing than ever.", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/laura.vozzella", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "With the governor saddled with a hostile legislature, the job of AG looks more appealing than ever.", "title": "In Virginia, Mark Herring decides it\u2019s just fine to be the attorney general", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/in-virginia-mark-herring-decides-its-just-fine-to-be-the-attorney-general/2015/09/05/faf5eaa2-526b-11e5-933e-7d06c647a395_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2015/09/06/Interactivity/Images/crop_freeVirginia_Governor_Herring-05fb5.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@LVozzella"}, "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "va politics, virginia politics, ppinclude, terry mcauliffe, clintons, doug wilder, ralph northam, mark herring, gay marriage, dreamers", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/laura.vozzella"}, "eomportal-uuid": "faf5eaa2-526b-11e5-933e-7d06c647a395", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "va politics, virginia politics, ppinclude, terry mcauliffe, clintons, doug wilder, ralph northam, mark herring, gay marriage, dreamers"}, "article_summary": "Given the lieutenant governor\u2019s relatively low profile, the attorney general was widely considered to have the advantage in a Democratic primary.\nTerry McAuliffe (D) has been hamstrung by a hostile, Republican-controlled General Assembly, Attorney General Mark R.
