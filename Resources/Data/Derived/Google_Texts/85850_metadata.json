What I want are tools that patients can use to empower themselves. Right now I'm the doctor. I have all the knowledge. I'm in control. I want to flip that dynamic. In the same way I am required by law to ask about allergies and medications, and talk about a past medical history, I want doctors to take the time to sit down, slow down and ask a patient: What's a good day for them? What's important for them? What are their values? What are their religious beliefs, their ritual beliefs? I want to know what their hopes and fears are for medical care, and where they want to spend the end of their life. I want to be required to have to ask that of all patients, at least to give them the opportunity. And sure, there may be some patients who are not ready to have that conversation, but I want them to know that I am open to having that conversation. It's the ultimate wellness pitch, I tell people: We are all going to die someday, and part of living well means addressing this life's final chapter. That's not about end of life. It's about a good life, for as long as you can, as best as you can.\"", "article_metadata": {"DivisionMain": "Division:AARP Bulletin Today", "Division1": "Division:AARP Bulletin Today", "page_title": "Top Doctors: How to Fix Health Care", "estimated_publish_date": "2016-02-16", "Last-Modified": "2016-02-16T10:46:14.285-05:00", "keywords": "health care, primary care, top doctors, sex differences, health care quality, american medicine, american  health care system, fix health care, choosing health care", "houseAds": "commercial", "paywallStatus": "off", "isArticle": "true", "author": "Elizabeth Agnvall", "comments": "on", "source": "aarp_bulletin_today", "type": "info", "description": "8 physicians tell us what one thing they would do to improve the American health care system", "IALevel3": "info-2015", "robots": "index,follow", "Subject1": "DCSubjects:Health/Health Insurance/Health care costs", "Subject2": "DCSubjects:Health/Healthy Living", "Subject3": "DCSubjects:Politics and Society/Advocacy", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "language": "english", "og": {"site_name": "AARP", "description": "8 physicians tell us what one thing they would do to improve the American health care system", "title": "Top Doctors on How to Improve the American Health Care System - AARP", "url": "http://www.aarp.org/health/healthy-living/info-2015/top-doctors-on-fixing-health-care.html", "image": "http://cdn.aarp.net/content/dam/aarp/health/healthy-living/2015-03/200-150-doctors-fix-healthcare-Peter.imgcache.rev1427985353315.jpg", "type": "article"}, "contentId": "/content/aarpe/en/home/health/healthy-living/info-2015/top-doctors-on-fixing-health-care", "fb": {"app_id": 114175878660191}, "aarpeContent": "true", "IALevel1": "health", "IALevel2": "healthy-living", "s43": "18b.HealthSolutions|MyHealth", "action": "read", "dateToday": "2016-05-25"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0318\"", "article_summary": "Empower patientsWe talk about patient-centered care, but we really have doctor-centered care.\nI want to know what their hopes and fears are for medical care, and where they want to spend the end of their life.\nI want to be required to have to ask that of all patients, at least to give them the opportunity.\nIt's about a good life, for as long as you can, as best as you can.\"\nWhat I want are tools that patients can use to empower themselves."}
