The program required monthly sessions in Indianapolis, but the rest was conducted online.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a modified or light version of an MBA,\u201d Voskanian, 42, said, in contrast to many MBA programs for physicians he had researched. \u201cI felt like I was getting a complete MBA in an academic setting from a good institution.\u201d\n\n\n\nBusiness schools around Indiana and the nation are having success attracting students to a growing number of specialized MBA programs, like the IU program for physicians.\n\n\n\nPurdue University\u2019s Krannert School of Management started a 12-month MBA program for professionals in the STEM (science, technology, engineering and math) fields. Also last year, the University of Indianapolis launched an MBA for school principals and superintendents. Now IU\u2019s Kelley School is developing a similar education MBA.\n\n\n\nIn 2011, Indiana Wesleyan University started an MBA for nurses working to receive their master\u2019s in nursing. And the University of Notre Dame has a joint MBA-JD program for attorneys.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis is the biggest trend right now,\u201d said Idie Kesner, dean of IU\u2019s Kelley School. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing some very, very innovative things going on.\u201d\n\n\n\nBusiness schools have been forced to get creative by a \u201cperfect storm\u201d of forces, Kesner said.\n\n\n\nThe Great Recession prompted many employers to stop tuition reimbursement for MBA programs.\n\n\n\nAt the same time, graduates of MBA programs no longer enjoyed the automatic bump in pay that usually came with the degree\u2014and was critical to paying off its high costs.\n\n\n\nThe forces pushed down the numbers of students taking the GMAT test\u2014required for entry by most MBA programs. Applications and enrollment also fell.\n\n\n\nFrom 2009 to 2013, the number of MBA students plunged nearly 40,000\u2014a 30-percent decline, according to the Virginia-based Graduate Management Admission Council.\n\n\n\nThat decline came after two decades in which the number of MBA programs proliferated around the country.\n\n\n\n\u201cIn any market where you have excess entry, there\u2019s going to be a shakeout period,\u201d said David Hummels, a Purdue economist who is interim dean of the Krannert school. Surviving in such an environment requires setting yourself apart from competitors, he added. \u201cOne way you can do this is, you can offer greater specialized programming.\u201d\n\n\n\nHummels noted that the situation has been exacerbated even further because top 10 MBA programs, such as the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Wharton School of Business, have ramped up enrollments, putting pressure on all schools ranked below them.\n\n\n\nPurdue\u2019s Krannert School, whose MBA program is ranked No. 21 by U.S. News & World Report, has responded by shrinking the number of MBA students it enrolls but expanding the number of other types of master\u2019s programs, in such fields as finance.\n\n\n\nThe number of Krannert students taking a full-time or weekend MBA has fallen nearly 20 percent since 2010, from 370 students to 298. But growth in Krannert\u2019s specialized master\u2019s programs, as well as its executive and STEM MBA, has pushed overall graduate enrollment at Krannert up 4 percent, to 654 students.\n\n\n\nSome schools, such as Wake Forest University in North Carolina, have shut down their traditional MBA programs entirely.\n\n\n\nThe Indianapolis operation of IU\u2019s Kelley School has seen its MBA students fall from 138 in the 2009-\u201910 school year to 122 in the 2014-\u201915 year. But the MBA for physicians has boosted the overall numbers, admitting 36 students last year.\n\n\n\nMass customization\n\n\n\nBeyond sheer numbers, changing demands from employers and students have also pushed MBA programs to specialize.\n\n\n\nEmployers that were still hiring MBA graduates increasingly demanded that those students be ready to work in that employers\u2019 industry from day one.\n\n\n\n\u201cIndustries are looking for people with particular expertise. Business schools aren\u2019t creating programs and looking for demand; demand is driving the programs,\u201d Robert Sullivan, chairman of the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business, told Fast Company magazine when IU launched its MBA program for physicians.\n\n\n\nOn top of that, working professionals in the prime age for earning an MBA\u2014age 25 to 40\u2014are used to having products and services tailored to their specific desires.\n\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the age group that has become quite accustomed to \u2018having it their way,\u2019\u201d said Kesner, referring to the ad slogan Burger King launched in the mid-1970s and revived several times. \u201cThey also want their education customized.\u201d\n\n\n\nSteve Tokar, director of the MBA program at the University of Indianapolis, said responding to that desire for customization is a matter of life and death now for business schools.\n\n\n\n\u201cUnless you can do mass customization, you\u2019re going to be out of business,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nFor years, he noted, UIndy has customized MBA programs for specific employers, such as Allison Transmission, Franciscan St. Francis Health and Sallie Mae.\n\n\n\nBut now, some industries are going through so much change in their business models that leaders in those fields are hungry for business skills tailored to their needs.\n\n\n\nIntense need\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s true in the medical field, especially, Kesner said, where the 2010 Affordable Care Act and unprecedented pressure from employers are transforming the way health care providers are evaluated, contracted and paid.\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s one reason, Kesner added, that physicians from California to Connecticut have signed up for IU\u2019s MD-MBA program.\n\n\n\n\u201cI realize now how much I miss working with other disciplines on systemic issues,\u201d Dr. Thomas Ciulla, an ophthalmologist and retinal surgeon at Indianapolis\u2019 Midwest Eye Institute, said in an email. \u201cIt has been a lot of work, but I have really enjoyed learning about business and the health care system. Medicine needs a voice during all of the change in health care and I now feel better equipped to be that voice.\u201d\n\n\n\nVoskanian, the Los Angeles physician, said the MBA program has helped him view major projects in his company\u2014such as adopting an electronic medical record system\u2014from perspectives beyond how it affects his work with patients.\n\n\n\n\u201cYou have a very different outlook on what needs to be done, what is going to be your return on investment, what is going to help the overall strategy,\u201d Voskanian said.\n\n\n\n\u201cPhysicians are in a great position once they learn the business skills, because they have clinical skills already,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are the best people to lead the health care system of the future.\u201d\u2022", "article_metadata": {"description": "Dr. Alen Voskanian had no intention of enrolling in a traditional MBA program even though the Los Angeles palliative-care physician was researching graduate programs to learn more management and financial skills.
