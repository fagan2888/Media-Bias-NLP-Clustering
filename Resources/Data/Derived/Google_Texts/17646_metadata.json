It\u2019s such a constant, such a fact of life, that it can feel a bit like complaining about traffic or the weather.\n\nBut just as there\u2019s a difference between waiting an extra 20 minutes during rush hour and being stranded in your car for five days \u2014 or between a typical snowstorm and what\u2019s happening currently in Buffalo \u2014 there\u2019s a difference between the routine hypocrisy of politics and the kind we saw this week from Republicans in the House. One kind is an annoyance to be quickly forgotten; the other leaves a mark.\n\nBefore getting into why they\u2019re so egregious, however, let\u2019s pause to recap the Congressional GOP\u2019s recent machinations.\n\nAware no doubt of how President Obama\u2019s announcement this week on immigration reform would dominate both the media and the public\u2019s attention, Republicans in the House, led by Rep. Paul Ryan, have been working to make sure the next head of the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) \u2014 which acts as Congress\u2019s honest broker when it comes to scoring fiscal policy \u2014 is not a nonpartisan technocrat, as has usually been the case, but rather a loyal member of the conservative movement. And, as former CBO chief Peter Orszag recently explained, because the CBO has no institutional protections from partisan hackery, and maintains its integrity mostly through tradition, there\u2019s precious little anyone can do to stop them.\n\nWhile there are no doubt many changes ideologues like Ryan would like to see the CBO make, reports indicate that the main reason GOPers want to install a right-wing hack as its chief is in order to make the agency integrate \u201cdynamic scoring\u201d more fully into its estimations. \u201cDynamic scoring,\u201d for those who don\u2019t know, is a phrase conservatives like to use to give a tenet of their anti-tax religion \u2014 lower taxes lead to more revenue! \u2014 an intellectual gloss. More importantly, dynamic scoring is generally the special sauce right-wing \u201cwonks\u201d put into their projections in order to claim that massively cutting taxes on the rich won\u2019t lead to fiscal ruin. Remember the absurd claim that Bush\u2019s tax cuts wouldn\u2019t explode deficits? Thank dynamic scoring for that.\n\nSo that\u2019s what\u2019s happening under the radar with the CBO. And if that were the whole story, it\u2019d probably fall under into the \u201croutine traffic and weather\u201d category of hypocrisy I mentioned earlier. What makes this more of a Buffalo snowstorm-level problem is the context \u2014 specifically, the fact that Republicans are destroying yet another norm of American politics, the nonpartisan CBO, at the very same time that they\u2019re waging a relentless and disingenuous campaign to persuade the media (and thus the American people) that the way the Affordable Care Act was written was a breach of democratic norms without precedent.", "article_metadata": {"description": "GOP's still banging the \"Grubergate\" drum -- but an under-the-radar push from Ryan shows they don't mean a word", "title": "Paul Ryan\u2019s stunning hypocrisy: The little-noticed way the GOP proved it\u2019s full of it", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "GOP's still banging the \"Grubergate\" drum -- but an under-the-radar push from Ryan shows they don't mean a word", "title": "Paul Ryan\u2019s stunning hypocrisy: The little-noticed way the GOP proved it\u2019s full of it", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/11/22/paul_ryans_stunning_hypocrisy_the_little_noticed_way_the_gop_proved_its_full_of_it/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/11/paul_ryan7.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "GOP's still banging the \"Grubergate\" drum -- but an under-the-radar push from Ryan shows they don't mean a word", "title": "Paul Ryan\u2019s stunning hypocrisy: The little-noticed way the GOP proved it\u2019s full of it", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/11/paul_ryan7.jpg", "creator": "@eliasisquith", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Elias Isquith", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Adam Serwer, CBO, Congressional Budget Office, dynamic scoring, Editor's Picks, Grubergate, Jonathan Gruber, MIT, Paul Ryan, peter orszag", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8ded\"", "article_summary": "\u201cDynamic scoring,\u201d for those who don\u2019t know, is a phrase conservatives like to use to give a tenet of their anti-tax religion \u2014 lower taxes lead to more revenue!\nThank dynamic scoring for that.\nMore importantly, dynamic scoring is generally the special sauce right-wing \u201cwonks\u201d put into their projections in order to claim that massively cutting taxes on the rich won\u2019t lead to fiscal ruin.\nTopics: Adam Serwer, CBO, Congressional Budget Office, dynamic scoring, Editor's Picks, Grubergate, Jonathan Gruber, MIT, Paul Ryan, peter orszag, Media News, News, Politics NewsAs a general rule, I try not to write about hypocrisy in politics.\nAnd if that were the whole story, it\u2019d probably fall under into the \u201croutine traffic and weather\u201d category of hypocrisy I mentioned earlier."}
