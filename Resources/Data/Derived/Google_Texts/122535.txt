A few observations on ArtPrize Seven’s Final 20: Only one entry, Whisper, appears on both the juried and public shortlists.

Last year, the only entry to appear on both shortlists was Intersections, which took home the grand prize in the public vote and shared the grand prize for the juried vote.

Additionally, Ann Loveless is the only past ArtPrize winner who is back this year on the Final 20 list. She teamed up with her husband, Steven, to create “Northwood Awakening,” which is on the Two-Dimensional list.

Round Two voting begins at 2 p.m. Sunday. Voters are allowed this year to vote on as many pieces in the Final 20 as they want.
