So as an RNC delegate, I chose to bind myself to the majority vote of Michigan. I remain neutral as chair, but I will be a Trump delegate in Cleveland,\u201d she said.\n\nShe did not, however, tell her uncle directly.\n\n\u201cI left that up to my dad to tell my uncle,\u201d she said. \u201cThat was not a phone call I wanted to make. I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019m out of the will at this point.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement \u2013 story continues below\n\nWatch the latest video at video.foxnews.com\n\nAs all political eyes look at Trump\u2019s path to the Republican convention in Cleveland, The Minneapolis Star-Tribune analyzed Trump\u2019s chances of locking up the nomination.\n\n\u201cTo all the political junkies yearning for a contested Republican convention this summer: not so fast,\u201d the paper reported. \u201cIt\u2019s still possible for Donald Trump to clinch the nomination by the end of the primaries on June 7. His path is narrow and perilous. But it\u2019s plausible and starts with a big victory Tuesday in his home state New York primary.\u201d\n\nBecause New York rules give a candidate who wins more than 50 percent of the vote in any congressional district all the delegates from that district, Trump could sweep well beyond a bare majority of delegates in his home state.\n\nThe paper then noted that on April 26, another 172 delegates are at stake in Pennsylvania, Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland and Rhode Island. Although the paper suggested Trump may have problems in Pennsylvania, he could offset that in Connecticut, Delaware and Maryland.\n\nAdvertisement \u2013 story continues below\n\nIn May, 199 delegates at stake in Indiana, Nebraska, West Virginia, Oregon and Washington. West Virginia and Indiana offer Trump the possibility for putting more deletes under his belt, the paper reported.\n\nThe primaries end June 7, with 303 delegates at stake in California, New Jersey, South Dakota, Montana and New Mexico. Trump\u2019s best chances are in California and in New Jersey, where \u2014 as Western Journalism reported \u2014 Gov. Chris Christie can rally his troops for Trump.\n\nh/t: Fox News", "article_metadata": {"description": "\"That was not a phone call I wanted to make.\"", "author": "Jack Davis", "og": {"site_name": "Western Journalism", "description": "\"That was not a phone call I wanted to make.\"", "title": "WATCH: Romney's Niece Just Made STUNNING Announcement About Trump That Mitt Won't Like", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 914, "identifier": "http://www.westernjournalism.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/romney-niece.jpg", "height": 551}, "updated_time": "2016-04-18T09:52:35-07:00", "url": "http://www.westernjournalism.com/watch-a-romney-republican-plans-to-back-trump-at-gop-convention/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "\"That was not a phone call I wanted to make.\"", "title": "WATCH: A Romney Republican Plans To Back Trump At GOP Convention", "image": "http://www.westernjournalism.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/romney-niece.jpg", "creator": "@WestJournalism", "site": "@WestJournalism", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "DC.date.issued": "2016-04-16T08:30:55-07:00", "fb": {"app_id": 275784739127435, "pages": 123624513983}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.westernjournalism.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/android-chrome-192x192.png", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/WesternJournalism", "section": "Election 2016", "tag": "Republican Convention", "published_time": "2016-04-16T08:30:55-07:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-18T09:52:35-07:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "romney niece, delegate, trump, michigan, republican convention, 2016 election, donald trump, mitt romney, politics, nation, religion"}, "article_summary": "Ronna Romney McDaniel, niece of former Republican presidential candidate and lead Trump-basher Mitt Romney, announced Friday that she has pledged to support Donald Trump at the Republican National Convention.\nAdvertisement - story continues belowOne member of the political Romney family makes it very clear that she understands the importance of following the will of the people.\n\u201cTo all the political junkies yearning for a contested Republican convention this summer: not so fast,\u201d the paper reported.\nAlthough the paper suggested Trump may have problems in Pennsylvania, he could offset that in Connecticut, Delaware and Maryland.\nThe primaries end June 7, with 303 delegates at stake in California, New Jersey, South Dakota, Montana and New Mexico."}
