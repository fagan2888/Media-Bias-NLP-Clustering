This year's third round of winter storm has dumped at least two inches of snow across central Oklahoma Thursday morning.

Wind Chill, Winter Weather Advisories

A wind chill advisory is in effect for 25 Oklahoma counties, including Oklahoma, Logan, Kingfisher counties and more, until 12 p.m. Thursday.

Meteorologists say wind chill values will remain between 0 and -15 through 12 p.m. Single digit wind chills are then expected Thursday afternoon.

Officials urge people to dress in layers and leave no skin exposed to the wind. Frostbite and hypothermia can happen quickly. Remember to check on the elderly and sick in your neighborhood to make sure they are staying warm.

A winter weather advisory remained in effect until 4 p.m. for 24 Oklahoma counties, including Oklahoma, Logan, McClain counties and more. Meteorologists say light snow will continue to fall Thursday morning and taper off west to east between 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.

Total snowfall amounts will range from one to three inches.

News 9 Chief Meteorologist David Payne says Oklahoma City received an average of two inches of snow on Thursday.



Officials say slick and hazardous travel will occur through the afternoon hours and could continue overnight. In addition, blowing snow could reduce visibilities near one mile at times, making driving even more difficult.

Drivers are urged to slow down and take precautions.

Road Condition

According to ODOT, crews in the panhandle and northwest continue to plow and treat areas that are snow packed. Drivers are encouraged to use caution and allow extra time traveling through the area.

Crews in the southwestern, central and northeastern parts of the state continue to treat highways and interstates as some slick spots remain. Conditions are steadily improving in many of these areas, which will greatly assist in these clearance operations.

During snow and/or ice conditions, motorists need to:

• Check road conditions before getting out on the roads.

• Be aware of "black ice," which looks wet on the roadway, but is actually a thin layer of ice.

During snow and/or ice conditions, motorists need to:

• Check road conditions before getting out on the roads.

• Be aware of "black ice," which looks wet on the roadway, but is actually a thin layer of ice.

• Stay at least 200 feet behind road-clearing equipment; crews need room to maneuver and can engage plowing or spreading materials without notice.

If drivers must travel out of state, they are urged to check area road conditions before heading out.
