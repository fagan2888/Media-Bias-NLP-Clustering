Credit: CJ Foeckler / Riverside Theater\n\nBy ,\n\nAlice Cooper once said, \"Rock 'n' roll ... ain't for kids.\" That's probably why the presence of children under 13 at a rock 'n' roll show is ordinarily as disturbing as the presence of children under 13 at a movie that earns its R rating.\n\nSaturday night at the Riverside Theater, however, the handful of kids at the sold-out My Morning Jacket show seemed not only welcome but also too few, because the quintet from Louisville, Ky., imbued its performance \u2014 one of two shows at the venue over the weekend \u2014 with positive, childlike qualities.\n\nDuring a set that stretched past two hours, the most useful quality was a loathing of boredom and sameness. With material from seven albums, each reflecting that loathing in its own way, the band kept itself and the audience from fidgeting.\n\nThe squirming variety could be epitomized in a single song like \"In Its Infancy (The Waterfall),\" which skipped from jittery, imploring refrains to jangly, lulling verses as if abrupt jumps were the only logical transitions.\n\nMore often, the band shifted smoothly, as when linking \"Only Memories Remain,\" which recalled Paul McCartney's pouting sweetness spiked with the tartness of the other three Beatles, to \"I Will Sing You Songs,\" which pushed into that Pink Floyd-ian realm where inner contemplation sounds like outer-space music.\n\nA child, or inner child, craving guidance through cosmos and imagination could scarcely have had a better conductor than My Morning Jacket frontman Jim James.\n\nLooking every inch \u2014 every frizzy follicle, every color splashed like bright paint onto his coat \u2014 the wicked genius who could also be a winning uncle, James held forth with a voice that frequently quavered as if coming from a much younger throat.\n\nThe sense of wonder James thus imparted to many songs remained one reason My Morning Jacket has been pegged as a Southern-rock Flaming Lips.\n\nFor bone-deep rock satisfaction on Saturday night, though, MMJ gave James the edge.\n\n\"Circuital\" cavorted with the chunky acoustic strumming of Peter Gabriel's \"Solsbury Hill,\" while Carl Broemel spun through the kind of guitar solos the Allman Brothers played during their lighter-than-air moments.\n\n\"One Big Holiday,\" with Tom Blankenship's Sabbath-cribbed bass line, and \"Touch Me I'm Going to Scream, Part 2,\" with its meld of Giorgio Moroder disco and Talking Heads funk (plus a sudden thrust toward Queen's ridiculous majesty), also demonstrated MMJ's willingness to bash out big dumb riffs and beats.\n\nRock 'n' roll can be for kids. It can also be for adults who, given capacity-crowd license by My Morning Jacket, want to daydream and scream as if they were kids again.", "article_metadata": {"title": "My Morning Jacket brings playful variety to Riverside show", "og": {"url": "http://www.jsonline.com/entertainment/musicandnightlife/my-morning-jacket-brings-playful-variety-to-riverside-show-b99519982z1-308841601.html", "image": {"width": 1024, "identifier": "http://media.jrn.com/images/b99519982z.1_20150621205550_000_g48bik2r.1-1.jpg", "height": 638}, "type": "article", "description": "The live band favorite kicked off a two-night Milwaukee residency with a sold-out show Saturday.", "title": "My Morning Jacket brings playful variety to Riverside show"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.jrn.com/images/b99519982z.1_20150621205550_000_g48bik2r.1-1.jpg", "description": "The live band favorite kicked off a two-night Milwaukee residency with a sold-out show Saturday.", "site": "@tapmilwaukee", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "My Morning Jacket brings playful variety to Riverside show"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "fb": {"admins": "journal.sentinel.1", "app_id": 227386193957280}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://media.jrn.com/designimages/logo-mjs-144-icon.png", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce619\"", "article_summary": "My Morning Jacket kicked off a two-night Riverside Theater residency with a sold-out show Saturday night.\nCredit: CJ Foeckler / Riverside TheaterBy ,Alice Cooper once said, \"Rock 'n' roll ... ain't for kids.\"\nIt can also be for adults who, given capacity-crowd license by My Morning Jacket, want to daydream and scream as if they were kids again.\nThe sense of wonder James thus imparted to many songs remained one reason My Morning Jacket has been pegged as a Southern-rock Flaming Lips.\nA child, or inner child, craving guidance through cosmos and imagination could scarcely have had a better conductor than My Morning Jacket frontman Jim James."}
