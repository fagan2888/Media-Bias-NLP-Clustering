It stops people from overdosing on opioids like heroin.\n\nIt\u2019s a first for Florida law enforcement agencies.\n\n\n\nThe naloxone auto-injector is like an epi-pen. Sarasota County Sheriff Tom Knight said he plans to have them in all patrol deputies\u2019 cruisers by November.\n\nSarasota and surrounding counties have seen a dramatic increase in opioid-related deaths since 2014.\n\nKnight said from July to September Sarasota, sheriff\u2019s deputies responded to 55 opioid overdose calls that resulted in five deaths.\n\n\u201cMost of the time EMS will beat us there, but it only takes one time to have it and use it and save somebody\u2019s life and we know we did the right thing by training 400-and-some people to use them,\" he said.\n\nThe company kal\u00e9o donated 800 doses worth of naloxone to the sheriff\u2019s office.\n\nKnight said he hopes the department won\u2019t run out of the drug. If it does, he said he\u2019ll look at options like working naloxone into their budget or applying for grants.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"category": "HNF Stories", "description": "Listen \n        Listening...", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://health.wusf.usf.edu/post/sarasota-sheriffs-office-first-law-enforcement-agency-florida-give-deputies-naloxone", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/shared/npr/styles/medium/nprshared/201510/447253562.JPG", "type": "article", "description": "Listen \n        Listening...", "title": "Sarasota Sheriff's Office First Law Enforcement Agency In Florida To Give Deputies Naloxone"}, "story_id": 447243392, "twitter": {"site": "@HealthNewsFL", "card": "summary", "creator": "@HealthNewsFL"}, "author": "Topher Forhecz", "org_id": 399, "dc": {"title": "Sarasota Sheriff&#039;s Office First Law Enforcement Agency In Florida To Give Deputies Naloxone"}, "nid": 12276, "datePublished": "2015-10-11", "keywords": "Nalaxone", "wordCount": 325, "has_audio": 1, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "Knight said from July to September Sarasota, sheriff\u2019s deputies responded to 55 opioid overdose calls that resulted in five deaths.\nThe Sarasota County Sheriff\u2019s Office announced Friday it will equip its deputies with a drug called naloxone.\nIf it does, he said he\u2019ll look at options like working naloxone into their budget or applying for grants.\nSarasota County Sheriff Tom Knight said he plans to have them in all patrol deputies\u2019 cruisers by November.\nThe company kal\u00e9o donated 800 doses worth of naloxone to the sheriff\u2019s office."}
