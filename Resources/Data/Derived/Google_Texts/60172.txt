If you want empty rhetoric and business as usual, there are many Republicans to choose from. But I believe it's time we burn the corrupt Washington political machine to the ground and rebuild America before it's too late!

Some Republican presidential candidates want to abolish Medicare, slash Social Security and tell American seniors to "get over it" when it comes to cutting their benefits. They want to rob seniors of their benefits and give them a worthless healthcare voucher instead. Let me be clear: raising the retirement age and slashing Medicare benefits for seniors who have been working for decades is theft! We have enough muggers in the streets without the government becoming one!
