That means your birth control \u2014 whether it's the pill or the IUD or the patch or the ring or the implant or a sterilization \u2014 should be free.

DeFrancesco, M.D., president of the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, said in a statement. \"It helps to avoid unintended pregnancy and also allows patients to control existing conditions before becoming pregnant, which means healthier pregnancies. Moreover, birth control can have important medical benefits outside of contraception.\"\n\nFollow Jill on Twitter.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.contenttype": "article", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/20/160x160/square-1431368009-149321478-1.jpg", "description": "No matter what method you're using, it should be free.", "title": "The Obama Admininstration Clarifies: Yes, Your Insurer Must Cover Your Birth Control", "og": {"site_name": "Cosmopolitan", "description": "No matter what method you're using, it should be free.", "title": "The Obama Administration Clarifies: Yes, Your Insurer Must Cover Your Birth Control", "url": "http://www.cosmopolitan.com/health-fitness/news/a40324/affordable-care-act-birth-control/", "image": {"url": "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/20/1600x800/landscape-1431368009-149321478-1.jpg", "width": 1600, "identifier": "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/20/1600x800/landscape-1431368009-149321478-1.jpg", "height": 800}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@Cosmopolitan", "image": {"src": "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/20/1431368009-149321478-1.jpg"}, "description": "No matter what method you're using, it should be free.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "The Obama Administration Clarifies: Yes, Your Insurer Must Cover Your Birth Control"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-05-11T14:22:00-04:00", "sailthru.socialtitle": "The Obama Administration Clarifies: Yes, Your Insurer Must Cover Your Birth Control", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=951817550, affiliate-data=pt=305920&ct=OnSiteCosmo&mt=8", "fb": {"app_id": 162305873819997, "pages": 8358247707}, "auto-publish": "evergreen", "sailthru.tags": "Health & Fitness", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Cosmopolitan", "section": "Health & Fitness", "published_time": "2015-05-11 06:22:00", "modified_time": "2015-05-11 22:05:47"}, "sailthru.image.full": "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/20/768x384/landscape-1431368009-149321478-1.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf2e3\"", "article_summary": "Moreover, birth control can have important medical benefits outside of contraception.\"\nThat means your birth control \u2014 whether it's the pill or the IUD or the patch or the ring or the implant or a sterilization \u2014 should be free.\n\"It is now absolutely clear that all means all \u2014 all unique birth control methods for women must be covered.\nThe Affordable Care Act (ACA) requires that insurance companies cover all FDA-approved contraceptive methods without a co-pay or deductible, the Obama administration clarified today.\nUnder the Affordable Care Act, women are no longer supposed to be at the mercy of insurance companies."}
