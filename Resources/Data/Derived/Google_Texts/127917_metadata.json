Rob Bishop and Jason Chaffetz, both R-Utah, last week introduced the long-anticipated bill after spending more than three years meeting with stakeholders ranging from ranchers to conservation groups.\n\nThe federal government owns one out of every two acres in the West, enveloping more land there than any other region.\n\nThe Public Lands Initiative would reallocate 1.05 million acres to private and state control for new recreation and economic development opportunities. To ensure environmental protection, the plan would create 40 additional wilderness areas in Utah, covering more than 2.2 million acres.\n\nBishop, chairman of the House Natural Resources Committee, calls the measure \u201cThe Grand Bargain\u201d and says Utah\u2019s future relies on a balance of \u201cconservation and development.\u201d\n\n\u201cMuch of the debate has centered on the idea that multiple-use [development] and land conservation is an either or proposition,\u201d Bishop wrote in an op-ed. \u201cI flatly reject this notion. Conservation and multiple-use can coexist.\u201d\n\nIn a prepared statement, the Utah Republican said the legislation would spur economic development to increase funding for schools and create jobs. His office said the initiative would resolve unsettled land disputes among competing groups over legal use or ownership.\n\nHis co-sponsor, Chaffetz, is chairman of the Government Reform and Oversight Committee.\n\nSen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, intends to sponsor companion legislation in the Senate. In a prepared statement, Lee said:\n\nNot only does this bill secure valuable land for natural resource development to fund public schools; not only does it promote conservation and recreation; but it also protects those with existing interests on federal lands and will insulate the participating counties from future disruptive federal action.\n\nBut conservation groups and native tribes remain skeptical.\n\n\u201cThe draft \u2026 is an un-wilderness bill,\u201d Scott Groene, executive director of the Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance, said. \u201cEffectively, less wilderness would be protected in Utah if this bill passed than what is currently managed for the public.\u201d\n\nNick Loris, an economist at The Heritage Foundation, lauded the initiative for shifting responsibility and ownership of land to the state, arguing there is \u201cno compelling reason\u201d for the federal government to own as much land as it does.\n\n\u201cPutting Washington in charge of the West has resulted in lost economic opportunity, has taken decisions away from local citizens and in many instances resulted in environmental degradation because of federal government\u2019s land mismanagement,\u201d Loris told The Daily Signal.\n\nThe transfer of ownership would give local governments and the state improved land use along with greater environmental protection, he said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Reps.
