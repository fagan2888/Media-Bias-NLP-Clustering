Rather than willingly giving Obamacare a newly bipartisan sheen, they publicly committed to repealing it in full. (The only exception to this partial-repeal moratorium was supposed to be in cases, like with Obamacare\u2019s individual mandate or insurer bailout, where partial repeal would weaken Obamacare and thus advance the cause of repeal.)\n\nThe party\u2019s focus on repealing and replacing Obamacare has clearly served it well while reflecting public sentiment. Since Obamacare\u2019s passage, Republican membership has increased by more than 30 percent in the Senate and nearly 40 percent in the House. These are massive, historic, Obamacare-driven gains.\n\nBut what happens when Republicans\u2019 desire to repeal and replace Obamacare collides with their desire to provide relief to a particular deep-pocketed corporate interest? You guessed it: the latter wins \u2014 in a landslide. On Thursday, the House passed legislation to repeal Obamacare\u2019s medical device tax, 280-140. Among Republicans, the vote was 234-0.\n\nThis result can hardly be attributed to Republican members\u2019 phones ringing off the hook with calls from everyday constituents who simply loathe the medical device tax. In truth, the tax is a part of Obamacare that most Americans have likely never even heard of. But the medical-device-tax lobby is willing to throw around a lot of money \u2014 which, of course, is all the more reason to make sure that this money gets channeled toward the cause of full repeal.\n\nThe bill in question now moves to the Senate, where one hopes Republicans will prioritize the cause of repeal over the desires of a particular GOP-friendly (for now) industry.\n\nWriting at The Hill, Heather Higgins and Hadley Heath Manning of Independent Women\u2019s Voice lay out the issue well, arguing that Republicans should suspend the tax, not repeal it:\n\n\u201cThis year, the priority should be to pass a moratorium on the medical device tax that would last until 2017\u2026.A moratorium would spare the medical device industry from immediate and near-term financial harm, while preserving the important policy principle that no special interest should jump ahead in line and be permanently out from under ObamaCare while the law exists.\u201d\n\nThey write that repealing, rather than suspending, the tax invites \u201cthree self-inflicted wounds\u201d:\n\n\u201cFirst, doing so impairs the likelihood of repealing and replacing ObamaCare come 2017. Repeal/replace has no deep-pocketed industry allies outside of the medical device industry\u2026.\n\n\u201cSecond, Republicans will create a terrible precedent for providing special relief to individual corporate interests\u2026.\n\n\u201cThird, attending to these corporate interests will send precisely the wrong message to Americans about the seriousness of the GOP about achieving repeal, or about caring about people like them.\u201d\n\nHiggins and Manning conclude that Republicans should embrace \u201ca strategy that not only works in the short-term to help just one important constituency, but which helps them without undermining the long-term cause of undoing the most damaging law in history for all Americans.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s one final thought: If King v. Burwell goes against the Obama administration, don\u2019t be surprised if congressional Republicans look to made a deal with President Obama \u2014 offering to turn Obamacare\u2019s taxpayer-financed, abortion-funding subsidies back on in exchange for (you guessed it) Obama\u2019s willingness to repeal the medical device tax.\n\nJeffrey H.
