(Photo: Associated Press)\n\nRepublicans have several favorite sins. One such sin is beating an issue to death. An example of classic proportion is Obamacare. About 16 million people now have health care. Why spend years trying to repeal an action that has helped so many people and been upheld by the Supreme Court?\n\nLately, Republicans state scientists are in error when they claim humans don\u2019t cause global warming. Their excuse for believing this is very pathetic: How do we know, we\u2019re not scientists? Thank God they are not.\n\nMaybe the biggest sin is creating problems that don\u2019t exist, namely making it harder to vote because of a nonexistent problem called voter fraud. Creating laws that block voters is undemocratic. Voter suppression is wrong any way you cast it.\n\nLastly, there is the sin of choosing to be negative on just about any topic. I think they relish dirty laundry of any type. Some items that need washing in their view are: income tax, Social Security, Medicare, fill-in-the-blank. Listen closely to them; what are the positive solutions or the common ground compromises they support? You could go deaf waiting for them.\n\nSolutions: fight black-and-white thinking because it belongs in the past, just like black and white TV; embrace compromise \u2014 it\u2019s the essence of democracy; cut the demonizing of those you disagree with; and find positive ways to encourage the vote, not sitting by your remote.\n\nDid Oscar Wilde get it right: There is no sin but stupidity?\n\n\u2014 Ron Phillips, Bettendorf\n\nRead or Share this story: http://dmreg.co/1TDg32h", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "One such sin is beating an issue to death; maybe the biggest sin is creating problems that don\u2019t exist", "p": {"domain_verify": "372c291dc2b106308d26264f4fba3b10"}, "og": {"site_name": "Des Moines Register", "description": "One such sin is beating an issue to death; maybe the biggest sin is creating problems that don\u2019t exist", "title": "The four favorite sins of Republicans", "url": "http://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/opinion/readers/2016/05/25/four-favorite-sins-republicans/84613122/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/desmoinesregister.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "One such sin is beating an issue to death; maybe the biggest sin is creating problems that don\u2019t exist", "title": "The four favorite sins of Republicans", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/45b612f0e9112094d195866a8a402da783cce3b0/c=99-0-470-371&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2016/02/01/IAGroup/DesMoines/635899675641721663-GOP-2016-Trump-Rips-15-.jpg", "creator": "@DMRegister", "site": "@DMRegister", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600025120", "fb": {"app_id": 169766623060429}, "viewport": "width=1070", "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Organizations/Republican Party", "gci-asset-type": "story", "gci-categories": "Organizations/Republican Party", "title": "The four favorite sins of Republicans", "author": "Ron Phillips, Bettendorf", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "opinion/readers", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9aeeebf4723b4f63dd7b855caa04c7d235572eee/c=117-0-395-371/local/-/media/2016/02/01/IAGroup/DesMoines/635899675641721663-GOP-2016-Trump-Rips-15-.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/a5e51fa934c4cefa95bc9992cb2e08db48c57038/c=99-0-470-371/local/-/media/2016/02/01/IAGroup/DesMoines/635899675641721663-GOP-2016-Trump-Rips-15-.jpg", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/8a4eb53ea5d1422f546e8623b5a304371d8da392/c=9-0-502-371/local/-/media/2016/02/01/IAGroup/DesMoines/635899675641721663-GOP-2016-Trump-Rips-15-.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/8ffa4faacab3c2c58faee3d7929caf9b81f74a07/c=0-15-511-304&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/2016/02/01/IAGroup/DesMoines/635899675641721663-GOP-2016-Trump-Rips-15-.jpg", "publishtime": "2016-05-25T00:00:37.910000-05:00", "shorthed": "The favorite sins of Republicans", "articleid": 84613122, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/a419ad65bc1401975d9db66bf475fcf6e1eeb1e4/c=0-15-511-304/local/-/media/2016/02/01/IAGroup/DesMoines/635899675641721663-GOP-2016-Trump-Rips-15-.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/ce2942e6dd0b78feac7d491e26fdcb504412bf3e/c=152-0-360-371/local/-/media/2016/02/01/IAGroup/DesMoines/635899675641721663-GOP-2016-Trump-Rips-15-.jpg"}}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe186d\"", "article_summary": "(Photo: Associated Press)Republicans have several favorite sins.\nLately, Republicans state scientists are in error when they claim humans don\u2019t cause global warming.\nMaybe the biggest sin is creating problems that don\u2019t exist, namely making it harder to vote because of a nonexistent problem called voter fraud.\nWhy spend years trying to repeal an action that has helped so many people and been upheld by the Supreme Court?\nDid Oscar Wilde get it right: There is no sin but stupidity?"}
