Iohannis, who was surrounded by security staff, was booed by demonstrators who shouted \"Resign!\" He spoke to a few protesters and left after less than half an hour. Iohannis has called on Romania's civil society to take part in consultations for a new government.\n\nPrime Minister Victor Ponta and his Cabinet resigned Wednesday after mass protests, which have continued this week.\n\nEnache's death was the fourth reported on Sunday. Nitescu earlier reported that a man had succumbed to his injuries at the state burns hospital late Saturday.\n\nMediafax news agency reported two other patients died early Sunday at the Floreasca Emergency Hospital, including a Turkish man studying in Romania, and a woman who worked at the club's bar.\n\nNine deaths were announced Saturday, the highest number for a single day.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Drummer in band playing when Romanian nightclub fire broke out dies, bringing death toll to 45", "author": "Associated Press", "og": {"site_name": "Daily Herald", "description": "Drummer in band playing when Romanian nightclub fire broke out dies, bringing death toll to 45", "title": "Drummer dies to bring Romanian club fire death toll to 45", "url": "http://www.dailyherald.com/article/20151108/news/311089917/", "image": "http://www.dailyherald.com/storyimage/DA/20151108/news/311089917/EP/1/1/EP-311089917.jpg&updated=201511081330&imageversion=Facebook&exactH=630&exactW=1200&exactfit=crop&noborder", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Drummer in band playing when Romanian nightclub fire broke out dies, bringing death toll to 45", "title": "Drummer dies to bring Romanian club fire death toll to 45", "url": "http://www.dailyherald.com/article/20151108/news/311089917/", "image": "http://www.dailyherald.com/storyimage/DA/20151108/news/311089917/AR/0/AR-311089917.jpg&updated=201511081330&maxw=1200&maxh=1200", "site": "@dailyherald", "card": "summary", "account_id": 8960722}, "robots": "noarchive", "fb": {"app_id": 105603449548761}, "keywords": "News, Nation/World, Associated Press", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/DailyHeraldFans", "published_time": "2015-11-08", "modified_time": "2015-11-08T17:30:00Z"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe10c5\"", "article_summary": "Associated PressBUCHAREST, Romania -- The drummer of a heavy metal band playing when a fire broke out at a nightclub has died, bringing the death toll from last week's tragedy to 45.\nDozens of people injured in the blaze remain hospitalized with serious burns as authorities warn that the death toll could continue to rise.\nA fire broke out at the Colectiv nightclub during a concert by the heavy metal group, after a spark from a pyrotechnics show ignited foam decor.\nNitescu earlier reported that a man had succumbed to his injuries at the state burns hospital late Saturday.\nDrummer dies to bring Romanian club fire death toll to 45helloPeople raise their hands shouting slogans against politicians during the fifth day of protests in Bucharest, Romania, Saturday, Nov. 7, 2015, calling for better governance and an end to corruption, in Bucharest, Romania, Nine more people died Saturday, bringing the death toll to 41 victims, a week after the Oct. 30 blaze that erupted at the Colectiv nightclub during a heavy-metal concert."}
