Critics relying largely on one or two data points have tended to prematurely declare young people staunch economic liberals (e.g. here, here, here, and here). However, millennial attitudes are just not that simple; in particular they are not economic leftists as some have claimed.\n\nInstead, Reason-Rupe's latest study of the millennial cohort shows they are socially liberal, are averse to many nanny state regulations, and are fiscal centrists.\n\nAs I wrote in our July report:\n\n\"Findings from the Reason-Rupe 2014 Millennial Survey of young Americans 18-29 reveal this cohort flouts traditional political allegiances: They trust neither political party, are social liberals and fiscal centrists, and are supportive of both business and government. They favor free markets, but aren\u2019t sure whether markets or government best drive income mobility. In all, millennials are neither a Democratic nor a Republican generation; they remain politically unclaimed.\"\n\nWhat makes this generation particularly notable is that they don\u2019t conform to conventional political stereotypes. In particular, their increased social liberalism has not gone in lockstep with economic liberalism.\n\nTo this point, Thomas Edsall in the New York Times citing a recent Pew survey observes the \"emergence of a cohort of younger voters who are loyal to the Democratic Party, but much less focused on economic redistribution than on issues of personal and sexual autonomy.\" Edsall cites an email exchange with Andrew Kohut of the Pew Research Center, in which Kohut further explains, \"There is a libertarian streak that is apparent among these left-of-center young people. Socially liberal but very wary of government.\"\n\nLooking at the millennial cohort broadly, as I will detail below, we find millennials are similar to older cohorts across a number of economic issues, are favorable toward business and profit, and are growing increasingly concerned about government efficacy. Pew finds millennials are more likely to favor more services with a larger government than fewer services with a smaller government. However once tax rates are taken into consideration support flips and millennials prefer smaller government. Perhaps an issue of old Cold War semantics, millennials appear less likely to associate the \"size\" of government with costs.\n\n1. Business and the Safety Net The Pew Research Center finds that even though millennials are much more socially liberal, \"[Millennial] views are not particularly distinctive in other areas, such as attitudes about business and the social safety net\" (p. 63).\n\nBusiness and Regulation\n\nThe charts on the right show that millennials are similar to older cohorts on Pew\u2019s Business Attitudes Index. Pew also found that millennials are actually more likely than older cohorts to agree \"corporations generally strike a fair balance between making profits and serving the public interest,\" compared to older cohorts.\n\nMoreover, aggregating polls from Pew, National Journal, and the Public Affairs Council shows that young people are about equally likely as older people to say \"government regulation of business is necessary to protect the public interest.\" (See chart).\n\nIf millennials had veered hard left economically we would have observed them becoming less friendly to business and more supportive of regulation, compared to older cohorts, yet we have not. Instead Reason-Rupe finds millennials have favorable views of business, profit, competition and entrepreneurship. In addition, two-thirds perceive government regulators to place special interests above the public\u2019s.\n\nSafety Net\n\nWhen it comes to the social safety net, millennials support it. But Pew finds little evidence that millennials are more supportive than older cohorts: writing that millennials are \"not particularly supportive of an expanded social safety net\" (p.76). Indeed, the chart (right) shows similar shares of millennials, GenXers, and Boomers agree \"government should help more needy people even if it means going deeper into debt.\"", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "Millennials' increased social liberalism has not gone in lockstep with hostility to free markets, and they oppose big government when costs are considered.", "title": "Are Millennials Far Left on Economics?
