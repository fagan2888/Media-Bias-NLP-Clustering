However, state exemptions for personal goods and residences meant that such \u201cestate recovery\u201d efforts were modest as most people either had no other assets or had \u201cspent down\u201d those that they had to a minimal level.\n\nBut with the expansion under ObamaCare, more and more people will qualify for Medicaid without realizing that the coverage is really not free, but instead a hidden secured loan whose terms aren't explicit. As Carol Ostrom, the Seattle Times health reporter, explained:\n\nThe way Prins saw it, that meant health insurance via Medicaid is hardly \u201cfree\u201d for Washington residents 55 or older. It\u2019s a loan, one whose payback requirements aren't well advertised. And it penalizes people who, despite having a low income, have managed to keep a home or some savings they hope to pass to heirs, Prins said.\n\nSofia and Gary lived together, she as an artist and he as a tango instructor, and when they saw that they would see their assets evaporate under estate recovery rules if they signed up for Medicaid, they decided to get married. That way, their combined incomes qualified them for ObamaCare coverage on the state exchange, helped along with some federal subsidies. Said Sofia:\n\nWe\u2019re happy to be getting married. Unfortunately not everyone has such an elegant solution to the problem.\n\nNo, they don\u2019t. Barry Blake lived with his mother who owned her own home and was covered under Medicaid. When she died, the state of Kentucky \u201ctook the house ... to be sold and pay those expenses\u201d according to a suit Blake filed to recover it in 2009. The state also took the washer and dryer, their lawn mower, gardening tools, kitchen appliances and other personal items. Blake hadn't read the fine print. The lawsuit was dismissed.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s John and Mary, clients of Jeffrey Marshall, an elder law attorney practicing in Pennsylvania. Wrote Marshall:\n\nWhen John came back from Korea he took over working the family farm. Eventually, John and his wife Mary inherited the farm from John\u2019s parents. John and Mary were always \u201cdirt poor.\u201d\n\nIn 2000 Mary\u2019s health began to decline due to Parkinson\u2019s disease and dementia. Everyone in the family pitched in to care for Mary and keep her home. In 2003, after 3 years of struggle, the family needed some outside help. They applied for home care that was paid for in part by Medicaid. This extra help, combined with the ongoing care by John and the boys and their wives, allowed Mary to stay at home for another full year.\n\nIn 2006 John died of a heart attack. Without John's support in caring for Mary, the family was no longer able to care for Mary at home. She moved to a local nursing facility. The family didn't have the cash to fully afford the nearly $8,000 a month cost and Medicaid benefits were needed.\n\nMary died in January 2009. She was 84. Three weeks later her sons received a letter in the mail from the Government. The letter said Pennsylvania was owed $171,386 for the Medicaid that was provided for Mary\u2019s care, both at home and in the nursing facility.\n\nThe boys are going to have to find some way to pay off this state lien. But they don't have this kind of money. Most likely, the farm will have to be sold.\n\nThere are an estimated 15 million people who are expected to sign up for Medicaid under the new rules which are very explicit:\n\nStates must pursue recovering costs for medical assistance consisting of nursing home or other long-term institutional services, home- and community-based services, hospital and prescription drug services ... and any other items covered by the Medicaid State Plan.\n\nAt a minimum, states must recover from assets that pass through probate ... at a maximum, states may recover any assets of the deceased recipient.\n\nPaul Craig Roberts, who served under President Ronald Reagan as his assistant Secretary of the Treasury, forwarded an article written by \u201ca knowledgeable person who wishes to remain anonymous\u201d entitled \u201cObamacare: A Deception\u201d earlier this year which stated clearly:\n\nYour estate is what you own when you die \u2014 your home and what\u2019s in it, other real estate you may own, your bank account, annuities and so on.\n\n[Under estate recovery] even if you have a will, your heirs are chopped liver.\n\nLow-income people often have only one major asset \u2014 the home in which they live and, in some cases, this has been the family home through several generations.\n\nWhat this boils down to is this: if you are put into Medicaid \u2014 congratulations! \u2014 you just got a mandated collateral loan if you use Medicaid benefits.\n\nWhen Republican Party candidate for president Herman Cain broached the subject of \u201cestate recovery\u201d on his radio show, he got so many responses that he decided to put his comments into writing:\n\nThe problem here is that the ACA is taking away insurance plans that people could afford and simultaneously offering replacements that are more expensive. At the same time, it\u2019s expanding the definition of \u201clow income\u201d by removing asset tests.\n\nIf you can\u2019t afford the new, high price ... you are forced into Medicaid since, because of the individual mandate, you MUST be covered.\n\nSo, the feds have created a situation where you can lose the coverage you could afford, can\u2019t afford the replacement plans, and are forced into Medicaid which will allow the state to come after your assets when you die.\n\nWith the expanded definitions under Medicare, millions are going to be invited into the trap of free Medicaid coverage instead of the expensive exchange coverages only to find that they, and their heirs, will be forced to learn once again the rule about \u201cfree\u201d: There's no such thing as a free lunch.\n\nA graduate of Cornell University and a former investment advisor, Bob is a regular contributor to The New American magazine and blogs frequently at www.LightFromTheRight.com, primarily on economics and politics.
