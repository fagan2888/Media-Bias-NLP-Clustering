State officials say the new exchange will be up and running by November 15, when the next open enrollment period begins.

Those who purchased exchange insurance this year will have to reapply all over again during the next open enrollment period if they want to keep their access to federal premium subsidies.\n\nCustomers who purchased their coverage without subsidies and continue to pay their bills won\u2019t be required to sign up again, but the vast majority of Obamacare exchange sign-ups who do qualify for federal premium tax credits will have to navigate their way through Maryland\u2019s second attempt at an Obamacare website.\n\nMaryland\u2019s not alone. Oregon also gave up on its Obamacare exchange, but instead of attempting to start over themselves, the state handed the Obama administration control of the state marketplace. Because the two systems aren\u2019t reconcilable, all 80,000 of Oregon\u2019s Obamacare customers will have to sign up for coverage again at HealthCare.gov for 2015.

The Obama administration announced earlier this summer that those who aren\u2019t changing their policies or personal information for subsidy qualification will be given options for automatic re-enrollment.\n\nConvincing existing customers to go through the process of applying to the Obamacare exchange could be difficult given Maryland\u2019s less than stellar first year of the health care law. The exchange\u2019s website crashed on the first day of Obamacare\u2019s open enrollment period last falls and officials were unable to make it fully operable.\n\nFollow Sarah on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Sarah Hurtubise", "description": "Maryland's failed first try at its Obamacare exchange will force most of its 72,000 sign-ups to completely re-enroll in coverage for 2015.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "Maryland's failed first try at its Obamacare exchange will force most of its 72,000 sign-ups to completely re-enroll in coverage for 2015.\u00a0    After struggling for six months to fix an inoperable exc", "title": "Maryland Obamacare Exchange Flop Will Force Thousands To Re-enroll", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2014/07/18/maryland-obamacare-exchange-flop-will-force-thousands-to-re-enroll/", "image": {"width": 1185, "identifier": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/RTR3IXIX-1-630x4441-e1453761615395.jpg", "height": 552}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Can't use info from defective system", "creator": "@@SarahMHurtubise", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2014/07/18/maryland-obamacare-exchange-flop-will-force-thousands-to-re-enroll/", "image": {"src": "http://dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/RTR3IXIX-1-630x4441-e1453761615395.jpg"}, "title": "Maryland Obamacare Exchange Flop Will Force Thousands To Re-enroll Via @dailycaller", "site": {"identifier": "@dailycaller", "id": 39308549}, "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-07-18 19:36:40", "sailthru.title": "Maryland Obamacare Exchange Flop Will Force Thousands To Re-enroll", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "keywords": "maryland,obamacare", "fb": {"app_id": 143489452702, "pages": 182919686769}, "sailthru.tags": "maryland,obamacare,sarah-hurtubise", "sailthru.description": "Maryland's failed first try at its Obamacare exchange will force most of its 72,000 sign-ups to completely re-enroll in coverage for 2015.\u00a0    After struggling for six months to fix an inoperable exc", "sailthru.image.full": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/RTR3IXIX-1-630x4441-e1453761615395.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "4260498Maryland\u2019s failed first try at its Obamacare exchange will force most of its 72,000 sign-ups to completely re-enroll in coverage for 2015.\nState officials say the new exchange will be up and running by November 15, when the next open enrollment period begins.\nAfter struggling for six months to fix an inoperable exchange website, Maryland gave up entirely on its first attempt and opted to start over with technology the state purchased from Connecticut\u2019s state-run exchange instead.\nBecause the two systems aren\u2019t reconcilable, all 80,000 of Oregon\u2019s Obamacare customers will have to sign up for coverage again at HealthCare.gov for 2015.\nOregon also gave up on its Obamacare exchange, but instead of attempting to start over themselves, the state handed the Obama administration control of the state marketplace."}
