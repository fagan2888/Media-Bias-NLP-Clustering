As always, the choices are not that simple.\n\nJoining me with the story of the policies and priorities behind the budget debate is NewsHour political editor Lisa Desjardins.\n\nThank you for joining us again, Lisa.\n\nAnd maybe you can explain this for us. They\u2019re talking about $5 trillion in savings in this proposed budget that the House leaders put out today. What does that represent?\n\nLISA DESJARDINS, Political Reporter & Editor: Five trillion dollars in savings is over 10 years. That represents two priorities for Republicans.\n\nWhat they are choosing with this budget, let\u2019s just put it simply, is they\u2019re choosing to try to pay down the debt. They would balance the budget in a remarkable nine years. Usually, it\u2019s 10 years. And then the other priority they\u2019re choosing here, Gwen, is defense. Even as they\u2019re paying down the deficit and the debt ultimately, they also are increasing spending for defense.\n\nThat\u2019s a bit like trying to dig out a hole even as you\u2019re putting more dirt in it. It\u2019s very ambitious. Because those are their priorities, this would mean dramatic cuts for everyone else, for discretionary funding, which means most of government. Very hard to see these cuts taking place without government layoffs, for example.\n\nGWEN IFILL: That kind of austerity that they\u2019re calling for, the president came out today and basically said, hey, we need infrastructure, we need to spend on all these things, and, by the way, the economy is doing better now, there won\u2019t be an appetite for it.\n\nDoes he have a point?\n\nLISA DESJARDINS: The Democrats are going to come back to this again and say, look at what we have done. We have already cut the deficit by tremendous amounts. This is overreach by Republicans. They\u2019re not looking at what America wants. Democrats argue America wants jobs. They\u2019re not worried about the debt as much.\n\nI think that\u2019s the debate that is going to play out here. What the calculus is \u2014 not everything is political, but there are a lot of politics in this document. They\u2019re calculating that their core, their Republican base still cares so much about the debt that it\u2019s worth proposing these very strong cuts, not only to agencies, but also Pell Grants, for example, would have sort of less stable funding under this plan.\n\nGWEN IFILL: Does the budget process itself \u2014 I think that word process always puts people off, but it seems to me there is a reason why these kinds of priorities are put forward in a budget proposal, especially one that we routinely say may not go as far as they\u2019d like. What is the purpose for putting this stuff in a budget proposal?\n\nLISA DESJARDINS: Yes, I could see our viewers saying, why are they even talking about this? This is just a budget. It isn\u2019t binding.\n\nBut this is, Gwen, is, this is a show of what Republicans\u2019 priorities are. That\u2019s one. This is their one chance in a gridlocked Congress to say, here\u2019s what we stand for, and here\u2019s why it\u2019s especially significant. A budget falls under special rules in Congress. You can get a budget through the Senate with a magical 51 votes, instead of 60 votes, and Republicans are going to latch on to that.\n\nOne thing they have in this budget that is major policy priority, the repeal of something called Obamacare.\n\nGWEN IFILL: Well, I wanted to ask you about that, because this proposal, in order for it to balance out the way they have it planned, you would not only have to repeal Obamacare, but also cut back the Dodd-Frank financial reform regulations that are in place, and that doesn\u2019t sound like anything that\u2019s going to be bipartisan.\n\nLISA DESJARDINS: No, it\u2019s not going to be bipartisan.\n\nBut they know that the only way they are going to actually get a repeal of both of those through the Senate is to attach it to the budget and go through that special budget rule that lets you pass things with 51 votes. Everyone knows the president will still veto that policy if it comes to his desk, but they want to make a statement here. They want to have both chambers try and pass this.\n\nGWEN IFILL: And the one thing that they agree, that both sides agree they don\u2019t want to cut is defense spending. Right?\n\nLISA DESJARDINS: That\u2019s right.\n\nThe defense agency, Pentagon, anything to do with defense, which is not just the Pentagon, does well in this budget. One thing to watch for that is in this budget is, they have increased funding to a fund that\u2019s just for war contingency spending. Some people call that a slush fund. The Pentagon says it\u2019s a fund that\u2019s important.\n\nBut it deals with how the Pentagon operates on foreign soil fighting terror, and Republicans have increased that fund.\n\nGWEN IFILL: So interesting. We will be following this. And I know you will.\n\nLISA DESJARDINS: Oh, yes. I love it.\n\nGWEN IFILL: Lisa, I know you do.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nGWEN IFILL: Lisa Desjardins, thanks.\n\nLISA DESJARDINS: Sure.", "article_metadata": {"description": "House Republicans revealed their 2016 budget plan, pushing for deep cuts to lower the deficit, while preserving defense spending.
