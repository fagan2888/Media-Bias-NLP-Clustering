A Mississippi hospital says it has seen a surge in the number of emergency room visits related to "spice," a potent synthetic drug meant to produce a high similar to marijuana.

A doctor with the University of Mississippi Medical Center says that during the past five days, seven patients in the hospital's emergency department had ingested the synthetic drug. He says patients have been agitated and combative, with some having seizures. Symptoms also include low blood pressure and vomiting.

Earlier this year, UMMC treated more than three dozen patients who had taken synthetic drugs.
