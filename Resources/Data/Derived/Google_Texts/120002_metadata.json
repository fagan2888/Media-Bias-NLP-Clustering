Shutterstock\n\nAfter receiving complaints from an epilepsy charity, Twitter pulled a brightly colored, flashing Vine advertisement from its website Friday.\n\n@TwitterUK had uploaded two short videos featuring a rapid succession of flashing colors for its new #DiscoverMusic campaign, which is designed to promote new artists. Epilepsy Action, a charity focused on providing information about the condition, tweeted about the ads, calling them \u201cmassively dangerous.\u201d\n\nThe ad was up for 18 hours before it was removed. Rachel Bremer, Twitter\u2019s international communications director, tweeted back at Epilepsy Action thanking them for their feedback and saying that the ads had been removed. Epilepsy Action said it was \u201cpleased\u201d that Twitter removed the ads.\n\n\"Twitter's ads were dangerous to people living with photo-sensitive epilepsy,\" Epilepsy Action's Deputy Chief Executive Simon Wigglesworth told BBC.\n\nEpilepsy is a chronic disorder, the hallmark symptom of which is recurrent, unprovoked seizures. There are over 65 million people diagnosed with epilepsy worldwide, making it the fourth most common neurological disorder. With Twitter\u2019s massive online presence, the ads \u2014 whose bright lights and bold patterns could potentially produce seizures in those with light-sensitive epilepsy \u2014 would have reached many people. In the UK alone, about 3,500 people suffer from photosensitive epilepsy, according to Epilepsy Action.\n\n\"Eighty-seven people are diagnosed with epilepsy every day and that first seizure can often come out of nowhere,\" Wigglesworth said.\" For a huge corporation like Twitter to take that risk was irresponsible.\"\n\nThe Advertising Standards Authority told BBC that \"marketing communications,\" even those uploaded on a company's own website, should not include \"visual effects or techniques that are likely to adversely affect members of the public with photosensitive epilepsy.\"\n\nIn 1997, an episode of the popular cartoon Pok\u00e9mon was blamed for triggering seizures. The incident helped pinpoint a specific type of epilepsy; one where color changes trigger a seizure rather than only light changes. This led Japanese researchers to propose a subcategory of photosensitive epilepsy called chromatic sensitive epilepsy.\n\nAny type of photosensitive epileptic could have been affected by the Twitter ad since it included both light and color changes. But hopefully Twitter removed the ad before it happened.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "twitter, pulls, flashing, vine, ad, after, epilepsy, charity, says, it, may, cause, seizures", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Twitter had a brightly colored, flashing advertisement up for 18 hours before it was removed after concerns it could trigger epileptic seizures.", "title": "Twitter Removes Vine Ad After Complaints It Could Cause A Seizure", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/twitter-pulls-flashing-vine-ad-after-epilepsy-charity-says-it-may-cause-seizures-342584", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/07/11/shutterstock257951033.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Twitter had a brightly colored, flashing advertisement up for 18 hours before it was removed after concerns it could trigger epileptic seizures.", "title": "Twitter Removes Vine Ad After Complaints It Could Cause A Seizure", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/twitter-pulls-flashing-vine-ad-after-epilepsy-charity-says-it-may-cause-seizures-342584", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/07/11/shutterstock257951033.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/07/11/shutterstock257951033.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-07-11T17:25:33-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-07-11T17:27:41-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Twitter had a brightly colored, flashing advertisement up for 18 hours before it was removed after concerns it could trigger epileptic seizures."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe234b\"", "article_summary": "\"Twitter's ads were dangerous to people living with photo-sensitive epilepsy,\" Epilepsy Action's Deputy Chief Executive Simon Wigglesworth told BBC.\nIn the UK alone, about 3,500 people suffer from photosensitive epilepsy, according to Epilepsy Action.\nShutterstockAfter receiving complaints from an epilepsy charity, Twitter pulled a brightly colored, flashing Vine advertisement from its website Friday.\nThis led Japanese researchers to propose a subcategory of photosensitive epilepsy called chromatic sensitive epilepsy.\nEpilepsy Action said it was \u201cpleased\u201d that Twitter removed the ads."}
