A man who tweeted a photo of his young son clutching a severed head. A teenager who is believed to have turned suicide bomber, and others suspected of attempting to travel to Syria to join the Islamic State movement. All of them, Australian.\n\nThe London-based International Center for the Study of Radicalization and Political Violence reports that between 100 and 250 Australians have joined Sunni militants in Iraq and Syria. Given Australia\u2019s vast distance from the region and its population of just 24 million, it is a remarkable number. The center estimates that about 100 fighters came from the United States, which has more than 13 times as many people as Australia.\n\nExperts disagree about why Islamic State has been so effective recruiting in Australia, which is widely regarded as a multicultural success story, with an economy in an enviable 24th year of continuous growth.\n\nPossible explanations include that some Australian Muslims are poorly integrated with the rest of the country, and that Islamic State recruiters have given Australia particular attention. In addition, the Australian government failed to keep tabs on some citizens who had been radicalized, and moderate Muslims have been put off by some of Prime Minister Tony Abbott\u2019s comments about their community.\n\nGreg Barton, a global terrorism expert at Monash University in Melbourne, said Australia and some other countries underestimated Islamic State\u2019s \u201cpull factor.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re all coming to terms with the fact that this is a formidable targeter and predatory recruiter that goes after individuals one by one with a very masterful use of technology, and our sense of confidence that because we\u2019ve got society working well makes us secure misses the point,\u201d Barton said.\n\nMuslims make up about 2.2 percent of the population in Australia, compared to just 1 percent in the United States. And while many U.S. Muslims are from families who migrated in pursuit of the American economic dream, a larger proportion of Australian Muslims are from families who fled Lebanon\u2019s civil war in the 1970s and \u201980s.\n\nAustralian Muslims of Lebanese origin are largely based in Sydney, the country\u2019s biggest city. They have been less successful in integrating into Australian society than many other groups, and the first Australian-born generation of these migrant families has been overrepresented in terrorism offenses and general street crime.\n\nMohammad Ali Baryalei, an ethnic Lebanese who reportedly became a high-ranking member of Islamic State\u2019s operational command, was formerly a Sydney nightclub bouncer and bit-part television actor. Australian security agencies suspect he single-handedly recruited dozens of Australians and helped them enter Syria.\n\nOnce a Sydney street preacher with the Muslim group Street Dawah, Baryalei was reportedly killed in battle in Syria last fall at age 33. The Australian government has yet to confirm his death.\n\nBaryalei is accused in court documents of inciting from afar Islamic State sympathizers in Sydney to brutally slay a randomly selected victim. Security services recorded a telephone conversation between him and Omarjan Azari, who is awaiting trial on charges that include preparing to commit a terrorist act.\n\n\u201cWhat you guys need to do is pick any random unbeliever,\u201d Baryalei allegedly told Azari, according to court testimony. \u201cBackpacker, tourist, American, French or British, even better.\u201d\n\nSydney-born Khaled Sharrouf, also ethnic Lebanese, horrified millions last year by posting on his Twitter account a photo of his 7-year-old son clutching the severed head of a Syrian soldier. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry described the image as \u201cone of the most disturbing, stomach-turning, grotesque photographs ever displayed.\u201d\n\nSharrouf\u2019s appearance on the Syrian battlefield highlighted a flaw in Australia\u2019s defenses against Islamic State: lax border security. Sharrouf had served a prison sentence in Australia for planning a foiled terrorist attack and had been banned from leaving the country, but used his brother\u2019s passport to leave in 2013.\n\nThe Australian government acknowledged there was a problem with a system of airport security that was more focused on who was coming in than on who was leaving. The government announced in August that biometric screening will be rolled out at all Australian international airports as part of 630 million Australian dollars ($500 million) in new spending on intelligence, law enforcement and border protection.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Australia a puzzling hotbed of Islamic State recruiting", "title": "Australia a puzzling hotbed of Islamic State recruiting", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Australia a puzzling hotbed of Islamic State recruiting", "title": "Australia a puzzling hotbed of Islamic State recruiting", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/03/22/australia_a_puzzling_hotbed_of_islamic_state_recruiting/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/03/australia-homegrown-terror.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Australia a puzzling hotbed of Islamic State recruiting", "title": "Australia a puzzling hotbed of Islamic State recruiting", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/03/australia-homegrown-terror.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Rod Mcguirk", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce555\"", "article_summary": "Possible explanations include that some Australian Muslims are poorly integrated with the rest of the country, and that Islamic State recruiters have given Australia particular attention.\nBaryalei is accused in court documents of inciting from afar Islamic State sympathizers in Sydney to brutally slay a randomly selected victim.\nA teenager who is believed to have turned suicide bomber, and others suspected of attempting to travel to Syria to join the Islamic State movement.\nExperts disagree about why Islamic State has been so effective recruiting in Australia, which is widely regarded as a multicultural success story, with an economy in an enviable 24th year of continuous growth.\nU.S. Secretary of State John Kerry described the image as \u201cone of the most disturbing, stomach-turning, grotesque photographs ever displayed.\u201dSharrouf\u2019s appearance on the Syrian battlefield highlighted a flaw in Australia\u2019s defenses against Islamic State: lax border security."}
