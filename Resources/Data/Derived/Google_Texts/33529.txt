Embed Obama Reacts to Reported Murder of Pilot By ISIS 0:55 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog

President Barack Obama said Tuesday that an ISIS video that purports to show a Jordanian pilot being burned alive is one more indication that the militants are "only interested in death and destruction."

Obama was asked about the video by reporters at the end of a White House event to promote the Affordable Care Act. He said that he had just received word of the video and did not know whether it was authentic.

"But should in fact this video be authentic, it's just one more indication of the viciousness and barbarity of this organization," the president said. "And I think it will redouble the vigilance and determination on the part of a global coalition to make sure that they are degraded and ultimately defeated. And it also just indicates the degree to which whatever ideology they're operating off of, it's bankrupt."

"We're here to talk about how to make people healthier and make their lives better," he added. "And this organization appears only interested in death and destruction."
