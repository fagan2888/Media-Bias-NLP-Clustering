College Hockey: UNH stuns Providence in OT, heads to quarterfinals



— Just thrilling.



That’s the only adjective that appropriately describes eighth-seeded New Hampshire’s 2-1 overtime victory over second-seeded Providence College in the third and deciding game of their Hockey East quarterfinal series Sunday night.

..

Jay Camper’s fourth goal of the season at 12:43 of overtime propelled the Wildcats into the semifinals and a matchup against Boston University on Friday at TD Garden.



Brett Pesce blasted a shot from inside the blue line and Camper deflected the puck in for arguably the most important goal of his four-year career.

..

Just like in the first two games of the series, neither team was able to score in the opening period. But whereas the Wildcats (19-18-2) had zero quality scoring opportunities the Friars had at least two — each coming during the same sequence.

..

Noel Acciari burst down the slot and unloaded a shot that was blocked by Danny Tirone (31 saves). The rebound came to Brian Pinho who rifled a shot that hit the crossbar.



The Wildcats’ offense was so ineffective during the first period that they went 6:26 without a shot and managed only that one shot during the first 11:10.

..

Tirone did his best to keep the Friars (23-13-2) off the scoreboard during the period’s lone power play when he recorded three saves.



At period’s end, Providence had outshot New Hampshire, 8-3.



New Hampshire killed off another penalty early in the second period (holding Providence to zero shots) when the one Wildcat who’s feasted on the Friars this season gave his team a 1-0 lead.

..

Shane Eiserman, who was positioned near the left boards, passed to Grayson Downing in the high slot and Downing blasted a slap shot that clanged in off the bottom of the crossbar and behind Jon Gillies (25) at 7:06.

..

The goal was Downing’s fifth in five games against Providence.



New Hampshire came within inches of taking a 2-0 lead into intermission when Brett Pesce’s shot hit the left post with just under three minutes remaining.

..

The fact only two minor penalties were assessed during the first two periods was noteworthy because, at various stages of the second, play morphed into a series of “mini-scrums” that could have escalated into something more serious.

..

UNH’s lead only lasted 80 seconds into the third period when PC tied it during a scramble in front of the net.



Tirone blocked shots by Brandon Tanev and Acciari. But when the Wildcats were unable to clear the puck, Nick Saracino buried it at 1:20.

..

Saracino now has 8-6-14 totals in 14 career games against the Wildcats.



UNH went on a power play shortly after Saracino’s goal but failed to put a single shot on Gillies.



The Friars then had their chance to break the tie during a power play but Tirone blocked a flurry of shots (five to be precise).

..

UNH had one more opportunity to win the game in regulation when it went on a power play with 2:05 left but only managed one shot on goal.



PC’s Josh Monk was whistled for boarding at 1:09 of overtime but the Wildcats came up empty on their third power play.

..

UNH’s Matt Willows had a golden opportunity to win it when his shot off a rebound hit the left side of the net midway through the extra session.
