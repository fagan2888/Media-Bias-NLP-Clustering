They talked about what was for dinner, but not about the weather.\n\nThen she screamed. The screen on Ruben Porras\u2019 phone went dark. The call dropped.\n\nHe used a Find My Friends app to find her location. He rushed to Interstate 30. Police cars were everywhere. Roads were blocked.\n\nHe parked his car and ran.\n\n\u201cI was just hoping she was still alive,\u201d said Porras, 31.\n\nAfter about a mile or so, he spotted what was left of her Yukon. He saw her inside. He grabbed her hand and tried to talk to her.\n\n\u201cShe wasn\u2019t responding,\u201d Porras said. \u201cShe had no pulse. She was gone.\u201d\n\nRuiz, 27, was one of 11 people killed in Saturday\u2019s storms. The tornado had tossed her SUV off an overpass, Porras said.\n\nOne of six siblings, Ruiz had four children of her own \u2014 Jasmine, 9; Michael, 7; Angela, 6; and Camila, 2.\n\nShe was a simple woman \u201cwith expensive tastes,\u201d Porras said, laughing. The day before the wreck, he got her Versace perfume, a stocking full of makeup, a Michael Kors bag and a Bluetooth headphone set for Christmas.\n\nBut, he said, she didn\u2019t need all that.\n\n\u201cI could bring her a chocolate, and that would make her happy,\u201d he said. \u201cBut she spoiled me, and I spoiled her back.\u201d\n\nRuiz met Porras online when she was 15 and known as \u201cimatxhoney214\u201d on AOL. He was a poor kid in East Dallas. She was a chess-playing, bossy Pleasant Grove girl, the second-oldest child in a big family.\n\nThe two stayed up late into the night, talking \u201cabout everything.\u201d They eventually switched to phones, but she could only talk to him after 9 p.m. to avoid outrageous cellphone bills and angry parents.\n\nThe couple\u2019s first date came later. His brother dropped him off at the movie theater to see Freddy vs. Jason.\n\nHe said about 20 of her relatives and friends came with her.\n\n\u201cThey were trying to scare me,\u201d Porras said. \u201cBut I stuck around.\u201d\n\nBy the next date, the posse shrank to 10. A year later they married.\n\nOne of the men who consoled him in his living room Sunday was among those who had been \u201cbreathing down\u201d his neck at the theater.\n\nThe couple worked together for the last three years as paralegals at Dallas attorney Glenn Tucker\u2019s office. Ruiz brought his wife breakfast all the time \u2014 Fuel City tacos or Subway, she wasn\u2019t picky. They ate lunch together every day.\n\nAnd she took care of him. She even bought him remote-control cars and the Hot Wheels that he had never had.\n\n\u201cShe said, \u2018You know what? You don\u2019t have to worry about that now. Whatever you didn\u2019t have as a kid, you get now, plus more,\u2019\u201d Porras said.\n\nPorras \u201cloved her to death.\u201d He had his wife\u2019s name tattooed on his left arm. She had his on her shoulder.\n\nThey planned to grow old together.\n\n\u201cI always told her, \u2018We\u2019re going to be two old-a\u2013 people, sitting back, fishing,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cShe didn\u2019t much like the fishing part. But she liked the sitting out by the lake part.\u201d\n\nRuiz\u2019s big family surrounded him and the children Sunday. He cried often, but managed a few laughs as they talked about the past.\n\n\u201cShe was always happy,\u201d he said.\n\nBut he blamed himself for letting her go out and not being more careful. He wasn\u2019t holding up well, he said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really not. But I\u2019ve got to show strength for these children. I\u2019m going to have to fulfill whatever she wanted for them. \u2026 I\u2019m not going to let her down.\u201d\n\nThen he turned to his daughter and said, \u201cWe\u2019re going to make Mommy proud.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"liveFyreID": "aHR0cDovL3RoZXNjb29wYmxvZy5kYWxsYXNuZXdzLmNvbS8yMDE1LzEyL2hlYXJ0YnJlYWtpbmctY2FsbC1kdXJpbmctc3Rvcm0td2FzLWNvdXBsZXMtbGFzdC5odG1sLw==", "generator": "WordPress 3.9.12", "author": "Tristan Hallman", "og": {"site_name": "The Scoop Blog", "description": "MESQUITE \u2014 Petra Ruiz called her husband on FaceTime and put her phone in the cup holder of her Yukon.
