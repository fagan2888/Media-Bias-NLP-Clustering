The HVAC unit was found to be the source of the problem.\n\nOKCPS will be removing that unit on Tuesday to replace it with a new one. While the building is now considered safe, the district has decided to err on the side of caution by closing the school on Tuesday.\n\nThe OKCPS Operations Team will conduct additional scans Tuesday to reassess and confirm the safety of the building.\n\nFive students were treated at the scene, one of them transported by EMSA. Two students were taken to the hospital by their parents.
