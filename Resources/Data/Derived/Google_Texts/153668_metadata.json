Coach Patrick Roy put his team through a 60-minute workout, much of it emphasizing the power play battle situations in the corners.\n\nRoy did not meet with the media Friday, but the day before he listed his expectations for the near future when play resumes.\n\n\u201cTo me, the important thing is that we keep working on details and we apply those details really well, and no bad habits,\u201d Roy said. \u201cThat\u2019s what you want to make sure of when you play your first game back (Wednesday against Los Angeles). We\u2019re preparing for (Wednesday).\u201d\n\nRoy put his players through two down-and-back hard skating sessions at the end of both practices. After a day off Saturday, Roy said he will emphasize more strategic drills and not as much skating.\n\nGoalie Semyon Varlamov arrived in Denver early Friday morning, but did not practice. It is unclear when he will resume practice again.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477afa6914bd0286fe5925\"", "article_summary": "Coach Patrick Roy put his team through a 60-minute workout, much of it emphasizing the power play battle situations in the corners.\nIt was a quiet second day post-Olympic break practice for the Avalanche Friday.\nRoy did not meet with the media Friday, but the day before he listed his expectations for the near future when play resumes.\nAfter a day off Saturday, Roy said he will emphasize more strategic drills and not as much skating.\n\u201cTo me, the important thing is that we keep working on details and we apply those details really well, and no bad habits,\u201d Roy said."}
