(AP Photo/Daily News, Austin Anthony) (Photo: AP )\n\nBoat tours of Lost River Cave have been offered for years, but now people can explore the underground river in a different way \u2014 by kayak.\n\n\u201cIt offers such a personal eye window of the cave,\u201d said Carlet Hagan of Smiths Grove, who developed the Kayaking in the Cave Tour. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of free roam. You get to go places the boat can\u2019t go. Even if they\u2019ve been in the cave before, they can see it in a total new perspective.\u201d\n\nLost River Cave received a grant from the General Motors Foundation to buy nine kayaks, and Hagan, an intern at the cave completing a recreation administration degree at Western Kentucky University, created the kayaking tour in just eight weeks.\n\n\u201cAll around here, kayaking has been more popular. We just kind of went with the flow with it,\u201d she said.\n\nThe two-hour tour covers the cave\u2019s history and includes activities such as scavenger hunts, obstacle courses, time trials and kayak basketball.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s built for families that need a get-together,\u201d Hagan said. \u201cIt\u2019s built for companies. They can come and have fun team-building exercises.\u201d\n\nSeveral groups have previewed the Kayaking in the Cave Tour to work out any kinks. During a recent night tour with a group of preteen boys, the most popular activity seemed to be kayak basketball, in which participants threw small squeeze balls into each other\u2019s kayaks to score.\n\n\u201cIt was fun because you had to move around and paddle at the same time as you\u2019re trying to score,\u201d said Ben Carroll, 12, of Bowling Green.\n\nTouring the cave in a kayak gave him a different experience than the regular boat tour.\n\n\u201cI could really just look around at anything because I had a head lamp,\u201d Ben said of the kayak tour. \u201cWithout it, you kind of have to look where they show you.\u201d\n\nSam Wheeler, 11, of Bowling Green, kayaked for the first time recently inside the cave.\n\n\u201cIt was hard, but fun,\u201d he said. \u201cI thought it was more fun to kayak than get on a boat because you got to do something fun.\u201d\n\nNo kayaking experience is needed to participate in the tour, because there are no rapids and the water is shallow enough to stand up in if someone tips over. All participants receive water safety and basic paddling instructions.\n\n\u201cThey automatically start building confidence in kayaking,\u201d said Rho Lansden, executive director of Lost River Cave.\n\nThe tour will be offered year-round.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the great thing, ... we\u2019re the same temperature,\u201d Hagan said. \u201cWhether it\u2019s zero outside, it\u2019s still 40 to 50 degrees down here.\u201d\n\nLost River Cave kayak tour\n\nCost: $25 a person; reservations required and a week\u2019s notice recommended.\n\nRestrictions: Groups of three to seven people; ages 6 and up.\n\nWhen: Year-round; any evening starting at 6:30.\n\nContact: (270) 393-0077.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://cjky.it/1s00vdk", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Boat tours of Lost River Cave have been offered for years, but now people can explore the underground river in a different way \u2014 by kayak.", "og": {"site_name": "The Courier-Journal", "description": "Boat tours of Lost River Cave have been offered for years, but now people can explore the underground river in a different way \u2014 by kayak.", "title": "Cave kayaking tour offers subterranean fun", "url": "http://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/local/2014/08/02/cave-kayaking-tour-offers-subterranean-fun/13525585/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/courier-journal.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Boat tours of Lost River Cave have been offered for years, but now people can explore the underground river in a different way \u2014 by kayak.", "title": "Cave kayaking tour offers subterranean fun", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/d324205b27385800efa347ff5e5b02cf2f366af1/c=334-0-1667-1333&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/Louisville/2014/08/02/cavekayaking2.jpg", "creator": "@courierjournal", "site": "@courierjournal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600030236", "fb": {"app_id": 128534137209813}, "viewport": "width=1070", "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"category": "news/local", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/ac20add3f92adfd1d6e695591937e6e42c30dd09/c=500-0-1500-1333/local/-/media/Louisville/2014/08/02/cavekayaking2.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/46837b90ae998993d99356e31057d6d0ad0c3903/c=334-0-1667-1333/local/-/media/Louisville/2014/08/02/cavekayaking2.jpg", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/65cf2a46e294251efac8980d44d4354bd635d5ce/c=112-0-1889-1333/local/-/media/Louisville/2014/08/02/cavekayaking2.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/6ad857ff3f471a9f423b391a57ab1297845aebf6/c=0-104-2000-1229&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/Louisville/2014/08/02/cavekayaking2.jpg", "publishtime": "2014-08-02T19:30:32-04:00", "shorthed": "Cave kayaking tour offers subterranean fun", "articleid": 13525585, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/3d93021e91b0ec7a084ab7d527e0eff44827b6fb/c=0-104-2000-1229/local/-/media/Louisville/2014/08/02/cavekayaking2.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/f8e536322b64e5e9bd07b1b166217d069e2b028e/c=625-0-1375-1333/local/-/media/Louisville/2014/08/02/cavekayaking2.jpg"}, "gci-asset-type": "story", "author": "Laurel Wilson", "pageclass": "article", "title": "Cave kayaking tour offers subterranean fun"}, "news_keywords": ""}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd39ae\"", "article_summary": "\u201cIt offers such a personal eye window of the cave,\u201d said Carlet Hagan of Smiths Grove, who developed the Kayaking in the Cave Tour.\nBlake Anderson, 12, and Mason Hagan, 6, tour Lost River Cave in a group tour on July 25, 2014, in Bowling Green, Ky.\nThey can come and have fun team-building exercises.\u201dSeveral groups have previewed the Kayaking in the Cave Tour to work out any kinks.\n\u201cThey automatically start building confidence in kayaking,\u201d said Rho Lansden, executive director of Lost River Cave.\n\u201cI could really just look around at anything because I had a head lamp,\u201d Ben said of the kayak tour."}
