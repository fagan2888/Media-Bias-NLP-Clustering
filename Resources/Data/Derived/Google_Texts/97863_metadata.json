The church\u2019s signs are at the center of a legal debate that pits local government against the First Amendment.\n\nReed\u2019s signs are similar in size to garage sale signs with placards on wire legs that stick in the ground. But if he continued posting them, he could have faced criminal fines and even jail time under Gilbert\u2019s sign ordinance. Attorney David Cortman with Alliance Defending Freedom saw that as a violation of freedom of speech and equal protection under the Constitution. He said the town\u2019s code discriminated by treating signs differently based on what they said.\n\n\u201cPolitical signs may be 32 square feet, may be unlimited in number, and may be placed in the right-of-way of the entire town for five months before the election. But the church\u2019s signs can only be one-fifth of that size, only placed in the dark of night, the night before the church service,\u201d Cortman said.\n\nThe town\u2019s attorney, Phillip Savrin, argued the sign rules were reasonable. Certain categories of signs\u2014ideological ones, for example\u2014should have more leeway in time, manner, and place. But the church sign is different. It\u2019s in the \u201cdirectional\u201d category. And signs like those, Savrin argued, just clutter up spaces.\n\nJustice Antonin Scalia said directions fell under free speech rights.\n\n\u201cI mean, ideological signs, that is just a content category, and there is as much a First Amendment right to give somebody directions as there is to speak about being green or whatever else,\u201d he said. \u201cIs there no First Amendment right to give somebody directions?\u201d\n\nThe justices seemed sympathetic to towns wanting to regulate signs in some way, but tried to find a governing principle that would protect constitutional rights.\n\n\u201cShould the government be deciding what speech is more valuable than others?\u201d Cortman asked. \u201cBecause that is exactly what it did in this case.\u201d\n\nBut Justice Anthony Kennedy explained why that logic poses a problem.\n\n\u201cI guess you see the concern: If an affluent person wants to celebrate a birthday, he can put \u2018Happy Birthday, Uncle Fred\u2019 as many places as a political sign, and for as long,\u201d he said.\n\nQuestioning bogged down in tiny details, such as whether a mere arrow pointing in one direction would be a directional sign, or something else.\n\n\u201cSo they could put up an \u2018ideological\u2019 sign that says, \u2018Come to our service on Sunday morning,\u2019 but no arrow, and then they put up another sign that says, this is the arrow?\u201d Justice Samuel Alito asked.\n\nWhile the town\u2019s attorney acknowledged the ordinance treats signs differently based on content, he said the alternative\u2014treating all signs the same\u2014would limit free speech even more. To prevent unsightly sign clutter, towns would have to develop one-size-fits-all rules that would apply strict limits to all signs.\n\nDespite the humor and sometimes tedious questioning, this case has big implications going forward. Nobody denies that too many signs are unattractive and can lower property values. But the question is, how does government manage that? Many workable alternatives to the Gilbert solution exist.\n\nFor its part, the court has to provide guidance on how lower courts ought to judge sign ordinances and how much leeway the courts ought to give local governments.\n\nIf the church wins, government power to favor some speech over others would be reined in. If the town wins, that means broader power for government to disfavor certain kinds of speech.\n\nListen to \u201cLegal Docket\u201d on The World and Everything in It.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "WORLD", "description": "Last week, the pastor of a small church in Gilbert, Ariz., introduced himself on the steps outside of the Supreme Court.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n  \u201cI\u2019m Clyde Reed, pastor", "title": "WORLD | One pastor\u2019s tedious defense of the First Amendment | Mary Reichard | Jan. 19, 2015", "url": "http://www.worldmag.com/2015/01/one_pastor_s_tedious_defense_of_the_first_amendment", "image": "http://www.worldmag.com/media/images/content/ap557441064211.jpg", "type": "article"}, "keywords": "world magazine, christian world news magazine, christian views, christian perspectives, god's world magazine", "description": "Last week, the pastor of a small church in Gilbert, Ariz., introduced himself on the steps outside of the Supreme Court.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n  \u201cI\u2019m Clyde Reed, pastor"}, "article_summary": "Last week, the pastor of a small church in Gilbert, Ariz., introduced himself on the steps outside of the Supreme Court.\nBut the church sign is different.\nThe church\u2019s signs are at the center of a legal debate that pits local government against the First Amendment.\nTo prevent unsightly sign clutter, towns would have to develop one-size-fits-all rules that would apply strict limits to all signs.\n\u201cI\u2019m Clyde Reed, pastor of Good News Community Church in Gilbert, Ariz.,\u201d he said."}
