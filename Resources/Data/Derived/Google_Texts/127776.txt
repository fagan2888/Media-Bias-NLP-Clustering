Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) officially announced his candidacy for the 2016 GOP presidential nomination just after midnight on Twitter Monday — and the date, March 23, has some significance.

The Cruz campaign revealed that the Texas senator chose the date because it’s the “anniversary of the disaster known as Obamacare.”

President Barack Obama signed the Affordable Care Act into law on March 23, 2010.

The reason why @tedcruz announced his bid today is simple. It's the anniversary of the disaster known as Obamacare. #Cruz2016 — Ted Cruz 2016 (@ReigniteAmerica) March 23, 2015

Cruz became the first Republican to declare candidacy for 2016 — though the GOP field is expected to be crowded.

Minutes after Cruz made the major announcement, tedcruz.org transformed into the conservative senator’s official 2016 campaign website. He also released his first campaign video, titled “A Time for Truth.” Watch below:
