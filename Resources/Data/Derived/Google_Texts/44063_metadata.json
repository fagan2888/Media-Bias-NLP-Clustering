These fees help cover the TSA\u2019s baggage and behavior screening programs.\n\nRelated: Report Says TSA Wasted $1 Billion on Screening Program\n\nPut in place after the attacks of September 11, 2001, the fee is currently capped at $10, but with the change, travelers will pay at least $11.20 \u2014 or more depending on how long their flights and layovers are. Flights after layovers of more than four hours for domestic trips or more than 12 hours between domestic and international flights will incur an additional fee.\n\nThese fees are built into the total price of an airline ticket.\n\nAn extra few dollars here and there may not sound like much, but they can add up, especially on business trips. As the TSA detailed recently, a trip from Newark to Las Vegas with stopovers in Chicago and Denver on the way out and Chicago on the way back would count as one round trip and incur fees of $10 under past regulations. Now, that same trip will count as five one-way trips and the fees would total $28. Travelers who live in more remote locations and have to take connecting flights could also be hurt by the change.\n\nThe rate increase stems from a bipartisan budget deal passed by lawmakers last December. TSA says the fee will pay for \"the increased cost of securing the nation's transportation systems.\u201d Last year, the security fees raised more than $1.8 billion for TSA \u2014 about 20 percent of its $8 billion annual budget.\n\nThe House Budget Committee estimates that this year\u2019s rate hike will cover about 43 percent of TSA\u2019s 2014 budget.\n\nThe rate increase comes almost exactly a year after federal auditors questioned the effectiveness of TSA\u2019s billion dollar screening program, saying that the agency has no way of knowing whether its pricey behavioral screening tactics are even working.\n\nThe fee hike also comes as air travel in general keeps getting more expensive. An analysis done by the Associated Press found that the average domestic roundtrip ticket, including tax, was $363.42 in 2013, up more than $7 from the prior year. The AP analyzed fare data from the Airlines Reporting Corporation, which processes ticket transactions for airlines and more than 9,400 travel agencies, including websites such as Expedia and Orbitz. It found that airfare has risen by nearly 12 percent since 2009. It\u2019s only expected to keep soaring.\n\nTop Reads from the Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Heads up, travelers: Airfare is about to get a little more expensive, courtesy of Cong", "title": "Another Reason to Hate the TSA", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/07/01/Another-Reason-Hate-TSA", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/06072013_TSA_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/07/01/Another-Reason-Hate-TSA", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/06072013_TSA_article.jpg", "creator": "@Briannaehley", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Heads up, travelers: Airfare is about to get a little more expensive, courtesy of Cong", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fccc91\"", "article_summary": "Heads up, travelers: Airfare is about to get a little more expensive, courtesy of Congress and everyone\u2019s favorite federal agency (to hate).\nBeginning on July 21, the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) will increase its passenger security fees from $2.50 per flight to a flat rate of $5.60 each way.\nTSA says the fee will pay for \"the increased cost of securing the nation's transportation systems.\u201d Last year, the security fees raised more than $1.8 billion for TSA \u2014 about 20 percent of its $8 billion annual budget.\nThe House Budget Committee estimates that this year\u2019s rate hike will cover about 43 percent of TSA\u2019s 2014 budget.\nThese fees help cover the TSA\u2019s baggage and behavior screening programs."}
