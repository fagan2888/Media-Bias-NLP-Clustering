(via @GiseleOfficial)\n\nTom Brady played some good football on Sunday, beating the Lions 34-9 -- which is a really spooky number! -- in the Patriots latest easy victory.\n\nMaybe Brady, like Colts receiver T.Y. Hilton, was inspired by fatherhood? Surely before he left for the stadium he saw his daughter dressed up in a Brady jersey getting set for a day of football.\n\nIf not, he probably saw the picture after the game, since Gisele posted it on social media during the game.\n\nGo daddy go!!! #gopats ???
