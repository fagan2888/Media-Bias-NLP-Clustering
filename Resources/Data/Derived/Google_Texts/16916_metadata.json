Gag orders and censoring medical providers\n\nFlorida, my beloved home state, has been the leader in this regard. In 2011 it passed a sweeping law barring doctors from routinely asking patients whether they had guns in their homes, counseling them on common-sense firearm storage measures or recording any information about gun ownership in their medical files.\n\nNo matter that improperly secured guns pose serious health risks and that Americans are getting shot by toddlers on a weekly basis as a result. No matter that having a gun in the home is a high risk factor for (successful) suicide or fatal incidents of domestic violence.\n\nNo matter that doctors are allowed to talk to patients about the risks of all sorts of other household and recreational activities, including smoking, unprotected sex, using certain cleaning products or having backyard swimming pools.\n\nFor some reason, talking about firearm safety is different. In Florida, doctors who talk to their patients about guns as part of routine preventive care can have their medical licenses revoked.\n\nAt least 14 other states have introduced similar legislation, with weaker versions already instituted in Minnesota, Missouri and Montana.\n\nOther states have turned to muzzling a different kind of speech: information about the dangerous chemicals that patients may have been exposed to in fracking accidents.\n\nMany of the states where fracking occurs allow companies to withhold information from health-care providers and emergency responders about the chemicals they use, on the grounds that such information is a valuable \u201ctrade secret.\u201d States that have begun requiring companies to share these \u201ctrade secrets\u201d with doctors typically require that doctors first sign a confidentiality agreement with the companies.\n\nThat means that even when doctors can receive critical information about what\u2019s wrong with their patients, they can be barred from sharing this information with anyone else \u2014 including the patients. Texas, for example, requires confidentiality and does not allow sharing information with the patient.\n\n2. Requiring doctors to endorse junk science\n\nKansas and Texas, for example, require doctors to instruct patients that having an abortion will increase their risk of breast cancer, a contention that has been rejected by the World Health Organization, the American Cancer Society and other major health groups.\n\nArizona and Arkansas, on the other hand, require physicians to tell women that drug-induced abortions might be \u201creversible.\u201d Again, reputable organizations such as the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology say this claim is unsupported by scientific evidence.\n\n3. Intervening in the provision of care itself\n\nThe third way policymakers have politicized the exam room involves intervening in the provision of care itself, either to require medically unnecessary procedures (ultrasounds before abortions, for example) or delay medically appropriate ones.\n\nA growing number of states, incluing Texas, have instituted mandatory waiting periods for abortions. South Dakota has a 72-hour waiting period \u2014 and does not count weekends and state holidays in this interval, meaning that a patient could have to wait as long as six days if a long weekend follows her initial appointment. Incidentally, South Dakota has no waiting period at all for purchasing firearms.\n\nLook, there obviously is a role for policymakers to play in setting laws that promote public health. But those laws should be grounded in scientific evidence, not attempts to reward campaign donors, appease the political base and shame women.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not a scientist,\u201d politicians have lately taken to saying. Their actions suggest they \u2014 wrongly \u2014 believe otherwise.\n\nReach Catherine Rampell at crampell@washpost.com.
