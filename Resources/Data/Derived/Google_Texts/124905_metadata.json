When he was 8 years old, he read the obituary section of the newspaper daily, studying each line. \ufffd\ufffd\ufffdI wonder who this person was,\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd he would say, as he tried to share his interest with his mother. But she would shrug and mumble, \ufffd\ufffd\ufffdYou can never really know.\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd Noah wanted to know; he needed to know. He was searching, investigating. Who had these dead people been? Whom had they left behind? How old were they when they died and what had killed them? Could Noah die? Could his parents?\n\nDecades later, Noah starts his psychoanalysis with what he calls his \ufffd\ufffd\ufffdobsession with dead people.\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd He wants to know everything about these people in the obituaries, and I want to know everything about him. With each obituary that Noah brings in to the consulting room, we piece together our respective puzzles, hunting for the missing pieces to complete our pictures.\n\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdI got it,\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd Noah reports after hours of painstaking research, Googling, filling in the dates and details of the latest obituary. \ufffd\ufffd\ufffdI think I know everything. Now I can let it go.\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd Unlike Noah, I don\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdt get it. Missing many parts of Noah\ufffd\ufffd\ufffds personal history, I try to wait patiently for them to enter the room. I know from experience that sooner or later the missing pieces will appear. I just have to silently listen and invite them in.\n\nNoah becomes irritated when he is missing a piece in his puzzle. He holds the newspaper and reads aloud to me from an obituary of a woman named Marie, then rolls his eyes. \ufffd\ufffd\ufffdListen to how annoying this is,\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd he says. \ufffd\ufffd\ufffdHow come they write that \ufffd\ufffd\ufffdRonald\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd was her second husband? If you Google him, you find this same Ronald was also the translator of a book she co-wrote many years earlier with her first husband \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd who was also named Ronald.\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\nI am confused, and jokingly think to myself, \ufffd\ufffd\ufffdMaybe she only liked people named Ronald.\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd My reaction is a result of the fact that I have trouble following the details, which makes me anxious. I don\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdt yet fully understand Noah\ufffd\ufffd\ufffds interest in these facts about the dead.\n\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdBoth of her husbands were called Ronald \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd is that possible?\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd he wonders. \ufffd\ufffd\ufffdMarie married a Ronald and then another Ronald.\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd He counts the Ronalds again, as if he needs to make it clear that there is something behind those names, something more than meets the eye.\n\nNoah holds those who died in his mind and refuses to let them go. He embraces their stories as if they belong to him, and in that sense those people are neither alive nor dead but rather exist as ghosts, between two worlds, never fully seen but present in his life, and now in mine as well.\n\nAs I join Noah on his search, I become aware that ghosts \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd the ghosts of the dead, the ghosts of his history \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd haunt us both. We always know less than we want to.\n\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdHow old was your mother when you were born?\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd I ask him one day, trying to imagine his family.\n\nNoah answers: \ufffd\ufffd\ufffdForty-four, I think. Old, right?\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\nHe is almost 44 and doesn\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdt have children of his own.\n\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdAre you old?\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd I ask.\n\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdI guess so,\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd he says. \ufffd\ufffd\ufffdGrowing up as an only child to parents in their mid-40s wasn\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdt easy, and for some reason, I always imagined I had a twin brother who had died in childbirth. But I didn\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdt. My mother used to get annoyed when I joked about it. She thought it was another one of my crazy ideas about death. I secretly imagined we were both Noah. Noah One and Noah Two \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd like Thing One and Thing Two from the Dr. Seuss story.\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdAnd you, are you Noah One or Noah Two?\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd I ask.\n\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdOf course I am Noah Two, do I look like a Noah One?\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd he replies playfully. \ufffd\ufffd\ufffdIt reminds me of Ronald One and Ronald Two from Marie\ufffd\ufffd\ufffds life. Do you think she loved them equally? Don\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdt you think she married Ronald Two only because she missed her first Ronald and wished he were alive?\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\nI listen to Noah and think about the lonely little boy that he once was, preoccupied with the idea of the death of his parents and what he calls his \ufffd\ufffd\ufffdbizarre fantasies\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd about a lost brother. There are so many gaps in his narrative, so many missing details, and in his therapy we try to fill them in: to imagine who he used to be; to consider the meanings of his dreams and fantasies; to understand his childhood yearning for a brother and the anguish he constantly felt but couldn\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdt quite name.\n\nAs time passes, Noah stops investigating obituaries and begins to talk more about his own psychic losses, his symbolic deaths. We talk about the dead brother as representing the \ufffd\ufffd\ufffddead\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd parts of himself, including his depressive withdrawal from the world, and the emotionally deadened aspects of his parents, both of whom are still involved in his life. His mother, especially, has always struck him as disconnected, as if she is emotionally invested in something she has left behind.\n\nWe all have our phantoms. But as the psychoanalysts Maria Torok and Nicolas Abraham once wrote, \ufffd\ufffd\ufffdwhat haunts are not the dead, but the gaps left within us by the secrets of others.\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd They were referring to intergenerational secrets and unprocessed experiences that very often don\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdt have a voice or an image associated with them but loom in our minds nonetheless. We carry emotional material that belongs to our parents and grandparents, retaining losses of theirs that they never fully articulated. We feel these traumas even if we don\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdt consciously know them. Old family secrets live inside of us.\n\nONE Saturday night, I receive an email from Noah. \ufffd\ufffd\ufffdDr. Atlas,\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd he writes. \ufffd\ufffd\ufffdThis morning, two shocking things happened. I couldn\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdt wait until our session to tell you.\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd The first announcement is that his mother died early this morning. The second is that he has found his dead brother.\n\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdThis morning,\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd his email continues, \ufffd\ufffd\ufffdas I hugged my father, he told me that there was one thing they never wanted to burden me with. He said, \ufffd\ufffd\ufffdWe decided when you were little that you would never find out the secret until one of us died.\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd The secret is that there was another son, about a year older, who died before Noah was born.\n\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdMy parents have reserved their burial plots next to a very small grave,\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd Noah goes on. \ufffd\ufffd\ufffdWe will bury my mother there tomorrow afternoon. Noah One was buried there 44 years ago, at the age of 8 months, just a few months before I was born and named after him. They did not want to weigh me down with that, to cause me pain or devastation.\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\nAfter decades of searching, Noah Two can now complete the obituary.\n\nDetails have been altered to protect patient privacy.\n\nGalit Atlas, a faculty member in the postdoctoral program in psychotherapy and psychoanalysis at New York University, is the author of the forthcoming book \ufffd\ufffd\ufffdThe Enigma of Desire: Sex, Longing, and Belonging in Psychoanalysis.\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20150411144539, "BN": "opinionator", "dfp-ad-unit-path": "opinion/opinionator", "channels": "NytNow", "adxPage": "blog.nytimes.com/opinionator/post", "DISPLAYDATE": "April 11, 2015", "keywords": "Children and Childhood,Deaths (Obituaries),Psychology and Psychologists,Couch", "GBLC": "Couch", "news_keywords": "Children,Obituary,Psychology", "PT": "Blogs", "SCG": "opinionator", "sourceApp": "blogs", "twitter": {"url": "http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/04/11/a-tale-of-two-twins/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2015/04/12/sunday-review/12COUCH/12COUCH-thumbLarge.jpg", "description": "One boy was real.
