A major fundraiser for the Boys and Girls Club of East Mississippi is set for next weekend.

Executive Director Ricky Hood and his son Rodney joined our John Johnson on this weekend's edition of "On the Record." The Boys and Girls club annual Celebration of Excellence dinner is set for this Saturday night at the Frank Cochran Center in Meridian. Rodney, who was drafted by the Utah Jazz, will serve as the guest speaker.

"Boys and Girls Club meant a lot to me, you know, growing up," Hood recalls. "First of all, it keeps you off the streets. You know, it gives you something positive to do. I met my best friends there. You know, I learned how to play basketball there. It's more than just a place to go where they babysit you. You know, you learn a lot of different things."

The fundraising dinner starts at 6 p.m. Saturday.
