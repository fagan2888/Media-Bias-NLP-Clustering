Last year was the second consecutive year of job growth for the industry, but nevertheless it remains 8 percent smaller than before the financial crisis. Wall Street has accounted for less than 1 percent of the jobs added in New York City during the same period.\n\nThe average salary, including bonuses for securities industry workers in New York City, was more than $400,000 in 2014, the most recent year that data was available.\n\nA separate report released last fall by New York-based compensation consulting firm Johnson Associates predicted that fixed-income traders would take the biggest bonus hit, with year-end income falling up to 20 percent.
