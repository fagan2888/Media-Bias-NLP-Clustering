Rand Paul \u2013 has stepped in it yet again.\n\nAppearing recently on a radio show hosted by conservative commentator Hugh Hewitt, McConnell proudly proclaimed that the Senate thus far in 2015 has approved judicial nominees exclusively at the district court level. Only those who carried the support of Republican lawmakers made it through the confirmation process.\n\nMcConnell boasted that practice likely would continue \u2013 a statement certainly indicating that those nominated to slots on the various federal courts of appeal would not be considered.\n\n\u201cAnd do you expect that that will continue to be the case for the balance of this session?\u201d Hewitt asked.\n\n\u201cI think that\u2019s highly likely, yeah,\u201d McConnell said.\n\nIn making his plans known, McConnell, as has been his recent wont, made a commitment he couldn\u2019t possibly keep. He wants to, above all, maintain the GOP majority in the Senate after the 2016 elections and failing to confirm federal court nominees would almost certainly render that aim tenuous. Republicans currently hold a four-seat majority and Democrats already are expected to make at least a modest gain given that the presidential race will head the ballot.\n\nSen. Pat Toomey, R-Pennsylvania, for instance, is expected to face stiff opposition in a state that has consistently gone Democratic in presidential election years. A Pennsylvania seat is open on the U.S. Third Circuit Court of Appeals and Toomey has endorsed President Obama\u2019s nomination of U.S. District Judge Luis Felipe Restrepo. Toomey already is under pressure to address the situation and has offered assurances that the seat will be filled. So Any failure to get his choice through would not only establish that Toomey carries little influence but further alienate the growing Latino vote \u2014 Restrepo was born in Colombia.\n\nAnd McConnell wouldn\u2019t be doing himself any favors. Kentucky Supreme Court Justice Lisabeth Hughes Abramson, who hails from McConnell\u2019s adopted hometown of Louisville, is thought to be in line to succeed Boyce Martin, of Louisville, who resigned in August 2013 as a judge on the U.S. Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals in Cincinnati. Abramson, from all indications, is a superior judge and likely would whizz through the nomination process if she is, indeed, Obama\u2019s choice.\n\nMcConnell would be creating an unholy mess if he ignored Obama\u2019s judicial nominations. Civil trials would literally be backed up for years and it would be hard if not impossible to hold criminal trials in a timely manner as required by the U.S. Constitution.\n\nThat vacant position has been declared a \u201cjudicial emergency\u2019\u2019 by the Judicial Conference \u2013 one of 26 currently unfilled slots so designated. If McConnell followed through with his threat, Kentucky would be a vote short on the Sixth Circuit for at least four years, perhaps longer. And there is no assurance a delay would provide McConnell with a judicial nominee more to his liking if a Democrat (cough, Hillary Clinton, cough) follows Obama in the White House.\n\nAnd that\u2019s just the circuit courts. Overall there exist 58 vacancies on the combined circuit and district levels \u2013 including two district seats in Kentucky. And the Judicial Conference lists 22 future vacancies, citing anticipated resignations and retirements.\n\nIn other words, McConnell would be creating an unholy mess if he ignored Obama\u2019s judicial nominations. Civil trials would literally be backed up for years and it would be hard if not impossible to hold criminal trials in a timely manner as required by the U.S. Constitution.\n\nAs it is, McConnell has been slow-walking federal judicial nominees. Since assuming control of the upper chamber in January, the GOP majority has approved only four federal judgeships. During the last two years of their presidencies, when the Senate was controlled by opposing parties, Republicans President George W. Bush managed to get 10 appeals court judges confirmed while Democratic President Bill Clinton got 15 and Republican Ronald Reagan got 17. Democrats are starting to take notice. Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vermont, the former chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, asserted that Republicans are \u201cfailing to govern responsibly\u2019\u2019 when it comes to filling \u201cjudicial vacancies where they are needed.\u2019\u2019\n\nAdded Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid, of Nevada, \u201cWe\u2019re now here with the statements ringing loudly that the majority leader is intent on writing off the Senate\u2019s constitutional duty of offering our advice and consent.\u201d\n\nAware of the growing backlash, McConnell sent a spokesman out to deny the majority leader said what he obviously said.\n\n\u201cHe said nothing of the sort,\u2019\u2019 said press aide Don Stewart. \u201cHe said we\u2019re going to continue to do judges. There\u2019s not a shutdown. We probably will have a circuit court nominee.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2026probably will have a (singular) circuit court nominee.\u2019\u2019 Heartening indeed.\n\nSo, as is often the case with McConnell, the question that needs to be posed is: What game does he think he\u2019s playing? There are several possibilities.\n\nIt could be a McConnell gambit to force Obama to adopt Republican positions on some legislation \u2013 appropriations bills are going to begin piling up shortly \u2013 in return for judicial confirmations. If so it\u2019s a rather farcical strategy since the president will simply resort to nominating folks he wants without conferring with lawmakers of either party \u2013 something he has consistently done from all indications. And the pressure remains on McConnell, unless he\u2019s willing to maintain a trio of judicial vacancies in Kentucky for three years or more.\n\nSo strike that.\n\nIt could be he got carried away and was simply playing to the hardcore conservative audience that remains steadfastly opposed to anything Obama tries to accomplish. The remarks were made on a right-wing broadcast and undoubtedly those listening in reacted like hicks at a hoochie-koochie show. McConnell has, after all, had his problems with the Tea Party wing, and halting the flow of judicial nominees could attract favorable notices and enhance his stature within the party.\n\nThe problem, of course, is there is no way he can keep his word. Several Senate Republicans, including both GOP lawmakers from Alabama, are working with the administration to firm up nominees for open slots. Ultimately more Obama nominees will be confirmed, giving the far right yet another opportunity to proclaim he caved into the liberals, thus confirming their virulent feelings toward him.\n\nIt\u2019s possible he misspoke, although McConnell throughout his public life has been assiduous in his comments. If that were the case, why wouldn\u2019t he just say so instead of denying he made the remarks in the first place?\n\nThe most reasonable explanation is he just can\u2019t withstand the urge to poke Obama with a stick, asserting his feelings of superiority and letting the president know that he, Addison Mitchell McConnell, is going to use judicial nominations to bully him.\n\nMcConnell has, after all, come in second best in most of his confrontations with Obama. The Affordable Care Act is on the books. Taxes were raised on those making in excess of $250,000. Steps were taken to address the Great Recession \u2013 to McConnell\u2019s dismay \u2013 and the economy finally seems to be evening out.\n\nThat undoubtedly wears on McConnell, the master strategist, who continues to view Obama as a greenhorn who can\u2019t, or at least shouldn\u2019t, get the better of him.\n\nIn many ways McConnell is like Aron Nimzowitsch, a chess grandmaster of the 1920s and \u201930s who found himself on the short end of a match with Friedrich Saemisch, who he considered an inferior player. As the game neared its conclusion Nimzowitsch stood on the table and screamed for all to hear, \u201cWhy must I lose to this idiot?\u2019\u2019\n\nMcConnell wonders the same thing.\n\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\n\nWashington correspondent Bill Straub served 11 years as the Frankfort Bureau chief for The Kentucky Post.
