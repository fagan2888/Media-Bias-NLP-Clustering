Or is this just more Trumpian bluster and hyperbole coming out of the Trump camp?\n\nAs a cautious internist who would never make a statement like that about one of my patients, I vote strongly for the latter. Don\u2019t get me wrong \u2026 I certainly believe that Trump\u2019s blood pressure is a healthy 110/65, whether from the benefit of medication or through genetics, and I also believe he has lost at least 15 pounds over the past year, as his physician maintains. Further, the fact that Trump doesn\u2019t smoke or drink is very healthy and something we should all try to emulate. I also don\u2019t believe that age is as much of a factor these days. Trump, 69, is not too old to run for president.\n\nMeanwhile, the other candidates\u2019 health issues are also, for the most part, not a mystery. On the Republican side, Chris Christie underwent lap-band surgery in 2013, is continuing to lose weight and has been declared fit by his doctor.\n\nHe is clearly not the healthiest candidate ever to run, though he is much healthier than Franklin D. Roosevelt in his final term or William Henry Harrison, who died of pneumonia soon after being inaugurated.\n\nJeb Bush\u2019s physician has recently published a letter revealing fluctuating blood pressure that is being successfully treated with diet, exercise and weight loss.\n\nCarly Fiorina is a breast cancer survivor who underwent a double mastectomy in 2009 and is reportedly doing quite well. Ben Carson had successful surgery for prostate cancer in 2002.\n\n2016 Election Headquarters The latest headlines on the 2016 elections from the biggest name in politics. See Latest Coverage \u2192\n\nOver on the Democratic side, the most attention has been paid to Hillary Clinton\u2019s health. She fell and had a concussion in 2012 and developed a blood clot on the brain known as a transverse sinus thrombosis, requiring lifetime blood thinners. She also had a blood clot in her leg several years prior. But as far as we know now, she has had no recurrences of blood clots, no strokes and is fit to run for president \u2013 though she, too, would hardly be the \u201chealthiest individual ever elected to the presidency.\u201d\n\nI remember back in 2008 when the news media tried to make John McCain\u2019s age an issue and I joined Carl Cameron in Phoenix to pore through thousands of pages of the candidate\u2019s medical records. We found no evidence of melanoma recurrence or any reason to believe that his age would be a factor in the election (he was 72 at the time).\n\nAs far as exercise is concerned, Trump\u2019s approach is shortsighted and unwise. Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama exercised regularly in the White House, and all believe it is important for a president, though none more so than Bush. When he hurt his knees after his first term, he turned to mountain biking, and he would ride regularly with his \u201cmountain biking Cabinet.\u201d\n\nHe told me that exercise helped him deal with the stress of being president. \u201cDuring my presidency, exercise meant a lot, whether it was upstairs in the White House on an elliptical machine or outside riding my mountain bike,\u201d he said.\n\nIn the past, Trump has indicated that he eats whatever he wants, and that he takes a cholesterol-lowering statin drug. Dr. Craig Smith, the surgeon who performed President Clinton\u2019s cardiac bypass surgery in 2004, told me that Clinton had eaten a lot of junk food during his presidency and had not been fully compliant with his cholesterol-lowering statin. And there was a price to pay. Smith told me that five of Clinton\u2019s arteries were clogged, leading to an extensive \u2013 and successful \u2013 CABG surgery. Bush, too, expressed a liking of the White House pastry chef\u2019s work and ended up with high cholesterol and a successful cardiac stent in 2013.\n\nThere is no convincing reason to believe that Trump, no matter how active he is or how low his blood pressure is or how well controlled his cholesterol is, will do better medically than Clinton or Bush if he\u2019s elected president. In fact, regular exercise and a well balanced diet have proven health benefits, including a significantly decreased risk of death.\n\nAt least Trump isn\u2019t a former smoker, like President Obama. And I\u2019m sure that, though he\u2019s older, Trump would declare he's in much better health than the president, both physically and mentally.\n\n\n\nDr. Marc Siegel, a practicing internist, joined FOX News Channel (FNC) as a contributor in 2008..", "article_metadata": {"classification": "/FOX NEWS/POLITICS/ELECTIONS/Campaigning", "dcterms.modified": "2015-12-18 03:51:42 EST", "dcterms.abstract": "There is no convincing reason to believe that Donald Trump will do better medically than Clinton or Bush if he\u2019s elected president.", "twitter": {"description": "There is no convincing reason to believe that Donald Trump will do better medically than Clinton or Bush if he\u2019s elected president.", "creator": "@foxnews", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/12/18/physicians-take-on-trumps-health-hyperbole.html", "image": "http://a57.foxnews.com/media2.foxnews.com/2015/12/16/0/0/121615_Buzz_trump_1280.jpg?ve=1", "title": "A physician's take on Trump's health hyperbole", "site": "@foxnews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "dc.format": "text/html", "dc.publisher": "Fox News", "parsely-metadata": "{\"tags\":[\"/FOX NEWS/POLITICS/ELECTIONS/Campaigning\"],\"author\":\"Marc Siegel\",\"subSection\":\"opinion\",\"title\":\"A physician\\\\u0027s take on Trump\\\\u0027s health hyperbole\",\"image_url\":\"http://a57.foxnews.com/media2.foxnews.com/2015/12/16/0/0/121615_Buzz_trump_1280.jpg?ve=1\",\"pub_date\":\"2015-12-18T20:48:00Z\",\"link\":\"http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/12/18/physicians-take-on-trumps-health-hyperbole.html\",\"type\":\"article\",\"identifier\":\"5683b84c-b878-48fc-96ae-1840069435ba\",\"section\":\"opinion\"}", "prism.aggregationType": "subsection", "prism.channel": "fnc", "dc.description": "There is no convincing reason to believe that Donald Trump will do better medically than Clinton or Bush if he\u2019s elected president.", "dc.identifier": "5683b84c-b878-48fc-96ae-1840069435ba", "dc.language": "en-US", "pagetype": "article", "classification-isa": "campaigning", "description": "There is no convincing reason to believe that Donald Trump will do better medically than Clinton or Bush if he\u2019s elected president.", "prism.section": "opinion", "fb": {"app_id": 113186182048399}, "dc.source": "FoxNews.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "dc.title": "A Physician's Take On Trump's Health Hyperbole", "dcterms.created": "2015-12-18 03:51:42 EST", "og": {"site_name": "Fox News", "description": "There is no convincing reason to believe that Donald Trump will do better medically than Clinton or Bush if he\u2019s elected president.", "title": "A physician's take on Trump's health hyperbole | Fox News", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/12/18/physicians-take-on-trumps-health-hyperbole.html", "image": "http://a57.foxnews.com/media2.foxnews.com/2015/12/16/0/0/121615_Buzz_trump_1280.jpg?ve=1", "type": "article"}, "dc.type": "Text.Article", "dc.date": "2015-12-18", "parsely-page": "{\"tags\":[\"/FOX NEWS/POLITICS/ELECTIONS/Campaigning\"],\"author\":\"Marc Siegel\",\"subSection\":\"opinion\",\"title\":\"A physician\\\\u0027s take on Trump\\\\u0027s health hyperbole\",\"image_url\":\"http://a57.foxnews.com/media2.foxnews.com/2015/12/16/0/0/121615_Buzz_trump_1280.jpg?ve=1\",\"pub_date\":\"2015-12-18T20:48:00Z\",\"link\":\"http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/12/18/physicians-take-on-trumps-health-hyperbole.html\",\"post_id\":\"5683b84c-b878-48fc-96ae-1840069435ba\",\"type\":\"article\",\"section\":\"opinion\"}", "dc.creator": "Marc Siegel"}, "article_summary": "In fact, regular exercise and a well balanced diet have proven health benefits, including a significantly decreased risk of death.\nAnd I\u2019m sure that, though he\u2019s older, Trump would declare he's in much better health than the president, both physically and mentally.\nSee Latest Coverage \u2192Over on the Democratic side, the most attention has been paid to Hillary Clinton\u2019s health.\nOr is this just more Trumpian bluster and hyperbole coming out of the Trump camp?\nMeanwhile, the other candidates\u2019 health issues are also, for the most part, not a mystery."}
