The action thus far involves national for-profit firms, like the proposed acquisitions of Cigna by Anthem and Humana by Aetna.\n\nAlmost nothing excites Wall Street like the intrigue of M&A, and merger proponents are promising lower costs, better quality, and higher stock prices. But if history is any guide, mergers in the insurance industry should give consumers (indeed, all purchasers of insurance) cause for concern.\n\nWill a smaller number of larger health insurers better provide what consumers really want \u2014 affordable insurance that meets their health needs? Before addressing that question directly, let\u2019s start with some basic premises:\n\nConsumers need an ample choice of innovative, well-priced insurance products.\n\nIf mergers do generate cost reductions, consumers ought to benefit in the form of some combination of lower premiums, better service, or more-generous plans.\n\nAchieving higher-quality care requires more collaboration across the many practitioners and facilities that deliver it.\n\nWith that context, we can explore how insurers expect to lower costs and improve quality by merging. (I don\u2019t name actual mergers because my analysis relies on broadly applicable principles that will persist long after the latest deals are blocked, closed, or abandoned.)\n\nAim 1: Lower Costs\n\nConsider two main buckets of cost: Administrative expenses (about 10% of the pie) and medical spending (roughly 80% to 90%).\n\nAdministrative expenses are what most merging companies emphasize. The pitch goes something like this: \u201cSynergies will reduce overhead by eliminating duplicative management positions and spreading IT and marketing costs across more members.\u201d Merging firms rarely reveal how they\u2019ll achieve such savings (and certainly avoid mentioning potential layoffs). Furthermore, I know of no public analyses that document savings realized from prior large mergers. The savings might occur \u2014 but they might not. To respond to stakeholders who wonder about the value of these transactions, insurers should provide evidence that mergers of similar scale have achieved the desired administrative cost reductions \u2014 and should commit to a plan for achieving the projected savings. Their analyses should explicitly identify the net costs associated with realizing the anticipated synergies. After all, consulting fees and transition costs add up.\n\nInsight Center Measuring Costs and Outcomes in Healthcare Sponsored by Medtronic A collaboration of the editors of Harvard Business Review and the New England Journal of Medicine, exploring cutting-edge ways to improve quality and reduce waste.\n\nWith regard to the much larger cost bucket \u2014 medical spending \u2014 insurers point to their bargaining clout: \u201cLike Walmart, we will negotiate better prices from providers because our merged entity will represent a larger share of providers\u2019 business.\u201d Some evidence suggests that larger insurers pay providers less. But while Walmart uses its purchasing power to reduce prices to consumers, there is no evidence that savings from health-plan mergers are passed through to consumers in the form of lower premiums.\n\nAim 2: Raise Quality\n\nWith respect to quality, the promise about prospective mergers is best summarized like this: \u201cWith our bigger share of the local patient market, across all customer segments, we can convince providers to invest in our new chronic-disease-management programs and novel payment schemes that reward quality and reduce unnecessary spending. And we\u2019ll have an incentive to pursue those approaches because we\u2019ll reap enough of the rewards.\u201d\n\nFor 25 years, the jury has been out on whether disease-management programs from national payers can improve quality and achieve real savings. The best examples of payer-driven quality improvements come from nonprofit regional payers, such as the Alternative Quality Contract (AQC) implemented by Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts. Researchers found spillover benefits of the AQC for non-BCBS enrollees. That might sound good, but when any one insurer invests in reforming the practice of medicine, providers start making those changes across the board \u2014 and not just for that insurer\u2019s enrollees. The result: the insurer\u2019s rivals also benefit. If an insurer is large enough to reap more of the reward for its own efforts, the argument goes, it should be more likely to innovate. This is an intriguing idea but, so far, only a theoretical one.\n\nThe bit of evidence we have on how competition affects the quality of health plans comes from the Medicare HMO program. A 2003 study of the program found that, all other factors being equal, the more rivals in a geographic area, the greater the availability of prescription drug benefits. (That was before enactment of Medicare Part D, which funded drug benefits for nearly all Medicare enrollees.)\n\nWill the Past Be Prologue?\n\nMy research colleagues and I have found that having fewer insurers leads to higher premiums, both for the large employer segment and the individual exchange market. In short, premiums actually go up, not down, when insurance markets become more concentrated. Other researchers report similar conclusions with respect to Medicare HMO premiums.\n\nIndeed, I\u2019m aware of no peer-reviewed, published analyses that show that insurance mergers, on average, benefit consumers. But has the landscape changed since the Affordable Care Act was passed?\n\nSome observers argue that potential premium increases related to mergers are limited by the ACA\u2019s \u201cminimum loss ratio\u201d regulation, which requires that insurers spend at least 80 cents of each premium dollar on medical expenses (the cutoff is 85 cents for large group insurance). But what counts as a medical expense is a gray area. And does anyone doubt that a stronger, more concentrated insurance industry wouldn\u2019t try to repeal this ACA provision? Competition may be more reliable than regulation when it comes to constraining pricing in this private market.\n\nWhat about providers \u2014 the hospitals, physicians, and myriad facilities that actually produce medical services? They may benefit from the simplicity of dealing with fewer insurers, but they also have less bargaining clout. The American Hospital Association and the American Medical Association have already expressed their displeasure with some of the proposed mergers.\n\nShould consumers care about disgruntled providers? Under certain circumstances they should, specifically in regions where a more concentrated insurance sector can cause providers to reduce the supply or the quality of \u201cnecessary\u201d services.\n\nClearly, we need additional systematic research to address the many unanswered questions about whether and where consolidation might harm or help consumers. But the evidence to date points to a real potential risk for higher premiums \u2014 with no evidence of commensurate improvements in quality. Discriminating consumers need more facts to be convinced that payers\u2019 promises are more than sweet talk.\n\nNote: On September 22, 2015, Leemore Dafny testified on the subject of insurance consolidation before the U.S. Senate Judiciary subcommittee on Antitrust, Competition Policy, and Consumer Rights.", "article_metadata": {"page-category-id": 1344, "msapplication-config": "none", "description": "Consolidations don\u2019t always deliver on their potential.", "page-category-name": "Mergers & acquisitions", "og": {"site_name": "Harvard Business Review", "description": "Consolidations don\u2019t always deliver on their potential.", "title": "The Risks of Health Insurance Company Mergers", "url": "https://hbr.org/2015/09/the-risks-of-health-insurance-company-mergers", "image": "https://hbr.org/resources/images/hbr_opengraph_940x490.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2015/09/SEPT15_24_88392665_horz.jpg", "site": "@harvardbiz", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@harvardbiz"}, "ox-group": 537063787, "item-name": "The Risks of Health Insurance Company Mergers", "intromercial": "protected", "page-id": 300, "article-content-type": "Digital Article", "rr-placements": "item_page.articles,item_page.top_right,item_page.bottom,item_page.red_strip,item_page.subscribe_now,item_page.topbar_subscribe,item_page.mag_cover,item_page.subscribe,item_page.article_slider,item_page.exit_popup_slider", "viewport": "initial-scale=1,width=device-width", "shopper-attributes": "state:guest", "sid": "5BA2E1C98E8071244DFF662E63C642B6", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/HBR", "published_time": "2015-09-24T15:00:44Z", "author": "Leemore Dafny", "section": "Mergers & acquisitions", "modified_time": "2015-09-24T15:00:44Z", "tag": "Mergers & acquisitions"}, "page-type": "ITEM", "primary-editor": 36, "item-id": "tag:blogs.harvardbusiness.org,2007-03-31:999.109534", "uid": "527d2b4fa438ab244bb69328467d1228"}, "article_summary": "But if history is any guide, mergers in the insurance industry should give consumers (indeed, all purchasers of insurance) cause for concern.\nWill a smaller number of larger health insurers better provide what consumers really want \u2014 affordable insurance that meets their health needs?\nIndeed, I\u2019m aware of no peer-reviewed, published analyses that show that insurance mergers, on average, benefit consumers.\nBefore addressing that question directly, let\u2019s start with some basic premises:Consumers need an ample choice of innovative, well-priced insurance products.\nIf mergers do generate cost reductions, consumers ought to benefit in the form of some combination of lower premiums, better service, or more-generous plans."}
