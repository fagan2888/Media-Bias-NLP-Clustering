Nepal was crippled by last month\u2019s magnitude-7.8 earthquake, which killed more than 8,000, while a string of strong aftershocks has further terrified the survivors. The capital of Kathmandu is in shambles. Entire villages are flattened into rubble and dust. And many businesses have shut down, leaving survivors scrambling for income.\n\nThe brick factories clustered in Bhaktapur, a town on the outskirts of Kathmandu, are some of the few businesses still running. For the owners and workers who have not fled back to their villages, that means there is still a chance of earning daily wages and profits.\n\n\u201cI am making my contribution in the rebuilding our country by making these bricks,\u201d said 17-year-old Barsa Pun Magar, who joined the factory six months ago.\n\n\u201cThere has been so much destruction,\u201d she said. \u201cEvery brick is going to help bring the country and people back on their feet.\u201d\n\nThough many of the factories have also been damaged, with kiln towers toppled and workers\u2019 housing destroyed, those who remain are laboring overtime before the anticipated rush for construction materials. In a few weeks, monsoon will arrive and create impassable mud swamps, trigger landslides and pummel the tarpaulin tents providing shelter to many across the country.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Brick business booms as Nepal readies to rebuild after quake", "title": "Brick business booms as Nepal readies to rebuild after quake", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Brick business booms as Nepal readies to rebuild after quake", "title": "Brick business booms as Nepal readies to rebuild after quake", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/05/16/brick_business_booms_as_nepal_readies_to_rebuild_after_quake/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/05/nepal-earthquake-brick-boom.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Brick business booms as Nepal readies to rebuild after quake", "title": "Brick business booms as Nepal readies to rebuild after quake", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/05/nepal-earthquake-brick-boom.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Binaj Gurubacharya", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc514\"", "article_summary": "And many businesses have shut down, leaving survivors scrambling for income.\nThe brick factories clustered in Bhaktapur, a town on the outskirts of Kathmandu, are some of the few businesses still running.\nNepal was crippled by last month\u2019s magnitude-7.8 earthquake, which killed more than 8,000, while a string of strong aftershocks has further terrified the survivors.\n\u201cI am making my contribution in the rebuilding our country by making these bricks,\u201d said 17-year-old Barsa Pun Magar, who joined the factory six months ago.\nIn a few weeks, monsoon will arrive and create impassable mud swamps, trigger landslides and pummel the tarpaulin tents providing shelter to many across the country."}
