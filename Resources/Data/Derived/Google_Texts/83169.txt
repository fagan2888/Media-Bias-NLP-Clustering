Two men are behind bars in Okaloosa for drug possession. Walton County deputies arrested 25 year old James David Martin Sanders from Miramar Beach and 25 year old Samuel St. Clair Serrato from Santa Rosa Beach this week.

Deputies found two pounds of marijuana, candy containing hashish, several glass-smoking devices, cut plastic straws, bagged-cocaine, and $14,000.

Sanders and Serrato are charged with selling marijuana. Sanders is also charged with cocaine and narcotic equipment possession.

Both were booked into the Walton County jail.
