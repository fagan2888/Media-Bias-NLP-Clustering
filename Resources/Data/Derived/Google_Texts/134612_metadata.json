Joni Ernst, who is a lieutenant colonel in the Iowa Army National Guard, sits on a supporter\u2019s motorcycle after an Iowa Federation of Republican Women breakfast in Hiawatha, Iowa.\n\nOct. 18, 2014 In front of her campaign bus, Iowa state Sen. Joni Ernst, who is a lieutenant colonel in the Iowa Army National Guard, sits on a supporter\u2019s motorcycle after an Iowa Federation of Republican Women breakfast in Hiawatha, Iowa. Melina Mara/The Washington Post\n\nAt campaign stops in the state, she is considered a rising star in a thin field.\n\nAt campaign stops throughout the state, she is considered a rising star in a thin field.\n\nAt campaign stops throughout the state, she is considered a rising star in a thin field.\n\nJoni Ernst, U.S. Senate candidate, has a banana, a cup of coffee, and a 31-foot RV painted with American flags, landscapes of corn, and hogs.\n\nShe also has Iowa stretching vastly out in front of her. Seven counties today, eight counties yesterday, 99 counties in 44 days, and a tour she\u2019s calling \u201cIowa Knows Best\u201d that is intended to persuade Iowans to send her to Washington so she can show the federal government a better way: \u201cthe Iowa way.\u201d The Iowa way is fiscal responsibility, she has been telling the people on this tour. The Iowa way is cutting taxes and balancing budgets. \u201cThe Iowa way is working,\u201d she says at most stops \u2014 it\u2019s the rest of the country that\u2019s broken.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s take a look here,\u201d Ernst says, boarding the RV, setting her breakfast on the table and scanning the morning\u2019s itinerary. First stop: Linn County, and the Iowa Federation of Republican Women.\n\n\u201cReady?\u201d asks the campaign staffer who does the driving.\n\nErnst, 44, the biscuit-baking, gun-shooting, twangy, twinkly farm girl and mother whose ads emphasize her knowledge of hog castration (\u201cMake \u2019em squeal, Joni!\u201d yell her fans) puts down the itinerary and nods. Ready, she tells the driver \u2014 and a tour she feels will help determine not only an election but also the soul of Iowa is rolling again.\n\nView Graphic Election Lab: See our current forecast for every congressional race in 2014\n\nA year ago she was nobody, a small-town Republican state senator with a vision of filling a U.S. Senate seat that had, for 30 years, belonged to a liberal Democrat. Now, she is seen nationally as a rising star in a field of duds \u2014 if she can pull off an upset in a race few expected her, or any Republican, to win. With a little more than a week before the election, she maintained a slim lead in the polls in one of the country\u2019s closest \u00adraces, within hoping distance of becoming the state\u2019s first female senator and ahead of the expected Democratic shoo-in, Rep. Bruce Braley. The White House had sent out Michelle Obama to campaign for Braley a week before and, Ernst loves to tell people, the first lady mispronounced his name.\n\nThe RV pulls up to Linn County\u2019s Victory Office, where the Federation of Republican Women is having breakfast. Almost immediately, Ernst falls into a hug with a white-haired fan.\n\n\u201cOh, Joni!\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, Norma!\u201d\n\nNorma and her husband have been to see Ernst at several previous rallies.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so proud of you,\u201d Norma says. \u201cYou\u2019ve worked so hard!\u201d\n\nErnst looks into her eyes and nods. \u201cWe\u2019re gonna do this.\u201d\n\nIowa state senator Joni Ernst cruised to victory last night and pledged to take her \"pork cutting\" skills all the way to Washington. (Jackie Kucinich/The Washington Post)\n\n\u201cOh, Joni!\u201d\n\nInside the meet-and-greet, Ernst takes the floor and talks about the ways of Iowa.\n\n\u201cI can tell you that the Iowa way \u2013 the Iowa way is to find out that there is a problem and acknowledge it and address it head-on,\u201d she says, scolding Democrats for blaming fiscal problems on the George W. Bush administration.\n\n\u201cWe are putting more of our friends and family to work,\u201d she says, as the audience punctuates the speech with cheers. \u201cIt\u2019s those Iowa values. The Iowa way.\n\n\u201cI do believe in the Iowa way. Iowans helping Iowans. Iowans finding solutions for problems.\n\n\u201cGod bless you. God bless Iowa. God bless America.\u201d\n\n\u2018Everyone loves Iowa\u2019\n\n\u201cWell, let\u2019s just start off,\u201d the radio interviewer says to Ernst. He\u2019s standing in her RV, which is parked in front of a Monroe County steakhouse. \u201cHow about you tell us a little bit about yourself, who you are, and what you\u2019re all about?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou bet,\u201d Ernst says into the microphone. \u201cI grew up in southwest Iowa, on a farm north of Stanton, Iowa, which is a tiny little town, a farming community. I went to Iowa State University and joined Army ROTC while I was there, and just have had such a phenomenal life. I am a veteran of Operation Iraqi Freedom.\u201d\n\nThe interviewer nods as Ernst talks about her passion for civil service and her desire to help Iowa.\n\n\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d he says. \u201cEveryone loves Iowa.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cIowa way\u201d is something that makes sense to Ernst\u2019s supporters on this tour. Especially this leg of it, which goes through some of the state\u2019s most rural parts: past farmhouses, grain elevators, crop dusters, and to places that value thrift, self-reliance, lack of pretension.\n\nIn Ida County: \u201cI got my Obama bailout,\u201d one farmer says to his seatmate in the Ida Grove Recreation Center. He spells it: \u201cB-A-L-E. Like a hay bale?\u201d He\u2019s got his bale out in his yard.\n\nIn Harrison County: \u201cI just finished my bean harvest,\u201d another farmer tells another seatmate at another recreation center. \u201cGood bean crop.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, it was good? What do you think they\u2019re making?\u201d\n\n\u201cAbout sixty-three?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a good bean.\u201d\n\nAt that stop, Deborah Nelson, a convenience store owner, approaches Ernst with a written list of topics on which she wants clarification: Abortion. Immigration. Obamacare. The Farm Bill.\n\nErnst tells Nelson that she is antiabortion. That she would work to replace Obama\u2019s health-care program. That she will always, always support the military \u2014 Ernst herself served in Kuwait in 2003, and she\u2019s still a lieutenant colonel in the National Guard.\n\n\u201cI just wake up every day and I\u2019m scared,\u201d Nelson says as Ernst moves on to talk to other supporters. This race seems so important, Nelson says, and the gulf between Ernst and Bruce Braley seems so wide. Both candidates have traversed the state, but supporters on Ernst\u2019s tour point out that this weekend, while Joni is out here with them, Braley is in more liberal Iowa City with Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass). \u201cI think Joni has the principles that Iowa has,\u201d Nelson says. At least the western part, she says. \u201cThis part.\u201d\n\nThe other part of Iowa is the city part, Nelson says. It\u2019s the part that made Iowa the first Midwestern state to legalize same-sex marriage, and the part that lobbies for environmental regulations, and the part that Braley seems to be speaking to. The conservative positions that are important to Nelson are the same ones that make Ernst a polarizing candidate to other voters. She proposed dismantling the Environmental Protection Agency and the Education Department. She supported a \u201cpersonhood\u201d amendment to give legal rights to fetuses from the time of fertilization \u2014 though she later tried to back away from it.\n\nThese differences between the candidates represent the fight for Iowa\u2019s future that Ernst talks about at each stop.\n\nIn Cherokee County: At an old train depot decorated with patriotic bunting, Ernst tells the audience, \u201cThe Iowa way is to acknowledge you have a problem and address it. Let\u2019s stop pointing the finger and let\u2019s start making things happen.\u201d\n\nAfterward, Cherokee residents line up to shake Ernst\u2019s hand, and while they wait, they eat cinnamon rolls from a folding table until there is only one roll left. It\u2019s the one the mayor dropped on the floor. Then somebody decides it wasn\u2019t on the floor for long, and that waste is a terrible thing, and eats it.\n\n\u201cThe Iowa way?\u201d Jana Fuller, who has lived elsewhere in the Midwest but likes Iowa best, pauses near the rolls to think about what that means. \u201cIf we\u2019re different at all, it\u2019s that we\u2019re earthy. We\u2019re people of the land. Sometimes we\u2019re laughed at because we\u2019re a flyover state, or whatever, but so many people here are intelligent and kind, and everything you\u2019d want to be.\u201d\n\nReturning to \u2018the right track\u2019\n\n\u201cHow long do you think you spoke in there?\u201d asks Gretchen Hamel, Ernst\u2019s communications director. They\u2019re on the RV, in between counties. Ernst, in a pink cardigan and khakis, sits at the table.\n\n\u201cTen minutes?\u201d Ernst guesses.\n\n\u201cNo. Fifteen.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo!\u201d\n\n\u201cHow long are you going to be next time?\u201d\n\n\u201cFive to six,\u201d Ernst promises.\n\nShe never means to talk that long. It\u2019s just that she gets swept up in the moment. She\u2019s a hugger. Hugs everybody. Likes taking pictures. Can\u2019t resist hopping onto someone\u2019s motorcycle for a photo, even when her staff is telling her they really, really need to go.\n\nErnst says she sometimes feels like she has the weight of the world on her shoulders. \u201cWe need to win in Iowa if we want to get America back on what I consider the right track,\u201d she says in an interview. \u201cWe have to do this, and there\u2019s no ifs, ands or buts.\u201d\n\nNow, in the RV, is when she usually might check in with her family \u2014 her husband and teenage daughter back home in Red Oak. Today a campaign staffer asks a favor. His friend\u2019s daughter has to do a travel project, where people from around the country fill in information about themselves and their states. The staffer wonders if Joni could do a page. She takes the folder.\n\n\u201cWhat are your hobbies?\u201d she reads out loud. \u201cCampaigning. Campaigning is my latest hobby.\u201d\n\n\u201cHugging,\u201d a staffer offers.\n\n\u201cHugging.\u201d\n\nThe RV rolls on. \u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d Hamel asks as they approach the next stop.\n\n\u201cFive to six minutes.\u201d\n\nOne hour, sixty miles, and one stop later, Ernst\u2019s supporters in Wapello County sit in metal chairs in the county\u2019s GOP headquarters, waiting for the candidate to arrive.\n\n\u201cShe probably won\u2019t be here but 15 minutes,\u201d one attendee warns another. \u201cThey can\u2019t ever stay for long; they got so many places to be.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re waiting on the perfect candidate, Jesus Christ ain\u2019t running,\u201d another attendee, a middle-aged man, says.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I tell people,\u201d replies Linda Clark, a retired cosmetologist who came with her year-old granddaughter.\n\n\u201cBut Joni\u2019s close, though,\u201d the man says.\n\n\u201cOh, she\u2019s wonderful.\u201d Clark has been a fan for months. She loves the small-government philosophy that Ernst stands for, and she thinks its great that Ernst would be Iowa\u2019s first female senator. Some people have tried to warn her that Ernst\u2019s position on health care could make it more expensive for women to get birth control, but that doesn\u2019t bother Clark. \u201cI always bought my own birth control anyway,\u201d she says.\n\nFinally, Ernst arrives, waving to the waiting group, stooping to greet Clark\u2019s granddaughter.\n\n\u201cCan you say Joni?\u201d Clark prompts the toddler. \u201cJo-ni?\u201d\n\nHelping neighbors\n\nThe RV again. It\u2019s late in the day, and the sky is turning pink and orange as Ernst and her staff travel to their final stop of the evening, a chili cook-off in Decatur County. Pop music drifts back from the front seats.\n\nErnst is asked to explain, again, the Iowa way.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard work,\u201d she begins. \u201cIt\u2019s personal responsibility.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s the fact that, she says, when floods came to Iowa, emergency shelters were unnecessary because people took in their neighbors themselves.\n\nYears ago, back when she was running for county auditor, there was this man who was a supporter of hers, a farmer and rancher, and a cow knocked against him so hard and so unexpectedly that he had a heart attack and was rushed to the hospital, she says.\n\n\u201cIt was during harvest. They put a message out on the radio station, and he had more people come out on their tractors and combines to bring his harvest in so that his wife and his children wouldn\u2019t have to worry about it. So they could focus on their dad. The community said, \u2018Don\u2019t worry about it. We got it.\u2019 \u201d\n\nShe breaks off. She is crying now, silently, as she remembers this farmer. When she starts to talk again after pausing to wipe her eyes with a clump of tissues, her voice is wobbly.\n\n\u201cAnd he ended up dying. And he was such a great man. But they didn\u2019t want his wife to worry about it. And that\u2019s what it is. It\u2019s just about taking care of people that you love.\u201d\n\nShe nods. The RV keeps moving.\n\nShe talks about a few other things: her military career, college years spent volunteering at a women\u2019s shelter. Then the driver calls back that they\u2019re only a few minutes away from the cook-off.\n\n\u201cTime to get dolled up again,\u201d she says, applying a coat of lipstick.\n\nInside the building holding the cook-off, crockpots of chili line the perimeter of a linoleum-floored room. Women set out Tupperware holding brownies and marshmallow squares at one end of the table, and a man lays out Styrofoam bowls at another. A teenage girl and boy sing \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner\u201d in a pure, tremulous and slightly flat key, and people put their hands on their hearts and sing along.\n\n\u201cOur Iowa way is the right approach,\u201d Ernst tells the crowd. The people organizing the chili table stop, cutlery in hands, to listen to her. A mother hushes her child, and an older couple murmurs agreement. Yes, they nod. Yes.\n\n\u201cGod bless you,\u201d Ernst says, and the applause begins. \u201cGod bless the great state of Iowa. God bless the great United States of America.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Republican is mounting a strong challenge for the Senate seat long held by liberal Tom Harkin.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/monica.hesse.7", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "The Republican is mounting a strong challenge for the Senate seat long held by liberal Tom Harkin.", "title": "Joni Ernst, trumpeting \u2018the Iowa way,\u2019 shakes up her state", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/joni-ernst-trumpeting-the-iowa-way-shakes-up-her-statejoni-earnst/2014/10/26/8387b208-592d-11e4-bd61-346aee66ba29_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2014/10/24/Others/Images/2014-10-23/__%20i%20211414118831.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@MonicaHesse"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/joni-ernst-trumpeting-the-iowa-way-shakes-up-her-statejoni-earnst/2014/10/26/8387b208-592d-11e4-bd61-346aee66ba29_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "Joni Ernst, bruce braley, iowa senate campaign, midterm elections, iowa sentate, ernst braley, make em squeal, gop senate, who will win the senate, novermber elections, senate elections, election day, the iowa way", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/monica.hesse.7"}, "eomportal-uuid": "8387b208-592d-11e4-bd61-346aee66ba29", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "Joni Ernst, bruce braley, iowa senate campaign, midterm elections, iowa sentate, ernst braley, make em squeal, gop senate, who will win the senate, novermber elections, senate elections, election day, the iowa way"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd956a\"", "article_summary": "\u201cI can tell you that the Iowa way \u2013 the Iowa way is to find out that there is a problem and acknowledge it and address it head-on,\u201d she says, scolding Democrats for blaming fiscal problems on the George W.
