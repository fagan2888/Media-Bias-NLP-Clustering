Such a move could have the immediate effect of requiring insurers to cover qualifying enrollees without receiving the full subsidy to cover their increased costs, Jacobs writes.\n\nAlready, House Republicans have been pressing the Obama administration about cost-sharing reductions. This week, House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Fred Upton (R-Mich.) and House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady (R-Texas) filed more subpoenas for documents regarding the cost-sharing reduction program, the lawmakers announced. The committee leaders say the administration's method of funding the subsidies--which have totaled more than $5 billion and are estimated to amount to approximately $170 billion over the next 10 years--is unconstitutional.\n\nThe Obama administration has responded by saying that a separate program subsidizing health insurance premiums gives it the necessary authority to spend funds on the cost-sharing subsidies, Jacobs notes.\n\nInsurers are now weighing all these factors, especially with the 2016 election drawing closer, as they submit their premium rate requests for 2017. Already, some are seeking large premium increases, FierceHealthPayer has reported.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- read the WSJ article\n\n- here is the lawmakers' announcement\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nLawmakers subpoena IRS, Treasury over ACA payments\n\nHouse Republicans press HHS about Affordable Care Act funding\n\nHouse GOP lawsuit: ACA payment transfers violate separation of powers\n\nHouse GOP files lawsuit, attacks Obama's hand in ACA implementation", "article_metadata": {"description": "Insurers that offer plans in the Affordable Care Act marketplaces must consider what will happen to cost-sharing subsidies if a Republican is elected president, according to an\u00a0analysis\u00a0published by\u00a0the\u00a0Wall Street Journal.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthPayer", "description": "Insurers that offer plans in the Affordable Care Act marketplaces must consider what will happen to cost-sharing subsidies if a Republican is elected president, according to an\u00a0analysis\u00a0published by\u00a0the\u00a0Wall Street Journal.", "title": "Republican president could quash cost-sharing subsidies for ACA plans", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthpayer.com/story/republican-president-could-quash-cost-sharing-subsidies-aca-plans/2016-05-06", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthpayer.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "healthpayer", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "keywords": "Care Delivery,Chris Jacobs,Data Analytics,Energy and Commerce Committee,Fred Upton,Health Insurance Exchanges,Kevin Brady,subpoena,subsidies", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Care Delivery,Data Analytics,Health Insurance Exchanges"}, "article_summary": "Already, House Republicans have been pressing the Obama administration about cost-sharing reductions.\nThe Obama administration has responded by saying that a separate program subsidizing health insurance premiums gives it the necessary authority to spend funds on the cost-sharing subsidies, Jacobs notes.\nTo learn more:- read the WSJ article- here is the lawmakers' announcementRelated Articles:Lawmakers subpoena IRS, Treasury over ACA paymentsHouse Republicans press HHS about Affordable Care Act fundingHouse GOP lawsuit: ACA payment transfers violate separation of powersHouse GOP files lawsuit, attacks Obama's hand in ACA implementation\nInsurers that offer plans in the Affordable Care Act marketplaces must consider what will happen to cost-sharing subsidies if a Republican is elected president, according to an analysis published by the Wall Street Journal.\nInsurers are now weighing all these factors, especially with the 2016 election drawing closer, as they submit their premium rate requests for 2017."}
