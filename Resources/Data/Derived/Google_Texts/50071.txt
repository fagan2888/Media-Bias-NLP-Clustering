The Denver-based international nonprofit iDE is hosting a vigil and fundraiser Saturday night to benefit the victims of the Nepal earthquake.

The event is from 6 to 8 p.m. on the first floor of the Posner Center for International Development at 1031 33rd St. in the Curtis Park neighborhood.

It will include a musical prayer, a candlelight vigil and video updates from Nepal.

Donations collected at the event will support iDEâ€™s response and recovery effort, the organization says.

Assistance will include food and plastic sheeting, and working with partners to assess and meet immediate needs and tackle long-term recovery, the group says.

The organization has 86 people on the ground in Nepal, concentrating on bringing aid to rural villages such as Tanke and Ranagaun.

The event will also be attended by the CU Nepalese Student Association.
