What\u2019s happening is that movements in long-term fixed mortgage rates closely follow 10-year Treasury note yields, which have declined as investor demand for high quality debt has jumped.\n\n\u201cRates have fallen recently despite the pretty good economic data for the U.S.,\u201d said Len Kiefer, Freddie\u2019s deputy chief economist. \u201cIf international tensions ease, better economic data should put upward pressure on rates and over the next few months we expect to see rates track higher. But continued troubles abroad could translate to some near term volatility.\u201d\n\nLower rates translate to more affordable mortgages, a trend that could support home buying, especially if the labor market continues to strengthen. And separate data released Thursday signaled that the sales pace of existing homes has indeed picked up in recent months, supported by a variety of factors.\n\nHowever, with home sales trending below year-earlier levels, major housing-market roadblocks remain. In particular, lending standards that experts say are overly restrictive are preventing some seemingly creditworthy borrowers from obtaining home loans. And if borrowers who need financing can\u2019t get a loan, it doesn\u2019t make a difference how cheap mortgages are \u2014 these families won\u2019t buy a home.\n\nLow interest rates have provided less support to the economy than prominent economists had predicted they would. And rates are expected to eventually resume their climb higher as the Federal Reserve cuts quantitative easing and the economy strengthens.\n\n\u2013Ruth Mantell\n\nFollow Ruth on Twitter @RuthMantell\n\nFollow the Capitol Report blog on Twitter @CapitolReport\n\nCheck out these Capitol Report links:\n\nWhy a Republican-controlled Senate might not change much\n\nObamacare acting as drag on employment and lifting prices, survey suggests", "article_metadata": {"article.author": "MarketWatch", "description": "Rising mortgage rates have been taken a bunch of the blame this year for weak home sales, but better times may be ahead as data released Thursday showed that mortgage rates been dropping.", "application-name": "MarketWatch.com", "article.page": "Capitol Report Blog", "og": {"site_name": "Marketwatch", "description": "Rising mortgage rates have been taken a bunch of the blame this year for weak home sales, but better times may be ahead as data released Thursday showed that mortgage rates been dropping.", "title": "Rate for 30-year mortgage down nearly half a point over past 12 months", "url": "http://blogs.marketwatch.com/capitolreport/2014/08/21/rate-for-30-year-mortgage-down-nearly-half-a-point-over-past-12-months/", "image": {"width": 569, "identifier": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/MWimages/MW-CS106_Freddi_MG_20140821123150.jpg", "height": 398}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Marketwatch.com", "description": "Rising mortgage rates have been taken a bunch of the blame this year for weak home sales, but better times may be ahead as data released Thursday showed that mortgage rates been dropping.", "title": "Rate for 30-year mortgage down nearly half a point over past 12 months", "url": "http://blogs.marketwatch.com/capitolreport/2014/08/21/rate-for-30-year-mortgage-down-nearly-half-a-point-over-past-12-months/", "image": {"src": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/MWimages/MW-CS106_Freddi_MG_20140821123150.jpg"}, "site": "MarketWatch", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.published": "2014-08-21T13:13:27-04:00", "article.access": "free", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "msapplication-tooltip": "MarketWatch", "article.type": "Capitol Report", "article.id": "BL-MWEB-6990", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.marketwatch.com/capitolreport/2014/08/21/rate-for-30-year-mortgage-down-nearly-half-a-point-over-past-12-months/", "app_id": 283204329838}, "article.created": "2014-08-21T13:13:27-04:00", "article.updated": "2014-08-21T13:13:27-04:00", "keywords": "housing,mortgage rates", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/marketwatch", "image_count": 2}, "article.section": "Blogs", "article.headline": "Rate for 30-year mortgage down nearly half a point over past 12 months", "msapplication-task": "name=SmartMoney;action-uri=http://www.smartmoney.com/;icon-uri=http://www.smartmoney.com/favicon.ico", "news_keywords": "housing,mortgage rates"}, "article_summary": "What\u2019s happening is that movements in long-term fixed mortgage rates closely follow 10-year Treasury note yields, which have declined as investor demand for high quality debt has jumped.\nRising mortgage rates have been taken a bunch of the blame this year for weak home sales, but better times may be ahead as data released Thursday showed that mortgage rates been dropping.\nRemarkably, the latest rate is down 48 basis points \u2013 almost half a percentage point \u2013 from the year-earlier level.\nThe average rate for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage declined to 4.10% in the week that ended Aug. 21 \u2014 the lowest rate since late October \u2014 from 4.12% in the prior week, federally controlled mortgage-buyer Freddie Mac reported.\n\u201cRates have fallen recently despite the pretty good economic data for the U.S.,\u201d said Len Kiefer, Freddie\u2019s deputy chief economist."}
