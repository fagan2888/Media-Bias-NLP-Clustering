Most of those needing care are elderly; the typical caregiver is a 49-year-old woman caring for her mother.\n\nBut the ratio of potential family caregivers to the growing number of older people is in steep decline. In 2010, there were seven potential caregivers available for each person 80 or older; by 2030 there will be only four, and by 2050, when baby boomers are between 86 and 104, there will be fewer than three \u2014 not enough to provide the kind of care that previous generations have relied on.\n\nGetting politicians to focus on this gap is the first step to finding a solution, advocates say. Aside from Hillary Rodham Clinton, who cared for her own aging mother at home and has called for more support for family caregivers, most presidential candidates have been silent on the topic.\n\nBut others are stepping in.\n\n\n\n\n\nA congressional caucus was formed in March to focus on the needs of family caregivers. This summer, Rep. Michelle Lujan Grisham (D-N.M.) reintroduced a bill to create a national Care Corps program, modeled after the Peace Corps, in which volunteers would help family caregivers. And Rep. Nita M. Lowey (D-N.Y.) introduced legislation that would give caregivers a Social Security earnings credit when they take unpaid time off from their jobs to provide care.\n\nThe bipartisan Recognize, Assist, Include, Support and Engage (RAISE) Family Caregivers Act, introduced in July, would mandate the development of a national strategy to support family caregivers. And AARP\u2019s Caregiver Advise, Record, Enable (CARE) Act would require hospitals to adequately inform and, if necessary, train family members who care for relatives coming out of the hospital. So far, 18 state legislatures have passed it.\n\n\u201cFor the first time, people are saying, \u2018This is something Congress should focus on,\u201d said AARP Executive Vice President Nancy LeaMond.\n\nIt has been a long time coming, advocates say. In 2013, Congress repealed the Community Living Assistance Services and Supports Act, a long-term care insurance component of the Affordable Care Act. And while the federal Commission on Long-Term Care later that year called for national policies to support family caregivers, advocates say there has been little follow-up.\n\nNow, they hope to force the conversation up from the grass-roots level and into the legislative arena. The advocates\u2019 hope is that, similar to what happened with same-sex rights, increasing awareness will eventually spur political action.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re struggling to help our neighbors. We\u2019re struggling to help our grandparents. We\u2019ve been seeing this as a \u2018just our family to deal with\u2019 and not seeing that there are ways from a policy standpoint to make this easier,\u201d said Victoria Walker, national coordinator of the Family Caregiver Platform Project, a coalition of organizations seeking to get caregiving onto individual states\u2019 Democratic and Republican platforms.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to have enough conversations going at these local levels so that next time people hear mention of it, they\u2019ll think, \u2018Oh yeah, we\u2019ve been talking about this for a long time; why haven\u2019t we done anything about it?\u2019 \u201d she said.\n\nDoing something about it can mean offering caregivers help with their duties, giving them tax breaks or providing Social Security credits when they leave work to care for a family member.\n\nThe Platform Project, led by the Center for Elder Care and Advanced Illness, provides a roadmap, model language and timelines for political party activities, as well as suggestions on engaging local politicians. The project is not focused on getting a specific piece of legislation passed but rather on tailoring a platform based on what is most needed.\n\nSo far, organizers are active in 16 states. In states where parties adopt national platforms, they hope to pass resolutions with wording about caregiving.\n\nCaring for a relative exacts a financial toll, both in terms of lost income and additional expenses. Those who care for people with Alzheimer\u2019s disease typically spend more than $50,000 a year on expenses related to their duties.\n\nSeveral countries, including Germany, Italy and Japan, have starker caregiver ratios but more government spending on social support such as meals and transportation. Most industrialized nations spend more on social services than on medical services, but the United States spends significantly more on medical services, according to the health-care journal BMJ Quality & Safety.\n\n\u201cFamily caregiving is having a moment, but there\u2019s a long way to go,\u201d said Lori Simon-Rusinowitz, associate professor of health administration at the University of Maryland. \u201cPeople are realizing if we don\u2019t do something to help family caregivers and they go away, it\u2019s going to cost us so much more.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "In the face of a looming \u201ccaregiver crisis,\u201d advocates call for legislation to help those who help others.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/tarabahrampour", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "In the face of a looming \u201ccaregiver crisis,\u201d advocates call for legislation to help those who help others.", "title": "Why some advocates are trying to push caregiving onto the 2016 presidential agenda", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/social-issues/caregiving-gets-political-as-organizers-push-issue-onto-local-national-agendas/2015/10/20/479fee44-72aa-11e5-8d93-0af317ed58c9_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2015/10/19/SocialIssues-Religion-Immigration/Graphics/caregivers1021.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@TaraBahrampour"}, "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "caregiving, caregiver, caregiver crisis, aarp, family caregiver platform project, caregiving and politics, caregiving and election", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/tarabahrampour"}, "eomportal-uuid": "479fee44-72aa-11e5-8d93-0af317ed58c9", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "caregiving, caregiver, caregiver crisis, aarp, family caregiver platform project, caregiving and politics, caregiving and election"}, "article_summary": "\u201cPeople are realizing if we don\u2019t do something to help family caregivers and they go away, it\u2019s going to cost us so much more.\u201d\nBut the ratio of potential family caregivers to the growing number of older people is in steep decline.\nThe bipartisan Recognize, Assist, Include, Support and Engage (RAISE) Family Caregivers Act, introduced in July, would mandate the development of a national strategy to support family caregivers.\nSeveral countries, including Germany, Italy and Japan, have starker caregiver ratios but more government spending on social support such as meals and transportation.\nA congressional caucus was formed in March to focus on the needs of family caregivers."}
