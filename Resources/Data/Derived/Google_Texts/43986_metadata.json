That \u201cthe nuance you gave now was something (they) couldn\u2019t handle and (you) didn\u2019t trust the American people with the fuller truth?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d the president said.\n\nObama later added: \u201cThere are a bunch of folks up in Congress and others who made this statement and they were entirely sincere about it. And the fact that you\u2019ve got this percentage of people who have had (their insurance canceled), I want them to know that, you know, their senator or congressman, they were making representations based on what I told them and what this White House and our administration told them. So it\u2019s not on them, it\u2019s on us.\u201d\n\nYou can watch the full exchange here:\n\n\u2013\n\nFollow Becket Adams (@BecketAdams) on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30; polling-uri=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/1.xml; polling-uri2=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/2.xml; polling-uri3=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/3.xml; polling-uri4=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/4.xml", "application-name": "TheBlaze.com", "twitter": {"description": "CBS News' Major Garrett wasted no time Thursday hammering President Barack Obama during a press conference over his failed \u201cyou can keep it\u201d health insurance promise.  \u201cYou said while the law was being debated, \u2018If you like your plan, you can keep it.\u2019 You said after the law...", "creator": "@BecketAdams", "url": "http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2013/11/14/cbs-reporter-hammers-away-until-obama-concedes-you-can-keep-it-promise-ended-up-not-being-accurate/", "image": "http://www.theblaze.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/507168808.jpg", "title": "Watch as CBS Reporter Hammers Away at President With Tough Obamacare Questions", "site": "@theblaze", "card": "summary", "account_id": 1512944287}, "keywords": "cbs, reporter, hammers, away, until, obama, concedes, you, can, keep, promise, ended, up, being, accurate", "sailthru.tags": "barack-obama, business, cbs-news, government, media, obamacare, video, author-becket-adams, site-theblazecom", "facebook-count": 7096, "gplus-count": 3, "msapplication-TileColor": "#282b2d", "sailthru.guid": "theblazecom/705619", "categories": "barack-obama,cbs-news,obamacare,video,business,government,media", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://www.theblaze.com/wp-content/plugins/theblaze_livetile/img/medium150x150.png", "comment-count": 208, "description": "CBS News' Major Garrett wasted no time Thursday hammering President Barack Obama during a press conference over his failed \u201cyou can keep it\u201d health insurance promise.  \u201cYou said while the law was being debated, \u2018If you like your plan, you can keep it.\u2019 You said after the law...", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://www.theblaze.com/wp-content/plugins/theblaze_livetile/img/wide310x150.png", "linkedin-count": 4, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://www.theblaze.com/wp-content/plugins/theblaze_livetile/img/small70x70.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://www.theblaze.com/wp-content/plugins/theblaze_livetile/img/large310x310.png", "fb": {"admins": 517831498}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.theblaze.com/", "viewport": "width=device-width", "og": {"site_name": "The Blaze", "description": "CBS News' Major Garrett wasted no time Thursday hammering President Barack Obama during a press conference over his failed \u201cyou can keep it\u201d health insurance promise.  \u201cYou said while the law was being debated, \u2018If you like your plan, you can keep it.\u2019 You said after the law...", "title": "Watch as CBS Reporter Hammers Away at President With Tough Obamacare Questions", "url": "http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2013/11/14/cbs-reporter-hammers-away-until-obama-concedes-you-can-keep-it-promise-ended-up-not-being-accurate/", "image": {"width": 606, "identifier": "http://www.theblaze.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/507168808.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "height": 409}, "type": "article"}, "dc.date": "2013-11-14T14:11:56+00:00", "twitter-count": 177}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fccc6c\"", "article_summary": "CBS News\u2019 Major Garrett wasted no time Thursday hammering President Barack Obama during a press conference over his failed \u201cyou can keep it\u201d health insurance promise.\nSo it\u2019s not on them, it\u2019s on us.\u201dYou can watch the full exchange here:\u2013Follow Becket Adams (@BecketAdams) on Twitter\nThat \u201cthe nuance you gave now was something (they) couldn\u2019t handle and (you) didn\u2019t trust the American people with the fuller truth?\u201d\u201cNo,\u201d the president said.\n\u201cDid you decide, sir, that the simple declaration was something the American people could handle?\u201d he asked.\nObama answered: \u201cThere is no doubt that the way I put that forward unequivocally ended up not being accurate."}
