As immigration advocates swarm the country trying to persuade House Republicans to pass a comprehensive immigration overhaul, Harris held a town hall meeting this August northeast of Baltimore, Md., with an overflow crowd who booed loudly when an audience member asked him to support a path to citizenship for immigrants in the U.S. illegally. Harris shot the idea down calling it a \"nonstarter\" that's \"not going anywhere fast\" in the House.

Andy Harris for his First Congressional District seat in Tuesday\u2019s Maryland Primary Election, but the three-term congressman says he is taking it in stride.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t begrudge anyone,\u201d he said of his opponents. \u201cThe more the merrier.\u201d\n\nHarris has more Republican opponents this year than he had in his two previous Primaries as an incumbent. Only one other Republican ran against him in 2014 and there were none in 2012.\n\nJonathan Goff and Sean Jackson, both of Harford County, and Michael Smigiel of Cecil County are all hoping to get the GOP nomination this year in the district which covers all nine Eastern Shore counties, plus parts of Harford, Baltimore and Carroll counties.\n\nOn the Democratic ballot are Jim Ireton, the former mayor of Salisbury, and Joe Werner, an attorney from Harford County.\n\nHarris said his main concerns are a stagnant economy and citizens\u2019 concerns about safety and terrorism. He also would like to see changes to government regulations that are \u201cstrangling\u201d the local poultry industry and other businesses.\n\n\u201cMy solution is to get the economy moving again by fostering an innovative environment where businesses can grow and start to create jobs again,\u201d he said. \u201cI plan to root out regulations that inhibit job growth and treat businesses as partners, not ATMs.\u201d\n\nOn his website, Harris also lists reducing the budget deficit, protecting the Chesapeake Bay and the environment, veterans as issues important to him.\n\nHarris would like to see the repeal of Obamacare, which he said has only made matters worse.\n\n\u201cReal reforms are necessary to make quality health care coverage more affordable and accessible,\u201d he said.\n\nSome of Harris\u2019 opponents have criticized him because he voted for a the Consolidated Appropriations Act that included funding for Obamacare as well as for a range of other federal programs and agencies including the Department of Homeland Security.\n\n\u201cI voted to keep the government running,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not in favor of Obamacare.\u201d\n\nTwo years ago, Harris, a medical doctor, faced criticism for his efforts to block marijuana decriminalization in the District of Columbia, but he defends that stance. Science is still unclear on the effects of marijuana, which he believes is a gateway drug for other drugs such as heroin.\n\n\u201cWhen people elected me to Congress, they elected me to oversee he District of Columbia,\u201d he said.\n\nHere is who else is running:\n\nRepublicans\n\nJonathan Marvin Goff Jr., a small business owner from Harford County, would like the U.S. to stop policing the world, and instead bring troops home to police the borders, according to information posted on his website. He, too, would like to see the repeal of Obamacare, which he said is killing jobs and causing people to lose their doctors and insurance rates. His solution to the deficit is to get rid of discretionary spending, make other countries pay back their debts to the U.S. and to top rebuilding other countries. Goff did not reply to an email request for more information.\n\nSean M. Jackson, a Motor Vehicle Division commander for the Support Services Bureau/Logistics Command of Maryland State Police, said he is running because \u201c83 percent of Maryland voters are dissatisfied with Congress (including me). Mr. Harris lacks passion and is not outspoken when addressing national issues (prevention of Syrian refugees from coming to America and veteran health care).\u201d On his website, Jackson also lists protection for gun owners, support for farms and small businesses, and the repeal of Obamacare as important issues.\n\nMichael D. Smigiel, a lawyer from Cecil County and a former member of the Maryland House of Delegates, said he decided to challenge Harris because \u201cI feel betrayed.\u201d If elected to Congress, Smigiel said he wants to get rid of Common Core, close the borders to illegal immigration, reintroduce free markets through capitalism, protect the autonomy of the states, to institute a flat tax, build and fund the military, care for our Veterans, and protect every single one of our Constitutional rights. \u201cI am tired of politicians promising to do all the right things then doing all the wrong things,\u201d he said.\n\nDemocrats\n\nJim Ireton, a former mayor of Salisbury and a current City Council member, said his focus would be on better constituent services if elected to Congress. Issues important to him include tackling the current heroin addiction epidemic, reducing nitrogen in the Chesapeake Bay and access to quality educations for all residents of the First District. He also is in favor of keeping Obamacare intact. \u201cThere are 63,000 people who now have health insurance who didn\u2019t before,\u201d he said. Ireton has been critical of Harris\u2019 decision to vote against an aid package for victims of Hurricane Sandy, many of whom are his constituents.\n\nJoe Werner, at attorney from Harford County, said climate change and the Chesapeake Bay are issues that should be taken seriously, particularly the cleanup of the Susquehanna River and the Conowingo Dam. \u201cWho knows what\u2019s in that sludge,\u201d he said. Werner also favors more free and fair trade, and an increase in the minimum wage. He called the current rate of $7.25 \u201cjust ridiculous,\u201d and said it should be raised to $15. \u201cIf people make more money, they\u2019ll spend more,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Primary Election in Maryland is on Tuesday, April 26. Polls are open from 7 a.m. until 8 p.m.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://www.delmarvanow.com/story/news/2016/04/25/andy-harris-not-worried-gop-challenges-primary/83390400/", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Three Republican challengers will try to unseat U.S. Rep.
