FM 89\u2019s Diana Aguilera reports how a young couple in Fresno County is dealing with the backlog.\n\nPaola Martinez and her husband Irving Toscano thought they had done everything right to get health care coverage.\n\nThey made sure they met the Medi-Cal eligibility requirements, they filled out the paperwork and signed up through the Covered California website at the end of March.\n\nBut ever since then, they\u2019ve been waiting.\n\n\"As time passed it was from excited like yay we\u2019re going to be covered to like what the heck when are we going to be covered?\" Martinez says.\n\nThe young couple is not alone. As of this week there are still more than 11,000 people in Fresno County waiting to hear the status of their Medi-Cal applications.\n\nTwo weeks ago Toscano thought his wait might finally be over when he received a letter from the county. The news? His application still hadn't been processed.\n\nHe says it\u2019s frustrating. \"I'll just keep waiting then, that\u2019s pretty much all I can do.\"\n\nThe expansion of coverage under the Affordable Care Act was meant to help people like Toscano and Martinez. The couple has a limited income and would seem to meet the requirements for Medi-Cal. He works as a security guard and she\u2019s unemployed. For the past three years, they\u2019ve been living at his parent's house in Clovis.\n\nNorman Williams, a spokesman for the state's department of health care services, says that statewide there\u2019s about 600,000 people like Toscano and Martinez whose applications are still pending.\n\n\"We enroll people into coverage each day and more people apply each day,\" he adds.\n\n\"It makes me nervous because, what if we don't get covered, what are we going to do?\" -Paola Martinez\n\nSo, what's causing this backlog?\n\nDeborah Martinez with Fresno County's department of social services says there's two main factors. First, when enrollment opened the state\u2019s computer systems didn\u2019t communicate properly with the county\u2019s computers.\n\n\"It was meant to be instantaneous and it hasn\u2019t been instantaneous at all,\" she says.\n\nThe county says that miscommunication stalled the approval process and helped create the backlog.\n\nThe other reason: Fresno County has been flooded with applicants. That's put a strain on resources both at the county and the state.\n\n\"It's a very comprehensive and detailed process but we are like 20 times better than where we were in January.\" - Deborah Martinez with Fresno County.\n\nStill Martinez says the process is now running much more smoothly than it was months ago.\n\n\"It's a very comprehensive and detailed process but we are like 20 times better than where we were in January.\"\n\nShe says as of this week, the county has approved about 64,000 Medi-Cal applications. And Williams says things are also improving statewide.\n\n\"The 600,000 is a considerable decrease since the roughly 900,000 who were pending at the end of March.\"\n\nBut if things are looking a lot better, why is the backlog still a problem?\n\nWell, unlike Covered California -- the state\u2019s health insurance exchange -- where the signup deadline was March 31, Medi-Cal accepts enrollments year round.\n\nAnd that means as the applications submitted earlier in the year are being finalized, new ones are coming in adding to the backlog.\n\n\"Applications are being taken by the date that they were submitted so our workers know to look at date of application and work those first,\" Debrah Martinez with Fresno County says.\n\nThat comes as little consolation to Toscano and his wife Martinez. They say it's been a troubling process, and if a health emergency were to happen, they\u2019re not sure where to turn for help, or how they'd pay for it.\n\n\"In a serious case I would have to go to emergency and find a way to how to pay my bills later on,\" he says. \"I don\u2019t have money saved up for any of those kind of bills.\u201d\n\nBack at Toscano\u2019s home in Clovis, they\u2019re getting ready to fire up the grill for dinner. The family is cooking steak fajitas while Toscano and Martinez play with their little nephew Elias who likes to honk the horn of his toy car.\n\nIt\u2019s a happy time for the young couple but concern about their health care looms large.\n\n\"It makes me nervous because, what if we don\u2019t get covered, what are we going to do?\u201d Martinez says. \"Hopefully we do because we need it, everyone needs it.\"\n\nWith any luck, their wait may soon be over. County officials say they\u2019ve made tremendous progress in processing Medi-Cal applications and expect to eliminate the the backlog by September 1.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Health", "description": "California\u2019s poor continue to face month long waits in getting state health coverage.
