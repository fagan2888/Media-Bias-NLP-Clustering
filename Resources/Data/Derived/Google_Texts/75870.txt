AMES, Iowa — A Huxley man has been arrested in connection with a sexual assault report, according to Iowa State University Police.

At approximately 1 p.m. on August 11, 2015, the ISU Police Department received a 911 call reporting a sexual assault at 4008 Maricopa Drive, in Ames.

Officers later executed a search warrant at that address and collected evidence. A subsequent investigation led to the arrest of Ryan Scott Evans, of Huxley. Evans was arrested Friday on a warrant charging him with three counts of 3rd degree sexual abuse, a class “C” felony.

Evans was later transported to the Story County Jail.
