Many rooms at the Embassy Suites will have an unobstructed view of Touchdown Jesus and Notre Dame Stadium.\n\nDeveloper Kite Realty Group has not yet announced the construction timetable and did not return messages late last week seeking additional information about the hotel. Cooper Carry of Alexandria, Va., has been identified as the project architect.\n\nThere\u2019s no question that having an Embassy Suites in the market will elevate the image of South Bend as a destination, says Rob DeCleene, executive director of Visit South Bend Mishawaka.\n\n\u201cIt will be the only Embassy Suites in the state of Indiana outside of Indianapolis, so that tells you something,\u201d DeCleene says. \u201cOf course, it will be a popular hotel for any Notre Dame function, football or otherwise.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s not to say there won\u2019t be what DeCleene refers to as \u201cgrowing pains\u201d in the local hotel market with the addition of the Embassy Suites and several other hotel properties that are either under construction or planned in South Bend and Mishawaka.\n\nBut he says the central location of campus relative to South Bend, Mishawaka and St. Joseph County will be a year-round advantage for Embassy Suites. \u201cI expect it to be rather successful and an overall boon for our local industry. It\u2019s very exciting,\u201d he says.\n\nNotre Dame\u2019s latest economic impact report, which was issued in June, estimates an $18.5 million annual economic impact from the 370,000 visitors who travel to campus for football weekends, says Notre Dame spokesman Dennis Brown.\n\nIn addition to hotels, Brown says, the dollar figure includes visitor spending in restaurants, at grocery stores, and at gas stations, as well as other at various other businesses.\n\nThough area hotels are reporting strong bookings for Notre Dame home games, as many as 500 rooms will be added to the current stock of 4,100 rooms across St. Joseph County in the next few years. That\u2019s a 12 percent increase in the number of rooms compared with the existing supply, DeCleene says.\n\nOutside of the Embassy Suites, only a couple of street-level commercial vacancies remain in Eddy Street phase one. Yats recently opened in the former General Nutrition Center store, Blaze Pizza replaced Hot Box Pizza and TIAA-CREF opened offices in the former Outpost Sports store.\n\nNotre Dame is actively engaged in exclusive discussions with Kite Realty regarding a tentative plan for phase two, says Greg Hakanen, Notre Dame\u2019s director of Northeast Neighborhood Redevelopment.\n\nLike phase one, Hakanen says, the second phase will be developed on off-campus land assembled by the university.\n\nEarlier this year, university officials polled multiple constituent groups \u2014 students, faculty and staff \u2014 about what they\u2019d like to see in the second phase that extends the mixed-use development south on Eddy Street.\n\nThere has been widespread interest in a grocery store and more unique concept restaurants, Hakanen says.\n\n\u201cWe shared those preferences with Kite, who is now in the process of drafting a conceptual development plan that identifies uses, quantities and potential building footprints,\u201d he says.\n\nThis process will continue until Notre Dame and Kite identify a mutually agreeable plan. When a tentative plan is in hand, Hakanen says, university officials will solicit input from area constituents, including the Northeast Neighborhood Revitalization Organization and neighborhood residents.\n\n\u201cIt is impossible at this point to predict how long the process will take, or when construction on phase two might begin,\u201d he says.\n\nHave you heard\n\nSecond Time Around consignment shop has reopened at 51160 Bittersweet Road, in Granger. The locally owned store was previously located at Granger Commons strip center. \u2026 JJ Fish is planning a new location at 1619 S. Michigan St., in South Bend, according to a state construction report. \u2026 Mark your calendars, because the dates for Elkhart Dining Days have been set for Oct. 30 through Nov. 7.\n\nHeidi Prescott\u2019s column runs on Wednesdays and Sundays.
