Yet we rarely do these things.\n\nRelated: The Surprising Way Millionaires Spend Their Money\n\nThe same is true of millionaires.\n\nDeVere Group, a global financial consulting firm, surveyed 880 high net worth clients with more than $1 million in investable assets, asking them to disclose their number one investing mistake before seeking professional financial advice.\n\nHere are the five top investment mistakes the millionaires revealed \u2013 and why they should have known better:\n\n1- Failing to adequately diversify a portfolio: Spreading money around is vital to curb risk.\n\n2- Investing without a plan: Unless you have a sound plan, you\u2019re gambling, not investing.\n\n3- Making emotional decisions: It\u2019s far better to stay calm, cool and steady when making financial decisions.\n\n4- Failing to regularly review a portfolio: Even the best portfolios can go off-target over time.\n\n5- Focusing too much on historical returns: Past returns have little bearing on the current environment.\n\n\u201cInvesting mistakes can and do occur. It is how they are best avoided, or at least mitigated, that is the key to success,\u201d said Nigel Green, deVere\u2019s founder and chief executive, in a statement. The survey respondents were based in the U.S., the U.K., South Africa, Hong Kong, Japan, the United Arab Emirates, Indonesia and Thailand.\n\nRelated: Get Used to It: The Rich Do Get Richer\n\nWhether you\u2019re a millionaire or not, you can learn lessons from all of this \u2013 or hire a financial advisor.\n\n\u201cAvoiding just one of these mistakes can literally make the difference between poverty and financial freedom,\u201d concluded Green.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "They have more money than most Americans do \u2013 but millionaires still make investment mistakes.
