ANALYSIS/OPINION:

The Grand Old Party still has many grassroots fans, and the campaign war chest continues to grow. Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus says the organization raised a record-breaking $8.7 million in October, bringing their total in the 2016 election cycle to $89.3 million. Ninety nine percent of the donations are $200 or less; the average donation was $69.

“With just under a year until Election Day 2016 we’re seeing great enthusiasm for the GOP,” Mr. Priebus said, noting that the party is in the midst of a full scale effort to built a data and field infrastructure aiming to defeat Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton, while recruiting volunteers and voters “in every community and every battleground state.”

Mr. Priebus added, “The RNC is the only organization on either side of the aisle currently running a full-scale general election field operation.”

The organization has $20.4 million in cash on hand, and $1.8 million in debt.
