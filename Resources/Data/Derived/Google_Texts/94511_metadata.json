( Rendon photo: David Gorn/California Healthline )\n\nWhen Anthony Rendon, D-Paramount, is sworn in as Assembly Speaker Monday, it will mark a historic moment in California politics: For the first time, the two top posts in the state legislature will be held by Latinos.\n\nRendon will join Senate President Pro Tem Kevin de Le\u00f3n, D-Los Angeles, at the top of the Capitol\u2019s political pyramid, a development that could signal much brighter prospects for health care legislation \u2014 especially the effort to provide adult immigrants who are living here illegally with coverage under Medi-Cal, the government program for people with low incomes.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re witnessing is a dramatic surge in power. I think it will be a new and dramatic change in California,\u201d said Jaime Regalado, a political science professor emeritus at California State University Los Angeles.\n\nThe power of the Latino caucus in the state, he said, has reached a point where the top items on its agenda are becoming the top items on the legislature\u2019s agenda.\n\nThat agenda is weighted toward health care and education, he noted \u2014 from Medi-Cal expansion to paid sick leave to health coverage for children of those in the United States illegally.\n\nAside from Rendon and de Le\u00f3n, other Latino leaders in Sacramento also play a big role in Capitol health care politics, including Ed Hernandez, D-West Covina, who heads the Senate Committee on Health and has authored dozens of health-related bills; Lorena Gonzalez, D-San Diego, in Assembly Health, who spearheaded the mandate for paid sick leave; and Ricardo Lara, D-Bell Gardens, who wrote the bill to provide Medi-Cal coverage to children of people living in the United States.\n\n\u201cEverybody has been calling [the Latino community] the sleeping giant for so many years. But it has been awake for some time now,\u201d Regalado said. \u201cLatinos have always been concerned about their communities, and they have had the highest proportion of those without health care, so Latino leaders are going to rank those issues high on their list.\u201d\n\nThree years after the advent of Covered California and the expansion of Medi-Cal, nearly three-quarters of the roughly 3 million remaining uninsured in the state are Latino, according to a January 2015 study by UCLA and UC Berkeley researchers.\n\nThis year the wish list of Latino leaders includes a bill sponsored by de Le\u00f3n to provide housing and mental health treatment for the chronically homeless \u2014 many of whom suffer from mental illness. And following last year\u2019s successful move to offer full Medi-Cal coverage to undocumented children in California, the next step is to extend it to their adult counterparts, according to Rendon.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important, and it\u2019s important now,\u201d said incoming Assembly Speaker Rendon in an interview at last Saturday\u2019s state Democratic convention in San Jose. \u201cCovering undocumented immigrants is certainly something that resonates with me from a personal point of view, and from the caucus point of view it\u2019s really high on our list.\u201d\n\nRendon noted that de Le\u00f3n\u2019s background also makes the Senate leader sympathetic to the goal of providing coverage for immigrants without legal documents. Because it requires heavy political lifting, he said, \u201cit certainly needs to be near the top of the agenda to succeed.\u201d\n\nBefore he joined the Assembly in 2012, Rendon was executive director of the nonprofit Plaza de la Raza Child Development Services, which provides social and medical services to children in Pico Rivera, east of Los Angeles. De Le\u00f3n spent time as a community organizer for immigrant rights before becoming a member of the legislature in 2006.\n\nThough Medi-Cal for immigrant children without papers was approved and will take effect in May, providing that coverage for adults with the same immigration status is highly controversial and promises to be a tough political slog.\n\n\u201cIn general, the direction the legislature has taken over the past decade or two has been to serve people who are in California illegally, and that takes benefits from other people,\u201d said Ira Mehlman, spokesman for the Washington, D.C.-based Federation for American Immigration Reform, which lobbied in Sacramento against \u201cMedi-Cal for all\u201d when it was first put before the legislature last year.\n\n\u201cWe think that just encourages people who violate laws, and deprives other people in the state of needed resources,\u201d Mehlman said.\n\nRegalado said that despite strong opposition, Medi-Cal coverage for the adults could succeed with the expected political push from Rendon and de Le\u00f3n.\n\n\u201cThey will be emboldened,\u201d Regalado said. \u201cThey have enormous political power right now.\u201d\n\nRendon said access to health care, especially in rural areas, will also be a top legislative priority.\n\nThe amount spent on Medi-Cal could change too, said Gerald Kominski, director of the UCLA Center for Health Policy Research.\n\nSince the expansion of Medi-Cal began under the Affordable Care Act, enrollment in the program has expanded significantly. Medi-Cal now covers 13.3 million Californians \u2014 one-third of the state\u2019s population.\n\n\u201cCalifornia is now serving a huge percentage of Latinos in Medi-Cal,\u201d Kominski said, \u201cand that continues to be seen as underfunded. I think you\u2019ll see increased attention on that.\u201d\n\nThe Latino caucus, the largest political caucus in the state, flexed its political muscles last weekend at the state Democratic convention in San Jose.\n\nIn contrast to typically sedate, run-of-the-mill convention caucus meetings, the Latino caucus meeting last week was a high-energy event, more akin to a family reunion.\n\nTo one side of the front stage, a corner set aside for visiting dignitaries was packed with dozens of political heavyweights \u2014 a who\u2019s who of legislators all waiting for their one minute at the microphone to address the crowded room.\n\n\u201cWe are a blue state because of this community!\u201d shouted former Los Angeles mayor Antonio Villaraigosa to the cheering crowd. \u201cWe are the future!\u201d\n\nWhile Latinos tend to share an interest in some issues, they are represented across the political spectrum.\n\nA 2014 report by the Public Policy Institute of California showed likely Latino voters register in far higher numbers as Democrats (59 percent) than as Republicans (18 percent) or independents (17 percent). But it also noted that many Latino Democrats are politically conservative. And it found Latino voters are as likely to identify themselves as liberal (34 percent) as they are to call themselves middle of the road (33 percent) or conservative (33 percent).\n\nU.S. Congressman Xavier Becerra, D-Los Angeles, chairman of the House Democratic Caucus and the fourth highest ranking Democrat in the House, said he\u2019s been heartened by the growing political power of Latinos and what he characterized as their enormous legislative accomplishments.\n\n\u201cThat wave you see on the horizon, it hasn\u2019t hit the beach yet, but it\u2019s coming,\u201d Becerra said at the state Democratic convention. \u201cYou now have Latinos as the top two leaders in the state, behind the governor. There are moments that crystallize in the minds of people, and this is one of them. It\u2019s coming.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "When Anthony Rendon is sworn in as Assembly speaker Monday, it will mark the first time the two top posts in the Legislature will be held by Latinos.", "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"Rise of Latino Political Power in Sacramento Could Give New Momentum to Health Care\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/2016\\/03\\/04\\/latino-political-power-in-sacramento-health-care\\/\",\"pub_date\":\"2016-03-04 10:47:00\",\"mod_date\":\"2016-03-04 16:23:24\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":156627,\"author_id\":\"8344\",\"author_name\":\"State of Health\",\"author_display_name\":\"State of Health\",\"tags\":[\"Covered California\",\"Latino Health\",\"Medi-Cal\",\"News\"],\"categories\":[\"Policy\"],\"image\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/sites\\/27\\/2016\\/03\\/Screen-Shot-2016-03-04-at-10.45.38-AM.png\"}", "og": {"site_name": "State of Health", "description": "When Anthony Rendon is sworn in as Assembly speaker Monday, it will mark the first time the two top posts in the Legislature will be held by Latinos.", "title": "Rise of Latino Political Power in Sacramento Could Give New Momentum to Health Care", "url": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/2016/03/04/latino-political-power-in-sacramento-health-care/", "image": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/wp-content/uploads/sites/27/2016/03/Screen-Shot-2016-03-04-at-10.45.38-AM.png", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@kqedhealth", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@"}, "fb": {"app_id": 160023622793}, "keywords": "covered california,latino health,medi-cal,news", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "I think you\u2019ll see increased attention on that.\u201dThe Latino caucus, the largest political caucus in the state, flexed its political muscles last weekend at the state Democratic convention in San Jose.\nIn contrast to typically sedate, run-of-the-mill convention caucus meetings, the Latino caucus meeting last week was a high-energy event, more akin to a family reunion.\nThat agenda is weighted toward health care and education, he noted \u2014 from Medi-Cal expansion to paid sick leave to health coverage for children of those in the United States illegally.\nI think it will be a new and dramatic change in California,\u201d said Jaime Regalado, a political science professor emeritus at California State University Los Angeles.\n\u201cThey have enormous political power right now.\u201dRendon said access to health care, especially in rural areas, will also be a top legislative priority."}
