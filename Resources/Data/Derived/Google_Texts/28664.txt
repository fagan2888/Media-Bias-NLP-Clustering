Sen. Jeff Sessions (R., Ala.) and Rep. Fred Upton (R., Mich.) are challenging the legal authority for the Department of Health and Human Services to make payments for Obamacare’s risk corridor program, calling it another example of the administration’s “disregard toward the law and Congress.”

HHS justified its spending by categorizing the payments as user fees, even though that is not how they were categorized in the president’s own budget.

The congressmen said the administration “ignores the law” in a joint statement on Thursday.
