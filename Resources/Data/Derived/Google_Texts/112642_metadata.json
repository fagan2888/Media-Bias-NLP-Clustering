The unions and community groups will drop all charges of contempt and end any threats of litigation. In exchange, SUNY will rewrite and reopen the RFP, calling for new offers to take over the hospital. The settlement also allows SUNY to begin laying off staff at the hospital, which has had more than 1,400 employees despite only having about two dozen admitted patients. Full details of the settlement will be released today. http://capi.tl/1oXE1X0\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY -- SUNY agreed to reopen the RFP for only three weeks. That was important to SUNY because LICH is costing $13 million per month. In exchange for the very small window, the community groups will finally have a seat at the table. The new RFP will be heavily tilted toward medical services, according to two sources familiar with negotiations. Also, look for language that allows the community groups some type of voting power when the new proposals are scored. The question on the table: Is three weeks enough time for a new bidder to consider LICH, or will we end up with the same four developers offering essentially the same proposals?\n\nRED HANDED -\u2013 A former Empire State Development Corporation employee violated state ethics laws by seeking state grants for a private health care company. S. Helen Daniels, former director of the ESDC\u2019s Affirmative Action Unit, admitted that in 2009 she entered into a $15,000 contract with CarePath, a now-defunct New York City-based health care software company, according to a state press release. She agreed to pay a $5,000 fine as part of a settlement with the Joint Commission on Public Ethics. The contract called for Daniels to help CarePath obtain state grants and contracts. Here is a copy of the settlement: http://bit.ly/1fl4f1r\n\nNOW WE KNOW \u2013- Money makes parenting less meaningful, according to an article published in the Journal of Experimental Social Psychology. And it's not just having cash, the authors say. Just thinking about money diminishes the meaning people derive from parenting. That's because if you have lots and lots of money, the menial tasks of parenting just don't seem as exciting. The effects were found to be greater in moms than in dads. http://bit.ly/1bpINZM\n\nWE'D LOVE TO HEAR FROM YOU: This roundup is for you so please tell us how we can make it even better.

MGMA urged CMS to \u201cexpand the scope of this testing approach to include any provider who wishes to test with them, as well as quickly disseminating results from all Medicare and Medicaid testing efforts.\u201d The testing will take place in early March, which means it won't be long before we have at least a partial sense of how well this will work.\n\n\u2026 MedPage Today is highlighting some of the sillier codes found in ICD-10, such as V97.33XD, which doctors should use for all subsequent encounters with patients who have been sucked into a jet engine. http://bit.ly/NeCygd\n\nGET YOUR GOVERNMENT HANDS OFF \u2014- House and Senate Republicans are demanding the Obama administration withdraw a rule overhauling Medicare Part D, according to Politico. \u201c[F]ailure to reject this rule will force Congress to evaluate all legislative options necessary to ensure seniors are protected,\u201d wrote Senate Finance Committee ranking member Orrin Hatch, Energy and Commerce Chairman Fred Upton and Ways and Means Chairman Dave Camp.

Other studies show that when people don\u2019t have to worry about health insurance, they are up to 25 percent more likely to change jobs. Obamacare was designed, in part, to fix this inefficiency in the labor market, and thanks to that association, job lock has become a political lightning rod.\u201d http://nyti.ms/1mx1O16\n\n\n\nMAKING ROUNDS \u2013- Michael Fagan is now senior vice president of government relations and communications at Health Republic Insurance of New York.

Overall, the study underscores the need for early interventions.\"\n\nhttp://bit.ly/1haXSMK\n\n-POSSIBLE VACCINE \u2013- Researchers at Rutgers University have modeled the structure of a hepatitis C surface protein, which they believe could assist in the development of a vaccine. The study published Wednesday in Nature shows how the virus evades the immune system. Rutgers researchers believe that by identifying the virus' outer protein, scientists might be able to develop a vaccine that targets the immune system to vulnerable regions of the virus in order to prevent infection. http://bit.ly/1mu3icz", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.capitalnewyork.com/article/city-hall/2014/02/8540636/capital-health-care-settlement-paves-way-lich-sale-former-state-of", "image": "http://www.capitalnewyork.com/sites/all/themes/capitalny/images/cap.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "Capital Health Care: Settlement paves way for LICH sale, former state official fined"}, "robots": "all", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "description": "New York health news"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2ce5\"", "article_summary": "STATE GRANTS -\u2013 The New York State Health Foundation has awarded more than $400,000 to community-based organizations across the state as part of the National Diabetes Prevention Program.\nRED HANDED -\u2013 A former Empire State Development Corporation employee violated state ethics laws by seeking state grants for a private health care company.\nGet bite-size \u201cwhiteboard\" alerts that focus specifically on health care issues sent directly to your inbox.\n(h/t Dr. C.
