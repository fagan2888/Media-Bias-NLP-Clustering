(Video via OWN)\n\n\"Being GQ man of the year is a great honor and a great privilege,\" Sam told GQ in 2014.\n\nThough Sam became part of pop culture and sports history, his professional football career hasn't taken off despite an impressive resume playing for the University of Missouri. (Video via Visa)\n\nAnd Sam has made it pretty clear that he thinks he would still be in the NFL if he didn't come out before being drafted. (Video via ESPN)\n\n\"It probably would\u2019ve been better if I didn\u2019t come out, I\u2019d be on a roster,\" Sam said recently on \"The Dan Patrick Show.\"\n\nIt's tough to say definitively, though. For one, Outsports' co-founder wrote NFL scouts and national media were asking enough questions that Sam made his announcement earlier than intended, feeling the news would inevitably get out with or without his consent. Also Sam's been generally regarded as a speedy, but undersized prospect with an uncertain role in the NFL.\n\nThere\u2019s no way to prove any homophobia from teams Sam has played for or teams that have passed on signing him, but it is clear that his career took a much more negative turn after coming out compared to someone like Robbie Rogers, soccer\u2019s first out active player.\n\n\"For the past 25 years, I've been afraid to show whom I really was because of fear. Fear that judgment and rejection would hold me back from my dreams and aspirations,\" Rogers told ABC.\n\nAfter coming out, Rogers was picked up by the L.A. Galaxy and has seemingly been able to distance his sexuality from his athletic ability. Something, it seems, Sam hasn\u2019t been able to do.\n\nWhile Sam embracing his full self publicly may not have helped his career, he\u2019s been able to use his experiences to inspire underprivileged children to be themselves. In one way, with T-shirts that say \"great things can happen when you have the courage to be yourself.\" (Video via Coca-Cola Co.)\n\nThis video includes images from Getty Images.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Michael Sam thinks if he hadn't come out, he'd still be in the NFL; there's no way to prove that, but his post-coming out career hasn't gone smoothly.", "og": {"site_name": "Newsy", "description": "Michael Sam thinks if he hadn't come out, he'd still be in the NFL; there's no way to prove that, but his post-coming out career hasn't gone smoothly.", "title": "What's Changed After Michael Sam's Coming Out?", "url": "http://www.newsy.com/videos/what-s-changed-after-michael-sam-s-coming-out/", "image": "http://newsymain.npgroup.netdna-cdn.com/images/videos/m/1444503386.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Michael Sam thinks if he hadn't come out, he'd still be in the NFL; there's no way to prove that, but his post-coming out career hasn't gone smoothly.", "title": "What's Changed After Michael Sam's Coming Out?", "url": "https://www.newsy.com/videos/what-s-changed-after-michael-sam-s-coming-out/", "image": "https://newsymain-npgroup.netdna-ssl.com/images/videos/m/1444503386.jpg", "site": "@newsyvideos", "player": {"width": 400, "identifier": "https://player.ooyala.com/tframe.html?embedCode=9zaXk0eDpfGDjy9D3v5Pb3xntUntFVRx&pbid=54ea1c2f14ee44369ddf31ac887ffe7e", "height": 225}, "app": {"url": {"ipad": "newsy://51933", "iphone": "newsy://51933", "googleplay": "com.newsy"}, "name": {"ipad": "Newsy: Video News", "iphone": "Newsy: Video News", "googleplay": "Newsy: Multisource Video News"}, "id": {"ipad": 330879884, "iphone": 330879884, "googleplay": "com.newsy"}}, "card": "player"}, "al": {"ios": {"url": "newsy://51933", "app_store_id": 330879884, "app_name": "Newsy: Video News"}}, "msvalidate.01": "675C8D40A5F1E0722AA2D3A33379E884", "fb": {"app_id": 380870506022, "pages": 49978948774}, "google-site-verification": "o36fft0HATmhbZ_GPX4YSOS3EmkTGkPrvNFxQwzcNbY", "keywords": "michael sam,michael sam gay,michael sam football,football homophobia,michael sam football career,michael sam publicity,michael sam career,michael sam homophobia,michael sam rams,michael sam rams,michael sam oprah,newsy,newsy sports", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/newsyvideos"}, "thumbnail": "http://newsymain.npgroup.netdna-cdn.com/images/videos/m/1444503386.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdbe67\"", "article_summary": "One sentence in 2014 \u2014\"I\u2019m Michael Sam, I\u2019m a football player and I\u2019m gay,\" football player Michael Sam said in an interview with The New York Times.\n\u2014 changed Michael Sam\u2019s life \u2014 and after he was drafted, the world of football.\n(Video via OWN)\"Being GQ man of the year is a great honor and a great privilege,\" Sam told GQ in 2014.\nMichael Sam thinks if he hadn't come out, he'd still be in the NFL; there's no way to prove that, but his post-coming out career hasn't gone smoothly.\n(Video via Coca-Cola Co.)This video includes images from Getty Images."}
