If the call is made during business hours and the client is at work there are times when they cannot answer when the agent call to make the connection and the process has to be repeated. This is a waste of time. This is very frustrating for the client and for the agent.\n\nWhen an agent who uses a direct enrollment pathway works with a client who has an application in the system from a previous year, they can look up the client\u2019s application in the system. But in order to start the new application for the current year the agent has to initiate a three-way call so a call center representative can manually begin the application to unlock it. Then the agent can log back in to complete the application with their client.
