On Wednesday’s edition of Fox News’ “The Five,” host Greg Gutfeld condemned the murder of 50-year-old Walter L. Scott at the hands of Officer Michael Slager, but, for some reason, refused to acknowledge that they were men of different races.

“This is the great thing about that horrible, horrible tape, and why it’s necessary that cameras are everywhere,” Gutfeld said. “I didn’t see a black man killed by a white cop; I saw a man shoot another man in the back. I saw an actual act. You can’t theorize. You can’t come up with hypotheticals. You actually see that.”

The thing is that you also see a black man killed by a white cop, whether Gutfeld wants to acknowledge it or not.
