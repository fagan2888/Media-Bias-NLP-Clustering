Perhaps you\u2019ve even rescued a few from the peril of oncoming traffic.\n\nBut there\u2019s a lot more to these terrestrial critters than meets the eye.\n\nContained within their hard shells is a genetic key to over 200 million years of evolutionary history -- much of which has remained a mystery to scientists and researchers. Well, until now, that is.\n\nThis hour, we look at some new turtle research that might just surprise you and find out more about how these reptiles are faring in our state.\n\nTo learn more about becoming a volunteer with the DEEP's conservation programs, click here.\n\nGUESTS:\n\nDaniel Field - Doctoral candidate in geology and geophysics at Yale; predoctoral fellow at the Smithsonian Institution\u2019s National Museum of Natural History\n\n- Doctoral candidate in geology and geophysics at Yale; predoctoral fellow at the Smithsonian Institution\u2019s National Museum of Natural History Dennis Quinn - Environmental ecologist who specializing in reptile and amphibian research; herpetologist with the DEEP; founder of CTHerpConsultant, LLC\n\n- Environmental ecologist who specializing in reptile and amphibian research; herpetologist with the DEEP; founder of CTHerpConsultant, LLC Chuck Landrey - Executive Director of the Turtle Conservation Project", "article_metadata": {"category": "Environment", "description": "There are currently some 57 turtle species living in the United States and Canada, 12 of which can be found right here in Connecticut -- including some sea", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "Where We Live", "og": {"url": "http://wnpr.org/post/everything-you-want-know-about-turtles", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/wnpr/files/styles/medium/public/201405/photo.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "There are currently some 57 turtle species living in the United States and Canada, 12 of which can be found right here in Connecticut -- including some sea", "title": "Everything You Want to Know About Turtles"}, "story_id": 313003379, "twitter": {"site": "@wnpr", "card": "summary", "creator": "@@johndankosky"}, "author": "John Dankosky, Lydia Brown, Tucker Ives, Catie Talarski", "org_id": 0, "dc": {"title": "Everything You Want to Know About Turtles"}, "nid": 21949, "datePublished": "2014-05-16", "keywords": "environment, animals, science, research", "wordCount": 275, "has_audio": 1, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "This hour, we look at some new turtle research that might just surprise you and find out more about how these reptiles are faring in our state.\nThere are currently some 57 turtle species living in the United States and Canada, 12 of which can be found right here in Connecticut -- including some sea turtles!\nChances are, you\u2019ve probably seen a few of them poking around a nearby pond or basking on some sunlit rocks.\nPerhaps you\u2019ve even rescued a few from the peril of oncoming traffic.\nTo learn more about becoming a volunteer with the DEEP's conservation programs, click here."}
