We tend to prioritize one over the other, creating a rift that leaves us disheveled and unbalanced. While unhealthy lifestyles can lead to an array of problems like acidity, indigestion, stress, and other lifestyle-related illnesses, Ayurveda can help create harmony between the body, mind and spirit, to maintain a balance that boosts our health.\n\nThe practice of Ayurveda stems from the belief all areas of life impact our health. In the U.S., Ayurveda is a complementary health care option used by many Americans who incorporate Ayurvedic elements such as massage, meditation, or cleansing therapies to treat conditions. Pamela Quinn, Ayurvedic specialist, yoga teacher, social entrepreneur, life coach, and author of The Elemental Cleanse, believes Ayurveda is \u201cthe mother of healing.\u201d \"As such, this philosophy contains very practical routines to maintain health and prevent disease,\" Quinn told Medical Daily in an email.\n\nFrom morning to night, these Ayurvedic health hacks will help us teach the human body how to stay healthy, naturally.\n\n1. Drink Warm Water With A Lemon In The Morning\n\nDrinking warm lemon water is one of the easiest Ayurvedic ways to improve our health. The acidity of lemon promotes regularity in the body to help prevent toxic build-up in the digestive track. Warm water can remove the accumulated toxins floating around the bloodstream, and prevent it from staying put and triggering illnesses. Quinn suggests, \u201cBefore breakfast, drink hot water with a little bit of lemon to stoke the digestive fire.\u201d It\u2019s important to make sure the water is room temperature, since cold water in the morning can actually shock your system.\n\n2. Add Cinnamon To Tea/Coffee\n\nCinnamon is considered to be \u201cthe ancient healing spice\u201d that not only enhances the flavor of any dish, but also has numerous health benefits seen in Ayurvedic medicine. Sunita Kumar, functional nutritionist and woman\u2019s health expert, who struggled with polycystic ovary syndrome, believes in the power of food based medicine. Cinnamon is a \u201csoothing Ayurvedic spice that regulates blood sugar which caffeine throws off,\u201d Kumar told Medical Daily in an email. The spice also soothes the nervous system.\n\n3. Scrape Your Tongue\n\nAyurvedic medicine suggests our tongue can teach us about our health. This is because tongue surface is known to be the breeding grounds for accumulated toxicity. Using a steel tongue scraper can remove the \u201cama\u201d \u2014 toxins on our tongue \u2014 and stimulate certain nerves that stimulate digestion. A tongue scraper will prevent the toxins from getting reabsorbed by the body, which can lead to breathing difficulties, digestive problems, and a weaker immune system. \u201cScrapping helps remove them from the body and helps in a variety of health issues,\u201d Kumar said.\n\n4. Do Oil Pulling\n\nOil pulling is one of the recently best known Ayurvedic practices. Gargling with coconut or sesame oil for 10 to 20 minutes in your mouth helps remove the hundreds of bacteria, including Streptococcus. Irene Ross, health and nutrition coach, told Medical Daily in an email, oil pulling, especially in the case of Streptococcus bacteria, \u201caids sinus infections and sore throat.\u201d It\u2019s crucial to remove as many toxins from the mouth, according to Ross, because bacteria\u2019s ability from the mouth to the heart, and other organs is highly possible.\n\n5. Oil Your Body\n\nMassaging the body with oil helps improve the texture of the skin and provides you with a healthy glow. It\u2019s best to put massage oil on yourself in the morning before bathing or showering for optimal absorption. Overall, \u201cOil massage helps to detoxify and reduce stress, remove chemicals and energy that are throwing off balance in the body,\u201d Kumar said.\n\n6. Get Good Sleep\n\nWhether it\u2019s Ayurvedic medicine or no medicine, it\u2019s well known getting a good night\u2019s sleep is essential for proper functioning the following morning. Maintaining a regular sleep schedule is considered one of the main focal points of health in Ayurveda, suggesting we need to be protective of our sleep time. Maharishi Ayurveda, a blog based in the UK, reads, \u201cAyurveda describes sleep as one of the three pillars of health, along with food and a balanced life.\u201d Ideally, it recommends to sleep from 10 p.m. until no later than 6 a.m. to start the day with a fresh and clear mind.\n\nThese Ayurvedic health tips will train your body to help you stay healthy and live a long life.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "ayurveda, ayurvedic medicine, human body, how to stay healthy, health tips, warm water, cinnamon, tongue scrapping, oil pulling, oil massage, sleep", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Teach your body how to stay healthy and prevent the onset of illness with these Ayurvedic hacks \u2014 from tongue scraping to oil pulling \u2014 to restore the balance in your life.", "title": "6 Ayurvedic Health Hacks To Add To Your Daily Routine", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/natural-healing-6-ayurvedic-ways-teach-human-body-how-stay-healthy-295364", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/07/28/shutterstock152601116.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Teach your body how to stay healthy and prevent the onset of illness with these Ayurvedic hacks \u2014 from tongue scraping to oil pulling \u2014 to restore the balance in your life.", "title": "6 Ayurvedic Health Hacks To Add To Your Daily Routine", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/natural-healing-6-ayurvedic-ways-teach-human-body-how-stay-healthy-295364", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/07/28/shutterstock152601116.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/07/28/shutterstock152601116.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Healthy Living", "published_time": "2014-07-28T17:34:23-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-07-28T17:34:22-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Teach your body how to stay healthy and prevent the onset of illness with these Ayurvedic hacks \u2014 from tongue scraping to oil pulling \u2014 to restore the balance in your life."}, "article_summary": "From morning to night, these Ayurvedic health hacks will help us teach the human body how to stay healthy, naturally.\nThese Ayurvedic health tips will train your body to help you stay healthy and live a long life.\nTeach your body how to stay healthy and prevent the onset of illness with these Ayurvedic hacks \u2014 from tongue scraping to oil pulling \u2014 to restore the balance in your life.\nOil Your BodyMassaging the body with oil helps improve the texture of the skin and provides you with a healthy glow.\nDrink Warm Water With A Lemon In The MorningDrinking warm lemon water is one of the easiest Ayurvedic ways to improve our health."}
