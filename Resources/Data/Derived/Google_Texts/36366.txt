Police say a 25-year-old black woman was holding a fake handgun when she was shot by officers.

The Norfolk Police Department says investigators in the Vice and Narcotics Division were conducting a surveillance operation early Saturday when they came across a fight in a parking lot.

Police say the officers saw a woman brandish a handgun and threaten an unarmed man. The department says the officers approached the woman, who refused to comply with their demands and made a threatening motion with the handgun.

The department says investigators shot India M. Beaty to death. An investigation determined that the handgun was a non-firing replica.

The department says the officers names won't be released until the investigation is complete. The race of the officers was not released.
