But welfare policy analysts from across the ideological spectrum question the wisdom of the restrictions.\n\nAnalysts say the Kansas law, the nation\u2019s most restrictive, saddles welfare recipients with extra bank fees because it limits ATM withdrawals to $25; prohibits a state agency from using state or federal funds to educate needy families about food stamp eligibility; and makes it more difficult for the poor to pay their rent or buy cheaper gasoline in neighboring Missouri.\n\nGroups such as the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities (CBPP) have sharply criticized the Kansas law. Liz Schott, a senior fellow at CBPP, said the law stigmatizes welfare recipients by creating the impression that they are gaming the system.\n\nRachel Sheffield, a policy analyst at the conservative Heritage Foundation, also questioned the effectiveness of Kansas\u2019 strategy. Sheffield said there is no evidence of widespread fraud involving Electronic Benefit Transfer (EBT) cards, which function like debit cards. Passing laws restricting the use of benefits is easier than crafting truly effective policy, she said.\n\n\u201cThere are stories that will come out about individuals spending their dollars on casinos, and people get riled up about those things, which is understandable. So you have policymakers putting forth these kinds of laws,\u201d Sheffield said. \u201cBut this doesn\u2019t get to the heart of what is needed for reform.\u201d\n\nRelated: Welfare Crackdown: Kansas Bans Cruises for the Poor\n\nFrom Welfare to Work?\n\nThe Kansas law codifies policies that the Kansas Department for Children and Family Services has had in place since 2011, said Theresa Freed, the department\u2019s director of communications. Some of the law\u2019s more controversial components, such as the $25 ATM limit, were the result of amendments introduced by lawmakers, she said.\n\nThe law also bans the use of EBT cards to pay for a wide variety of items and services, from alcohol to amusement parks, massage parlors, concerts and sporting events.\n\n\u201cThe law is really about encouraging individuals to become employed. We believe that employment is the most effective path out of poverty,\u201d Freed said.\n\nRelated: How Your Tax Dollars Subsidize Low-Wage Industries\n\nBetween 2013 and 2014, she said, more than 6,000 welfare recipients In Kansas obtained employment. Some of those people now earn enough that they no longer qualify for aid, while others still need some assistance.\n\n\u201cThe policies that we\u2019ve enacted have been effective in helping individuals getting back to work,\u201d Freed said.\n\nBut state Sen. Anthony Hensley, a Democrat from Topeka, said the law is an \u201coverreach.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt harkens to the days of President Ronald Reagan where he talks about the welfare queen that drove a Cadillac,\u201d Hensley said. \u201cThe idea of, \u2018Let\u2019s crack down on the welfare cheats.\u2019 It\u2019s a political game.\n\n\u2018Profound Implications\u2019\n\nKansas is not the first state to pass legislation restricting EBT cards distributed through the Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF) program. At least 23 states have laws on the books restricting or limiting the use of EBT cards, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures (NCSL).\n\nThis year, at least 18 other states (Arizona, Colorado, Connecticut, Illinois, Kentucky, Massachusetts, Maine, Missouri, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Texas, Washington and West Virginia) are considering bills to limit the use of EBT cards, according to Rochelle Finzel, group director for the NCSL (some of those states are considering tweaking existing restrictions).\n\nLouisiana lawmakers imposed restrictions last year after a lingerie shop advertised that it accepted EBT cards.\n\nRelated: 30 Things You Can't Buy on Welfare\n\nThe Louisiana law bars recipients from spending benefit money in tattoo parlors, on psychics, bail bond companies, amusement parks, arcades, jewelry stores, nail salons, cruise ships or any establishment in which children younger than 18 are not admitted. TANF benefits cannot be used for the purchase of tobacco, alcohol, lottery tickets, or jewelry. The law also prohibits proprietors from selling restricted items to EBT users. Casinos and other restricted establishments must disable equipment from accepting EBT cards or face fines. The punishment for violating Louisiana\u2019s rules is harsh, CBPP\u2019s Schott said. A recipient loses benefits for a year for a first violation. A third offense carries permanent disqualification from getting assistance.\n\nThe Kansas law is more restrictive, with profound implications for poor families, said Shannon Cotsoradis, president and CEO for Kansas Action for Children, a child advocacy organization.\n\nNo other state caps daily ATM use. According to Cotsoradis, the $25 limit creates problems for poor families, who usually pay their rent and other bills in cash. In addition, families failing to meet one requirement of the TANF law would be at risk for losing other social safety net benefits, such as child care assistance or food stamps, she said.\n\nRelated: 11 New Tax Laws House Republicans Want to Pass Now\n\nKansas also caps the amount of time a family can spend on welfare. Thanks to welfare reform enacted in 1996 during the Clinton administration, federal law prohibits families from receiving more than 60 months of welfare payments. The Kansas law Gov. Brownback recently signed stops benefits at 36 months.\n\nThe new time limit is the most troubling aspect of the new law, Cotsoradis said. Families living on the edge of poverty tend to cycle in and out of welfare dependency, she said. A parent might get laid off from a job or have reduced work hours in the midst of a recession, or a family member might have a medical emergency. Often, they are not eligible for unemployment insurance. Public assistance helps them get back on their feet quickly, Cotsoradis said.\n\nBased on preliminary numbers from the Department of Children and Family Services, when the law takes effect July 1, 1,012 recipients will lose their benefits because they will have exceeded the time limit.\n\n\u201cThis is the piece of the legislation that will have the most immediate and significant impact on families with children,\u201d Cotsoradis said.\n\nLaws restricting the amount of time a family spends on welfare aren\u2019t effective, according to the Heritage Foundation\u2019s Sheffield. \u201cRelatively few people leave the (welfare) rolls because of a time limit,\u201d she said. Instead, states should focus on enforcing work requirements for able-bodied adults. \u201cThat\u2019s really what we see as most effective.\u201d\n\nRelated: 11 Insanely Overpaid Public Employees\n\nDeep Poverty\n\nPoverty remains an intractable problem in the U.S., the CBPP\u2019s Schott said, but fewer families are actually receiving benefits. Those that do receive aid are finding that it doesn\u2019t go far enough to meet their needs, she said.\n\nAccording to the CBPP, TANF benefits have not kept pace with inflation. In addition, states are spending less TANF money on needy families, according to a CBPP report released earlier this month. (The federal government administers TANF money to states in the form of block grants.) In the 1990s, 70 percent of combined federal and state TANF funds went to basic assistance for poor families. By 2013, 28 percent of those funds went to needy families, the report found. Instead, states have spent a growing share on other areas, such as programs to encourage marriage and discourage out of wedlock births. Sometimes the money is spent on child welfare programs as well.\n\nTo qualify for welfare in Kansas, as well as most states, a family has to be living in deep poverty, according to Heather Hahn, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute. The maximum amount a family of three in Kansas can receive in benefits is $429 a month; most receive much less, Hahn said. Twenty-six percent of poor families in the state receive cash assistance, she said. Adult family members are required to be either working or engaged in \u201cwork activities\u201d to receive the benefits unless a parent is caring for a newborn infant or a disabled family member.\n\n\u201cWe want to create solutions, but the solutions are based on a myth and they don\u2019t solve the real problem,\u201d Hahn said. \u201cIt\u2019s diverting attention from the real problem: Working full-time minimum wage isn\u2019t enough to support a family. People who are trying to play by the rules, who are working and spending their money as wisely as they can, can\u2019t make ends meet without some assistance.\u201d\n\nThis article originally appeared on Stateline\n\nRead more from Stateline:\n\nMost States List Deadly Methadone as a 'Preferred Drug'\n\nCould States Afford Jobless Benefits If Recession Hits?\n\nAttacking Homelessness With 'Rapid Rehousing'", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Kansas\u2019 new", "title": "Why Kansas-Style Welfare Crackdowns May Not Work", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/04/24/Why-Kansas-Style-Welfare-Crackdowns-May-Not-Work", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/07172014_Sam_Brownback_Kansas.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/04/24/Why-Kansas-Style-Welfare-Crackdowns-May-Not-Work", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/07172014_Sam_Brownback_Kansas.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Kansas\u2019 new", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc3cc\"", "article_summary": "\u201cBut this doesn\u2019t get to the heart of what is needed for reform.\u201dRelated: Welfare Crackdown: Kansas Bans Cruises for the PoorFrom Welfare to Work?\nGroups such as the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities (CBPP) have sharply criticized the Kansas law.\nThanks to welfare reform enacted in 1996 during the Clinton administration, federal law prohibits families from receiving more than 60 months of welfare payments.\nTANF benefits cannot be used for the purchase of tobacco, alcohol, lottery tickets, or jewelry.\nLiz Schott, a senior fellow at CBPP, said the law stigmatizes welfare recipients by creating the impression that they are gaming the system."}
