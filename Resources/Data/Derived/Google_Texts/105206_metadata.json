Several women came out of the church after services and exchanged words with the club sympathizers, the newspaper said.\n\nIn a telephone interview Sunday, club owner Thomas George told The Associated Press that four years ago, club dancers in bikinis protested and held signs outside the church, but that didn't stop the church from picketing his business.\n\n\"I don't have a problem with people expressing their First Amendment rights, but at what point does it become harassment,\" said George, who apologized to the public and other churches for Sunday's protest. \"But they backed us in a corner, and we have no recourse at law.\"\n\nHe said judges have repeatedly denied his requests for injunctions to keep church protesters away from his property.\n\nThe church's pastor, the Rev. Bill Dunfee, told the Tribune recently that church members will persist in opposing the club. \"We know what we're doing is working,\" Dunfee said.\n\nDunfee couldn't be reached for comment Sunday. No phone listing for him could be found and a recording at the church said voice mail couldn't accept messages.", "article_metadata": {"article_author": "Associated Press", "medium": "news", "news_keywords": "foxhole-north,new-castle,strip-club", "title": "Strip-club dancers take off tops in heated protest outside Ohio church", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Strip-club dancers take off tops in heated protest outside Ohio church\", \"link\": \"http://www.cleveland.com/nation/index.ssf/2014/08/strip-club_dancers_take_off_tops_in_heated_protest_outside_ohio_church.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://imgick.cleveland.com/home/cleve-media/width620/img/nationworld_impact/photo/ministriespromojpg-f14e9e63cbdc693b.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"13612735\", \"pub_date\": \"2014-08-11T01:35:35Z\", \"author\": \"Associated Press\", \"tags\": [\"foxhole-north\",\"new-castle\",\"strip-club\"] }", "twitter": {"image": "http://media.cleveland.com/nationworld_impact/photo/15591488-thumb_square_large.jpg", "description": "Dancers from Foxhole North, a club in New Castle in central Ohio, staged the protest outside New Beginnings Ministries in nearby Warsaw.", "card": "summary", "site": "@clevelanddotcom"}, "article_date_updated": "Sunday, August 10, 2014,  9:35 PM", "parsely-metadata": "{\"image_url\": \"http://media.cleveland.com/nationworld_impact/photo/ministriespromojpg-f14e9e63cbdc693b.jpg\", \"author_name\": \"cleveap\", \"author_nickname\": \"Associated Press\", \"author_id\": \"1826750\", \"source_blog_name\": \"National News\", \"source_blog_url\": \"http://www.cleveland.com/nation/index.ssf/\", \"sponsored_content\": \"0\" }", "og": {"site_name": "cleveland.com", "description": "Dancers from Foxhole North, a club in New Castle in central Ohio, staged the protest outside New Beginnings Ministries in nearby Warsaw.", "title": "Strip-club dancers take off tops in heated protest outside Ohio church", "url": "http://www.cleveland.com/nation/index.ssf/2014/08/strip-club_dancers_take_off_tops_in_heated_protest_outside_ohio_church.html", "image": "http://media.cleveland.com/design/alpha/img/logo_cleve.gif", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "cleveland.com", "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Sunday, August 10, 2014,  9:23 PM", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "Description": "Dancers from Foxhole North, a club in New Castle in central Ohio, staged the protest outside New Beginnings Ministries in nearby Warsaw."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1fdf\"", "article_summary": "WARSAW, Ohio -- Exotic dancers from an Ohio strip club protested topless outside a church Sunday and engaged in a few heated verbal exchanges with church members.\nDancers from Foxhole North, a club in New Castle in central Ohio, staged the protest outside New Beginnings Ministries in nearby Warsaw, a church the club owner says has protested his business for years, the Coshocton Tribune reported.\nSeveral women came out of the church after services and exchanged words with the club sympathizers, the newspaper said.\nNo phone listing for him could be found and a recording at the church said voice mail couldn't accept messages.\nBill Dunfee, told the Tribune recently that church members will persist in opposing the club."}
