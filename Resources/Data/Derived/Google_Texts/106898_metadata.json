Like elsewhere in the West, water is a precious commodity in this Colorado town, and some residents worry about the potential health hazards of any leaks from wells and drilling.\n\n\u201cNobody wants to live by an oil rig. We surely didn\u2019t want to,\u201d said Joann Jaramillo, 54.\n\nAbout 250 yards up the hill from Jaramillo\u2019s home, on land that was a dormant gravel pit when she bought the house eight years ago, is an active drilling operation that operates every day from 7 a.m. until sometimes 10:30 p.m. Jaramillo said the drilling began about three years ago.\n\nEven if the wells were inspected, she questioned whether that would ensure their safety. She said many view the oil and gas industry as self-policing and nontransparent.\n\n\u201cWho are they going to report to?\u201d she asked.\n\nGovernment data obtained by the AP point to the Bureau of Land Management as so overwhelmed by a boom in a new drilling technique known as hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, that it has been unable to keep up with inspections of some of the highest priority wells. That\u2019s an agency designation based on a greater need to protect against possible water contamination and other environmental and safety issues.\n\nFactors also include whether the well is near a high-pressure formation or whether the drill operator lacks a clear track record of service.\n\n\u201cNo one would have predicted the incredible boom of drilling on federal lands, and the number of wells we\u2019ve been asked to process,\u201d said the BLM\u2019s deputy director, Linda Lance. Since fracking reached a height in 2009, about 90 percent of new wells on federal land are drilled by the process, which involves pumping huge volumes of water, sand and chemicals underground.\n\n\u201cThe current rate of inspections is simply not acceptable to us,\u201d she said.\n\nThe agency oversees 100,000 oil and gas wells on public lands, 3,486 of which received the high priority designation.\n\nAccording to BLM records for fiscal years 2009 to 2012, 1,400 of those high priority wells, spread across 13 states, were not federally inspected. Wyoming had the most, 632, or 45 percent. South Dakota had 1 out of 2 wells uninspected, and Pennsylvania had 1 out of 6.\n\nAll the higher risk wells were inspected in six states \u2013 Alabama, Michigan, Mississippi, New York, Ohio and Texas.\n\nMany more wells are located on private lands, where state officials take the lead in ensuring they comply with environmental laws, with mixed results. Nationwide, there were nearly 500,000 producing gas wells in 2012, according to Energy Information Administration data. More than 1,800 new wells were being drilled in March alone.\n\nDennis Willis, a former BLM field officer in Price, Utah, says he routinely provided input on oil leasing and drilling decisions on federal land before his retirement in 2009. He described a situation of chronic underfunding dating to at least the early 2000s, when BLM management made clear that issuing new permits would be a priority over other tasks, according to a 2002 memorandum from supervisors in Utah to field officers. At the time, fracking was becoming more widely used.\n\n\u201cThere certainly wasn\u2019t a shortage of spills, leaks, pipeline failures and other problems,\u201d said Willis, who now does consulting work for conservation and other groups.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a disaster waiting to happen,\u201d he said.\n\nIn interviews, BLM officials acknowledged persistent problems in keeping up with inspections, but said they were not aware of any major safety issues to date arising from the uninspected wells.\n\nLance said BLM field managers are making judgment calls to minimize the risk of potential harm to surrounding communities. The agency also is reviewing whether it needs to slow down the pace of permits to ensure public safety.\n\nOfficials noted that money provided by Congress for oil and gas operations has declined since 2007. During that period, the number of wells drilled on federal and Indian lands has increased by roughly one-third.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to do the best we can with limited resources,\u201d Lance said.\n\nIf approved by Congress, the BLM\u2019s 2015 budget request of $150 million for oil and gas operations would allow the agency to conduct the bulk of its required inspections over three years, in part by collecting fees from oil and gas companies. Unlike past years, $48 million will be earmarked for inspections. The BLM made similar budget requests the last several years with little success.\n\nThe BLM has sought to add inspectors, but that has proved challenging in places such as Utah, where most wells are drilled on federal land. While a petroleum engineer could get a starting salary of $90,000 in the private sector, the BLM typically pays $35,000. This year\u2019s appropriations bill would allow the BLM to increase inspector salaries to around $44,000.\n\nThe public concern is evident in Colorado, where increased drilling into suburban and rural areas has led community groups to push nearly a dozen oil and gas local control initiatives for the November ballot. Of the wells drilled from 2009-2012, the BLM designated more than 400 on federal and Indian lands in Colorado as high priority, the third highest behind Wyoming and North Dakota. More than 160 of Colorado\u2019s uninspected high-priority wells are near New Castle, on the edge of the White River National Forest.\n\nColorado Gov. John Hickenlooper has been seeking a legislative compromise that could satisfy concerns over health and safety impacts of fracking.\n\nRegulators contend that overall, water and air pollution problems from fracking are rare, but environmental groups and some scientists say there hasn\u2019t been enough research on those issues.\n\nJaramillo said residents in the canyon have mixed feelings about fracking.\n\n\u201cThe people that really like it are the people who are getting money out of it,\u201d she said. \u201cThe people who don\u2019t are really worried about \u2013 Is it going to ruin the water? Is it going to ruin the land? Is it going to ruin the air?\u201d\n\nA neighbor, Kory Kipferl, who owns a 10-acre property adjacent to federal land dotted with active wells on gravel pads. He said he\u2019s accepted what he called a need for domestic drilling \u2013 but he\u2019s concerned about the water table.\n\n\u201cOnce we start puncturing the water table, that could cause problems, whether you\u2019re drilling for gas, oil, water, whatever,\u201d Kipferl said.\n\nThe BLM dataset is more extensive than what was reviewed recently by the Government Accountability Office, and filtered to remove duplicate well entries that yielded an overcount. In a recent report, auditors said the BLM needed to do a better job of coordinating with state regulators. In Pennsylvania, for instance, the one well that went uninspected by the BLM had been checked multiple times by the state.\n\nStill, it\u2019s not clear how willing states are to take up the federal task.\n\n\u201cTo say that we\u2019re going to start inspecting federal wells is just above and beyond what we could do,\u201d said John Rogers, associate director of Utah\u2019s Division of Oil, Gas and Mining, pointing to his small staff. He said companies will inspect their own equipment in order to protect their investment, so it\u2019s likely that at least some of Utah\u2019s 200-plus wells that weren\u2019t inspected by BLM are checked by someone.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re certainly not going to second-guess people\u2019s inspections,\u201d Rogers said of the BLM.\n\n\u2014\n\nThis report was written by Associated Press reporters Hope Yen and Thomas Peipert\n\nYen reported from Washington.
