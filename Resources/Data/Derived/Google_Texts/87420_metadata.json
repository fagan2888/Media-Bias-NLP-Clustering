Mike Ritze, R-Broken Arrow, and six other GOP lawmakers sent a letter to Pruitt criticizing his decision to join Nebraska in asking the high court to invalidate Colorado voters\u2019 2012 determination to legalize marijuana for recreational use.\n\nThey want him to remove Oklahoma from that legal fight, saying he should not meddle in the affairs of another state.\n\n\u201cThis is not about marijuana at its core \u2014 it is about the U.S. Constitution, the 10th Amendment, and the right of states to govern themselves as they see fit,\u201d Ritze said. \u201cIf the Supreme Court can force Colorado to criminalize a substance or activity and commandeer state resources to enforce extra-constitutional federal statutes and U.N. agreements, then it can essentially do anything, and states become mere administrative units for Washington, D.C.\n\n\u201cOur Founding Fathers intended the states to be laboratories of self-government, free to tinker and experiment with different ideas. The founders, from Jefferson to Madison, were also strong proponents of states nullifying unconstitutional federal actions. If the people of Colorado want to end prohibition of marijuana, while I may personally disagree with the decision, constitutionally speaking, they are entitled to do so.\u201d\n\nPruitt said his lawsuit challenges only the portion of Colorado law that affects Oklahoma, the interstate trafficking of marijuana.\n\n\u201cWe will continue to work with the representative and others to ensure this critical distinction is communicated so as to hopefully address any confusion over the lawsuit\u2019s objectives,\u201d Pruitt said Monday. \u201cAs a strong advocate for states\u2019 rights, I can assure the representative that if at any time our lawsuit risks impairment of any states\u2019 rights under the Constitution, I will immediately terminate the lawsuit.\u201d\n\nOklahoma and Nebraska argue that Colorado\u2019s Amendment 64 runs counter to federal law, has created a dangerous gap in the federal drug control system and places an undue burden on neighboring states.\n\nTheir complaint contends they have seen an increase in the amount of Colorado marijuana coming across their borders.\n\nRitze said he has researched the issue, met with state and local law enforcement, and found from numerous sources there is no statistical evidence indicating a significant problem with Colorado marijuana coming across Oklahoma\u2019s border.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re kind of scratching our heads,\u201d Ritze said. \u201cI would like the attorney general to show us where the problem is.\u201d\n\nThe complaint filed with the Supreme Court lists as one article of support the United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances of 1988.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s one of our major concerns, using U.N. treaties to trump states\u2019 rights,\u201d Ritze said.\n\nHe said there may be a way to push legislation to encourage Pruitt to drop the legal action.\n\n\u201cIn a budgetary crisis, now we\u2019re going to go out and spend potentially thousands of dollars on this lawsuit,\u201d Ritze said.\n\n\u201cWe might consider something that would rein in attorney general expenses.\u201d\n\nPruitt has been one of the most active attorneys general in taking on what he describes as federal overreach. He filed the first lawsuit challenging the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, has been a leading advocate of what he calls \u201cthe EPA\u2019s activist agenda,\u201d and is part of a multistate lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of the Dodd-Frank financial law.\n\nOther legislators who signed the letter criticizing Pruitt\u2019s actions on the marijuana law were Rep. Lewis Moore, R-Arcadia; Rep. John Bennett, R-Sallisaw; Rep. Mike Christian, R-Oklahoma City; Rep. Dan Fisher, R-El Reno; Sen. Ralph Shortey, R-Oklahoma City; and Sen. Nathan Dahm, R-Broken Arrow.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Oklahoma Rep.
