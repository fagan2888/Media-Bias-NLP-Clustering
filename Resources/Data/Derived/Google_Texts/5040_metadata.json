The bill is designed to play up a contrast between the two parties on student aid; it\u2019s not going to pass. And ultimately we need to give young people a free or near-free public option for higher education, rather than modestly subsidize the indebtedness that causes delays in major purchases and harm to the economy. But you could certainly do worse than reducing the massive amount of money the government makes off student borrowers (and I don\u2019t think you have to pay for it; an investment in higher ed pays off itself in the long run).\n\nThat\u2019s not how Matthew Chingos of the Brookings Institution sees it. Since Sen. Warren entered public office last year, Chingos has been one of her most persistent critics on higher education issues, calling her proposals \u201cembarrassingly bad\u201d and \u201cnot as progressive as it seems.\u201d Chingos, with his affiliation with a centrist think tank, often gets cited in the media as an objective source in the student loan debate.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s always worth following the money. And Chingos gives you that road map at his own website, where he lists eight research grants he has received, totaling $1.34 million in all, from four several conservative organizations. This includes $500,000 from the Lumina Foundation, which has close ties to Sallie Mae*, the corporation that stands to lose the most from Sen. Warren\u2019s refinancing bill.\n\nThese don\u2019t automatically disqualify Chingos from having views on higher education, but they should inform the debate. Media outlets that freely quote Chingos should disclose his ties to right-wing foundations instead of allowing him to escape with the fa\u00e7ade of an objective profile at the Brookings Institution.\n\nChingos and his colleague Beth Akers began their attacks on Warren last year, when they fulminated against her proposal to temporarily reduce student loan rates to 0.75 percent, the same rate big banks get from the government. The parallel to bank lending was simply meant as a comparison to show what we prioritize in America, but Chingos, like other critics, took it literally, saying that Warren\u2019s \u201cembarrassingly bad proposal \u2026 confuses market interest rates on long-term loans with the Federal Reserve\u2019s discount window.\u201d He added that Warren \u201cdoes not reflect the administrative costs and default risk that increase the costs of the federal student loan program,\u201d which is more a budgetary issue than a higher education one. Chingos and Akers\u2019 disparagement got picked up by the Boston Globe, National Review, the New Republic and New York magazine, always cited to \u201cresearchers at the Brookings Institution.\u201d\n\nWith this year\u2019s proposal on refinancing prior student loans, Chingos and Akers were at it again. In March, they argued that the plan turns student loans into an entitlement, allowing for refinancing at \u201cbelow-market rates.\u201d That\u2019s an odd way of putting it, because the refinancing would actually peg to the agreed-upon 3.86 percent interest rate for this year. And once again, the focus is on cost, hinting at a long-standing debate over how much the government makes off student loans.\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office projects hundreds of billions in profits to the government, but conservatives object to this, favoring a \u201cfair value accounting\u201d method that they claim includes the risk attached to the loans. But the Center for American Progress and former CBO director Robert Reischauer disagree, saying that fair value accounting adds phantom costs that never materialize, and that the government actually prices risk quite well (especially when you consider that borrowers can basically not escape student loan debt).\n\nIf you believe that the government yields record profits off of students, you may want to lower that level of exploitation. If you believe that the government has a right to that expropriation because, like a bank, they have to price the default risk, you would believe, as Chingos does, that relieving the student debt burden is irresponsible and costly, and that the profits \u201caren\u2019t real.\u201d\n\nOnce again, Chingos\u2019 views were presented as non-partisan and objective by the likes of the Boston Globe and Washington Post. Yet a brief look at where Chingos secures his research funds raises questions about that objectivity. The research grants listed on Chingos\u2019 curriculum vitae come from four sources: the Smith Richardson Foundation, the Spencer Foundation, the Laura and John Arnold Foundation and the Lumina Foundation.\n\nThe Smith Richardson Foundation, which gave Chingos $300,000 in grants to support education policy research, has supported right-wing causes for 40 years, including providing key funding to the American Enterprise Institute, a top conservative think tank, since the Reagan administration. The Spencer Foundation, from which Chingos received another $40,000, has similar conservative credentials. *\n\nChingos\u2019 $500,000 in grants from the Laura and John Arnold Foundation supports research on \u201creforming public employee pensions.\u201d Ex-Enron executive Arnold\u2019s crusade to slash public pensions has been well-documented by David Sirota and others. Chingos has been a foot soldier in that war to manufacture a public pension crisis in order to strip public employees of promised benefits.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Matthew Chingos of Brookings hates the senator's student loan plan.
