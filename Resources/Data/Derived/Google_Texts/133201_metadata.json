A mood of scrappy, let-us-at-\u2019em impatience unites such gatherings as Netroots Nation, an annual shindig which this year drew thousands of activists, organisers, bloggers and candidates to Detroit from July 17th-19th. Unfortunately for the broader Democratic Party, the election that inspires the grassroots is the 2016 presidential race. The mid-term congressional elections, which will happen much sooner (in November this year), provoke a more muted response, even though there is a good chance that Republicans will seize the Senate and cripple the rest of Barack Obama\u2019s presidency.\n\nThe kind of people who attend Netroots Nation are passionately and uncompromisingly left wing. Their champion is Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, a former professor who crusades against \u201cbig banks\u201d, \u201cpowerful corporations\u201d and their enablers on the Right. \u201cThe game is rigged,\u201d thundered Ms Warren, whose demands include more generous Social Security benefits (pensions) for the old (paid for with steep tax hikes), cheaper student loans, a higher minimum wage and other forms of redistribution. Not for her the business-friendly centrism of the Clinton clan. Hillary Clinton did not attend Netroots Nation, instead giving a TV interview in which she suggested that a bit of economic growth might make it easier to curb inequality.\n\nSweet dreams are made of this\n\nMs Warren\u2019s warm-up act was Gary Peters, a local congressman who, unlike Ms Warren, is running for election this year. Mr Peters, a moderate ex-banker, is trying to win a Senate seat that Democrats desperately need to win but might not. He could use some grassroots support, but the crowd barely noticed him. They were too happy chanting \u201cRun Liz, Run!\u201d or waving \u201cElizabeth Warren for President\u201d boater-style hats (\u201cthey\u2019re fun, they\u2019re old-timey,\u201d said a hipster handing them out). Ms Warren says she is not running for the White House. No matter. Some 100 days from an election that could condemn Mr Obama to near-impotence, some progressives prefer to daydream about President Warren, \u201cwho won\u2019t stand for all the Wall Street bullshit\u201d, to quote a new (endearingly terrible) folk song by her supporters.\n\nThe Democrats\u2019 footsoldiers can ill afford to daydream in 2014. Even as digital technology transforms elections, recent research shows that flesh-and-blood volunteers tend to trump paid advertising. Candidates need supporters to sway their friends and neighbours. This \u201cground war\u201d is most crucial, for both sides, in the half-dozen swing states where Senate races could go either way. The trouble is, these states are quite conservative. So the Democrats running for office there often have views on guns, coal or fracking that appal progressives, who are therefore reluctant to knock on doors for them.\n\nLike the Republicans with their Tea Party zealots, the Left must choose between purity and pragmatism. MoveOn, a lefty campaign behemoth which claims 8m members, has endorsed only nine Senate candidates so far in this election cycle, conspicuously excluding centrists in tight races in Georgia, Kentucky and Louisiana. The group will \u201csit out\u201d some races; its members have drawn a \u201cbright line\u201d against endorsing senators who voted against increased background checks for gun-owners, for instance. In 2014 that rules out Mark Begich in Alaska and Mark Pryor in Arkansas.\n\nAnother group, the Progressive Change Campaign Committee (PCCC), whose members raised over $2.7m for 2012 candidates, calls itself \u201cthe Elizabeth Warren wing of the Democratic Party\u201d. Its leaders can sound Tea Party-ish, declaring that \u201cideology\u201d matters as much as finding candidates who can win. The PCCC has invested in such hopeless causes as the Senate race in South Dakota to demonstrate the power of \u201canti-corporate\u201d messages delivered by the Democratic candidate there. Several leftish groups think the mid-terms are a chance to show that economic populism is the best way to woo unhappy voters, nationwide.\n\nYet Tea Party parallels are imperfect. Flinty conservatives often scoff that moderate Republicans are no better than Democrats. Progressives are different: many think that Republicans are wicked. That pushes their leaders, at least, towards pragmatism. \u201cWe may have to compromise on some things [to beat the Republicans],\u201d says a boss at Democracy For America (DFA), a group founded by Howard Dean, a former Vermont governor and presidential hopeful who claimed to represent \u201cthe Democratic wing of the Democratic Party\u201d. Take Alaska\u2019s embattled senator. To DFA, Mr Begich has been \u201cterrible\u201d on oil and gas and \u201cnot good\u201d on guns. But he is \u201cfantastic\u201d on inequality. In Louisiana local DFA members are holding their noses and helping a pro-oil Democrat, Senator Mary Landrieu. Ultimately, DFA vows to be \u201call over\u201d any race that might decide the fate of the Senate. Should Democrats lose in 2014, blame candidates \u201cwho didn\u2019t run on expanding Social Security or [raising] the minimum wage,\u201d insists Charles Chamberlain, DFA\u2019s executive director.\n\nBoth DFA and the PCCC plan to use digital wizardry to help members place campaign calls to districts across the country: a nifty trick in places where members despise their own party\u2019s local candidates. MoveOn tells activists that saving the Senate is the \u201cmost important priority\u201d of 2014, reminding them that Mr Obama\u2019s ability to nominate judges is in the balance. Over on the centre-ground, Ready for Hillary, a group working to rally a volunteer army for Mrs Clinton\u2019s use (should she choose to run in 2016), will \u201camplify\u201d any 2014 endorsements made by their heroine, instantly urging supporters to lend a hand to that campaign.\n\nOn current showing, many will ignore such calls to arms in 2014. Despair with Mr Obama and this Congress may be part of the explanation. Progressive footsoldiers are waiting for the scrap that really interests them: a fight to drag the Democratic Party leftwards to victory in 2016. Republicans, who have plenty of problems of their own, cannot believe their luck.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "http://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/50_by_50/imagecache/full-width/images/2014/07/articles/body/20140726_usd111.jpg", "sailthru.flytitle": "Lexington", "description": "Some Democrats haven\u2019t noticed that the next election is this year, not 2016", "pubdate": 20140726, "og": {"site_name": "The Economist", "description": "Some Democrats haven\u2019t noticed that the next election is this year, not 2016", "title": "Dreamy footsoldiers of the Left", "url": "http://www.economist.com/news/united-states/21608759-some-democrats-havent-noticed-next-election-year-not-2016-dreamy", "image": "http://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/full-width/images/2014/07/articles/body/20140726_usd111.jpg", "type": "article"}, "sailthru.rubric": "Some Democrats haven\u2019t noticed that the next election is this year, not 2016", "sailthru.date": "1970-01-01 00:00:00", "sailthru.printdate": "2014-07-26 00:00:00", "revisit-after": "1 day", "sailthru.tags": "Lexington", "fb": {"pages": 6013004059, "app_id": 173277756049645}, "sailthru.imagepath": "images/2014/07/articles/body/20140726_usd111.jpg", "articleid": 21608759, "sailthru.image.full": "http://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/full-width/images/2014/07/articles/body/20140726_usd111.jpg", "sailthru.image.thumb_mfte": "http://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/ec_related_article_image/imagecache/full-width/images/2014/07/articles/body/20140726_usd111.jpg", "sailthru.web_section": "United States", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/theeconomist"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/full-width/images/2014/07/articles/body/20140726_usd111.jpg", "site": "@TheEconomist", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "news_keywords": "Lexington"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8b5e\"", "article_summary": "Progressive footsoldiers are waiting for the scrap that really interests them: a fight to drag the Democratic Party leftwards to victory in 2016.\nIn Louisiana local DFA members are holding their noses and helping a pro-oil Democrat, Senator Mary Landrieu.\nUnfortunately for the broader Democratic Party, the election that inspires the grassroots is the 2016 presidential race.\nTo DFA, Mr Begich has been \u201cterrible\u201d on oil and gas and \u201cnot good\u201d on guns.\nLike the Republicans with their Tea Party zealots, the Left must choose between purity and pragmatism."}
