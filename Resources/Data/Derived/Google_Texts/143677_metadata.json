This argument, while intense and consequential, has often lacked one element: actual knowledge about the size and role of the federal government.\n\nInto this gap, political scientist John DiIulio has thrown a slim volume titled \u201cBring Back the Bureaucrats.\u201d It is a reproof to everyone who hates government or loves government without understanding what it does \u2014 which covers most of the American ideological spectrum.\n\nDiIulio describes two, seemingly contradictory trends. Since the 1960s, federal spending has increased by more than five times in real terms. But the number of federal bureaucrats in 2014 was smaller than at any time since Dwight Eisenhower was in office. The federal workforce has essentially been capped at around 2 million since just after World War II.\n\nSome of this vastly increased level of spending per bureaucrat can be explained by improved productivity -- computers, for example, have made it easier to administer Social Security. But mostly we have seen what DiIulio terms \u201cLeviathan by proxy.\u201d The federal government has expanded its mission without expanding its workforce \u2014 outsourcing the administration of programs to state and local governments; to for-profit businesses (i.e., the military-industrial complex); and to large social service nonprofits. It is, says DiIulio, \u201ca uniquely American, superficially anti-statist form of big government.\u201d\n\nNot all proxies are bad. But the weaknesses of this system were on full display in the launch of the Obamacare exchanges \u2014 in which the reputation of government was tied to the cinderblock of contractor performance and thrown overboard. Hurricane Katrina revealed that the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) is a phantom organization that works mainly through contractors. Our system of government by proxy is often comfortable with high levels of fraud (as in Medicare and Medicaid), and content with low levels of information on outcomes.\n\nAmong political scientists, there is broad agreement on the problems associated with this approach. The recipients of federal funds \u2014 states and localities, for-profit contractors and the independent sector \u2014 are also powerful lobbyists for federal funding (preferably without annoying strings attached). During budget debates, proxies are built-in constituencies for the status quo.\n\nThis system also represents a not-so-subtle form of congressional corruption. Legislators enjoy taking action on popular issues. But they don\u2019t like to raises taxes or to increase the size of the federal workforce. So they fund programs with debt and implement them through proxies. This type of outsourcing is not properly called privatization. Instead, it is the creation of what DiIulio calls \u201ca poorly trained acquisition workforce\u201d that the federal government \u201cstruggles to monitor and manage.\u201d\n\nAs a result, America has a large public sector, but often lacks strong, capable public administration. We have managed to build a big government that is frequently weak.\n\nDiIulio\u2019s main proposed solution is to prune back the proxies and to hire perhaps 1 million more full-time federal civil servants by 2035. It is a policy idea in the best academic tradition \u2014 effectively highlighting the absurdity of our current system while itself being utterly disconnected from political reality.\n\nYet everyone should be upset with the problem DiIulio describes \u2014 both those who prioritize limited government and those who prioritize effective government. Congress has engaged a significant portion of the working public as implementers of federal policy without providing rational systems of oversight and accountability. Simply adding more people to these systems (with some exceptions) would do little to transform them. To be effectively, run they must be made runnable.\n\nSome of this effort should involve the injection of greater rigor into existing and future programs \u2014 what has been called \u201cmoneyball for government.\u201d Instead of spending money, say, on youth development according to the hunches and enthusiasms of politicians, why not require serious evaluation and hold programs accountable for results?\n\nConservatives have something else to offer \u2014 reforms in which providers of services compete for resources by pleasing the people receiving services. Instead of asking the federal government to perform impossible management tasks, why not create systems that handle complexity from the bottom up, allowing for constant marginal improvements? (This is the theory behind school choice and conservative proposals to replace Obamacare.)\n\nThe responses to \u201cLeviathan by proxy\u201d will differ according to ideology. But any serious political movement on the right or left must now be a government reform movement.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://www.newsleader.com/story/opinion/columnists/2015/02/17/bigger-government-means-outsourcing/23542593/", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "We need accountability and capability.", "og": {"site_name": "The News Leader", "description": "We need accountability and capability.", "title": "A bigger government means more outsourcing", "url": "http://www.newsleader.com/story/opinion/columnists/2015/02/17/bigger-government-means-outsourcing/23542593/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/newsleader.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "We need accountability and capability.", "title": "A bigger government means more outsourcing", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/082891afa237cad671c9f253e6d6c091583cd24f/c=48-0-553-505&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/Staunton/2015/02/17/B9316282438Z.1_20150217082559_000_GFB9MG61C.14-0.jpg", "creator": "@newsleadernow", "site": "@newsleadernow", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=858239247", "fb": {"app_id": 169868743049940}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070"}, "article_summary": "The federal workforce has essentially been capped at around 2 million since just after World War II.\nSince the 1960s, federal spending has increased by more than five times in real terms.\nBut they don\u2019t like to raises taxes or to increase the size of the federal workforce.\nBut the number of federal bureaucrats in 2014 was smaller than at any time since Dwight Eisenhower was in office.\nThis argument, while intense and consequential, has often lacked one element: actual knowledge about the size and role of the federal government."}
