LAS VEGAS (AP) — A Las Vegas high-rise hotel has reopened its rooftop swimming pool a day after a fire sent patrons running and black smoke billowing above the Strip.

The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas says the Bamboo Pool on the 14th floor reopened at 10 a.m. with full service except for its West Bar.

Hotel officials said in a statement that an area affected by the fire has been walled off by the Clark County Fire Department.

A spa, fitness center and the 15th floor of the hotel’s West End Tower are also open.

However, guest rooms on the 14th floor are still closed.

Crews were called to the resort around 12:15 p.m. Saturday to reports of a fire by an outdoor pool.

Two people were treated for smoke inhalation.
