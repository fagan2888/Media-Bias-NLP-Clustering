Richard Burr Richard BurrThe Trail 2016: Hell breaks loose Burr, Ross in statistical dead heat in NC Senate race Senate panel advances spy policy bill, after House approves its own version MORE (R-N.C.) and Dianne Feinstein Dianne FeinsteinClinton\u2019s email troubles deepen Top Dem: CIA officials thought spying on Senate \u2018was flat out wrong\u2019 Senate panel advances spy policy bill, after House approves its own version MORE (D-Calif.) \u2014 the Intelligence Committee\u2019s leaders \u2014 said a briefing is in the works, but that some particulars may be kept classified.\n\nThe FBI has already informed both Burr and Feinstein about its hacking tactics.\n\n\u201cI think that the important thing for the committee,\" Burr said, is learning the method fit \"within the letter of the law.\"\n\n\"The sensitivity of it may dictate that there\u2019s less specifics communicated to members than more,\u201d he added, leaving a committee meeting on Thursday.\n\nAny attempt to withhold information could frustrate FBI critics, such as Wyden, who believe the agency was using the emotionally-charged terror case in San Bernardino to set a precedent that would allow investigators to access other locked devices.\n\nIn February, the FBI said it was impossible to crack shooter Syed Rizwan Farook\u2019s iPhone without Apple\u2019s help, and took the tech giant to court to make it unlock the phone.\n\nBut the agency surprisingly reversed course in late March, announcing that it been shown a novel hacking tactic not requiring Apple\u2019s assistance. The Justice Department subsequently dropped its case.\n\nCapitol Hill critics such as Wyden say the whiplash highlights the FBI\u2019s ever-changing position on encryption.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time for the FBI and the DOJ to stop throwing spaghetti against the wall and hoping something will stick,\u201d Wyden said in a Medium post Thursday.\n\nIn a separate case in Brooklyn, the FBI on Friday said it will continue to seek Apple\u2019s help in unlocking the iPhone of a convicted drug trafficker. The decision shows that the courtroom battle over government access to encrypted devices is far from over.\n\nThe Obama administration, Wyden said, \u201chas had trouble being straight with the American people about what it wants.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not just Wyden and FBI critics that wants more details on the iPhone hack. The bureau\u2019s backers believe the agency should be talking to the Intelligence panel.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s important for the Intelligence Committee to understand some of this, yes,\u201d Feinstein told reporters this week. \u201cBut I think parts of it should remain classified.\u201d\n\nFeistein is working with Burr on a bill that would allow the FBI to force companies like Apple to provide \u201ctechnical assistance\u201d to the FBI when it requests encrypted data.\n\nOther Intel panel members, such as Sen. Angus King Angus KingSenators to Obama: Make 'timely' call on Afghan troops levels Lawmakers push to elevate Cyber Command in Senate defense bill House, Senate at odds on new authority for cyber war unit MORE (I-Maine), told The Hill they\u2019re interested in whatever the FBI is able to offer.\n\n\u201cI suppose it\u2019s always good to have information, so we\u2019ll see what they tell us,\u201d King said this week.\n\nOutside the Intelligence panel, Sen. Tom Carper Tom CarperFinancial industry spars with retailers over data breach bill Week ahead: Cyber Command in the spotlight Lawsuit exposes M cybertheft through banking software MORE (Del.), the Senate Homeland Security Committee\u2019s top Democrat, said he has also reached out to the FBI about how it cracked Farook\u2019s phone.\n\nBurr indicated that his briefing didn\u2019t include a complete technical run-down, perhaps giving a preview of what other senators might learn.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure that the committee or the chairman, or the vice chairman, will know exactly how it was accessed,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Sen.
