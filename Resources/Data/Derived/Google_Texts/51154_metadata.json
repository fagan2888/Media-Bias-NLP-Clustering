That message came from Dan Payne, a senior counterintelligence official for the Director of National Intelligence.\n\n\u201cSome of you may think that you are not of interest because you don\u2019t have access to classified information,\u201d he said. \u201cYou are mistaken.\u201d\n\nFederal officials said Friday the cyberattack appeared to have originated in China, but they didn\u2019t point fingers directly at the Chinese government. The Chinese said any such accusation would be \u201cirresponsible and unscientific.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe know that the attack occurred from somewhere in China, but we don\u2019t know whether it was an individual or a group or a nation-state attack,\u201d said Rep. Jim Langevin, a Rhode Island Democrat and leading voice in Congress on cybersecurity. He added, though that it had \u201call the hallmarks of a nation-state attack.\u201d\n\nWhite House spokesman Josh Earnest said he couldn\u2019t divulge much while the case was under investigation. Still, he noted that investigators \u201care aware of the threat that is emanating from China.\u201d\n\nOne U.S. official said the breach of data involving more than 4 million past and present federal workers was being investigated as a national security matter. That suggests authorities believe a nation was behind it rather than a more loosely organized gang of cybercriminals. The official was not authorized to discuss an ongoing investigation and spoke only on condition of anonymity.\n\nThe breach was an embarrassing showing for the U.S. government\u2019s vaunted computer-defense system for civilian agencies \u2014 dubbed \u201cEinstein\u201d \u2014 which is costing $376 million this year alone. It\u2019s supposed to detect unusual Internet traffic that might reflect hacking attempts or stolen data being transmitted outside the government.\n\nA wide range of information is prized by spies \u2014 classified military secrets but also economic strategy and internal foreign policy debates.\n\nThis latest breach occurred in December but wasn\u2019t discovered until April, officials say. It was made public Thursday.\n\n\u201cThe scale of it is just staggering,\u201d said Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee. There\u2019s no telling how many more attacks could be spawned by the information stolen in this case, he said.\n\nAlthough most Americans think of identity thieves stealing from credit card or bank accounts, the information about civilian federal workers has other value for spies.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re able to identify people who are in positions with access to significant national security information and can use personal data to target those individuals,\u201d said Payne, the counterintelligence official.\n\nHe said details from personnel files could be used to craft personalized phony messages to trick workers. Federal employees who think they\u2019re opening an email from co-workers or family members might infect their computers with a program that would steal more information or install spy software.", "article_metadata": {"description": "After hacking, government workers warned of potential fraud", "title": "After hacking, government workers warned of potential fraud", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "After hacking, government workers warned of potential fraud", "title": "After hacking, government workers warned of potential fraud", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/06/06/after_hacking_government_workers_warned_of_potential_fraud/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/06/einstein-hack.jpeg.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "After hacking, government workers warned of potential fraud", "title": "After hacking, government workers warned of potential fraud", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/06/einstein-hack.jpeg.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Ted Bridis, Ken Dilanian and Eric Tucker", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd73b\"", "article_summary": "It\u2019s supposed to detect unusual Internet traffic that might reflect hacking attempts or stolen data being transmitted outside the government.\nThere\u2019s no telling how many more attacks could be spawned by the information stolen in this case, he said.\nAlthough most Americans think of identity thieves stealing from credit card or bank accounts, the information about civilian federal workers has other value for spies.\nHe said details from personnel files could be used to craft personalized phony messages to trick workers.\n\u201cSome of you may think that you are not of interest because you don\u2019t have access to classified information,\u201d he said."}
