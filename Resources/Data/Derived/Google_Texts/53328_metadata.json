'We should move toward protecting the rule of law, protecting our border, making legal immigration easier than illegal immigration for sure, but we also want to look at this as a huge opportunity.'\n\nSaid Bush: 'The conservative cause would be better to embrace this rather than push it away.'\n\nBush was in the territory for a fundraising event and town hall meeting with Republicans.\n\nHe is expected to announce his candidacy for the Republican nomination, joining Sens. Marco Rubio of Florida, Rand Paul of Kentucky and Ted Cruz of Texas, as well as many other prospective rivals, in the race.\n\nHe wasn't ready to make that announcement Tuesday.\n\nOn his Hispanic ties, he said: 'I know about the immigrant experience because I married a beautiful girl from Mexico. My children are bicultural and bilingual.' His wife, Columba, is from Mexico\n\nPuerto Rico's Republican Party leader, Carlos Mendez, leaned forward at one point and passed on an index card with the question everyone was wondering: 'Are you going to run for president?'\n\nBush laughed and said, 'I'm on the journey of considering that, trying to figure out if I have the support necessary to do it. Today's not the day to trigger a campaign but I appreciate the sentiment.'\n\nIn large measure, Bush's purpose seemed to be to make a cultural connection on the island where he came to campaign for his father in Puerto Rico's first primary.\n\n'I learned how to organize intensely here,' he said. 'I learned the passion. I learned how to drink a lot of Puerto Rican rum.'\n\nAnd on his Hispanic ties, he smiled and said: 'I know about the immigrant experience because I married a beautiful girl from Mexico. My children are bicultural and bilingual.'\n\nHis wife, Columba, is from Mexico.\n\nHis remarks impressed Naomi Rodriguez, a 21-year-old economics and finance major. 'I like the fact that he's bilingual,' she said, as well as his words on statehood. 'When that happens, a lot of things could change and it will likely be beneficial for us,' she said.\n\nBush also expressed support for giving Puerto Rico the right to file for bankruptcy under Chapter 9.\n\nThe island of 3.6 million people has been in a recession for eight years and is struggling with a $73 billion public debt load, with many U.S. investors concerned that some public agencies including the Electric Energy Authority could soon go bankrupt.\n\nAn earlier move to let the island's agencies restructure was struck down by a federal judge.", "article_metadata": {"Rating": "General", "news_keywords": "Jeb,Bush,declares,support,Puerto,Rico,51st,state,says,knows,immigrant,experience,married,beautiful,girl,Mexico", "original-source": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3059651/Jeb-Bush-declares-support-Puerto-Rico-51st-state-says-knows-immigrant-experience-married-beautiful-girl-Mexico.html", "doc-class": "Living Document", "twitter": {"description": "The former Florida governor and 2016 GOP presidential prospect delivered a speech on economic opportunities peppered with Spanish.", "title": "Jeb Bush supports Puerto Rico becoming 51st US state", "url": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3059651/Jeb-Bush-declares-support-Puerto-Rico-51st-state-says-knows-immigrant-experience-married-beautiful-girl-Mexico.html", "app": {"id": {"ipad": 400442503, "iphone": 384101264}}, "image": "http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2015/04/28/21/281C493000000578-0-image-a-33_1430251751817.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "account_id": 15438913}, "robots": "noodp,noydir,all,noarchive", "al": {"android": {"url": "dailymail-fb://article/3059651/", "app_name": "Daily Mail Online", "package": "com.dailymail.online"}, "ios": {"url": "dailymail-fb://article/3059651/", "app_store_id": 384101264, "app_name": "MailOnline"}}, "msvalidate.01": "12E6B4B813EB44C9BFC8F6A21F1D01F5", "fb": {"app_id": 146202712090395}, "MSSmartTagsPreventParsing": "true", "articleid": 3059651, "divclasspage": "articlePage", "keywords": "Jeb,Bush,declares,support,Puerto,Rico,51st,state,says,knows,immigrant,experience,married,beautiful,girl,Mexico", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/DailyMail", "published_time": "2015-04-28T20:23:58.000Zyyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss z", "author": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/search.html?s=&authornamef=Jill+Reilly+For+Dailymail.com", "section": "News", "modified_time": "2015-05-24T07:20:21.000Zyyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss z", "tag": "Jeb Bush declares support Puerto Rico 51st state says knows immigrant experience married beautiful girl Mexico"}, "verify-v1": "DXwlrsxbqxSv+FTFkWUfgflBvFJfx2YbNf/HmABrVyY=", "y_key": "1a7e912afbfcab2f", "og": {"site_name": "Mail Online", "description": "The former Florida governor and 2016 GOP presidential prospect delivered a speech on economic opportunities peppered with Spanish.", "title": "Jeb Bush supports Puerto Rico becoming 51st US state", "url": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3059651/Jeb-Bush-declares-support-Puerto-Rico-51st-state-says-knows-immigrant-experience-married-beautiful-girl-Mexico.html", "image": {"width": 636, "identifier": "http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2015/04/28/21/281C493000000578-0-image-a-33_1430251751817.jpg", "height": 382}, "type": "article"}, "channel": "News", "description": "The former Florida governor and 2016 GOP presidential prospect delivered a speech on economic opportunities peppered with Spanish."}, "article_summary": "Jeb Bush reaffirmed the idea for Puerto Rico statehood on Tuesday during a visit to Puerto Rico, winning great applause.\nBush also expressed support for giving Puerto Rico the right to file for bankruptcy under Chapter 9.\nPuerto Rico has held four non-binding referendums on the issue, with statehood never garnering a clear majority.\nHe's fluent in the language, and often uses it in Florida, but it's rarely heard in Republican presidential campaign politics.\n'To get the full benefits and responsibilities of citizenship, being a state is the only way to make that happen.'"}
