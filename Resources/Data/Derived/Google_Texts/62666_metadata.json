Legislators have shot down the previous attempts.\n\n\u201cWe know national Republicans are against the ACA. It has spilled over into Louisiana,\u201d said state Rep. Katrina Jackson, who chairs the black caucus\n\nJackson\u2019s remarks followed a Black Caucus sponsored prayer breakfast attended by about 400 politicians and pastors.\n\nSeveral bills have been filed in the legislative session that began last week to accomplish that goal.\n\nGov. Bobby Jindal opposes Medicaid expansion, arguing that despite lucrative federal incentives for adding more people to the government insurance program, eventually Louisiana taxpayers will have to start paying toward its cost. He also argues that the expansion builds on what he calls a broken health care system.\n\nBut none of that was discussed when Jindal appeared at the prayer breakfast.\n\nHe kept his short talk to religious themes, not even delving into the controversial \u201creligious freedom\u201d legislation that the governor has backed. Instead he talked about prayer.\n\n\u201cIt is great to come together with legislators, pastors and members of the community to pray for our state and for God\u2019s guidance as we enter the legislative session,\u201d Jindal said.\n\nHe spoke of \u201cUnion, Confidence, Justice,\u201d which is the state\u2019s motto.\n\n\u201cUnion, because we are unified in the love of God and in the love we have for our state,\u201d Jindal said. Confidence because God gives people the spirit of power and love. \u201cAnd justice because we are all created by God and equal under the law, and I commend the Caucus for their pursuit of justice each day.\u201d\n\nAnd Jackson, D-Monroe, said she didn\u2019t discuss issues Jindal because the event was not political. This is the third black caucus prayer breakfast Jindal has addressed.\n\nAfter the plates of scrambled eggs and grits were cleared, the pastors and Jindal had left, Jackson and other members of the black caucus outlined their agenda for the legislative session that began last week and continues until 6 p.m. on June 11.\n\nThe black caucus is backing legislation to raise the minimum wage and to loosen laws requiring harsh prison terms for relatively minor offenses.\n\nBut they will place special emphasis on getting the Jindal administration and the majority of their fellow lawmakers to reverse course and expand the state\u2019s Medicaid rolls.\n\nState Rep. Marcus Hunter, D-Monroe, said the difference between this legislative session and previous years is the economic pressures caused by a $1.6 billion shortfall in expected revenues. Legislators with both parties are concerned that the only alternative to not finding new revenues is deep, deep cuts in higher education and health care.\n\nUnder Medicaid expansion, the federal government would pay hundreds of millions of dollars over several years, if the state would change its eligibility requirements and allow the working poor to join the million-plus residents on the government health plan.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s absolutely an economic issue,\u201d Hunter said.\n\nFollow Mark Ballard on Twitter @MarkBallardCNB.
