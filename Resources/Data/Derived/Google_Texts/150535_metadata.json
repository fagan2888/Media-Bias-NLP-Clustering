But it also drew a White House veto threat as well as a predicted blockage by Democrats in the Senate.\n\nIn the House as well as the Senate - and including Attorney General Loretta Lynch's own testimony to the House last week - Democrats have said the refugees should be allowed because the U.S. already has a 'robust' screening system that can take up to two years to complete for any one single person.\n\nThursday's bill urges House Speaker Paul Ryan and other GOP leaders to include a provision in an upcoming appropriations bill that would block President Barack Obama's plan to accept 10,000 Syrian refugees in the next year.\n\nIt would represent a major test for Ryan, who has repeated multiple times in multiple national TV interviews that the government funding bill is one of the few areas on which he predicts he and Obama can work together outside of partisan politics.\n\nPresident Barack Obama will certainly disagree to dismantle his signature domestic achievement - the 2010 Affordable Care Act health care law - but also wants to continue to fund the federal government beyond Dec. 11, when a stopgap funding measure runs out\n\nRyan's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the letter, which argued that Congress must \"exercise greater authority\" over the refugee resettlement program to ensure the safety of the U.S. public.\n\n'ISIS (Islamic State) has repeatedly declared that they would infiltrate the refugee community that is leaving the Middle East and flooding into Europe. The November 13 attacks in Paris appear to have been a fulfillment of that threat,' the letter said.\n\nIn the Senate, Republicans are planning yet another push to obliterate Obama's cherished health care law - the 2010 Affordable Care Act - and block $450 million in annual federal funds to Planned Parenthood.\n\nThe Planned Parenthood funding became a lightning rod for social conservatives this year after secretly recorded videos surfaced over the summer that showed agency officials allegedly discussing harvesting fetal tissue.\n\nThe group denied any wrongdoing, but congressional Republicans are continuing to investigate.\n\nDespite the certain Obama veto waiting for any Obamacare repeal or de-funding Planned Parenthood efforts, Republicans see the congressional votes as a way to signal their endorsement of the conservative causes.\n\nThe path is tricky in the Senate, however, since the chamber was inherently designed to give more weight to the minority party - currently Democrats - than the House.\n\nIt also drips with presidential politics, as three GOP senators - Rand Paul of Kentucky, Ted Cruz of Texas and Marco Rubio of Florida - are vying for the 2016 Republican nomination for president, and therefore eager to show off their conservative credentials to primary voters.\n\nSince Obama will remain in the White House until January 2017, the votes also send the not-so-subtle message that the goals could be achieved if Republicans win the 2016 election.\n\nFor Senate passage, Republicans will likely turn to a complex legislative tactic that allows a simple Senate majority of 51 votes to pass a bill instead of the usual 60 required to overcome a filibuster.\n\nThere are currently 54 Republicans in the Senate. However, for the tactic to be considered allowable by the Senate parliamentarian, it must reduce the federal budget deficit. That means an Obamacare repeal may be off the table because the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office has said repealing the health care law would actually increase the deficit by $350 billion over the next 10 years.\n\nCruz is one of the few Senate Republicans who could prove to be a stumbling block to the GOP's wish list for Christmas\n\nRubio could also hold an important card in the all-critical Christmas sweepstakes that will unfold after Thanksgiving\n\nRemaining options are to repeal certain provisions of the health law to undermine it, including its fines against individuals who lack coverage and employers who don't offer it to workers.\n\nOther parts of the law would conceivably remain intact, including some for which repeal would anger voters and jeopardize GOP incumbents' re-election prospects in competitive states like Ohio, Pennsylvania and Illinois.\n\nThat includes the statute's expansion of Medicaid and its federal subsidies for lower-earning people buying health coverage.\n\nSenate leaders haven't finished crafting their legislation, and will tailor it to attract votes. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., has said it will include an Obamacare repeal and a halt to Planned Parenthood's money.\n\nBut some GOP senators reluctant to bar Planned Parenthood's funds might vote 'no.' Moderate Sen. Susan Collins of Maine says she's 'concerned' about the language, and Sens. Mark Kirk of Illinois, Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire and Alaska's Lisa Murkowski \u2014 all facing close re-election contests next year \u2014 might find the decision difficult.\n\nOn the other hand, three conservative Republicans said last month that the House measure 'simply isn't good enough.' Presidential hopefuls Cruz of Texas and Rubio of Florida, as well as Utah's Mike Lee, said they'd oppose the bill unless it 'fully repeals Obamacare pursuant to Senate rules.'", "article_metadata": {"Rating": "General", "news_keywords": "Many,U,S,House,Republicans,want,refugee,restrictions,spending,bill", "original-source": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3332494/Many-U-S-House-Republicans-want-refugee-restrictions-spending-bill.html", "doc-class": "Living Document", "twitter": {"description": "A fight is brewing - and quickly - as congressional Republicans who see an opportunity to press their priorities into a must-pass government spending bill that Congress will take up after Thanksgiving.", "title": "Many U.S. House Republicans want refugee restrictions in spending bill", "url": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3332494/Many-U-S-House-Republicans-want-refugee-restrictions-spending-bill.html", "app": {"id": {"ipad": 400442503, "iphone": 384101264}}, "image": "http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2015/11/24/22/2EC836D100000578-0-image-a-11_1448404218183.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "account_id": 15438913}, "robots": "noodp,noydir,all,noarchive", "al": {"android": {"url": "dailymail-fb://article/3332494/", "app_name": "Daily Mail Online", "package": "com.dailymail.online"}, "ios": {"url": "dailymail-fb://article/3332494/", "app_store_id": 384101264, "app_name": "MailOnline"}}, "msvalidate.01": "12E6B4B813EB44C9BFC8F6A21F1D01F5", "fb": {"app_id": 146202712090395}, "MSSmartTagsPreventParsing": "true", "articleid": 3332494, "divclasspage": "articlePage", "keywords": "Many,U,S,House,Republicans,want,refugee,restrictions,spending,bill", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/DailyMail", "published_time": "2015-11-24T19:58:43.000Zyyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss z", "author": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/search.html?s=&authornamef=J.+Taylor+Rushing,+U.s.+Political+Reporter,+For+Dailymail.com", "section": "News", "modified_time": "2015-11-24T23:01:16.000Zyyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss z", "tag": "Many U S House Republicans want refugee restrictions spending bill"}, "verify-v1": "DXwlrsxbqxSv+FTFkWUfgflBvFJfx2YbNf/HmABrVyY=", "y_key": "1a7e912afbfcab2f", "og": {"site_name": "Mail Online", "description": "A fight is brewing - and quickly - as congressional Republicans who see an opportunity to press their priorities into a must-pass government spending bill that Congress will take up after Thanksgiving.", "title": "Many U.S. House Republicans want refugee restrictions in spending bill", "url": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3332494/Many-U-S-House-Republicans-want-refugee-restrictions-spending-bill.html", "image": {"width": 636, "identifier": "http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2015/11/24/22/2EC836D100000578-0-image-a-11_1448404218183.jpg", "height": 382}, "video": {"width": 636, "identifier": "http://video.dailymail.co.uk/video/bc/rtmp_uds/1418450360/2015/06/25/1418450360_4321448194001_4321257930001.mp4", "type": "video/mp4", "height": 358}, "type": "article"}, "channel": "News", "description": "A fight is brewing - and quickly - as congressional Republicans who see an opportunity to press their priorities into a must-pass government spending bill that Congress will take up after Thanksgiving."}, "article_summary": "In exchange, the White House would get the continued funding of the U.S. government beyond Dec. 11, when a current stopgap funding bill expires.\nCongressional Republicans have a healthy early-Christmas wish list on Capitol Hill - the end of Obamacare, at least a temporary end to incoming Syrian refugees, and no more federal funding for Planned Parenthood.\nBut it also drew a White House veto threat as well as a predicted blockage by Democrats in the Senate.\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., has said it will include an Obamacare repeal and a halt to Planned Parenthood's money.\nIn the Senate, Republicans are planning yet another push to obliterate Obama's cherished health care law - the 2010 Affordable Care Act - and block $450 million in annual federal funds to Planned Parenthood."}
