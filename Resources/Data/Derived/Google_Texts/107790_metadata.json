Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.) and Rob Portman (R-Ohio), the ranking Democrat and chairman, respectively, of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs subcommittee on investigations, are now demanding a full briefing from the Army Contracting Command about all its contracts with Imperatis, which over time have totaled nearly $1 billion.\n\nIn a letter Tuesday to the agency\u2019s Commanding General Theodore Harrison, McCaskill and Portman highlighted the previous issues with the firm after which, they wrote, the company assured them it \u201chad taken action to ensure that there was no further misconduct by Jorge Scientific employees in Afghanistan.\u201d\n\n\u201cAfter allegations of frequent drug and alcohol abuse, bar brawls, and out-of-control parties among its employees in Afghanistan, this contractor is now facing additional scrutiny into its business practices to the possible tune of more than $130 million in taxpayer dollars, and we intend to get to the bottom of it,\u201d McCaskill said in an e-mail to the Loop.\n\nRelated: Is State Trying to Muzzle Afghanistan Watchdog?\n\nThe Army uses Imperatis to provide counterinsurgency intelligence training for Afghan security forces through its Legacy Easy Project. In 2012, two former employees filed a complaint that there was rampant use of drugs and alcohol by then-Jorge Scientific personnel in Afghanistan. They took cellphone video of wasted employees that they gave to ABC News, which first reported the story.\n\nAfter that story broke, McCaskill wrote to Secretary of the Army John McHugh asking for a review of Jorge Scientific\u2019s contracts. She received a response that the Army was looking into it, and had subsequent briefings. She was assured everyone involved had been fired and there would be more oversight.\n\nImperatis has responded forcefully to the recent independent audit, asking that the findings be reconsidered or that SIGAR \u201cprovide more time and funding to complete the audit.\u201d\n\nMore funding?\n\nThis article originally appeared in The Washington Post\n\nRead More at The Washington Post\n\nSenate reaches deal to move fast track trade authority\n\nOn the Trail, Jeb Faces Hostile Questions About Iraq War\n\nWhy is Funding Amtrak Such a Struggle?
