A Michigan man who robbed a local credit union reportedly did so in a desperate attempt to help pay for his daughter’s chemotherapy, according to authorities, ABC News reports .

Brian Randolph, 23, is accused of entering the Vibe Credit Union in South Lyon earlier this month and passing a note demanding money. The note said that he had a gun hidden in his clothes, but Randolph reportedly never showed a firearm and, according to the authorities, did not actually have a gun with him.

The young father has been charged with armed robbery. His bond was set at $500,000.

According to ABC News, Randolph’s troubles began when his insurance company reportedly stopped paying for his daughter’s chemotherapy treatment. Brailynn, who is 1 year old, has retinoblastoma, a cancer that forms in the eye, and needs treatment every four weeks that costs thousands of dollars, the site notes.

Randolph told the authorities that it was a last-ditch attempt to get money for Brailynn's upcoming session.

"I guess it was desperation. Time was ticking right before her actual appointment came up," Brailynn's mother, Asia Dupree, told WXYZ-TV. "This was after the insurance was canceled. ... [We] kept calling. No answer. Voicemails. No answer. No callbacks.”
