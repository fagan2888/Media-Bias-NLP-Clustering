A 61 percent majority oppose sending ground troops to fight in Iraq or Syria, which Obama has ruled out.\n\nJust 37 percent, though, say they approve of the way Obama is handling ISIS.\n\nThis discrepancy has been playing out in response to foreign policy conflicts throughout the year: In April, YouGov polling found that Americans were nearly twice as likely to support sanctions against Ukraine as they were to approve of Obama's actions after he imposed them. In June, a CBS/New York Times survey found Democrats five times more likely than Republicans to approve of Obama's handling of Iraq, even though an identical 54 percent in both parties backed his decision to send military advisers into the country.\n\nThat partisan split hints to one of the reasons for the disparity. Not everyone follows foreign policy all that closely: Nearly a third of Americans think the U.S. has bombed Syria recently, and nearly a quarter were willing to opine on nonexistent legislation addressing Ukraine. In the absence of extensive knowledge of U.S. military actions, many end up relying on other cues, like partisanship -- in the most recent CNN/ORC poll, Democrats were nearly six times more likely than Republicans to say Obama was doing a good job handling ISIS.\n\nEven among his base, though, the recent string of foreign policy crises may present something of a no-win situation: while 78 percent of Democrats approve of Obama's overall job as president, just 64 percent approve of his actions toward ISIS, with nearly a third disapproving.\n\nCNN surveyed 1,014 Americans between Sept. 5 and Sept. 7, using live interviewers to reach both landlines and cell phones.\n\nAlso on HuffPost: Clashes in Iraq Clashes in Iraq\n\n1 of 28 Gunmen patrol during clashes with Iraqi security forces in Fallujah, Iraq in this Jan. 5, 2014 picture.
