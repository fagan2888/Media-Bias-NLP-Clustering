This has not been adequately tested. There is no research. It is based upon one paper written by one doctor who is obviously a fanatic. Needless to say the medical professionals in Arizona are appalled. Ill-informed politicians are reaching once again into their offices and examining rooms and requiring them to pass on dangerous and erroneous information to their patients.\n\nAnd at the same time the right is telling doctors what they are required to tell their patients about abortion, they are passing laws requiring them not to talk about other things. Think Progress had this from Texas last month:\n\nUnder a proposed bill currently being considered in Texas, doctors wouldn\u2019t be allowed to ask their patients whether there are any firearms in their homes \u2014 and could be subject to punishment from the Texas Medical Board if they do initiate any conversations about gun safety in the office. The lawmaker who\u2019s sponsoring the measure, Rep. Stuart Spitzer (R), is backed by the National Rifle Association and the Texas State Rifle Association. He believes that the federal government is inappropriately reaching into doctors\u2019 offices to figure out who owns gun\n\nThat\u2019s correct. They are proposing to censor doctors from speaking to their patients about gun violence. And their ostensible reason for doing this is because the federal government in reaching into doctors\u2019 offices. It\u2019s hard to believe their brains didn\u2019t explode from the dissonance.\n\nAnd Representative Spitzer\u2019s rationale is almost as ludicrous as the old John Birth Society \u201cCommies put fluoride in the water\u201d theory:\n\n\u201cPediatricians are asking children away from their parents, \u2018Do you have guns in your house?\u2019 and then reporting this on the electronic health records, and then the federal government, frankly, has access to who has guns and who doesn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nClearly, the federal government\u2019s real agenda is to engage in a clandestine sweep of pediatricians\u2019 young patients\u2019 electronic medical records to determine whose parents have guns. And then obviously they are planning to send in the jack-booted thugs to confiscate them. So in order to stop such a terrible overreach of state power, the \u201clet\u2019s get government out of our lives\u201d people are no longer just interfering with doctors who treat the elderly and women but now they must interfere with how they treat children as well. Evidently, their vaunted fealty toward individual rights does not extend to the examining table.(And if there\u2019s one place I think most Americans would really like to have some individual rights and privacy it\u2019s there\u2026)\n\nThe reason the American Medical Association recommends that doctors talk to their patients about gun safety is because NRA, which used to consider that its primary goal, is so devoted to collecting money from its members, lobbying on behalf of gun manufacturers and flooding the streets of America with as many deadly weapons as possible it no longer wants to do this job. This isn\u2019t a back-door attempt to make firearms illegal. That would quixotic in the extreme. It\u2019s an attempt to cut back on the huge numbers of tragic gun accidents in this country \u2014 something which nobody is out there defending, not even the NRA. (If someone\u2019s saying that we all have a constitutional right to accidentally shoot people, I haven\u2019t heard it.)\n\nResearchers are trying to gather statistics on gun violence and that is seen as an assault on gun rights, something which has long been blocked by the NRA and their minions in the congress. Only a very insecure movement would be afraid of such data. It carries no meaning in itself, it\u2019s just numbers and observation. After centuries of debate the Supreme Court finally declared the 2nd Amendment to mean that an individual has a right to bear arms and that is highly unlikely to be reversed. They can relax about that. Information won\u2019t kill them. A gun accident might, however, and it\u2019s downright nihilistic to believe that trying to prevent them through education and research must be stopped, especially by preventing doctors from discussing it with their patients.\n\nLiberals are often accused by the freedom-loving right of having a Stalinist worldview in which they seek to impose their view on others by force. But if that\u2019s true, the right has now become what they most despise. These days they are using government to intrude on the most personal and private of medical matters, dictating not only what what medical professionals are allowed to do but what they are allowed to say to their patients. Reconciling this with their alleged blind fealty to the Constitution is quite a stretch. But then they have always had a rather selective view of the Bill of Rights. The first Amendment protects their freedom of religion and their freedom of speech. Others not so much. The Fourth Amendment only applies to citizens who\u2019ve earned it. Indeed, only the Second is sacrosanct. In fact, they\u2019ve taken to making it into a sort of \u201cSuper-Amendment\u201d with their fatuous slogan \u201cThe Second Amendment is what guarantees the First.\u201d\n\nAnd it\u2019s true. For the gun owner. An armed person is definitely more free to speak in America than one who isn\u2019t. Sure the right exists in the abstract for all of us. But in a country where people gun down drivers for honking their horn or parking in the wrong spot, let\u2019s just say that in practice it\u2019s becoming risky to say or do anything that might set someone off. It\u2019s not a more polite society, it\u2019s a more paranoid one. And in order to protect that Super-Amendment for gun owners, they are now enlisting government to infringe the rights of doctors and their patients and people who disagree with them.
