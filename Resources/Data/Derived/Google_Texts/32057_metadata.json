It was quite a turnaround from a shoddy performance against Kentucky.\n\nAllen scored a career-high 32 points, and the Blue Devils beat Georgetown, 86-84, on Sunday at Madison Square Garden.\n\nDerryck Thornton had 14 points and Matt Jones scored 11 points for the Blue Devils (4-1), who trailed by five at halftime.\n\nAllen bounced back after he scored six points on 2-for-11 shooting in Tuesday night\u2019s 74-63 loss to the second-ranked Wildcats.\n\nThe sophomore came off the bench and set a career high with 30 points in Friday night\u2019s win over VCU, then returned to the starting lineup against the Hoyas and went 9-for-12 in his fourth game with at least 25 points.\n\n\u201cI think more than prove a point, he wanted to show up,\u201d forward Amile Jefferson said. \u201cI think the performance he had this weekend was unbelievable. We\u2019re not in this game tonight without Grayson. He kept us afloat and he\u2019s been amazing.\u201d\n\nAllen went 5-for-6 from 3-point range and 9-for-9 at the free-throw line. He also had five rebounds, four assists and two steals.\n\n\u201cIt feels better to play better,\u201d Allen said. \u201cThat\u2019s the simple answer. For me, it was about making adjustments and I made those adjustments with the help of the coaches, film and feedback, and it definitely does feel better to play better.\u201d\n\nIsaac Copeland scored 21 points for Georgetown (1-3), but was scoreless in the second half until hitting two late 3-pointers. D\u2019Vauntes Smith-Rivera and freshman Kaleb Johnson each added 14 points.\n\nL.J. Peak\u2019s dunk with 17:10 left gave the Hoyas a 54-53 lead, but the Blue Devils responded with a 10-0 run. Allen got the surge started with three free throws, and Jefferson finished it off with a layup off a pass from Jones.\n\nGeorgetown made a few more charges, but the Blue Devils held on. Allen finished off a 7-0 run with a 3-pointer that made it 77-69 with 2:46 left.\n\nThe Hoyas closed to 86-84 on a 3-pointer by Copeland with seven seconds left. After Thornton missed two free throws with 5.4 seconds remaining, Copeland\u2019s 3-point attempt at the buzzer was short.\n\n\u201cI hit two shots before that so I was very confident,\u201d Copeland said. \u201cI got to a spot I wanted to get to, saw the clock running down and I shot it. It just fell a little short.\u201d\n\nDuke outrebounded Georgetown, 31-27, and went 28-for-36 at the line, compared to 19-for-24 for the Hoyas.\n\nBefore hitting two 3-pointers in the final two minutes of the first half, including the late heave from midcourt, Johnson had not attempted a 3-pointer in his brief college career.\n\nThe Hoyas shot 55 percent, 28-for-51, from the field.\n\nGeorgetown\u2019s only other meeting with Duke on a neutral site was at the Meadowlands in East Rutherford, New Jersey, in the NCAA tournament in 1989, which was Alonzo Mourning\u2019s freshman season.\n\nThe Blue Devils also won the 2K Classic in 2008, when they beat Michigan State by 15 points and Kyle Singler was named MVP.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Allen scored a career-high 32 points for Duke in his return to the starting lineup, helping the Blue Devils defeat Georgetown, 86-84, on Sunday in the 2K Classic title game at Madison Square Garden.", "Author": "Larry Fleisher", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Allen scored a career-high 32 points for Duke in his return to the starting lineup, helping the Blue Devils defeat Georgetown, 86-84, on Sunday in the 2K Classic title game at Madison Square Garden.", "title": "Grayson Allen leads Duke over Georgetown in 2K Classic championship", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/nov/22/grayson-allen-leads-duke-over-georgetown/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/11/22/AP_576211987754.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/11/22/AP_576211987754.jpg", "title": "Grayson Allen leads Duke over Georgetown in 2K Classic championship", "description": "Allen scored a career-high 32 points for Duke in his return to the starting lineup, helping the Blue Devils defeat Georgetown, 86-84, on Sunday in the 2K Classic title game at Madison Square Garden.", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "news_keywords": "Sports, Georgetown, Grayson Allen"}, "article_summary": "Allen scored a career-high 32 points, and the Blue Devils beat Georgetown, 86-84, on Sunday at Madison Square Garden.\nThe Blue Devils also won the 2K Classic in 2008, when they beat Michigan State by 15 points and Kyle Singler was named MVP.\n\u201cIt feels better to play better,\u201d Allen said.\nDerryck Thornton had 14 points and Matt Jones scored 11 points for the Blue Devils (4-1), who trailed by five at halftime.\nPeak\u2019s dunk with 17:10 left gave the Hoyas a 54-53 lead, but the Blue Devils responded with a 10-0 run."}
