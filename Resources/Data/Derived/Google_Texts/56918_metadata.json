So terrible was this injury and so far reaching its consequences, Dominique is seeking millions of dollars in damages from the city. Her case, however, has already been called into question because of the numerous photos she posts on social media which show her engaged in various activities of a vigorous nature, up to and including mountain climbing. Considering the claims being made on the part of the victim, that doesn\u2019t bode well for the case. But just to make sure the new evidence doesn\u2019t disappear down the memory hole, the city\u2019s lawyers have warned Ms. Sharpton not to start cleaning out her Instagram account.\n\nCity lawyers warned Dominique Sharpton not to delete Instagram photos like this one atop an Indonesian mountain \u2014 where she trekked while claiming in a lawsuit that she has \u201cpermanent\u201d \u00adinjuries. The city Law Department sent Rev. Al\u2019s daughter a letter telling her to preserve all of the damning evidence that she posted on her \u00adsocial-media accounts. The warning comes after The Post revealed that Dominique Sharpton has been globe-trotting despite her May 7 suit that says she will never fully recover from a sprained ankle she suffered on an uneven Soho street\u2026 \u201cThe purpose of this letter is to demand that plaintiff preserve any photographs, documents, communications and any other information, both tangible and electronically stored, potentially relevant to her alleged trip and fall on Dec. 23, 2014,\u201d de Blasio administration lawyer Michele Fox wrote in a May 20 letter filed in Manhattan Supreme Court.\n\nJust to be clear, there are some actually injured people who accomplish amazing things every single day. Charlie Linville left for Kathmandu, Nepal last month for his second attempt at climbing Mount Everest. It\u2019s an inspiring story which I think everyone should read and he can serve as an inspiration to all of us. Of course, the circumstances which led Charlie to face his challenges were slightly different than Al Sharpton\u2019s daughter since he had a leg and some other bits blown off while the Marine was serving in Afghanistan. But I\u2019m sure Dominique Sharpton can relate, having\u2026 tripped on a piece of paving stone on the sidewalk.\n\nI realize that a lot of crazy things happen in our courts when people seek damages, but at least one attorney has issued a warning that this may be a bridge too far even for liberal New York, and Dominique may not get the payday she is seeking.\n\nManhattan attorney David Jaroslawicz, who is not involved in the case, said Sharpton may see no more than $5,000 if her case goes to trial because she broke a cardinal rule for personal-injury plaintiffs: \u201cStay off Instagram!\u201d\n\nExit question: If the Sharptons came and offered to settle out of court for five grand, should the city give it to her just to make this go away?\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "Climb every mountain", "title": "Sharpton daughter warned not to delete pics of her \u201cseverely injured\u201d mountain climbing", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2015/05/23/sharpton-daughter-warned-not-to-delete-pics-of-her-severely-injured-mountain-climbing/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary", "creator": "@JazzShaw"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "article": {"published_time": "2015-05-23T23:01:11+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-05-23T20:32:39+00:00"}, "keywords": "Al Sharpton, fraud, lawsuit,", "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcdf8b\"", "article_summary": "But I\u2019m sure Dominique Sharpton can relate, having\u2026 tripped on a piece of paving stone on the sidewalk.\nCity lawyers warned Dominique Sharpton not to delete Instagram photos like this one atop an Indonesian mountain \u2014 where she trekked while claiming in a lawsuit that she has \u201cpermanent\u201d \u00adinjuries.\nAl\u2019s daughter a letter telling her to preserve all of the damning evidence that she posted on her \u00adsocial-media accounts.\nSharpton daughter warned not to delete pics of her \u201cseverely injured\u201d mountain climbingposted at 7:01 pm on May 23, 2015 by Jazz ShawNot too long ago we discussed the tragic story of Al Sharpton\u2019s daughter Dominique, who was suffering from grievous and likely lifelong pain and suffering after slipping and er\u2026 twisting her ankle on a public sidewalk.\nOf course, the circumstances which led Charlie to face his challenges were slightly different than Al Sharpton\u2019s daughter since he had a leg and some other bits blown off while the Marine was serving in Afghanistan."}
