There are administration and other types of fees built into premium costs, he notes. (See \u201cSelf-Funding Health Benefits Another Cost-Saving Strategy.\u201d)\n\nMichael S. Tesoriero, vice president and benefits consultant at The Segal Company in New York City, adds that Segal finds that health care trends for medical and hospital are still in the high single digits, and prescription cost trends are from 13% to 15%. In addition, the ACA is requiring fully ensured plans to pay more taxes and subsidies. According to a Sibson Consulting Perspectives article, co-written by Tesoriero, the ACA\u2019s new federal tax\u2014the Health Insurance Industry Fee\u2014has made it more attractive for organizations to self-insure or remain self-insured as the tax only applies to insured plans. The Health Insurance Industry Fee has increased rates for insured plans by approximately 2.5% to 3% (in addition to existing state premium taxes that can be as high as 2% to 3% of premium).\n\nHe adds that the ACA requires certain plan design features be included in fully insured plans which do not have to be included in self-insured plans. Berardo explains that self-insured plans still have to adhere to the minimum essential value and affordability requirements of the ACA, but sponsors of self-insured plans are free to not cover certain things, such as infertility treatments, if they don\u2019t want to.\n\nAccording to Berardo, traditional thinking has been that self-insuring health benefits was only an option for large plans, and he says, in some states, smaller employers are not allowed to self-insure. However, there are now products from providers such as CIGNA and AETNA that offer level funded self-insured plans to the small employer marketplace. The plans are self-insured, but allow employers to pay equal monthly fees up to their liability amount, and if the plan doesn\u2019t pay that amount in claims, employers get a refund.\n\nTesoriero adds that the thinking used to be that an employer needed to have a group of at least 300 to self-insure, because a small group may not be able to withstand claims fluctuation on monthly basis that a large group can. But, now that costs and requirements are increasing, funds with fewer than 300 lives are considering self-insuring. \u201cI understand some plans in the 50-lives range are considering self-insuring, and there are solutions out there,\u201d he tells PLANSPONSOR.\n\nA key consideration for employers thinking of moving to self-insured health benefits is monthly cash flow and how they can handle monthly cost variations\u2014claims may be higher in some months than others. \u201cDifferent employers have different risk tolerances and they have to consider what they will be comfortable doing,\u201d Tesoriero says.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Healthcare", "Description": "Increasing health care costs and provisions of the ACA are leading more employers to consider self-funding benefits or to reevaluate stop-loss insurance.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=2.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbbf7\"", "article_summary": "However, increasing health care costs and requirements of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) are leading more employers to consider self-funding their health benefits.\nHe adds that the ACA requires certain plan design features be included in fully insured plans which do not have to be included in self-insured plans.\nHowever, there are now products from providers such as CIGNA and AETNA that offer level funded self-insured plans to the small employer marketplace.\nBerardo explains that self-insured plans still have to adhere to the minimum essential value and affordability requirements of the ACA, but sponsors of self-insured plans are free to not cover certain things, such as infertility treatments, if they don\u2019t want to.\nA key consideration for employers thinking of moving to self-insured health benefits is monthly cash flow and how they can handle monthly cost variations\u2014claims may be higher in some months than others."}
