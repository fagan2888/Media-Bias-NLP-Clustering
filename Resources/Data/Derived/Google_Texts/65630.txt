We know that Republicans generally despise the Affordable Care Act (or maybe they just can’t stand the “Obama” part of Obamacare). We know that Democratic presidential contender Bernie Sanders long has favored a single-payer system.

But voters want more specifics, right? Right? (Sometimes it’s questionable.) Healthcare Executives Network has compiled video clips from some of the leading 2016 presidential candidates — as well as a few also-rans — and is taking an informal poll of readers through Nov. 13, asking which presidential hopeful has the “best” position on healthcare.

The videos come from presidential debates, stump speeches, voter forums, TV interviews and the campaigns themselves. Not every candidate is represented, but, let’s face it, the ones who are missing really don’t have much chance at winning their party’s nomination anyway.

The poll is sure to be unscientific, but it could be fun. The videos certainly are, particularly Donald Trump’s.

Here’s a sample from Republican Dr. Ben Carson.

And here’s what Democrat Hillary Clinton had to say.
