(Photo: Tom Tingle/The Republic) Story Highlights An accrediting agency says UA College of Medicine-Phoenix needs governance changes.\n\nThe Phoenix school must update accreditors by Dec. 1 in order to retain accreditation.\n\nUniversity of Arizona representatives say that fixes are in the works.\n\nAn accrediting body has warned the University of Arizona College of Medicine-Phoenix that without fixes to governing policies it could face more severe restrictions or lose its status as an independent medical school.\n\nThe Liaison Committee on Medical Education sent an 11-page letter to University of Arizona President Ann Weaver Hart this summer warning of potential adverse actions such as probation or a loss of accreditation for the university\u2019s downtown Phoenix medical school, which anchors the Phoenix Biomedical Campus.\n\nThe UA medical school in Phoenix secured the organization\u2019s \u201cpreliminary\u201d accreditation in July 2012, which allowed 80 students to begin their first-year classes at the newly accredited campus. The medical school opened in 2007 as a branch campus of the UA College of Medicine, which has had a Tucson medical school for a half-century.\n\nThe Phoenix campus was seeking \u201cprovisional\u201d accreditation, a mid-tier status before the Liaison Committee grants full accreditation. But the committee in June did not advance the Phoenix school\u2019s standing, instead putting the program on \u201cwarning\u201d status.\n\nThe Liaison Committee cited four standards that the Phoenix medical school failed to meet \u2014 or at least make enough progress on \u2014 and three standards that the organization will monitor to ensure compliance. The accrediting body also noted the Phoenix medical school\u2019s strengths, such as a simulation laboratory, learning spaces and support programs for students.\n\nThe medical school\u2019s dean must submit a progress report by Dec. 1 detailing fixes. The Phoenix medical school also must demonstrate progress toward compliance by June 2016 or the accrediting body \u201cmay impose probation or may take an adverse action, defined by the LCME as withdrawal of accreditation,\u201d the organization said in the letter.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Education recognizes the Liaison Committee as the accrediting body for medical education programs that offer an M.D. degree.\n\nCommunity leaders familiar with the issues urged the University of Arizona to address the accrediting organization\u2019s concerns.\n\n\u201cIt would seem to me this should be treated as an issue of the highest importance,\u201d said James H. Lundy, CEO of Alliance Bank of Arizona and past chairman of the Greater Phoenix Economic Council. \u201cIt\u2019s a situation that needs to be remedied and certainly should be remedied in the time frame set in the letter.\u201d\n\nOfficials at UA said they are working to address the accrediting organization\u2019s findings and have hired a consultant, PricewaterhouseCoopers, to make required improvements.\n\n\u201cThis is akin to an \u2018incomplete\u2019 on a grade in school,\u201d said Judy Bernas, UA\u2019s associate vice president of university relations. \u201cWe have some work to do, but we can get it done and progress to the next level.\u201d\n\nTwo of the four areas of non-compliance highlighted by the Liaison Committee involve issues that followed Banner Health\u2019s $1 billion-plus merger with the University of Arizona Health Network:\n\n\u2022The accrediting body\u2019s standards define a medical school dean\u2019s authority and responsibility. But the 30-year affiliation agreement between Banner Health and the university has the \u201cpotential to limit the traditional authority of the dean to ensure the availability of resources\u201d needed by the medical school, the Liaison Committee letter said.\n\n\u2022The Liaison Committee also questioned how the Banner-UA deal could impact the medical school\u2019s authority in forging training opportunities for students. The medical school\u2019s existing relationships with hospitals and other health providers can be terminated as of February 2019 under the Banner-UA agreement. Any new academic agreement with hospitals or other health-care providers would require the approval of a six-member academic-management council that consists of three appointees from both Banner and the university, but no appointees from the Phoenix medical school.\n\nA Banner Health spokesman said the Phoenix-based health-care system will work with the medical school as it moves toward full accreditation.\n\nEarlier this year, Phoenix-based Banner Health struck a deal to acquire the UA Health Network\u2019s two hospitals in Tucson and to partner with the UA College of Medicine. As part of that deal, Banner Health agreed to contribute $261 million to an academic-enhancement fund that would distribute $20 million each year to recruit faculty and develop programs at the UA\u2019s medical school campuses in Tucson and Phoenix.\n\nThe Liaison Committee also said that the medical school has had several vacant leadership positions since 2010. That absence of these department chairs, particularly in branches of medicine that are competitive for students seeking medical-training opportunities, may \u201cdisadvantage students seeking careers in these disciplines,\u201d the letter said.\n\nThe accrediting body also said that the Phoenix medical school\u2019s bylaws allow an admissions committee without a majority of faculty members to vet applications from prospective medical students. The Liaison Committee requires faculty members to make up the majority of voting members at such meetings.\n\nThe Phoenix medical school complies with three other areas that will be subject to ongoing monitoring. Those areas involve diversity among students, faculty and staff; financial aid and debt-management programs for students; and long-term and financial resources to support medical education.\n\nUA officials said that the university is working to address all aspects spelled out in the accrediting body\u2019s review of the medical school. For example, the university will soon launch a search to fill vacant leadership positions or appoint interim leaders. Of the 22 academic chair positions, 10 have vacancies, Bernas said.\n\nThe medical school drafted updates to its bylaws to meet the Liaison Committee standards. Faculty must approve those bylaw updates in a vote scheduled next month.\n\n\u201cThere is no mystery,\u201d Stuart Flynn, dean of the Phoenix medical school, said. \u201cWe know exactly what they expect.\u201d\n\nDan Hunt, co-secretary of the Liaison Committee, said he could not discuss his organization\u2019s report on the UA College of Medicine-Phoenix. But he said the most difficult step typically is obtaining preliminary accreditation, because that allows a school to accept students.\n\nHunt said his organization has denied several medical schools seeking approval for preliminary accreditation. However, all schools that have received preliminary accreditation have progressed to full accreditation.\n\n\u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean there couldn\u2019t be an exception to that in the future,\u201d Hunt said. \u201cAll schools have progressed, some a little faster, some a little slower.\u201d\n\nThe Arizona Board of Regents also anticipates that UA officials will provide an update on the Phoenix medical school\u2019s efforts next month, Regent Rick Myers said.\n\n\u201cThe regents and the university are absolutely committed to its success,\u201d Myers said of the Phoenix medical school. \u201cIf there is something we need to do, we will do what it takes to make sure it is successful.\u201d\n\nON THE BEAT\n\nKen Alltucker covers health care as a member of The Arizona Republic\u2019s watchdog team.
