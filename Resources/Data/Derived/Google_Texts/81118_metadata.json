The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) announced the Universal Giving program, which has expanded the number and types of charities to which federal employees can direct their donations.\n\nPreviously, federal employee gifts through CFC were limited to either national charities or charities in the employees\u2019 own regions. Now, they can give to any listed charity. So, for instance, according to this article, a federal worker in the Washington area could see the number of groups to which he or she could give increase sixfold this year, from 4,000 to 24,000.\n\nOPM Director Katherine Archuleta noted, \u201cThis is important as the American workforce becomes more mobile\u2014[federal employees can donate to] the charities closest to [their] hearts regardless of the region they currently work in.\u201d\n\nDonations through the CFC have declined every year since 2009, dipping a big 19 percent between 2012 and 2013. Is this a significant change that will cause donations to increase?\n\nGovernment Executive reports that it did a poll in 2012 that indicated that many federal workers are not soured on giving but are less enthusiastic about using the CFC as an intermediary.\n\nAs NPQ reported, in April the CFC\u2019s regulations were overhauled to much skepticism from both sides of the aisle.\u2014Ruth McCambridge", "article_metadata": {"description": "The new CFC campaign has relaxed restrictions on where donations can be directed.
