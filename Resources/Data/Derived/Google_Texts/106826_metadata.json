This is in part because of a surge in M&A activity, and also because of the increase in hospital admissions following the Affordable Care Act, which seems to be offsetting some of the losses felt following an extra tax imposed as part of the ACA.\n\nNonetheless, there is still plenty of life in the sector. Despite yesterday's falls, biotech stocks are still outstripping the performance of the rest of the Nasdaq year-to-date. And, of course, Clinton may not win next year \u2013 she hasn't even secured the Democratic Party's nomination yet.", "article_metadata": {"AssetType": "cnbcnewsstory", "description": "Hillary Clinton\u2019s promise of a clampdown on biotech drug pricing Monday is already causing consternation in the sector.", "author": "Catherine Boyle", "og": {"site_name": "CNBC", "description": "Hillary Clinton\u2019s promise of a clampdown on biotech drug pricing Monday is already causing consternation in the sector.", "title": "Could Clinton be worse for biotech than Obamacare?", "url": "http://www.cnbc.com/2015/09/22/could-clinton-be-worse-for-biotechs-than-obamacare.html", "image": "http://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2015/09/21/103013242-GettyImages-488773802.1910x1000.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Hillary Clinton\u2019s promise of a clampdown on biotech drug pricing Monday is already causing consternation in the sector.", "title": "Could Clinton be worse for biotechs than Obamacare?", "url": "http://www.cnbc.com/2015/09/22/could-clinton-be-worse-for-biotechs-than-obamacare.html", "image": {"src": "http://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2015/09/21/103013242-GettyImages-488773802.1910x1000.jpg"}, "creator": "@cboylecnbc", "site": "@CNBC", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "al": {"ios": {"app_name": "CNBC Business News and Finance", "app_store_id": 398018310}}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=398018310", "GOOGLEBOT": "unavailable_after: 31 Dec 9999 23:59:59 GMT", "keywords": "Health Care, Health Care, Pharmaceuticals, Medicine, US: News, Politics, United States, iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF, business news", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/cnbc", "published_time": "2015-09-22T09:20:35-0400", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/CNBC", "section": "Health Care", "modified_time": "2015-09-22T11:46:28-0400", "tag": "iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF"}, "pageNodeId": 103016308, "news_keywords": "Hillary Clinton, biotechs, president, market outlook, business, Wall Street,"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0c92\"", "article_summary": "Deals worth nearly $300 billion have already been announced this year, up nearly 50 percent from the same time in 2014, according Dealogic data.\nAnd, of course, Clinton may not win next year \u2013 she hasn't even secured the Democratic Party's nomination yet.\nMedical device companies have also seen increased interest, with both UBS and Moody's issuing positive notes on the sector recently.\nDespite yesterday's falls, biotech stocks are still outstripping the performance of the rest of the Nasdaq year-to-date.\nNonetheless, there is still plenty of life in the sector."}
