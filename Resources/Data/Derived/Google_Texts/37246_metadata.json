As a result, the authors posit that hallucinations don\u2019t always have to be associated with mental illness.\n\n\u201cWe used to think that only people with psychosis heard voices or had delusions, but now we know that otherwise healthy, high-functioning people also report these experiences,\u201d Professor John McGrath, an author of the study, said in the press release. \u201cOf those who have these experiences, a third only have them once and another third only have two-to-five episodes across their life. These people seem to function reasonably well. So it\u2019s incredibly interesting that not only is hearing voices more common than previously thought, but it\u2019s not always linked to serious mental illness.\u201d\n\nIn the study, researchers examined 31,000 people from 19 different countries, questioning them about their overall mental health. They found that sound hallucinations were more likely to occur in women than in men, as well as people who were from richer countries. Ultimately, they hope this information will help them learn more about the causes of severe hallucinatory disorders \u2014 as well as ways to mitigate the effects.\n\n\u201cIn particular, we are interested in learning why some people recover, while others may progress to more serious disorders such as schizophrenia,\u201d McGrath said in the press release. \u201cWe need to understand why it\u2019s temporary for some people and permanent for others. We can use these findings to start identifying whether the mechanisms causing these hallucinations are the same or different in both situations. We need to rethink the link between hearing voices and mental health \u2014 it\u2019s more subtle than previously thought.\u201d\n\nSource: McGrath J et al.
