A Times/CBS News poll in December found that, relative to two years earlier, roughly three times as many African-Americans said their family\u2019s financial situation was better as said it was worse, while Democrats without a college degree were almost evenly split on this question.\n\nGeoff Garin, a strategist for Mrs. Clinton\u2019s 2008 campaign who currently polls for Priorities USA Action, a pro-Clinton \u201csuper PAC,\u201d posited that for a more economically marginal group like African-Americans, the unemployment rate \u2014 which has declined significantly for all racial groups in recent years \u2014 carries more importance than growth in incomes and certain assets, which have been slower to recover. For whites, even working-class whites, whose jobless rate is substantially lower than that for African-Americans, the latter took on comparatively more importance.\n\n\u201cThe major source of economic anxiety for working-class white men is not whether they have a job tomorrow,\u201d Mr. Garin said, \u201cit\u2019s that they still haven\u2019t had their personal recovery. Their recovery is about assets and income.\u201d For African-Americans, on the other hand, \u201cyou don\u2019t take job growth for granted.\u201d\n\nHe cited polling data showing that working-class white Democrats were roughly as concerned about inequality as they were about job growth and economic growth, while African-Americans were overwhelmingly concerned about the latter two. It is no surprise, Mr. Garin said, that Mrs. Clinton, who has had a similar emphasis in her campaign, did better among African-Americans, while Mr. Sanders\u2019s emphasis on inequality resonated more with whites.\n\nIn a similar vein, there is anecdotal evidence suggesting that African-Americans and Hispanic voters are more likely to use the economy\u2019s recent low point, in 2008 and 2009, as the base line for their judgment than are whites, who may focus on more recent performance, where improvement has been less pronounced.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nDavid Simas, the White House political director, recalled sitting in on focus groups when he worked for the 2012 Obama campaign for ads that began by reminding voters how bleak the economy had been when Barack Obama first took office. \u201cThe folks who responded to it the most were African-Americans and Hispanic voters,\u201d he said.\n\nWillie Minor, an African-American actor in Dallas, who runs a small theater company, recalled that in 2009, \u201cI called all my lenders and creditors, asked for extensions, made partial payments, things like that.\u201d He said that since then, thanks in part to increased revenue from the company\u2019s productions, he has \u201cbeen more secure financially.\u201d\n\nThe Affordable Care Act may be another aspect of President Obama\u2019s economic record that minority voters and working-class whites view differently. \u201cBlacks and Hispanics benefited more from the A.C.A.,\u201d said Simon Rosenberg, president of NDN, a policy and advocacy group. \u201cIt was a really dramatic lowering of their uninsured rate, which was obviously material to their economic health and their overall comfort in the world.\u201d\n\nMr. Minor said that while he received his health care through the Department of Veterans Affairs, many of his friends \u201chad no insurance and no possibility of getting insurance.\u201d\n\n\u201cObamacare has been a boon to them,\u201d he said.\n\nBy contrast, many whites, who were insured at a higher rate than the other groups before the Affordable Care Act took effect, saw the program as detrimental to their interests. \u201cThe promise of Obamacare was to make it more affordable for everybody,\u201d said J. J. Price, a firefighter and union member in Roanoke, Va., who voted for Mr. Obama in 2008 but Mitt Romney in 2012. \u201cIt\u2019s done nothing but make it more expensive on us, the working class.\u201d\n\nMrs. Clinton, of course, has been a dogged defender of the Affordable Care Act, while Mr. Sanders has dwelled on the program\u2019s not going far enough. He prefers a single-payer system akin to expanding Medicare for the entire population.\n\nThe dynamic on the Affordable Care Act suggests a broader difference when it comes to African-Americans and working-class whites: When Mr. Sanders implicitly criticizes Mr. Obama from the left, white working-class Democrats may see it as advocating for their economic interests, but the claims tend to fall flat with many blacks, among whom the president is still wildly popular.\n\nLarry Cohen, a senior adviser to Mr. Sanders and past president of the Communications Workers of America, said that Mrs. Clinton\u2019s perceived loyalty to the administration, as well as the nearly uniform support for Mrs. Clinton within the black political establishment, especially in the South, were key factors in limiting Mr. Sanders\u2019s support among African-Americans.\n\nOthers largely agree. \u201cI don\u2019t think you can discount how important President Obama is,\u201d said Stanley B. Greenberg, a former Clinton White House pollster who recently conducted focus groups with African-American voters in Philadelphia and Cleveland. \u201cObama and his election and re-election is seen as on a scale of what the civil rights movement achieved.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHe added that Mrs. Clinton, by way of her service in the administration and her eagerness to defend the president\u2019s policies on the campaign trail, \u201cis seen as having a more instinctive identification with Obama.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime":
