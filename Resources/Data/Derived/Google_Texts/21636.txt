Firefighters extinguished a blaze at a restaurant in Old Town Fort Collins on Sunday morning before flames could destroy the business and surrounding structures.

The fire started about 9:30 a.m. on the 200 block of Linden Street at the Suehiro restaurant, the Poudre Fire Authority said.

Crews found “heavy smoke when investigating for a kitchen fire this morning at a two-story commercial building,” officials said. Firefighters found the fire was burning in the walls between floors of the building.

About 32 firefighters battled the two-alarm fire, which took four-plus hours to put out.

The cause of the fire, which did not cause injuries, is under investigation, the authority said.
