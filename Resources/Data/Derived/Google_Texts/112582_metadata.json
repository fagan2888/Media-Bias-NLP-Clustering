Mike Pence signed the controversial religious freedom bill, members of the South Bend business community spoke out to say they are open for business \u2014 to anyone.\n\nOrganized by South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg, those who chose to stand against the new law gathered Friday afternoon at Le Peep restaurant in downtown. The goal was to promote that, no matter what the state does, South Bend is a community that doesn\u2019t discriminate.\n\n\u201cFor the last 24 hours Indiana has been getting the wrong kind of attention,\u201d Buttigieg said at Friday\u2019s gathering. \u201cWe are here to say that\u2019s not us, that\u2019s not South Bend.\u201d\n\nPence signed SB 101 Thursday morning, which extends protections to businesses to deny service to someone based on religious beliefs. While supporters of the bill say it\u2019s needed to protect people\u2019s right to follow their religious beliefs, opponents are worried it\u2019s opening the state to protected discrimination and sending the wrong message to the rest of the country.\n\n\u201cOur greatest challenge is to continue to attract and retain the most talented, the most diverse workforce we can, and this misguided legislation sends exactly the wrong message,\u201d Greg Downes, of Gibson Insurance Group, said.\n\nAnd before Pence had even signed the bill, organizations from across the country were threatening to pull business from the state. The gamer convention Gen Con, one of the biggest conventions Indianapolis hosts, said in a statement that discussions on whether to remain in Indy or move elsewhere have begun. Gen Con\u2019s contract with the city runs through 2020.\n\nThe NCAA also chimed in saying the bill could damage Indianapolis\u2019 reputation as a host of major sporting events. This year\u2019s NCAA men\u2019s basketball tournament finals are being held in Indy.\n\nBut even with pressure from organizations across the county, Pence defended signing the bill, referencing recent litigation stemming from the Affordable Care Act in which the University of Notre Dame filed lawsuits challenging provisions that require the institution to provide coverage that went against its religious views.\n\nAnd Pence said in a statement, \u201cThis bill is not about discrimination, and if I thought it legalized discrimination in any way in Indiana, I would have vetoed it. ... In fact, it does not even apply to disputes between private parties unless government action is involved.\u201d\n\nEven though Pence\u2019s statement isn\u2019t giving South Bend business owners comfort, many say the new law won\u2019t change anything. Joe Hart, president of the South Bend Cubs, said Friday that his organization has been working for the past few years to create a venue that is fan-friendly and that\u2019s how things will continue.\n\n\u201cPlease know the South Bend Cubs are very welcoming,\u201d Hart said. \u201cI hope we have proven that in the past years and that is certainly going to continue.\u201d\n\nAnd soon any area business that wants to show it is open to any customer can get a sticker from the city to display that says just that. The stickers are not ready yet, and the exact phrasing hasn\u2019t been decided, but Buttigieg said they will soon be available through the business licensing department.\n\n\u201cWe have worked too hard to build our economy and move our community into the 21st century to be dragged back in time by Indianapolis politicians more interested in a devisive social agenda than in the pressing issues of today,\u201d Buttigieg said.\n\nlwright@SBTinfo.com\n\n574-235-6324\n\n@LWrightSBT", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "South Bend Tribune", "description": "Companies and Mayor Pete\u00a0Buttigieg say Indiana's new religious freedom law shouldn't reflect poorly on South Bend", "title": "South Bend businesses: We don't discriminate", "url": "http://www.southbendtribune.com/news/local/south-bend-businesses-we-don-t-discriminate/article_c12e30fa-2295-5fec-a798-ed75c7d249a0.html", "image": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/southbendtribune.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/a/8c/a8c4fa70-dde7-545a-849a-7523c9c59ba6/551642852da49.image.jpg?resize=760%2C571", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/southbendtribune.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/a/8c/a8c4fa70-dde7-545a-849a-7523c9c59ba6/551642852da49.image.jpg?resize=760%2C571", "description": "Companies and Mayor Pete\u00a0Buttigieg say Indiana's new religious freedom law shouldn't reflect poorly on South Bend", "site": "@sbtribune", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "South Bend businesses: We don't discriminate"}, "description": "Companies and Mayor Pete\u00a0Buttigieg say Indiana's new religious freedom law shouldn't reflect poorly on South Bend", "Published Date": "2015-03-28T05:00:00", "fb": {"app_id": 368553839952510}, "keywords": "#loc,local,politics,religiousfreedom,featured", "google-site-verification": "3g1dW83HuQbWT4MB-AtH0czzqvwh0eF8rwGwC6sjOhM", "news_keywords": "#loc,local,politics,religiousfreedom,featured"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2cce\"", "article_summary": "The goal was to promote that, no matter what the state does, South Bend is a community that doesn\u2019t discriminate.\nSOUTH BEND \u2014 Just a day after Indiana Gov.\nOrganized by South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg, those who chose to stand against the new law gathered Friday afternoon at Le Peep restaurant in downtown.\n\u201cPlease know the South Bend Cubs are very welcoming,\u201d Hart said.\nMike Pence signed the controversial religious freedom bill, members of the South Bend business community spoke out to say they are open for business \u2014 to anyone."}
