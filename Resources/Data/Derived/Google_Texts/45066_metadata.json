As a result of this power differential, the Christian Right, while energized and mobilized, would be forced to sit when told to sit by the party\u2019s big wigs. But those days are history.\n\nToday, the Christian Right is armed with networks and pipelines of unprecedented levels of campaign financing. Its consortium of donor channels includes the Club for Growth, Senate Conservatives Fund, FreedomWorks, and a cadre of hyper-religious organizations such as the Christian Coalition, Christian Broadcasting Network, American Values, and the Family Research Council.\n\nThe Christian Right can now raise enough cash to compete and win in Republican primaries against Chamber of Commerce-sponsored establishment candidates. According to the Federal Electoral Commission, Tea Party and social conservative groups raised nearly three times as much as GOP establishment groups in 2013.\n\nThe Christian Right is not only an existential threat to the future of the Republican Party, it\u2019s also an existential threat to our secular democracy, for it wishes to transform America into a tyrannical theocracy governed by biblical law. With the warring Republican factions preparing to square off in a series of Senate and House primaries, here are the Christian Right\u2019s most favored candidates for the 2014 election cycle.\n\n1. Matt Bevin: Republican Candidate for U.S. Senate in Kentucky\n\nMatt Bevin, a self-employed businessman, is contesting the GOP primary for Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell\u2019s seat. Bevin, who describes his life as being \u201cbuilt on a bedrock of strong Christian values,\u201d is now leading McConnell by 4 according to the most recent Rasmussen Report poll.\n\nRight-wing blogger and Fox News contributor Erick Erickson says Democrats are \u201csquealing like a stuffed pig\u201d because of polling data that shows Bevin leading Democrat Allison Grimes, while McConnell only draws out a statistical tie. \u201cIf the GOP does not gain the Senate in 2014, it will probably be because they lose Kentucky. They only lose Kentucky if Mitch McConnell is the Republican nominee,\u201d says Erickson.\n\nLike all those on the far right, Bevin, who is a Southern Baptist, is obsessed with controlling all matters related to sex and abortion. Earlier this month, on the 41st anniversary of Roe v. Wade, Bevin penned an op-ed that read, \u201cThe fight for the unborn could not be any more important. Since that dark day in 1973, America has seen more than 55 million babies killed under the guise of \u2018choice\u2026.Being pro-life is more than simply a slogan to us. It is a belief that every life, born and unborn, is so precious to our Creator, that it compels us to action.\u201d\n\nIn case you missed it the first time, he\u2019s leading McConnell and the Democrats by a handy margin.\n\n2. Pam Barlow: Republican Candidate for U.S. Congress in Texas Congressional District 10\n\nPam Barlow is a Tea Party-endorsed candidate contesting a U.S. congressional seat held by establishment incumbent Mac Thornberry.\n\nBarlow is a veterinarian, retired US Army Lieutenant Colonel and small business owner in Bowie, TX. She describes herself as an \u201cunashamed Republican Tea Party Christian Conservative with a loud voice and some rock-solid core values.\u201d You know, values such as opposing women\u2019s reproductive rights, marriage equality, raising the minimum wage and immigration reform.\n\nWhen it comes to tackling the nation\u2019s most complex fiscal issues as they relate to taxes, spending and federal budgets, she\u2019s got that covered, because in her words, \u201cAs a small business owner, I know how to save money\u2014 in fact, I can pinch a penny until Abe has a migraine.\u201d\n\nBarlow believes her qualifications as a veterinarian place her in good stead when it comes to dealing with WMDs. \u201cMany folks are unaware that what we call \u2018weapons of mass destruction\u2019 are, in fact, modified zoonotic animal diseases and pesticides. Veterinarians understand the diagnosis and treatment of these things, and the means available to protect the public,\u201d she wrote on her blog site.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Think the current crop of Congressional Republicans is bad?
