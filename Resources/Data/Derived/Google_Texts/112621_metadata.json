He noted how this president seems justified in \u201cstaying aloof\u201d regarding this crisis, even as the security situation continues to deteriorate to the point where scores of Syrians are flooding Europe. To make matters worse, Hiatt cited that Obama has political cover for this inaction, given that he has two humanitarian interventionist hawks in his cabinet: Susan Rice and Samantha Power. Power is known for her book A Problem From Hell, which detailed American hesitance to confront genocide in the post-World War II era:\n\nHe has argued that we would only make things worse \u2014 \u201cI am more mindful probably than most,\u201d he told the New Republic in 2013, \u201cof not only our incredible strengths and capabilities, but also our limitations.\u201d He has implied that because we can\u2019t solve every problem, maybe we shouldn\u2019t solve any. \u201cHow do I weigh tens of thousands who\u2019ve been killed in Syria versus the tens of thousands who are currently being killed in the Congo?\u201d he asked (though at the time thousands were not being killed in Congo). [\u2026] Perversely, the worse Syria became, the more justified the president seemed for staying aloof; steps that might have helped in 2012 seemed ineffectual by 2013, and actions that could have saved lives in 2013 would not have been up to the challenge presented by 2014. The fact that the woman who wrote the book on genocide, Samantha Power, and the woman who campaigned to bomb Sudan to save the people of Darfur, Susan Rice, could apparently in good conscience stay on as U.N. ambassador and national security adviser, respectively, lent further moral credibility to U.S. abdication. [\u2026] \u2026There also has been something to be admired in America\u2019s determination to help \u2014 to ask, even if we cannot save everyone in Congo, can we not save some people in Syria? Obama\u2019s successful turning of that question on its head is nothing to be proud of.\n\nHiatt adds that while foreign policy realists are right to say that national interests must be taken into account\u2013and that we cannot save everyone, nor intervene everywhere. But there has to be some justification for doing nothing concerning Syria, a scintilla of good news from our inaction. We have seen none.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe airstrikes could have been more aggressive. In either case, the situation wasn\u2019t good. Airstrikes did little to curb violence on the ground, and some of the Syrian rebels pledged their allegiance to al-Qaeda. That\u2019s not exactly something that incentivizes Washington to put the pedal to the metal concerning aid, training, and military equipment.\n\nSo, yes, Obama is the president. The buck stops with him, though he could have mitigated some of the embarrassment if he was serious about setting \u201cred lines\u201d in Syria. If we weren\u2019t prepared to do what was necessary when President Bashar al-Assad launched a Sarin gas attack in 2013, then, obviously, no remarks about red lines should have been made. Like Hillary\u2019s email server, the Syrian puzzle isn\u2019t going away.", "article_metadata": {"description": "aloof.05/26/2016 2:20:56AM EST.", "author": "Matt Vespa", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "aloof", "title": "Matt Vespa - WaPo Editor: Obama Has \u2018Nothing To Be Proud Of\u2019 With Syrian Foul-Up", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/mattvespa/2015/09/09/wapo-editor-obama-has-nothing-to-be-proud-of-with-syrian-foulup-n2050120", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015/252/ed0ce326-a0be-4c7e-bd3c-93ceb140a4cf.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "aloof", "title": "Matt Vespa - WaPo Editor: Obama Has \u2018Nothing To Be Proud Of\u2019 With Syrian Foul-Up", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/mattvespa/2015/09/09/wapo-editor-obama-has-nothing-to-be-proud-of-with-syrian-foulup-n2050120", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015/252/ed0ce326-a0be-4c7e-bd3c-93ceb140a4cf.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "WaPo Editor: Obama Has \u2018Nothing To Be Proud Of\u2019 With Syrian Foul-Up, Matt Vespa, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe14ce\"", "article_summary": "Airstrikes did little to curb violence on the ground, and some of the Syrian rebels pledged their allegiance to al-Qaeda.\nThe Washington Post\u2019s editorial page editor, Fred Hiatt, is appalled by the United States\u2019 lack of action concerning the Syrian Civil War and the rise of the Islamic State.\nBut there has to be some justification for doing nothing concerning Syria, a scintilla of good news from our inaction.\nObama\u2019s successful turning of that question on its head is nothing to be proud of.\nTo make matters worse, Hiatt cited that Obama has political cover for this inaction, given that he has two humanitarian interventionist hawks in his cabinet: Susan Rice and Samantha Power."}
