Jay Leno took another shot at the President Tuesday night.

Early in his opening monologue, the NBC Tonight Show host commented about Kanye West wanting to be the Obama of clothing saying, “To achieve his goal, he's designing fashion nobody wants and offering it on a website that doesn't work” (video follows with transcript and absolutely no need for additional commentary):

JAY LENO: Well, I love this. In a radio interview, Kanye West said he wants to be the Obama of clothing. [Laughter] That's what he said. He wants to be the Obama of clothing. And to achieve his goal, he's designing fashion nobody wants and offering it on a website that doesn't work. So it should be fascinating. Should be fascinating.
