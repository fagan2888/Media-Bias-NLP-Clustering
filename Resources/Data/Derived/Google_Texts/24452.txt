A man suffered burns to a hand in an accidental fire Saturday afternoon in the detached garage of his home at 2201 S.E. 53rd, an official said.

The injured man, Fred Wiens, was treated at the scene by American Medical Response ambulance workers but declined to be taken to a hospital by ambulance.

The blaze caused what appeared to be damages totaling $25,000 to $30,000 to the building and its contents, said Lt. Darin Daniels of the Shawnee Heights Fire Department.

The fire began when gasoline leaking from a vehicle inside the garage came into contact with an ignition source, Daniels said.

He said firefighters were called at 2:04 p.m to the scene, where they had the blaze out by 2:21 p.m.

The fire scene was less than a half-mile east of the Shawnee Heights Fire Department station at 5305 S.E. California Ave.
