I couldn\u2019t imagine a better place to nerd out for science.\u201d\n\nThe two-week expedition takes place aboard a vessel where 66 students and 23 expert staff learn, live and leave to explore their Antarctic surroundings.\n\nHighlights of the trip include whale watching, glacier climbing, ice coring and touring research facilities, said Geoff Green, Students on Ice founder and expedition leader.\n\n\u201cAntarctica is such a powerful place,\u201d Green said. \u201cIt humbles people and helps put things in perspective in many ways. It\u2019s like going to a different planet and looking back at Earth.\u201d\n\nSayer said her eyes have been opened during the journey. Aside from seeing her first whale, learning firsthand from esteemed researchers and exploring glaciers, she said her future plans have changed, too.\n\n\u201cI was unsure whether or not I would want to do research after college or medical school, but after seeing all this, I\u2019m strongly considering going into polar research because I can see myself here,\u201d Sayer said.\n\nElizabeth Hernandez: 303-954-1223, ehernandez@denverpost.com or twitter.com/ehernandez", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Colorado Mesa University student embarks on Antarctic expedition", "title": "Colorado Mesa University student embarks on Antarctic expedition", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/01/04/colorado-mesa-university-student-embarks-on-antarctic-expedition/", "image": {"width": 529, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150104__OliviaSayerp1.jpg", "height": 654}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150104__OliviaSayerp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-01-04T15:56:20+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T05:15:08+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe31b5\"", "article_summary": "When she learned the program was accepting university students, Sayer eagerly applied and was accepted.\nA self-proclaimed \u201cscience nerd\u201d and third year Colorado Mesa University student spent her winter break differently than most \u2014 having the Antarctic expedition of a lifetime.\nHighlights of the trip include whale watching, glacier climbing, ice coring and touring research facilities, said Geoff Green, Students on Ice founder and expedition leader.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a lifelong dream of mine to see the research stations in Antarctica, and we\u2019ve gotten to see two.\nAside from seeing her first whale, learning firsthand from esteemed researchers and exploring glaciers, she said her future plans have changed, too."}
