Andrew P. Scott, USA TODAY\n\nPresident Obama\u2019s final State of the Union Address came up short of the facts on several topics:\n\n\u2022 He embellished his record on jobs, citing \u201cmore than 14 million new jobs,\u201d without mentioning that\u2019s only private sector jobs and only since the job losses hit bottom in February 2010.\n\n\u2022 Obama similarly omitted part of his presidency in boasting of nearly 900,000 manufacturing jobs \u201cin the past six years.\u201d Over his entire time in office, manufacturing jobs have gone down by 230,000.\n\n\u2022 And he said he had cut the country\u2019s deficits by \u201calmost three-quarters.\u201d But that\u2019s measured from fiscal 2009, which included some increased spending by Obama.\n\n\u2022 He repeated his now years-long claim of crediting the Affordable Care Act for a slowdown in health care spending, which economists have linked mainly to the economy. In fact, the growth rate jumped in 2014, when the law\u2019s coverage provisions were implemented.\n\n\u2022 Obama claimed, like he did in 2014, that the U.S. has \u201ccut carbon pollution more than any other country on Earth.\u201d That\u2019s true in terms of total tonnage but not in terms of percentage reductions.\n\n\u2022 He said that the U.S. spends \u201cmore on our military than the next eight nations combined.\u201d That\u2019s close enough in terms of dollars, but as a share of the nation\u2019s economy, the U.S. is only the fourth highest of the top 15 countries.\n\nRead the full text of Obama's speech\n\nObama opened his Jan. 12 State of the Union Address with a promise: \u201cTonight marks the eighth year that I\u2019ve come here to report on the state of the union. And for this final one, I\u2019m going to try to make it a little shorter.\u201d And he sort of succeeded \u2014 if we only count the seven, not eight, official SOTU addresses. According to data from The American Presidency Project at the University of California, Santa Barbara, the latest speech clocked in at 58 minutes and 44 seconds, more than a minute shorter than 2013\u2019s 59-minute-51-second address. (And several minutes below Obama\u2019s average of one hour, two minutes and 45 seconds.)\n\nBut Obama\u2019s 2009 speech, which the project notes was technically not a State of the Union, was only 51 minutes and 44 seconds.\n\nNow we\u2019ll look at what the president actually said in his 58-plus minutes.\n\nJobs & the Deficit\n\nAs he has done in the past, Obama embellished the statistical record of his presidency by selective omissions.\n\nJobs \u2014 He crowed about \u201cmore than 14 million new jobs,\u201d when the net gain in total employment since he first took office is actually just under 9.3 million. What he didn\u2019t spell out is that he was omitting the more than 4 million jobs lost during the first 13 months of his presidency, and ignoring losses of state and local government jobs as well.\n\nThough he did not make it clear, he was actually referring to the change only in private sector jobs, and only since the job losses hit bottom in February 2010. And as of December that gain indeed stood at 14.1 million.\n\nUnemployment rate \u2014 The president also referred to \u201can unemployment rate cut in half.\u201d Actually, the jobless rate when he took office was 7.8%, and it has dropped to 5% as of December. It\u2019s only \u201ccut in half\u201d if measured from the worst point of his presidency, which was the 10% rate recorded in October 2009.\n\nManufacturing \u2014 Obama also cherry-picked when he spoke of manufacturing jobs. The president said, \u201cThat\u2019s just part of a manufacturing surge that\u2019s created nearly 900,000 new jobs in the past six years.\u201d The gain was 878,000 to be exact, measured from the low point in his presidency.\n\nBut of course, he has been president for seven years, not just six. And over his entire time in office, the U.S. has lost 230,000 manufacturing jobs, dropping from 12,561,000 jobs in January 2009 to 12,331,000 in December 2015, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nDeficit \u2014 He also boasted that \u201cwe\u2019ve done all this while cutting our deficits by almost three-quarters.\u201d That\u2019s close to true if measured from the $1.4 trillion deficit run up in fiscal 2009. The final figure for FY 2015 \u2014 which ended Sept. 30 \u2014 was $438.9 billion.\n\nSo that\u2019s still 31% of the 2009 figure, which is closer to a two-thirds reduction than a three-quarters reduction.\n\nMore important, it ignores Obama\u2019s own contribution to that record 2009 deficit. As we\u2019ve shown before, Obama\u2019s early initiatives increased FY 2009 spending \u2014 and thus the deficit \u2014 by as much as $203 billion. So his claim to have reduced the deficit by three-quarters is akin to a merchant who raises his price one day and declares \u201c75% off\u201d the next.\n\nHealth Care Inflation\n\nObama again credited the Affordable Care Act for slow growth in health care inflation that economists have pinned largely on the economy, and that started before the ACA was even passed.\n\n\u201cNearly 18 million people have gained coverage so far,\u201d Obama said of his health care overhaul. \u201cAnd in the process, health care inflation has slowed.\u201d\n\nAs we have written severaltimesnow, health care spending has grown at historically low rates in recent years. From 2009 to 2012, total national health care expenditures rose at rates around 4% per year, and dipped as low as 2.9% in 2013. For 2014, the latest figure available, health care spending growth jumped up to 5.3% (see Table 1 of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services\u2019 health care expenditures data).\n\nThe journal Health Affairs noted in 2012 that the growth rates were the lowest since CMS started compiling the National Health Expenditure Accounts data in 1960.\n\nBut what impact would the ACA have had on spending growth rates? Note that the slowdown began in 2009, a year before the health care law was enacted. And the latest figure for 2014 \u2014 a year in which the major coverage provisions of the law went into effect, including the establishment of the health care exchanges and expansion of Medicaid \u2014 actually went up.\n\nIn fact, experts have said the lower rates of growth have been largely a reflection of the sluggish economy. A 2013 analysis by the Kaiser Family Foundation said that \u201cmuch of the decline in health spending growth in recent years was fully expected given what was happening more broadly in the economy.\u201d CMS\u2019 experts said in 2014 that the ACA had had a \u201cminimal impact.\u201d\n\nThe health care law could have had some effect on the slower growth: Drew Altman, CEO of KFF, wrote in 2013 that the law could be having an indirect effect, and the White House Council of Economic Advisers\u2019 November 2013 report said that the ACA\u2019s reductions in Medicare spending would have a \u201cspillover effect\u201d on spending overall.\n\nObama ties an increase in the number of insured to a slowdown in health spending, but back in 2014 CMS\u2019 experts projected the opposite: a bump up in the growth rate in the future, due to expanded insurance coverage under the ACA. CMS estimated an average growth of 6% per year for 2015 through 2023, \u201clargely as a result of the continued implementation of the ACA coverage expansions, faster projected economic growth, and the aging of the population.\u201d\n\nAnd 2014\u2019s growth rate of 5.3% moves health care spending toward that very projection.\n\nAs for Obama\u2019s claim that \u201cnearly 18 million have gained coverage so far,\u201d that\u2019s an administration estimate based largely on the Gallup-Healthways Well-Being Index Survey through September 2015. The administration says 15.3 million gained insurance coverage through the individual marketplace, including the state and federal exchanges, and Medicaid, and another 2.3 million young adults have gained coverage due to the ACA\u2019s September 2010 provision requiring insurers to keep them on their parents\u2019 plans until age 26.\n\nThese are estimates, and the more robust and official numbers from the CDC\u2019s National Health Interview Survey only go through June 2015. But they show a drop in the uninsured of 17.8 million from 2009, a year before the ACA was enacted (46.3 million), to the first six months of 2015 (28.5 million).\n\nCutting Carbon Emissions\n\nAs he did in his 2014 address, Obama claimed that the U.S. has \u201ccut carbon pollution more than any other country on Earth.\u201d That\u2019s true, at least in terms of the total tonnage of emissions reduced. However, other countries have reduced their emissions by a larger percentage than the U.S.\n\nWe most recently checked this claim in December when Secretary of State John Kerry said \u201cthe United States of America has already reduced its emissions more than any other country in the world.\u201d\n\nAs we pointed out then, the U.S., the second largest emitter of carbon pollution, reduced its emissions by 583 million metric tons between 2003 and 2012. That\u2019s more than any other country, according to Energy Information Administration data. But that\u2019s also a 10% reduction, and other nations including France (10.7%) and the United Kingdom (12.9%), to name a few, saw larger percentage reductions during that time period.\n\nMilitary Spending\n\nThe president said that the U.S. spends \u201cmore on our military than the next eight nations combined.\u201d That\u2019s not quite accurate but close enough in terms of raw dollars, based an April 2015 report by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute on military expenditures of the top 15 spenders.\n\nThat report shows that the U.S. spent $610 billion on defense in 2014, while the next eight nations spent a combined total of $646.4 billion. (The spending amounts for three of the eight countries \u2014 China, Russia and Germany \u2014 are estimates.)\n\nAlso, the report makes a couple of points worth noting, including that military spending in the U.S. has been on the decline while \u201cChina, Russia and Saudi Arabia continued to make substantial increases in military expenditures\u201d in 2014.\n\nStockholm International Peace Research Institute, April 2015: While the USA remains clearly the world\u2019s largest military spender, at nearly three times the level of second-placed China, its expenditure dropped by 6.5 percent in 2014, largely as a result of budget deficit control measures put in place by the US legislature under the 2011 Budget Control Act. US military spending is expected to fall again in 2015 but at a slower rate. \u2026 In 2014 China, Russia and Saudi Arabia were the second, third and fourth highest military spenders, respectively. China\u2019s expenditure rose by 9.7 percent, Russia\u2019s spending was up 8.1 percent and Saudi Arabia\u2019s by 17 percent.\n\nAlso, as a share of the nation\u2019s economy, the U.S. spends 3.5% of its gross domestic product \u2014 which is only the fourth highest of the top 15 countries. Saudi Arabia (10.4%), United Arab Emirates (5.4%) and Russia (4.5%) spend more on the military as a share of GDP than the United States.\n\nFor a full list of sources, see FactCheck.org.\n\nEugene Kiely, Brooks Jackson, Lori Robertson, Robert Farley and D\u2019Angelo Gore, FactCheck.org", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "President Obama&rsquo;s final State of the Union Address came up short of the facts on several topics.", "author": "TEGNA", "og": {"site_name": "KGW", "description": "President Obama\u2019s final State of the Union Address came up short of the facts on several topics.", "title": "Fact check: Obama's final State of the Union speech", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://content.kgw.com/photo/2016/01/13/obama%20sotu%20andrew%20scott%20usa%20today_1452696609248_47309_ver1.0_640_360.jpg", "height": 360}, "url": "http://www.kgw.com/news/fact-check-obamas-final-state-of-the-union-speech/14032720", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "http://www.kgw.com", "description": "President Obama\u2019s final State of the Union Address came up short of the facts on several topics.", "title": "Fact check: Obama's final State of the Union speech", "image": {"src": "http://content.kgw.com/photo/2016/01/13/obama%20sotu%20andrew%20scott%20usa%20today_1452696609248_47309_ver1.0_640_360.jpg"}, "site": "@KGWNews", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"app_id": 346859238673925}, "keywords": "News", "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1280"}, "article_summary": "\u201cAnd in the process, health care inflation has slowed.\u201dAs we have written severaltimesnow, health care spending has grown at historically low rates in recent years.\nFor 2014, the latest figure available, health care spending growth jumped up to 5.3% (see Table 1 of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services\u2019 health care expenditures data).\nAs we\u2019ve shown before, Obama\u2019s early initiatives increased FY 2009 spending \u2014 and thus the deficit \u2014 by as much as $203 billion.\n\u2022 He repeated his now years-long claim of crediting the Affordable Care Act for a slowdown in health care spending, which economists have linked mainly to the economy.\nBut Obama\u2019s 2009 speech, which the project notes was technically not a State of the Union, was only 51 minutes and 44 seconds."}
