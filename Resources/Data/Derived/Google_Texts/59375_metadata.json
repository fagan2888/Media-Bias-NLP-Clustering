As decision day approached, many ACA supporters (including me) suspected that the challengers\u2019 political appeal might only be overcome if one or two of the conservative justices\u2014Anthony Kennedy and/or Chief Justice John Roberts\u2014would embrace states rights\u2013based constitutional arguments to save the law.\n\nLast Thursday, when the Court issued its decision in the case, King v. Burwell, all these hopes and fears about the political and ideological vectors at play, specifically, with Roberts, turned out to be dead wrong. The chief justice had bigger fish to fry\u2014personal, institutional, and policy priorities\u2014that led him to uphold the Obama administration\u2019s decision to make tax credits available nationwide:\n\nAsserting his personal leadership of the Court, by mobilizing a 6-3 bipartisan majority, and taking the heat for writing a no-holds-barred, decisive opinion in the most politically divisive case on this year\u2019s docket;\n\nContinuing an ever more evident drive to advance the Court\u2019s power vis-\u00e0-vis the two elected branches, as the final decider and major direction-setter on the nation\u2019s most fought-over policy issues;\n\nSending a blunt message to conservative activists, lawyers, and politicians to stop abusing the judiciary as a handy back-door gimmick to reverse political defeats they have been unable to reverse in political arenas\u2014in particular, to stop bringing cases designed to \u201cundo\u201d the ACA;\n\nSending a subtle, gratuitous, but nevertheless quite discernible piece of policy advice to Republican politicians and policy-makers, in the form of a reminder of the ACA\u2019s Republican ancestry in Massachusetts\u2019 2006 Romneycare reform law, referencing that model\u2019s conservative credentials as a way to \u201cexpand coverage\u201d while relying on private health insurance markets.\n\nAs the litigation made its way toward the high court, ACA opponents had been upfront about their bet that conservatives on the bench shared, and would act on their animus to the president\u2019s signature legislative accomplishment. In September 2014, after the full D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals had voted to vacate and rehear a 2-1 decision in his favor, Carvin candidly opined that raw partisan politics would drive the Supreme Court to preempt the appellate court\u2019s consideration of the case: \"I don't know that four justices, who are needed to [grant review of the case] here . . . are going to give much of a damn about what a bunch of Obama appointees on the D.C. Circuit think.\u201d Asked if he believed he would lose the votes of any of the five conservative justices, he smiled and said, \"Oh, I don't think so.\u201d Carvin\u2019s cynical take was hardly unique; some of his allies openly forecast that Roberts would feel a need to appease conservatives who excoriated him for his 2012 vote to save the ACA.\n\nLast Thursday, Roberts dashed conservative hopes and liberal fears of a partisan political decision. To the contrary, as conservative blogger Josh Blackman ruefully explained on a Federalist Society post-mortem conference call, the decision effectively seemed to elevate the ACA into a kind of \u201cuntouchable super-statute that is beyond reach.\u201d Blackman characterized Roberts\u2019s message as, \u201cThis is over . . . We\u2019re through\u201d\u2014meaning, we\u2019re through hearing cases ginned up by our clever lawyer friends to precipitate judicial de facto repeal of the law. Roberts\u2019s brush-off of these core allies was foreshadowed by remarks he made at the University of Nebraska a few days before Carvin bared his cynical partisan take on the conservative justices. Then the chief justice said he was \u201cworried about people having [the] perception\u201d that the Court is no less a political body than Congress or the presidency. He attributed this trend to polarization in the elected branches, saying that he did not \u201cwant that to spill over and affect us.\u201d Though widely disregarded at the time as standard civics class pap, it now appears clear that Roberts was serious and motivated by clear-eyed concern about the Court\u2019s stature. As he observed in his 2005 confirmation hearings, \u201cIt is a very serious threat to the independence and integrity of the courts to politicize them.\u201d King v. Burwell posed just such an institutional threat, and it was his job as chief justice to dispel it.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "//assets.newrepublic.com/assets/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "When, just over two years ago, right-wing superlawyer Michael Carvin filed his first lawsuit seeking to deny Affordable Care Act tax credits to millions of individuals in states with federally operated exchanges, die-hard ACA opponents saw one reason why the Supreme Court might use an isolated four-word phrase to sabotage the ACA\u2014that all five conservative justices would vote their political gut. ...", "og": {"site_name": "New Republic", "description": "The chief justice's Obamacare opinion\u00a0is part of his plan to make the Supreme Court the final decider on the nation\u2019s most divisive policy issues.", "title": "John Roberts to America: I'm in Charge Here", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://images.newrepublic.com/739004cd706004d4b61d5e69acda4044bef08a31.jpeg?w=1109&h=577&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg", "url": "https://newrepublic.com/article/122188/john-roberts-america-im-charge-here", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://images.newrepublic.com/739004cd706004d4b61d5e69acda4044bef08a31.jpeg?w=1024&h=512&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg", "title": "John Roberts to America: I'm in Charge Here", "site": "@newrepublic", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "The chief justice's Obamacare opinion\u00a0is part of his plan to make the Supreme Court the final decider on the nation\u2019s most divisive policy issues."}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#ffffff", "parsely-metadata": "{\"thumb_image\":\"http://images.newrepublic.com/739004cd706004d4b61d5e69acda4044bef08a31.jpeg\"}", "parsely-page": "{\"title\":\"John Roberts to America: I'm in Charge Here\",\"link\":\"https://newrepublic.com/article/122188/john-roberts-america-im-charge-here\",\"section\":\"Obamacare\",\"pub_date\":\"2015-06-27T15:37:00.000Z\",\"post_id\":122188,\"author\":\"Simon Lazarus\",\"type\":\"post\",\"tags\":[\"Obamacare\",\"Politics\",\"Law\",\"Affordable Care Act\",\"Supreme Court\",\"Editors' Picks\",\"-type_article\"]}", "fb": {"admins": 4404589, "pages": 161419311535, "app_id": 1675346479369918}, "msapplication-TileImage": "//assets.newrepublic.com/assets/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/thenewrepublic", "tag": "Obamacare", "published_time": "2015-06-27"}, "theme-color": "#ffffff"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdcc83\"", "article_summary": "Last Thursday, Roberts dashed conservative hopes and liberal fears of a partisan political decision.\nRoberts\u2019s brush-off of these core allies was foreshadowed by remarks he made at the University of Nebraska a few days before Carvin bared his cynical partisan take on the conservative justices.\nThen the chief justice said he was \u201cworried about people having [the] perception\u201d that the Court is no less a political body than Congress or the presidency.\nare going to give much of a damn about what a bunch of Obama appointees on the D.C.\nWe\u2019re through\u201d\u2014meaning, we\u2019re through hearing cases ginned up by our clever lawyer friends to precipitate judicial de facto repeal of the law."}
