The gridlock seems never ending, the ruling-class mentality is ubiquitous, and Americans\u2019 contempt for Congress continues to soar. Enter: Rep. Ron DeSantis, R-Fla., who in his two short years as representative for Florida\u2019s 6th Congressional District has made it his mission to bring about reform in our nation\u2019s capital. But landing a seat in Congress was never something he had his sights set on.\n\nGrowing up, DeSantis always knew that working hard was the key to success in all aspects of life. Excelling at baseball opened the door to the Ivy Leagues for this self-described blue-collar kid, who, after graduating from Yale went on to pursue a law degree from Harvard. But it wasn\u2019t until after his time in the U.S. Navy where he served as a military prosecutor that he began to think about running for Congress.\n\n\u201cWhen President Obama took office I was transitioning out of the military and just seeing that he was taking the country in a direction that I didn\u2019t think was consistent with the Founding Fathers and with our constitutional roots,\u201d he tells Townhall. \u201cHaving served in Iraq and having seen in Guantanamo Bay some of the stuff first hand, I thought he was approaching it the wrong way and our party was in need of younger leaders, particularly veterans who would be able to carry a Reaganesque message going forward.\u201d\n\nFrom day one, that\u2019s exactly what DeSantis has been working to do.\n\nAs a freshman, he sought to prevent members of Congress and their staffers from receiving an exemption from Obamacare, thereby forcing them to abide by the same laws imposed on everyone else. While the effort did not succeed, it did go further than he imagined, he says.\n\nNow, his focus has shifted to ending pensions for future lawmakers and those currently in office who are not vested into the congressional retirement plan. \u201cThere are hardly any private sector employees who get both a 401k and a pension,\u201d DeSantis explains. \u201cThere\u2019s just no need that Congress should get both.\u201d\n\nThe road to reforming Washington is a long one, to be sure, and DeSantis is just beginning. In the future he hopes to offer ways forward on items such as term limits and a balanced budget amendment, to name just a couple. But how will he get others on board?\n\n\u201cThe key is to focus on some of the younger generation, people who have not been in Washington for 20 or 30 years,\u201d he says, \u201cbecause they can see more clearly the gap that has grown between the American people and what goes on inside the beltway, and I think that if they understand that, ideas like ending pensions in Congress ... click.\"\n\nGiven the congressman\u2019s determination to affect change in Washington, it should come as no surprise that he was one of nine founding members of the House Freedom Caucus, an invitation-only group that \u201cgives a voice to countless Americans who feel that Washington does not represent them,\u201d its mission statement reads.\n\nDeSantis hopes to use the group as a repository for reform ideas based on limited government principles.\n\n\u201cOne of the things that was missing from the 2014 election was a contract with America type of platform,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s a few things we know we\u2019re against but I don\u2019t think \u2026 party leadership has put forward a really coherent, positive agenda that reflects limited government principles, so I\u2019m going to be using that to get some like-minded people together and start turning out ideas.\u201d\n\nBecause Obama\u2019s policies have failed, the new group will have plenty of opportunities to address budget and spending issues, the rising costs of higher education, devolving transportation and highway spending to the state, and other important matters, he explains.\n\nBut that\u2019s not all this Florida congressman is focused on. As the Chairman of the Subcommittee on National Security, protecting the American people and holding the country\u2019s national security agencies accountable are also top priorities.\n\nEven when he\u2019s away from Washington, however, DeSantis says he spends most of his time reading up on issues and different bills they\u2019re considering for the committees he\u2019s on.\n\nServing the American people is a 24-7 job, but one DeSantis is proud to do.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Serving the American people is a 24-7 job, but one Rep.
