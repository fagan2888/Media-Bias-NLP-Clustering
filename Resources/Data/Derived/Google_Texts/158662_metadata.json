The company it expected its shares to list on July 10.\n\nPartner Shire has committed to buying 12 million euros of new shares at the offer price. Certain existing shareholders have also committed to buying up to 10 million euros worth of shares.\n\nThe funds raised would be used to advance clinical trials of its antibodies, initially targeting rare diseases, arGEN-X said. The data may support the antibodies finding pharmaceutical company partners for a wide range of major indications.\n\nThe company has hired KBC Securities and Kempen & Co as joint global coordinators and joint bookrunners for the offering, Petercam as co-lead manager, and Wedbush PacGrow Life Sciences as selling agent.\n\nLike its peer Ablynx, which also has a research facility in Ghent, Belgium, arGEN-X bases its technology on the immune system of llamas. Unlike Ablynx it does not use tiny nanobody technology.\n\nThe company has two candidate drugs in clinical trials and others in pre-clinical development and has signed partnerships with major pharmaceutical groups such as Shire, Bayer and Boehringer Ingelheim.\n\nThe group said that if successful, these partnerships could trigger milestone payments of 1.3 billion euros.
