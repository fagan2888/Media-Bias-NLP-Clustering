The health workers operating the state\u2019s new needle exchange program, meanwhile, are emphasizing that distributing clean needles doesn\u2019t encourage people to do more drugs.\n\nIndiana\u2019s health commissioner, Jerome Adams, recently penned a piece for the Indy Star detailing some of the most common myths about HIV he\u2019s been hearing during the current outbreak. He reported that, in addition to worrying about contracting the virus from casual contact, people are also under the impression that HIV is the same thing as AIDS and HIV is always a death sentence.\n\nAdams noted that many of these misconceptions have been circling since 1984, when Indiana resident Ryan White \u2014 one of the first U.S. children to be diagnosed with AIDS \u2014 fought for his right to continue attending school as concerned parents worried their children would catch the disease by sharing a drinking fountain with him.\n\nThe information gap is hardly contained to Indiana. As recently as last year, national polling from the Kaiser Family Foundation found that 34 percent of Americans believe at least one myth about HIV transmission. Eleven percent of respondents, for instance, said that HIV can be spread by swimming in a pool with someone who\u2019s infected, while 27 percent said you can get the virus by sharing a drinking glass.\n\nAnd, more than a quarter century after Ryan White\u2019s fight, schools in Arkansas and Pennsylvania have recently made national headlines for denying children entry to school because of concerns that they might be HIV-positive. Although the Americans with Disabilities Act prohibits public schools from banning children simply based on their HIV status, the controversies in this area betray a continued reluctance to integrate HIV-positive individuals with other people who don\u2019t have the virus.\n\nAdvocacy organizations and public health experts have continued to attempt to challenge the misinformation that swirls around HIV. Some groups have worked to document a day in the life of people with HIV to combat the stigma that often accompanies an HIV-positive status. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention launched a \u201cLet\u2019s Stop HIV Together\u201d campaign to feature people from diverse walks of life who are all successfully managing the virus, in an effort to make HIV more visible now that it isn\u2019t the same death sentence that it was in the 1980s.\n\nAnd this month, a small Austrian men\u2019s magazine made a dramatic statement by printing an entire issue using HIV-positive blood. The magazine is safe to touch because the virus, which can only be transmitted through direct contact with bodily fluids, dies quickly outside the body. The publishers hope it will force people to confront their long-standing assumptions about HIV.\n\n\u201cIf you see the magazine\u2026 the first question that comes to your mind is, \u2018Would I touch it? Would I take it in my hands?\u2019 \u201d the co-publisher of the magazine, Julian Wiehl, told the Washington Post. \u201cAnd the second question is, \u2018Why would I touch it?\u2019 or \u2018Why wouldn\u2019t I touch it?\u2019 \u201d\n\nIn Indiana specifically, young people are stepping up to the plate to disseminate accurate information about HIV. At Austin High School, located in the heart of the recent outbreak, rumors spread quickly through the hallways about how easy it is to catch HIV \u2014 so, in response, student leaders scrambled to assemble a special edition of their school newspaper filled with information about the reality of the virus.\n\n\u201cI was like, \u2018Well, we\u2019re going to have to do something about it so everyone\u2019s aware of what\u2019s going on around them. Because we\u2019re living in it,\u201d Holli Reynolds, the school\u2019s homecoming queen and one of the students who worked on the paper, told PBS Newshour.\n\nReynolds also helped found a new group called \u201cStand Up\u201d to help educate her peers about HIV infection and teach them how to stay healthy. The meetings are targeted at kids between second and eighth grade, but they\u2019re also open to the public.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "Misinformation about HIV transmission is still widespread.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "Misinformation about HIV transmission is still widespread.", "title": "Indiana\u2019s Record-Breaking HIV Outbreak Revives Decades-Old Misconceptions", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/health/2015/05/06/3655499/indiana-outbreak-hiv-stigma/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/hiv.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Misinformation about HIV transmission is still widespread.", "creator": "@Tara_CR", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/hiv-321x214.jpg", "title": "Indiana\u2019s Record-Breaking HIV Outbreak Revives Decades-Old Misconceptions", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-health", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/hiv.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/hiv.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2015-05-06T10:15:36+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/tculpressler"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "Health Indiana\u2019s Record-Breaking HIV Outbreak Revives Decades-Old Misconceptions CREDIT: AP Photo/Darron Cummings Information brochures are on display inside of Austin Community Outreach Center, in the heart of Indiana's current HIV outbreakAs Indiana struggles to address the worst HIV outbreak in the state\u2019s history, public health officials are encountering decades-old misconceptions about a virus that has a complicated relationship with stigma and shame.\nAdvocacy organizations and public health experts have continued to attempt to challenge the misinformation that swirls around HIV.\nIndiana\u2019s health commissioner, Jerome Adams, recently penned a piece for the Indy Star detailing some of the most common myths about HIV he\u2019s been hearing during the current outbreak.\nReynolds also helped found a new group called \u201cStand Up\u201d to help educate her peers about HIV infection and teach them how to stay healthy.\nAnd this month, a small Austrian men\u2019s magazine made a dramatic statement by printing an entire issue using HIV-positive blood."}
