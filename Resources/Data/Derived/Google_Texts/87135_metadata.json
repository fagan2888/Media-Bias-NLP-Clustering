California Teachers Association, leaving in place agency fees public employees pay to public-sector unions and delivering a victory to labor organizations.\n\nBut Friedrichs and her legal team contend that their challenge to unions is hardly over. Rather, the 28-year California teacher told reporters she was prepared for a split ruling from the Supreme Court, and now, she and her legal team are planning to file a petition for a rehearing with the high court.\n\n\u201cAll of us plaintiffs have been in the classroom for a very long time, so we\u2019re very patient people, and we are definitely in this for the long haul,\u201d Friedrichs told reporters. \u201cToday\u2019s decision isn\u2019t the end of the case, and in our view, it simply just delays the final outcome.\u201d\n\nFriedrichs\u2019 case challenged the agency fees that public workers must pay to unions to fund collective bargaining negotiations. At the heart of the case is a question of whether those agency fees violate public employees\u2019 First Amendment rights to free speech.\n\nPublic-sector workers can opt out of paying full union dues, but they must pay agency fees to fund collective bargaining negotiations. Friedrichs and her fellow educators argue that collective bargaining is inherently political, since many of the positions unions take during negotiations with school administrators reflect their political choices.\n\n\u201cThis is not an anti-union case. This case is about protecting the individual rights that each of us are guaranteed in the Constitution, and that includes the right to not fund political positions with which we disagree,\u201d Friedrichs said. \u201cI am aware that some of my teacher colleagues agree with the union on issues that are political and collectively bargained, and I support their right to be part of the union.\n\n\u201cI just also believe that I deserve to have the freedom to choose, as do other public sector employees across the nation.\u201d\n\nThe Supreme Court heard oral arguments in the Friedrichs case in January. Following the arguments, court observers speculated that the high court would rule 5-4 in favor of Friedrichs and her fellow teachers.\n\nComments previously made by Justice Antonin Scalia left many assuming he would cast the swing vote, but his questions during oral arguments suggested he would side with Friedrichs.\n\nScalia\u2019s death last month cast doubt on the outcome of the case, as a 4-4 decision became more likely.\n\nFollowing the justice\u2019s passing, lawyers with the Center for Individual Rights, which along with lead counsel Michael Carvin of Jones Day is representing Friedrichs, urged the Supreme Court to hear the case again.\n\nTerry Pell, president of the Center for Individual Rights, told The Daily Signal in February they would file a petition for rehearing in the event that the court is split in its decision.\n\nPell reiterated today that plan to do so.\n\n\u201cWe obviously have a lot invested in the Friedrichs case,\u201d Pell told reporters. \u201cWe think it raises the issue in a clear and clean way and allows the court to decide this issue on the merits. So we think it would be a lost opportunity if the court did not decide Friedrichs in an authoritative way, and that\u2019s why we\u2019re investing further effort to make sure the court has the opportunity to at least decide the case with all nine justices.\u201d\n\nA split decision from the high court leaves in place a 2014 ruling from the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.\n\nThe lower court ruled against Friedrichs\u2014which her lawyers asked them to do\u2014in 2014, citing precedent set by the 1977 case Abood v. Detroit Board of Education.\n\nIn that case, the Supreme Court ruled that public-sector workers can opt out of paying full union dues but still have to pay agency fees to fund their \u201cfair share\u201d of collective bargaining arguments.\n\nBecause of the Abood case, Friedrichs\u2019 legal team said the case can be decided only by the Supreme Court.\n\nA decision in favor of Friedrichs from the Supreme Court would\u2019ve delivered a blow to public-sector unions, as it would\u2019ve effectively made union dues optional for all public employees.\n\nThough the Supreme Court\u2019s decision today allows public-sector unions in 23 states to continue collecting agency fees from public workers, Pell said that it is in the best interest of both unions and Friedrichs for the high court to rehear the case.\n\n\u201cThere are laws at stake here,\u201d he said. \u201cUnions feel strongly about this, and it would be in the union\u2019s best interest to get an authoritative decision, since if we don\u2019t get an authoritative decision, there are cases that could be filed at any time, and the unions are essentially under a cloud in terms of the constitutionality of their method of collecting dues.\u201d\n\nPell said it\u2019s not uncommon for the Supreme Court to rehear cases, particularly in the event that a justice leaves in the middle of a term. Landmark cases including Brown v. Board of Education and Roe v. Wade were reheard by the court, he said.\n\nAfter Friedrichs\u2019 legal team file the petition for rehearing, they expect the court to hold the petition until a new justice is confirmed.\n\nOnce that occurs, the nine justices will decide whether to rehear the case.\n\n\u201cThe idea here is that there are a handful of cases that raise really fundamental issues of individual rights and that deeply divide the country, and this is one of those cases,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about the laws in 23 states that would be struck down, and we\u2019re talking about the free speech rights of tens of thousands of public employees.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Supreme Court issued a 4-4 ruling in the case Friedrichs v.
