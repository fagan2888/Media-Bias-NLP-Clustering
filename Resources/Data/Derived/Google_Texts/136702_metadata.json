I think this is a reiteration of something that happened 10 years ago.\"\n\nLawyers who look for plaintiffs in cases they seek to have certified as class actions often rely on news reports, which can attract potential clients. \"I hate to say it,\" Morrison said, \"but that's a way to troll.\"\n\nBarry L. Kramer, a lawyer formerly from California and now in Las Vegas, drafted the lawsuit against Sanford. He said he was motivated to take such cases after a client walked into his office with a $15,000 bill for an overnight hospital stay.\n\nA solo practitioner, Kramer's office maintains a website announcing that he is \"investigating excessive hospital fees,\" and providing a way for people to contact him if they have visited a hospital or emergency room while uninsured.\n\nKramer's website invites people to submit information under the heading \"Hospital Overcharges Class Actions\" and says that about 1 million patients have received refunds or adjustments to their hospital bills as a result of class-action settlements that have resulted in payments totaling almost $1 billion from hospitals to patients who he said were overcharged.\n\nClass-action lawsuits alleging hospital overcharges are pending in at least four states, including California, New Jersey, West Virginia and Washington.\n\n\"Just because you get class certification doesn't mean you're going to win the case on the merits of the law or facts,\" Richard said, adding that there are \"lots of hoops\" to be granted class-action status.\n\nThe lawsuit against Sanford was brought on behalf of Dustin Limberg of Fargo. His complaint said he went in January to the emergency room at Sanford, where he signed a contract agreeing he was responsible for all charges for services provided by the hospital.\n\nThose charges, Limberg's lawsuit said, are based on \"chargemaster\" rates, a list of costs for services the hospital maintains to negotiate with public and private health insurers for all services provided.\n\nBut patients without insurance don't benefit from negotiated rates. In Limberg's case, he received a $2,062 bill for his ER visit, an amount the lawsuit contends is \"grossly excessive, unfair and unconscionable for the services provided.\"\n\nHospital emergency rooms are barred by federal law from discussing their charges or asking patients about their ability to pay, Richard said. Charges are universal, but rates are negotiated, he said.\n\nPatients, even those with insurance, can apply for financial assistance. If they are able to demonstrate financial need, they can have part or all of their bill waived.\n\nLast year, Sanford provided $323 million in charity care, including $83 million in Fargo, Richard said. \"So it's a big number.\"\n\nThe issue isn't whether the charges are unfair, Richard said, it's whether they're illegal. The Affordable Care Act is allowing more people to obtain health insurance.\n\n\"You're asking judges and juries to decide a charge for each and every patient,\" Morrison said, referring to the wave of class-action lawsuits against hospitals. \"That doesn't make sense.\"\n\nHospitals usually settle cases like those brought by Limberg, said his attorney, Kramer.\n\n\"The hospitals don't want to take these losing cases to trial they're certain to lose,\" he said, adding that he has been successful in overcoming motions to dismiss cases. He did not say how much money he has recovered for his clients.\n\nFor the past six or seven years, Kramer said, \"I've worked on nothing but these cases.\"", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "News,Health,courts,North Dakota,Cass County District Court,Sanford Health,hospital charges,emergency room,lawsuit,Class action", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Patrick Springer", "og": {"site_name": "INFORUM", "description": "FARGO \u2013 A lawsuit accusing Sanford Health of \"grossly excessive\" charges for emergency room services is part of a litigation boom by trial lawyers whose cases are overwhelmingly thrown out by judges, Sanford executives said.", "title": "Sanford speaks out about lawsuit alleging 'grossly excessive'...", "url": "http://www.inforum.com/news/3802541-sanford-speaks-out-about-lawsuit-alleging-grossly-excessive-er-charges", "image": {"width": 300, "identifier": "http://www.inforum.com/sites/default/files/styles/square_300/public/field/image/SanfordResearchCenter_4.jpg?itok=Co7DNY8i", "height": 300}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "FARGO \u2013 A lawsuit accusing Sanford Health of \"grossly excessive\" charges for emergency room services is part of a litigation boom by trial lawyers whose cases are overwhelmingly thrown out by judges, Sanford executives said.", "title": "Sanford speaks out about lawsuit alleging 'grossly excessive'...", "url": "http://www.inforum.com/news/3802541-sanford-speaks-out-about-lawsuit-alleging-grossly-excessive-er-charges", "image": "http://www.inforum.com/sites/default/files/styles/16x9_430/public/field/image/SanfordResearchCenter_4.jpg?itok=LsGyUfW6", "site": "inforum", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1451861908361756}, "keywords": "News,Health,courts,North Dakota,Cass County District Court,Sanford Health,hospital charges,emergency room,lawsuit,Class action", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/inforumFM", "tag": "News,Health,courts,North Dakota,Cass County District Court,Sanford Health,hospital charges,emergency room,lawsuit,Class action", "modified_time": "2015-07-22T22:30:11-05:00"}, "image": {"alt": "Sanford's corporate headquarters in Sioux Falls.
