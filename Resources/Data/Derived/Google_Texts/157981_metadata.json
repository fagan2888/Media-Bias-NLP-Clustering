Ted Cruz, R-Texas, who has assiduously courted evangelicals throughout his presidential run, will take a lead role in the launch this week of an ambitious 50-state campaign to end taxpayer support for Planned Parenthood \u2014 a move that is likely to give the GOP candidate a major primary-season boost in the fierce battle for social-conservative and evangelical voters.\n\nMore than 100,000 pastors received e-mail invitations over the weekend to participate in conference calls with Cruz on Tuesday in which they will learn details of the plan to mobilize churchgoers in every congressional district beginning Aug. 30. The requests were sent on the heels of the Texas Republican\u2019s \u201cRally for Religious Liberty,\u201d which drew 2,500 people to a Des Moines ballroom Friday.\n\n\u201cThe recent exposure of Planned Parenthood\u2019s barbaric practices . . . has brought about a pressing need to end taxpayer support of this institution,\u201d Cruz said in the e-mail call to action distributed by the American Renewal Project, an organization of conservative pastors.\n\nThe push comes as Cruz seeks to grab a decisive edge in a crowded primary-within-a-primary, with half a dozen GOP contenders battling for what he has referred to as \u201cthe evangelical bracket.\u201d\n\nRoughly 1 in 4 voters have identified themselves as evangelical in exit polls from the 2004 campaign on. In key Republican primaries such as Iowa, and in some of the Southern states that Cruz has said are critical to his run, that figure was higher during the last presidential campaign \u2014 nearly 50 percent.\n\nCruz has consistently pointed to his ability to motivate and mobilize those voters as a key element of his 2016 strategy. Earlier this summer, he said repeatedly that his main bases of support were tea party voters \u2014 and religious conservatives.\n\n\u201cI think my natural second bracket is the evangelical bracket,\u2019\u2019 he told the Raleigh, N.C., News & Observer. He ticked off the rivals he viewed as his competition for that demographic: There was former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee, who he described as \u201clikable . . . affable . . . a Southern Baptist minister,\u201d along with former senator from Pennsylvania Rick Santorum, former Texas Gov. Rick Perry, Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal and neurologist Ben Carson. \u201cI think at the end of the day, Huckabee and I come out of that bracket neck and neck,\" he predicted.\n\nHeading into the primary season, it wasn\u2019t clear how significant a role social issues would play in the ultimate selection of the Republican nominee. But social conservatives and evangelical voters say they have been galvanized by a one-two punch this summer: first, the Supreme Court\u2019s decision that same-sex marriage should be legal in all 50 states \u2014 and then, the release of hidden-camera videos showing Planned Parenthood officials discussing the donation of fetal tissue in a seemingly cavalier fashion.\n\nAll of the Republican candidates have found themselves spending more trail time on both issues over the past few months. Those fighting most fiercely for religious voters have made them central to their campaigns. But few candidates have made the burgeoning \u201creligious liberty\u201d movement in opposition to same-sex marriage, and the fight to deny funding to Planned Parenthood, as much of their campaign centerpiece as Cruz has \u2014 and perhaps no one is as well-positioned to benefit politically from a renewed focus on those issues.\n\nOn the campaign trail, Cruz has urged people to watch the controversial Planned Parenthood videos and has repeatedly attacked the Supreme Court, where he once served as a law clerk. In an op-ed in USA Today on Thursday, Cruz wrote that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell shouldn\u2019t schedule or allow any legislation to be heard that would give federal money to Planned Parenthood.\n\nCruz and Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul have each proposed defunding Planned Parenthood and suggested that they would let the government shut down before yielding. Any shutdown would be the fault of Democrats, who\u2019d have to be \u201cwilling to try to shut down the government in order to force continued taxpayer funding from an organization that has now been caught on film apparently admitting to multiple felonies,\u201d Cruz, who shot to conservative stardom when he led an effort to shut down the government over funding for the Affordable Care Act, told reporters earlier this month.\n\nAt his religious liberty-themed rally in Des Moines on Friday night, Cruz cast himself as the only choice for evangelical voters. There is a \u201cwar on faith,\u201d he said, as he quoted scripture and paced the stage like a televangelist; evangelical voters will \u201cstay home no longer.\u201d\n\nIn the Iowa ballroom that night, Cruz interviewed Dick and Betty Odgaard, an Iowa Mennonite couple who became icons in the religious liberty movement after they refused to hold a same-sex wedding at their events space, which has since closed; he held Betty Odgaard\u2019s hand as she cried, recounting the ordeal. He called to the stage other \u201cheroes\u201d who said their religious liberty had been violated, including an Oregon couple who refused to bake a wedding cake for a same-sex couple and a former Atlanta fire chief who said he was fired after releasing a self-published book where he said homosexuality was a \u201cperversion\u201d and morally equivalent to \u201cpederasty\u201d and \u201cbestiality,\u201din a setting that was part church service, part talk show.\n\nAnd he recounted his legal experience winning religious liberty cases, such as his fight as Texas solicitor general to keep a Ten Commandments monument on the grounds of the state capitol, decided by a 5-4 Supreme Court margin. The high court, he argued, is one justice away from taking down all images of God.\n\n\u201cIs the next victim of persecution your pastor?\u201d Cruz asked the crowd. \u201cYour charity, where you volunteer your time at a crisis pregnancy center?\u201d\n\nCruz\u2019s Iowa campaign chairman, Matt Schultz, suggested Cruz was divinely chosen to lead.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re at a crossroads in our country,\u201d Schultz told the crowd. \u201cTed Cruz is the man who God has prepared for this moment in time to be our champion, to fight for our husbands, our wives, our children and our grandchildren, for our country.\u201d\n\nThe message resonated with undecided voters on hand like Jerry Miller, 65, of West Des Moines, Iowa, who said the country needs a president who will put faith at the fore \u2014 a president like Cruz. \u201cWe need to put this country back to what it was founded on, Judeo-Christian values,\u201d he said.\n\nCruz drew some of his loudest cheers when he took on Planned Parenthood. \u201cInnocent life should not be treated as a business transaction,\u201d he said, repeating a pledge that, if elected president, he would instruct the Department of Justice to investigate and potentially prosecute the organization.\n\nIn the e-mail sent to pastors this weekend, Cruz urged individuals to take on the organization on another front. \u201cI am urging you to confront this evil in our nation by praying and preaching with an unbridled passion until funding for Planned Parenthood ends, and this barbaric practice is purged from the land,\u201d Cruz wrote in his message.\n\nPlanned Parenthood\u2019s executive vice president, Dawn Laguens, expressed concern about the latest push, Cruz\u2019s role and the portrayal of her organization in the videos, produced and distributed in recent weeks by an antiabortion group called the Center for Medical Progress.\n\n\u201cFrom the beginning, this relentless campaign has been about one thing: antiabortion extremists who will do anything \u2014 lie, twist facts, villainize providers, and even reportedly break the law \u2014 in their quest to ban abortion and block millions from accessing basic reproductive health care,\u201d she said in a statement to the Post. \u201cTed Cruz is pushing the Republican party into territory that\u2019s further and further away from what the majority of American voters believe.\u201d\n\nThe latest salvo against the group is being organized by some of the Christian conservative movement\u2019s best-known strategists, including three who helped lead a successful effort to recall state Supreme Court judges in Iowa in 2010 after the jurists ruled in favor of same-sex marriage.\n\n\u201cThis is tremendously larger than what happened in Iowa,\u201d said David Carney, a Republican strategist who worked on that recall effort with David Lane, who leads the American Renewal Project, a group sponsoring this week\u2019s pastor outreach effort. The two are joined by Wayne Hamilton, a Texas-based organizer who has worked in the past with Perry and was campaign manager in 2014 for Texas Gov. Greg Abbott. The effort appears to be funded through American Renewal, which officials said spent about $10 million supporting candidates in 2014 and is considered likely to spend $15 million or more this year organizing opposition to abortion and gay marriage.\n\nIn addition, religious broadcast organizations have pledged to air public service spots urging Christian viewers to contact their members of Congress. Carney said the effort has received commitments of support from the Bott Radio Network, which has 100 Christian radio station in the Midwest, and from American Family Radio, which owns 190 Christian radio stations in 20 states as well as national religious-television broadcasters.\n\nThe Tuesday conference calls with pastors will begin with a message from Cruz, who will be followed on the call by Doug Stringer, a pastor who works with American Renewal and Response USA to plan statewide prayer rallies at the request of conservative governors such as Jindal and Perry.\n\nCruz\u2019s campaign believes that, more than any other candidate in the race, it has the grass-roots infrastructure in place to harness the support of conservatives, evangelicals and insurgent voters nationwide \u2014 and the resources to translate that support into votes, as Huckabee\u2019s poll numbers sag, and the surging Carson continues to lack the fundraising muscle to take advantage of his late summer momentum.\n\nThe latest reports filed with the FEC show Cruz trailing only Jeb Bush in fundraising \u2014 ahead of Paul, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio. Through June, Cruz had raised $14 million through his campaign committee and another $37 million through a constellation of super PACs set up to aid his campaign.\n\nCruz\u2019s campaign has spent the past few months mobilizing his base, assembling coalitions and courting activists on the ground in Iowa and elsewhere. The candidate spent mid-August on a 20-stop, seven-day bus tour across the South that included events at multiple churches, and his campaign announced Friday that it intends to have a pastor doing faith outreach in all 99 of Iowa\u2019s counties. Cruz\u2019s father Rafael, a pastor, has been traveling the country all year speaking to voters of faith.Now that effort will be broadcast nationwide.\n\n\u201cYou wonder why we have a federal government that comes after our free-speech rights, that comes after our religious liberty, that comes after life, that comes after marriage, that comes after our values,\u201d Cruz said Friday, blaming that state of affairs again on the 54 million evangelicals who stayed home during the 2012 presidential election.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m here to tell you, we will stay home no longer,\u201d Cruz said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "U.S. Sen.&nbsp;Ted Cruz, R-Texas, will take a lead role in the launch this week of an ambitious 50-state campaign to&nbsp;end taxpayer support&nbsp;for Planned&nbsp;Parenthood.", "parsely-title": "Cruz to Play Lead Role in Fifty-State Attack on Planned Parenthood", "twitter": {"description": "U.S. Sen.&nbsp;Ted Cruz, R-Texas, will take a lead role in the launch this week of an ambitious 50-state campaign to&nbsp;end taxpayer support&nbsp;for Planned&nbsp;Parenthood.", "title": "Cruz to Play Lead Role in Fifty-State Attack on Planned Parenthood", "url": "https://www.texastribune.org/2015/08/23/cruz-lead-50-state-attack-planned-parenthood/", "image": "https://static.texastribune.org/media/images/2015/08/21/Cruz_at_RALLY_FOR_RELIGIOUS_LIBERTY_jpg_407x1000_q100.jpg", "creator": "@evanasmith", "site": "@TexasTribune", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 154122474650943, "pages": 124434790836}, "og": {"site_name": "The Texas Tribune", "description": "U.S. Sen.&nbsp;Ted Cruz, R-Texas, will take a lead role in the launch this week of an ambitious 50-state campaign to&nbsp;end taxpayer support&nbsp;for Planned&nbsp;Parenthood.", "title": "Cruz to Play Lead Role in Fifty-State Attack on Planned Parenthood", "url": "https://www.texastribune.org/2015/08/23/cruz-lead-50-state-attack-planned-parenthood/", "image": "https://static.texastribune.org/media/images/2015/08/21/Cruz_at_RALLY_FOR_RELIGIOUS_LIBERTY_jpg_800x1000_q100.jpg", "type": "article"}, "parsely-tags": "Ted Cruz,Planned Parenthood,2016 Presidential Election", "parsely-author": "Evan Smith", "parsely-section": "front-page", "parsely-type": "post", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/texastribune/"}, "parsely-pub-date": "Aug. 23, 2015, 2:08 p.m.", "parsely-image-url": "https://static.texastribune.org/media/images/2015/08/21/Cruz_at_RALLY_FOR_RELIGIOUS_LIBERTY_jpg_407x1000_q100.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "parsely-link": "http://www.texastribune.org/2015/08/23/cruz-lead-50-state-attack-planned-parenthood/"}, "article_summary": "Cruz and Kentucky Sen.
