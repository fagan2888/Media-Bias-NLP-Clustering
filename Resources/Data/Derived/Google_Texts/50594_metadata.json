That some on the left can so casually traffic in such slander reflects nothing but their own bigotry against conservatives.\n\nIf you asked me, I\u2019d have said that was self-evident. (As a right-winger with kids of different colors, I may be biased.) But Jim Lindgren, a law professor and sociologist at Northwestern University, decided to double-check. He turned to the General Social Survey, a comprehensive national survey that for years has been compiling sociodemographic statistics on US residents \u2014 including (among many variables) data on respondents\u2019 political leanings and the racial makeup of their families.\n\nNot surprisingly, Lindgren found, there was nothing in the data to back up MSNBC\u2019s suggestion that conservatives are more likely than liberals to frown on biracial families.\n\n\u201cAmong families with step-children or adopted children,\u201d he wrote for The Volokh Conspiracy, a legal blog hosted by The Washington Post, \u201c11 percent of conservatives were living in mixed-race households compared to 10 percent of liberals.\u201d Broadening the analysis to include families with biological children of an interracial couple (like Gracie in the Cheerios spot), Lindgren found that 11.9 percent of self-identified conservatives live in mixed-race families compared to 11.4 percent of liberals. When the numbers were sorted by party affiliation, they showed 9.5 percent of Republicans living in mixed-race families vs. 11.2 percent of Democrats. Crunching the stats by both race and ideology, 2.0 percent of white conservatives live in mixed-race families, while 2.4 percent of white liberals do.\n\nNone of these differences are statistically significant. Taken together, they reinforce the ugliness of MSNBC\u2019s taunting insinuation that to be politically right-of-center is to be racially intolerant, or that there is something inherently liberal in forging ties of love across the color line.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut there is also a message here that conservatives and Republicans should be taking to heart, one that has nothing to do with liberal closed-mindedness.\n\nIn the ongoing debate over immigration reform, there are reasonable arguments on all sides \u2014 arguments about the economic, social, and environmental impact of increasing the number of immigrants, sealing the US-Mexican border, or offering amnesty to illegal immigrants. What is not a reasonable argument, it seems to me, is the claim that more immigrants must mean fewer Republicans.\n\n\u201cAt the current accelerated rate of immigration \u2014 1.1 million new immigrants every year \u2014 Republicans will be a fringe party in about a decade,\u201d writes Ann Coulter in a recent column. She cites a wide swath of polling data showing that most immigrants not only come from \u201csocieties that are far more left-wing than our own,\u201d but that \u201cthey bring their cultures with them.\u201d Hispanic and Asian immigrants may have little in common economically or culturally, but \u201cboth overwhelmingly support big government, Obamacare, affirmative action, and gun control . . . How are Republicans going to square that circle?\u201d\n\nBut that kind of essentialist argument is as flawed as the claim that interracial families must be left-wing, or that a conservative message of liberty, opportunity, and patriotism can only appeal to voters with white skin.\n\nFor more than half a century after the Civil War, blacks were a solid Republican constituency, and the most Democratic-leaning states were the most hostile to black voting rights. Yet attitudes change \u2014 sometimes for good reasons, sometimes not \u2014 and voting patterns with them. Political values aren\u2019t coded in our DNA. Party loyalty isn\u2019t a function of immigration status.\n\nWhere do you stand on amnesty? Whom you support for president? Would you ever watch MSNBC? If you\u2019re looking for the answers in the color of your skin, you\u2019re definitely doing it wrong.", "article_metadata": {"eomportal-loid": "3.2.2270355252", "eomportal-id": 697229, "description": "A few days before the Super Bowl, an obnoxious tweet implying that \u201crightwing\u201d conservatives are such bigots that they were bound to \u201chate\u201d a Cheerios commercial featuring a biracial couple and their adorable daughter, Gracie.
