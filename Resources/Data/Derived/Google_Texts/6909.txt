A doctor recently tried to give a letter to David Cameron criticising his 7-day NHS plans, but the police at Downing Street refused to pass her correspondence on.

However Janis Burns’ letter has now had a greater impact than she could have ever imagined, having been read and shared thousands of times after she posted it online.

In her witty letter Janis, 34, takes shots at the PM for his ‘inflation busting pay rise’, and informs him of the gruelling hours she is forced to work, mocking the belief that the NHS isn’t a 24-hour service.

Check out Janis’ full letter below:

Whether it’s the low levels of pay (Janis claims some doctors make less than a Pret a Manger manager), or the anti-social hours, Janis has given David Cameron and health secretary Jeremy Hunt a lot to think about.

Her letter comes as NHS staff have been flooding Twitter with images and anecdotes explaining just how hard their job is, using the hashtag #ImInWorkJeremy.
