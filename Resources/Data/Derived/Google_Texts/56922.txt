MONROVIA, Liberia (AP) — A Liberian doctor who was among three Africans to receive an experimental Ebola drug has died, the country’s information minister said Monday.

Dr. Abraham Borbor, the deputy chief medical doctor at the country’s largest hospital, had been among three Liberians, and the first Africans, who received the drug, ZMapp. Two Americans received the untested drug and survived. A Spaniard infected with Ebola received the treatment but died. There was no update given on the two other Liberians who took doses of the drug.

Borbor “was showing signs of improvement but yesterday he took a turn for the worse,” Information Minister Lewis Brown told The Associated Press. It wasn’t clear if he died late Sunday or on Monday.

Ebola has killed more than 1,400 people across West Africa. There is no proven vaccine or cure for the disease that can cause a grisly death with bleeding from the eyes, mouth and ears.
