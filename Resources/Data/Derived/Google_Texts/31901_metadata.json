I doubt it\u2019s necessary,\u201d state Sen. Dick Sears, D-Bennington, told Vermont Watchdog.\n\nThe statement echoes comments recently made by Gov. Peter Shumlin.\n\n\u201cMy view on gun laws is that Vermont has the guns laws right now that serve us well. I want to keep the ones we got in place, I don\u2019t think we need new laws,\u201d Shumlin told ABC Local 22 at the Yankee Sportsman\u2019s Classic in Essex Junction.\n\nWhile Vermont has among the highest gun ownership per capita, recent FBI crime statistics show the state is the safest in the nation. In 2013, the Green Mountain State had 115 violent crimes per 100,000 residents, well below the national average of 368 violent crimes for every 100,000 people.\n\nSears, who is chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said background checks don\u2019t pass the common sense test.\n\n\u201cIf I want to give a neighbor my gun, and I\u2019m not hunting anymore, I shouldn\u2019t have to go to a gun shop in order to do a background check on my neighbor, who I\u2019ve known for 30 years. And if I give my gun to some felon, that\u2019s my own fault, and I can already be held accountable for that under various laws in civil court,\u201d he said.\n\nGun Sense Vermont, a well-financed anti-gun group advocating the background checks, argues legislation is necessary to \u201cclose a loophole\u201d that allows the mentally ill, domestic abusers and felons to buy guns through private sales, over the Internet and at gun shows.\n\nAlthough Gun Sense claims to be a grassroots organization, the group\u2019s legislative effort is being promoted nationwide by Michael Bloomberg\u2019s Everytown for Gun Safety.\n\nBloomberg announced last April he would spend $50 million to back gun control efforts in states.\n\nBut state background checks might not be constitutional in Vermont, Sears said.\n\n\u201cA lot of people don\u2019t realize there\u2019s a section in the Vermont Constitution regarding the ownership of firearms that, as I read it, is much more liberal towards the gun owner than the U.S. Constitution,\u201d Sears said.\n\n\u201cPeople say, \u2018It\u2019s a violation of the Second Amendment.\u2019 I think the 16th Article of the Vermont Constitution also needs to be read in any of these decisions we make.\u201d\n\nThe article to which Sears refers is unambiguous: \u201cThe people have a right to bear arms for the defense of themselves and the State.\u201d\n\nThat single clause, which has existed since Vermont was an independent republic in 1777, has produced some of the most most permissive gun laws in the nation. Vermonters are free to carry open or concealed anywhere in the state without a permit. Only the statehouse and schools are exempted. The state Supreme Court upheld the law in 1903.\n\nSuch constitutional protections, combined with Vermont\u2019s best-in-the-nation gun safety record, make gun control a hard sell.\n\nAt a rally last week at the capital, Gun Sense President Ann Braden said guns were \u201cbeing used in domestic relationships to threaten women and children.\u201d Braden claimed the presence of a gun in a domestic violence situation \u201cincreases the likelihood of homicide by 500 percent.\u201d\n\nHowever, according to the most recent FBI data, violent crime has fallen dramatically in Vermont. The violent crime rate fell 19.2 percent in 2013 \u2014 the largest improvement in the nation. Moreover, data from 2010 show that while 42 percent of Vermont households reported having guns, the state\u2019s gun murder rate per 100,000 people was 0.3 percent \u2014 the lowest in the nation.\n\nEd Cutler, president of Gun Owners of Vermont, said crime statistics refute Gun Sense\u2019s arguments for gun control.\n\n\u201cPeople are really pissed off about this bill because it\u2019s getting shoved down their throats. We\u2019ve never had a problem here, and we\u2019ve always behaved ourselves,\u201d Cutler told Vermont Watchdog.\n\n\u201cWe have the highest firearms safety record in the nation. We just came in No. 1 in the FBI crime report, and people don\u2019t like it when somebody comes in here and says you have to do this because something might happen. We\u2019ll, it\u2019s not happening and it hasn\u2019t happened,\u201d he said.\n\nCutler claims Democrat and Republican lawmakers alike are telling his members they don\u2019t support criminal background checks. He said Sears is a case in point.\n\n\u201cWith Sears being the chair of the Judiciary Committee, he knows and understands the situation up here in Vermont. He knows there\u2019s no problem in Vermont, as far as violent crime rate or anything like that,\u201d Cutler said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re hearing everything from \u2018Vermont\u2019s laws are good enough the way they are now\u2019 to \u2018I don\u2019t even want this bill.\u2019 The only people that I can see who are for this bill right now are the three sponsors.\u201d\n\nThose sponsors are Senate President Pro Tem John Campbell, D-Windsor; Senate Majority Leader Philip Baruth, D-Chittenden; and Assistant Senate Majority Leader Claire Ayer, D-Addison. In 2013, Baruth introduced a ban on semi-automatic weapons and high-capacity magazines, but withdrew the bill a week later.\n\nOn Jan. 27, gun owners across the state are planning what they say will be the largest rally in the history of the Vermont Statehouse. A partial list of groups attending the event include the Vermont Federation of Sportsmen\u2019s Clubs, the Vermont Traditions Coalition, Gun Owners of Vermont, Vermont Second Amendment Coalition and the Vermont Citizens Defense League.\n\n\u201cIt will probably be the biggest rally in the history of Vermont. We\u2019re looking at probably a thousand people and maybe more. We\u2019re showing up to demonstrate a show of strength,\u201d Culter said.\n\nIf Vermonters arrive in such numbers, it could be enough to convince undecided lawmakers to side with Sears and Shumlin.\n\nWhile Sears stressed that violent criminals and people with adjudicated mental health problems shouldn\u2019t have guns, he said he doubted the legislature needed to act.\n\n\u201cI would need to be convinced that Vermont has a problem that the law is going to fix. \u2026 Virginia didn\u2019t change their law until the Virginia Tech shooting. It might have prevented that. I don\u2019t know that a background check is going to prevent anything.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Democratic state senator in Vermont says he\u2019s unlikely to support a bill requiring background checks on gun purchases.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "A Democratic state senator in Vermont says he\u2019s unlikely to support a bill requiring background checks on gun purchases.", "title": "Vermont State Senator: Gun Background Checks Unnecessary", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/477909951.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-01-23T22:43:43+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1JuQ4lS"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "A Democratic state senator in Vermont says he\u2019s unlikely to support a bill requiring background checks on gun purchases.", "creator": "@dailysignal", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/477909951.jpg"}, "title": "Vermont State Senator: Gun Background Checks Unnecessary", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Society", "tag": "firearms,society", "published_time": "2015-01-24T03:01:32+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-01-23T22:43:43+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "firearm, gun, background check, Vermont, FBI, Michael Bloomberg, Sandyhook, Virginia Tech"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdfa87\"", "article_summary": "An influential Democratic state senator says he\u2019s unlikely to support a bill requiring background checks on gun purchases because he believes the checks are unnecessary and unconstitutional in Vermont.\nSears, who is chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said background checks don\u2019t pass the common sense test.\nEd Cutler, president of Gun Owners of Vermont, said crime statistics refute Gun Sense\u2019s arguments for gun control.\nBut state background checks might not be constitutional in Vermont, Sears said.\nCutler claims Democrat and Republican lawmakers alike are telling his members they don\u2019t support criminal background checks."}
