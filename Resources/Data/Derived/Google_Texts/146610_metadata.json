Taking aim at the potential nuclear deal with Iran among other targets, Daniels pulled no punches.\n\nAfter praising the United States as a \u201ccounter balance that has cancelled out a lot of tyranny, evil and conquest\u201d and briefly recounting highlights of American courage, Daniels quickly sounded a much darker tone, declaring that \u201cThe courageous politicians that once championed this nation have been replaced, for the most part, by a breed of milksop, politically correct, scared of their own shadow, pushover, pathetic excuses for public servants.\u201d\n\nDaniels directed his first broadside at the Iran deal, accusing Congress of lacking \u201cthe courage to face down an out of control president, even when he makes a deal with the devil.\u201d He then challenged members to ask themselves, \u201cDo I really believe that Iran will not use the money we\u2019re releasing to them to finance terrorists to kill Americans, and, when, not if, but when, the Iranians develop their nuclear device, will they really use it against America and Israel?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t hide from the truthful answer to that question forever,\u201d he added, \u201can answer that will be required of you one day.\u201d\n\nThe country legend then ripped through a litany of complaints about a variety of hot-button political issues, saying \u201cYou [Congress] have allowed Obama to tilt the Supreme Court so far to the left that they\u2019re little more than a shameful extension of the Executive Branch,\u201d presumably referring to recent high-profile Supreme Court rulings in favor of gay marriage and Obamacare.\n\nHe added \u201cYou have allowed cities in this nation to declare themselves sanctuary cities where they protect the worst of the worst criminal aliens, American citizens paying an awful price for your silence.\u201d On July 1st of this summer, an undocumented immigrant shot and killed a young woman in San Francisco, sparking a national debate about \u2018sanctuary cities\u2019 in which local law enforcement defer the enforcement of immigration laws to protect undocumented immigrants.\n\nDaniels also attacked Congress for watching \u201can impossible National Debt balloon completely out of control\u201d and allowing \u201ccorrupt government agencies like the IRS to run over the very people you are sworn to protect.\u201d\n\nFocusing squarely on Congress\u2019 perceived negligence, Daniels argued \u201cYou compose a third of the constitutionally mandated ruling system and you shirk your duty and allow this nation to move a little close to the edge every day.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wish you bunch of sold-out, jaded, burned-out hacks would just go home,\u201d he continued, \u201cand let some people who still have some vision and whose consciences haven\u2019t been seared past the point of reminding them when they\u2019re wrong take over and start to claw this nation back on to the path of sanity.\u201d\n\nSaving his harshest denunciation for last, Daniels closed saying \u201cYou\u2019re no longer men, you\u2019re puppets, you\u2019re caricatures, jokes, a gaggle of fading prostitutes for sale to anybody who can do you a political favor\u201d before adding \u201cPray for our troops and the peace of Jerusalem. God Bless America.\u201d\n\nIn the so-called \u201csummer of anger,\u201d Daniels is hardly alone in his contempt for the political establishment.
