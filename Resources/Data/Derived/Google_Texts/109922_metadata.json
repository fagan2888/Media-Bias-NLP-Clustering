Pre-shutdown wisdom that wasn't\n\nThe shutdown was supposed to be short, if it happened at all.\n\nAfter all, Republicans were sure President Barack Obama would give in at the last minute, like he has in past budget battles. Democrats were equally certain that Republicans would collectively conclude a shutdown wasn\u2019t in their best interests. The assumption of a deal seemed like a good bet.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nBut now Washington\u2019s power players are finding out why they should never assume.\n\n( PHOTOS: 25 great shutdown quotes)\n\nHere\u2019s a look at six pre-shutdown assumptions that have turned out to be flawed, or just plain wrong.\n\n1) The president will negotiate\n\nFor weeks before Tuesday\u2019s shutdown, the president and his aides insisted he wouldn\u2019t negotiate on raising the debt limit or rewriting his signature health law \u2014 a position Republicans ignored in saying they would only keep the government funded if the White House agreed to undermine Obamacare.\n\nThat\u2019s because past experience suggested to Republicans, and some Democrats, that Obama would cave at the end. It\u2019s why Democrats told him to stay out of negotiations before the shutdown and Republicans assumed they could keep driving straight down the middle of the highway without fear of a massive collision. Obama is proving more hidebound than Democrats or Republicans gave him credit for.\n\nNow, Republicans think his intransigence will cost him with the public. If the nation defaults on its credit limit \u2014 or the government remains closed for an extended period of time \u2014 Obama\u2019s non-negotiation stance will make him look unreasonable to Americans, they say.\n\n( WATCH: Jim VandeHei on shutdown state of play before Obama, Boehner meeting)\n\nSo much so that firebrand Sen. Rand Paul was caught on a hot mic this week telling Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell that the GOP should start sounding conciliatory notes to contrast with Obama\u2019s hard line. And House Speaker John Boehner was the first to say after Obama met with congressional leaders at the White House Wednesday that the president \u201cwon\u2019t negotiate,\u201d a repetition of Obama\u2019s line that suggests GOP leaders are happy to help bake it in to the public consciousness.\n\n2) House Republicans are driven by the military and Wall Street\n\nObama spent much of Wednesday messaging to Big Business, meeting with the Financial Services Roundtable and sitting for an interview with CNBC.\n\n\u201cThis time I think Wall Street should be concerned,\u201d he told CNBC\u2019s John Harwood of the fiscal fight. \u201cWhen you have a situation in which a faction is willing to default on U.S. obligations, then we are in trouble.\u201d\n\nThe effort to rally big business against the GOP \u2014 or at least to lean on Republican leaders to cede ground \u2014 mirrors the Democrats\u2019 belief that Republicans would rush not only to fund the government but raise spending so that the Pentagon could avoid planned sequester cuts. But it seems that Obama and some congressional Democrats aren\u2019t terribly familiar with the vein of populism running through the House GOP.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: K Street sidelined in shutdown fight)\n\nIn consecutive elections, the ranks of Republicans whose constituents are wary of big institutions \u2014 like banks and the military \u2014 has grown. Will the threat of a default eventually persuade enough of them to get off the far-right line? Possibly. But it hasn\u2019t yet.\n\n3) Constituents will force a quick resolution\n\nConventional wisdom, and many lawmakers, have always held that a government shutdown would spark outrage among the American public, forcing even the hardest-core Republican lawmakers to abandon their positions when they were deluged with phone calls from angry constituents. Clearly, that hasn\u2019t happened yet.\n\nWashington has created enough sacred cows that keep their funding in a shutdown \u2014 including military pay and Social Security benefits \u2014 to insulate the political class from a shutdown revolt. One GOP lawmaker told POLITICO he\u2019s gotten about a dozen calls so far from residents who are upset about the government closure.\n\n(WATCH: Protesters interrupt GOP presser on Capitol Hill)\n\nA good number of Republican voters are happy about the shutdown, and it gives both sides another opportunity to use the ill effects to suggest the other side doesn\u2019t care about America. Don\u2019t expect the people to pull the politicians out of this mess \u2014 at least not anytime soon.\n\nAnd the majority of the House Republican and Democratic caucuses are so safe from a challenge by the other party that they take more risk \u2014 the danger of a primary \u2014 if they cut a bad deal than if they keep the government closed.\n\nThe executive branch\u2019s quick turnaround on the closure of the National Mall\u2019s World War II Memorial earlier this week demonstrated that particular issues of concern to voters may be resolved quickly, but less provocative matters won\u2019t garner as much attention \u2014 or any rectifying action.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "Washington\u2019s power players are finding out why they should never assume.", "title": "Pre-shutdown wisdom that wasn't", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2013/10/conventional-government-shutdown-wisdom-that-wasnt-97859.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2013/10/04/130410_us_capitol_ap_605.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Congress (2840),Barack Obama (11411),Government Shutdown (526),Debt Ceiling (612)", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "Washington\u2019s power players are finding out why they should never assume.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe11df\"", "article_summary": "Pre-shutdown wisdom that wasn'tThe shutdown was supposed to be short, if it happened at all.\nDemocrats were equally certain that Republicans would collectively conclude a shutdown wasn\u2019t in their best interests.\n( PHOTOS: 25 great shutdown quotes)Here\u2019s a look at six pre-shutdown assumptions that have turned out to be flawed, or just plain wrong.\nBut it seems that Obama and some congressional Democrats aren\u2019t terribly familiar with the vein of populism running through the House GOP.\nAfter all, Republicans were sure President Barack Obama would give in at the last minute, like he has in past budget battles."}
