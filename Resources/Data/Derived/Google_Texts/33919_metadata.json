The president will pay for the plan's premiums himself.\n\nObama's decision to sign up for his signature health care program is entirely symbolic, as the president receives his health care through the military.\n\nObama promised to sign up for coverage under the law in March 2010, after Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) proposed an amendment to the law requiring the president to do so.\n\n\"We think the amendment is unnecessary,\" then-White House spokesman Reid Cherlin said at the time. \"The president will participate in the exchange. But let's be clear: The amendments being offered by Senate Republicans, including this one, are just a ploy to delay the bill.\"\n\nAlso on HuffPost: Most Iconic Photos Of Obama's First Term Most Iconic Photos Of Obama's First Term\n\n1 of 44 Situation Room May 1, 2011: President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden, along with members of the national security team, receive an update on the mission against Osama bin Laden in the Situation Room of the White House, May 1, 2011.
