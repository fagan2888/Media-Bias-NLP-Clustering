Ted Cruz made the first concrete promise of his campaign. \u201c[I]magine in 2017 a new president signing legislation repealing every word of Obamacare,\u201d he said. The next day the Texas senator announced he\u2019d be signing up for Obamacare. \u201cWe\u2019ll be getting new health insurance and we\u2019ll presumably do it through my job with the Senate, and so we\u2019ll be on the federal exchange with millions of others on the federal exchange,\u201d Cruz said.\n\nJamelle Bouie Jamelle Bouie is Slate\u2019s chief political correspondent.\n\nAs you\u2019d expect, this gave the political Internet a good laugh. On Twitter, National Journal\u2019s Ron Fournier had a few jokes\u2014\u201cBreaking: @BarackObama nominates @tedcruz to head the #IRS. Cruz accepts. \u2018Guy\u2019s gotta work.\u2019 \u201d\u2014while liberal websites like Daily Kos crowed over the irony. \u201cTed Cruz becomes the newest Obamacare customer,\u201d read one headline.\n\nConservatives aren\u2019t happy with the schadenfreude, but you can\u2019t blame the reaction. Cruz built his career around hating the Affordable Care Act. It\u2019s funny that just hours after making Obamacare repeal the centerpiece of his campaign, the presidential hopeful is now on the federal exchange with millions of other Americans who need health insurance.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nBut despite his most vocal critics, Cruz slipping on a political banana peel doesn\u2019t make him a hypocrite. For starters, this is a function of circumstances. After Heidi Nelson Cruz, his wife, took leave from her job at Goldman Sachs, the Cruz family lost its health insurance. And under an amendment sponsored by Iowa Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley, Cruz has to use the federal exchange to obtain his health insurance, even though the government will pay the majority of his premiums.\n\nThe other options are to pay for health services \u00e0 la carte, or cover the full cost of COBRA coverage, which\u2014if you\u2019ve ever been in this situation\u2014are expensive options, even for families as wealthy as the Cruzes. Among all the choices, Obamacare is the best one. And then there\u2019s the general principle: \u201cI believe we should follow the text of every law, even laws I disagree with,\u201d Cruz told CNN, following up with a pro forma dig at the president. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the real differences\u2014if you look at President Obama and the lawlessness, if he disagrees with a law he simply refuses to follow it or claims the authority to unilaterally change.\u201d\n\nCruz slipping on a political banana peel doesn\u2019t make him a hypocrite.\n\nThe senator is correct. For the most part, individual behavior is distinct from political belief and institutional preference. A billionaire taking tax breaks isn\u2019t a hypocrite for wanting higher rates and more social services; neither is a climate activist who flies around the world, or a rich liberal who sends his kids to private schools but wants more money for public education.\n\nThere are limits to this idea. It is hypocritical to oppose drugs but indulge for yourself, or, a little differently, to value labor but exploit unpaid work. But for most ideological concerns, the political and the personal are separate spheres that only occasionally overlap. To think otherwise is to fall into the dangerous\u2014if widespread\u2014belief that you can make political change through personal consumption or other atomized actions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s not to say you shouldn\u2019t try to live your political ideals or that your personal beliefs (secular, religious, or otherwise) shouldn\u2019t reflect on your politics. But it\u2019s unreasonable and unfair to expect a one-to-one correspondence, especially on something like health care reform. Cruz can take advantage of Obamacare to get health insurance, and also\u2014as he said\u2014believe that \u201cit is killing millions of jobs in this country and \u2026 has caused millions of people to lose their insurance, to lose their doctors and to face skyrocketing insurance premiums.\u201d He\u2019s wrong, but that\u2019s a separate story.\n\nIf there\u2019s a problem with Cruz and Obamacare, it\u2019s not hypocrisy, it\u2019s empathy. Insurance under the ACA is far from perfect. It\u2019s pricey even with subsidies, and less comprehensive than many employer plans. But the actual comparison isn\u2019t with an ideal, it\u2019s with the pre-reform status quo, in which millions of Americans had either no insurance or junk plans that were worse than useless in an emergency. Against that alternative, Obamacare is a huge improvement. Even now, as health reporter Sarah Kliff writes for Vox, \u201c[I]f Cruz surveyed the market for individual insurance, he\u2019d probably learn pretty quickly that the exchange is almost certainly his best option.\u201d\n\nHaving found himself in the same bad situation as millions of less fortunate Americans, one would hope that Cruz would now see the value of something like Obamacare, which puts a higher floor on material deprivation. Instead, the best odds are for Cruz to take a page from Colorado Sen. Cory Gardner. \u201cIn his successful 2014 campaign for Senate,\u201d writes Bloomberg\u2019s David Weigel, \u201cGardner repeatedly talked about the family plan he\u2019d held onto until it was scrapped for not meeting the ACA\u2019s standards.\u201d Indeed, he turned it into a TV spot. \u201cI got a letter saying that my family\u2019s plan was canceled,\u201d said Gardner in the ad. \u201cThree hundred and thirty-five thousand Coloradans had their plans canceled, too.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.subheadline": "But it doesn\u2019t make him a hypocrite.", "fb-share": "Why Ted Cruz Isn\u2019t a Hypocrite for Signing Up for Obamacare", "sailthru.author": "Jamelle Bouie", "description": "Twenty minutes into his address announcing his run for the White House, Sen.
