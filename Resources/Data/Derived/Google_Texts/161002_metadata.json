The mannequins hold placards telling the story of a homeless person. (Matt McClain/The Washington Post)\n\nThe mannequins \u2014 faceless and made mostly of gray duct tape \u2014 wear worn and baggy clothing, like a homeless person might.\n\nThey have been positioned in office buildings and public spaces across Fairfax County, a deliberate and sometimes off-putting attempt to bring attention to a societal problem that, in this wealthy Northern Virginia suburb, is mostly hidden from public view.\n\n[Finding homes for the homeless in Fairfax County]\n\n\u201cIt freaked me out a little bit,\u201d said Laurie Cunningham, who on Thursday attended a bluegrass concert inside the county government center, where a few of the mannequins had been placed in the audience, including one that resembled a small girl. \u201cAt first, I thought it was a real person.\u201d\n\nEach mannequin bears a placard telling the story of a homeless person in the county \u2014 be it a teenager who aged out of foster care, a military veteran unable to find steady income or a family that sleeps in the woods or a car between trips to school and work.\n\nMannequins propped up at a concert performance at the Fairfax County Government Center attract second looks. (Matt McClain/The Washington Post)\n\nSome advocates for the homeless worry that the county\u2019s campaign could reinforce negative stereotypes or make light of a serious problem. But Fairfax officials say it takes creativity to remind people that roughly 1,200 of the county\u2019s 1.1 million residents do not have a bed to sleep in at night.\n\nThere are people \u201cwho have come up to me and said \u2018They really scare me\u2019 and \u2018I saw a mannequin and walked away,\u2019 \u201d said Dean Klein, who heads the county\u2019s Office to Prevent and End Homelessness.\n\n\u201cInterestingly, that\u2019s the same type of reaction many people have when they see a homeless person. They try to avoid them. They don\u2019t give eye contact, and there\u2019s a level of fear.\u201d\n\n[D.C. region has 11,623 homeless, but that\u2019s not the whole story]\n\nThe 40 mannequins created for the county\u2019s effort have been on display since April inside building lobbies and government offices and at the occasional outdoor festival. The idea was inspired by a similar effort in Cleveland.\n\nThe Fairfax government\u2019s Web site encourages people to post online \u201cselfies\u201d with the mannequins as a way of spreading the word. The placards describing each creation include the hashtag #ItsTimeToEndHomelessness.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s very powerful,\u201d Vince Krevinas, 67, said after noticing one of the mannequins in the county government center. \u201cWhen I first saw it, I didn\u2019t know what it was, but it got my attention.\u201d\n\nThe 40 mannequins created for the county\u2019s effort have been on display since April inside building lobbies and government offices and at the occasional outdoor festival. (Matt McClain/The Washington Post)\n\nA few business groups and nonprofit organizations have paid $200 for the privilege of displaying the dummies in their offices or some other permissible location. The money \u2014 $800 has been collected so far \u2014 will support a county program for homeless veterans.\n\nBut Klein said there are other business groups and some malls that have refused to take them in, worrying that customers would be turned off by the display.\n\n\u201cIt would almost be like they were a live individual,\u201d Klein said.\n\nA mannequin that represents a U.S. military veteran sits inside the Chantilly offices of the Dulles Regional Chamber of Commerce. Staffers there recently took it to a business lunch to prompt a discussion of homelessness.\n\nChamber President Eileen Curtis said her organization sees the campaign as addressing the need for more affordable housing so that those who work in Fairfax can afford to live there, too. \u201cIt\u2019s a moral issue, but it\u2019s also an economic issue,\u201d Curtis said. \u201cHomelessness is everybody\u2019s problem.\u201d\n\n[Fairfax includes some of the nation\u2019s richest Zip codes]\n\nLauri Swift, a membership director for the chamber, sits at a desk that is directly across from the mannequin, which on a recent day was slightly slumped in a chair and holding an American flag.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s distracting, initially,\u201d Swift said, adding that some visitors have told her that it seemed \u201cscary.\u201d\n\nThat fear factor has fueled distaste for the campaign among some advocates for the homeless, who say they worry that it stirs negative feelings about homelessness \u2014 ones that the campaign is trying to erase. None of the advocates wanted to publicly criticize the campaign, however, citing its good intentions and their organizations\u2019 reliance on the county government for funding.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s creating visibility and awareness, which is hard to do in a wealthy county. That\u2019s the first step in addressing solutions,\u201d said Michelle Krocker, director of the Northern Virginia Affordable Housing Alliance.\n\nBut, she added, \u201cThe way to end homeless is through affordable housing,\u201d not mannequins or other gimmicks. \u201cWe\u2019re just not creating enough housing that\u2019s affordable to people who make $20,000 and $30,000 a year.\u201d\n\nFairfax County Supervisor Jeff C. McKay (D-Lee) said he asked for a child mannequin to be placed in the lobby of his Franconia office to highlight the fact that there are about 400 homeless children in the county. \u201cThey\u2019re out there through no fault of their own,\u201d McKay said. \u201cThese are our kids.\u201d\n\nThe mannequin that was delivered resembled a young adult. Its placard describes an 18-year-old who became homeless after leaving foster care. Some constituents have walked into the office, glanced at the figure that sits huddled in a hooded sweatshirt and politely volunteered to wait to be helped, aides to McKay said.\n\nKlein said the campaign will last through the fall. Among the places the county would like to place mannequins next, he said, is busy Reston Town Center, where on a recent afternoon people ate lunch on outdoor cafe patios or lined up in front of an array of food trucks while children danced between columns of water shooting up from a plaza fountain.\n\nClark Peklo, who works nearby and lives in Loudoun County, was spending his lunch break strumming his guitar, his case open for donations. He said he hadn\u2019t heard of the mannequin campaign. And he also hasn\u2019t seen very many homeless people in the area.\n\n\u201cSometimes, you see them crossing the street,\u201d he said. \u201cI think the police pretty much keep them out.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "fairfax county, homeless, reston town center, dulles regional chamber of commerce, jeff mckay", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "The duct-tape mannequins placed in various public areas have evoked mixed reactions in the affluent area.", "title": "Fairfax tries to highlight homeless issues with \u2018scary\u2019 faceless dummies", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/fairfax-mannequin-project-a-reminder-that-some-in-county-are-still-homeless/2015/08/08/67dd8a5a-3c6c-11e5-9c2d-ed991d848c48_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2015/08/06/Local/Images/mannequins0061438903751.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@aolivo"}, "description": "The duct-tape mannequins placed in various public areas have evoked mixed reactions in the affluent area.", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "fairfax county, homeless, reston town center, dulles regional chamber of commerce, jeff mckay", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "eomportal-uuid": "67dd8a5a-3c6c-11e5-9c2d-ed991d848c48"}, "article_summary": "(Matt McClain/The Washington Post)The mannequins \u2014 faceless and made mostly of gray duct tape \u2014 wear worn and baggy clothing, like a homeless person might.\nMannequins propped up at a concert performance at the Fairfax County Government Center attract second looks.\n(Matt McClain/The Washington Post)Some advocates for the homeless worry that the county\u2019s campaign could reinforce negative stereotypes or make light of a serious problem.\n\u201cInterestingly, that\u2019s the same type of reaction many people have when they see a homeless person.\nThe mannequins hold placards telling the story of a homeless person."}
