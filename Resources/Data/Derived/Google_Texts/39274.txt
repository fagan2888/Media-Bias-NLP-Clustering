Native American dancers and pow wow drum groups will convene for the annual Pomona College Powwow: Tradition for Life – Education for the Future Saturday, April 4. The intertribal gathering celebrates Native American culture, and honors traditions through music and dance.

Tongva/Acjachemen spiritual advisor Jimi Castillo will bless the grounds, and MC Bobby Whitebird, of the Cheyenne Nation, will serve as host. The Anahuacalmecac Danzantes Aztecas, Noli High School Bird Singers and the White Rose Singers of Sherman Indian School will also perform at the pow wow.

Northern host drum “Changing Spirits” and southern host drum “The Northridge Boys” will provide special pow wow songs for the dancers throughout the day. A hand drum contest will be held for pow wow drum groups who participate in “roll-call.”

Approximately 20 Native American artisans will showcase traditional and contemporary styles of art, with hand crafted beadwork, pottery, quillwork and silver-smithing available for purchase. Food will be available on-site with the Wildhorse Cafe serving “some of the tastiest Indian Tacos this side of Albuquerque.”

The Pomona College Powwow began in 2011 to honor the ancestors, and tribal homelands on which the college is located. The pow wow is sponsored jointly by the Pomona College Draper Center for Community Partnerships and IndigeNATION Claremont Scholars, a student group of the Claremont Colleges.
