In the second matchup of the longtime conference rivals, the Wildcats raced to a 17-point lead and never looked back in their fourth consecutive win.\n\nL.J. Peak scored 15 points for the Hoyas (15-8, 7-5 Big East), who, with losses this week to Providence and Villanova, are sure to fall out of the Top 25.\n\nThey\u2019ve won eight of nine and have played up to their billing as the preseason Big East favorite.\n\nVillanova upset Georgetown in the 1985 national championship game and wore \u201885 throwback uniforms for a game that featured selected highlights from that \u201cPerfect Game\u201d playing on the big screen.\n\nThe Wildcats made a few more for this season\u2019s reel. Hilliard and Dylan Ennis hit consecutive 3-pointers for a 12-7 lead that sparked the rout.\n\nWith a packed house at the Wells Fargo Center adding to the big-game feel, the Wildcats quickly squashed any thoughts of a Georgetown sweep. Hilliard converted a four-point play early before the 3-point barrage started.\n\nThe Wildcats came in shooting 36 percent from 3-point range and were nailing them with the ease of fastbreak layups. Ennis hit one for a 10-point lead, Ryan Arcidiacono made it 27-13 with his and the Wildcats finished 7 of 13 in the half.\n\nThe Hoyas never got untracked offensively. They missed 7 of 8 3s in the half and received no meaningful production from leading scorers D\u2019Vauntes Smith-Rivera and Joshua Smith. Smith-Rivera was scoreless in the first half and Smith only scored two points on a combined 1 of 6 shooting.\n\nIn the first game, Smith-Rivera scored 17 points for the Hoyas, who pulled away early with a 17-0 run on the way to a 42-20 halftime lead. Georgetown shot 60 percent in the first half and 51 percent for the game.\n\nWith a cold offense, the Hoyas never made a serious attempt at a second-half comeback.\n\nKris Jenkins kept the good times rolling for the Wildcats in the second half. He hit consecutive 3-pointers for a 51-29 lead and made the Wildcats 10 of 18 from 3-point range.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Darrun Hilliard scored 15 points and Josh Hart added 13 to help Villanova avenge its worst game of the season, a 20-point loss on Jan. 19, with a 69-53 win over the Hoyas.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Darrun Hilliard scored 15 points and Josh Hart added 13 to help Villanova avenge its worst game of the season, a 20-point loss on Jan. 19, with a 69-53 win over the Hoyas.", "title": "No. 7 Villanova avenges loss, defeats No. 24 Georgetown", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/feb/7/no-7-villanova-avenges-loss-defeats-no-24-georgeto/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/02/07/georgetown-villanova-basketballjpeg-0bdcc.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/02/07/georgetown-villanova-basketballjpeg-0bdcc.jpg", "description": "Darrun Hilliard scored 15 points and Josh Hart added 13 to help Villanova avenge its worst game of the season, a 20-point loss on Jan. 19, with a 69-53 win over the Hoyas.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "No. 7 Villanova avenges loss, defeats No. 24 Georgetown"}, "Author": "Den Gelston", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Sports, Georgetown, Darrun Hilliard"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd35c8\"", "article_summary": "The Hoyas thumped the Wildcats (21-2, 8-2 Big East) by 20 points in the first game on Jan. 19.\nSmith-Rivera was scoreless in the first half and Smith only scored two points on a combined 1 of 6 shooting.\nIn the first game, Smith-Rivera scored 17 points for the Hoyas, who pulled away early with a 17-0 run on the way to a 42-20 halftime lead.\nVillanova upset Georgetown in the 1985 national championship game and wore \u201885 throwback uniforms for a game that featured selected highlights from that \u201cPerfect Game\u201d playing on the big screen.\nPeak scored 15 points for the Hoyas (15-8, 7-5 Big East), who, with losses this week to Providence and Villanova, are sure to fall out of the Top 25."}
