Wayne\u2019s web site: ROOTforAmerica.com .\n\nWelcome to a sad and tragic Memorial Day.\n\nWhat\u2019s happening at the Veterans Administration should frighten every American to death. It\u2019s like looking into a crystal ball at the future of America\u2019s healthcare system.\n\nLet me ask you a simple question: If I managed a small Dairy Queen and failed miserably, would you promote me to manage a nationwide restaurant chain? What if customers died because of fraud and incompetence under my management? Would any other private sector company hire me to manage a much bigger operation?\n\nWell that\u2019s exactly what\u2019s happening in America right now. The VA is government-run health care. The VA was run so incompetently by government employees that the employees decided to commit fraud to hide their massive failure.\n\nBecause of that criminal decision, veterans died waiting for treatment that never came. Others committed suicide out of desperation and exasperation. Isn\u2019t that called murder?\n\nThe mainstream media is covering up for Barack Obama once again. Journalists should be asking LOUDLY how a government that couldn\u2019t keep up with the health care of our vets, could possibly handle the health care of all 317 million Americans.\n\nIsn\u2019t it \u201cGroundhog Day\u201d if you repeat the same mistakes and expect different outcomes?\n\nSo if we put the same government, and same incompetent government employees, that wrecked the VA in charge of the nation\u2019s health care, why wouldn\u2019t the results be the same? Why won\u2019t the entire health care system collapse? Why wouldn\u2019t there be patient deaths and suicides? Why wouldn\u2019t the cost overruns drive the entire nation into bankruptcy?\n\nIf these are the results on a small scale, why would expanding government-run health care produce any better results on a larger scale?\n\nShouldn\u2019t someone be making that connection? Shouldn\u2019t someone be asking those important questions?\n\nThe VA scandal is the perfect warning sign for what Obamacare will bring to all Americans. The VA scandal is proof positive with government in charge of health care, it will bankrupt the entire country and countless Americans will die through incompetence, neglect, waiting lists and fraud. Our veterans are the canary in the coal mine. We are all headed for disaster.\n\nThe VA scandal is the perfect warning sign for what Obamacare will bring to all Americans. Share:\n\nEven worse, this VA scandal is not new. Conservatives have warned about the dangers of government-run health care for many years, often using the Veterans Administration as Exhibit A.\n\nMy national bestselling book, \u201cThe Ultimate Obama Survival Guide\u201d was released in April 2013. I wrote it six months before that. Almost everything hitting the news about the VA today was already known 18 months ago. Let me quote from my book:\n\n\u201cTake the Veterans Administration. A federal appeals court has ruled the VA suffers from \u2018unchecked incompetence.\u2019 That incompetence is killing our brave veterans. I bet you didn\u2019t know 18 veterans commit suicide per day. Or that 85,000 vets are on waiting lists for care. Even a severely depressed vet can wait eight weeks to see a psychiatrist. Still want government to run your health care?\u201d\n\nSo who couldn\u2019t see this disaster coming? Government mismanagement. Substandard health care. Vets being treated horribly. Vets dying waiting on long waiting lists. Vets committing suicide. We knew all of this long ago. This isn\u2019t new news.\n\nAbout the only thing we didn\u2019t know back then was that there was outright criminal fraud. We didn\u2019t know government employees kept secret waiting lists to cover up the long delays. That\u2019s not negligence or incompetence (the normal results of government employees). That\u2019s government employees handing out death sentences.\n\nWhat a surprise!\n\nConservatives like Sarah Palin and myself screamed about \u201cDeath Panels\u201d and \u201cdeath by rationing\u201d years ago. I predicted in the media long before today\u2019s VA scandal that sick Americans would be committing suicide after dealing with government bureaucrats. I warned grandma might die if the same government that runs the Postal Service and the VA was put in charge of grandma\u2019s cancer surgery.\n\nWe told you so\u2026a long time ago.\n\nGovernment is a walking disaster. Government screws up everything it touches, while losing billions of other people\u2019s money. Government-run gambling (OTB) went broke in New York recently. A government-run brothel went bankrupt in Nevada.\n\nCan you imagine? Government can\u2019t run sex or gambling businesses without screwing it up! How could putting government in charge of health care for 317 million Americans possibly work out?\n\nThe same government employees that brought us $17 trillion in national debt are in charge of health care \u2013 yet Obama promised Obamacare would save money and reduce the deficit. He also promised you could keep your health insurance if you liked it. And you could keep your doctor. And your insurance premiums would not go up.\n\nAs recently as a few weeks ago Obama bragged that 7 million Americans signing up for Obamacare proved it\u2019s a \u201csuccess.\u201d Now we find out about half never paid even their first premium.\n\nHave you ever in the history of the private sector heard of any company where half the customers never paid for the product? Have you ever heard of any private sector CEO in history get away with lies, misrepresentation or fraud on a scale this grand?\n\nDo you now understand what Obama has done to America\u2019s health care system? Forget the threat of losing your insurance, or your doctor, or your prescriptions. Forget the threat of massive premium increases you can\u2019t afford. Or dramatic increases to your co-pay or deductible.\n\nThe real threat with government in charge is losing your life! Either government\u2019s incompetence or criminal behavior will kill you, or after dealing with the idiots that run the government, you\u2019ll just kill yourself.\n\nThis VA scandal is coming to a town near you. Soon. It\u2019s called Obamacare.\n\nWayne Allyn Root is the national bestselling author of \u201cThe Ultimate Obama Survival Guide: How to Survive, Thrive and Prosper During Obamageddon.\u201d Wayne\u2019s Twitter.
