Last week, GPB’s “The Lawmakers” had Senate Majority Leader Bill Cowsert, R-Athens, and state Rep. Stacey Evans, D-Smyrna, to talk about medical care in Georgia.

But the show was stolen by state Sen. Fran Millar, R-Dunwoody, who predicted that, no matter what Republican protests you hear elsewhere, Medicaid expansion under Obamacare will ultimately happen. Look at about the 15-minute mark. Said Millar:

“I can show you a map that shows you, in certain counties, the only people in the medical field are marriage and family therapists. We have a real problem with the number of providers, we have a problem with nurses, throughout this entire state….

“We don’t have sufficient access to many portions of this state. We’ve done some things. We’ve consolidated some hospitals, which makes sense – some of these regional hospitals we put together. Like down there in Statesboro and down in that area.

“But access is a big problem. And I believe we will expand Medicaid. I don’t know when. I think we’re watching some of the other states. It’s being looked at.

“There are plans that are out there, whether it’s Arkansas, whether it’s North Carolina, whether it’s these particular states. But again, we want to do it so we have more control of it. You know, there’s a reason these various states are applying for various waivers. They want controls, too.

“So I think it’s inevitable, to be honest with you. But again, I can’t tell you when.”
