Her son, Rehlin Lee Hoover, died about 30 minutes after being removed from his mother\u2019s womb.\n\nDonna Bryan, Katherine Hoover\u2019s mother, said the deaths devastated her family.\n\nFor the family, devastation merged with frustrated anger in December, when the State Attorney\u2019s Office in Hernando County decided not to pursue charges against DeHayes, as the shooting was deemed accidental.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand,\u201d Bryan said, her voice quivering. \u201cPeople go to jail for DUI. This man killed my daughter and grandson. I feel that my daughter deserves justice. She did nothing to deserve being killed and neither did my grandson.\u201d\n\nDeHayes could not be reached for comment. DeHayes\u2019 family has called the shooting a terrible accident.\n\nIn reaction to the state attorney\u2019s office decision, Bryan sent letters to Gov. Rick Scott and state Attorney General Pam Bondi as well as Brad King, the state attorney in Hernando.\n\nIn a Jan. 13 response, King said that he understands Bryan\u2019s pain, but that an accidental discharge of a firearm that results in a death cannot be prosecuted criminally \u2014 even if the death is a result of gross negligence.\n\n\u201cJust as it is my duty to prosecute those who violate the law, it is equally my duty to refrain from prosecuting those whose conduct, no matter how outrageous, does not constitute a crime,\u201d King wrote. \u201cThis is such a case.\u201d\n\nKing further explained that DeHayes gave a video recorded statement to Hernando sheriff\u2019s investigators in which he described and demonstrated the incident. Besides Carson Hoover, DeHayes\u2019 wife and son also gave statements to investigators, King said.\n\nThose statements show that DeHayes took the gun from its holster, spun it around his forefinger, caught the butt of the gun in his hand and cocked it, then lowered the hammer as the gun fired, King wrote.\n\n\u201cAlthough Mr. DeHayes had put pressure on the trigger to release the hammer, in a virtually identical case from South Florida, the court has held this does not constitute culpable negligence,\u201d King wrote.\n\nIf DeHayes was under the influence of alcohol or drugs \u201cthat would be a factor that would have to be considered,\u201d King said in the letter.\n\nHowever, King added, the deputies who responded to the shooting said that DeHayes did not seem to be \u201cunder the influence\u201d of anything, although he took prescription medication.\n\nDeHayes\u2019 \u201cuse of prescription drugs, in a prescribed amount, is not sufficient to make the matter a crime,\u201d King said.\n\nBryan also is circulating a petition via Change.org that she wants to distribute to elected officials in hopes that criminal charges will be brought against DeHayes.\n\nBryan said this week that she has more than 200 signatures on the petition, although it only has been active a few days. She and husband Gary Bryan are raising her daughter\u2019s 7-year-old son, Nicholas, who lives with them in New Port Richey.\n\nKatherine Hoover called her mother the day she was shot. She had married Carson Hoover about six months earlier, and they had been out shopping for the baby; the couple lived in Inverness.\n\n\u201cShe called, and she\u2019s like, \u2018We just bought the baby\u2019s outfit he\u2019s coming home in, but you\u2019re not going to be happy,\u2019 \u201d Bryan said, adding that she knew what was coming next.\n\n\u201cShe goes, \u2018It\u2019s camouflage!\u2019 I don\u2019t like camouflage, but she really did, and she was all excited. They had baby books in camouflage. The baby\u2019s room was going to be in camouflage.\u201d\n\nBryan\u2019s voice became strained and the following words sounded tortured.\n\n\u201cHer birthday is coming up soon,\u201d Bryan said. \u201cMy grandson (Nicholas) is alive, and I have him in therapy. He\u2019s obviously upset and doesn\u2019t understand why his mommy isn\u2019t here. He asks where his brother is, and I tell him they went to heaven.\n\n\u201cHe says, \u2018Mommy didn\u2019t even say goodbye to me.\u2019 \u201d\n\ngfox@tampatrib.com\n\n(813) 371-1860", "article_metadata": {"taboola-pub-time": "Sun, 15 Feb 2015 01:01:00 -0400", "Description": "NEW PORT RICHEY \u2014 William DeHayes was showing off his gun collection to friends Carson Hoover and his pregnant wife, Katherine, on July 26 when tragedy struck at his Brooksville home.", "og": {"site_name": "TBO.com", "description": "NEW PORT RICHEY \u2014 William DeHayes was showing off his gun collection to friends Carson Hoover and his pregnant wife, Katherine, on July 26 when tragedy struck at his Brooksville home.", "title": "Ruling in Hernando shooting angers victim\u2019s family", "url": "http://www.tbo.com/pasco-county/ruling-in-hernando-shooting-angers-victims-family-20150215/", "image": {"width": 480, "identifier": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20150215/ARTICLE/150219505/AR/0/AR-150219505.jpg", "height": 360}, "updated_time": "2015-02-14T23:56:00Z-04", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "tbo.com", "description": "NEW PORT RICHEY \u2014 William DeHayes was showing off his gun collection to friends Carson Hoover and his pregnant wife, Katherine, on July 26 when tragedy struck at his Brooksville home.", "title": "Ruling in Hernando shooting angers victim\u2019s family", "image": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20150215/ARTICLE/150219505/AR/0/AR-150219505.jpg", "site": "@TBOcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 522234267826834}, "msvalidate.01": "29E67031F86E7FB6DF9823924E21B8B4", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/tbocom", "published_time": "2015-02-15T01:01:00Z-04", "modified_time": "2015-02-14T23:56:00Z-04"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Donna Bryan, Katherine Hoover\u2019s mother, said the deaths devastated her family.\nShe had married Carson Hoover about six months earlier, and they had been out shopping for the baby; the couple lived in Inverness.\nThe bullet killed Katherine Hoover.\nBesides Carson Hoover, DeHayes\u2019 wife and son also gave statements to investigators, King said.\nRick Scott and state Attorney General Pam Bondi as well as Brad King, the state attorney in Hernando."}
