As if Hannity doesn\u2019t stack his own program so far to the right it might topple over one day.\n\nHannity announced in his introduction for the discussion:\n\nNow that Jimmy Fallon has taken over The Tonight Show, will he treat political guests from both sides of the aisle fairly or will the show now become a safe haven for the left?\n\nAs suspicious evidence, Hannity played a clip of Fallon interviewing Michelle Obama about ObamaCare on The Tonight Show last week. Apparently, since Fallon didn\u2019t grill her on \u201cIf you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor\u201d or \u2013 better yet - Benghazi, that was a sign of unconscionable bias.\n\nHannity called Fallon's predecessor, Jay Leno, \u201can equal opportunity joke teller,\u201d adding, \u201cI never sensed any political agenda from him.\u201d Which is Hannity lingo for Leno told enough anti-Democratic jokes to suit him.\n\nHannity\u2019s guest, Dave Berg, a former Tonight Show producer said he thinks it\u2019s too soon to tell if Fallon, as Hannity put it, \u201chas that same ability.\u201d But, Berg said, Fallon seems to have made a choice to be much less political than Leno overall.\n\nBut here\u2019s the thing. I don\u2019t remember any slogan from NBC calling The Tonight Show \u201cfair and balanced\u201d or claiming that The Tonight Show is anything but a variety show with comedy and music. Hannity, on the other hand is a prime time show on a cable news network that does have that slogan.\n\nSo which show\u2019s fairness should we really care about?", "article_metadata": {"csrf-param": "authenticity_token", "google-site-verification": "google51c0b549f514d464.html", "csrf-token": "BYa54KHYC2shG332nWMu2xmZEIwFFfbFnOwuzwH3UVA=", "og": {"url": "http://www.newshounds.us/sean_hannity_worries_jimmy_fallon_not_fair_and_balanced_enough_02262014", "site_name": "NewsHounds", "image": "http://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/newshounds/sites/1/meta_images/original/Newshound3_blue.png?1327001871", "type": "article", "title": "Sean Hannity Worries Jimmy Fallon Not Fair And Balanced Enough"}, "Title": "Sean Hannity Worries Jimmy Fallon Not Fair And Balanced Enough"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce569\"", "article_summary": "Sean Hannity devoted an entire segment of his Hannity show last night to questioning whether or not Jimmy Fallon might tilt The Tonight Show to the left.\nAs suspicious evidence, Hannity played a clip of Fallon interviewing Michelle Obama about ObamaCare on The Tonight Show last week.\nAs if Hannity doesn\u2019t stack his own program so far to the right it might topple over one day.\nHannity, on the other hand is a prime time show on a cable news network that does have that slogan.\nHannity announced in his introduction for the discussion:Now that Jimmy Fallon has taken over The Tonight Show, will he treat political guests from both sides of the aisle fairly or will the show now become a safe haven for the left?"}
