Nine people at an electronic music festival in downtown Dallas were hospitalized over the weekend, most with symptoms of drug and alcohol use.

About three dozen more ill people were treated at the fifth annual Lights All Night’s venue, the Kay Bailey Hutchison Convention Center.

About 40,000 people attended the two-day event, which featured DJs such as Skrillex.

Dallas Fire-Rescue spokesman Jason Evans said four people Friday and five people Saturday were taken to hospitals.

The event had staffed itself with 30 off-duty medics and five special events rescue units, Evans said.

A Lights All Night spokeswoman said the 18-and-over event has a strict policy against drug use.

“The festival, which works closely with local authorities and resources to provide a safe environment, had extremely low arrests and medical incidents,” Alexandra Greenberg said.

Last year, 14 people were hospitalized during the festival and 16 others were treated at the convention center.
