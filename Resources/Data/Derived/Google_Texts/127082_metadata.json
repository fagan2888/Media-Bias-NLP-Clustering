Films like \u201cInglourious Basterds\u201d \u2014 or \u201cThe Dirty Dozen,\u201d another men-on-a-mission romp \u2014 take glee in sticking it to the Nazis, even rewriting history. \u201cThe Monuments Men\u201d will settle for a symbolic eff-you, one the recipient will never detect. That\u2019s as much ambition as the fifth film directed by George Clooney can muster.\n\nActually, that\u2019s not true. In terms of ground covered, it\u2019s downright unwieldy. And it shows in the storytelling. The tale of a platoon of mostly non-fighters \u2014 curators, architects, historians \u2014 shipped into the Eastern front to save Europe\u2019s art treasures doesn\u2019t lend itself well to streamlining. Clooney and usual co-conspirator Grant Heslov try to give it a kicky shape. It starts as a send-up of \u201cOcean\u2019s 11,\u201d with Clooney\u2019s museum director George Stout rounding up the gang. Matt Damon's curator is his Brad Pitt, and wrangled up are such unlikely badasses as John Goodman, Bill Murray and Bob Balaban.\n\nBut historical semi-accuracy necessitates that they split up to cover more ground. Some double up, but the pairings are curiously flat, even when they\u2019re Murray and Balaban. Jaunty music borrowed from every old war movie gives the feeling of a fun lark, but the narrative is too episodic even for an episodic narrative. Set pieces peppered too conservatively over the storyline fail to rise and instead peter out like air out of a whoopee cushion. Even a bit where Damon finds himself stuck on a landmine winds up interrupting the comic momentum for a trite ode to friendship between characters who\u2019ve barely filed any screentime as a unit. The best scene \u2014 a tete-a-tete between Clooney and a German higher-up who refuses to cave even after the war\u2019s ended \u2014 barely belongs in the picture.\n\nIn fact, he does little with the idea of art-heads as war heroes. They mostly find themselves in a generic war film, albeit one with its heart in the right place. Clooney doesn\u2019t find a novel way into the story, even doing precious little with the notion of art-heads as war heroes. It still has a certain charm. As his directorial output proves, he has a yen for the past; most of the kicks in \u201cGood Night, and Good Luck\u201d involved its near-fetishistic recreation of the look of 1950s TV. \u201cThe Monuments Men\u201d is a noble failure on the order of \u201cLeatherheads,\u201d another curiously listless stab at old-school entertainment that remained impossible to hate even as it let you down. Even as this sits there, wheezing to life, it\u2019s hard not to want to give it a hand. A Nick Clooney cameo, of course, only makes it easier.\n\nFollow Matt Prigge on Twitter @mattprigge", "article_metadata": {"description": "Review: 'The Monuments Men' is another noble Clooney-directed failure", "author": "Matt Prigge", "og": {"site_name": "Metro", "description": "Review: 'The Monuments Men' is another noble Clooney-directed failure", "title": "Review: \"The Monuments Men\" is Another Noble Clooney-Directed Failure", "url": "http://www.metro.us/entertainment/review-the-monuments-men-is-another-noble-clooney-directed-failure/tmWnbf---50DUMP34N4qeo/", "image": "http://www.metro.us/_internal/gxml!0/4dntvuhh2yeo4npyb3igdet73odaolf$orxxz8vpybvu7xdkbenqlsbo62wl9p2/WEK_MonumentsMen_0207-614x408.jpeg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "metro.us", "description": "Review: 'The Monuments Men' is another noble Clooney-directed failure", "creator": "Matt Prigge", "image": {"src": "http://www.metro.us/_internal/gxml!0/4dntvuhh2yeo4npyb3igdet73odaolf$orxxz8vpybvu7xdkbenqlsbo62wl9p2/WEK_MonumentsMen_0207-614x408.jpeg"}, "title": "Review: \"The Monuments Men\" is Another Noble Clooney-Directed Failure", "site": "@Metro_US", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msvalidate.01": "9F42CC1BA36D4325E006BBA620C3B678", "robots": "index,follow,noodp,noydir", "mediatype": "Article", "keywords": "Movies,Region National,movies,Bill Murray, Cate Blanchett, George Clooney, Matt Damon, movies, nazis, Rape of Europa, The Monuments Men, WWII", "fb": {"app_id": 1610587402522117, "pages": 146825895340972}, "date": "2014-10-11", "article": {"contentgroup": "Article Automatic,US Legacy Import Automatic", "section": "/entertainment/movies", "published_time": "2014-02-06T12:28:11Z", "modified_time": "2014-02-06T12:28:11Z"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Movies,Region National,movies,Bill Murray, Cate Blanchett, George Clooney, Matt Damon, movies, nazis, Rape of Europa, The Monuments Men, WWII"}, "article_summary": "\u201cThe Monuments Men\u201d will settle for a symbolic eff-you, one the recipient will never detect.\n\u201cThe Monuments Men\u201d is a noble failure on the order of \u201cLeatherheads,\u201d another curiously listless stab at old-school entertainment that remained impossible to hate even as it let you down.\n\"The Monuments Men\" is our kind of action movie: one with Bill Murray and Bob Balaban.\nThat\u2019s as much ambition as the fifth film directed by George Clooney can muster.\nCredit: Claudette Barius'The Monuments Men'Director: George ClooneyStars: George Clooney, Matt DamonRating: PG-132 (out of 5) GlobesOne of the first scenes in the WWII drama \u201cThe Monuments Men\u201d finds a French art historian (Cate Blanchett) spitting in a Champagne glass destined for a German officer."}
