Nuggets guard Ty Lawson did not participate in shootaround and will not play Wednesday night at the Pepsi Center against the Houston Rockets, coach Brian Shaw said.

Lawson continues to be dogged by a sprained left ankle. He’s missed a game with it after suffering the injury late in the fourth quarter against the Memphis Grizzlies last Friday.

Meanwhile, the Nuggets are expected to have the services of forward Darrell Arthur, who has been dealing with a sore knee. It hasn’t caused him to miss any games, but he was held out of practice Tuesday as a precaution.

Also, Wilson Chandler will miss his ninth straight game.

Shaw says he’s encouraging both Lawson and Chandler to return if they can by season’s end.

“I’d still like for them to try and get back to finish the season on the court as opposed to being off the court,” Shaw said. “So I’m encouraging if they can, to try to at least get another game under their belt and finish on that type of note. But if that’s not the case, then so be it.”
