In 2011 and 2012, it boasted the highest percentage of low-income children with a regular physician, at 60 percent. Vermont also had the highest rate of low-income children who had received preventive medical and dental services within the past year, at 79 percent.\n\n\u201cThere are measures where the low-income population in the best performing states \u2014 like Vermont, for example \u2014 is better than the rate for high-income people in other states,\u201d said David Radley, a senior scientist with the Commonwealth Fund and a lead author of the final report on the scorecard.\n\n\u201cIncome and geography certainly matter,\u201d he continued. \u201cBut being low-income doesn\u2019t destine you to getting terrible health care or having terrible health outcomes. We see this type of pattern in states that have made a commitment to low-income populations, where they can rise above the national average for higher income people.\u201d\n\nThe study defines low-income as 200 percent of the federal poverty level or below. For an individual, that is an annual salary below $23,000. For a couple, that is less than about $31,000 a year. For a family of four, that\u2019s less than $47,100 a year.\n\nThe study, which drew from a range of federal reports and data sets, shows that Vermont has the fourth lowest rate in the country of residents who earn less than 200 percent of the poverty level. In Vermont, 31 percent of the population is below that marker.\n\nMeanwhile, many of the states with the highest percentage of their populations earning below 200 percent of the federal poverty level also have the worst health care performance for low-income residents.\n\nPeter Sterling, the director of the Vermont Campaign for Health Care Security, which helps to enroll Vermonters in the state\u2019s public health care programs, said: \u201cIt\u2019s not bad to be low-income in Vermont in terms of getting decent health care when looking at the rest of the country. It doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s good; it just means it\u2019s better than the rest of the country.\u201d\n\nGrading states and Vermont\u2019s relative success\n\nThe scorecard relies on 30 health care indicators across four main categories: access and affordability, prevention and treatment, potentially avoidable hospital use and healthy lives.\n\nVermont has the best track record in the country when it comes to low-income adults with a regular source of care, hospitalized patients who are given information on how to recover, and Medicare beneficiaries who do not receive ambulatory care that they should not.\n\n\u201cVermont stands out so well on these indicators,\u201d Radley said. \u201cThis comes from Vermont\u2019s commitment to insuring people and to getting people primary care through the Blueprint for Health. Vermont clearly has a vision for what it wants its health care system to be.\u201d\n\nVermont\u2019s Blueprint for Health initiative began in 2003 and aims to improve health care results and control health care costs by better coordinating care.

It covers a wide range of services and doesn\u2019t require co-pays or deductibles. Monthly Dr. Dynasaur premiums for families earning up to 200 percent of the federal poverty level range from $0 to $15.\n\nThe state-subsidized Catamount and VHAP insurance programs currently help more than 10,000 Vermonters afford insurance. The programs, however, will end in 2014 when a new phase of the Affordable Care Act takes effect. While the hurdles to enrollment in these programs will disappear, such as being uninsured for a year, the end of these programs could leave many vulnerable Vermonters worse off (story).\n\nMark Larson is commissioner of the Department of Vermont Health Access, which oversees these programs and will manage the state\u2019s new subsidy program.\n\n\u201cI think that the financial help provided by the Affordable Care Act and Vermont starting in 2014 will provide help in paying for premiums to more Vermonters than we\u2019ve ever seen before,\u201d he said. \u201cThat will be a step forward. There will be others who will see changes in their premiums and cost-sharing that will not be consistent with what they experienced in VHAP and Catamount.\u201d\n\nTop in the country, but far from perfect\n\nIn the scorecard category of prevention and treatment, Vermont ranks No. 1.\n\nBut Vermont fares poorly on one of the major indicators of a successful primary care system: The state is 36th in the nation for potentially avoidable emergency department visits among Medicare beneficiaries.\n\n\u201cWe say it\u2019s a measure of emergency use, but these are emergency room visits that could have either been treated or avoided if people were getting enough primary care,\u201d Radley said.\n\nVermont was ranked 49th for 30-day mortality rates for Medicare beneficiaries hospitalized for heart attacks, heart failure and pneumonia. Of those cases, 15 percent died. Radley said the statistical spread between the worst and best rates of 11 percent is too narrow to draw strong conclusions.\n\nTwo other areas where Vermont ranked below average was in obesity levels and dental care. According to the study, 35 percent of Vermonters aged 18 to 64 are obese and 16 percent have lost six or more teeth due to tooth decay, infection or gum disease.\n\nMark Larson said that while Vermont shines in some areas on the scorecard, it also shows where the state could improve.\n\n\u201cWhen it comes to access to health care, we agree it shouldn\u2019t matter where you live or what your income is, and I think the report documents that it is all too often the case that it does matter,\u201d Larson said. \u201cIt does document Vermont has progress to make, which is why it\u2019s important that we move forward with making sure all Vermonters have access to care regardless of income and where they live.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "blueprint for health, department of vermont health access, mark larson, peter sterling, scorecard on state health system performance for low-income populations, vermont campaign for health care security, vermont health care, vermont, vermont news, vermont events, vermont press releases", "og": {"site_name": "VTDigger", "description": "Vermont has the third-best health care in the country for low-income populations, and it\u2019s leading the way in care for low-income children.", "title": "Vermont ranks high in health care for low-income residents  | VTDigger", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Low-Income-Population-Scorecard.jpg", "updated_time": "2013-09-23T21:45:16+00:00", "url": "http://vtdigger.org/2013/09/23/vermont-ranks-high-health-care-low-income-residents/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Vermont has the third-best health care in the country for low-income populations, and it\u2019s leading the way in care for low-income children.", "creator": "@andrewcstein", "image": "http://i0.wp.com/vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Low-Income-Population-Scorecard.jpg?fit=1024%2C688", "title": "Vermont ranks high in health care for low-income residents  | VTDigger", "site": "@vtdigger", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "keywords": "Vermont health care, Commonwealth Fund, Scorecard on State Health System Performance for Low-Income Populations, Blueprint for Health, David Radley, Department of Vermont Health Access, Mark Larson , Vermont Campaign for Health Care Security, Peter Sterling", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/vtdigger", "section": "Health Care", "tag": "Vermont health care", "published_time": "2013-09-23T20:51:18+00:00", "modified_time": "2013-09-23T21:45:16+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe18e8\"", "article_summary": "Vermont clearly has a vision for what it wants its health care system to be.\u201dVermont\u2019s Blueprint for Health initiative began in 2003 and aims to improve health care results and control health care costs by better coordinating care.\nVermont has the third-best health care in the country for low-income populations, and it\u2019s leading the way in care for low-income children.\n\u201cBut being low-income doesn\u2019t destine you to getting terrible health care or having terrible health outcomes.\nPeter Sterling, the director of the Vermont Campaign for Health Care Security, which helps to enroll Vermonters in the state\u2019s public health care programs, said: \u201cIt\u2019s not bad to be low-income in Vermont in terms of getting decent health care when looking at the rest of the country.\nThose are a couple of key findings from the Commonwealth Fund\u2019s first Scorecard on State Health System Performance for Low-Income Populations, released this month."}
