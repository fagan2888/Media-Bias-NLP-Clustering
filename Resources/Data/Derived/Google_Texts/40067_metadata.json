What was agreed and signed in Minsk was a September ceasefire meant to end nearly five months of fighting between Ukrainian soldiers and pro-Russian rebels, during which 2,600 people died.\n\nSince then, the fighting has raged on, intensifying at certain points beyond its pre-ceasefire zenith. Just one month after the ceasefire, a United Nations report placed the death toll at 3,700, including a large number of civilians killed by indiscriminate shelling from both sides. Deadly attacks on public transportation, enforced disappearances, and the increasing presence of Russian soldiers have become regular features in the landscape.\n\nOn Friday, nearly five months after the ceasefire, the United Nations issued a cautiously conservative estimate of 5,000 dead in less than a year of fighting. With enough rote recitation, death tolls simply become muzak in a story like this. But the past few days have placed the crisis on the brink of becoming an all-out war.\n\n\"This has been the most deadly period since the declaration of a ceasefire.\"\n\n\u201cIn just nine days, between 13 and 21 January, at least 262 people were killed due to the hostilities,\" a spokesman for the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights said. \"That is an average of at least 29 people killed per day. This has been the most deadly period since the declaration of a ceasefire on 5 September.\u201d\n\nThis includes two mass-casualty shellings of city buses in Donetsk\u2014Ukraine's fifth-largest city and a major battleground between Ukrainian troops and pro-Russian forces. Earlier this week, the Ukrainian army withdrew from the Donetsk airport after weeks of bitter fighting for control of it. The airport, a sleek and modern point of interest just a year ago, had been reduced to near-rubble as the fighting wore on.", "article_metadata": {"description": "At least 29 people are dying every day in eastern Ukraine and pro-Russian rebels are only promising more violence.", "author": "Adam Chandler", "og": {"site_name": "The Atlantic", "description": "At least 29 people are dying every day in eastern Ukraine and pro-Russian rebels are only promising more violence.", "title": "A Deadly January in Ukraine", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2015/01/ukraine/lead_large.jpg", "url": "http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2015/01/a-deadly-january-in-ukraine/384794/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "theatlantic.com", "site": "@theatlantic", "card": "summary"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "p": {"domain_verify": "68e1a0361a557708fefc992f3309ed70"}, "fb": {"admins": "577048155,17301937", "page_id": 29259828486, "app_id": 100770816677686}, "keywords": "The Atlantic, The Atlantic Magazine, TheAtlantic.com, Atlantic, news, opinion, breaking news, analysis, commentary, business, politics, culture, international, science, technology, national and life", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, width=device-width, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdafc0\"", "article_summary": "What was agreed and signed in Minsk was a September ceasefire meant to end nearly five months of fighting between Ukrainian soldiers and pro-Russian rebels, during which 2,600 people died.\nEarlier this week, the Ukrainian army withdrew from the Donetsk airport after weeks of bitter fighting for control of it.\nDeadly attacks on public transportation, enforced disappearances, and the increasing presence of Russian soldiers have become regular features in the landscape.\nThe airport, a sleek and modern point of interest just a year ago, had been reduced to near-rubble as the fighting wore on.\nOn Friday, nearly five months after the ceasefire, the United Nations issued a cautiously conservative estimate of 5,000 dead in less than a year of fighting."}
