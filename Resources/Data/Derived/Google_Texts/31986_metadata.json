Abraham Lincoln\u2019s native state of Kentucky was the only state that refused to ratify all three amendments. The region of southern Indiana, where Lincoln had lived from the age of seven to twenty-one (1816\u201330), was among the most proslavery and anti-black areas in the free states during those years. Its representative in Congress also voted against the Thirteenth Amendment. So did the congressman from central Illinois, where Lincoln had lived for three decades. Lincoln himself had represented this district in the state legislature for eight years and in the U.S. Congress for one term in the 1830s and 1840s. And in 1842 he married a woman from a prominent Kentucky slaveholding family.\n\nOne might therefore expect that the cultural influences surrounding Lincoln during the first half century of his life would shape his convictions about slavery and race in the same mold that characterized most politicians of his time and place. Instead, he was one of only two representatives in the Illinois legislature who presented a public \u201cprotest\u201d against a resolution passed in 1837 by their colleagues that condemned abolitionist doctrines of freedom and civil equality and affirmed the right of property in slaves as \u201csacred to the slave-holding states.\u201d\n\nLincoln\u2019s protest acknowledged that the Constitution did indeed sanction slavery in those states but declared that nevertheless \u201cthe institution of slavery is founded on both injustice and bad policy.\u201d\n\nIn 1854 Lincoln made an even stronger protest, this time in the form of eloquent speeches against the Kansas-Nebraska Act. Illinois senator Stephen A. Douglas, Lincoln\u2019s longtime political rival, had rammed this law through a divided Congress. It repealed the earlier ban on the expansion of slavery into territories carved out of the Louisiana Purchase north of latitude 36\u00b0 30\u2032. Douglas\u2019s actions opened these territories to slavery and sparked the formation of the new \u201canti-Nebraska\u201d Republican Party, which would nominate Lincoln for president six years later. Douglas had said that if the white people who moved to Kansas wanted slavery there, they should be allowed to have it. \u201cThis declared indifference, but as I must think, covert real zeal for the spread of slavery, I can not but hate,\u201d said Lincoln in 1854, \u201cbecause of the monstrous injustice of slavery itself\u201d and also \u201cbecause it deprives our republican example of its just influence in the world\u2014enables the enemies of free institutions, with plausibility, to taunt us as hypocrites.\u201d\n\nWhen he ran for the Senate in the famous contest against Douglas in 1858, Lincoln declared: \u201cI have always hated slavery I think as much as any Abolitionist.\u201d Six years later he said, with feeling: \u201cIf slavery is not wrong, nothing is wrong. I can not remember when I did not so think, and feel.\u201d As Eric Foner makes clear in \u201cThe Fiery Trial: Abraham Lincoln and American Slavery,\u201d however, Lincoln was antislavery but not an abolitionist. That is, he considered slavery a violation of the natural rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness enunciated in America\u2019s founding charter (written by an antislavery slaveowner).\n\nLike Thomas Jefferson, Lincoln expected slavery eventually to die out in America. Preventing its spread into the territories was the first step, said Lincoln in 1858, toward putting it \u201cin course of ultimate extinction.\u201d But unlike the abolitionists, Lincoln and most Republicans in the 1850s did not call for the immediate abolition of slavery and the granting of equal citizenship to freed slaves.\n\nHaving grown up in Kentucky and the border regions of Indiana and Illinois, Lincoln also felt a degree of empathy with the South that was not shared by abolitionists of Yankee heritage. Although he hated slavery, he did not hate slaveowners. \u201cI think I have no prejudice against the Southern people,\u201d he said at Peoria, Illinois, in 1854. \u201cWhen Southern people tell us they are no more responsible for the origin of slavery, than we; I acknowledge the fact.\u201d Lincoln also said he could \u201cunderstand and appreciate\u201d how \u201cvery difficult\u201d it would be \u201cto get rid of\u201d slavery \u201cin any satisfactory way. . . . If all earthly power were given me, I should not know what to do\u201d about the institution where it then existed.\n\n\u201cMy first impulse would be to free all the slaves, and send them to Liberia. But a moment\u2019s reflection would convince me\u201d that even if such a project was feasible in the long run, \u201cits sudden execution\u201d was impossible. \u201cWhat then? Free them all, and keep them among us as underlings? Is it quite certain that this betters their condition?\u201d\n\nWhat about the abolitionist proposal to \u201cfree them and make them politically and socially our equals?\u201d Lincoln confessed that \u201cmy own feelings will not admit of this; and if mine would, we well know that those of the great mass of white people will not. Whether this feeling accords with justice and sound judgment, is not the sole question. . . . A universal feeling, whether well or ill-founded, can not be safely disregarded.\u201d The abolitionist program of immediate freedom was therefore unrealistic. \u201cIt does seem to me that systems of gradual emancipation might be adopted; but for their tardiness in this, I will not undertake to judge our brethren of the south.\u201d Lincoln could not \u201cblame them for not doing what I should not know how to do myself.\u201d\n\nProslavery Southern whites did not reciprocate Lincoln\u2019s expressions of empathy. To many of them, especially the radical disunionists known as fire-eaters, the divergence between \u201cantislavery\u201d and \u201cabolitionist\u201d was a distinction without a difference. In their view, anyone who considered slavery a monstrous injustice and spoke of placing it in the course of ultimate extinction was as dangerous as those who demanded its immediate extinction. When the \u201cBlack Republican\u201d Lincoln was elected president in 1860, they led their states out of the Union to prevent the feared extinction of their \u201cpeculiar institution.\u201d This preemptive action put in train a course of events that by 1864 brought about precisely what they feared.\n\nBy that time the nation was facing, as imminent realities, the same alternatives Lincoln had outlined as abstract possibilities in his famous Peoria speech ten years earlier: 1) free all the slaves and send them to Liberia (or elsewhere); 2) free them and keep them as \u201cunderlings\u201d in the United States; or 3) free them and make them the political and social equals of white people (civil equality, in modern terms). In 1864 Lincoln had a much more definite idea of \u201cwhat to do\u201d and a great deal more \u201cearthly power\u201d to do it than in 1854. His \u201cbrethren of the south\u201d were now \u201crebels\u201d whose war against the United States had given him that power as commander in chief of an army of a million men, one hundred thousand of them the former slaves of those rebels.\n\nLincoln had tried a version of the first alternative (free slaves and send them abroad), but few wanted to go, and now that they were fighting so \u201cgallantly in our ranks\u201d their commander in chief no longer wanted them to go. By 1864 Lincoln therefore rejected that alternative and was looking beyond the second one of freeing them only to \u201ckeep them among us as underlings.\u201d In 1862 the president had proposed gradual emancipation during which most black people would indeed have remained as underlings for an indefinite period. But he was now moving toward a belief in immediate abolition and equal rights for all citizens. According to Foner, Lincoln \u201cbegan during the last two years of the war to imagine an interracial future for the United States.\u201d\n\nWhen he was sworn in for his second term on March 4, 1865, writes Foner, \u201cfor the first time in American history companies of black soldiers marched in the inaugural parade. According to one estimate, half the audience that heard Lincoln\u2019s address was black, as were many of the visitors who paid their respects at the White House reception that day.\u201d For \u201cLincoln opened the White House to black guests as no president had before.\u201d\n\nThe central theme of \u201cThe Fiery Trial\u201d is Lincoln\u2019s \u201ccapacity for growth\u201d in his \u201cviews and policies regarding slavery and race.\u201d Foner does not doubt the sincerity of his statement in 1858 that he had \u201calways hated slavery.\u201d By the time of Lincoln\u2019s death, however, \u201che occupied a very different position with regard to slavery and the place of blacks in American society than earlier in his life.\u201d In 1837 Lincoln described slavery as an injustice; by 1854 it was a monstrous injustice; in 1862 he told a delegation of five black men he had invited to the White House that \u201cyour race are suffering in my judgment the greatest wrong inflicted on any people.\u201d This was good abolitionist rhetoric. But Lincoln\u2019s purpose at this meeting in 1862 was to publicize his program for government assistance to blacks who volunteered to emigrate.\n\nLike his political heroes Thomas Jefferson and Henry Clay, Lincoln could not yet in 1862 imagine a future of interracial equity in the United States. \u201cEven when you cease to be slaves,\u201d he told the five delegates, \u201cyou are yet far removed from being placed on an equality with the white race.\u201d Moreover, \u201cthere is an unwillingness on the part of our people, harsh as it may be, for you free colored people to remain with us. . . . I do not propose to discuss this, but to present it as a fact with which we have to deal. I cannot alter it if I would. . . . It is better for us both, therefore, to be separated.\u201d\n\nDespite overtones of empathy with the plight of blacks in a racist society, the condescension shown by these presidential remarks provoked widespread condemnation by abolitionists both black and white.\n\n\u201cPray tell us, is our right to a home in this country less than your own?\u201d wrote one black man to the president. \u201cAre you an American? So are we.\u201d Few blacks offered to emigrate, and a pilot project supported by the Lincoln administration to colonize several hundred black volunteers on a Haitian island was a failure. A good many Republicans agreed with one of their number who branded Lincoln\u2019s \u201cscheme\u201d of colonization as \u201csimply absurd\u201d and \u201cdisgraceful to the administration.\u201d\n\nLincoln also came to see the \u201cscheme\u201d of colonization as unjust and impractical, though perhaps not disgraceful to his administration. As Foner points out, after the president issued the Emancipation Proclamation and committed the government to the recruitment of black soldiers, Lincoln \u201cabandoned the idea of colonization.\u201d He could scarcely ask black men to fight for their country and then tell them that they should leave it. \u201cBlack soldiers played a crucial role not only in winning the Civil War but also in defining its consequences,\u201d writes Foner, by putting \u201cthe question of postwar rights squarely on the national agenda.\u201d Because of Lincoln\u2019s admiration for the courage of black soldiers and their contribution to Union victories, his \u201cracial views seemed to change\u201d and his \u201csense of blacks\u2019 relationship to the nation also began to change.\u201d Their military service \u201cimplied a very different vision of their future place in American society than plans for settling them overseas.\u201d\n\nFoner is right on the mark here. Indeed, perhaps he could have emphasized even more the timing as well as the importance of Lincoln\u2019s praise for black soldiers. In August 1863 the president wrote one of his forceful public letters that served a purpose similar to a modern president\u2019s prime-time televised speech or news conference. This letter appeared in print just one year after Lincoln\u2019s colonization speech to blacks in the White House, and a month after white antidraft rioters in New York City lynched black men at almost the same moment black soldiers were dying in the attack on Fort Wagner in South Carolina (dramatized in the movie \u201cGlory\u201d). Figuratively looking those draft rioters in the eye, Lincoln declared: \u201cYou say you will not fight to free negroes. Some of them seem willing to fight for you.\u201d When the war was won, Lincoln continued, \u201cthere will be some black men who can remember that, with silent tongue, and clenched teeth, and steady eye, and well-poised bayonet, they have helped mankind on to this great consummation; while, I fear, there will be some white ones, unable to forget that, with malignant heart, and deceitful speech, they have strove to hinder it.\u201d\n\nA year later that \u201cgreat consummation\u201d seemed more distant than ever, as military stalemates on all fronts after enormous casualties that summer caused Northern morale to plummet to its lowest point yet. Lincoln came under intense pressure to retreat from the abolition of slavery as one of his publicly stated prior conditions for negotiations to end the war. He refused. To back away from the promise of freedom would be an egregious breach of faith, declared Lincoln. \u201cCould such treachery by any possibility, escape the curses of Heaven?\u201d More than a hundred thousand black soldiers were then fighting for the Union.\n\nLincoln expressed contempt for those who \u201chave proposed to me to return to slavery [these] black warriors.I should be damned in time & in eternity for so doing. The world shall know that I will keep my faith to friends & enemies, come what will. . . . Why should they give their lives for us, with full notice of our purpose to betray them?\u201d\n\nWhat Lincoln and everyone else believed would come of this principled stand was his defeat for reelection in 1864. Two years after he had told African Americans that they should leave the country for the good of both races, he now staked his career and reputation on defending the freedom they had earned by fighting for their country. Northern battlefield victories in the fall of 1864 turned around both the military and political situations by 180 degrees. Instead of being \u201cbadly beaten\u201d at the polls in November, as he had expected in August, Lincoln was decisively reelected. He then invoked his mandate and threw all of the resources of his administration into a successful fight to get the Thirteenth Amendment through Congress.\n\nTwo days after Confederate general Robert E. Lee surrendered his army at Appomattox, Lincoln gave a speech to an interracial crowd on the White House lawn. In this address he looked toward the future problem of reconstructing the war-torn South. At a time when black men could not vote even in most Northern states, the president expressed his preference for enfranchising literate blacks and all black Union military veterans in the new South. \u201cThis was a remarkable statement,\u201d Foner rightly asserts. \u201cNo American president had publicly endorsed even limited black suffrage.\u201d\n\nLincoln\u2019s secretary of the interior considered this endorsement a critical step toward full and equal citizenship for all blacks. So did John Wilkes Booth, who was in the crowd that heard Lincoln\u2019s words on April 11. \u201cThat means n***r citizenship,\u201d uttered Booth. \u201cNow, by God, I\u2019ll put him through. That is the last speech he will ever make.\u201d\n\nThree days later Booth fulfilled his dark oath. Lincoln did not get the chance to continue the trajectory that had propelled him from the gradualist and colonizationist limitations of his antislavery convictions in earlier years toward the immediatist and egalitarian policies he was approaching by 1865. \u201cLincoln had changed enormously during the Civil War,\u201d Foner concludes. Most strikingly, \u201che had developed a deep sense of compassion for the slaves he had helped to liberate, and a concern for their fate.\u201d\n\nThe nation\u2019s foremost black leader, Frederick Douglass, recognized this compassion in a memorial address he delivered in 1865. Lincoln was \u201cemphatically, the black man\u2019s president,\u201d said Douglass, \u201cthe first to show any respect for their rights as men.\u201d A decade later, however, in a speech at the dedication of an emancipation monument in Washington, Douglass described Lincoln as \u201cpreeminently the white man\u2019s President.\u201d To his largely white audience on this occasion, Douglass declared that \u201cyou are the children of Abraham Lincoln. We are at best only his step-children.\u201d Later in the same speech, Douglass brought together his Hegelian thesis and antithesis in a final synthesis.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The president walked a careful line, sometimes imperfectly.
