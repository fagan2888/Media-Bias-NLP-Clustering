Q&A: Brill on 'Gluttonous Profits' and 'the Ultimate ACO'

Author Steven Brill offers an approach to bending the healthcare cost curve that follows none of the usual policy paths.

In his new book, lawyer, journalist and media entrepreneur Steven Brill says he can give hospital administrators "the sweats" by challenging them about "gluttonous profits and salaries."

America's Bitter Pill: Money, Politics, Backroom Deals and the Fight to Fix Our Broken Health Systemfocuses on the debate over the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. But the book returns to Brill's indictment of high hospitals costs that filled an entire issue Time magazine in 2013.

He calls for a system of "fully integrated provider-insurer company players that would function as regulated oligopolies or heavily regulated monopolies" with a cap on "operating profits." The system would also include salary caps for administrators and a requirement that a hospital chief executive be a practicing physician.

Finally, the systems would have to insure a percentage of the market's Medicaid patients and offer in-house ombudsmen to handle complaints from both patients and providers. Brill spoke to HLM about his book last week. The transcript has been edited for clarity.

HLM: Can you talk about how your system of health care oligopolies would work?

Brill: There are two stages. If the system is an oligopoly, it still gets regulated heavilyâ€¦ But if it becomes a monopoly such as Yale-New Haven, for example, the regulations would be more stringent, where you are really looking at how fair the prices are and digging more deeply into their business. Or you can say you have to divest and let the Cleveland Clinic come in and compete with you.
