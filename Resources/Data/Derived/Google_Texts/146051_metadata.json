Wonderful. This proto-industrial grinding process \u2014 opening and closing the sails on the windmill to control speed and consistency \u2014 results in super fine flour. The chaff is shaken out by hand (to be fed to Yannis\u2019s chickens, free-ranging nearby) and the flour is immediately taken to a small bakery a few minutes away, where Theologia, who shut the family bakery for two years after her husband died, is now producing the healthiest bread in the world.\n\nThe healthiest bread. From heirloom wheat. Right here on Patmos, where goats still have the right of way. One euro, ten cents. About $1.20. Delicious!\n\nAnd here\u2019s why I\u2019m telling you all this: In the U.S., we\u2019re about as far from eating the healthiest bread in the world as you can get. In fact, the modern dwarf wheat flour that is in our daily bread, and hidden in everything from soups to lipstick to vodka is making millions of Americans sick. Very, very sick, according to family physician Mark Hyman, who is relentless on this subject.\n\n\u201cThis new modern wheat may look like wheat,\u201d he reports, but in fact, it\u2019s \u201cthe product of genetic manipulation and hybridization that created short, stubby, hardy, high-yielding wheat plants with much higher amounts of starch and gluten and many more chromosomes coding for all sorts of new odd proteins.\u201d\n\nSo what? Bread is still the staff of life, right? Wrong. It\u2019s the stuff of early death, he says, and each American consumes about 55 pounds of this tainted wheat flour every year.\n\n\u201cThe first major difference of this dwarf wheat is that it contains very high levels of a super starch called amylopectin A,\u201d Dr. Mark explains. Amylopectin A is very good for making Wonder Bread fluffy and Cinnabons sticky, but it is super fattening for humans.\n\nBoth white and whole-grain bread are high on the glycemic index: \u201cWe know that foods with a high glycemic index make people store belly fat, trigger hidden fires of inflammation in the body and give you a fatty liver leading the whole cascade of obesity, pre-diabetes and diabetes.\u201d\n\nOur modern commercial wheat is also engineered to be super-addictive, Hyman explains, making us crave and eat more than we otherwise would.\n\n\u201cNot only does this \u2018FrankenWheat\u2019 contain super starch, it also contains super gluten, which is more likely to create inflammation in the body,\u201d also leading to obesity, diabetes and lots of other chronic diseases.\u201dThese non-communicable chronic diseases will cost our global economy $47 trillion over the next 20 years.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s a lot of dough. \u201cThe biggest scam perpetuated on the unsuspecting public is the inclusion of \u2018whole grains\u2019 in many processed foods full of sugar and wheat giving the food a virtuous glow,\u201d he says.\n\nThe bread in Patmos with the windmill stamp on the crust has earned its virtuous glow.\n\nIt\u2019s the heirloom, Biblical wheat of our ancestors, something, sadly, most Americans never get to eat. I plan to tear off a chunk right now, pour some of Bo\u2019s luscious local olive oil on top, and chew over how it is that Big Food\u2019s appetite for re-engineering wheat turned our U.S. bread supply to toast.\n\nMarilynn Preston is a fitness expert, personal trainer and speaker on healthy lifestyle issues.
