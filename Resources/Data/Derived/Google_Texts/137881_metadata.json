Abroad, McDonald's also offers delivery in some countries, including the Philippines, China, Singapore and India.\n\nWhile delivery could exacerbate operational difficulty at the Golden Arches, Easterbrook has signaled he is willing to tackle the tough problems, including testing all-day breakfast in the San Diego area\u2014something the chain has repeatedly said was too difficult in the past.\n\nBefore taking the helm, Easterbook addressed potential delivery at the chain in a December interview at the AKTA Innovation Series, saying there are \"loads of reasons\" why McDonald's doesn't offer delivery in the U.S. and while none of them are wrong, the chain could be more innovative in that arena.\n\n\"Frankly if we can't solve something like that with the resources we have \u2026, then that's a failure on our side. So I mean that's where you just want to unlock the curiosity of our own minds and just be bolder, more innovative, take some risk. It's not that big of a risk and have some fun,\" he said.\n\nRelated: 35 Astounding Facts About McDonald\u2019s\n\nThe chain had previously filed for a trademark for \"McDelivery\" in 1993 before the trademark was cancelled in 2002. In 1993, it began testing delivery in some Virginia restaurants, the New York Times reported at the time.\n\nEarly on Wednesday, McDonald's met Wall Street's revenue estimates but delivered worst-than-expected earnings and comparable restaurant sales globally and in the United States.\n\nThis article originally appeared on CNBC.\n\nRead more from CNBC:\n\nGoogle Fiber: Super fast Internet coming to more cities\n\nNearly a third of savers have less that $1,000 for retirement\n\nThe 4 percent rule no longer applies for most retirees\n\n", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "While\u00a0McDonald's\u00a0investo", "title": "Is McDonald\u2019s Planning a McDelivery Service?", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/04/22/McDonald-s-Planning-McDelivery-Service", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/cbusiness-us-mcdonalds-antibiotics-mcnuggets-insight_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/04/22/McDonald-s-Planning-McDelivery-Service", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/cbusiness-us-mcdonalds-antibiotics-mcnuggets-insight_1.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "While\u00a0McDonald's\u00a0investo", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Some New York City locations already offer delivery through Seamless, a third-party delivery service.\nIn 1993, it began testing delivery in some Virginia restaurants, the New York Times reported at the time.\nWhile McDonald's investors will have to wait until May 4 to get a full picture of the chain's turnaround plan, a recent trademark application reveals what could be up the fast food giant's sleeve.\nAbroad, McDonald's also offers delivery in some countries, including the Philippines, China, Singapore and India.\nRelated: 35 Astounding Facts About McDonald\u2019sThe chain had previously filed for a trademark for \"McDelivery\" in 1993 before the trademark was cancelled in 2002."}
