Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee is firing back at President Obama for his Federal Communications Commission (FCC) led internet takeover\u2013which the administration bills as \u201cnet neutrality\u201d and critics call \u201cnet neutering\u201d\u2013saying it can lead to censorship. Still Democrats are backing the President, saying his policies mean equal access for all.\n\nThe FCC responded to President Obama\u2019s push for Net-Neutrality to regulate the internet with a 3-2 vote over objections from some Republicans. According to Blackburn\u2019s office, the courts have previously rejected the FCC\u2019s attempts to regulate the internet.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nNet neutrality supporters say the regulations will increase investment in internet based services. The rules prohibit broadband providers from blocking or regulating internet traffic in a selective manner.\n\nAccording to the Tennessee Republican, there is no need for the FCC to be preceding internet service providers because the internet has worked effectively for decades.\n\n\u201cThe internet is not broken, it does not need the intervention of the FCC,\u201d Blackburn said.\n\n\u201cWhat this in essence does is to give the federal government the right to determine priority and value to content \u2013 so they\u2019re ultimately going to be able to censor everything that you have.\u201d Blackburn added. \u201cWe don\u2019t need this. It will run up costs and lead to new regulations and new taxes,\u201d\n\nBut Democratic Representatives Chris Van Hollen (D-MD) and Adam Schiff (D-CA) disagree with Blackburn.\n\nVan Hollen said he supports President Obama\u2019s objectives for an open internet.\n\n\u201cAs the interest develops, if the President doesn\u2019t adopt the policies he has proposed, you would actually slow down easy access to all content on the internet,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIn fact what the president wants to do is make sure that we do not move into a system where people who pay more get faster easier access to content \u2013 we want to make sure we have content neutrality here and net neutrality,\u201d Van Hollen added.\n\nSchiff also said he is a strong supporter of what President Obama is doing.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a strong supporter of net neutrality \u2013 I think it would be a real set back economically for us if we have a situation for us where the ISPs can create fast and slow lanes,\u201d said Schiff.\n\nSchiff said he wants to keep the free market on the internet in place.\n\nBlackburn is continuing her push to stop the Obama Administration\u2019s efforts to regulate the Internet through Net Neutrality regulations. She reintroduced her Internet Freedom Act on March 3, 2015, which would halt the FCC\u2019s Net-Neutrality rules.\n\nOn March 12, 2015, the FCC released its order publically.\n\n\u201cI reiterate my disappointment in the lack of transparency that accompanied this process,\u201d read Blackburn\u2019s response to the order.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Rep.
