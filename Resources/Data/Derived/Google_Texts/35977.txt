Key run

After Dwayne Benjamin’s 3-pointer tied it at 52 with 5:54 remaining, Wisconsin outscored the Ducks 10-2 over the next 4:51 to lead 62-54 with 1:03 left. Oregon got no closer than six the rest of the way.

Unsung star

Wisconsin’s Zak Showalter averages just 7.5 minutes and 2.0 points per game. The 6-foot-2 sophomore on Sunday contributed five points, five rebounds and two assists in 15 minutes. With the Badgers up three, he hit a 3-pointer and a reverse layup midway through the second half to push the lead to eight.

Stat-sheet stuffer

Nigel Hayes of Wisconsin does a little bit of everything well. The 6-8 sophomore had 14 points, five rebounds, three assists, a block and a steal on Sunday.

High riser

Oregon freshman Dillon Brooks took it to a higher floor than the Badgers expected, launching himself along the left baseline and throwing down a one-handed jam with 12:28 left in the first half.

Could have gone either way

The memory of Wisconsin’s 2014-15 season. Sam Dekker and Frank Kaminsky played like the veterans they are down the stretch, providing the clutch plays needed to survive and advance.

What was that?

A female fan from Wisconsin didn’t appreciate the officials calling a foul on Josh Gasser in the first half. The foul was changed to Zak Showalter. “Go look at the film, you idiot!” she yelled.

Our take

Rarely does any team steamroll four opponents to reach a Final Four. Wisconsin was vulnerable to an upset on Sunday, lacking the dominance it’s displayed during long stretches of the Big Ten season. But the Badgers came through when it mattered and will head to Los Angeles confident they can reach Indianapolis.

“Lot of friends and family. I love Omaha. Omaha’s a great city. It was really good, really enjoyed being here. Just wish we could have won.” — former University of Nebraska at Omaha player and assistant coach Tony Stubblefield, now an Oregon assistant, on returning to his old stomping grounds.
