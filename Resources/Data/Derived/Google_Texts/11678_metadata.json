In the coming months, when voters head to the polls in November, they'll see two initiatives on the ballot for education.\n\nCompeting amendments will be on the ballot this year as you head to the polls in November. Those amendment initiatives sparked, following much debate over whether or not the legislature should fully fund education. Initiative 41 has been proposed by the public, while initiative 42a has been proposed by the legislature, as the law states when the citizens put forth a ballot initiative, the legislative has the right to do a competing amendment.\n\n\"For the first time ever in the 200 year history in Mississippi, the legislature gave a competing amendment,\" Secretary of State Delbert Hosemann said. \"So, we have 42 and 42-A and both of those will be on the ballot.\"\n\nInitiative 42 adds that the legislature must fund education and also that if it isn't funded that the chancery judge can order it to be funded. While Initiative 42-A indicates that you have to have an effective way of funding education.\n\n\"These two competing amendments are close, but they have little differences between them; the chancery court provisions and fully funding MAEP is not in there, but fully funding education is in there,\" Hosemann said. \"So, the citizens will be discussing that.\"\n\nHistorically speaking, Hosemann says there have been 41 initiatives, but only 4 have been put on the ballots, of those four two were passed. So there is a 50 percent success rate of Initiatives. Those initiatives were term limits which was defeated, imminent domain which was passed, voter id which passed, and the most recent personhood which was defeated. When voters head to the polls in November, Hosemann says there is something you should know.\n\n\"You will have to select whether you want to amend the constitution or not,\" said Hosemann. \"We have right now in the constitution it says, that the legislature has to fund education. It's in there, but it's not as specific as these other two are. The first question Mississippi voters will have is to decide that. Then the second question will be which one do you want, 42 or 42-A.\"\n\nDepending on the outcome of either initiative, Hosemann says there is a set date for the proposed new amendments to go into effect.\n\n\"This will be part of the Mississippi Constitution within 30 days of when the election is certified, which usually takes 10 days,\" said Hosemann. \"So, along about December the 15th or so, if they adopt this constitution amendment it will be in the constitution and the legislature will be required to follow it, not follow it five years for now, it will be ready to go right then.\"\n\nThe secretary of state is hosting a series of public hearings to give Mississippian's the opportunity to express their opinions regarding these initiatives. They will be decided in the November 3rd General Election. The next public hearing will be held on August 27 at 5 that evening.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"medium": "video", "description": "Mississippi voters will decide on Initiative 42 or Initiative 42-A at the polls on November 3", "language": "english", "author": "Aaron Morrison", "og": {"description": "Mississippi voters will decide on Initiative 42 or Initiative 42-A at the polls on November 3", "title": "Initiative 42 VS.
