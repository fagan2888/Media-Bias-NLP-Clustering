From Imran Jattala of the Examiner:

The USCIRF Chairman in his testimony before the commission highlighted the plight of Ahamdis due to the infamous blasphemy and anti-Ahmadi laws in Pakistan and specially underscored the case of two Ahmadi Muslim prisoners in Saudi Arabia.

Dr. George said the Saudi government continues to prosecute, convict, and imprison individuals charged with crimes such as apostasy, blasphemy, and sorcery.

Speaking specifically about the two men who were arrested in May 2012 by the Saudi government for apostasy when they joined the Ahmadiyya Muslim community, Dr. George said all information about the prisoners is being withheld by the Saudi government.

Dr. George called on the Saudi government “to release these men who are guilty of no crime other than to exercise their right as human beings to religious freedom.”

Dr. George further demanded that the US government “press the Saudi government for the release of these Ahmadi prisoners and to cease and desist the harassment of this and other minorities.
