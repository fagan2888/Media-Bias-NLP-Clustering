Speaking to The Associated Press, attorney John Gomez said the incident took place only a few weeks after the boy brought home his new pet rat. \"He was a bright, energetic, friendly, happy kid who actually had a prior rat, who was a female, and he had this idea in his young head of having his female rat get married,\" he told reporters.\n\nAiden\u2019s parents, Andrew Pankey and Vanessa Sauer, brought their son to the emergency room on the night of June 11, 2013. According to court documents, he reported a severe stomach ache and high fever. He died within 24 hours of admission.\n\nThe San Diego County medical examiner\u2019s office later determined that the cause of death was streptobacillus moniliformis infection, or rat-bite fever. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the infection is usually contracted from bites and scratches from rodents, and must be treated with antibiotics. The agency is currently reviewing lab samples from Aiden\u2019s rat to confirm it carried the disease at the time of the incident.\n\nPetco, whose care sheet states that pregnant women and young children \u201cshould consider not having a rat as a pet,\u201d told reporters that the company is in the process of investigating the charges of the lawsuit. That said, it is devastated by the family\u2019s tragic loss, officials said in a statement. \"We are deeply saddened by the Pankey family's tragic loss,\" they wrote. \"The health and safety of people and pets is always a top priority, and we take the family's concerns very seriously.\"\n\nThe incident recalls the equally tragic case of 5-year-old Noah and 7-year-old Connor Barthe, who were both strangled to death by an escaped African rock python last summer. The snake, which was kept in a pet store located below the apartment where the two boys were sleeping, reportedly made its way through the buildings ventilation system. At 100 lbs., it literally fell through the ceiling, into the home.\n\nGomez hopes that the lawsuit will prevent similar incidents by establishing more effective protocols for evaluating infections among store animals. \"Apparently there was some breakdown in procedures,\u201d he said. \u201cThey want tighter controls.\"", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "aiden pankey, rat kills boy, petco, rat-bite fever, streptobacillus moniliformis infection", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "A lawsuit against Petco charges that 10-year-old Aiden Pankey contracted a fatal bacterial infection from a rat he adopted through the retailer.", "title": "Petco Sued Over 10-Year-Old's Fatal Rat Bite", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/rat-kills-boy-petco-sued-over-10-year-old-aidens-death-rat-bite-fever-270171", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/02/26/rat.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A lawsuit against Petco charges that 10-year-old Aiden Pankey contracted a fatal bacterial infection from a rat he adopted through the retailer.", "title": "Petco Sued Over 10-Year-Old's Fatal Rat Bite", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/rat-kills-boy-petco-sued-over-10-year-old-aidens-death-rat-bite-fever-270171", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/02/26/rat.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/02/26/rat.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2014-02-26T12:50:48-05:00", "modified_time": "2014-02-26T13:15:25-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "A lawsuit against Petco charges that 10-year-old Aiden Pankey contracted a fatal bacterial infection from a rat he adopted through the retailer."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2184\"", "article_summary": "Speaking to The Associated Press, attorney John Gomez said the incident took place only a few weeks after the boy brought home his new pet rat.\n\"We are deeply saddened by the Pankey family's tragic loss,\" they wrote.\nA California family is suing Petco over the death of their 10-year-old son from a bacterial infection they say he contracted from a pet rat adopted through the retailer.\nThat said, it is devastated by the family\u2019s tragic loss, officials said in a statement.\nThe San Diego County medical examiner\u2019s office later determined that the cause of death was streptobacillus moniliformis infection, or rat-bite fever."}
