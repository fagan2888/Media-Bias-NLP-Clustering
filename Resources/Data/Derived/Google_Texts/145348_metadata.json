It asked companies in these sectors whether they offered specific benefits to employees, including major medical coverage, dental insurance, life insurance, vision insurance and disability insurance.\n\nRelated: 10 Best Companies for Pay and Benefits in 2014\n\nAfter manufacturing, the health care sector came in second place, followed by education and financial services companies.

Sixty-three percent of those interviewed also said \u2013 interestingly enough \u2013 that they\u2019d be likely to accept jobs with lower pay if the benefits were good.\n\nHere\u2019s a breakdown of the best and worst industries for specific benefits:\n\nMEDICAL INSURANCE\n\nBest: manufacturing; 87 percent of companies offer it\n\nWorst: retail; 70 percent of companies offer it\n\nDENTAL INSURANCE\n\nBest: manufacturing and health care; 83 percent of companies in these industries offer it\n\nWorst: retail; 67 percent of companies offer it\n\nRelated: Big Increases in Obamacare Premiums and Deductibles Coming in November\n\nLIFE INSURANCE\n\nBest: manufacturing and health care; 74 percent of companies in each industry offer it\n\nWorst: retail; 51 percent of companies offer it\n\nVISION INSURANCE\n\nBest: financial services; 73 percent of companies offer it\n\nWorst: retail; 57 percent of companies offer it\n\nDISABILITY INSURANCE\n\nBest: manufacturing; 71 percent of companies offer it\n\nWorst: retail; 47 percent of companies offer it\n\nAflac based its report on feedback from 1,856 benefits decision-makers and 5,209 employees at small, medium and large companies in these six industries.\n\nGenerally speaking, large companies with more than 500 employees were more likely to offer benefits than medium and small companies, except for major medical insurance.
