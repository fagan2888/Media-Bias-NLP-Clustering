This early detection is infinitely important because it can significantly improve a child\u2019s IQ, social interaction, and language abilities. The National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) has recently awarded 12 grants aimed at providing early diagnosis, treatment, and support for people living with autism spectrum disorder.\n\nIn total, the NIMH grants total $7.9 million for the initial year of project funding. Each of the 12 projects is aimed at a particular age group, covering autistic individuals from birth well into adulthood and falling into three categories: early childhood, transition-age, and adults. According to a recent press release, \u201cthe funding will help to provide models for the delivery of needed services to children, youth, and adults with ASD, across different communities and care settings, appropriate to each age and individual.\u201d The most recent information from the American Psychological Association reports that one in 88 children lives with autism. This is an astonishing 78 percent increase since 2002. Although the reasons for the increase in autism remain somewhat of a mystery, the need for more autism service is widely recognized.\n\nOne of the biggest focuses of these grants is the need for autism strategies to work in every real-world community and health care system, regardless of races, socioeconomic status, or access to services. Research continues to show that non-white children are not only diagnosed less frequently but also much later in life. Also, even after diagnosis, minority families at lower income or education levels are still less likely to enter early intervention therapy. This has the danger of affecting their developmental progress.\n\n\u201cDespite the significant number of people of all ages identified with ASD, access to effective services remains inconsistent at best. Parents are often left to navigate what is available as best they can, and worry for the future as their affected children grow into adulthood,\u201d said NIMH Director Dr. Thomas Insel in the NIH press release. The studies will be used to help make universal care strategies that are transferrable across different communities.\n\nFeatures of ASD include: difficulties in social communication, restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior and interests. Left untreated, a child is put in danger of not developing effective social skills and even failing to learn how to talk and behave appropriately. The Autism Research Institute explains that very few individuals \u201crecover completely from autism without intervention,\u201d but hopefully thanks to this funding less children will ever reach this point.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "nih, awards, 79, m, autism, research, help, provide, services, asd, individuals, all, ages, and", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "The NIH has promised $7.9 million in funding for 12 new projects aimed at better understanding autism and making sure treatment is available to a wider range of ASD individuals.", "title": "NIH Throws Millions Of Dollars Toward Autism Research", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/nih-awards-79-m-autism-research-help-provide-services-asd-individuals-all-ages-and-302438", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/09/10/austism.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The NIH has promised $7.9 million in funding for 12 new projects aimed at better understanding autism and making sure treatment is available to a wider range of ASD individuals.", "title": "NIH Throws Millions Of Dollars Toward Autism Research", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/nih-awards-79-m-autism-research-help-provide-services-asd-individuals-all-ages-and-302438", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/09/10/austism.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/09/10/austism.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Policy/Biz", "published_time": "2014-09-10T16:57:19-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-09-10T16:57:18-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "The NIH has promised $7.9 million in funding for 12 new projects aimed at better understanding autism and making sure treatment is available to a wider range of ASD individuals."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb081\"", "article_summary": "The Autism Research Institute explains that very few individuals \u201crecover completely from autism without intervention,\u201d but hopefully thanks to this funding less children will ever reach this point.\nIn total, the NIMH grants total $7.9 million for the initial year of project funding.\n\u201cDespite the significant number of people of all ages identified with ASD, access to effective services remains inconsistent at best.\nAutism can now be detected in children from as early on as 12 to 18 months, thanks to innovation in research and understanding of autism spectrum disorders (ASD).\nAlthough the reasons for the increase in autism remain somewhat of a mystery, the need for more autism service is widely recognized."}
