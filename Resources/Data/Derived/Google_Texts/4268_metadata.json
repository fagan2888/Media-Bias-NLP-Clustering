They\u2019re starting the process while prisoners are locked up.\n\n\u201cWhen the person is in custody, they\u2019re not eligible for enrollment,\u201d McLean County Sheriff Mike Emery told Illinois Watchdog. \u201cThe stance we\u2019re taking here in McLean County\u2026is that we\u2019re starting the process with inmates to get them enrolled for health care.\u201d\n\nEmery said his staff will fill out almost all of the paperwork for Obamacare so that once someone is released they can sign a few pages and be enrolled in Medicaid, or apply for private insurance. Most will go into Medicaid.\n\nIn Illinois\u2019 prisons, inmates who are set to be released are told they could be covered by Medicaid well before their last day.\n\n\u201cParole school in prisons serves as a primer on what to do upon release,\u201d said Tom Shaer, Illinois\u2019 prison spokesman for Illinois Department of Corrections. \u201cIDOC informs inmates of their rights and opportunities under ACA, just as we inform them of all resources available to them in health care.\u201d\n\nShaer said Illinois hopes to enroll its 28,000 parolees in Obamacare. Most of them would be covered under Medicaid expansion.\n\n\u201cThere are certain portions of IDOC\u2019s inmate population who are currently Medicaid eligible \u2014 the over 65 population and our pregnant female population,\u201d Shaer said.\n\nMedicaid will not pay for care for other inmates who currently serving sentences, he added.\n\nGreg Sullivan, executive director of the Illinois Sheriff\u2019s Association, said the key is where the inmate is sleeping.\n\n\u201cFederal rules say you cannot be on Medicaid and in jail or prison, but once you get out you are covered,\u201d Sullivan said.\n\nThat even applies to short releases. \u201cIf we take you and put you in a hospital, you\u2019re are still covered,\u201d he said.\n\nSullivan said inmate health care is often the second largest cost for a county jail.\n\nCounties are seeing Obamacare as a way to shift some of those health care costs from their budgets to the federal government.\n\n\u201cThere will be some savings,\u201d Emery said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s going to be an immediate savings for county taxpayers.\u201d\n\nIllinois has added 114,000 people to its Medicaid rolls under Obamacare, while no one knows how many people have signed up for private insurance. Republican lawmakers expect to add as many as 500,000 people to Medicaid in the next year.\n\nObamacare is set to pay for all of the costs for three years (and 90 percent after that) for newly eligible Medicaid clients, mostly the young single men who are the same young men coming out of prison or jail.\n\nIllinois spent nearly $12 billion on Medicaid last year. Republicans at the Capitol say Illinois can expect to spend $1 billion more on Medicaid next year, regardless of the extra federal cash. If the federal government pays less than 90 percent of the cost for the young men it is adding to Medicaid, Illinois\u2019 Medicaid spending could skyrocket by more than $6 billion a year.\n\nContact Benjamin Yount at BYount@Watchdog.org or find him on Twitter @BenYount.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Illinois is turning to prisons and jails to find new enrollees for Obamacare", "title": "Illinois focuses Obamacare in prisons, jails", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2013/11/jail.jpg", "updated_time": "2013-11-06T15:15:42+00:00", "url": "http://watchdog.org/114898/illinois-pushes-obamacare-enrollment-prison/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Watchdogorg", "section": "Illinois", "tag": "and prisons,Illinois,Illinois Department of Corrections,inmates and parolees,jails,McLean County,Mike Emery,Obamacare spending", "published_time": "2013-11-07T04:00:20+00:00", "modified_time": "2013-11-06T15:15:42+00:00"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Illinois is turning to prisons and jails to find new enrollees for Obamacare", "title": "Illinois focuses Obamacare in prisons, jails", "image": {"src": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2013/11/jail.jpg"}, "creator": "@watchdogorg", "site": "@watchdogorg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive", "description": "Illinois is turning to prisons and jails to find new enrollees for Obamacare"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc96b7\"", "article_summary": "\u201cParole school in prisons serves as a primer on what to do upon release,\u201d said Tom Shaer, Illinois\u2019 prison spokesman for Illinois Department of Corrections.\nIf the federal government pays less than 90 percent of the cost for the young men it is adding to Medicaid, Illinois\u2019 Medicaid spending could skyrocket by more than $6 billion a year.\nIn Illinois\u2019 prisons, inmates who are set to be released are told they could be covered by Medicaid well before their last day.\nCounties are seeing Obamacare as a way to shift some of those health care costs from their budgets to the federal government.\nThe state\u2019s prisons and county jails are taking a proactive approach to enrolling people, mostly into Medicaid, through the Affordable Care Act."}
