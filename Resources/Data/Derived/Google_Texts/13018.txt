The story of its origin varies a little, but the phrase caught on across the country in the 1980s. It’s a thoughtful way of encouraging kindness, of course, but the phrase just didn’t “take” with me. Being in seminary at the time, and trying to learn a whole lot of other things that were even harder to grasp than random acts of kindness, I set aside my dissatisfaction with the phrase. I needed to concentrate on trying to understand God, Jesus, the Religious Society of Friends (Quakers) and why so many people had opinions that were so different from mine on all those things and more.
