Eight Swiss research scientists at the Nestl\u00e9 Institute of Health Sciences headquarters in Geneva say they\u2019ve figured out how an enzyme that\u2019s responsible for regulating metabolism can be controlled. They were successful in their first step to stimulate the compound C13, which mimics the fat-burning effect of exercise. Their findings were published in the journal Chemistry & Biology.\n\nIf people won\u2019t exercise maybe they\u2019ll be more inclined to drink chemicals that may trigger the same effects. Diet pills have been around for decades, but they haven\u2019t been able to break fat down in the way Nestl\u00e9\u2019s drink may be able to. The scientists were searching for a way to naturally start the fat burning process in the body without having to get off the couch.\n\nThe key enzyme AMPK is the master switch that burns sugar and fat in the body. Scientists tried targeting the enzyme with a trial-and-error process. They experimented with different kinds of fruit and plant extracts to see which ones would work for an obese, diabetic, or older immobile person. But will stimulating weight loss in a person without exercise be enough to jumpstart a healthy lifestyle? With exercise comes happy hormones called endorphins, which can block feelings of pain and boost mood. A drink can\u2019t do that.\n\nIn the United States, there are 78.6 million adults who are clinically obese, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The cause of the obesity epidemic is multifaceted and one drink isn\u2019t going to solve the problem. But the question remains: Can it put people on the right track? Maybe losing weight with a drink will encourage them to continue their journey toward a healthier, higher quality of life. There are so many obesity-related conditions, such as type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and stroke, which are all preventable without the dangerous weight.\n\n\u201cThe enzyme can help people who can\u2019t tolerate or continue rigorous exercise,\u201d Nestl\u00e9 diabetes and circadian rhythm scientist Kei Sakamoto, told Bloomberg News. \u201cInstead of 20 minutes of jogging or 40 minutes of cycling, it may help boost metabolism with moderate exercise like brisk walking. They\u2019d get similar effects with less strain.\u201d\n\nThis is Nestl\u00e9\u2019s attempt at breaking into a new arena of weight loss products. The crossover from food into pharmaceuticals is an increasingly popular move. Merck & Co. and Dr. Reddy\u2019s Laboratories Ltd. have all tried to target AMPK, but haven't yet found success.\n\n\u201cA successful attempt in producing metabolic-assisting foods that mimic exercise would be marvelous \u2014 the holy grail,\u201d Naveed Sattar, a professor of metabolic medicine at the University of Glasgow, told Bloomberg. \u201cBut there\u2019s no such thing as a free lunch. So far, no such product has ever passed clinical trials.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "nestles, exercise, bottle, may, give, obese, people, jumpstart, healthier, lifestyle", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Exercise may be replaced with a drink to help put obese people back on a healthy track.", "title": "Nestl\u00e9's 'Exercise In A Bottle' May Jumpstart Weight Loss", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/nestles-exercise-bottle-may-give-obese-people-jumpstart-healthier-lifestyle-311890", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/11/23/nestles-exercise-bottle.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Exercise may be replaced with a drink to help put obese people back on a healthy track.", "title": "Nestl\u00e9's 'Exercise In A Bottle' May Jumpstart Weight Loss", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/nestles-exercise-bottle-may-give-obese-people-jumpstart-healthier-lifestyle-311890", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/11/23/nestles-exercise-bottle.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/11/23/nestles-exercise-bottle.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Vitality", "published_time": "2014-11-23T13:05:15-05:00", "modified_time": "2014-11-23T13:16:36-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Exercise may be replaced with a drink to help put obese people back on a healthy track."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9ea9\"", "article_summary": "But will stimulating weight loss in a person without exercise be enough to jumpstart a healthy lifestyle?\nThey were successful in their first step to stimulate the compound C13, which mimics the fat-burning effect of exercise.\nIf people won\u2019t exercise maybe they\u2019ll be more inclined to drink chemicals that may trigger the same effects.\nMaybe losing weight with a drink will encourage them to continue their journey toward a healthier, higher quality of life.\nScientists tried targeting the enzyme with a trial-and-error process."}
