Sebelius disputed Rep. John Shimkus\u2019 (R-IL) claim that offering prevention benefits without cost sharing would increase beneficiaries\u2019 health care expenses. \u201cThere is no free lunch, Madam Secretary!,\u201d Shimkus charged. \u201cWhen you mandate coverage, it is rolled directly on premiums, premiums increase, that is paying for these services!\u201d Sebelius responded by arguing that investing in prevention could decrease costs down the road.\n\nShimkus grew visibly agitated by her explanation and tried to compare Sebelius to the leaders of North Korea. But rather than referencing the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea (DPRK), Shimkus likened the Secretary to the \u201cRepublic of Korea\u201d or South Korea, America\u2019s ally in the region. \u201cAlright, I got it. We\u2019re just going to agree to disagree. It\u2019s like talking to the Republic of Korea or something,\u201d he said.\n\nWatch it:\n\nA helpful guide:\n\nA Democratic congressman loudly objected, saying that Shimkus should at least allow Sebelius to answer his questions. \u201cI do not have to allow her to answer the question!\u201d Shimkus screamed in reply.\n\nGraphic by Adam Peck.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "\"I do not have to allow her to answer the question!\" Rep.
