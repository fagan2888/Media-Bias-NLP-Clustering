Cue the flashing lights of an ambulance, with rushing doctors and nurses in an emergency room.\n\nBut rarely in the spotlight are the follow-up visits and unexpected re-hospitalizations \u2014 detours on the road to recovery for many patients.\n\nFederal healthcare programs penalize hospitals that have patients who are readmitted without advance notice within 30 days of a procedure.\n\nThese 30-day unplanned readmission rates are an indicator used by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services in an effort to reduce costs for the federal healthcare programs.\n\nAs businesses \u2014 even nonprofits \u2014 hospitals have a bottom line and readmissions cut into their net income. Nationwide, the penalties averaged $125,000 per hospital and totaled $280 million in 2013,according to the CMS data analyzed by the Commonwealth Fund, a private foundation.\n\nEvery hospital in the Rio Grande Valley was levied penalties from the federal government since 2011, after the Affordable Care Act was enacted.\n\nDue to the way that Medicare payments are released to hospitals, which is based on a percentage rather than for each procedure, the exact penalties levied against Valley hospitals cannot be estimated for individual facilities.\n\n\u201cSadly you will not be able to independently calculate penalties,\u201d said Eric Coleman, head of healthcare policy and research at the University of Colorado who has spent two decades studying ways to reduce medical discrepancies. In 2012, Coleman was awarded a MacArthur \u2018genius\u2019 grant for his work.\n\nHe said readmission rates have been an important indicator for decades but widely ignored by hospitals because there wasn\u2019t a strict financial stick.\n\n\u201cI would say in 2014 hospitals are by and large paying attention,\u201d he said, adding that the average cost of a Medicare beneficiary\u2019s readmission for each service is $9,600.\n\nREADMISSION REASONS \u2018ARE COMPLEX\u2019\n\nThe penalties are tied to readmission rates, and in 2011 all hospitals in the Valley had at least a quarter of patients return unexpectedly within 30 days of treatment. Since then, the rates have dropped but some hospitals remained above the national patient readmission average of 16 percent in 2013.\n\nStarr County Memorial Hospital had the most money taken away from the hospital\u2019s budget from Medicare payments in 2014. Hospital officials did not reply to several requests for comment for this story.\n\nMission Regional Medical Center had the highest readmission rate across the Valley, with 18 percent in 2013.\n\n\u201cThe reasons for readmissions are complex, often out of a hospital\u2019s control, and may reflect demographics of the community and its population,\u201d said Nick Espinosa, the hospital\u2019s spokesman. \u201cDifferences in hospital readmission rates are more closely linked to the patient socioeconomic and community factors than to hospital performance.\u201d\n\nEspinosa added that new strategies implemented by the hospital since the Affordable Care Act reforms have been rolled out, like Project Re-Engineered Discharge (RED), a 12-point system that aims to reduce readmissions.\n\nEspinosa countered the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services rates with other data collected by Premier, a national hospital alliance representing 2,800 U.S. hospitals. In the last six quarters, Mission Regional had nearly a 7 percent readmission rate, according to Premier\u2019s data.\n\nFederal data is the only unbiased information widely available to the public and updated on a regular basis.\n\n\u201cOur community takes these numbers and these outcomes very seriously,\u201d said Israel Rocha, CEO of Doctors Hospital at Renaissance, about readmission rate figures.\n\nRocha said that the hospital created what he termed a \u201cpatient navigation system\u201d where patients were offered a lifeline of advocates throughout their visit to ease the transition back home.\n\n\u201cThe amount of investment that we\u2019re doing to ensure we have clinical quality standards far exceeds any penalty that would be assessed on readmissions,\" he said.\n\nRocha pointed to a 2013 Journal of American Medical Association study that noted an 11-percent reduction in re-hospitalizations of Medicare patients in the Rio Grande Valley as a mark of the region\u2019s improvements.\n\nAdriana Morales, spokeswoman for Rio Grande Regional Hospital in McAllen and Valley Regional Medical Center in Brownsville, also highlighted the hospitals\u2019 individual efforts.\n\n\u201cDuring the discharge process, each patient and their family receives education about their home care, information about needed resources and tools identified by case management, and medication counseling,\u201d said Morales of both hospitals, which are affiliated with the Hospital Corporation of America, the nation\u2019s largest hospital conglomerate.\n\nKnapp Medical Center in Weslaco declined an interview, but released a statement on its 15.1 percent readmission rate.\n\n\u201cKnapp Medical Center has demonstrated a commitment to providing excellent patient care for more than 50 years.\u201d said Dinah Gonzalez, hospital spokeswoman, adding that they\u2019ve introduced new processes to improve its numbers.\n\nOfficials with South Texas Health System, which owns several local hospitals including McAllen Medical Center and Edinburg Regional Hospital, declined requests for an interview for this story, but released the following statement:\n\n\u201cThe STHS readmission rate is consistent or better than other hospitals in the area,\u201d company spokeswoman Cari Lambrecht said.\n\nWhen asked about the financial impact, the hospital declined to disclose any penalty totals \u2014 as did all hospitals contacted for this story.\n\n\u2018THEY END UP RETURNING\u2019\n\nTo help tighten the federal budget, Medicare penalized more than 2,200 hospitals nationwide and 169 in Texas that had readmission rates higher than the national average.\n\n\u201cThere were all these different pieces in the Affordable Care Act and they were supposed to be implemented in hospitals, and one was to be more efficient on the Medicare side,\u201d said Anne Dunkelberg, associate director for the Center for Public Policy Priorities, an Austin-based nonprofit think tank.\n\n\u201cIt would be partly offset by Medicaid, and they would start to get paid for people who were part of their charity care before, but in Texas and other states that don\u2019t move forward, the hospitals don\u2019t have that,\u201d Dunkelberg said about Gov. Rick Perry\u2019s decision not to expand Medicaid for Texans in the healthcare gap \u2014 working individuals with income 100 percent above the poverty line who don\u2019t qualify for Medicaid or Medicare. \u201cThat\u2019s a really big hit on them not having that population being taken care of.\u201d\n\nLance Lunsford, spokesperson for the Texas Hospital Association, said there are unfair penalties for so-called safety hospitals that draw patients with mostly low incomes and no private insurance.\n\nHe added that hospitals are penalized without being able to control what happens when patients leave.\n\n\u201cAs a result, they end up returning to the hospital,\u201d he said.\n\nkmosbrucker@themonitor.com\n\nFor the most complete version of this story, log in or subscribe to MyMonitorNews.com.", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "The Monitor", "description": "Hospitals can go largely unnoticed until someone needs one.
