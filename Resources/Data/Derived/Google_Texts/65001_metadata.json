Hawaii, Indiana and Ohio limit Medicaid coverage to patients who live a minimum distance from their providers. (In Indiana, for example, the standard is 20 miles.) Another significant hurdle is that each state licenses the doctors who practice within its borders, so a doctor licensed in one state cannot see a patient digitally in another state without getting a license there.\n\nBecause of those barriers, patients who are elderly, infirm, isolated or busy may be denied full access to health care, said Latoya Thomas, director of state health policy at the American Telemedicine Association (ATA).\n\nStates that have been slower to embrace telemedicine, including Arkansas, Rhode Island and Texas, are merely being prudent, waiting to be assured that the approach does not diminish the quality of care that patients receive, say some physician regulatory boards. \u201cThere is a concern that whatever is put in place not be dangerous,\u201d said Lisa Robin, chief advocacy officer for the Federation of State Medical Boards, which represents the state agencies that license and discipline doctors.\n\nThose pushing for a less restrictive approach say telemedicine is not an inferior method but a vehicle for extending quality health care to more places. And, they argue, some policies curbing telemedicine have been motivated by fear of competition among more-traditional practitioners.\n\n\u201cIn some states, the issue comes down to protecting their doctors from outside competition,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cTheir doctors with brick-and-mortar practices assume that someone who uses telemedicine is trying to take away patients.\u201d\n\nTelemedicine\u2019s origins date to the early days of the U.S. space program, when NASA scientists developed technology that enabled doctors to monitor astronauts in space. Thanks to rapid advances in technology, telemedicine developed quickly, principally to link physicians to remote populations in such places as Alaska and Arizona\u2019s Tohono O\u2019odham Indian reservation, which borders Mexico west of Tucson.\n\nTelemedicine also spread from rural to urban areas. Doctors now monitor or communicate with patients from afar on everything from routine preventive care to chronic disease management and psychiatric conditions. Primary care doctors and their patients consult with specialists and diagnosticians who might otherwise be beyond their geographic reach.\n\nThe approach received a major boost from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 and the Affordable Care Act of 2010, both of which increased federal spending on health information technology and telemedicine. President Obama has often extolled its potential to increase access to quality health care while cutting costs. Nearly 13 million Americans use telemedicine, according to Gary Capistrant, senior director of policy at the ATA.\n\nRegulating coverage\n\nAs the use of telemedicine became more common in the 2000s, more state legislatures and regulatory boards adopted telemedicine policies. (The Center for Connected Health Policy has compiled a state-by-state list.)\n\nTwenty-nine states require private insurers to pay for telemedicine at the same rate as in-person services, according to the ATA.\n\nIn addition, Medicaid programs in 48 states and the District offer at least some coverage for telemedicine. (Connecticut and Rhode Island are the only states that largely refuse to pay for telemedicine in their Medicaid programs.) About half of state Medicaid programs require that a patient be in a medical facility during telemedicine encounters rather than at home.\n\nMany states have also adopted laws and policies concerning how physicians practice telemedicine. Some require that a health professional be physically present with a patient during a telemedicine session. Most require patients to sign special consent forms.\n\nSome states require in-person follow-ups. Texas is locked in a federal lawsuit with Teladoc, a service that digitally links patients and doctors, over the state\u2019s requirement that physicians either meet with patients in person before moving to a digital relationship or have other providers physically present with patients when treating them remotely for the first time. Arkansas has a similar law.\n\nRussell Thomas, a former member of the Texas Medical Board and the Federation of State Medical Boards, uses videoconferencing to provide primary care to at-risk students at a high school 300 miles away from his family practice in Eagle Lake, Tex. He also consults with cardiologists and dermatologists in Houston for his patients.\n\nNot only digital\n\nDoctors should first meet with patients before moving to a digital relationship, he said. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine that I can provide the best care to my patients if I never laid eyes on them, if I never physically assessed them.\u201d\n\nThe ATA says that telemedicine should be governed by the same rules that apply to traditional care. \u201cOur belief is that if you license a health-care provider, you expect them to uphold the standard of care \u2014 whatever tools they are using,\u201d the ATA\u2019s Thomas said. In other words, each physician who practices telemedicine should determine whether a remote session suffices or a face-to-face visit is necessary.\n\nStates that put additional requirements on telemedicine, she said, are depriving people of access to medical care. \u201cIt\u2019s a delivery model that may not be familiar to everyone, but where it is available, it should be used fully.\u201d\n\nThis article was produced by Stateline, an initiative of the Pew Charitable Trusts.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "health", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Telemedicine can bring health care within reach in cost-effective ways, advocates say.", "title": "When the doctor is far away, here\u2019s how the distance can shrink", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/when-the-doctor-is-far-away-heres-how-the-distance-can-shrink/2015/11/23/37c9df72-817b-11e5-9afb-0c971f713d0c_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2015/11/23/Web-Resampled/2015-11-23/telemedicine_detail_istockphoto-k3zC--358x328@wp.com.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/when-the-doctor-is-far-away-heres-how-the-distance-can-shrink/2015/11/23/37c9df72-817b-11e5-9afb-0c971f713d0c_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "health", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost"}, "eomportal-uuid": "37c9df72-817b-11e5-9afb-0c971f713d0c", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "description": "Telemedicine can bring health care within reach in cost-effective ways, advocates say."}, "article_summary": "President Obama has often extolled its potential to increase access to quality health care while cutting costs.\nPrimary care doctors and their patients consult with specialists and diagnosticians who might otherwise be beyond their geographic reach.\nTwenty-nine states require private insurers to pay for telemedicine at the same rate as in-person services, according to the ATA.\nTelemedicine has been praised as a cost-effective approach, enabling physicians to monitor their patients\u2019 medical conditions and consult with specialists in a way that overcomes time and distance.\nStates that put additional requirements on telemedicine, she said, are depriving people of access to medical care."}
