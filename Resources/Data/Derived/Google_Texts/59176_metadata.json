The independent auditors made as many as 68 specific recommendations to help strengthen the agency\u2019s operations and ultimately make better use of its resources.\n\nNow a new audit from Inspector General John Roth lists the most glaring problems that have plagued an agency that has over 500,000 federal workers and contractors and whose annual operating budget is about $60 billion. Auditors gave 68 specific recommendations for tightening up operations, and Roth said the agency must address the following issues and more to prevent hundreds of millions of tax dollars from being grossly misspent:\n\nAcquisitions/Money Management\n\nLike many of the larger government agencies, DHS has had major acquisitions and money management issues. In the 2014 audit, the IG said the agency did not follow departmental acquisition guidance, which resulted in serious cost overruns, lackluster acquisition performance and projects that went way past deadline.\n\nFor example, in 2012, DHS vastly overestimated how many vehicles it would need in its fleet \u2013 and ended up spending $36 million on vehicles that were hardly ever used. In another example, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, which is part of DHS, spent at least $17 million on a housing project in Ajo, Arizona, including hundreds of thousands of dollars for standard houses while millions were spent on unused mobile homes.\n\nWith an acquisition budget of about $18 billion, DHS does not have sufficient oversight of that budget, said Roth.\n\nRelated: Federal Employees Do Union Work on Taxpayers\u2019 Dime\n\n\u201cThe Department\u2019s programs continue to have problems with schedule delays, cost overruns, and delivering promised capabilities,\u201d he said in the report. \u201cAdditionally, lack of coordination among components can lead to program redundancy, inefficient use of resources, and security risks to programs.\u201d\n\nFinancial Reporting/Grant Oversight\n\nDHS as a whole and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) in particular have struggled with administering grants and keeping track of where that money is going.\n\nFEMA has been the subject of a number of IG audits noting the agency\u2019s botched work in doling out emergency relief to victims of Hurricanes Katrina, Isaac and Sandy, along with other disasters around the country.\n\nJust last month, the agency began asking Sandy victims who were improperly awarded money to give it back \u2013 two years later. Roth noted that FEMA has improved its grant oversight, but still has work to do.\n\nEmployee Accountability and Integrity\n\nOver the last several years, DHS workers pocketed millions of dollars in unearned overtime while supervisors looked the other way.\n\nThe scam was so engrained in office culture that some managers were using the unearned overtime fund as a recruitment tool. Taking from the agency\u2019s \u201ccandy bowl\u201d increased some DHS employees\u2019 annual income by as much as 24 percent, courtesy of the taxpayer.\n\nThe IG also recommended that DHS improve its oversight and management of programs relating to cyber security and insider threats, transportation security, border security and immigration enforcement \u2013 or just about every area it handles. The agency agreed to the IG\u2019s recommendations and said that management would implement corrective actions.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The sprawling Department of Homeland Security (DHS), created after 9/11 to keep the co", "title": "68 Ways Homeland Security Has Wasted Your Tax Dollars", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2014/11/26/68-Ways-Homeland-Security-Has-Wasted-Your-Tax-Dollars", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/Homeland_Security_Sign.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2014/11/26/68-Ways-Homeland-Security-Has-Wasted-Your-Tax-Dollars", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/Homeland_Security_Sign.jpg", "creator": "@Briannaehley", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "The sprawling Department of Homeland Security (DHS), created after 9/11 to keep the co", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdcc35\"", "article_summary": "With an acquisition budget of about $18 billion, DHS does not have sufficient oversight of that budget, said Roth.\nThe IG also recommended that DHS improve its oversight and management of programs relating to cyber security and insider threats, transportation security, border security and immigration enforcement \u2013 or just about every area it handles.\nEmployee Accountability and IntegrityOver the last several years, DHS workers pocketed millions of dollars in unearned overtime while supervisors looked the other way.\nThe independent auditors made as many as 68 specific recommendations to help strengthen the agency\u2019s operations and ultimately make better use of its resources.\nRelated: Millions Wasted by DHS on Unused VehiclesWHY THIS MATTERSThe IG report minced no words: \u201cSound financial practices\u201d and \u201ceffective internal controls\u201d are critical to running this $60 billion government agency effectively."}
