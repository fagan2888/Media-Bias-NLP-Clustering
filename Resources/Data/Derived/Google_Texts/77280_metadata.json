They\u2019re not that far apart on a handful of important matters.\n\nIn fact, on several issues, they dovetail. One guy is so far-right, the other so far-left, they end up intersecting in places I\u2019m sure they don\u2019t even recognize. It\u2019s like running into your third grade teacher at a S&M bar in Cambodia. Like, \u201cHey! What are you doing here?!\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s weird these two guys, so outside the lines on opposite ends, find common ground. Almost makes you wish they were one person. Berald Trumders. Or Donernie Sandump. Either way.\n\nFirst though, let\u2019s get the non-alike parts of them out of the way, which are many and important (and most of the following comes from pbs.org). Sanders wants to raise taxes on the wealthy, on corporations, on anyone in rarefied financial air. Trump wants to cut taxes everywhere for everyone. They also don\u2019t agree on climate change. Trump thinks it\u2019s a hoax, and Sanders thinks global warming might do us all in and wants to charge companies for their carbon emissions.\n\nAnd as for immigration, well \u2026 Sanders supports a path to citizenship. Trump wants to create a moat around the United States and fill it with alligators and demons and militias.\n\nBut where they agree \u2026\n\nBlow up the Trans-Pacific Partnership: Sanders calls it a \u201cdisastrous\u201d trade agreement, Trump calls it a \u201cbad deal,\u201d both think it will hurt American businesses and American workers. This potential partnership was initiated by President George W. Bush and continued by President Barack Obama. Wide support on both sides of the aisle.\n\nSocial Security, Medicaid, other entitlements: Trump doesn\u2019t want to cut these entitlement programs. Neither does Sanders.\n\nGuns: Sanders doesn\u2019t think there should be a federal waiting period for handguns and he wants to ban assault weapons. Trump agrees on assault weapons, but thinks a small waiting period is OK for handguns.\n\nHealthcare: Sanders wants to go to a single payer system, much like Canada\u2019s. Trump? Hard to say exactly where he stands now \u2014 he does want to get rid of Obamacare \u2014 but in his book \u201cThe America We Deserve\u201d he wrote we should have a universal healthcare system much like the one in \u2026 Canada.\n\nCampaign finance: Sanders wants to limit corporate donations, Trump told RealClearPolitics that \u201cThe problem with this country is, no politician makes a legitimate decision because they\u2019re controlled by their donors and by their super PACs, and also they\u2019re controlled by lobbyists.\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s tally it up so far: They both think American jobs should stay in America, they both think entitlement programs for America\u2019s seniors should be preserved, they both agree on guns, they both seem to agree on healthcare, and they both think the political system is broken because of corporate influence.\n\nI mean, dudes: Find some common ground on immigration and taxes, let the scientists deal with global warming, and I\u2019ll tell you what: You guys might win the election if you ran as a third party.\n\nFrom SmartBrief: Only 38 percent of Americans support the Trans-Pacific Partnership.\n\nFrom Gallup: Over 75 percent of Americans worry about Social Security.\n\nFrom Gallup: Nearly 75 percent of Americans believe they have a right to a handgun, and over 60 percent want to ban assault weapons.\n\nFrom Gallup: Half the nation wants all federal elections to be government-funded only. No private money at all.\n\nNow listen: I\u2019m not saying Trump and Sanders are cut from the same ideological cloth. Clearly, they\u2019re not. But the fact they agree on so much does point to the possibility that a third party candidate \u2014 with the right messages, and on the right side of the polls \u2014 could actually, maybe, win.\n\nI\u2019m sure I\u2019m not the only person who realizes this. I\u2019m reasonably sure we might find this little theory put to the test in 2016.\n\nJeff Edelstein is a columnist for The Trentonian.
