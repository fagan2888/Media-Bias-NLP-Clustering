I had the privilege of serving on the Committee for the last two years, involved both in the writing of the report itself and in coming to consensus on its recommendations.\n\nThe name of the report and the charge to the Committee from the IOM was focused on \u201cend of life.\u201d However, the title, \u201cDying in America,\u201d is something of a misnomer. The report itself focuses extensively on people with serious and chronic illness with indeterminate prognoses, why the current health care system fails so consistently to meet their needs, and what must change to improve the situation.\n\nHospice is the gold standard of care quality for those that are predictably dying and clearly at the end of life, and we are fortunate as a nation to have such a strong (mostly home) hospice infrastructure, but that\u2019s not where most of the problems lie. The problems lie in the lack of options for people who are either not hospice-eligible (prognosis uncertain or continuing to want and benefit from disease treatment) or are referred to hospice much too late in their disease course to influence their experience and their families\u2019.\n\nThe new report builds on the 1998 IOM report \u201cApproaching Death\u201d and goes well beyond the usual nostrums of calling for reimbursement for advance care planning and decrying all the \u201cwaste\u201d in health care spending during the last year of life.\n\nWhy We Took A Broader Perspective Than Just End-Of-Life Care\n\nThe sickest most vulnerable (and logically, costliest) patients are those at highest risk of dying. Since we cannot know in prospect, but only in retrospect, who will die and who will respond well to treatment, we cannot use prognostication as a reliable or actionable basis for policy and practice until very late in the disease course, when our ability to predict remaining life span gains in accuracy. In addition, the attack on end of life spending as the main driver of runaway costs is not supported by data. In a commissioned paper from Amy Kelley and Melissa Aldridge, the Committee found that only 11 percent of the costliest 5 percent of patients in the U.S. are in their last 12 months of life. Nearly half of the costliest 5 percent have one-time only high costs \u2014 for example, a major surgical procedure \u2014 but then recover, and their costs drop down to baseline.\n\nThe remaining 40 percent of the costliest 5 percent have persistent high spending year after year because of chronic debilitating conditions such as dementia, frailty, functional dependency, multimorbidity, and mental illness. These people are seriously ill with ongoing acute and long-term care needs from the health care system, but they are not (predictably) dying. Using prognosis and the \u201cend of life\u201d label will therefore fail to identify and meet the needs of most of these people who now use the very costly and high-risk acute care system (911 calls, ED visits, hospitalizations) to manage their chronic illnesses because they have no meaningful alternatives.\n\nCostliest 5 Percent of Patients\n\nTwo Potential Game Changers\n\nUniversal palliative care education. The new IOM report calls for two fundamental and profound changes in organized medicine, that, if we can implement them, will meaningfully improve quality of care for our patients \u2014 those who are living with serious chronic illness, as well as those who may die in the next year or two.\n\nThe first (see page 4, recommendation 3) is a call for universal health professional and clinician (physician, nurses, social workers, others) education and training in the core principles and practices of palliative care: pain and symptom management; safe and effective use of opioids; skilled communication about what matters most to patients and their families and how the health care system can help achieve those goals; and seamless, well-coordinated and well-communicated care across multiple settings of care over time.\n\n\n\nThe fact that the vast majority of today\u2019s practitioners have had no meaningful training in these essential skills is surprising to the general public, but this educational deficit explains a lot of what happens to us when we are extremely sick. Without fundamental change in health professional training, it doesn\u2019t matter how we change payment and system design; clinicians will continue to practice as they are trained \u2014 to diagnose and treat disease no matter what \u2014 even when such actions no longer help and may cause harm.\n\nThe challenge before us now is to work within our own teaching organizations to change how and what is taught. All meaningful change is local, and all meaningful change requires effective local leadership. A great example of our field\u2019s readiness to support the IOM\u2019s call for scaleable training of all practitioners in essential communication skills comes from colleagues Tony Back, Bob Arnold, James Tulsky, and the rest of the VitalTalk team (@vitaltalk).\n\nCoverage of patients\u2019 social needs. The second game-changing recommendation (see page 4, recommendation 4) in the IOM report calls for coverage of both social and medical needs among the sickest and most complex patients.\n\nEstimates vary slightly, but roughly 40 percent of all medical spending is precipitated by unmet social support needs: low literacy; language barriers; poor nutrition; unsafe housing; family violence; mental illness; and, most important, the absence of support for exhausted and overwhelmed family caregivers. Why don\u2019t we already pay for these services? It is prohibited by law under the Medicare statute, which covers only those services that are \u201cmedically necessary.\u201d\n\nInterestingly, as our payment system moves from the fee-for-service, pay-for-volume system of the past towards versions of global budgeting, bundling, and capitation where providers accept financial risk and become more focused on quality than quantity, recognition of the inextricable association of social determinants with health care utilization is leading to change. We are seeing medical center operating dollars spent on social supports.\n\nOne example of progress in this direction comes from my own hospital, which responded to the 30-day readmission penalties imposed by Medicare in the Affordable Care Act by hiring 80 social workers to go out into the community to identify and address the social determinants of frequent emergency room and hospital use. The problems these social workers identified involved unsafe housing, lack of family support, high levels of family violence and trauma, low literacy, language barriers, untreated mental illness, and overwhelmed family caregivers. When these issues were addressed, 30-day readmissions plummeted.\n\nAs access to palliative care moves beyond hospitals to home, long-term care and other community settings, the ability to integrate social and medical support services will be critical to the success and sustainability of these new delivery and payment models.\n\nThe IOM Report\u2019s Call For Action Is Only The First Step\n\nIf this report is to translate into action, many entrenched interests and bureaucracies will have to change. This will only happen through advocacy and public demand for fundamental transformation of how we care for our sickest and most vulnerable citizens. Encouragingly, the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network has prioritized palliative care in its advocacy agenda, and several broad national coalitions have formed to achieve these goals \u2014 the Patient Quality of Life Coalition and the Coalition to Transform Advanced Care, among others. I urge readers to add their voices to these efforts.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://healthaffairs.org/blog/2014/09/24/iom-report-calls-for-transformation-of-care-for-the-seriously-ill/", "site_name": "Health Affairs", "image": "http://healthaffairs.org/blog/wp-content/themes/HealthAffairs2015/images/facebook-default.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "IOM Report Calls For Transformation Of Care For The Seriously Ill"}, "description": "IOM Report Calls For Transformation Of Care For The Seriously Ill | At the intersection of health, health care, and policy.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe10b2\"", "article_summary": "These people are seriously ill with ongoing acute and long-term care needs from the health care system, but they are not (predictably) dying.\nDiane MeierSeptember 24, 2014The new Institute of Medicine (IOM) report on care near the end of life in the United States was released last week.\nThe new report builds on the 1998 IOM report \u201cApproaching Death\u201d and goes well beyond the usual nostrums of calling for reimbursement for advance care planning and decrying all the \u201cwaste\u201d in health care spending during the last year of life.\nThe second game-changing recommendation (see page 4, recommendation 4) in the IOM report calls for coverage of both social and medical needs among the sickest and most complex patients.\nCoverage of patients\u2019 social needs."}
