The name of the dead person has not been released.\n\n\u201cWe heard three shots \u2014 boom, boom, boom,\u201d said Jeff Leib, a passerby and former Denver Post staff writer.\n\nWithin a minute or so, fire engines and police cars descended on the scene.\n\n\u201cWithin minutes, they were wheeling someone away from the bank on a stretcher,\u201d Leib said.\n\nThe alleged robber had taken money from a teller and was leaving the bank in the 6300 block of East Colfax when the off-duty officer fatally shot him at about 10:43 a.m., Denver police spokesman Sonny Jackson said.\n\nPolice Chief Robert White said the suspect \u201cpointed a weapon\u201d at the officer. Jackson said the weapon appeared to be a gun.\n\nWhite said the officer, whose name has not been released, has been placed on administrative leave pending an investigation.\n\nParamedics pushed a stretcher up to an ambulance parked outside the bank, which is located in a residential neighborhood, Leib said. It appeared that there was a person on the stretcher beneath a blanket, he added.\n\nWestbound Colfax Avenue was blocked at Leyden Street and Monaco Parkway during the investigation.\n\nAbout a dozen police cars and the police department\u2019s crime lab responded to the scene. They put crime tape around the scene and across Colfax Avenue.\n\nThe officer was not injured. Another police officer was going door to door, speaking to residents.\n\n\u201cAll I can tell you is that officers are OK and there are no suspects on the loose,\u201d a police officer said, according to Leib.\n\nLeib said the same bank has been robbed repeatedly and that the bank hired off-duty police officers to guard the bank. They would stand in the corner of the bank wearing their uniforms, Leib said.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Off-duty policeman fatally shoots Denver bank robbery suspect", "title": "Off-duty policeman fatally shoots Denver bank robbery suspect", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2013/09/21/off-duty-policeman-fatally-shoots-denver-bank-robbery-suspect/", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20130921_112451_officer-involved-shooting-1.jpg", "height": 448}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20130921_112451_officer-involved-shooting-1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2013-09-21T11:27:10+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-29T10:04:38+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe05c2\"", "article_summary": "\u201cWe heard three shots \u2014 boom, boom, boom,\u201d said Jeff Leib, a passerby and former Denver Post staff writer.\nLeib said the same bank has been robbed repeatedly and that the bank hired off-duty police officers to guard the bank.\n\u201cWithin minutes, they were wheeling someone away from the bank on a stretcher,\u201d Leib said.\nJackson said the weapon appeared to be a gun.\nAn armed, off-duty police officer in uniform shot and killed a bank robbery suspect after the man pointed what appeared to be a gun at the officer Saturday morning, police say."}
