The findings are based on a sample of 2,200 employers and 10,500 participants using Zane Benefits\u2019 software during the 2015 calendar year.\n\nHere are highlights from the report on the type of companies adopting employer-funded individual health insurance:\n\nEmployers are predominantly small employers - those with one to 49 employees. The average number of eligible employees enrolled is nine (9).\n\nThe most prominent industries represented in the study are healthcare (16 percent of employers), manufacturing (13 percent), non-profit organizations (11 percent), consulting firms (8 percent), and construction (8 percent).\n\nEmployers are spread out across the nation with 11 percent from the East, 21 percent from the Midwest, 38 percent from the South, and 30 percent from the West.\n\nWhy Companies are Adopting Employer-Funded Individual Health Insurance\n\nEmployer-funded individual health Insurance is being rapidly adopted by smaller employers because of these five key reason:\n\nCost Savings - On average, individual health insurance costs less. According to the study, employers using Zane Benefits\u2019 software realized cost savings of 57 percent, on average, compared to average group health insurance costs.\n\nPredictability and Control - Employers set the maximum contribution (reimbursement) amount, which provides predictability and control. Unlike group traditional health insurance policies, there are no annual rate hikes and no minimum employer contribution amounts.\n\nTax Benefits - By using a tax-free reimbursement plan, employers and employees receive tax advantages.\n\nEmployee Choice - With this type of health benefit, employees select and purchase the individual policy of their choice. Employees may select any policy, from any carrier. Eligible employees may access the federal subsidies for additional savings.\n\nNo Employer Mandate - Under the Affordable Care Act, smaller employers are not mandated to offer traditional health insurance to employees. As such, smaller employers may offer individual health insurance reimbursement without having to factor in Employer Shared Responsibility Fees, which do not apply to smaller employers.\n\nConclusion\n\nEmployers all over the nation are implementing employer-funded individual health insurance solutions as an alternative to traditional group health insurance benefits. What type of companies are adopting this benefit model? According to the study, it is primarily small and micro employers across many regions and industries.\n\nWhat questions do you have about who is adopting employer-funded individual health insurance?
