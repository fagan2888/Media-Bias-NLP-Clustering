President Barack Obama is with it: He was on Facebook before your parents, has an iPad, and is best buds with YouTube celebrities.

To reach young netizens, the president will be responding to questions with popular YouTube personalities Bethany Mota, GloZell, and Hank Green.

These digital celebs have been fielding questions from their rabid fan base, and via Twitter through the hashtag #YouTubeAsksObama. You can watch the interview below, starting today at 2pm Pacific time:

You might be asking yourself why the most powerful man in the world is sitting down with a person who makes cupcake and cute hair tutorials. I’m not a fortune-teller, but this interview probably won’t be a 21st century Frost-Nixon.

The youths of America are key to Obama’s signature laws. His health care legislation, the Affordable Care Act, was dependent on the fresh young bodies of millions of young Americans buying health insurance, which subsidized lower costs for older Americans. Hence, it’s why he sat down with Funny or Die’s “Between Two Ferns” for a comedy skit, which ended up driving millions of views to the healthcare.gov website.

His next plan will be free community college for the entire country. This is necessary for Obama to help close the high-tech skills gap.
