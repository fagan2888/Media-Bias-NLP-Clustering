Development organizations in Africa, in particular, receive billions of dollars each year to oversee (often well-meaning and occasionally successful) programs designed to make \u201clife at home\u201d better for Africans\u2014whether through running farms in Rwanda, educating teens in Tanzania, or supporting whole Millennium Villages (at a cost of $12,000 per household). A half-million more African migrants would create more than a billion dollars in additional exports for Africa per year. One could go further and argue that if Africans in one particular state or region migrate or want to migrate, then development in that area hasn\u2019t worked. In his 2007 paper, \u201cKeeping Them in Their Place: the ambivalent relationship between development and migration in Africa,\u201d the International Migration Institute\u2019s Oliver Bakewell wrote that \u201cfrom its earliest roots, development practice has commonly seen a reduction in migration as either an (implicit or explicit) aim of intervention or an indicator of a programme\u2019s success.\u201d Migration, then, is considered inversely proportional to success in African development. But a fascinating new paper from the World Bank turns this logic on its head. \u201cDoes Migration Foster Exports?\u00ad\u201d has a title with an unnecessary question mark. According to the authors, migration does indeed foster exports in Africa, and in numbers large enough that they should catch the attention of development and policy leaders worldwide. Their findings \u201csuggest that one additional migrant creates about 2,100 dollars a year in additional exports for his country of origin.\u201d\n\nAfrican Migrants in the World in 2010 Using that estimation, a half-million more African migrants dispersing throughout the world\u2014a number equivalent to less than 1/100th of a percent of the world\u2019s population\u2014would create more than a billion dollars in additional exports for Africa, per year. The $2,100 is in addition to the dramatically increased salaries African migrants can expect from moving to countries with stronger economies. It\u2019s also in addition to the remittances they send home. And it takes into account that half of all African migrants don\u2019t even leave the continent. With the number of African migrants in the world having doubled since 1980 to more than 30 million, and given Africa\u2019s expected population boom in the coming decades, the impact Africans have from a distance on their home-country economies is only set to grow. Remittances and Other Resource Flows to Africa, 1999-2010 \u201cMigrant populations play a significant role in opening markets for African exports by enforcing rules and contracts, and by making products better known in foreign markets,\u201d Raju Jan Singh, the paper\u2019s lead author, tells me. African countries tend to have weak legal institutions and therefore loose enforcement of the rule of law, and African migrants living abroad play an especially important role in addressing these challenges. The migrants create an \u201cenforcement channel,\u201d the authors write\u2014settling disputes between traders and imposing informal sanctions through the diaspora community\u2014and that channel grows \u201cin proportion to the weakness of institutions in exporting countries.\u201d If, for instance, a shop owner in the United Kingdom wants to purchase and resell Ghanaian fabrics, a member of the Ghanaian diaspora living in London can help ensure\u2014if not by law then by the threat of shame in her native community\u2014that the dealer doesn\u2019t get ripped off by sellers from an unfamiliar culture a continent away. In the case of a country with weaker institutions, such as Liberia or Cameroon, migrants abroad play an even bigger role in these kinds of transactions.\n\nAfrican migrants also facilitate information-sharing. They move to places where locals may be wary of buying products made in their native countries, and make these products seem less risky to import. Ethiopian food, for example, has become popular in certain U.S. cities, and you\u2019ll even find some Americans, especially gluten-free folks, making their own injera, a spongy flatbread made from a grain called teff that is native to the highlands of Ethiopia and Eritrea. That simply wouldn\u2019t have happened without a thriving Ethiopian diaspora living abroad and sharing their delicious foods with their new neighbors. \u201cThe implication is that migration is positive for the home country,\u201d says Singh, \u201cnot only through remittances, but also by opening the export markets, which sort of dampens the \u2018brain drain\u2019 story.\u201d Indeed, the loss of human capital is often cited as an argument against the concept of migration as a form of development. When educated people move away from poor countries in large numbers, the thinking goes, those countries struggle without their best and brightest. But the Center for Global Development\u2019s Michael Clemens has shown that rather than creating a void, African health professionals leaving home may actually encourage more people to attempt to duplicate their success by becoming health professionals themselves. And Columbia\u2019s Jagdish Bhagwati put it well when he noted that the \u201c\u2018brain\u2019 is not a static concept. Trapped in Kinshasa, under appalling conditions, the brain will drain away in less time than it takes to get to New York.\u201d Major Destination Countries for Emigrants From Africa, 2010 Back in 2007, Bakewell argued that international development has been shaped by one of the nastier elements of colonialism, which depended heavily on controlling the movement of locals\u2014from the theft of humans for slavery to forced labor on African plantations to apartheid-era Bantustans\u2014for the benefit of European migrants to Africa.\n\nIn a study for the Overseas Development Institute, Priya Deshingkar and Sven Grimm made a similar argument. \u201cImplicit in many agricultural or rural development policies in Africa is the aim of controlling population movements,\u201d they wrote. \u201cPolicymakers have tended to perceive migration largely as a problem, posing a threat to social and economic stability, and have therefore tried to control it, rather than viewing it as an important livelihood option for the poor.\u201d Ethiopian food simply wouldn't be popular without a thriving Ethiopian diaspora living abroad. When development aims to improve \u201chome,\u201d it is presumed that a better life at home is always the goal for the beneficiaries. We\u2019re so clear about wanting to develop countries that we call the places we\u2019re helping \u201cdeveloping countries.\u201d The goal is to develop a place where people happen to live, rather than to develop people, wherever they live. The trouble with development work that encourages migrants to stay home, or return home, wrote Bakewell, \u201cis that it assumes that all the actors involved have a common view of the \u2018good\u2019 ends to which the process leads them. It operates on the assumption that the normal and desirable state for human beings is to be sedentary.\u201d If improving only \u201chome\u201d is the goal, then, \u201cIt is impossible simply to bring migration into development (such as \u2018inserting migration into the Millennium Development Goals\u2019) without raising fundamental questions about the nature of development and how it is put into practice. These include asking about the conception of the good life in mainstream development goals; the appropriateness of models of development based on the nation state; and, the inherent paternalism of mainstream development practice.\u201d For the beneficiaries of development initiatives, Bakewell added, these \u201cactivities may be trying to maintain a way of life which they would love the chance to abandon.\u201d These days, however, a number of economists are making the case for looser borders as a means of reducing poverty\u2014arguing that development is about people, not places. And the World Bank\u2019s new study appears to support this assertion. The report\u2019s authors found that the farther migrants move, and the more ethnically different their new home from their old home (both are homes, by the way), the more exports they help create for their country of origin.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A new study reveals that the farther African migrants move, the more they increase exports in their home countries.", "author": "Shaun Raviv", "og": {"site_name": "The Atlantic", "description": "A new study reveals that the farther African migrants move, the more they increase exports in their home countries.", "title": "Why 'Brain Drain' Can Actually Benefit African Countries", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2014/02/RTX7IQO/lead_large.jpg", "url": "http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/02/why-brain-drain-can-actually-benefit-african-countries/283750/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "theatlantic.com", "site": "@theatlantic", "card": "summary"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "p": {"domain_verify": "68e1a0361a557708fefc992f3309ed70"}, "fb": {"admins": "577048155,17301937", "page_id": 29259828486, "app_id": 100770816677686}, "keywords": "The Atlantic, The Atlantic Magazine, TheAtlantic.com, Atlantic, news, opinion, breaking news, analysis, commentary, business, politics, culture, international, science, technology, national and life", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, width=device-width, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "African countries tend to have weak legal institutions and therefore loose enforcement of the rule of law, and African migrants living abroad play an especially important role in addressing these challenges.\nThe $2,100 is in addition to the dramatically increased salaries African migrants can expect from moving to countries with stronger economies.\nAnd it takes into account that half of all African migrants don\u2019t even leave the continent.\nA half-million more African migrants would create more than a billion dollars in additional exports for Africa per year.\nAfrican migrants also facilitate information-sharing."}
