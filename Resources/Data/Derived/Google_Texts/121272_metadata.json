He faces two-term incumbent Gov. Peter Shumlin, a Putney Democrat.\n\nBut in order to complete his trip, the state\u2019s voters will have to punch Milne\u2019s ticket on Nov. 4. So Milne is traveling throughout the state stumping for as many votes as he can.\n\nHe told the Addison Independent during a recent interview that he is enjoying his campaign experience, though he acknowledged there have been some bumps along the way.\n\nHis mother, former state representative and Milne Travel founder Marion Milne, died this past August.\n\nThe Daily Show with John Stewart and The Late Show with David Letterman both rebroadcast his gaffe from a candidates\u2019 debate last week when he misspoke about having been born in Vermont and had to clarify he was born in Brooklyn.\n\nDuring his travels, he is invariably approached by a lot of Vermonters, some of whom give him high marks and encouragement, and others who give him some grief.\n\n\u201cI like to compare it to the old Wide World of Sports intro,\u201d he said, referring to the ABC Sports program that showed footage accompanied by the narrative, \u201cThe thrill of victory and the agony of defeat.\u201d He said he can experience those divergent feelings numerous times during the course of a campaign day.\n\n\u201cI have promised people that I am going to listen before I act,\u201d Milne said. \u201cI\u2019m not talking in sound bites.\u201d\n\nMilne, 55, said the people he\u2019s been meeting have expressed a lot of concerns about how the state is being run, particularly as it relates to health care policy, growing property taxes, education quality and the business climate.\n\nMilne recently made some waves with his release of an \u201ceducation and business plan.\u201d That plan calls for, among other things:\n\n\u2022 Capping Vermont\u2019s statewide education property tax rate for the next two years, during which time the administration and Legislature would devise a new system for funding education.\n\n\u2022 Reducing Vermont\u2019s average per-pupil spending rate from its current level of around $17,500, to the national level of around $12,000. Milne said this would free up tuition money for the state\u2019s roughly 7,000 annual high school graduates to attend the Vermont State College System.\n\n\u2022 Consolidating the state\u2019s 46 supervisory unions into around 15 \u201cregional education districts,\u201d or REDs, which Milne believes would be an administrative cost-saver to help fund the college scholarships. He stressed individual school districts within those REDs would still be able to maintain higher per-pupil spending rates if they chose to do so, according to Milne, who is also an advocate for expanded public school choice in Vermont.\n\nThe plan has drawn criticism from the Shumlin camp.\n\nShumlin campaign spokesman Scott Coriell said Milne\u2019s plan would \u201cblow a $42 million hole in Vermont\u2019s education system, according to the Joint Fiscal Office.\u201d\n\nMilne disputed his opponent\u2019s assessment. He said there is a $43 million broad-based tax increase for education \u201calready cooked into the books for next year.\u201d Milne considers property taxes to be a broad-based tax during this post-Brigham decision era of education funding.\n\nIn 2005, 61 percent of the state\u2019s education system was funded by property taxes, according to Milne. That percentage has now gone up to 69 percent of the $1.8 billion being spent, he said.\n\n\u201cThe governor and the Legislature don\u2019t want to do the hard work,\u201d Milne said of the inability thus far to remedy the situation.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a two-year gimmick,\u201d Milne said of his plan. \u201cWhat I believe \u2026 is if we are successful with this, it\u2019ll perhaps be a fix for our demographic trend.\u201d\n\nThat trend, Milne noted, has seen many Vermont high school graduates leave for better economic opportunities in other states.\n\n\u201cIf people around the country and the world realize that Vermont is a place you can go as a middle-income family and your children can go to college there for free, I think it\u2019s going to attract the people who were attracted here 100 years ago \u2014 that immigration boom,\u201d Milne said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an opportunity to energize our economy with an innovative idea, and we are a small enough state where we can do this,\u201d he added.\n\nHEALTH CARE DEBATE\n\nBut the state should not proceed along its current path to a single-payer health care system, according to Milne. He said Shumlin and the Democrat-controlled Legislature are leading the state down a health care path that is fraught with uncertainty. The Shumlin administration has yet to release details on how it proposes to fund a single-payer system, Milne noted.\n\n\u201cPeople are concerned we are doubling-down on Peter Shumlin\u2019s reckless experiment with our health care system,\u201d Milne said. \u201cTo me, when you sift through what people are saying, the reason it is a big topic is because of the uncertainty people are seeing.\u201d\n\nMilne said 25 percent to 35 percent of the costs of private health insurance are associated with a cost-shift due to the underfunding of the federal Medicaid and Medicare programs.\n\nInstead of proceeding with single payer, Milne believes Vermont should allow the technology firm Optum to further develop the Vermont Health Connect website. That website was shut down several weeks ago amid some technical issues, providing an obstacle for those trying to register for benefits through the federally mandated health care exchange.\n\n\u201cIf Optum doesn\u2019t work, then we have a disaster and need to figure out what to do,\u201d Milne said. \u201cIn the short-term, we have a triage situation \u2014 are we going to deal with the Optum site and have a cost-benefit analysis, or are we going to have a real disaster that we\u2019re going to have to deal with.\u201d\n\nMilne believes it was a mistake for the Legislature to advocate for a single-payer system.\n\n\u201cWe should have been content with the (federal) Affordable Care Act,\u201d Milne said. \u201cWe really just put the (ACA) on steroids. The premise on how single-payer was going to revitalize our economy was foolish.\u201d\n\nSingle-payer advocates have in part argued that such a system would finally free businesses from having to offer health insurance benefits. Milne believes having such a system in place would attract low-paying jobs and steer away high-paying jobs. Late Wednesday Milne offered his plan for spurring economic growth in Vermont\n\nOther issues Milne discussed during the interview with the Independent included:\n\n\u2022 Big government. Milne believes Vermont\u2019s governmental bureaucracy is too big for a state of 640,000 residents.\n\n\u201cWe have the population of a medium-sized city and the governmental complexity of a small European country,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe need to reorganize state government so it can be more efficient.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Planning. Milne said the state needs to adopt more of a long-term view on economic planning, while at the same time extending short-term incentives to those willing to establish businesses in the Green Mountain State.\n\n\u2022 The Democrats\u2019 overwhelming numerical superiority in the General Assembly and executive branch.\n\n\u201cOne-party rule is not good for anyone,\u201d he said.\n\nReporter John Flowers is at [email protected]", "article_metadata": {"description": "Vermont's only twice-weekly newspaper, serving the 23 towns of Addison County"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe039a\"", "article_summary": "\u201cPeople are concerned we are doubling-down on Peter Shumlin\u2019s reckless experiment with our health care system,\u201d Milne said.\nHEALTH CARE DEBATEBut the state should not proceed along its current path to a single-payer health care system, according to Milne.\nSCOTT MILNEMIDDLEBURY \u2014 As the CEO of Milne Travel, Republican Scott Milne has sent many people to exotic locations throughout the world.\nThe Shumlin administration has yet to release details on how it proposes to fund a single-payer system, Milne noted.\nInstead of proceeding with single payer, Milne believes Vermont should allow the technology firm Optum to further develop the Vermont Health Connect website."}
