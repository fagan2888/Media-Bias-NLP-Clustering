Now, several conservative organizations are asking for the same opportunity.\n\n\u201cConservatives cannot sit back and allow liberals to have sole voice with the Federal Reserve System,\u201d says @Lonegan\n\nTwenty representatives from more than a dozen conservative groups hand-delivered their request to the Federal Reserve last week seeking a meeting with Yellen.\n\nThe groups, led by American Principles in Action, include Americans for Tax Reform, the Jack Kemp Foundation and Citizens for Limited Government.\n\nThe letter states that \u201cthought leaders from the center-right\u201d deserve the same opportunity because \u201cthe left by no means has a monopoly on concern for unemployment and wage stagnation.\u201d\n\nSteve Lonegan, director of monetary policy at American Principles in Action, told The Daily Signal:\n\nMonetary policy is at the root of economic stability, critical for assuring equitable prosperity for all Americans. Conservatives are committed to building a sound economy where everyone, rich and poor, can grow and prosper. The left has met with Janet Yellen in an effort to influence monetary policy. Conservatives cannot sit back and allow liberals to have sole voice with the Federal Reserve System. Conservatives have the science, history, facts and philosophy for advancing good money that assures equitable prosperity for all Americans.\n\nIn November, Yellen met with representatives from several left-leaning groups, including The Center for Popular Democracy, a group that, according to its website, works with \u201chigh-impact base-building organizations, organizing alliances and progressive unions\u201d to advance a \u201cpro-worker, pro-immigrant, racial and economic justice agenda.\u201d\n\nAdy Barkan, an attorney with the center, told the Associated Press that she thought Yellen and other Fed officials \u201clistened.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was a very good conversation,\u201d said Barkan. \u201cThey listened very intently, and they asked meaningful follow-up questions.\u201d\n\nAccording to The Daily Caller, the closed-door meeting was a source of frustration for conservatives because \u201cthe press was shut out of the meeting and no transcript made available.\u201d\n\nAccording to Bloomberg, the Nov. 14 meeting also included Fed governors Stanley Fischer, Jerome Powell and Lael Brainard.\n\nThe letter from the conservative groups argues that they deserve a similar meeting because \u201can evenhanded insight on achieving our shared goal of job creation and economic mobility would facilitate steps toward realization of this mutual objective.\u201d\n\nYou can read the full letter here.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "On Dec. 9, a letter to Yellen from 20 representatives from more than a dozen conservative groups was hand-delivered to the Federal Reserve.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "On Dec. 9, a letter to Yellen from 20 representatives from more than a dozen conservative groups was hand-delivered to the Federal Reserve.", "title": "\u2018Conservatives Cannot Sit Back\u2019: Coalition Wants to Meet With Fed Chair Janet Yellen", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/epalive284435.jpg", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1Gp33nL"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "On Dec. 9, a letter to Yellen from 20 representatives from more than a dozen conservative groups was hand-delivered to the Federal Reserve.", "creator": "@dailysignal", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/epalive284435.jpg"}, "title": "\u2018Conservatives Cannot Sit Back\u2019: Coalition Wants to Meet With Fed Chair Janet Yellen", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Economy", "tag": "monetary policy", "published_time": "2014-12-17T09:55:24+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Janet Yellen, Federal Reserve, the fed, American Principles in Action, Americans for Tax Reform, the Jack Kemp Foundation, Citizens for Limited Government, Steve Lonegan, Grover Norquist"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0217\"", "article_summary": "Federal Reserve chairwoman Janet Yellen met with several left-leaning groups last month to discuss monetary policy.\nThe left has met with Janet Yellen in an effort to influence monetary policy.\nConservatives cannot sit back and allow liberals to have sole voice with the Federal Reserve System.\nConservatives have the science, history, facts and philosophy for advancing good money that assures equitable prosperity for all Americans.\nThe groups, led by American Principles in Action, include Americans for Tax Reform, the Jack Kemp Foundation and Citizens for Limited Government."}
