His pick-six, in which he stepped right in front of Andre Caldwell for the catch, was called back because of an offsides penalty on Bradley Roby. But for camp, it counted.\n\n\u201cThey made more plays on the ball today than they\u2019ve been making,\u201d Kubiak said of the defense. \u201cThe thing we have to eliminate defensively is we were having some penalties \u2014 some penalties that extended some drives for the offense today.\u201d\n\nTalib\u2019s performance though was just a continuation of the strong showing he\u2019s had throughout camp.\n\n\u201cThe difference in this league between a good corner and a great corner are guys who have ball skills,\u201d Kubiak said. \u201cA lot of guys can cover, but when the ball is there, can you make the play on the ball? Can you make the pick? Can you take it the other way? As an offensive guy, attacking corners that you know don\u2019t have ball skills, you\u2019re not afraid. That\u2019s what separates him.\u201d\n\nThe Broncos strapped on the pads Saturday, but a handful of veterans only observed from the sideline.\n\nReceiver Emmanuel Sanders, cornerback Chris Harris and safety David Bruton are all dealing with minor leg soreness and did not participate. They were joined on the sideline by inside linebacker Steve Johnson (sprained knee), outside linebacker Lerentee McCray (groin), defensive tackle Marvin Austin (groin), offensive tackle Michael Schofield (back), safety Ross Madison (groin) and cornerback Curtis Marsh (quadriceps).\n\nDefensive lineman Derek Wolfe, who is in the protocol after suffering a concussion in Thursday\u2019s practice, watched from the sideline.\n\nThe Broncos opened practice with walk-throughs for the offensive lines. Ty Sambrailo, Louis Vasquez, Matt Paradis, Max Garcia and Ryan Harris again took reps with the first unit.\n\nThe team returns Sunday for both a morning workout open to fans (9:30 a.m.-11:30 a.m.) and an afternoon walk-though. Manning will be back from Canton in time for the afternoon walk-through, but Kubiak said he plans to rest him a number of veterans.\n\nFootnotes: Kubiak said C.J. Anderson \u201cgot a little shoulder nick\u201d and, at Kubiak\u2019s request, stopped early. \u2026 Linebacker Danny Trevathan took team reps, continuing his slow return back to full strength following knee surgery in January. \u2026 Kayvon Webster participated early but has been bothered by rib soreness on his right side, so coaches had him stop.\n\nNicki Jhabvala: njhabvala@denverpost.com or twitter.com/nickijhabvala\n\nT.D.\u2019s take. Broncos Ring of Famer and all-time leading rusher Terrell Davis attended practice Saturday as an analyst with the NFL Network. He spoke to general manager John Elway, his former quarterback. He spoke to wide receiver Demaryius Thomas. And he watched practice alongside the players and coaches as Manning showed off his mobility in Kubiak\u2019s offense.\n\nAfterward, Davis gave his thoughts on the new-look Broncos, and whether he thinks Kubiak\u2019s system will work.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of questions about whether Peyton Manning can run this offense,\u201d Davis said. \u201cI\u2019m like, he\u2019s Peyton Manning \u2014 why wouldn\u2019t he be able to run this offense? What you\u2019re going to do is just take what he does best. Those plays, you\u2019re going to put them into the game plan. The ones he doesn\u2019t do well, you take them out.\u201d\n\nDavis believes Manning may play a role similar to Elway\u2019s in the late 1990s, when Kubiak was his offensive coordinator. Although the Broncos had a more balanced attack then, it did not mean a lesser role for the QB.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think John took a lesser role when he was our quarterback here,\u201d Davis said. \u201cIt\u2019s a different role. You\u2019re just not asked to do what you did in the past, and that is to throw it 45, 50 times a game.\n\n\u201c(Manning is) still capable of throwing it 50, 40 times a game. I don\u2019t think they\u2019re going to ask him to do it, but I don\u2019t see it like him taking a lesser role.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Peyton Manning shows mobility, defense stars at Broncos camp", "title": "Peyton Manning shows mobility, defense stars at Broncos camp", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/08/08/peyton-manning-shows-mobility-defense-stars-at-broncos-camp/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150808_101327_denver-broncos.jpg", "height": 339}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150808_101327_denver-broncos.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-08-08T10:04:15+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-22T08:48:00+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Standing on the sideline for Day 8 of Broncos training camp, Chesney got a front-row view of 39-year-old Peyton Manning\u2019s oft-scrutinized mobility.\nBroncos Ring of Famer and all-time leading rusher Terrell Davis attended practice Saturday as an analyst with the NFL Network.\n\u201cThe difference in this league between a good corner and a great corner are guys who have ball skills,\u201d Kubiak said.\nThe defense had arguably its finest day yet in camp, with cornerback Aqib Talib leading the way.\nAnd he watched practice alongside the players and coaches as Manning showed off his mobility in Kubiak\u2019s offense."}
