A steady flow of customers thumbed their way through the stacks, arranged in plywood bins against a backdrop of vibrant orange walls.\n\nShop owner Steve Haynes visited with customers, offering to carry their armloads of vinyl to the front counter as they continued to shop. His wife, Verna, eventually joined him and took a seat behind the till.\n\nThe Anchorage couple\u2019s new business is part of an industry hit hard by the digital age in the late 1990s. But in the last two years, the music industry reportedly began to recover, with vinyl sales included. In 2012 sales were up for first time since 1999, according to the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry, which analyzes the global market.\n\nSteve and Verna said they\u2019ve both seen music shops in Anchorage struggle. When asked about the outlook of their business they were not overly optimistic.\n\n\u201cSo vinyl sales are up? And they are, but in the big scheme of things, when you\u2019re looking at the music industry as a whole record sales are a very small fraction,\u201d Steve said.\n\nBut the couple said their business, which opened its doors in early December, is doing better than either of them imagined. And so far, they\u2019ve done it without any paid advertising, counting solely on word of mouth and Facebook.\n\n\u201cWe make ends meet and we get rent paid, but so far there hasn\u2019t been a ton of money in this,\u201d Steve said.\n\nCustomers of all ages visit the shop, \u201cyoung-adult and up,\u201d they said.\n\nA middle-aged couple with grown children of their own, they said it\u2019s too early to call their new business a \u201cretirement plan\u201d or even to predict how long they\u2019ll be able to keep the doors open. They didn\u2019t get into it \u201cto become millionaires,\u201d Verna said, and right now they just want to be able to keep the store open.\n\nFor them, Verna said, the store is more of a labor of love.\n\n\u201cMusic is fun,\u201d Verna said, as she sat behind the till. \u201cWe are not record snobs. We don\u2019t care who comes in, they could be new to collecting vinyls or have complete records collections. We just want to share the music.\u201d\n\nThe shop sells the classics \u2014 The Beatles, The Doors, The Police, Johnny Cash \u2014 but they also sell an occasional Alaska vinyl, more recent artists like Blink 182 and Daft Punk, and movie soundtracks.\n\nSteve said he has several different avenues for finding records, but he didn\u2019t want to reveal his secrets. His personal collection includes about 17,000 records, many of which have ended up in the store\u2019s inventory. Opening the shop is part of his record purge to make space for new vinyl at home.\n\nSteve also orders a smaller variety of new music.\n\n\u201cHim and I collect records very differently,\u201d Verna said. \u201cI have this small little stack, and those are what I like and I can listen to them over and over again. He actually has record collections, though. I don\u2019t chase records. And I don\u2019t need to collect things just to have them. I have done that before.\u201d\n\nA majority of the records Steve sells are in good condition. A few might be a little dusty, but Steve and Verna offer to clean them before bands, such as The Who, walk out the door in the arms of a new owner.\n\n\u201cThe condition is the No. 1 thing I look at,\u201d Steve said. \u201cThe next thing I look at is rarity. If the record is dinged up, but there was only a couple hundred copies, it\u2019s worth more and I might buy it.\u201d\n\nSteve got back into the record-collecting business for the same reason many have in the last few years. It\u2019s the classic tale of going digital, only to lose all your music because of a computer crash, which happened to Steve about six years ago, he said.\n\n\u201cWhen that happened I pulled out my old CDs and a lot of them were trashed from being in the car or whatever, so I started thinking about vinyl again,\u201d Steve said.\n\nSteve received a phone call from a family member, which resulted in the start of his collection, thanks to some garage sale vinyl.\n\nSteve has a sense of connection with his records, making \u201cObsession Records\u201d all the more fitting as a business name. Verna chuckled at the thought of some of his reactions when it came time to say goodbye to his records.\n\nThere is still work to be done on the shop. They\u2019d like to add posters to the walls and make a space for local musicians to play, but it\u2019s still a work in progress, they said.\n\nRight now, shops hours are limited. They have day jobs and only operate the store from 5 to 8 p.m. during the week, with longer hours on the weekends.\n\nBy the end of the interview, the Haynes had listened to both sides of the \u201cBrothers\u201d album and a St. Paul and the Broken Bones record \u2014 which Steve told a customer he\u2019d recently discovered. It has a Motown sound to it and is the kind of music that makes people move.\n\n\u201cMusic just feels good,\u201d Verna said. \u201cIt feels really good and it\u2019s fun. And I don\u2019t want to just leave these piled up at home. We really want to share it because its music and you should share music.\u201d\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Alaska Dispatch News, http://www.adn.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "On a dark January evening, the Black Keys' album \"Brother\" spun on a turntable inside the newly established Obsession Records shop off Tudor Road in Anchorage.
