The presenter named seismic shifts: outcomes-based measurement for reimbursement, integration of physical and mental health services and care coordination, using a team approach to assist patients in getting services outside the usual purview of healthcare such as food assistance, housing assistance and help with medications. I raised my hand and offered the services of the people in that room to teach\u2014for a small fee\u2014the mainstream healthcare providers how to do it. The room erupted in laughter and applause, but I wasn\u2019t joking. The nonprofit sector has been at the forefront of all of those \u201crevolutionary\u201d ideas for years. This type of integration is in the DNA of most community-based organizations. I am still waiting for that call.\n\nOn January 1, 2014, there was much wailing and gnashing of teeth because of the rollout of the ACA\u2019s most famous provision: the individual coverage mandate. That was the primary subject of most stories about the ACA, and people roundly praised it or criticized it based solely on that single provision. But the reach of the ACA had begun long before that, with several wonky-sounding provisions that only those in the healthcare world paid attention to. And yet, it is those less newsworthy provisions that have made the biggest impact on turning the healthcare world around and viewing healthcare and payment policy through a completely new lens. Or, at least, new to the healthcare system status quo. But to some outside mainstream healthcare, this seismic shift was simply business as usual. Those in the world of free and charitable clinics simply saw their way of doing business categorized as \u201crevolutionary\u201d and \u201cgame changing.\u201d\n\nFree and charitable clinics (FCCs) are a community\u2019s response to a community need. There is no centralized bureaucracy operating the clinics, and most work independent of hospital systems, governments or large governing bodies. Unlike Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs), FCCs rarely receive government funding. Most often do not take insurance of any kind (including Medicaid) and provide services to the uninsured or underinsured completely free or for a modest fee (which is waived if the patient cannot pay). According to the National Association of Free Clinics, there are approximately 1200 FCCs in the country. In my own state of Illinois, there are at least 50 clinics. Because of the variety and the geographic focus of the individual and unique place-centered services they provide, trying to put an exact number on how many operate is like trying to nail Jell-O to the wall. But the one thing that unites free and charitable clinics is the way they provide services designed to meet the needs of their community, rather than evaluating the worth of a program using cost as the deciding factor.\n\nOne of the lesser-known provisions of the ACA is healthcare workforce development. The U.S. is fast approaching shortages in some key areas\u2014notably, nursing and primary care. This impending shortage is somewhat ironic, in that as the ACA gives more people access to regular primary care, the pool of providers available to care for them is shrinking. The ACA invests in programs to stem this shortfall, including nurse practitioner programs, nursing programs and medical student programs. As with most healthcare training, a rotation of clinicals is an integral part of the training. Particularly with nurse practitioner students, there is a huge shortfall in available spots because of the perception that having students will slow the provider down. In the current \u201cproduction\u2013for\u2013pay\u201d environment, most potential preceptors are not willing to risk the loss in pay that slower production may bring.\n\nFree and charitable clinics, however, have stepped in to fill some of the need. The Family Health Partnership Clinic in Crystal Lake, Illinois, has a collaborative program with Rush University\u2019s School of Nursing to bring NP students into the clinic for their clinical hours. \u201cThis environment is ideal for NP students,\u201d says Dr. Martha Siomos, the preceptor at the Clinic, who brings between two and four students each semester. \u201cNot only are they getting a high quality/high touch clinical experience, it presents issues they would never have encountered in a regular practice, and it opens their eyes to the satisfaction of working in a community based clinic.\u201d\n\nCommunityHealth, located in the West Town and Englewood neighborhoods of Chicago, is the largest free clinic in Illinois (and in the country) and provides similar opportunities for medical schools and residency training programs to learn how to care for the uninsured. \u201cThe work is challenging,\u201d notes Judith Haasis, Executive Director. \u201cBut this next generation of physicians quickly develops the insight and skills required to truly help our vulnerable patient population. What can I do for the asthmatic patient with bronchitis whose apartment is cold, damp, and covered in mold? How can I convince the mother of three who feels isolated and is struggling with depression to join a support group? Where can the homeless patient keep his insulin refrigerated?\u201d\n\nThese questions form the very basis of the ACA\u2019s aim to drive providers into Coordinated Care Entities (CCEs). These networks, according to the ACA, should provide patients with a continuous stream of care that doesn\u2019t stop at the hospital door. It requires hospitals and healthcare systems to form relationships with other community organizations so that the holistic needs of the patients can be addressed, not just the immediate physical health care needs. The ACA recognizes that patients are more than just their disease states; their health is impacted by where they live, how they obtain (or not) their food, and other socioeconomic situations including drug/alcohol abuse, domestic violence, and mental health.\n\nMost free and charitable clinics have always operated this way. In Normal, Illinois, Community Health Care Clinic\u2019s executive director is a social worker who understands that health is not simply the \u201cabsence of disease\u201d\u2014it relates to everything in the patients\u2019 world that impacts them. Recently, Community Health Care Clinic has taken that model to a new level. Partnering with the local homeless organization, the clinic brought its mobile health van to an encampment where many homeless people were living in tents and to the local homeless shelter. Most of them had never been to the clinic\u2019s physical building, but took advantage of the proximity of the health van to get initial treatment for chronic and acute conditions as well as look at alternative housing options. Social workers were available to assess and refer those who were in need of further mental health and other community services. \u201cIt was a terrific opportunity to reach those who we thought were unreachable by bringing a one stop shop to them where they were and when they needed it,\u201d noted Angie McLaughlin, Clinic Executive Director. \u201cWe have always been strong partners with the homeless agency, and this was a way that we each could deliver better services to a small community in need.\u201d These two organizations don\u2019t call their partnership a \u201ccoordinated care entity\u201d; they simply call it business as usual.\n\nThese three clinics are not going the extra mile because of the promise of extra reimbursement\u2014in fact, none of these programs are moneymakers\u2014but because it is part of the holistic philosophy embraced by free and charitable clinics around the country. In addition, high-touch healthcare has proved to deliver better outcomes for patients.\n\nBecause of the heavy reliance on foundation grants and funding, free and charitable clinics and other nonprofit organizations exist in a world where outcomes-based measurements are critical. The VNA Foundation in Chicago, a strong funder of healthcare to the underserved, stresses a need for potential grantees to be able to show improvement in health status, rather than simply an increase in census numbers. An entire area of their website is dedicated to outcomes-based measurements, with grantee examples highlighted to assist others with measuring the value of the services they deliver.\n\nThat attention to outcomes has paid off. The Family Health Partnership Clinic (FHPC) can show that their patients with diabetes actually have A1cs (a measure of blood sugar control) that are lower than that of diabetic patients who have regular private insurance. FHPC does regular chart reviews and audits and looks at population health to determine how patients are doing as a whole. Few private offices are able to provide that kind of data. They can report how many diabetic patients they have, but they rarely look at the actual outcomes of the patients as a population.\n\nThe shift to outcome-based measurements as a condition for reimbursement and coordinated care is integral to the structure of the ACA, and is cited as one of the seismic shifts, yet FCCs have been involved in this type of quality review for years. \u201cIt never ceases to amaze me at how creative and innovative free and charitable clinics are,\u201d notes Leslie Ramyk, executive director of the Illinois Association of Free and Charitable Clinics. \u201cSo many of the things that FCCs are already doing\u2014like integrated mental health care in the clinic\u2014are only now being looked at by the larger healthcare systems.\u201d\n\nIn many ways, the innovative work and extremely low budgets of FCCs reminds me of the joke about how Ginger Rogers danced: She had to do everything Fred Astaire did, but backwards and wearing heels.\n\nBut free and charitable clinic leaders rarely wear heels. They make it difficult to haul in donated exam tables.\n\nSuzanne Hoban is the executive director of the Family Health Partnership Clinic in Crystal Lake, Illinois.", "article_metadata": {"description": "In many ways, the innovative work and extremely low budgets of FCCs are reminiscent of the joke about Ginger Rogers: She had to do everything Fred Astaire did, but backwards and wearing heels.", "original-source": "https://nonprofitquarterly.org/2015/02/16/dancing-like-ginger-rogers-the-remarkable-work-of-free-and-charitable-clinics/", "og": {"site_name": "Non Profit News For Nonprofit Organizations | Nonprofit Quarterly", "description": "In many ways, the innovative work and extremely low budgets of FCCs are reminiscent of the joke about Ginger Rogers: She had to do everything Fred Astaire did, but backwards and wearing heels.", "title": "\u201cDancing Like Ginger Rogers\u201d: The Remarkable Work of Free and Charitable Clinics", "url": "https://nonprofitquarterly.org/2015/02/16/dancing-like-ginger-rogers-the-remarkable-work-of-free-and-charitable-clinics/", "image": "https://nonprofitquarterly.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/56/files/2015/02/Ginger-Rogers.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@npquarterly", "card": "summary"}, "syndication-source": "https://nonprofitquarterly.org/2015/02/16/dancing-like-ginger-rogers-the-remarkable-work-of-free-and-charitable-clinics/", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Management, community health center, Financial Management, Organizational Design"}, "article_summary": "\u201cIt never ceases to amaze me at how creative and innovative free and charitable clinics are,\u201d notes Leslie Ramyk, executive director of the Illinois Association of Free and Charitable Clinics.\nThose in the world of free and charitable clinics simply saw their way of doing business categorized as \u201crevolutionary\u201d and \u201cgame changing.\u201dFree and charitable clinics (FCCs) are a community\u2019s response to a community need.\nAccording to the National Association of Free Clinics, there are approximately 1200 FCCs in the country.\nFree and charitable clinics, however, have stepped in to fill some of the need.\nMost free and charitable clinics have always operated this way."}
