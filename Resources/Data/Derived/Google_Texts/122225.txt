Councilman Jake Dickinson told the council at last night’s meeting that he was still looking into the matter of the new rate structure used by EPB and how it could impact the elderly and low income:



Dickinson does plan to address the issue after gathering information from the next two billing cycles.

Dr. Bharat Mody addressed the council in regard to the many local charities he supports. Dr. Mody says that the group is well on its way to achieving a two year, $250,000 fund raising plan for Children’s Day. Held on November 20th every year, Dr. Mody says that $100 bronze level sponsorships for Children’s Day are available, as well as higher level support opportunities. Money raised for Children’s Day goes to help Family Resource and Youth Services Centers at local schools as well as Feeding America’s Back-Pack program.

With the passage of the Affordable Care Act, Dr. Mody said that the focus of Community Medical Care has shifted somewhat from working adults to senior citizens.



Dr. Mody says the program also helps seniors with hearing aids and dentures. He also added that with the future of healthcare still being discussed on both a state and federal level, the focus of Community Medical Care may have to go turn back toward care of working adults.

The Glasgow City Council also approved accepting Montgomery Court as a city street. Betty Herbert and Summer Harper were both appointed to the Plaza Advisory Board.
