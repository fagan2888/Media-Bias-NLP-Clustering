In Obamacare's first year, a new report finds California extended coverage to more Hispanic kids than any other state.\n\nWhen it comes to expanding health coverage to Hispanic kids, California ranks No. 1.\n\nA new report from the Georgetown University Center for Children and Families looks at gains in health insurance for Hispanic kids in the first year of Obamacare.\n\nIt reveals that between 2013 and 2014, California extended coverage to 132,000 more Hispanic children. That gain was due primarily to the state\u2019s decision to make it easier for families to qualify for Medi-Cal.\n\nFatima Morales, a policy and outreach associate with the nonprofit advocacy group Children Now, said California has made the right moves.\n\n\u201cThere has been targeted outreach to Latino communities, and that\u2019s been really key,\" she said. \"Working with community-based organizations is so important.\u201d\n\nMorales pointed out that despite the gains, many Latino children are still uninsured.\n\n\"There\u2019s still about 323,000 uninsured kids in our state. And many of these children do currently qualify for Medi-Cal, but are unenrolled,\" she said.\n\nBeginning May 1, California will offer Medi-Cal to some 170,000 children of parents who are here illegally. The state will spend $40 million on that expansion this year, and more than three times that amount per year in subsequent years.", "article_metadata": {"description": "In Obamacare's first year, a new report finds California extended coverage to more Hispanic kids than any other state.", "author": "Kenny Goldberg", "og": {"site_name": "KPBS Public Media", "description": "In Obamacare's first year, a new report finds California extended coverage to more Hispanic kids than any other state.", "title": "California Ranks No. 1 On Gains In Health Coverage For Hispanic Kids", "url": "http://www.kpbs.org/news/2016/jan/15/california-ranks-1-new-report-gains-health-coverag/", "image": "https://kpbs.media.clients.ellingtoncms.com/img/news/tease/2016/01/14/1444158422_9eb9bb0578_o.jpg", "type": "article"}, "has_audio": 1, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "KPBS", "fb": {"app_id": 131056773055}, "apiKpbs": "162338 %##% California Ranks No. 1 On Gains In Health Coverage For Hispanic Kids", "keywords": "News, Health, Health Insurance", "verify-v1": "zHHWZpwcl/kpXf/ZbbmtRN41TWDeCfjQil8LGROx/LA=", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no,shrink-to-fit=no"}, "article_summary": "When it comes to expanding health coverage to Hispanic kids, California ranks No.\nIn Obamacare's first year, a new report finds California extended coverage to more Hispanic kids than any other state.\nIt reveals that between 2013 and 2014, California extended coverage to 132,000 more Hispanic children.\nA new report from the Georgetown University Center for Children and Families looks at gains in health insurance for Hispanic kids in the first year of Obamacare.\nBeginning May 1, California will offer Medi-Cal to some 170,000 children of parents who are here illegally."}
