Emma Coburn continued her European racing season of success on Saturday, running 4 minutes, 5.29 seconds in the women’s 1,500 meters at a small meet in Belgium.

She finished seventh in the event at the KBC Nacht Meet in Heusden — a track known for fast times. Next, Coburn and teammate Jenny Simpson — both of whom are University of Colorado Boulder graduates and now represent New Balance — will return from Europe this week for some training before going overseas once more for a final late-summer push.

Coburn set the American record in the steeplechase during the Glasgow Diamond League meet on July 12, running 9:11.42 to beat Simpson’s previous record, set in 2009 when she was still a student at CU Boulder. Coburn expects to compete in a few more Diamond League races before the season is out, and hopes to end it representing North America in the Continental Cup in Morocco in the steeplechase, she said in an interview last week.

Simpson, like her teammate, also spent the weekend going shorter to help boost her speed. She competed in an 800 at the Madrid IAAF World Challenge Meet in Spain, running 2:05.08, good for ninth place. Americans Charlene Lipsey was second in 2:00.91 and TaTavia Thomas was third in 2:00.95. At just .10 seconds short so far this season, Simpson is setting herself up to break the 1983 American record in the 1,500 set by fellow CU alumna Mary Slaney.
