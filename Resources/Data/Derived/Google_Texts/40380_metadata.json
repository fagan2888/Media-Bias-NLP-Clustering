Some of them see me at games and others have just found out online about CLU.\u201d\n\nJudd doesn\u2019t have scholarships to offer at the Division III level, but he can sell players on the chance to be trailblazers in CLU athletics history.\n\nJudd has already received a few commitments from local players. He doesn\u2019t want to reveal any names until their paperwork is processed.\n\n\u201cMy intention in the beginning is to hit the local area hard the first year or two. We are a volleyball power right here in Southern California. It\u2019s just a hotbed for it,\u201d Judd said. \u201cBut even though I haven\u2019t been able to watch kids out of state, I\u2019ve had kids emailing me from Hawaii and Arizona and even a kid from Massachusetts. It\u2019s great because it means the word is spreading.\u201d\n\nCLU announced men\u2019s volleyball would be the university\u2019s 21st varsity sport in early December. Judd was named the head coach a month later.\n\nJudd will continue to be an assistant for the CLU women\u2019s volleyball team. CLU women\u2019s head coach Kellee Roesel will be an assistant for the men\u2019s program.\n\nJudd and Roesel are working to put the finishing touches on the men\u2019s first schedule for the spring of 2016.\n\nCLU is one of only two Division III men\u2019s volleyball programs in California along with UC Santa Cruz. The Kingsmen will compete as an independent.\n\nCLU will be traveling East to participate in a few tournaments and is hosting two tournaments at the Gilbert Sports and Fitness Center. One of the tournaments at CLU will be in partnership with UC Santa Cruz.\n\nJudd said he\u2019s received a warm reception from other Division III coaches while on the recruiting trail.\n\n\u201cAt a tournament in Anaheim, we ran into some coaches from back East and they were very positive,\u201d Judd said. \u201cThe Nazareth (College) coach even offered to waive our entry fee if we can make it back to their tournament. The coaches have been very supportive of us starting a new program.\u201d\n\nJudd will finish this school year teaching science at Sequoia Middle School before joining the CLU faculty full time in June.\n\nAs the women\u2019s assistant coach, Judd has become well known for his creative team-building activities. He takes ideas from TV shows like \u201cSurvivor\u201d and \u201cThe Amazing Race\u201d or creates Olympic-style competition to help players pass the time during long tournament breaks.\n\nCLU athletic director Dan Kuntz took notice of Judd\u2019s meticulous execution, and gave him with an extra job title. Along with his volleyball coaching duties, Judd is the \u201cteam chemistry coordinator\u201d at CLU.\n\n\u201cHe loves everything we have done with the women\u2019s program and he wants me to help the other programs at CLU,\u201d Judd said. \u201cI have already helped the men\u2019s water polo team, and had other coaches call and ask about me to create something for them to build off-court chemistry.\u201d\n\nJudd is eager to devote all of his energy to CLU, and try to start the men\u2019s volleyball program off on the right foot.\n\n\u201cI am really excited about how things are going so far,\u201d Judd said. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of just a waiting game now to see how many kids we can get as they make their decisions about coming to CLU. Hopefully we will get quite a few.\u201d\n\nNEWS AND NOTES\n\nCal Lutheran junior outfielder Ramsey Abushahla had quite the weekend against Pomona-Pitzer.
