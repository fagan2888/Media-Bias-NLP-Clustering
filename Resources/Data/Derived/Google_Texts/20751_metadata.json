I have cherished the ideal of a democratic and free society in which all persons live together in harmony and with equal opportunities. It is an ideal which I hope to live for and achieve. But if needs be, it is an ideal for which I am prepared to die.\"\n\nThis is where it would help to read the entirety of Mandela's lengthy opening statement. He does say that he and his group, the African National Congress, had opposed the idea of black domination, but they were all fighting the reality of white domination. Taking that quote out of its context suggests that everybody in South Africa was at least a little bit wrong and that Mandela was some kind of raceless referee. But let us be clear: The problem with apartheid was white supremacy. He took up arms against that.\n\nNewt Gingrich, conservative talking head and former Republican Speaker of the House, lambasted fellow conservatives who have the gall to criticize Mandela's decision to fight an openly murderous apartheid regime with force. He demands that they say what they'd have done under those circumstances.\n\nAnother famous conservative, Bill O'Reilly, talked with former Republican presidential candidate Rick Santorum on the day of Mandela's death. They oversimplified him in another way. O'Reilly said, \"He was a communist. All right? But he was a great man. What he did for his people was stunning -- the sacrifices that he made.... He was a great man. But he was a communist.\"\n\nMandela addressed that allegation at his trial. His cooperation with communists, he said, didn't make him one. Just like the United States' alliance with Stalin against Hitler didn't make us red.\n\nIn agreeing with O'Reilly, Santorum gave Mandela a pass for his alleged communism because he was fighting such a great injustice. The big injustice today, Santorum said, is Obamacare.\n\nI thought it took time for the establishment to use a freedom fighter's legacy against the people he would have supported. But Santorum got to work before Mandela's body was cold.\n\nRead the opening statement from Mandela's trial and use the comments section to share your thoughts about the complexities of positions and how you think he'll be remembered.\n\n\n\nJarvis DeBerry can be reached at jdeberry@nola.com.
