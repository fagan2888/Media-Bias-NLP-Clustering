3-year-old girl to Ted Cruz: ‘The world is on fire?’

In the latest edition of “Ted Cruz, know your audience,” the Texas GOP senator was giving a speech on Sunday and while talking about the Obama administration’s foreign policy, proclaimed “the whole world’s on fire.”

Probably not a good idea when there are small children in the audience, especially if that small child is 3-year-old Julie Trant.

“The world is on fire?” the shocked little girl asked.

Cruz didn’t back down, affirming that yes, it is indeed one giant inferno.

“Yes! Your world is on fire,” he said. “But you know what? Your mommy’s here, and everyone’s here to make sure the world you grow up in is even better.”
