Just 28 seconds later, Darryl Bootland's eighth goal of the season put the Eagles up for good as goalie Clarke Saunders steered away all nine shots he faced in the third, with Utah playing the final 1:42 without a goalie in net.\n\nThe Eagles, who have won three straight and seven of their past 10, moved to 18-10-0-0 on the season (36 points), while Utah fell to 11-13-2-2.\n\nIt was the Grizzlies who jumped out in front with a pair of goals by Alex Krushelnyski and Brent Gwidt just past the midway point, before Rodwell and Brett Kulak countered to close out the frame. Kulak's goal came with 4:59 remaining in the first, the only power play tally of the game on the only chance Colorado had on the night.\n\nUtah came up short on two attempts with the man advantage,but did move in front 3-2 on Jacob Johnson's score 5:44 into the second. It took a while for Colorado to counter, but Mark Nemec helped set up both final--minute goals that beat Ryan Faragher.\n\nWith the two points, Colorado jumped to second in the Pacific Division, one point ahead of Ontario and one behind Idaho. The two teams play again Monday night in Salt Lake City.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEagles 4, Grizzlies 3\n\nAt Utah\n\nColorado 2 2 0 \u2014 4\n\nUtah 2 1 0 \u2014 3\n\nFirst period \u2014 1.
