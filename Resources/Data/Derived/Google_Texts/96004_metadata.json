These collaborations produced some of the group\u2019s most indelible moments \u2014 from B-52s member Kate Pierson\u2019s brassy hollers on \u201cShiny Happy People\u201d and keening harmonies lacing through \u201cMe In Honey\u201d and Patti Smith adding ghostly, longing gravitas to \u201cE-Bow the Letter\u201d to Peaches spicing up \u201cAlligator Aviator Autopilot Antimatter\u201d with bratty punk charm and KRS-One adding funky hip-hop flair to \u201cRadio Song.\u201d\n\nBut in addition to these notable appearances, R.E.M. has teamed up with plenty more high-profile names. Some of these performances happened spontaneously during concerts; some were deliberate studio or TV collaborations; and still others were happy accidents. Here are 10 of R.E.M.\u2019s most overlooked (or little-known) collaborations and collaborators.\n\nThe Byrds\u2019 Roger McGuinn\n\nIn June 1984, legendary Byrds guitarist and Rickenbacker enthusiast Roger McGuinn joined R.E.M. onstage in New Jersey to perform a pair of songs (including \u201cSo You Want to Be a Rock \u2018n\u2019 Roll Star\u201d and Them\u2019s \u201cGloria\u201d) for an MTV special, \u201cRock Influences: Folk Rock.\u201d McGuinn would join the band at a 1985 Florida show as well.\n\nThe Lovin\u2019 Spoonful\u2019s John Sebastian\n\n\n\nNot only did high-quality video of McGuinn\u2019s New Jersey appearance surface in recent years \u2014 so did pristine video taken at the same show featuring R.E.M.\u2019s run-through of the Lovin\u2019 Spoonful\u2019s \u201cDo You Believe In Magic?\u201d with the song\u2019s writer, John Sebastian.\n\nJohnny Marr\n\nR.E.M.\u2019s last major North American tour featured Modest Mouse as one of the opening acts. At the time, that band featured Smiths guitarist Johnny Marr as a sideman. Naturally, the ever-affable Marr hopped onstage several times with R.E.M. to add some extra chime to \u201cFall On Me.\u201d\n\nLos Lobos\u2019 Steve Berlin\n\nWhen it came time to add saxophone to songs, the members of R.E.M. were judicious not only about how often they used the instrument \u2014 but who played the part. For the \u201cDocument\u201d tune \u201cFirehouse,\u201d the job went to Steve Berlin, a saxophonist known for his work with the Blasters and Los Lobos. Unlike many \u201980s sax lines, Berlin\u2019s contribution still sounds fresh and vital today.\n\nBilly Bragg & Robyn Hitchcock", "article_metadata": {"description": "Think of R.E.M. as Berry/Buck/Mills/Stipe?
