Issues with low reimbursements and slow-to-pay reimbursements to doctors and hospitals cause some places to refuse Medicaid patients.\n\nManning\n\n\"When people in Medicaid have trouble accessing primary care, they often end up in the emergency room,\" Manning notes, pointing to a January study in Oregon that found Medicaid expansion was leading to an increase of ER visits.\n\nTweet to @IWF\n\nManning believes that these problems result in lower or bleaker health outcomes for people who are on Medicaid versus a privately insured population, adding this story serves to underscore that having an insurance card is not the same as having access to healthcare.\n\nShe summarizes her concerns: \"So when we look at a Medicaid program, I would advise not to expand the program but instead to go back to the drawing board. And reform the program so that it better serves the people who may be truly are indigent poor and need to rely on some safety net program. The safety net program has far too many holes in it today and many people are not being served well.\"", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.onenewsnow.com/politics-govt/2014/07/28/oregon-shows-whats-wrong-with-medicaid-expansion-says-healthcare-analyst", "image": {"width": 800, "identifier": "http://www.onenewsnow.com/images/ogimage.jpg", "height": 500}, "description": "A healthcare analyst says the Medicaid issue is important for people to pay attention to with Obamacare.&#160;", "title": "Oregon shows what's wrong with Medicaid expansion, says healthcare analyst"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.onenewsnow.com/images/ogimage.jpg", "title": "Oregon shows what's wrong with Medicaid expansion, says healthcare analyst", "description": "A healthcare analyst says the Medicaid issue is important for people to pay attention to with Obamacare.&#160;", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@onenewsnowcom"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1597751183824293}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "A health policy analyst says the Medicaid issue is important for people to pay attention to with Obamacare."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0c35\"", "article_summary": "The safety net program has far too many holes in it today and many people are not being served well.\"\nShe summarizes her concerns: \"So when we look at a Medicaid program, I would advise not to expand the program but instead to go back to the drawing board.\nAnd reform the program so that it better serves the people who may be truly are indigent poor and need to rely on some safety net program.\nA healthcare analyst says the Medicaid issue is important for people to pay attention to with Obamacare.\nThe Associated Press has found \"an unexpected rush of enrollees\" in Oregon has worsened problems associated with a widespread physician shortage."}
