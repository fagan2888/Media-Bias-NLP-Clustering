Now more than ever, lives are at stake.\n\nYet Islam has long provoked little but confused, misleading commentary from well-meaning journalists, especially those eager to side with the oppressed and show solidarity with the downtrodden. In the West, the 1,400-year-old faith serves as a guiding light for its predominantly (nonwhite) adherents, who come from lands with histories of colonialism and often suffer discrimination from the various, mostly white European and North American societies in which they dwell. Not surprisingly, as a result, Islam has secured a place in the identity politics of our time. Criticize Islam, and you are perceived as attacking a minority community, which leaves you open to charges of racism.\n\nMore specifically, the charge is usually of \u201cIslamophobia,\u201d which feebleminded thinkers equate with racism, though Islam is neither a race nor an ethnicity, but a religion with devotees of all skin pigments on every continent. Criticize Islam \u2014 its doctrines of jihad and martyrdom, its accordance of second-class status to women, for instance \u2014 and you really are attacking an ideology. Yet our reigning state of politicized hysteria and linguistic decadence ensure the word, which is nothing but a shoddy semantic ruse inimical to free speech, lasting currency and even a sort of vogue. True freedom of speech, however, means being able to criticize the most contentious subject of all \u2014 religion. There is, thus, nothing \u201cphobic\u201d about attacking Islam. We all are, or should be, perfectly free to attack Islam, or, conversely, to laud it. It is just one religion \u2014 that is, ideology \u2014 among many, and all religions are fair game for critics.\n\nNota bene: The word is \u201cIslamophobia,\u201d not \u201cMuslimophobia.\u201d \u201cIslamophobia\u201d specifies as the object of fear the religion itself, not Muslims as people. Journalists who level charges of Islamophobia may hope to denounce harassers of Muslims, but in fact they are serving as useful idiots for Islamists by helping squelch debate about Islam, as though Islam could not possibly arouse antipathy except among bigots and other backward folk.\n\nThis is decidedly not the case. Islam is a universalist religion envisioning global triumph, with all humanity called upon to submit to God (the meaning of \u201cIslam\u201d itself), Sharia, and a much-anticipated Judgment Day, when nonbelievers will find themselves roasting in hellfire. Any liberal should find plenty therein to object to, to put it mildly. A religion that demands we all submit to it deserves to be critiqued by all \u2014 and vigorously, no matter what identity politics and political correctness say, and no matter how loudly Trump fulminates against it.\n\nThus I now find myself obliged to examine a report in Vox by Max Fisher, \u201cIt\u2019s not just Trump: Islamophobia in America is spiraling out of control.\u201d Fisher\u2019s piece, published just before the San Bernardino attack, purports to examine the growing problem of anti-Muslim harassment in the United States, but it decries as \u201cIslamophobes\u201d all, including liberals, who dare raise a voice against Islam per se. Of the inherently divisive dogma that forms the basis of both \u201cmainstream Islam\u201d and the faith\u2019s radical, ISIS-type interpretations Fisher says not a word. Islam\u2019s critics, as he would have it, are just bigots and have to be exposed as such.\n\nFisher opens with a look at the recent disruptive scene in a community forum in Fredericksburg, Virginia, that ensued when an outraged local shouted down a Muslim resident hoping to discuss a zoning permit for a new Islamic center, calling Islam an \u201cevil cult\u201d and all Muslims \u201cterrorists.\u201d Fisher then brings in Donald Trump and his plans for a Muslim database, noting that Trump was \u201cmerely indulging a sentiment that was already widespread.\u201d Fisher offers us the confused, deceptive definition of \u201canti-Muslim hatred and fear, a form of bigotry known as Islamophobia,\u201d I have presented above, and warns that it is \u201crampaging out of control,\u201d with \u201cvery real and legitimately scary implications for the millions of Americans who follow Islam.\u201d\n\nFisher cites other instances of anti-Muslim harassment (intimidation, vandalizations of mosques, and assaults on Muslims), but then describes the February 2015 Chapel Hill murders as \u201ca sign of the growing hatred toward Muslims in this country.\u201d For Fisher, the \u201cclimate [of Islamophobia] had allowed the murders to happen . . . and let them go initially ignored.\u201d Yet to date prosecutors have not labeled this a hate crime. As far as we know, the unhinged North Carolina atheist killed three young Muslims in his apartment complex over a parking space, not because of their religion. The Chapel Hill tragedy still appears to be what it looked like at the time: a massacre carried out by an unbalanced person for trivial reasons, in a country awash with firearms. It cannot be adduced as proof of \u201cIslamophobia,\u201d in other words.\n\nFisher then piles on statistics about Republican belief in Obama\u2019s alleged Muslim faith, the widespread fear of Islam and Sharia among Republicans, and more, including a poll showing that \u201c56 percent of Americans see Islam as at odds with American values.\u201d All this, he says, is evidence of a \u201cconcerted and deliberate campaign to promote anti-Muslim fear and hatred,\u201d and one that, after the Paris attacks, has resulted in a reluctance to admit Syrian refugees to the United States.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The First Amendment protects speech and religion.
