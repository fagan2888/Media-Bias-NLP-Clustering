Rand Paul (R-KY), a candidate for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination, about his positions on terrorism and the recently passed omnibus spending bill passed by Congress and signed into law by President Barack Obama last week.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nPaul also took on Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL), one of Paul\u2019s opponents for the GOP nod, who has missed a lot votes in the U.S. Senate while campaigning for president.\n\n\u201cIt may have been the most important vote of the year, but certainly the largest spending bill of the year,\u201d Paul said. \u201cAnd yeah, I think if you are being paid by the taxpayer, you should show up and vote. And so I think this is a big issue. And for him to say he\u2019s only going to show up when it\u2019s a close vote, I don\u2019t think that passes muster. And I think really that he ought to just resign or probably give his pay back because he\u2019s not really earning his pay at this point.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut yeah, this spending bill was something that was horrendous,\u201d he continued. \u201cIt was a $1.1 trillion spending bill. It bust the budget caps and it also shows that the complicity on deficit spending. Both parties deserve some blame here. That\u2019s what I\u2019ve been saying all along. The right wants military spending. The left wants left spending. But in order to get what they want, the right has to give the left welfare spending. Everybody gets what they want except for the taxpayer who gets stuck with the bill.\u201d\n\nFollow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor", "article_metadata": {"description": "Rand Paul: Rubio 'Should Resign or Give Back His Pay'", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Rand Paul: Rubio 'Should Resign or Give Back His Pay'", "title": "Rand Paul: Rubio Should Resign or Give Back His Pay - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 932, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/12/Paul1223.jpg", "height": 699}, "updated_time": "2015-12-23T21:06:44-07:00", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/video/2015/12/23/rand-paul-rubio-should-resign-or-give-back-his-pay/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Rand Paul: Rubio 'Should Resign or Give Back His Pay'", "creator": "@jeff_poor", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/12/Paul1223.jpg", "title": "Rand Paul: Rubio Should Resign or Give Back His Pay - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Hannity, Marco Rubio, Mark Steyn, Rand Paul,2016 Presidential Race, Breitbart TV,Rand Paul", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "published_time": "2015-12-23T21:05:52-07:00", "section": "2016 Presidential Race", "modified_time": "2015-12-23T21:06:44-07:00", "tag": "Rand Paul", "categories": "Breitbart TV,2016 Presidential Race"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "The left wants left spending.\n\u201cIt may have been the most important vote of the year, but certainly the largest spending bill of the year,\u201d Paul said.\nAnd I think really that he ought to just resign or probably give his pay back because he\u2019s not really earning his pay at this point.\u201d\u201cBut yeah, this spending bill was something that was horrendous,\u201d he continued.\n\u201cIt was a $1.1 trillion spending bill.\nThe right wants military spending."}
