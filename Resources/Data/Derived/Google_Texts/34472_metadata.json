(AP) \u2014 Nebraska\u2019s longest-serving lawmaker drops to one knee and spreads more than five-dozen sheets of notepaper across the floor of his office.\n\nSen. Ernie Chambers points to pencil sketches of a man, a pig and a hairy Cyclops. Behind him sits a box of framed portraits, created with a childhood skill he\u2019s quietly honed during a 40-year legislative career. Between drawn-out committee hearings and floor debates, Chambers has built a sketch-art portfolio featuring everyone from Malcolm X to Gov. Pete Ricketts.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s therapeutic,\u201d said Chambers, 77. \u201cI watch the pencil and things just flow out of it \u2014 words that rhyme and pictures that shade themselves. Sometimes, I\u2019m not even concentrating on making a picture. I\u2019m just putting lines on a sheet of paper.\u201d\n\nHis fellow lawmakers have taken notice \u2014 and even asked for copies of some of the work.\n\nChambers, of Omaha, served 38 years in Nebraska\u2019s one-house Legislature before voters enacted term limits that forced him from office. The self-described \u201cDefender of the Downtrodden\u201d was elected again in 2012 after sitting out the minimum time required. He\u2019s legendary for his repeated attempts to abolish the death penalty, his knack for derailing legislation he opposes and the sweatshirts and jeans he wears at the Capitol amid others\u2019 suits and ties. In 2007, the left-leaning independent sued God to make a point about frivolous lawsuits.\n\nChambers said he doodles in committee hearings to fight boredom when familiar issues arise. In the first 45 days of this year\u2019s session, he scrawled more than 60 images on sheets the size of a hotel notepad.\n\nHe captions his drawings with random thoughts. Beneath his Cyclops, Chambers wrote: \u201cMan, oh, man. I can\u2019t wait for evolution to kick in! Things can only get better!!!\u201d\n\nWhen Omaha attorney Dave Domina spoke this month in a hearing related to the Keystone XL pipeline, he wasn\u2019t just testifying: He was unknowingly posing for a portrait. As Domina argued for tougher regulations on oil pipelines \u2014 a bill Chambers introduced \u2014 Chambers\u2019 pen gave shape to a slender face, suit and glasses.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Longtime Nebraska senator flexes a second skill: sketching", "title": "Longtime Nebraska senator flexes a second skill: sketching", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Longtime Nebraska senator flexes a second skill: sketching", "title": "Longtime Nebraska senator flexes a second skill: sketching", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/03/22/longtime_nebraska_senator_flexes_a_second_skill_sketching/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/03/legislative-doodles-nebraska.jpeg2-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Longtime Nebraska senator flexes a second skill: sketching", "title": "Longtime Nebraska senator flexes a second skill: sketching", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/03/legislative-doodles-nebraska.jpeg2-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Grant Schulte", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe199e\"", "article_summary": "As Domina argued for tougher regulations on oil pipelines \u2014 a bill Chambers introduced \u2014 Chambers\u2019 pen gave shape to a slender face, suit and glasses.\nBehind him sits a box of framed portraits, created with a childhood skill he\u2019s quietly honed during a 40-year legislative career.\nChambers, of Omaha, served 38 years in Nebraska\u2019s one-house Legislature before voters enacted term limits that forced him from office.\n\u201cI watch the pencil and things just flow out of it \u2014 words that rhyme and pictures that shade themselves.\nSen.
