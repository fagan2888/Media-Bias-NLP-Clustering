I\u2019m sure you remember the story of Miles Scott, the five year old leukemia survivor who got to be Batkid for a day, as San Francisco transformed itself into Gotham while Miles saved everyone from various nefarious villains. Pretty much the entire country was swept up in the story, and even a die-hard old cynic like yours truly couldn\u2019t avoid a bit of tearing up (no doubt from the high pollen count that day). It was a darned near perfect story.\n\nSo how could anyone have a problem with it? Enter San Francisco Supervisor Eric Mar. As the rest of the city came out in droves to cheer Miles on to victory for the good guys, Mar was busy taking to his Twitter account.\n\nAs the whole world watched San Francisco transform itself into Gotham City for little Miles Scott, Mar tweeted: \u201cWondering how many 1000s of SF kids living off SNAP/FoodStamps could have been fed from the $$.\u201d Faster than you could say \u201cHoly Social Media,\u201d tweeters shot back. \u201cDenigrating the make a wish program. How incredibly low of you,\u201d one said. \u201cWay to be a wet blanket,\u201d tweeted another. Most of the other replies weren\u2019t printable.\n\nMar quickly tried to backpedal, with a rather limp sounding qualifier of \u201c I probably should have started the tweet with, \u2018Love the Batkid,\u2019 to be clear that I support \u2026\u201d but it was too late. The damage was done, and it was clear that the Grinch had been exposed and his heart wasn\u2019t going to be growing three sizes that day or any other. But perhaps we shouldn\u2019t be all that surprised at this type of reaction from Mar. Other folks have been doing some digging into this particularly odious politician\u2019s past and found something of a pattern emerging. Mar is a big time, Bloombergesque nanny stater who harbors a pretty hard core, anti-American and anti-police world view. The evidence:\n\nHe\u2019s working hard on a Bloomberg style soda tax for San Francisco, saving the citizens from themselves.\n\nHe was the author of the now existing ban on toys in Happy Meals, because it could cause children to \u2026 oh, I have no idea.\n\nHe supported the end of the Junior ROTC program in San Francisco schools. (You don\u2019t want people getting all military, doncha know\u2026)\n\nHe supported a resolution to drop all charges against seven cop killers.\n\nHe pushed for a 2003 resolution which would have mandated students to miss school to attend an anti-war protest.\n\nThis guy is a real piece of work, and no doubt about it. But I suppose if you make the choice to live in San Francisco, you\u2019re going to run into this sort of a fairly frequent basis. And they\u2019re not just walking the streets, either\u2026 they are in high city offices. But seriously\u2026 the Batkid? This may be a new low for Supervisor Mar.\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "Loser", "title": "What kind of person disses the Batkid?", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2013/11/23/what-kind-of-person-disses-the-batkid/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "article": {"published_time": "2013-11-23T16:31:40+00:00", "modified_time": "2013-11-23T13:46:50+00:00"}, "keywords": "California, San Francisco,", "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9b2a\"", "article_summary": "The evidence:He\u2019s working hard on a Bloomberg style soda tax for San Francisco, saving the citizens from themselves.\nBut I suppose if you make the choice to live in San Francisco, you\u2019re going to run into this sort of a fairly frequent basis.\nWhat kind of person disses the Batkid?\nEnter San Francisco Supervisor Eric Mar.\nHe supported the end of the Junior ROTC program in San Francisco schools."}
