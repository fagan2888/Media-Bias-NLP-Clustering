(There was another 2.1 Friday morning as well.)\n\nSunday\u2019s rumbled through at 6:27 p.m., and it was back on the Irving side of the fault line, more or less between MacArthur High School and the Four Seasons.\n\nIt was a strange one too \u2014 the sound that tends to precede these quakes lasted a little longer than usual. It wasn\u2019t the usual boom; it was more like a long, low rumble, at least in Northwest Dallas.\n\nAnd it only took the U.S. Geological Survey 10 minutes to track and post it to the website, which is so SoCal.", "article_metadata": {"liveFyreID": "aHR0cDovL3RoZXNjb29wYmxvZy5kYWxsYXNuZXdzLmNvbS8yMDE1LzEyL3N1bmRheS1ldmVuaW5nLW91ci1mb3VydGgtZWFydGhxdWFrZS1pbi1mb3VyLWRheXMtdGhpcy1vbmUtYS0yLThtLWluLWlydmluZy5odG1sLw==", "generator": "WordPress 3.9.12", "author": "Robert Wilonsky", "og": {"site_name": "The Scoop Blog", "description": "For the fourth day in a row, we had an earthquake.
