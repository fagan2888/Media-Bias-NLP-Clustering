U.S. Rep. Mike Fitzpatrick penned a letter to President Obama last week saying the president’s Affordable Care Act had caused Sesame Place, an important tourist attraction, to terminate health benefits for its part-time staff, Philly.com reported.

“This law is hurting real people in my district and around the country,” the Republican wrote.

A spokesman for SeaWorld, the amusement park’s parent company, confirmed Wednesday that the company was cutting the hours for part-time employees, but he did not confirm that Obamacare was the cause, Philly.com reported. SeaWorld did not say how many workers would be affected by the reduction in hours or the insurance change.

Under the Affordable Care Act, companies can face penalties for not providing health insurance for employees who work at least 30 hours per week.

Mr. Fitzpatrick, a Bucks County resident, said Sesame Place employs 1,650 people and brings $75 million in economic activity to the county each year, Philly.com reported.

“I continue to believe [Obamacare] must be repealed,” he wrote in the letter, “and replaced with a sustainable solution that promotes affordable access to world-class health care for which our nation is recognized.”
