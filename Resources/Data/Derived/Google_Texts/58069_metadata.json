Franklin Graham said bluntly in an interview on \u201cWashington Watch with Tony Perkins\u201d that an \u201canti-Christian bias\u201d has permeated all levels of U.S. government, beginning at the top \u2013 with President Obama and Attorney General Eric Holder.\n\nGraham, the head of Samaritan\u2019s Purse, an international aid organization, said both Obama and Holder are to blame for much of the anti-Christian rhetoric that\u2019s been coursing through the nation in recent years because they\u2019re the leaders, and they set the tone for the country. And it\u2019s that tone that\u2019s trickled from the federal level into state and local levels of government, he said, the Christian Post reported.\n\n\u201cThere is an anti-Christian bias that is now in our government, has permeated our government, that\u2019s also permeated Washington but [also] at the state and local level. It\u2019s the progressives, whatever you want to call them, that are trying \u2013 and the president is into this and the attorney general is into this 100 percent \u2013 and that is forcing on the American people a new morality.\u201d\n\nGraham also repeated concerns he expressed in previous interviews about the president\u2019s Muslim connections.\n\n\u201cOne of the problems we have, the president, his father was a Muslim and his stepfather was a Muslim \u2013 [he] lived in Indonesia and went to Muslim schools. His mother must have been a Muslim,\u201d Graham said, the Christian Post reported. \u201cWe don\u2019t know that, but she married two Muslim men, so there must have been something there. The framework that our president has [had] growing up, his influences on his life were that of Islam.\u201d\n\nConversely, Graham said his influences during his growing and developing years were all Christian and biblical.\n\n\u201cBut our president did not have that,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was Islam. Many feel that he\u2019s protecting Islam. I don\u2019t know that, but it certainly seems that way.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Free Press For A Free People Since 1997", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.1", "og": {"site_name": "WND", "description": "Rev.
