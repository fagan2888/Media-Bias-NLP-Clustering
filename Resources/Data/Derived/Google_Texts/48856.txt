South Africa

A surfing event in South Africa had to be called off on Sunday after the defending champion was attacked by sharks.

Mick Fanning of Australia was competing in the World Surf League competition at Jeffreys Bay on the eastern Cape, when a shark approached his surfboard.

"And then, all of a sudden, I started getting pulled underwater. And then the thing came up. And I was on my board and it was right there. I saw the whole thing just thrashing around, but I was getting dragged under by my leg rope and then I felt like it kicked me off, but it was still there going - I was still attached to my board," Fanning said.

Fanning, a triple world champion, was knocked off his surfboard and into the sea moments after the final of the J-Bay Open had begun.

Fanning escaped injury and the event was abandoned soon afterwards.

His opponent in the final, compatriot Julian Wilson, was also rescued.

The waters off the Cape are well known for sharks.
