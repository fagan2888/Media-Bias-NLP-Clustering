Andrew Cuomo to say that General Electric must continue cleaning up the massive pollution the company dumped into the Hudson River from 1947 to 1977. Cuomo\u2019s own environmental officials say the pollution continues to cause \u201congoing contamination,\u201d and federal officials warn that GE\u2019s plan to end its cleanup this fall could harm the effort to restore the river\u2019s ecosystem.\n\nBut the Democratic governor \u2014 who has benefited from GE\u2019s campaign cash \u2014 is declining to say whether he agrees.\n\nIn comments to reporters in Albany earlier this month, the governor said he thinks the company should \u201cfollow the law and the agreements that have been made.\u201d Under the 2002 agreement in question, GE is planning to shut down its cleanup operations at the end of 2015 \u2014 which, environmental groups claim, will leave behind at least 35 percent of the carcinogenic polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) the company dumped into the river during the mid-20th century.\n\n\u201cI know there are claims for [GE] to do more above and beyond that,\u201d Cuomo said of the request by legislators and environmental groups. But, he added, \u201cI haven\u2019t really looked into that.\u201d\n\nConservation groups said that unless Cuomo takes action, the cleanup of one of the nation\u2019s biggest environmental disasters will end prematurely, leaving carcinogenic PCBs in New York\u2019s largest waterway.\n\n\u201cGovernor Cuomo has a crucial role to play, given New York\u2019s role as a trustee of the Hudson River natural resource, contaminated for decades by GE\u2019s toxic chemicals,\u201d said Ned Sullivan, who runs the environmental group Scenic Hudson. Sullivan served as an environmental official in the administration of Mario Cuomo, Andrew Cuomo\u2019s father. \u201cThis is a legacy issue for Governor Cuomo. He will either use his authority and persuasive powers to push GE to perform a comprehensive cleanup, or he will leave the Hudson and upstate economy damaged for future generations.\u201d\n\nDemocratic state Sen. Brad Hoylman \u2014 who wrote legislators\u2019 letter to Cuomo asking him to support an ongoing cleanup \u2014 said the governor\u2019s comments will not deter the campaign to force GE to continue the dredging.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The energy company is ceasing all cleanup efforts this fall.
