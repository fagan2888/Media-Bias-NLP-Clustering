Readers who\u2019d like to highlight other noteworthy exhibits from the same issue are encouraged to make their pitch in the comments section below.\n\nMaps and health have been powerfully intertwined since nineteenth-century British physician John Snow produced a hand-drawn map that famously showed a correlation between the locations where cholera was killing hundreds of Londoners during an 1854 epidemic and the Broad Street pump where locals unknowingly drew water contaminated with the deadly bacterium.\n\nFast-forward to the twenty-first century, and maps that tell compelling stories about health, policy, and place are ubiquitous. If Snow were alive today, no doubt his stethoscope would be spinning.\n\nThe power and art of mapping, geospatial analysis, and health policy research are regularly featured in Health Affairs, but never before to the extent in the journal\u2019s November issue. Four research papers give readers five maps that depict meaningful findings about children, low-income neighborhoods, and other local characteristics that affect health and offer valuable insights for policy makers.\n\nIn \u201cA Health-In-All Policies Approach Addresses Many of Richmond, California\u2019s Place-Based Hazards, Stressors,\u201d authors Jason Corburn et al. use San Francisco Census tract and other data to show that \u201can African American child born in West Oakland will die, on average, fifteen years earlier than a white child born just a few miles away in Walnut Creek\u201d (Exhibit 1).\n\nExhibit 1\n\nIn \u201cThe Child Opportunity Index: Improving Collaboration Between Community Development And Public Health,\u201d authors Dolores Acevedo-Garcia et al. use Milwaukee, Wisconsin, as an example of how their Child Opportunity Index can produce maps showing where children face low levels of \u201cneighborhood opportunity\u201d and where populations of children are concentrated by race/ethnicity (Exhibit 2).\n\nExhibit 2\n\nIn \u201c\u2018Pharmacy Deserts\u2019 Are Prevalent In Chicago\u2019s Predominantly Minority Communities, Raising Medication Access Concerns,\u201d authors Dima Qato et al. use Census and Illinois regulatory data to show that \u201cpharmacy deserts\u201d are clustered primarily on the south and west sides of Chicago, in low-income neighborhoods where at least 50 percent of neighborhood populations are non-Hispanic black or Hispanic (Exhibit 3).\n\nExhibit 3\n\nAnyone familiar with Cincinnati, Ohio, will recognize the city\u2019s contours along the Ohio River in Exhibit 2 of \u201cHousing Code Violation Density Associated With Emergency Department And Hospital Use By Children With Asthma,\u201d by Andrew Beck et al. The map shows concentrations of asthma-related housing code violations and rates of asthma-related emergency department visits or hospitalizations at Cincinnati Children\u2019s Hospital Medical Center. The article\u2019s Exhibit 3 zooms in on the neighborhoods near the medical center and adds emergency department revisits and rehospitalizations.\n\nExhibit 2\n\nExhibit 3", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://healthaffairs.org/blog/2014/11/25/exhibit-of-the-month-maps-tell-powerful-stories-about-children-neighborhoods-and-possible-policy-solutions/", "site_name": "Health Affairs", "image": "http://healthaffairs.org/blog/wp-content/themes/HealthAffairs2015/images/facebook-default.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "Exhibit Of The Month: Maps Tell Powerful Stories About Children, Neighborhoods, And Possible Policy Solutions"}, "description": "Exhibit Of The Month: Maps Tell Powerful Stories About Children, Neighborhoods, And Possible Policy Solutions | At the intersection of health, health care, and policy.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce96a\"", "article_summary": "Fast-forward to the twenty-first century, and maps that tell compelling stories about health, policy, and place are ubiquitous.\nIn \u201cA Health-In-All Policies Approach Addresses Many of Richmond, California\u2019s Place-Based Hazards, Stressors,\u201d authors Jason Corburn et al.\nThe power and art of mapping, geospatial analysis, and health policy research are regularly featured in Health Affairs, but never before to the extent in the journal\u2019s November issue.\nExhibit 1In \u201cThe Child Opportunity Index: Improving Collaboration Between Community Development And Public Health,\u201d authors Dolores Acevedo-Garcia et al.\nExhibit 2In \u201c\u2018Pharmacy Deserts\u2019 Are Prevalent In Chicago\u2019s Predominantly Minority Communities, Raising Medication Access Concerns,\u201d authors Dima Qato et al."}
