Remember those optimistic reproductive rights predictions for 2014? Well, it seems the year is already off to a good start.

Vermont this week introduced legislation to strike down any remaining statutes criminalizing abortion in the state in order to recognize and protect a woman’s right to abortion.

As Emily Crockett at RH Reality Check notes, the statutes currently on the books predate Roe v. Wade and are thus unenforceable, but the coalition of lawmakers behind the bill believe that formally invalidating them would “serve as an important legislative action in support of a woman’s reproductive rights as well as help a health care provider to perform an abortion without fear of criminal liability.”
