Insomnia. Depression. Thoughts of suicide.\n\nFor those who have witnessed an extremely frightening or shocking event, these symptoms can consume their lives, disrupt relationships with family and friends, and interfere with work or school. It\u2019s a condition called post-traumatic stress disorder, known commonly as PTSD.\n\nNow researchers at the University of Cincinnati are planning to test a new medication that might ease the symptoms of PTSD, particularly among military personnel and police officers.\n\nAbout AtEase UC is one of 25 study sites across the country carrying out AtEase. The study seeks: Men and women, age 18-65.\n\nThose serving or who have served in the military, law enforcement, or with Homeland Security, Secret Service, an intelligence agency, or who have worked as a military contractor.\n\nParticipants must have suffered a work-related trauma after the year 2000. The study will last about 12 weeks. Individuals who qualify will receive evaluations and study medication at no cost and will be compensated for time and travel. For more information about the AtEase study, call 513-558-6612 or email Alicia.Heller@uc.edu .\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not uncommon for military personnel and police officers to experience post-traumatic stress disorder,\u201d said Dr. Lesley Arnold , a professor of psychiatry and behavioral neuroscience at the UC College of Medicine. \u201cIn their efforts to protect all of us, they may get into life-threatening situations. They may witness or experience very traumatic events, and bad exposure puts them at risk for PTSD.\u201d\n\nTo find a safe, effective treatment, Arnold and her colleagues at UC will test a formulation of a medication called cyclobenzaprine , TNX-102 SL, manufactured by Tonix Pharmaceuticals Inc. New York-based Tonix specializes in medicines for nervous system disorders.\n\nThe UC team\u2019s work is part of a nationwide clinical research trial, called the AtEase Study , that will evaluate how well the medication works compared with a placebo. Participants will take the medication once a day, before bedtime. It dissolves under the tongue, and it\u2019s specifically designed to reduce sleep disturbances and lessen the intensity of PTSD symptoms.\n\nAtEase will be a double-blind study, meaning neither participants nor those who administer the study will know during the trial who\u2019s getting the medicine and who\u2019s getting a placebo.\n\n\u201cThe goal is to see if the medication can improve the quality of sleep in individuals with post-traumatic stress disorder and reduce distressing dreams and nightmares,\u201d said Arnold. \u201cAnd the hope would be that this will improve the quality of life and also reduce the daytime symptoms associated with post-traumatic stress disorder.\u201d\n\nSignificant problem among vets\n\nArnold says that PTSD has become a significant problem for returning veterans and that there is a great need for better treatments.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, 7 percent to 8 percent of people in the general U.S. population will have PTSD at some point in their lives. For members of the armed forces, the numbers are significantly higher:\n\nUp to 20 percent of Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom suffer from PTSD in a given year.\n\nAbout 12 percent of Gulf War veterans suffer from PTSD in a given year.\n\nNearly a third of Vietnam War veterans, about 30 percent, have had PTSD in their lifetimes.\n\n\u201cThe symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder can be very serious and negatively impact a person\u2019s life,\u201d said Arnold. \u201cAnd the symptoms can last for years after exposure to a traumatic event.\u201d\n\nThose symptoms can include:\n\nDistressing dreams and flashbacks.\n\nAvoidance of events that remind a person of the trauma.\n\nHypervigilance (reacting to sounds that wouldn\u2019t normally cause stress).\n\nEmotional numbing.\n\nDepression and thoughts of suicide.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very important for us to address this problem,\u201d said Arnold. \u201cWe need to develop more treatment options for these individuals and medications that might reduce the intensity of their symptoms, so they can improve the quality of their life.\u201c\n\n\u201cUltimately we\u2019d like to reduce risks associated with post-traumatic stress disorder, such as depression and suicide,\u201d she said.", "article_metadata": {"isStory": "true", "isPremium": "true", "description": "Researchers at the University of Cincinnati are taking part in a nationwide test of a new medication that might ease the symptoms of PTSD, particularly among military personnel and police officers.", "author": "Gretchen MacKnight and Mark Bowen, WCPO contributors", "og": {"site_name": "WCPO", "description": "Researchers at the University of Cincinnati are taking part in a nationwide test of a new medication that might ease the symptoms of PTSD, particularly among military personnel and police officers.", "title": "Checkups: AtEase clinical trial may help bring PTSD sufferers relief", "url": "http://www.wcpo.com/news/health/checkups-ptsd-study", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media2.wcpo.com//photo/2013/02/06/9ONYOURSIDE_20130206092613_640_480.JPG", "height": 480}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"app": {"id": {"ipad": 481447058, "iphone": 487285628}}, "site": "@wcpo", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "shortHeadline": "Study may help bring relief to PTSD sufferers", "com.silverpop.brandeddomains": "www.pages03.net,scripps.mkt7057.com,www.wcpo.com,recp.mkt32.net", "p": {"domain_verify": "a78af9666708be3dd31e4873ef3fe3bb"}, "fb": {"app_id": 158963910840295}, "idio": {"hasVideo": "true", "isPremium": "true", "author": "Gretchen MacKnight and Mark Bowen, WCPO contributors"}, "keywords": "WCPO, Cincinnati, University of Cincinnati, UC, post-traumatic stress disorder, PTSD, clinical trial, cyclobenzaprine, TNX-102 SL, Tonix Pharmaceuticals", "google-site-verification": "sm7O5zR5rUkxnJfpcpz3wyw0vAlwmh13H5_FvJEfM-g", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/WCPO9", "section": "Health", "published_time": "2015-05-29T16:01:38+0000", "modified_time": "2015-05-29T16:01:38+0000"}, "hasVideo": "true", "viewport": "width=device-width, target-densitydpi=device-dpi, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2aec\"", "article_summary": "Individuals who qualify will receive evaluations and study medication at no cost and will be compensated for time and travel.\nIt\u2019s a condition called post-traumatic stress disorder, known commonly as PTSD.\nIt dissolves under the tongue, and it\u2019s specifically designed to reduce sleep disturbances and lessen the intensity of PTSD symptoms.\n\u201cThe symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder can be very serious and negatively impact a person\u2019s life,\u201d said Arnold.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not uncommon for military personnel and police officers to experience post-traumatic stress disorder,\u201d said Dr. Lesley Arnold , a professor of psychiatry and behavioral neuroscience at the UC College of Medicine."}
