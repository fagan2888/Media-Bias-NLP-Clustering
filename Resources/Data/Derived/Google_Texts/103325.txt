It may be hard for some people in Bay County to get out for Thanksgiving, but volunteers got an early start Thursday morning making dozens of meals for home bound seniors all throughout the area.

For almost 30 years, the Knights of Columbus Council in Panama City have partnered with the Bay County Council on Aging for Meals on Wheels.

"There are so many people that are in need of food," Volunteer Ruby Mixdorf said. "Every year we see the numbers increase of shut-ins that need food. We prepare 1-2 weeks in advance with a certain number, but always put an extra amount.'

"It's the example we set to the community," Kevin Hall with the Knights of Columbus said. "We believe in taking care of those who may not be able to take care of themselves. We want to, if just for one day, make it for them to have a nice meal for the day."

Hall says volunteers made about 115 meals Thursday morning.

According to the Council on Aging, the Knights will be back to make more meals for Christmas on Christmas Eve.
