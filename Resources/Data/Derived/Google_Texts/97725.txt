In court on Monday, Judge Porter released accused police officer Dante Servin of all charges concerning the death of Rekia Boyd. The 22-year-old was shot to death by Servin, and it was said to be in self-defense. A friend of Boyd’s, Anotonio Cross, charged at Servin with something in hand and Servin reacted.

Cross explained earlier in trial that he only had a cell phone in his pocket, not a gun. Servin, however, felt he was in danger and therefore pulled his gun and fired, injuring Cross and killing Boyd. Servin was charged with involuntary manslaughter, but people clearly do not agree. Most people involved in the case do not understand how Boyd was killed, when she was not the one attacking Servin. However; Porter said that in the case of involuntary manslaughter, when someone points a gun in the general direction of another person, it is considered a threat.

Servin explained that any other police officer would have reacted the same way, but there are many that are in disagreement with this ruling. Lawyers that were in the courtroom, or following the case, said that it was wrong and it should never have happened. The sister of Boyd shouted at the judge, and was not willing to keep quiet about the fact that her sister was murdered. As Servin left the courtroom, surrounded by other police officers, people called him a murderer. Either way, the ruling is final, and Servin is free. As a result, the family of Boyd has to live with what most would call an injustice, for the rest of their lives.
