So considering the roughly 180,000 illegal immigrants \u2014 which a 2011 Pew Center study determined lived in Colorado \u2014 the number of people in the state benefiting from the Obama order is about 60,000.\n\nSteven Camarota, director of Research for the Center for Immigration Studies, said exact state and national figures are difficult to ascertain because the people aren\u2019t here legally.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no reason to believe the distribution will be different state by state from national figures,\u201d he said, \u201cbut it\u2019s really a \u2018guestimate.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe real question is what all those newly protected immigrants will cost, which depends on a number of factors, including whether the immigrants benefiting from the order will also receive entitlement benefits.\n\nRector\u2019s study shows that the average illegal-immigrant household, defined at 3.7 people, now get a net of about $14,000 in taxpayer-funded benefits more than the taxes they pay.\n\n\u201cIn 2010, the average unlawful immigrant household received around $24,721 in government benefits and services while paying some $10,334 in taxes,\u201d the study said, including public education, infrastructure and other services as taxpayer-funded benefits.\n\nBut the study shows non-deportation initially will lower net household benefits to about $11,000 per household each year; protected immigrants can get better paying jobs and pay more in taxes. The government will also begin collecting taxes on \u201cunder the table\u201d cash.\n\nBut that equation flips if the immigrants qualify for benefits, such as welfare, ACA subsidies and tax credits, the study shows. The cost would be $28,000 a year per household \u2014 about $454 million a year in Colorado \u2014 if one multiplies the Heritage study household estimates by the average illegal immigrant households in Colorado.\n\nNationwide, the Heritage study said the immigrants benefiting from the executive order would receive $9.4 trillion benefits but pay only $3.1 trillion in taxes over their lives.\n\n\u201cThese costs would have to be borne by already overburdened U.S. taxpayers,\u201d the study says.\n\nBut state officials both in executive agencies and the Legislature have not calculated the costs to the state budge because it\u2019s unclear what will happen with the executive order or any subsequent congressional action.\n\n\u201cWe have not done any estimates or projections of this sort,\u201d wrote Colorado Department of Health Care Policy and Financing spokesman Marc Williams in an email exchange. \u201cAs you might imagine, if we committed staff to doing estimates/projections every time a new political \u2018what if\u2019 arose out of Washington, it would be a significant drain on state resources and for little, if any, value.\u201d\n\nHCPF in September estimated 72 percent of Medicaid recipients, who are mostly not-fee-for-service beneficiaries, cost taxpayers an average of $2,700 a year for medical coverage. If all 60,000 Colorado legalized immigrants receive those benefits, costs would exceed $162 million annually.\n\nRector said it\u2019s nearly impossible to imagine immigrants under the executive order won\u2019t eventually receive additional benefits, as programs such as the ACA depend on full participation. Americans won\u2019t allow people to suffer in poverty without some assistance.\n\n\u201cHow can Congress say you can stay, but we\u2019re not going to give you access to medical care, food stamps?\u201d Rector said. \u201cThat\u2019s just not going to happen.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Watchdog.org", "description": "60,000 in Colorado could bet amnesty but the net costs to taxpayers is not known.", "title": "About 60,000 immigrants in Colorado may benefit from amnesty, but costs are unknown - Watchdog.org", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2014/11/RobertRector-e1416608386890.png", "updated_time": "2014-12-01T10:10:53+00:00", "url": "http://watchdog.org/184109/60000-immigrants-colorado-may-benefit-amnesty-costs-unknown/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Watchdogorg", "section": "Colorado", "tag": "benefits,immigration amnesty,Social Security,Taxpayer,Taxpayers,welfare", "published_time": "2014-12-01T04:00:22+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-12-01T10:10:53+00:00"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Watchdog.org", "description": "60,000 in Colorado could bet amnesty but the net costs to taxpayers is not known.", "title": "About 60,000 immigrants in Colorado may benefit from amnesty, but costs are unknown - Watchdog.org", "image": {"src": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2014/11/capitol-full-e1416520009640.jpg"}, "creator": "@watchdogorg", "site": "@watchdogorg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive", "description": "60,000 in Colorado could bet amnesty but the net costs to taxpayers is not known."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbf0c\"", "article_summary": "If all 60,000 Colorado legalized immigrants receive those benefits, costs would exceed $162 million annually.\nBy Arthur Kane | Watchdog.orgPresident Obama\u2019s immigration order could help about 60,000 illegal immigrants in Colorado, and though the costs to taxpayers are unknown, they could be substantial.\nThe cost would be $28,000 a year per household \u2014 about $454 million a year in Colorado \u2014 if one multiplies the Heritage study household estimates by the average illegal immigrant households in Colorado.\nBut that equation flips if the immigrants qualify for benefits, such as welfare, ACA subsidies and tax credits, the study shows.\n\u201cThese costs would have to be borne by already overburdened U.S. taxpayers,\u201d the study says."}
