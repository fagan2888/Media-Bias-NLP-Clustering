(Photo: Detroit Free Press illustration)Buy Photo Story Highlights Some plans are more expensive, in part, because carriers can boost rates as members age\n\nMore insurers, more choices, more confusion \u2014 and a shorter time to sort it all out.\n\nThat's what consumers are facing in the second year of the Michigan Health Insurance Marketplace, established under federal health reform.\n\nEnrollment began Nov. 15 and the first deadline is just eight days away \u2014 Dec. 15. That's to buy health care coverage that will kick in Jan. 1. Plans purchased between Dec. 16 and the close of enrollment, Feb. 15, are effective the following month if they're purchased and paid for by the 15th.\n\nIn 73 of Michigan's 83 counties, the number of plan options on the exchange have more than doubled, according to an analysis by the Center for Healthcare Research and Transformation in Ann Arbor.\n\nBumped off your old health insurance? Here's how to start shoppping for new plans. Robin Erb/Detroit Free Press\n\nIn Wayne County, a dozen insurers \u2014 up three from last year \u2014 offer 126 plans to consumers who purchase insurance on their own rather than receive it from an employer. That's up from 52 plans last year, according to the same report. Oakland and Macomb counties also are seeing a surge in choices \u2014 up to 123 plans this year.\n\nBut while the competition has forced premiums down in some plans, price tags have swelled in other plans.\n\nThat's especially true for aging consumers. The 2010 Affordable Care Act means carriers can't adjust rates because of a consumer's health status, but carriers can factor in your age in setting premiums.\n\nAdditionally, those whose income has increased may find the federal subsidy to help cover monthly premiums has decreased.\n\nConsumers who don't reenroll will be automatically renewed in their current plans. That could mean big costs if they're not careful. Plan benefits can shift from year to year.\n\nTips: What you need to know as you shop for health care\n\nRelated: New challenges in health reform outreach\n\nAsthma? : This insurer wants to talk to you\n\nRelated: Baffled by health reform?

It depends on whether you had coverage before. It depends on how much your plan changed and how often you go to the doctor.\"\n\nNo doubt there will be more people asking those questions. More than 272,000 Michiganders on the individual market \u2014 those without employer coverage \u2014 chose a plan through March 31 this year at www.healthcare.gov.\n\nBut thousands more remain without coverage, including those who didn't decide in time, didn't know about the deadline or simply decided to face the tax penalty for going without insurance.\n\nThat means a second year, too, of outreach by consumer advocates who say last year's enrollment captured those who were waiting for coverage or who were approached when they sought emergency medical care.\n\nThis year will be tougher, and they'll be reaching into homeless shelters and into communities where English is a secondary language, for example.\n\n\"What we found is that while the remaining uninsured are harder to reach ... they're not harder to convince once they have the information,\" said Anne Filipic, president of Enroll America, a national outreach group with a Michigan chapter.\n\nOpen enrollment, which lasted for six months during the first year, is reduced to three months this year.\n\nContact Robin Erb at rerb@freepress.com or at 313-222-2708.
