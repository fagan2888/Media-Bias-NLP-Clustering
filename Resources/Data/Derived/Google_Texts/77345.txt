More big changes are in store for hospital medical care in Missoula. Providence St. Patrick hospital announced today it is adding comprehensive women's and children's services, including obstetrical and newborn care, and a Level 2 neonatal intensive care unit. The new services will duplicate services at Missoula's other hospital - Community Medical Center - and the announcement comes in the wake of Community's recent decision to become a for-profit hospital under the new ownership of the Billings Clinic and Regional Care Network.

St. Pat's CEO Jeff Fee told News Director Sally Mauk that St. Pat's is adding the new services in part because of the impact of the Affordable Care Act - and because of Community's decision to become a for-profit hospital.
