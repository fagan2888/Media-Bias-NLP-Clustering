HOUSTON (CBS Houston) – Thousands of Texans are finding that even with the Healthcare.gov fixes, they still aren’t getting everything they want.

Many are finding the health care plan they can afford doesn’t include their doctor, reports WOAI.

The Texas Medical Association says some insurance companies have dropped doctors, specialists and even hospitals from the plans they offer on Healthcare.gov.

TMA president Dr. Stephen Brotherton says this is counterproductive.

“People who have a primary care doctor have a tendency to live longer, live safer, live better, live more healthy,” he told the station.

Brotherton saysonly one health care provider is making policies available under the Affordable Care Act in some Texas counties.

If a patient’s doctor is not on the plan, they must find a plan that is not on the exchange or pay cash to see their regular doctor.

Texans are dependent on the federally run website because Governor Rick Perry has not set up a state-run insurance exchange.
