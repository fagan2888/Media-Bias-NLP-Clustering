That was the message Fawn Sharp presented to tribal members on March 29 following her re-election to a fourth term as President of the Nation.\n\nShe spoke about federal funding cutbacks to the impacts of climate change and subsequent relocation needs. \u201cBut challenges, by definition, are obstacles that can be met and overcome, and as we do overcome them we will grow.\u201d\n\nThe Quinault Nation of 3,000 people sits on more than 208,000 acres of land in the southwestern corner of the Olympic Peninsula in Washington state.\n\nThe Nation has been working tirelessly to stay in front of climate change. Sharp has continuously been among the most vocal voices in regards to Native communities, like her own, who are dealing with rising sea levels, loss of irrigation, and more.\n\nRELATED: Climate Disruptions Hitting More and More Tribal Nations\n\n\u201cPeople should never think they live in some form of protected bubble, or that they can ignore the environment and get along just fine,\u201d Sharp recently said in an interview with ICTMN following her appearance before the House Interior Appropriations Subcommittee on March 24.\n\nRELATED: Fawn Sharp Discusses Steps to Stemming the Tide of Climate Change\n\nHer reelection capped the tribe\u2019s annual two-day General Council Meeting that also saw Tyson Johnston, vice-president, Larry Ralston, treasurer, Latosha Underwood, secretary and Gina James, first council, winning their elections.\n\nSharp\u2019s speech to the tribe was not all about obstacles ahead though. She highlighted a variety of assets, qualities and opportunities the tribe and its members possess. Among those assets were natural resources, courage and vision. \u201cWith courage and vision, we are headed for success. Why? Because we are Quinault,\u201d she said.\n\nEconomic self-reliance was a highlight of her speech. She commended the tribe for its consistent move towards the goal of self-reliance from the tribal owned businesses to individual tribal free enterprise. Quinault Indian Nation is the largest employer in Grays Harbor County. With economic diversity that spans the Quinault Casino and Resort, tribal stores, wood chip manufacturing, dock services, gas stations, and tribal staff. Total employment sits around 3,000 people. Not to mention the various businesses owned by tribal members that is showing a steady increase as well, with the assistance of tribal training, licensing and natural resource management.\n\nThe Quinault Indian Nation has an eleven member governing body known as the Quinault Business Committee which Sharp presides over. Tribal members are democratically elected by the adult tribal membership, or general council, to serve three-year staggered terms.\n\nMembers of the QBC are seen as constitutional officers who hold the responsibility of making sure the service and performance of numerous tribal departments \u2013 social services, health care and education, road maintenance, natural resources management and emergency services \u2013 operates accordingly.\n\nSharp has a J.D. from the University of Washington, School of Law; advanced certificate in International Human Rights Law from Oxford University; and a Bachelor of Arts degree in Criminal Justice from Gonzaga University in Spokane, Washington. Among her many roles, Sharp serves as President of the Affiliated Tribes of Northwest Indians and Northwest Regional Vice President of the National Congress of American Indians.\n\nShe resides on the Quinault Indian Reservation at Lake Quinault with her husband Dan Malvini and sons Daniel, Aljah, and Jonas, and daughter, Chiara.\n\nJohnston, previously the first council, will be serving in his first term as vice president. He says he hopes to follow through on issues of concern raised by the General Council and supporting President Sharp in overcoming the obstacles the nation faces.\n\nRalston will be serving his third term as tribal treasurer. He says he looks forward to the challenges ahead and community interactions.\n\nJames has held various positions on the council over the last 11 years and will be filling the remaining two years of the first council position. \u201cI look forward to developing changes in our Education & TERO programs along with Treaty right protections,\u201d she said\n\nUnderwood enters her third term as tribal secretary. She said, \u201cThe Quinault people spoke loud and clear on the direction they want to go and the improvements they want to see. Their voices were definitely heard and I will do my best to fulfill their wishes.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Fawn Sharp, reelected to a 4th term as president of the Quinault Indian Nation on March 29, highlighted some of the challenges ahead for the Nation.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.creator": "kpolisse", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2015/04/18/fawn-sharp-re-elected-quinault-president-we-are-headed-success-160017", "type": "article", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/default/files/uploads/fawn-sharp.jpg", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "title": "Fawn Sharp Re-Elected Quinault President: \u2018We are Headed for Success\u2019"}, "abstract": "Fawn Sharp, reelected to a 4th term as president of the Quinault Indian Nation on March 29, highlighted some of the challenges ahead for the Nation.", "keywords": "Fawn Sharp, Tyson Johnston, Larry Ralston, Latosha Underwood, Gina James, Quinault Indian Nation, National Congress of American Indians, Affiliated Tribes of Northwest Indians", "dc": {"title": "Fawn Sharp Re-Elected Quinault President: \u2018We are Headed for Success\u2019"}, "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2015/04/18/fawn-sharp-re-elected-quinault-president-we-are-headed-success-160017", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "robots": "follow, index", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 0}, "dcterms.date": "2015-04-18T09:00-04:00", "dcterms.title": "Fawn Sharp Re-Elected Quinault President: \u2018We are Headed for Success\u2019"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb77c\"", "article_summary": "The Quinault Indian Nation has an eleven member governing body known as the Quinault Business Committee which Sharp presides over.\nShe resides on the Quinault Indian Reservation at Lake Quinault with her husband Dan Malvini and sons Daniel, Aljah, and Jonas, and daughter, Chiara.\nMany challenges still present for the Quinault Indian Nation.\nQuinault Indian Nation is the largest employer in Grays Harbor County.\nThat was the message Fawn Sharp presented to tribal members on March 29 following her re-election to a fourth term as President of the Nation."}
