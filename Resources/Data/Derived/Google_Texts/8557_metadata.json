Since 2000, the city of Lakeland\u2019s population has jumped 25 percent, just shy of 100,000 residents.\n\nLakeland Regional officials said they also are exploring becoming a teaching hospital for up to 250 new medical residencies a year.\n\nIn 2012, the hospital announced a high-profile partnership with the medical school at the University of South Florida. That deal, however, has failed to materialize after the departure of former USF Health leader Dr. Stephen Klasko.\n\nLakeland Regional is the third largest private employer in Lakeland, behind Wal-Mart and Publix.\n\nCheck here to see more details of the plans.\n\nReporter Abe Aboraya is part of WMFE in Orlando.
