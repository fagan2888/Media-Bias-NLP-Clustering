It was a jumping good time at the MSU Riley Center Saturday evening.

The annual Junior Auxiliary Ball was held. Hundreds of people dancing, eating, drinking and gambling. There was a silent auction with tons of goodies, including memorabilia from all sorts of places. Organizers say this is a great event and the proceeds go toward their seven service projects.

"We distribute books through our reading is fundamental program, we provide uniforms and eyeglasses to children in need, we have a fun project that provides prom dresses and formal wear to girls who need it and we just do a lot of things that helps meet the needs of children in our community,"

There were many casino games that were part of the excitement.
