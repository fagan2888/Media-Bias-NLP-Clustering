The ploy helped fuel a militant backlash against immunization workers, and as many as 60 health workers and police officers have since been killed.\n\nMeanwhile, polio is on the rise, with Pakistan accounting for 66 of the 82 cases reported so far this year by the World Health Organization. Last year, there were 93 cases of polio in Pakistan, where the health organization warns that the disease is endemic, as it is in Afghanistan and Nigeria.\n\nThe C.I.A. can no longer seek to \u201cobtain or exploit DNA or other genetic material\u201d gathered this way, according to a promise from the Obama administration.
