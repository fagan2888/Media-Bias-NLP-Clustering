Dugan\n\nImagine foregoing your rheumatoid arthritis medication because it costs more than your rent, and your insurance provider won\u2019t even consider kicking in on it until an astronomical annual deductible has been met.\n\nOr maybe your financial situation isn\u2019t that dire, but more often than not you skip your heart medication for days at a time toward the end of the month to stretch refilling the prescription until payday.\n\nThese scenarios are far from hypothetical for the staff of Victory Health Partners and are the reason the Mobile-based clinic has provided more than $20 million this year in prescription assistance for patients.\n\nThat figure is more than four times the $4.5 million in prescription assistance the clinic facilitated in 2012, nearly twice the $10.8 million it provided in 2014, and is expected to reach nearly $25 million by the close of 2015.\n\n\u201cPharmaceutical companies are required by federal law to assist those who can\u2019t afford their medications, but since they\u2019re providing them for free, it\u2019s a lengthy process,\u201d said Victory Health Development Director Kim Garrett. \u201cIt takes a lot of time and paperwork, making sure the signatures are in just the right places and absolutely every i is dotted and every t is crossed.\u201d.\n\nThe clinic dedicates two employees to assist with ordering and dispensing medications through patient assistance programs to ensure the requests are approved. In any given week, the effort may require another 15 to 20 volunteers to meet demand.\n\n\u201cWe aren\u2019t talking about narcotics. We\u2019re talking about life-saving medications, and so many of our patients tell us they either aren\u2019t taking their medications at all because they can\u2019t afford them, or they\u2019re stretching them out by only taking something prescribed daily every third or fourth day to make them last longer,\u201d Garrett said.\n\nIn its 12th year, Victory Health Partners is modeled after the Memphis Church Health Center, and serves 25 counties in Alabama, 11 in Mississippi and eight in Florida, making it a regional facility.\n\nThe 11,000-square-foot facility at 3750 Professional Parkway in Mobile is rented from Infirmary Health System for $1 per year and employs 16, with nearly 70 volunteers providing roughly 60,000 hours of service each year.\n\nAlthough the ministry targets low-income patients, its founder and executive director, Dr. Robert Lightfoot, said it is not a free clinic, but rather pay-what-you-can for many of the clinic\u2019s 15,600 patients.\n\n\u201cIf a patient comes to Victory and is diagnosed with diabetes, we would dash their hope if we were unable to get them the necessary medication and insulin to manage their illness. By providing our patients their medications to take as prescribed by Victory\u2019s physicians, we are equipping our patients to take control of their healthcare as we come alongside them on their journey to total wellness,\u201d Lightfoot said.\n\nThat journey, he said, begins with a needs assessment of every new patient.\n\nCharges for office visits are based on what the patient can afford, be that $15 or $45, with lab and radiology services included. Patients requiring more specialized care are referred to a network of more than 150 physicians who see Victory Health patients for a reduced co-payment.\n\nThe sliding-scale approach targets low-income residents without private health insurance who do not qualify for Medicare or Medicaid, Lightfoot said. The Christian ministry is to the \u201cwhole person,\u201d also taking into consideration family size, income and other special circumstances.\n\nGarrett said Victory Health staff are happy when patients \u201cgraduate\u201d from requiring the clinic\u2019s services, but the current state of healthcare, including the passage of the Affordable Care Act, has actually contributed to a 30 percent increase in the facility\u2019s patient load since 2012.\n\nMission-oriented\n\nWhile the creation of a federal health insurance marketplace is intended to boost coverage rates for millions of U.S. residents, Garrett said the Affordable Care Act has addressed some gaps while creating others.\n\n\u201cWe encouraged all of our patients to go online, get educated and find out how (the ACA) could improve their situation, and we did lose some patients in the beginning because of it, but for so many, the options provided were still unaffordable, and the deductibles are so high,\u201d she said, adding, it\u2019s not just small and independently-owned companies affected by the changes.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing a lot of newly uninsured, and a lot of times they\u2019re employees of big businesses who get knocked down to part time and lose their benefits. They\u2019ve never been in this position before, and they have absolutely no idea where to turn,\u201d Garrett said.\n\nThe law, Garrett said, is intended to benefit the very patients Victory Health serves and, in time, should ease the burden, but the need for the clinic is expected to continue for a \u201clong, long time.\u201d\n\n\u201cHistorically, this is what the church did, took care of the sick. This is our effort to reclaim at least a small portion of the church\u2019s mission,\u201d she said.\n\nCommunity support paramount\n\nThe clinic\u2019s annual operating budget of about $1.3 million \u2013 less than half generated through patient fees \u2013 could not be attained without the support of donors. Victory Health netted $120,000 from its annual \u201cHope for Healing Celebration\u201d in April, featuring best-selling author Eric Metaxas, who penned \u201cMiracles: What They Are, Why They Happen, and How They Can Change Your Life.\u201d\n\nIn coming weeks, supporters will shift their focus to a Christmas card fundraiser and participation in the national \u201cGiving Tuesday\u201d observance after Black Friday, Small Business Saturday and Cyber Monday in the wake of Thanksgiving.\n\nGarrett said the community support is paramount because Victory Health receives no federal funds. The contributions from individuals, corporations and foundations \u2013 including $40,000 from the Alabama Power Foundation in 2013 for the purchase of a digital X-ray machine \u2013 keep the doors open.\n\nPartnerships with other nonprofits \u2013 such as cooking classes offered soon through the Bay Area Food Bank \u2013 and businesses \u2013 such as CVS providing a smoking cessation program \u2013help Victory Health\u2019s ministry, she said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in a good place to be able to support the ministry and offer a lot in the clinic for free, but those needs are always changing. It\u2019s an exciting time of growth, and we\u2019re looking to expand in the next couple of years, but we are very fortunate to be able to continue our mission of being first and foremost a ministry,\u201d Garrett said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Victory Health Partners teams up with local organizations to provide assistance to those needing help paying for prescriptions.", "og": {"site_name": "Yellowhammer News", "description": "By Kelli M.
