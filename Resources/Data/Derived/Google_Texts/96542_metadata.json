Whenever it turns to ethics, it reliably sides with the culture of death\u2013pro assisted suicide and health care rationing\u2013or against conscience rights of those who dissent from the reigning moral orthodoxy. For example, it disdains the right of medical professionals to refuse participation in abortion.\n\nNow, it has published a shallowly reasoned, follow-the-liberal-advocacy-meme article bemoaning the limited and eminently reasonable Hobby Lobby decision. From, \u201cWhen Religious Freedom Clashes with Access to Care:\u201d\n\nThe Court\u2019s decision allows the beliefs of employers of various sizes and corporate forms to trump the beliefs and needs of their employees, potentially influencing the types of care that will be affordable and accessible to individuals and permitting employers to intrude on clinician\u2013patient relationships.\n\nIt did no such thing.\n\nEmployers offer salaries for work. Part of the \u201cpackage,\u201d as it is called, often includes health insurance.\n\nEmployers have always made decisions about whether to offer this benefit and the extent of the policies offered. And no one suggested\u2013until now\u2013that they were interfering with doctor-patient relationships in the decisions they made about the kind of insurance to offer as wages.\n\nBut once the government seized centralized control over these decisions\u2013and used the cudgel of Obamacare regulations to impose the politically progressive moral view on everyone in the guise of regulating healthcare\u2013it suddenly became a right to have employers pay for certain procedures, even if the person who owns the business believes it would be sinful to so participate in the action.\n\nThat\u2019s what happens with centralized control. Government power is used to impose a preferred moral view.\n\nThen comes the NEJM hysteria:\n\nFinally, in the wake of Hobby Lobby, we may anticipate challenges to other medical services that some religions find objectionable, such as vaccinations, infertility treatments, blood transfusions, certain psychiatric treatments, and even hospice care.\n\nGood grief: What religions opposes hospice care? Christian Scientists, I suppose, because they don\u2019t believe in most medical care\u2013for themselves. I don\u2019t think CS theology considers it sinful for an employer to purchase medical insurance. Indeed, I am not sure that faith accepts the concept of sin.\n\nBut here\u2019s the larger point. The Hobby Lobby decision (and subsequent actions) restricted its terms to the HHS mandate re birth control\u2013which the editorial acknowledges.\n\nThere\u2019s a reason. Under the law, these issues must be looked at on a case-by-case basis because the Religious Freedom Restoration Act allows the government to prevail if it has a compelling interest, not to mention analyzing whether the least restrictive method was used by the government and the bona fide nature of the complainant\u2019s religious objection.\n\nHence, as I wrote at The Corner, a refusal to cover blood transfusions or inoculations for infectious disease would be looked upon more skeptically than covering medically unnecessary contraception.\n\nClick here to sign up for daily pro-life news alerts from LifeNews.com\n\nAlso, publicly traded companies like, say Chevron, will never be deemed to have a \u201creligion\u201d because they have millions of owners, thereby further limiting the potential scope of the ruling.\n\nBottom line in my book: The HHS mandate was intended to prepare the way for an eventual order for free abortion, free sex change surgery (already happening), free IVF, and perhaps, assisted suicide. One reason\u2013beyond politics\u2013for the rage is that the case throws a minor impediment in the way of using health care to transform the culture into the secular progressive image.\n\nLifeNews.com Note: Wesley J.
