Two of those, McKesson (MCK), the largest, and No. 3 AmerisourceBergen (ABC), are expanding heavily into Europe \u2014 mainly through joint partnerships.\n\nThe No. 2 player, Cardinal Health (CAH), has also been looking for new business outside the U.S., especially in China. But on Dec. 10 it announced a partnership with CVS Caremark (CVS) to form what it claims will be the largest drug-buying venture of its kind in the U.S.\n\nCombined, the three top drug wholesalers handle more than 80% of all drugs distributed in the U.S. They provide drugs to retail pharmacy chains, independent pharmacies, hospitals and nursing homes.\n\n\u201cDistributors are the most diverse players in the health-care supply chain,\u201d said analyst Eric Coldwell of Robert W. Baird & Co. \u201cThey are not reliant on specific product classes or devices. They sell across the board.\u201d\n\nBoots, Celesio And CVS\n\nAll three top drug distributors saw shares prices soar more than 60% so far in 2013. The gains hoisted the medical-wholesale drug supply group to a top 20 ranking among IBD\u2019s 197 industry groups.\n\nAmerisourceBergen was the first to deal in Europe. In March, it joined a partnership forged last year between Walgreen (WAG) and Alliance Boots, the Swiss firm that runs Boots, an international pharmacy chain. Not only did AmerisourceBergen get the nod to distribute pharmaceutical products to more than 8,000 Walgreen stores, it can buy generic drugs through a Walgreen-Alliance Boots global sourcing joint venture.\n\nMcKesson is following AmerisourceBergen into Europe with its planned $8.3 billion acquisition of German drug wholesaler Celesio, announced in late October. Total revenue for the combined company is expected to be more than $150 billion, up from $122 billion in the fiscal year ending in March. It\u2019ll add an estimated $1 to $1.20 a share to McKesson\u2019s earnings in the first year.\n\nCelesio sells drugs to customers in 13 European countries and Brazil. Plus, it runs 2,200 pharmacies in six European countries, including the U.K., where its Lloyds pharmacy chain is second only to Boots.\n\nMcKesson expects to gain full control of Celesio in the fiscal year starting in April. The plan has met some resistance from New York-based hedge fund Elliott Management, which claims McKesson\u2019s offer \u2014 at around $31.55 a share \u2014 substantially undervalues Celesio. The fund owns 25% of Stuttgart-based Celesio.\n\nIn terms of big deals, Cardinal is no longer the odd man out. In the agreement announced this month, Cardinal and CVS Caremark will form a generic-drug buying operation in the U.S., to begin in July, using their combined clout to score better pricing.\n\nThe venture will source and negotiate generic supply contracts for both Cardinal and CVS. ISI analyst Ross Muken estimates their combined generic purchasing comes to about $12 billion-$14 billion a year.\n\nHe figures Cardinal alone will save $235 million-$275 million a year, adding 25-35 cents to its earnings once the combined operation is fully up to speed.\n\nBrands Vs. Generics\n\nWholesalers generate more revenue from selling brand-name drugs than generics. But generics are more profitable. \u201cWith more purchasing volume, they can extract additional discounts from generic suppliers,\u201d said Adam Fein, president of Pembroke Consulting.\n\nPharmacies typically buy brand-name drugs from wholesalers. Smaller pharmacies also tend to buy their generic drugs from wholesalers. But larger pharmacies usually buy generic drugs directly from manufacturers. That\u2019s why small, independent pharmacies have traditionally been drug wholesalers\u2019 life blood.\n\nAmerisourceBergen\u2019s new ties with Walgreen and Alliance Boots, and now Cardinal\u2019s with CVS change that dynamic.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a big deal for AmerisourceBergen,\u201d said Fein. He says Walgreen will contribute almost $28 billion to AmerisourceBergen\u2019s revenue in fiscal 2014.\n\nThe Cardinal and CVS buying group also is viewed positively. Muken calls it \u201can unmitigated positive\u201d for Cardinal, a move that put the company back \u201con equal footing\u201d with its two rivals.\n\nIn the drug wholesaling business, revenue is not the main measure of success. Profits are, especially operating profits.\n\nColdwell expects AmerisourceBergen to show near-term EPS dilution and margin erosion from the Walgreen deal and from its recent contract win with pharmacy-benefits manager Express Scripts (ESRX), the latter of which he calls \u201cexceptionally low-margin.\u201d\n\nCardinal\u2019s loss of both customers this year led to a $3.7 billion downshift in revenue. But shedding the tight-margin agreements helped expand its gross margin to more than 5% in the last quarter, Coldwell noted.\n\nCardinal still distributes branded drugs and some back-up generics to CVS retail stores. CVS mostly self-distributes generics.\n\nObamaCare, Generic Tail Winds\n\nWholesalers buy drugs from most manufacturers. The more customers they amass, the better they are able to leverage discounts. Analysts see ObamaCare feeding the industry\u2019s leverage as more uninsured patients gain insurance coverage and access to medicines.\n\nNew health insurance enrollees from ObamaCare could add up to 1% incremental revenue growth for drug wholesalers next year and another 3% or more in 2015, Coldwell says.\n\nYet, as wholesalers, drug distributors dodge the reimbursement dynamics their customers face, where revenue and profit are sensitive to changes in health plans, budgets and health-care reform, Coldwell says.\n\nAnd unlike drug, biotech or medical-device firms, distributors aren\u2019t as dependent on a small number of products.\n\nThe flow of new generic drugs slowed this year following a huge wave that peaked in 2011 and 2012. \u201cAnother wave of generics is coming,\u201d said Coldwell. \u201cWe\u2019ve started to see a modest recovery in generic launches and that will continue to build over the next 12 months,\u201d he said.\n\nBrand-name drugs with sales of $73 billion will lose patent protection between 2013 and 2016, says Fein, who adds it\u2019s the last phase of the generic wave that started building five to 10 years ago, as brand-name drugs lost protection.\n\nAmong the many brand names going off patent next year are the MS drug Copaxone, acid-reflex drug Nexium and sleep aid Lunesta.\n\nInflation Plus Purchasing Power\n\nThen there\u2019s the specialty-drug revolution that will keep drug distributors busy and profitable, analysts say. The drug industry is shifting from traditional, pill-based medicines for large patient populations to high-priced specialty therapies targeted to rare diseases and small patient populations.\n\n\u201cWholesalers are a key part of the channel for specialty drugs administered by hospitals and outpatient departments and they have also started new specialty distribution businesses that target physician offices and clinics,\u201d Fein said.\n\nThe drugs, usually biologic in origin, often need special handling. This means higher profit margins for wholesalers dealing with them.\n\nMergers and acquisitions will also keep fueling wholesalers\u2019 growth, analysts say, along the lines of McKesson\u2019s $2 billion buy of PSS World Medical and Cardinal\u2019s $2 billion takeover of home-care products distributor AssuraMed earlier this year.\n\nCardinal has completed a number of small to midsize acquisitions of U.S. distributors, and has followed a similar course in China. Cardinal\u2019s China revenue jumped 29% in the last quarter over the earlier year, but Deutsche Bank analysts estimate that it accounts for just 2% of total revenue.\n\nAnalysts were not surprised by the latest deal from Cardinal and CVS. Prior to the announcement, Deutsche Bank analysts estimated that the McKesson-Celesio combination would give McKesson twice the generic purchasing volume of Cardinal while the AmerisourceBergen and Walgreen-Alliance Boots partnership has two-and-a-half times the purchasing volume.\n\nMeanwhile, generic drugs are fetching slightly higher prices vs. the previous deflationary pricing environment. But even with deflation, distributors are able to wrangle profits through negotiations with manufacturers.\n\n\u201cNow they have negotiation power plus inflation,\u201d Coldwell said, adding that generic prices are up in the low single digits. \u201cWe think (price inflation) will be viable well into 2014 if not beyond.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "As many of their customers brace for changes under ObamaCare, U.S. drug wholesalers are in expansion mode \u2014 heading overseas and forming purchasing co-ops", "og": {"site_name": "Investor's Business Daily", "description": "As many of their customers brace for changes under ObamaCare, U.S. drug wholesalers are in expansion mode \u2014 heading overseas and forming purchasing co-ops wherever they see fit.
