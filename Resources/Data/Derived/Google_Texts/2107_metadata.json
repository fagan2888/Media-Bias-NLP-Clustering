Based on data from 2012, 31 Florida hospitals are at risk, including three locally.\n\nDOCUMENT: Full penalty scale list of Florida hospitals (PDF)\n\n\"The differences between these hospitals and those that are not named, you know, can be very insignificant,\" said Bill Bell, General Counsel of the Florida Hospital Association.\n\nThe federal program will penalize the hospitals in the country that scored in the bottom 25 percent for patient safety.\n\nHospitals were measured on a 10-point scale and any score above a seven puts a hospital in the penalty zone. The injuries being measured include infections, falls and blood clots.\n\nLocally, the Ed Fraser Memorial Hospital in Baker County (8.95), UF Health Jacksonville (8.7) and Memorial Hospital Jacksonville (7.675) are currently over the penalty threshold.\n\n\"The hospitals' basic mission is to improve patient care,\" Bell said. \"They've already been working on that, and this is one of the best times to be a patient in healthcare today.\"\n\nA report from the federal Department of Health and Human Services says that patients have about a one-in-four chance of suffering a preventable injury at a hospital.\n\nCopyright 2014 by News4Jax.com.
