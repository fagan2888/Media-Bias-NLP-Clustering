President Vladimir Putin is expected to sign the legislation once it reaches his desk.\n\nThe proposal, using very broad language that appears open to interpretation by enforcement authorities, allows the state to ban the operations of foreign and international non-governmental organizations if it finds that they present a risk to \u201cstate security,\u201d \u201cnational defense\u201d or the maintenance of \u201cconstitutional order.\u201d\n\nRelated: Russian State Media Says U.S. Is Fomenting Riots in Macedonia\n\nIt also creates penalties for Russian groups that associate with organizations labeled as undesirable.\n\n\u201cThe intended targets of this new legislation on foreign and international organizations are actually Russian activists and Russian groups,\u201d writes Tanya Lokshina, the Russia program director for Human Rights Watch. \u201cThe bill is aimed at cutting them off from their international partners, further isolating them, and squeezing the very life out of Russian civil society.\u201d\n\nUnder Russian law, she explains, a group can be declared \u201cundesirable\u201d at the discretion of a prosecutor, with no judicial review.\n\n\u201cAn \u2018undesirable\u2019 organization must terminate its presence in Russia and stop participating in any projects on Russian territory,\u201d Lokshina writes. \u201cMoreover, it won\u2019t be able to reach out to the public through Russian media or websites \u2013 all its information will effectively be banned. And any Russian friends, partners or sympathizers of these organizations should know better than to go near them.\u201d\n\nRelated: What\u2019s Pushing Russia and China into Each Other\u2019s Arms\n\nBefore the law passed the lower house of the Russian parliament last week, John Dalhuisen, Amnesty International\u2019s director for Europe and Central Asia, said: \u201cThese new harsh restrictions are part of an ever-rising repressive tide which is stifling free speech, denying the space for debate and suffocating free expression in Russia.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cunprecedented crackdown against non-governmental organizations\u2026is effectively criminalizing lawful activity and squeezing the life out of free speech and association,\u201d he said.\n\nThe move by the Russian Parliament, which is dominated by Putin\u2019s United Russia Party, comes a week after reports surfaced that the party would be organizing vigilante squads to patrol Moscow keep public order.\n\nRoughly translated as \u201cSafe Capital\u201d and first reported on by The Moscow Times, the United Russia program is reportedly recruiting several hundred \u201cathletic\u201d young men, mostly drawn from private security firms, military associations and Russia\u2019s famed Cossacks. They will patrol the city, the paper reported, in uniforms supplied by United Russia.\n\nRelated: Putin Turns to Volunteer Vigilantes to Patrol Moscow\n\nPutin, a former KGB officer, has frequently claimed that Western intelligence agencies are using non-governmental organizations to undermine the Russian government. In a speech to the Federal Security Service in March, he warned, \"Western special services continue their attempts at using public, nongovernmental and politicized organizations to pursue their own objectives, primarily to discredit the authorities and destabilize the internal situation in Russia. They are already planning their actions for the upcoming election campaigns of 2016-18.\"\n\nThe move is just the latest effort by the Russian government to limit the ability of Russian organizations to associate with Western groups. In 2012, Putin signed a law requiring all organizations that accept grant money from international organizations to register with the government as \u201cforeign agents.\u201d\n\nLast year, the government passed a law declaring that no non-Russian company can own more than 20 percent of the shares in any Russian media organization. The law resulted in a number of foreign companies selling off their media holdings to Russian companies that were, frequently, friendly to the Kremlin.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "A new law making it illegal for Russians to associate with \u201cundesirable\u201d foreign groups is causing human rights organizations to claim that the Russian government is trying to silence its critics.", "title": "Putin Clamps Down on Russian Activists, Free Speech", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/05/21/Putin-Clamps-Down-Russian-Activists-Free-Speech", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/russia-crisis-putin-support_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/05/21/Putin-Clamps-Down-Russian-Activists-Free-Speech", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/russia-crisis-putin-support_1.jpg", "creator": "@rrgarver", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "A new law making it illegal for Russians to associate with \u201cundesirable\u201d foreign groups is causing human rights organizations to claim that the Russian government is trying to silence its critics.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0a74\"", "article_summary": "The move is just the latest effort by the Russian government to limit the ability of Russian organizations to associate with Western groups.\n\u201cMoreover, it won\u2019t be able to reach out to the public through Russian media or websites \u2013 all its information will effectively be banned.\n\u201cThe intended targets of this new legislation on foreign and international organizations are actually Russian activists and Russian groups,\u201d writes Tanya Lokshina, the Russia program director for Human Rights Watch.\nRelated: Putin Turns to Volunteer Vigilantes to Patrol MoscowPutin, a former KGB officer, has frequently claimed that Western intelligence agencies are using non-governmental organizations to undermine the Russian government.\n\u201cAn \u2018undesirable\u2019 organization must terminate its presence in Russia and stop participating in any projects on Russian territory,\u201d Lokshina writes."}
