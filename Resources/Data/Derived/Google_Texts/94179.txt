As a Christian, I have compassion for those who are truly in need. Many Alaskans fall through the cracks and need assistance. In these situations, I believe in offering a helping hand up, but not a handout. Too often, policies of that sort encourage poor behavior and a lack of self-responsibility. I support policies that require job training or work requirements for receiving benefits and getting individuals back into the workforce, rather than perpetuating a cycle of unemployment and poverty.
