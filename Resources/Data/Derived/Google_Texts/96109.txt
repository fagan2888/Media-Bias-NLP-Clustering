The aura of invincibility that Roger Ailes quickly tried to create at Fox News last week after news broke about Rupert Murdoch’s executive succession plans has now evaporated. The implications may be long lasting, not only for the cable channel, but also for the Republican Party.

Since its inception nearly 20 years ago, Ailes has ruled the Fox News fiefdom within Murdoch’s sprawling 21stCentury Fox media empire and built it into a hugely influential moneymaker. The Ailes programming fingerprint has always been omnipresent at Fox.

But now as Murdoch signals his eventual withdrawal from corporate leadership and hands the reigns over his sons, James and Lachlan, Ailes is suddenly left without his key ally and now faces a somewhat uncertain future. (Fox’s contract with Ailes, who is 75, expires next year.) The Fox boss now has to report to Murdoch’s children, both of whom he has sparred with in the past and who have reportedly signaled their distaste for Ailes’ brand of toxic programming. In previous corporate scuffles, Ailes always emerged victorious because he had Rupert’s final support.

Not anymore.

“For Ailes, it was a stinging smack-down and effectively a demotion,” wrote Ailes biographer Gabriel Sherman in New York. “Roger Ailes Burned By Murdoch Sons In Fox News Power Shift,” read the Talking Points Memo headline. (Also note that Ailes is losing another longtime corporate ally, Chase Carey, who’s resigning as chief operating officer.)
