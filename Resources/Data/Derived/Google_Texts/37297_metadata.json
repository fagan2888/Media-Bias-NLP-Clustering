The shutdown battle is being waged largely over immigration policy \u2013 even though new data suggests the U.S. public as a whole doesn\u2019t share the passion of hardcore conservatives who want to defund Obama\u2019s executive action granting up to 5 million illegal immigrants protection from deportation.\n\nA large poll released Tuesday shows that a majority of Americans favor a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants. Every state holds that view. The results of the survey released by the Washington-based Public Religion Research Institute (PRRI) suggest that on immigration in general, hardliners don\u2019t have the majority of Americans on their side. The findings are part of PRRI\u2019s larger American Values Atlas, based on a survey of 50,000 Americans and presented interactively here.\n\nRelated: McConnell Comes Up with a New Anti-Shutdown Tactic\n\nThe survey asked, \u201cHow should the immigration system deal with immigrants who are currently living in the U.S. illegally?\u201d Respondents were given three options: \u201cAllow them a way to become citizens provided they meet certain requirements,\u201d \u201cAllow them to become permanent legal resident, but not citizens,\u201d or \u201cIdentify and deport them.\u201d\n\nAcross the U.S., 77 percent of people chose either the citizenship or permanent residency option, with a majority of 60 percent choosing citizenship. Respondents from Delaware were the most receptive to the citizenship option; 66 percent chose it. Kansas and Vermont were close behind, at 65 percent. But even Wyoming, the state most resistant to the idea, still showed a majority in favor of citizenship at 52 percent with an additional nine percent choosing permanent residency.\n\nThe Republicans\u2019 stated objection to Obama\u2019s executive actions on immigration is that they were an illegal expansion of executive authority. Yet many of the most vocal supporters of using the DHS funding bill to challenge the White House, such as Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-AL) and Rep. Steve King (R-IA), are also among the most ardent supporters of tougher immigration measures.\n\nEarlier, House Republicans passed, and Senate Republicans introduced, a funding bill that would allow DHS to remain open; but it had riders withholding money to fund President Obama\u2019s executive actions shielding millions of illegal immigrants from deportation. With the shutdown now less than 72 hours away, all indications are that Republicans will pay a significant political price if no solution is found -- even if the bill is blocked by Democrats in the Senate.\n\nRelated: Terror Group\u2019s Threat to Mall of America Sharpens DHS Funding Debate\n\nIn the House, particularly, there\u2019s a substantial caucus of lawmakers that seems willing to risk the political fallout over a DHS shutdown largely on the basis of members\u2019 views on immigration. The decision last week by a federal judge in Texas to issue an injunction preventing the administration from implementing the executive orders was seen by many Republicans as a potential off-ramp that would allow them to fund DHS with no strings attached while the courts sorted out the legality of Obama\u2019s actions.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell appeared ready to take that path yesterday, proposing a vote on a \u201cclean\u201d DHS bill and another on the measures blocking the executive orders. The plan has run into stiff GOP resistance in the House.\n\nRelated: GOP Doesn\u2019t Blink on DHS Funding After Judge Bars Immigration Order\n\nInterestingly, survey respondents from the states most commonly associated with the border crisis were less likely than Americans as a whole to favor mass deportation. In Texas, 80 percent of respondents were in favor of some form of legal residence, while only 17 percent called for deporting all illegal immigrants. In Arizona and New Mexico, 18 percent of respondents picked deportation, while 79 percent and 80 percent, respectively, chose a form of legal residence.\n\nCalifornia, the only other state bordering Mexico, had 84 percent in favor of citizenship or legal residence and 14 percent in favor of deportation.\n\nThe PRRI findings on immigration don\u2019t vary wildly from other survey data. In 2013, Gallup asked a representative sample of U.S. adults if they were in favor of a program to allow illegal immigrants citizenship if they met a far more specific set of criteria than PRRI\u2019s vague \u201cmeet certain requirements\u201d language, including \u201cpaying taxes and a penalty, passing a criminal background check, and learning English.\u201d Under those circumstance, 88 percent of adults were in favor.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Even in the states most closely identified with the border crisis, a major new survey has found that large majorities of the population support allowing illegal immigrants to remain in the U.S., either as citizens or as permanent legal residents.", "title": "A Majority of Americans Favor a Path to Citizenship for Illegal Immigrants", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/02/25/Majority-Americans-Favor-Path-Citizenship-Illegal-Immigrants", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-immigration_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/02/25/Majority-Americans-Favor-Path-Citizenship-Illegal-Immigrants", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-immigration_1.jpg", "creator": "@rrgarver", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Even in the states most closely identified with the border crisis, a major new survey has found that large majorities of the population support allowing illegal immigrants to remain in the U.S., either as citizens or as permanent legal residents.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc2b4\"", "article_summary": "A large poll released Tuesday shows that a majority of Americans favor a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants.\nIn Texas, 80 percent of respondents were in favor of some form of legal residence, while only 17 percent called for deporting all illegal immigrants.\nCalifornia, the only other state bordering Mexico, had 84 percent in favor of citizenship or legal residence and 14 percent in favor of deportation.\nThe Republicans\u2019 stated objection to Obama\u2019s executive actions on immigration is that they were an illegal expansion of executive authority.\nBut even Wyoming, the state most resistant to the idea, still showed a majority in favor of citizenship at 52 percent with an additional nine percent choosing permanent residency."}
