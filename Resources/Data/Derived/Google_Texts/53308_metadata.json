However, we remain concerned that Medicare beneficiaries are unfairly shouldering more than their fair share of the cost of the SGR \u201cDoc Fix,\u201d and we urge further improvements as the bill moves to the Senate.\n\n\n\n\u201cAARP has long supported a permanent solution to the SGR so that Medicare beneficiaries can rest assured that they\u2019ll be able to continue seeing their physician each year,\u201d said AARP Executive Vice President Nancy LeaMond. \u201cWe also support the move towards greater use of quality measures and reporting and increased care coordination, among other improvements in the new physician payment formula designed to enhance value in Medicare.\u201d\n\nWhile AARP commends the House of Representatives for working together in a bipartisan fashion on this SGR bill, we are concerned that Medicare beneficiaries will now face higher out-of-pocket costs, including higher premiums and reduced coverage through certain Medicare Supplemental (Medigap) plans. The typical senior on Medigap is not wealthy\u2014nearly half have annual incomes of less than $30,000.\n\nAARP wants a permanent solution to the SGR formula, one that achieves a balanced and fair solution for all stakeholders\u2014Medicare beneficiaries, physicians and other health care providers, insurers, and drug companies. AARP is ready to work with the Senate to improve this important bill.\n\n# # #\n\nAbout AARP\n\nAARP is a nonprofit, nonpartisan organization, with a membership of nearly 38 million, that helps people turn their goals and dreams into real possibilities, strengthens communities and fights for the issues that matter most to families such as healthcare, employment and income security, retirement planning, affordable utilities and protection from financial abuse.
