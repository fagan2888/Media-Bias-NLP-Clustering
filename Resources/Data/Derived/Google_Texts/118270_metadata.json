A moderate, business-oriented Republican such as Bush might well have trouble in the primaries, but he might also have an awfully tough time in the general. The reason is that on economic policy, he\u2019s Romney redux, a Chamber-of-Commerce establishment Republican with a trickle-down agenda who will get lots of love from a business community that demonstrably doesn\u2019t determine national election outcomes.\n\nTo be clear, this isn\u2019t just a Republican problem. The CW is that the winning candidate for either side must be populist enough to get by the base but then moderate enough to both appease the corporate powers and reach the precious swing voters who decide narrow races. Note the assumption that when said candidate pivots to the middle, they\u2019ll do so while holding on to their base.\n\nI suspect this won\u2019t work. Let me explain why by starting with a 2011 op-ed co-authored by Bush wherein he (along with Kevin Marsh) articulates his \u201cgrand economic strategy\u2026in a word: growth.\u201d\n\nI\u2019ll get into some of the details as to what he thinks will drive economic growth, but let\u2019s think about this for a moment. If there\u2019s one thing anyone with even a passing interest in running for high office ought to know by now, it is that from the perspective of middle-class prosperity, growth is necessary but not sufficient.\n\nWhat Bush is really touting here is precisely the same tickle-down economics that conservatives have promoted since Ronald Reagan started talking about it in the late 1970s. Since then, the share of national income going to the top 1 percent has doubled, from about 10 percent to 20 percent, while the middle class has often struggled to claim its fair share of the growth that\u2019s occurred. This problem has been particularly pronounced in recent years, when the vast majority of the growth has eluded middle-class households.\n\nThe trickle-down platform failed for Romney, and I can\u2019t see why it won\u2019t fail again. Regardless of their partisan stripes, voters don\u2019t just want to hear your growth agenda. They want to hear what steps you\u2019re going to take to reconnect their prosperity to the growth that\u2019s occurred, or very possibly, is occurring (though, of course, their preferred solution sets will be very different).\n\nThis is another big problem for the trickle-downers, and it\u2019s a good problem to have: We\u2019ve actually got growth. Who knows what GDP will be around election time, but it may well be that a Republican like Bush arguing for growth as their \u201cgrand strategy\u201d will be stuck with that facts that a) we\u2019re already growing at a fair clip, and b) said growth got going with a Democrat at the helm.\n\nAs far as I can tell from his op-ed, Bush is for the same tax cuts that Romney ran on (\u201cfundamental tax reform \u2014 dramatically lowering tax rates for individuals and companies while eliminating loopholes, deductions and credits \u2014 is critical to economic growth\u201d), more free trade, \u201creforming Social Security,\u201d and \u201cenacting consumer-driven health-care policies,\u201d the latter two of which are typically buzzwords for reducing social insurance, including Obamacare. These are precisely the opposite policy ideas warranted by the economy in which we actually exist, where both working and retired middle-class families need stronger, not weaker, insurance against the impact of the growth disconnect on their wages, their savings and their wealth. Macroeconomic growth alone won\u2019t solve these challenges.\n\nI\u2019ll stop there on Bush because it\u2019s not fair to go much further before he\u2019s had a chance to have his say in the broader economic policy debate yet to come. But let turn briefly to the D\u2019s.\n\nHow different are they \u2014 whoever \u201cthey\u201d are \u2014 likely to be on this reconnection agenda? Surely they\u2019ll differ from the R\u2019s on minimum wages, but that\u2019s a small part of the needed agenda. In fact, too often it seems as if Democrats believe that at the end of the day, they\u2019ll survive a general based solely on the allegiance of the \u201crising American electorate:\u201d unmarried women, minorities, millennials, immigrants \u2014 the largest and fastest-growing part of the electorate.\n\nBut as the recent midterms revealed, the RAE\u2019s doesn\u2019t always show up. Its turnout may well turn out to hinge on whether it believes a candidate will try to implement a set of policies more likely to steer growth its way. Simply touting growth, as Bush\u2019s agenda clearly seems to do, is obviously inadequate. But not explaining the policies that would channel growth toward those for whom it has been a spectator sport for far too long won\u2019t work either.\n\nThose policies are not trickle-down, tax cuts for the wealthy, new trade deals or cuts to social insurance. They are instead ideas that will boost the quantity and quality of jobs; that will lower the trade deficit to promote manufacturing; that will strengthen the safety net and social insurance; that will make sure Obamacare keeps reaching the uninsured at affordable rates; that directly provide jobs for those disconnected from the job market, along with apprenticeships and other \u201cearn-while-you-learn\u201d opportunities; that will offer help to stressed households trying to balance work and family; that won\u2019t repeal but will strengthen financial market oversight.\n\nAs usual, the generals are fighting old wars. The electoral strategies seem to assume that there\u2019s some balancing act that goes left or right in the primaries and tacks to some mushy middle in the general. Perhaps I\u2019m wrong and that will work. But my hunch is that unless you\u2019ve got a strong reconnection agenda \u2014 I\u2019ve ticked off one above, but there are surely others \u2014 people will ignore you, regardless of your last name, as well they should.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The electoral generals are fighting an old war that doesn't speak to the economic reconnection agenda voters need to hear.", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "The electoral generals are fighting an old war that doesn't speak to the economic reconnection agenda voters need to hear.", "title": "Why the conventional wisdom about Jeb Bush\u2019s electability is wrong and how the D\u2019s may have the same problem.", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2014/12/22/why-the-conventional-wisdom-about-jeb-bushs-electability-is-wrong-and-how-the-ds-may-have-the-same-problem/", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2014/12/17/National-Politics/Images/2014-12-17T003721Z_01_TOR412_RTRIDSP_3_USA-POLITICS-BUSH.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@econjared"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2014/12/22/why-the-conventional-wisdom-about-jeb-bushs-electability-is-wrong-and-how-the-ds-may-have-the-same-problem/", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "Jeb Bush, election, trickle-down, tax policy, inequality, immigration,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "Jeb Bush, election, trickle-down, tax policy, inequality, immigration,"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3683\"", "article_summary": "But at least from the perspective of economic policy, I\u2019m not sure that analysis is correct.\nRegardless of their partisan stripes, voters don\u2019t just want to hear your growth agenda.\nI suspect this won\u2019t work.\nThis is another big problem for the trickle-downers, and it\u2019s a good problem to have: We\u2019ve actually got growth.\nBut not explaining the policies that would channel growth toward those for whom it has been a spectator sport for far too long won\u2019t work either."}
