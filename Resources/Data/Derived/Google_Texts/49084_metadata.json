(AP) \u2014 By Roy Williams\u2019 own admission, it\u2019s been a tough season for North Carolina.\n\nThe death of coach Dean Smith, an academic scandal that raised questions about whether the Tar Heels have lost their way off the court, and a poor record \u2014 at least by Carolina\u2019s standards \u2014 have made it hard.\n\nHeading back to the Sweet 16 of the NCAA Tournament gives the coach and his players something to savor.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m an emotional guy. \u2026 Losing Coach Smith, losing Ted Seagroves, my big-time buddy, Stuart Scott, the stuff that we\u2019ve had going on, Mitch Kupchak\u2019s daughter, it\u2019s been a hard year, it really has,\u201d Williams said after Saturday night\u2019s 87-78 victory over fifth-seeded Arkansas. \u201cI probably acted sillier in the locker room after this game than I have in quite a while. I\u2019m going to try to enjoy the dickens out of this one for a while.\u201d\n\nThe fourth-seeded Tar Heels (26-11) head to Los Angeles for the West Regional semifinals, where they\u2019ll play either top-seeded Wisconsin or No. 8 seed Oregon.\n\nSixth-seed Xavier also advanced from Jacksonville, making it to the Sweet 16 for the third time in six years and ending the biggest feel-good story of the tourney with a 75-67 win over Georgia State. The Musketeers will face No. 2 seed Arizona in Los Angeles.\n\nIt will be a cross-country trip for the Tar Heels, somewhat fitting given their path this season.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t have the type of regular season we wanted to,\u201d said Tar Heels star Marcus Paige, who scored a team-high 22 points against Arkansas. \u201cWe had some bumps in the road, and we weren\u2019t a typical Carolina team in terms of our record this year and our seed and stuff.\n\n\u201cOur fans expect us to have a No. 1 seed overall every single year. Unfortunately it didn\u2019t happen for us this year, but we understand the moment, and you\u2019ve got to win six games. Once you\u2019re slotted in the tournament and you\u2019re in position, it\u2019s up for grabs. And we knew that we had the talent, we had the capability, we just have to buy in and do what we\u2019re told, and we\u2019ve been playing a lot better. Even if we have a bad regular season by Carolina standards, you can make up some ground for that by playing well in the tournament and making things happen late in the season.\u201d\n\nAside from Carolina advancing to the Sweet 16 for the first time in three years, here are some things to know about Saturday\u2019s West Region matchups in Jacksonville:", "article_metadata": {"description": "North Carolina, Xavier back in NCAA Sweet 16", "title": "North Carolina, Xavier back in NCAA Sweet 16", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "North Carolina, Xavier back in NCAA Sweet 16", "title": "North Carolina, Xavier back in NCAA Sweet 16", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/03/22/north_carolina_xavier_back_in_ncaa_sweet_16/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/03/ncaa-arkansas-north-carolina-basketball.jpeg8-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "North Carolina, Xavier back in NCAA Sweet 16", "title": "North Carolina, Xavier back in NCAA Sweet 16", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/03/ncaa-arkansas-north-carolina-basketball.jpeg8-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Fred Goodall", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd431\"", "article_summary": "Heading back to the Sweet 16 of the NCAA Tournament gives the coach and his players something to savor.\nSixth-seed Xavier also advanced from Jacksonville, making it to the Sweet 16 for the third time in six years and ending the biggest feel-good story of the tourney with a 75-67 win over Georgia State.\nTopics: From the Wires, Entertainment News, NewsJACKSONVILLE, Fla.
