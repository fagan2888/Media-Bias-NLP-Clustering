With the killer denying ever raping Range, the semen\u2019s owner remained a mystery for nearly 30 years. Eventually, the semen was identified as belonging to Kenneth Douglas, an assistant working in an Ohio morgue. In a gruesome unfolding of events, it was revealed that Range was only one of at least 100 corpses sexually abused by Douglas in the 16 years he worked at the Hamilton County morgue.\n\nThe onset of modern technology allowed investigators to identify the origin of sperm found in the 1982 murder victim. Upon learning the identity of Range\u2019s abuser, the 19-year-old victim\u2019s family sued Douglas. Two more sexually abused corpses were subsequently linked to 60-year-old Douglas, but it wasn\u2019t until his recent disposition that the former morgue assistant admitted to having sex with \u201cup to 100 bodies,\u201d WCOP reported. According to Douglas, he would \u201cjust get on top of them and pull my pants down,\u201d after he had imbibed crack or alcohol before going to work. \"If I hadn't had anything to drink when I went to work, it wouldn't happen,\" Douglas said.\n\nThe attorney for one of the victim\u2019s families, Al Gerhardstien, claimed that Hamilton County had plenty of notice that Douglas was committing such heinous acts, but instead chose to turn a blind eye. Despite it being apparent that for years Douglas had been abusing drugs or alcohol before or during work, Douglas\u2019 wife claims that she had even called the morgue supervisor, complaining that her husband was coming home from his job smelling of sex and alcohol. \"He said, 'Whatever happens on county time and on county property is county business,'\" Douglas\u2019 wife recalled the supervisors saying in reply to her concerns.\n\nCurrently, Douglas is only being tried for the sexual abuse of three corpses, of which his DNA has been linked to: 23-year-old Charlene Appling, who died in 1991 after being strangled during her sixth-month of pregnancy; 24-year-old April Hicks, who fell from a third-story window in 1991 and died of blunt force trauma; and Range, who was nearly decapitated by a door-to-door salesman in 1982, Gawker reported. Douglas admitted to having sex with these corpses and more while they were kept in storage awaiting autopsies.\n\nNecrophilia is an erotic attraction to corpses, thought to be motivated by the attempt to gain possession of an unresisting or nonrejecting partner, according to Crime Library. Necrophiles are commonly diagnosed with having a personality disorder, but about 10 percent are described as being psychotic. The practice has been observed throughout history, with Egyptian men recorded as waiting until decomposition had set in before giving their wives to embalmers, to help dissuade the frowned upon practice, Stephen J. Hucker, a consultant psychiatrist wrote in Forensic Psychiatry. Due to the large amount of privacy surrounding the taboo practice, it is believed that necrophilia may be more prevalent than statistically shown.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "necrophilia, obsessed, morgue, assistant, kenneth, douglas, admitted, sexually, abusing, 100", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "An Ohio morgue assistant on trial for sexually abusing three cadavers admits to having sex with up to 100 corpses during the 16 years he worked at the Hamilton County morgue.", "title": "Morgue Assistant Admits To Having Sex With Up To 100 Corpses During Crack And Alcohol Binges [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/necrophilia-obsessed-morgue-assistant-kenneth-douglas-admitted-sexually-abusing-100-298486", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/18/ken_0.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "An Ohio morgue assistant on trial for sexually abusing three cadavers admits to having sex with up to 100 corpses during the 16 years he worked at the Hamilton County morgue.", "title": "Morgue Assistant Admits To Having Sex With Up To 100 Corpses During Crack And Alcohol Binges [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/necrophilia-obsessed-morgue-assistant-kenneth-douglas-admitted-sexually-abusing-100-298486", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/18/ken_0.png", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/18/ken_0.png"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Conditions", "published_time": "2014-08-18T12:44:10-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-08-18T13:58:21-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "An Ohio morgue assistant on trial for sexually abusing three cadavers admits to having sex with up to 100 corpses during the 16 years he worked at the Hamilton County morgue."}, "article_summary": "Douglas admitted to having sex with these corpses and more while they were kept in storage awaiting autopsies.\nEventually, the semen was identified as belonging to Kenneth Douglas, an assistant working in an Ohio morgue.\nTwo more sexually abused corpses were subsequently linked to 60-year-old Douglas, but it wasn\u2019t until his recent disposition that the former morgue assistant admitted to having sex with \u201cup to 100 bodies,\u201d WCOP reported.\n\"He said, 'Whatever happens on county time and on county property is county business,'\" Douglas\u2019 wife recalled the supervisors saying in reply to her concerns.\nIn a gruesome unfolding of events, it was revealed that Range was only one of at least 100 corpses sexually abused by Douglas in the 16 years he worked at the Hamilton County morgue."}
