Bruce Rauner\u2019s recent suspension of state grants for Illinois\u2019 10 immigrant welcoming centers.\n\nDesignated just last summer as an Illinois Welcoming Center, the Spanish Community Center, 309 N. Eastern Ave. in Joliet, won\u2019t receive the more than $70,000 in grant funding owed through this fiscal year, which ends June 30, according to center Executive Director Elizabeth Nevarez.\n\nThe money was included in the budget fix legislation approved and signed by Rauner last month. Then, on April 3, Nevarez and other welcome center officials were notified the funding would instead be suspended, effective immediately.\n\n\u201cThere is an inconsistency here,\u201d Nevarez said.\n\nImmigration has made the United States a great country, Rauner spokeswoman Catherine Kelly said in an emailed statement Friday. But the previous administration enacted a budget with a $1.6 billion budget hole that needs closure.\n\n\u201cThe bipartisan legislation passed by the General Assembly is not a complete solution, and the administration\u2019s ability to manage the budget is restricted by the legislation as well as the time it took to pass,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cPart of the solution to solving the inherited $1.6 billion budget hole without raising taxes or increasing borrowing is to continue to evaluate the current fiscal year\u2019s budget.\u201d\n\nThe drastic state budget reductions also mean the city\u2019s growing Hispanic population \u2013 and others \u2013 will have a harder time successfully integrating into Illinois through services offered at the Joliet center, which is already strapped for cash, Nevarez said.\n\nWelcoming centers help immigrant and refugee individuals as well as families assimilate in Illinois, offering services and information they need.\n\nThe centers are meant to eliminate barriers people from out of state encounter when accessing those services.\n\nNevarez said she may need to layoff two of her five staff members next month because she can\u2019t afford salaries. Services may also have to be cut.\n\n\u201cThe other impact is on the people we serve. That\u2019s the bottom line. These are services that we are providing to the residents in the community they could otherwise not access with the language barrier,\u201d Nevarez said.\n\nThe center enrolled about 1,000 people last year in health care coverage under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe center also helps people gain access to employment counseling, unemployment insurance, Medicaid, food stamps and health screenings.\n\nWhile the Spanish Community Center serves everyone, most of its clientele is Latino. About 70 percent of the center\u2019s clientele is Latino, 25 percent black and 5 percent white, according to the center.", "article_metadata": {"copyright": "2016 The Herald-News", "og": {"url": "http://www.theherald-news.com/2015/04/17/grant-funding-suspended-for-spanish-community-center-in-joliet/ayig3a8/", "image": "http://www.theherald-news.com/_internal/cimg!0/rz8o7p9kzi3lgzg0x5cd7qt9tecrwxe", "site_name": "The Herald-News", "description": "JOLIET \u2013 Program reductions and layoffs are on the horizon at Joliet\u2019s Spanish Community Center following news of Gov.
