After saying that she thinks Obama will put a moderate nominee on the Supreme Court, “It’s almost like they’re [Senate Republicans] not being patriotic, it seems to me. … And I have to say it, I know it’s not popular to say it, but his color has something to do with it. I don’t care.”

She added, “I’m saying that they’re racists, and it takes a white person to say it. Because everybody knows black people believe that.”
