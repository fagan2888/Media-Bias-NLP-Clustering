"I know him to be a principled and good-natured man. Although I am very excited for the new challenge with Third Dimension Strategies, I am going to miss the day-to-day fight for freedom with Team Paul."

Prior to working for Paul's office, Darling spent seven years at conservative think tank The Heritage Foundation as a senior fellow and director of government and state relations.
