He then stole $14,000 in cash and a gun from behind the register before fleeing the scene.\n\nSmallwood was convicted of these charges in 2009 and sentenced to 65 years in prison. His case was later reversed on appeal due to evidence allowed at trial.\n\nSmallwood now faces up to life in prison for this conviction. He will be sentenced the week of Dec. 11, according to the State Attorney's Office.\n\nCopyright 2014 by News4Jax.com. All rights reserved.
