Four years later, he defeated Mitt Romney in a campaign that, except for one dismal debate performance, proved Obama to be a pitch-perfect candidate. But despite these impressive political accomplishments, the president seems to have been having trouble governing over the past 12 months.\n\nOn foreign policy, the Obama administration showed its indecisiveness when dealing with the unfolding political debacle in Syria. The rollout of the Affordable Care Act could not have been more botched. And in November, with little fanfare, the Environmental Protection Agency made a move that stunned the environmental community \u2014 and sent shock waves through Washington \u2014 when it made a 180-degree shift on the White House\u2019s long-held position on renewable fuels.\n\nHistorically, Obama has supported biofuels. In 2005, as the senator from Illinois, he voted for the bipartisan Energy Policy Act, which established the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) and required that renewable fuels be blended into the national fuel supply to reduce the consumption of conventional gasoline and diesel. In 2007, Obama voted for a follow-up bill that set the mandated amounts of renewable fuels to be used, increasing from 9 billion gallons in 2008 to 36 billion gallons in 2022.\n\nIn particular, Obama was a champion of biodiesel, which is designated as an \u201cadvanced\u201d biofuel by the EPA. Biodiesel burns cleaner than diesel, creating fewer greenhouse gas emissions. It also can be made from an array of renewable sources, even waste products such as recycled cooking oil. Obama showed his support for biodiesel while he was campaigning for president in 2008 when he and running mate Joe Biden toured a biodiesel plant in Beaver County, Pennsylvania. Then, in 2011, as president, Obama made sure his \u201cBlueprint for a Secure Energy Future\u201d contained provisions to promote biodiesel.\n\nObama\u2019s support for biofuels continued into 2013. In February, Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack detailed the administration\u2019s commitment to biofuels. \u201cOur position,\u201d he said in a press briefing, \u201cis that we are strong supporters of the RFS. It\u2019s working. It\u2019s doing what it\u2019s supposed to do. We would hope Congress will continue to allow it to work.\u201d\n\nIn August, the EPA announced the continuation of expected RFS mandates. The decision prompted Sen. David Vitter, R-La., to demand that the Obama administration not just reconsider RFS guidelines, something that opponents of RFS including Big Oil have suggested, but to end the mandates altogether.\n\nThe Obama administration ignored critics like Vitter \u2014 until it pulled an about-face. On November 15, out of the blue, the EPA announced its intention to slash RFS mandates, cutting the amount of renewable fuel for 2014 to 15 billion gallons, down from the 16 billion required in 2013 and the 18 billion demanded by the RFS mandates established in 2007. This represented an almost 20 percent reduction in mandated use of biofuels, the first time the law had been softened since the original bill passed in 2005 during the administration of George W. Bush. Even more shockingly, biodiesel, the only advanced biofuel produced on a national scale, was cut almost 50 percent by some estimates.\n\nProponents of biofuels were stunned. Rep. Bruce Braley, D-Iowa, was equally harsh. In a stinging letter to the president, Braley, who was \u201cangered and frustrated,\u201d argued that the reversal amounted to an \u201cunprecedented pivot\u201d from previous policy that would harm the economy in general and the biofuel industry in particular. \u201cI\u2019m stunned,\u201d he wrote, \u201cthat the White House is caving to Big Oil.\u201d\n\nFormer Rep. Ronnie Shows, D-Miss., saw the reversal as a potential political blunder. \u201cThe biodiesel announcement,\u201d Shows wrote in an op-ed, \u201cwas puzzling because the president has stated for years that advanced biofuels, such as biodiesel, are a critical component of this nation\u2019s fuel supply.\u201d The flip-flop reveals an administration that is \u201cindecisive,\u201d which could prove disastrous for the Democratic Party in the upcoming midterm election.\n\nOn that point, beyond the pundits, the television commentators, and the president himself, the final arbiter on whether the Obama administration is up to the task of governing will be the American voters themselves \u2014 when they go to the polls in November.\n\nPaul Alexander is the author of Machiavelli\u2019s Shadow: The Rise and Fall of Karl Rove.
