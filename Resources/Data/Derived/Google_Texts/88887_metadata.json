Bush and John Kerry, and for good reasons. It was the post-9/11 election, with each candidate trying to out-pander and out-patriot the other: Remember Kerry snapping off a salute to the Democratic convention and announcing that he was \u201creporting for duty\u201d? I hope not. Bush was re-elected \u2014 if we accept the fiction that he had ever been elected in the first place \u2014 even though his war in Iraq went badly south that year and the neocon dream of a Pax Americana across the Middle East was clearly falling apart. Indeed, 2004 gave us the only presidential election in the last six in which the Republican candidate won the popular vote.\n\nThat campaign lacked the drama of the \u201changing chad\u201d stolen election of 2000 or the post-crash Obama landslide of 2008 (although that one also feels like a generation ago). In keeping with the supposed mood of shared trauma and national comity, the two candidates affected not to dislike each other, and expressed their policy differences only in the context of their boundless and unquestioned love for America. But Mary Mapes has not forgotten that election, and neither has Dan Rather. Painful as all of this is to recall, there are reasons we should not forget it either.\n\nMapes was the CBS News producer who put together Rather\u2019s infamous September 2004 report on \u201c60 Minutes\u201d about George W. Bush\u2019s dubious service record in the Texas Air National Guard, a glamorous flyboy unit that played host in the late \u201960s and early \u201970s to numerous scions of prominent Lone Star State families who were less than eager to serve in Vietnam. After the story became the focus of a furious Internet-based right-wing counterattack over the disputed authenticity of two documents, which were not essential to the overall case, Rather was forced to resign as anchor of the \u201cCBS Evening News\u201d and Mapes was fired, along with several other executives and producers. (She never worked in TV journalism again.) When paired with the third-party \u201cSwift Boat ads\u201d attacking John Kerry\u2019s record of actual service in Vietnam (and his actual war injuries), Rathergate announced the advent of a new form of Republican political black magic, which could distort reality so severely that truth became lies and lies became truth.\n\nJames Vanderbilt\u2019s tendentious docudrama \u201cTruth,\u201d which stars Cate Blanchett as Mapes and Robert Redford as Rather, is not a particularly good movie. It\u2019s full of plucky newsroom banter, colorful Texas coots and craven corporate suits yelling at people. Blanchett uses essentially the same upper-crust American accent that won her an Oscar in \u201cBlue Jasmine\u201d to play Mapes, who grew up in modest circumstances in the Pacific Northwest. Redford, who has never played anything except the \u201cRobert Redford role,\u201d doesn\u2019t look or sound anything like Dan Rather. But along the way, \u201cTruth\u201d makes the point that when right-wing operatives (in this case Karl Rove, Bush\u2019s Gollum-like strategist) discovered that they could topple America\u2019s most venerated newsman over sloppy reporting shortcuts in a story whose basic facts were not in dispute, then or now, a Rubicon had been crossed.\n\nWhether Rathergate actually won that election for Bush is debatable; in the great Democratic middle-road milquetoast tradition of Al Gore and Michael Dukakis, the dithery, soporific Kerry campaign did everything it could to ensure defeat. But that whole episode clearly boosted Republican morale and made Rove and his minions feel that they were in control of the narrative and had the power to transform any possible negative into a positive. Rathergate was certainly not the first counterfactual counterattack strategy in American political history, and was not quite the birth of the right-wing blogosphere (which had surfaced, in embryonic form, during the Clinton years), but it marked a crucial evolution on both fronts. From 2004 flowed many blessings, at least for those who sought to control political discourse and popular perception and in so doing alter the nature of reality.\n\nSuddenly all things were possible, and America became an endless episode of \u201cThe X-Files,\u201d brought to you by faceless men in nice suits who are eager to warn you about the ravages of government and the duplicity of the \u201cliberal media.\u201d Every delirious resistance hypothesis previously promulgated by retired pharmacists who hand out mimeographed screeds in the mall now became a conduit for sowing widespread bewilderment and disempowerment. Climate-change denialism and birth-certificate trutherism. Death panels. Benghazi and Planned Parenthood. Every single aspect of what was once Tea Party ideology and has now become Republican orthodoxy, especially the upside-down economics in which high taxes (which are at historic lows) and social spending (which has been slashed) are reducing Americans to poverty and misery, rather than, let\u2019s just say, a pointless $4 trillion war or the intensifying concentration of wealth at the very top of the pyramid.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Long before Benghazi and Planned Parenthood, Karl Rove toppled Dan Rather, gutted CBS and proclaimed lies as truth", "title": "Rathergate and the dark magic of 2004: When the GOP learned how to subvert truth and alter political reality", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Long before Benghazi and Planned Parenthood, Karl Rove toppled Dan Rather, gutted CBS and proclaimed lies as truth", "title": "Rathergate and the dark magic of 2004: When the GOP learned how to subvert truth and alter political reality", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/10/17/rathergate_and_the_dark_magic_of_2004_when_the_gop_learned_how_to_subvert_truth_and_alter_political_reality/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/10/rather_redford.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Long before Benghazi and Planned Parenthood, Karl Rove toppled Dan Rather, gutted CBS and proclaimed lies as truth", "title": "Rathergate and the dark magic of 2004: When the GOP learned how to subvert truth and alter political reality", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/10/rather_redford.jpg", "creator": "@andohehir", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Andrew O'Hehir", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, 2004 Elections, aol_on, cate blanchett, CBS, cbs news, Dan Rather, Editor's Picks, George W.
