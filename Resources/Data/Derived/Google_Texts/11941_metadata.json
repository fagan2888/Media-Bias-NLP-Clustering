Lucy Nicholson/Reuters\n\nThe government shutdown has forced an elderly couple out of their Lake Mead, Nev., home \u2013 because it sits on federal land.\n\nRalph and Joyce Spencer, 80 and 77 respectively, drove into town for supplies last Wednesday and on their way back they found two rangers blocking their way. They were given less than 24 hours to pack their things, after which, the road would be barricaded.\n\n\u201cOne of the rangers, a guy that we know, he said \u2018I\u2019m really sorry to tell you this but you have to move out, you have to leave,\u2019\u201d Joyce Spencer told Al Jazeera.\n\nThe Spencers have owned the house since the 1970s and run an ice cream shop in nearby Overton, Nevada. Joyce said the ranger who gave them the news is a \"good guy\" who comes into the ice cream shop all the time.\n\n\u201cThey said it\u2019s just like in 1995 during the last government shut down and I said they didn\u2019t do any of that,\u201d Joyce said.\n\nThe Spencers\u2019 property is classified as a vacation cabin, and they pay a yearly lease on the land that goes to the national recreation area because the property sits near Lake Mead. Joyce told Al Jazeera there is a clause in the contract that says it can\u2019t be a permanent residence, and they usually stay there \u201cabout half of the time.\u201d\n\nWhile Joyce says she\u2019s not mad, she told Al Jazeera that the experience has been frustrating and inconvenient, \u201cThe lot\u2019s ours and we own it -- we have a right to be there.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The two found their road blocked and rangers who said they could not return because the house sits on federal land.", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=810543104, affiliate-data=10lxKx", "og": {"url": "http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2013/10/7/shutdown-forces-elderlycouplefromlakemeadhome.html", "image": {"width": 960, "identifier": "http://america.aljazeera.com/content/ajam/articles/2013/10/7/shutdown-forces-elderlycouplefromlakemeadhome/jcr:content/mainpar/adaptiveimage/src.adapt.960.high.government_shutdown_100713.1381171743387.jpg", "height": 600}, "type": "article", "description": "The two found their road blocked and rangers who said they could not return because the house sits on federal land.", "title": "Government shutdown forces elderly couple from Nevada home"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://america.aljazeera.com/content/ajam/articles/2013/10/7/shutdown-forces-elderlycouplefromlakemeadhome/jcr:content/mainpar/adaptiveimage/src.adapt.960.high.government_shutdown_100713.1381171743387.jpg", "title": "Government shutdown forces elderly couple from Nevada home", "site": "@AJAM", "card": "summary", "description": "The two found their road blocked and rangers who said they could not return because the house sits on federal land."}, "google-play-app": "app-id=com.aljazeera.simple", "keywords": "Debt Ceiling, Shutdown, Politics, Nevada, Senior Citizens, Deficit, Small Town America, Elderly, Obamacare, U.S.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9eff\"", "article_summary": "Lucy Nicholson/ReutersThe government shutdown has forced an elderly couple out of their Lake Mead, Nev., home \u2013 because it sits on federal land.\nThe Spencers have owned the house since the 1970s and run an ice cream shop in nearby Overton, Nevada.\nRalph and Joyce Spencer, 80 and 77 respectively, drove into town for supplies last Wednesday and on their way back they found two rangers blocking their way.\nThe congressional impasse over the Affordable Care Act caused a federal government shutdown that closed every park, monument, and battlefield under its jurisdiction.\n\u201cOne of the rangers, a guy that we know, he said \u2018I\u2019m really sorry to tell you this but you have to move out, you have to leave,\u2019\u201d Joyce Spencer told Al Jazeera."}
