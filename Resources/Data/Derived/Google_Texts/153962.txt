An Iranian Christian has been released from prison after winning an appeal hearing for a 10-year prison sentenced issue back in July.

Mostafa Bordbar has been released after three months in Evin Prison on charges of being part of an “anti-security organization,” and “gathering with intent to commit crimes against Iranian national security,” says human rights organization Christian Solidarity Worldwide (CSW).

Bordbar was cleared of all charges on October 30 after being arrested with 50 other Christian converts who had gathered to celebrate Christmas in Tehran.

After an investigation of Facebook and email accounts, the man and Vruir Avanessian, an Armenian-Christian pastor, were arrested. Avanessian was “temporarily” released on January 10 after posting bail of $60,000.

Abdolfattah Soltani, the prominent Iranian human rights lawyer who started a hunger strike on Nov. 2, has been moved from Evin Prison, although the details of his whereabouts are unknown.

Soltani began the hunger strike on his 60th birthday to protest the lack of medical care given to fellow prisoners, despite suffering from serious digestive and stomach complications himself.

Soltani was arrested in September 2011 on charges of “being awarded the (2009) Nuremberg International Human Rights Award”, “interviewing with media about his clients’ cases,” and “co-founding the Defenders of Human Rights Center.”
