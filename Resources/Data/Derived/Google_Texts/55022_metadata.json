She had every intention of buying new, subsidized coverage under the health law in October.\n\n\u201cThen obviously I heard all the coverage about how terrible the website was,\u201d said Bunnen, 26, a George Washington University grad student who lives in Virginia. \u201cAnd I said, OK I\u2019ll wait. And I kept waiting. And November came around and the website was still terrible. And I was going to do it over Thanksgiving.\u201d\n\nBut she didn\u2019t.\n\nThe success of the Affordable Care Act\u2019s online marketplaces may depend on people like Lizzie Bunnen.\n\nIf healthy adults her age don\u2019t sign up, the risk is that predominantly older and sicker members will drive up costs and threaten the portals\u2019 future. With the Dec. 23 deadline approaching for January coverage, and at the end of March for all 2014 enrollment, the clock is ticking on what many believe is one of the health law\u2019s biggest challenges.\n\nAs a result, ACA backers have stepped up efforts to persuade Bunnen and others aged 18 to their mid-30s to give Obamacare a second chance on newly improved websites such as healthcare.gov.\n\n\u201cRemind your friends and your peers \u2014 imagine what happens if you get sick, what happens with the massive bills\u201d if there\u2019s no health insurance, President Obama told a group of young people at the White House this month.\n\nThe president called on radio hosts and bartenders to publicize Obamacare. First Lady Michelle Obama wants families to talk to loved ones \u201cabout what health care reform can mean to them\u201d over the holidays.\n\nYoung Invincibles, a healthcare consumer group, would like young adults to ask for Obamacare for a holiday gift.\n\nThe Colorado Consumer Health Initiative invokes pregnancy, bike crashes, ski injuries and handstands on beer kegs as reasons for young adults to buy coverage.\n\nHealth law supporters also lined up Adam Levine \u2014 Maroon 5 frontman and People magazine\u2019s Sexiest Man Alive \u2014 to urge young folks to get insured.\n\nStill, a poll released Dec. 4 by Harvard University\u2019s Institute of Politics suggested the recruitment challenge is substantial. More than half of the uninsured young adults who responded disapproved of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nOnly 20% said they would \u201cdefinitely\u201d or \u201cprobably\u201d sign up.\n\n\u201cI personally haven\u2019t been on Covered California,\u201d that state\u2019s website for enrolling in the new coverage, said Jasun Boles, 32, a California construction worker. \u201cAs I\u2019m listening to the news they\u2019re saying, whoa, the online thing isn\u2019t working. If you enter your personal information, it might be stolen. I\u2019m thinking I\u2019m just going to wait.\u201d\n\nFew numbers have been published on enrollees\u2019 ages so far. California has said 21% of those who signed up through early December are between the ages of 18 and 34 while Kentucky reports that about 20% of those buying plans through late November are in the same category.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s still a little bit too early to tell\u201d how the balance will turn out, said Peter Cunningham, a senior fellow at the nonprofit Center for Studying Health System Change. \u201cThe California experience is probably better than what a lot of people expected and maybe as good as we can expect\u201d in the first year.\n\nIf total signups meet expectations across the country, the White House figures nearly 40% of enrollees will be in that category. But the Department of Health and Human Services hasn\u2019t published age breakdowns for enrollees in healthcare.gov, the troubled online marketplace it is running for 36 states.\n\nEven though older subscribers pay substantially more in premiums and the health law contains \u201creinsurance\u201d and other safety valves for plans that lose money in the early years, some believe disproportionate enrollment of older and sicker people could drive up premiums and threaten the policies\u2019 long-term stability.\n\nWhile December enrollment will probably rise with a better functioning site, \u201cat this juncture it seems unlikely that the administration will meet its goals for young adult enrollment,\u201d said Conor Ryan, a health data analyst with the American Action Forum, a right-leaning think tank.\n\nNew York singer and actress Gabrielle Sterbenz waited until finishing a tour of Britain and Ireland in October to enroll recently on New York\u2019s insurance portal to replace what she called \u201cminimal\u201d coverage now.\n\nAfter subsidies she\u2019s paying $60 a month for a medium-level silver plan, she said.\n\n\u201cThe New York site is great,\u201d said Sterbenz, 36. \u201cI\u2019m getting full coverage. I found a plan that my voice doctor is on and my regular primary care [doctor] and my ob-gyn \u2014 and I\u2019m paying less,\u201d thanks to the health law\u2019s tax credits. \u201cI know actors and musicians who have been looking forward to Obamacare kicking in.\u201d\n\nNew York\u2019s online exchange has been praised along with California\u2019s and Kentucky\u2019s as working relatively well. As the federal portal and other troubled sites such as Maryland\u2019s improve, the portion of younger, healthier applicants should grow, suggests Timothy Jost, a law professor and health policy specialist at Washington and Lee University.\n\n\u201cIt seems to me that a person who really needs health insurance will spend a day trying to enroll,\u201d Web problems or not, Jost said. \u201cA healthy person will probably wait until he or she can enroll in 20 minutes.\u201d\n\nTravis Hoium, 31, a contract writer for The Motley Fool financial site was able to sign up on MNsure, Minnesota\u2019s troubled portal. \u201cThe signup was pretty painless,\u201d he said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say that it was anything harder than signing up for anything similar online.\u201d\n\nIneligible for subsidies, he enrolled in a high-benefit gold plan for $165 a month, he said.\n\nEven perfect software was unlikely to persuade Kerry Haack, 31, a homemaker in Lewisville, Idaho, to enroll in a plan created by the health law.\n\n\u201cThe government\u2019s role is not to tell people that they need to buy health insurance,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a wrongheaded law, and I\u2019m opposed to [Idaho] implementing it.\u201d\n\nWhile she lacks coverage now, her recently graduated husband expects to take a job offering a family health plan next year, which she\u2019ll sign up for, she said.\n\nNor will California\u2019s Jasun Boles probably sign up this month, he said.\n\nEven if he gets hurt and racks up a $20,000 emergency room bill, he figures that\u2019s affordable next to the $70,000 he already owes in student debt.\n\nHe realizes under the health law he\u2019ll pay a penalty if he lacks coverage. (Next year it\u2019s $95 or 1% of income.) But, he said, \u201cit\u2019s cheaper for me to pay that once rather than pay the full price of health care for the first year.\u201d\n\nHaving missed her Thanksgiving-break chance to sign up, Lizzie Bunnen was going to get it done in early December. Then finals got in the way. Then travel.\n\nShe finally enrolled in a gold plan on healthcare.gov without \u201ctoo much difficulty,\u201d she said. But she didn\u2019t immediately get a confirming email from either the portal or the insurer.\n\n\u201cSo I\u2019m concerned that my application never actually made it\u201d to the insurance company, she said.\n\nJay Hancock writes for Kaiser Health News, an editorially independent program of the Henry J.
