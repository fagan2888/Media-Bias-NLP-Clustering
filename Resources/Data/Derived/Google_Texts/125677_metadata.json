Really, truly.\n\nNot because he just won his second National League Cy Young Award in the last three years. Not because his 1.83 ERA this past season was the lowest in baseball since 2000. Not because he\u2019s always been a gentleman with me and the rest of the media when he\u2019s wearing Dodger blue.\n\nKershaw is one of the good guys because of this: Last year, he won Major League Baseball\u2019s Roberto Clemente Award. The award is MLB\u2019s most prestigious humanitarian award, presented annually to a player who demonstrates the values the great Clemente displayed in his commitment to community and understanding the value of helping others.\n\nSaturday night, Kershaw was in Denver to receive another prestigious award: The Branch Rickey Award \u2014 for service above self \u2014 presented by the Rotary Club of Denver. Kershaw became the 22nd major leaguer to enter the Baseball Humanitarians Hall of Fame.\n\n\u201cNo matter what was going to happen with his career, both Clayton and I knew that we wanted to give back,\u201d\n\nhis wife, Ellen, said. \u201cIt\u2019s always been part of the fabric of who Clayton is. He doesn\u2019t do this sort of thing to get honored. Actually, it\u2019s kind of funny, because he\u2019s so humble, but being in baseball puts him in the spotlight. He\u2019s learned to handle it and put the focus on kids he\u2019s helping and our charities.\u201d\n\nBefore Saturday night\u2019s banquet, Kershaw, dressed casually in jeans and a floppy T-shirt, met with a group of kids from the Denver Public Schools. Kershaw was soft-spoken and genuinely interested in interacting with the kids.\n\n\u201cWe said it last year with the Roberto Clemente Award. It really is a special thing for us, not only for myself but for my wife, because this is kind of her full-time job,\u201d Kershaw said. \u201cIt really is special and more than anything it\u2019s just great recognition for the different charities we\u2019re helping out on. It\u2019s really bringing a bigger platform for us and for them, to help more kids. It\u2019s kind of what it\u2019s all about.\u201d\n\nSo what have the Kershaws done in their early 20s? They started Kershaw\u2019s Challenge, a foundation\n\nthat seeks to transform the lives of at-risk children and communities.\n\nTheir cornerstone charity, \u201cArise Africa,\u201d has built and sustained an orphanage in Lusaka, Zambia called \u201cArise Home.\u201d They are leaving for Zambia on Wednesday.\n\nThe orphanage is now home to nine children who came from desperate situations. This year, their goal is to rebuild a community school in the heart of Lusaka, adding five additional classrooms and paying salaries for higher educated faculty. They are also drilling a new water well to bring fresh water to the town. Each year, the Kershaws travel to Africa to visit with the children and bring awareness to the issues of diseases and infections related to HIV and AIDS.\n\n\u201cWe feel like we are all called to different places,\u201d Ellen Kershaw said. \u201cSome of us are called to Africa, some of us are called to our own backyards.\u201d\n\nIn 2012, the couple co-authored \u201cArise: Live Out Your Faith and Dreams on Whatever Field You Find Yourself. The book chronicles their life together and their trips to Africa.\n\nKershaw\u2019s Challenge is also involved with Sharefest in Los Angeles and Mercy Street in his hometown of Dallas. Both charities seek to improve the lives of at-risk youth through after-school programs and sports.\n\nKershaw laughed when he was asked if he pushed baseball on the kids at Sharefest or Mercy Street.\n\n\u201cHonestly, baseball is not that important,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t really care what sports kids are playing. I just want them to have the opportunity to do it, if they want to do it, I hope that we can provide that for them. There\u2019s definitely opportunities for sports programs at Share Fest and Mercy Street and things like that, but we\u2019re definitely not pushing baseball on them. If they want to play soccer or baseball or basketball or whatever, go for it.\u201d\n\nSince 2011, Kershaw has taken the mound knowing he\u2019s pitching for \u201cStriking Out to Serve,\u201d his program that donates $500 to Kershaw\u2019s Challenge for each batter he strikes out. He led the National League in 2013 with 232 strikeouts, meaning he raised $160,00.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Branch Rickey Award,Clayton Kershaw,Los Angeles Dodgers", "language": "en, sv", "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "og": {"site_name": "On the Rox", "description": "Saturday night, Clayton Kershaw was in Denver to receive the Branch Rickey Award -- for service above self -- presented by the Rotary Club of Denver.", "title": "Dodgers Clayton Kershaw well deserving of Branch Rickey Award", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/rockies/2013/11/16/dodgers-clayton-kershaw-well-deserving-of-branch-rickey-award/15974/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/rockies/files/2013/11/clayton-kershaw.jpg", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "Saturday night, Clayton Kershaw was in Denver to receive the Branch Rickey Award -- for service above self -- presented by the Rotary Club of Denver.", "title": "Dodgers Clayton Kershaw well deserving of Branch Rickey Award", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/rockies/2013/11/16/dodgers-clayton-kershaw-well-deserving-of-branch-rickey-award/15974/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/rockies/files/2013/11/clayton-kershaw.jpg", "creator": "@psaundersdp", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "Saturday night, Clayton Kershaw was in Denver to receive the Branch Rickey Award -- for service above self -- presented by the Rotary Club of Denver."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd42cf\"", "article_summary": "Saturday night, Kershaw was in Denver to receive another prestigious award: The Branch Rickey Award \u2014 for service above self \u2014 presented by the Rotary Club of Denver.\nKershaw is one of the good guys because of this: Last year, he won Major League Baseball\u2019s Roberto Clemente Award.\nNot because he just won his second National League Cy Young Award in the last three years.\nKershaw laughed when he was asked if he pushed baseball on the kids at Sharefest or Mercy Street.\nNot because he\u2019s always been a gentleman with me and the rest of the media when he\u2019s wearing Dodger blue."}
