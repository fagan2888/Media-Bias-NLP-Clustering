Fort Dorchester completed their 1st ever perfect season on Saturday by winning their 1st ever state championship beating Dorman 59-31 at Williams-Brice Stadium in Columbia to take the AAAA Division 1 crown.

The win ends the Patriots season at 15-0.

What was expected to be a shootout lived up to the hype early on as the teams were tied at 17 with under 4 minutes to go in the 1st half. From there, the Fort took over. A 2 yard touchdown run from Datron James put the Patriots up 24-17. That was followed by an interception and another James score to make it 31-17 at the half.

The 2nd half began the same way as Dakereon Joyner connected with Adonicas Sanders on a 43 yard score followed by Joyner connecting with Nick Dederick on another touchdown pass after Dorman fumbled the ensuing kickoff. That made it a 45-17 lead and the Patriots never looked back.

In all, Joyner would total 366 yards and 4 touchdowns. James helped lead the way for the Fort going for 137 yards and 3 touchdowns on the ground while Diondre Champaigne had 5 catches for 129 yards.

Fort Dorchester forced 4 Dorman turnovers overall.
