But a new study has discovered that more doctors are now recommending them to patients to help curb their tobacco habit.\n\nPublished in the journal PLOS ONE, the study reviewed 128 doctors in North Carolina, asking them about their e-cigarette opinion. The researchers found that two-thirds of doctors thought e-cigarettes could be useful in helping people stop smoking, and 35 percent said they had recommended them to their patients.\n\n\u201cEven in the absence of evidence regarding the health impact of e-cigarettes and other vaping devices, a third of physicians we surveyed are recommending e-cigarettes to their patients to help quit smoking,\u201d Leah Ranney, an author of the study and associate director of the Tobacco Prevention and Evaluation Program at the University of North Carolina, said in a press release.\n\nDespite this apparent \u201cgo ahead\u201d signal, Ranney warns that e-cigarettes still aren\u2019t FDA-approved for smoking cessation, and that \u201cphysicians should refrain from recommending e-cigarettes until more is known about their safety.\u201d In fact, 13 percent of the doctors questioned had no idea that e-cigarettes weren\u2019t FDA-approved yet.\n\nAnother recent study claims that the benefits of e-cigarettes outweigh the risks, and that this should be taken account when the FDA and other regulatory agencies decide how to regulate e-cigarettes. Currently, not enough research has been done to determine long-term effects of vaping.\n\n\u201cIf there are any risks, these will be many times lower than the risks of smoking tobacco,\u201d Dr. Hayden McRobbie of the Wolfson Institute of Preventive Medicine at Queen Mary University of London, who is an author of the study, said. \u201cWe need to think carefully about how these products are regulated. What we found is that there is no evidence that these products should be regulated as strictly as tobacco, or even more strictly than tobacco.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "e-cigarettes, vaping", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "A new study finds that two-thirds of doctors believe that e-cigarettes can help smokers quit, and 35 percent of them have recommended vaping devices to patients.", "title": "Two-Thirds Of Doctors Believe E-Cigarettes Can Help Smokers Quit", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/doctors-are-now-recommending-e-cigarettes-help-smokers-quit-tobacco-study-says-296244", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/02/e-cigarettes.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A new study finds that two-thirds of doctors believe that e-cigarettes can help smokers quit, and 35 percent of them have recommended vaping devices to patients.", "title": "Two-Thirds Of Doctors Believe E-Cigarettes Can Help Smokers Quit", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/doctors-are-now-recommending-e-cigarettes-help-smokers-quit-tobacco-study-says-296244", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/02/e-cigarettes.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/02/e-cigarettes.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Healthy Living", "published_time": "2014-08-02T17:31:45-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-08-02T17:24:15-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "A new study finds that two-thirds of doctors believe that e-cigarettes can help smokers quit, and 35 percent of them have recommended vaping devices to patients."}, "article_summary": "But a new study has discovered that more doctors are now recommending them to patients to help curb their tobacco habit.\nWhat we found is that there is no evidence that these products should be regulated as strictly as tobacco, or even more strictly than tobacco.\u201d\nPublished in the journal PLOS ONE, the study reviewed 128 doctors in North Carolina, asking them about their e-cigarette opinion.\nThe researchers found that two-thirds of doctors thought e-cigarettes could be useful in helping people stop smoking, and 35 percent said they had recommended them to their patients.\nAnother recent study claims that the benefits of e-cigarettes outweigh the risks, and that this should be taken account when the FDA and other regulatory agencies decide how to regulate e-cigarettes."}
