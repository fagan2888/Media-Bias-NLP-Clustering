If (the Rockies) want me to throw it, I\u2019ll throw it. But if it\u2019s in a tough situation where I\u2019m not way ahead of the batter, then I\u2019m going to shake (off) to the slider.\u201d\n\nThe right-handed starter gave up two runs on four hits, walked two and struck out one. Gray began working on the curveball during the winter and brought the pitch into camp, hoping to make it a new weapon. To this point, he can\u2019t command it well enough to trust it. For example, in the first inning Saturday, Gray threw an 2-0 curve to Milwaukee\u2019s Domingo Santana, who drilled the pitch for a run-scoring double.\n\nAsked if the curveball would be a usable pitch in time for regular season, Gray said: \u201cIt\u2019s possible. I\u2019m just going to work on it to see how good it can get.\u201d\n\nManager Walt Weiss said it\u2019s not urgent for Gray to have an effective curve, at least not right down.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s mostly a matter of when you throw it,\u201d Weiss said. \u201cI think he can still throw it at times. But it\u2019s his fourth pitch, so it\u2019s about deciding when to throw it.\u201d\n\nGray currently throws a fastball, a slider and a changeup.\n\nAnderson scratched\n\nLefty Tyler Anderson was originally scheduled to start Saturday\u2019s game in front of Gray, but he was scratched about 15 minutes before first pitch because of a sore right oblique. Anderson has an outside shot at making the starting rotation, but if the oblique becomes problematic, that would hurt his chances.\n\n\u201cHe felt it throwing, while playing catch before he got on the mound,\u201d Weiss said. \u201cIt\u2019s an injury you want to be careful with. We don\u2019t know the extent of it, but we weren\u2019t taking any chances.\u201d\n\nAnderson, the team\u2019s top draft pick out of Oregon in 2011, has a 6.75 ERA in two Cactus League games. He missed last season because of a stress fracture in his left elbow suffered late in the 2014 season at Double-A Tulsa.\n\nSaturday would have been Anderson\u2019s first spring training start. After a rough first outing, he was coming off a scoreless, two-inning, three-strikeout, one-hit performance against the Cubs on Monday.\n\nCatching question\n\nDustin Garneau and Tom Murphy are competing for the No. 2 catching job behind starter Nick Hundley. Murphy, who has only 11 major-league games under his belt, might be able to provide the Rockies with more power at the plate, but as the No. 2 catcher he would see more limited action than if he played daily at Triple-A.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s something we will take into consideration as to who needs more development,\u201d Weiss said. \u201cWho can handle that backup catcher role when they are usually playing about once a series?\u201d", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Rockies\u2019 Jon Gray puts new curveball on the bench for now", "title": "Rockies\u2019 Jon Gray puts new curveball on the bench for now", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/03/12/rockies-jon-gray-puts-new-curveball-on-the-bench-for-now/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "height": 630}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2016-03-12T18:30:21+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-03-12T18:30:21+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Asked if the curveball would be a usable pitch in time for regular season, Gray said: \u201cIt\u2019s possible.\nGray began working on the curveball during the winter and brought the pitch into camp, hoping to make it a new weapon.\nIf (the Rockies) want me to throw it, I\u2019ll throw it.\nPHOENIX \u2014 Jon Gray is a having a little trouble with the curve, so he\u2019s shelving his new pitch \u2014 at least for the rest of the Cactus League season.\nFor example, in the first inning Saturday, Gray threw an 2-0 curve to Milwaukee\u2019s Domingo Santana, who drilled the pitch for a run-scoring double."}
