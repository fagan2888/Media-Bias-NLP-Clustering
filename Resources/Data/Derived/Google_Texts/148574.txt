As the number of Democrats running for Congress in Minnesota’s 2nd District dropped to one, the number of Republicans interested in the seat grew to six Thursday.

Darlene Miller, the CEO of Permac Industries, a precision parts manufacturing company in Burnsville, stressed her business experience in announcing her campaign.

“A growing economy with more and better paying jobs will ease the daily pressures on people’s lives. Economic growth will also allow us to get the federal deficit under control if we hold the line on spending.” Miller said, “I know how to create good jobs, because I’ve done it right here in Burnsville.”

Miller blamed government for blocking job growth.

“ObamaCare, taxes, over-regulation, and deficit spending are crushing our country and killing the jobs that help the middle class. Working families and small businesses need Washington to get out of the way and I look forward to fighting for them in Congress,” she said.

Miller said she grew up as one of eight children on a family farm in New Prague in Scott County. In 1992 she started as a Sales Representative at Permac and bought the company in 1994. She lives in Prior Lake.

Miller joins David Gerson, John Howe, Pam Myhra, Jason Lewis and David Benson-Staebler in the race for the GOP nomination for the seat, which John Kline has held since 2003. Kline is not running for re-election this year.

Angie Craig became the sole DFL candidate for the seat this week when her two opponents ended their campaigns.
