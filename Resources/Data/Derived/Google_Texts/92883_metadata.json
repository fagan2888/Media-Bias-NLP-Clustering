This year, 24 seats are located in the box with the First Lady, Dr. Jill Biden and Valerie Jarrett. Twenty three individuals have been invited, and one seat will be left vacant as a statement about victims of gun violence.\n\nOne of the First Lady\u2019s guests is Cary Dixon. Cary is an opioid reform advocate whose adult son has a prescription abuse disorder. Dixon\u2019s experience represents the Administration\u2019s position on opioids, which is, \u201cprescription drug abuse and heroin use have taken a heartbreaking toll on too many Americans and their families.\u201d\n\nOther guests who will sit with the First Lady include a Syrian refugee, a mayor from Shelby County, TN, a same-sex marriage advocate, a police chief, an Affordable Care Act \u201cnavigator,\u201d the CEO of Microsoft, among others. Each represent something that is important to the President\u2019s legacy or his going-forward political agenda. Each represent different slices of America \u2013 some very small, and a few large. None represent the 100 million Americans in pain.\n\nSome members of Congress have invited guests that have a position on opioids.\n\nRep. Richard Neal (D-MA) and Sen. Edward Markey (D-MA) have invited Mass. Attorney General, Maura Healey, who will attend the speech and push for federal help combating opioid abuse.\n\nHealey is known for making Amphastar Pharmaceuticals pay the state $325,000 to cover the cost of Narcan, which had risen from about $22 per dose to $65 per dose.\n\nSen. Tim Kaine (D-VA) has invited Don Flattery, who lost his son to an opioid overdose in 2014. Flattery has become an advocate in the fight against opioid addiction and is a member of the Governor\u2019s Task Force on Prescription Drug and Heroin Abuse. Sen. Kaine introduced legislation to help prevent opioid overdose deaths by encouraging physicians to co-prescribe naloxone alongside opioid prescriptions and by making naloxone more widely available in federal health settings.\n\nSen. Mark Kirk (R-ILL) has invited Mark Filler, who lost is son to a heroin overdose in 2014, and is an advocate for increasing access to naloxone. Filler started the Jordan Michael Filler Foundation, which promotes the message that substance abuse is a medical disease that should be treated accordingly.\n\nAmerica does have a serious opioid addiction and overdose problem. And, it needs to be addressed.\n\nThe growing fear is that the government\u2019s proposed solutions to the addiction and overdose problem may do great harm to people in pain by limiting access to critically important care and pain medicines. As such, there is a growing fear that only one side of a two-sided issue will be heard.\n\nThe State of the Union address starts at 9:00 pm ET.\n\nSubscribe to our blog via email", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "National Pain Report", "description": "The topic of opioids, particularly as they relate to addiction and overdose (as opposed to treatment of chronic pain) has inserted itself in the fast-moving madness of politics.
