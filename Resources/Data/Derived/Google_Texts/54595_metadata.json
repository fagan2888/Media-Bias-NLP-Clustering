Patients typically report pain that is different from the initial complaint, but not always. It is most commonly seen in patients receiving high doses \u2013 100 mg and above of the morphine equivalent. Patients with OIH may also show other signs of toxicity, for example, myoclonus, delirium, and seizures (indicating neuroexcitability). In addition, increasing opioid doses in patients exhibiting OIH will make the pain worse, and pain can be improved by removing or eliminated the opioid.OIH is \u201ca state of nociceptive sensitization caused by a paradoxical response upon exposure to specific or certain amounts of opioids,\u201d said Gudin. He also explained that according to the top theories in the literature \u201cthe underlying mechanisms are not fully understood, but an imbalance of pronociceptive and antinociceptive processes seem to be involved.\u201dGudin described some of the individual case reports and small studies that provide evidence for OIH, but also said the evidence is conflicting. A number of studies have reported increased sensitivity to cold pressor, electrical, and pressure pain in opioid addicts maintained on methadone. Increased sensitivity to cold pressor pain has been the most consistently observed indication of OIH, with some methadone-maintained patients unable to tolerate very cold water for any amount of time (normal tolerance would be a few minutes). Postoperative opioid exposure came under scrutiny about 10 years ago when two well-designed studies showed increased pain in postoperative patients even with increased doses of opioids, but these studies have not been repeatable. OIH has been better established in chronic pain patients, but treatment options are so limited that opioids must be used. \u201cOIH is not a reason to avoid opioids,\u201d Gudin emphasized, \u201cbut, there is enough evidence to keep it in mind.\u201dThe treatment options for OIH include \u201creducing, rotating, or completely tapering the opioid \u2013 the simplest way to test for OIH,\u201d Gudin explained. When rotating opioids, doses calculated from reference conversion charts should be reduced by 50% or even more. Clear data indicates that switching from an opioid to methadone reduced OIH, although OIH is also seen in methadone-maintained patients. Drugs that diminish neuroexcitability, such as antiepileptics, antidepressants, and NMDA antagonists (for example ketamine) may also reduce OIH. Gudin proposes using these options before an insult, such as surgery, that will require opioids, thus calming the nervous system.In summary, Gudin explained that OIH should not limit the use of opioids, but practitioners should be on the lookout for unusual pain patterns, especially pain that cannot be explained or pain that is diffuse and non-specific.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Although the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood, opioid-induced hyperalgesia occurs in some patients on higher doses of opioids.
