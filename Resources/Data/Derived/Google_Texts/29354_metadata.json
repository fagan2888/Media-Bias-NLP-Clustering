Flooding has caused it to lean. (Credit: The Gazette)\n\nThe Waldo Canyon trail is going wild.\n\nIt has been nearly three years since the popular, scenic hike was barred to the public after the 2012 Waldo Canyon fire, which ignited just west of the trail in the Pike National Forest. Since the fire, Mother Nature has been having her way with the once-beloved hiking area that climbs above westbound U.S. 24.\n\nGrass covers the trail's first steps leading out of the parking lot. Noxious weeds blur the lines between trail and wilderness. Sometimes, dust in the air smells like soot.\n\nWhile the trail's first few turns would be familiar, if overgrown, to its fans, floodwaters have all but obliterated its upper loop. Where the trail used to fork, it's unrecognizable.\n\nA few familiar things remain - such as a log bench and a battered sign pointing to \"Waldo Canyon Trail, 31/2 mile loop.\" Copses of trees stand alive, almost miraculously, amid row after row of blackened and weathered sticks.\n\nThe trail transforms every year, as snowmelt and summer rains carve new paths down Waldo Canyon. Past the trail's fork, the streambed has washed away traces of the trail, burying it in feet of sediment, boulders and dead trees. Without droves of hikers, runners and mountain bikers hitting the trail every day, Waldo Canyon has become the kind of place where bears are surprised to see a human.\n\nClick here to read the complete article by our partners at The Gazette.", "article_metadata": {"description": "It has been nearly three years since the popular, scenic hike was barred to the public after the 2012 Waldo Canyon fire, which ignited just west of the trail in the Pike National Forest.", "language": "english", "author": "The Gazette", "og": {"url": "http://www.kktv.com/news/headlines/Forces-Of-Nature-Overtake-Waldo-Canyon-Trail-In-Wake-Of-2012-Fire-302300821.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/631*315/waldo+sign.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "It has been nearly three years since the popular, scenic hike was barred to the public after the 2012 Waldo Canyon fire, which ignited just west of the trail in the Pike National Forest.", "title": "Forces Of Nature Overtake Waldo Canyon Trail In Wake Of 2012 Fire"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.kktv.com", "description": "It has been nearly three years since the popular, scenic hike was barred to the public after the 2012 Waldo Canyon fire, which ignited just west of the trail in the Pike National Forest.", "title": "Forces Of Nature Overtake Waldo Canyon Trail In Wake Of 2012 Fire", "url": "http://www.kktv.com/news/headlines/Forces-Of-Nature-Overtake-Waldo-Canyon-Trail-In-Wake-Of-2012-Fire-302300821.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/waldo+sign.jpg", "creator": "@kktv11news", "site": "@kktv11news", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "keywords": "Forces Of Nature Overtake Waldo Canyon Trail In Wake Of 2012 Fire", "google-site-verification": "gUw-UdhXT7u-BunNWfQWA_t3azu7BEGubOcNT6HddJQ", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Forces Of Nature Overtake Waldo, Canyon Trail In Wake Of"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9fe0\"", "article_summary": "(Credit: The Gazette)The Waldo Canyon trail is going wild.\nA few familiar things remain - such as a log bench and a battered sign pointing to \"Waldo Canyon Trail, 31/2 mile loop.\"\nThough much has changed along the Waldo Canyon Trail since the 2012 fire, this sign at the start of the 3 1/2 mile loop still stands.\nThe trail transforms every year, as snowmelt and summer rains carve new paths down Waldo Canyon.\nWithout droves of hikers, runners and mountain bikers hitting the trail every day, Waldo Canyon has become the kind of place where bears are surprised to see a human."}
