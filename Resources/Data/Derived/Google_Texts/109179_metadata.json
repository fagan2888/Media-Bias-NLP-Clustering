(WIVB) \u2013 More doctors are retiring or moving out of Western New York than are setting up new practices here, according to a recent survey by a state hospital group.\n\nThe reason why comes down to economics. The cost of a medical degree requires student loans that many doctors can\u2019t afford to pay back, and the pay is considerably lower for physicians in smaller regions like Western New York or smaller, compared to big cities, such as New York or Los Angeles.\n\n\u201cThe challenge is getting people to come here in the first place, and take a look around,\u201d says Dr. Anne Curtis, a recruiter and a Distinguished Professor at the University at Buffalo Medical School.\n\nDr. Curtis knows the challenges of getting students to come here to train, and doctors to come here to work. With doctors graduating from medical school with student debt in the hundreds of thousands of dollars, she says many have go into medical specialties or sub-specialties, rather than primary care.\n\n\u201cAnd then when you are looking particularly at primary care physicians, they don\u2019t get paid as well as sub-specialists. So a lot of students look at that and say, can I really afford to do that?\u201d\n\nDr. John Notaro, a primary care physician with the Buffalo Medical Group believes \u201cteam care\u201d will replace the one-on-one interaction between doctor and patient and is fast becoming the wave of the future. Rather than having a primary care physician, a group of medical practitioners, including nurses and pharmacists, will work with patients.\n\n\u201cThe quick response that they can get from a physician assistant may be faster than the doctor. So patients will come to reward the inputs that they get from every member of the team, including the primary care physician, who still has to be a part of it,\u201d he explained.\n\nDoctors also agree that as costs rise and demands from the Affordable Care Act increase, telemedicine or tele-health, which can connect doctor and patient over great distances, is becoming the care delivery vehicle of the future.\n\nDr. Ali El-Solh, the interim Chief of Staff at the VA Western New York Healthcare System, says tele-health is growing, especially in rural areas, \u201cfor lung diseases, ear, nose, and throat, for eye diseases, dermatology. So it is really expanding at a fast pace.\u201d\n\nBut the medical community and civic leaders agree the Buffalo Niagara Medical Campus, with its innovations in medical science and research, is fast becoming a magnet for world-class medical practitioners and future doctors.\n\n\u201cIt creates a modern tertiary care medical center to provide the best care for the people of Western New York that is attractive to students who are looking to decide where they are going to practice in the future,\u201d Dr. Curtis contends.", "article_metadata": {"description": "More doctors are retiring or moving out of Western New York than are setting up new practices here, according to a recent survey by a state \u2026", "generator": "WordPress.com", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.linmedia.newstouch.wivb", "og": {"site_name": "wivb.com", "description": "More doctors are retiring or moving out of Western New York than are setting up new practices here, according to a recent survey by a state hospital group.", "title": "Survey finds doctors are moving out of WNY", "url": "http://wivb.com/2014/04/04/wny-doctor-drain-following-the-money/", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "https://lintvwivb.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/new_law_offers_testing_for_baby_boomers_2016210000_4980056_ver1-0_640_480.jpg", "height": 360}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "More doctors are retiring or moving out of Western New York than are setting up new practices here, according to a recent survey by a state hospital group.", "title": "Survey finds doctors are moving out of WNY", "image": {"src": "https://lintvwivb.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/new_law_offers_testing_for_baby_boomers_2016210000_4980056_ver1-0_640_480.jpg?w=640"}, "creator": "@news4buffalo", "site": "news4buffalo", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "Buffalo News, Buffalo Weather | WIVB-TV News 4 Buffalo, NY | WIVB.com", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=488276218", "fb": {"pages": 83900655504}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "application-name": "wivb.com", "google-site-verification": "rCC8KvhYhxYynxDuL7C_fyWPtSiu1m13vV8Xe8bufDg", "msvalidate.01": "25404283363C09DE121A55A903F03873", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/news4buffalo", "published_time": "2014-04-04T23:31:48+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-04-04T23:31:48+00:00"}, "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://wivb.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/f7d9afd22abc1421f3f3acc9bc34faf7?s=16"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd26e7\"", "article_summary": "\u201cAnd then when you are looking particularly at primary care physicians, they don\u2019t get paid as well as sub-specialists.\nRather than having a primary care physician, a group of medical practitioners, including nurses and pharmacists, will work with patients.\nDr. Curtis knows the challenges of getting students to come here to train, and doctors to come here to work.\nBUFFALO, N.Y.
