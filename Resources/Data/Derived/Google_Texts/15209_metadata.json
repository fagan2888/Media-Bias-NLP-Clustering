I hope the jury thinks so, too.\u201d Brauchler quickly deleted the message, and later said he thought he was replying to a text message.\n\nThe gaffe led to criticism from the defense, a rebuke by the judge and, ultimately, the dismissal of three of the trial\u2019s jurors who became aware of the incident after one juror\u2019s husband read about it in the news and told her. A Denver woman with ties to statehouse Democrats later filed a misconduct complaint against Brauchler, a Republican, over the gaffe.\n\nOn Friday, a lawyer with the state Attorney Regulation Counsel wrote in a letter to Brauchler and the complainant that, \u201cthere is not clear and convincing evidence to conclude there is a violation of the Rules of Professional Conduct.\u201d The lawyer cited Brauchler\u2019s apology for the gaffe, among other factors.\n\nJohn Ingold: 303-954-1068", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "George Brauchler won\u2019t face professional sanctions for courtroom tweet", "title": "George Brauchler won\u2019t face professional sanctions for courtroom tweet", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/09/01/george-brauchler-wont-face-professional-sanctions-for-courtroom-tweet/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150828__20150829_A1_CD30PELXBRAUCHLERp1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150828__20150829_A1_CD30PELXBRAUCHLERp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-09-01T18:00:09+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-21T20:30:02+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Aurora Theater Shooting, Aurora Theater Shooting trial"}, "article_summary": "Arapahoe County District Attorney George Brauchler will not face professional sanctions over a social media message he posted from the courtroom during the Aurora movie theater murder trial.\nA Denver woman with ties to statehouse Democrats later filed a misconduct complaint against Brauchler, a Republican, over the gaffe.\nI hope the jury thinks so, too.\u201d Brauchler quickly deleted the message, and later said he thought he was replying to a text message.\nOn June 4, as the defense cross-examined a prosecution witness whose video-recorded interview of James Holmes was a key piece of evidence in the trial, Brauchler posted a message to Twitter saying, \u201cI agree on the video.\nJohn Ingold: 303-954-1068"}
