Keaton frantically popping amphetamines in \u201cFamily Ties\u201d; Kimberly and Arnold getting kidnapped by a dastardly stranger on \u201cDiff\u2019rent Strokes\u201d; Cherie hiding in a dangerous old refrigerator in \u201cPunky Brewster.\u201d One of the most infamous Very Special Episodes comes from the early-\u201990s show \u201cSaved by the Bell,\u201d when classic type-A overachiever Jessie Spano becomes addicted to \u2026 wait for it \u2026 caffeine pills. (A more innocent time, then.)\n\nVery Special Episodes were often canned, hokey, preachy, and over the top (one highlight from \u201cFamily Matters\u201d showed nerdy Steve Erkel getting deliriously drunk at a party, flopping off a dance floor, mysteriously rocketing out of a window, and landing on a window ledge 10 feet away, left dangling above death\u2019s open door.) In the new millennium, where irony, worldliness, and sarcasm reign, one would think we\u2019re in more sophisticated\u2014or at least more disillusioned\u2014times, deserving of more subtle, artistic, propaganda. Think Sundance. Think Banksy, the mysterious street artist. Think Bon Iver, the woodsy, misty poetry slam/musical act, or whoever the new Bon Iver is.\n\nNope. Witness \u201cBetween Two Ferns,\u201d a faux Internet talk show featured on the humor website Funny or Die. Hosted by \u201cHangover\u201d star Zach Galifianakis, each episode features awkward, insulting, and often amusing exchanges with celebrities like Bruce Willis (\u201cHow many children do you have? Which is your favorite\u2014Ashton?\u201d), Justin Bieber (\u201cIt\u2019s really exciting to talk to you, especially right in the middle of your public meltdown\u201d) and Natalie Portman (mostly awkward silence). The show is usually pretty funny. This week, to the delight of some and the chagrin of others, the featured guest was our own commander-in-chief, Barack Obama.\n\nIt was not subtle. After 3\u00bd minutes of perfunctory but decent jokes, the president launched into an earnest, two-minute speech explaining why every young, healthy person (not coincidentally, the target demographic of Funny or Die) needed to sign up for Obamacare (\u201cat HealthCare.gov!\u201d) by March 31. Young people need to do this, of course, because the massive, clunky, tangled mess of a health insurance scheme Obama pasted together with Krazy Glue will otherwise collapse into a heaping pile of smoking rubble, crushed banjos, unicorn tears, and shattered dreams. (He didn\u2019t actually say that last part, but the veiled desperation was pretty clear.)\n\nAs propaganda efforts go, in terms of gaining eyeballs, this one wasn\u2019t half bad: At press time, the video had earned 12 million views. Whether a significant portion of those eyeballs then went to HealthCare.gov is still under debate. According to Tara McGuinness, a White House senior communications adviser, traffic on the enrollment website surged \u201calmost 40 percent\u201d since the video aired. Other numbers aren\u2019t so flattering: As of 6 p.m. on the first day it aired, the Funny or Die video had 6 million views\u2014but only 32,000 viewers clicked through to HealthCare.gov.\n\nWhether that traffic will convert into actual sign-ups from actual healthy young people remains to be seen. Many of them might, for instance, discover that their Obamacare options cost just a wee bit more than what the president promised\u2014the same cost as \u201cyour cellphone bill!\u201d\u2014in his now-viral interview. (Interestingly, in a recent town-hall presentation with Spanish-language media, the president suggested that people might have to \u201cprioritize,\u201d cutting out their cable or cellphones to pay for Obamacare. Hmm.)\n\nMost of the criticism of Obama\u2019s appearance on Funny or Die has centered on the somewhat anachronistic question of whether it was in some way \u201cbeneath\u201d or \u201cdemeaning to\u201d the office of the presidency. That ship has clearly sailed: Modern media is modern media, and presidents are likely smart to embrace it. Far more interesting, however, is another question: What does it mean for our culture when what is marketed to be \u201chip\u201d and \u201csubversive\u201d and \u201cedgy\u201d\u2014and widely accepted as such\u2014comes off more like an obvious, preachy \u201980s sitcom?\n\nWatching Obama desperately wedge a two-minute policy request into a purported comedy appearance was cringe-worthy, but not in the funny, in-the-know way that \u201cBetween Two Ferns\u201d intends. In fact, it was strikingly reminiscent of another recent piece of pop culture propaganda, when Lena Dunham, left-wing activist, star of \u201cGirls,\u201d and all-around media darling, appeared on \u201cSaturday Night Live.\u201d In a painful, plodding skit involving a hapless \u201cmen\u2019s rights activist\u201d accidentally attending a women\u2019s jewelry party, Dunham inserts a labored speech defending the honor of Planned Parenthood, \u201ca place where women can go for low-cost medical advice and care!\u201d That was pretty much the point of the skit. It sounded like she was talking to very small, unfriendly children. It was, in short, a very weird, completely-devoid-of-funny Very Special Episode.\n\nAmericans, unfortunately, are apparently getting used to being treated like kindergarteners. Each year, the government spends hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars on \u201cpublic service announcements\u201d\u2014I\u2019ve personally seen highway signs telling me how to safely cook food and brush my teeth in the past few months\u2014and outright propaganda, including $684 million on Obamacare promotions alone. I suppose we should all feel grateful that Obama took a freebie when it came to \u201cBetween Two Ferns,\u201d as it may be the first and only Obamacare-related activity that won\u2019t cost everyone an arm and a leg.\n\nBut we should also, perhaps, be a little bit insulted. As the host of \u201cBetween Two Ferns,\u201d Zach Galifianakis plays a self-absorbed, awkward, combative mess who can\u2019t get anything right. As the on-air recipient of Barack Obama\u2019s condescending health care monologue, he also serves as a metaphorical stand-in for the speech\u2019s real target audience: the American people, and particularly young people. That\u2019s not a flattering comparison. Obama\u2019s appearance on \u201cBetween Two Ferns\u201d may have been a lot of things, but one is worth remembering: It offers a pretty clear image of the dopes he thinks we really are.", "article_metadata": {"description": "For those of us who grew up in the '80s\u2014or, alternatively, if you just happened to watch a fair amount of TV during that glorious era\u2014the term", "title": "Propaganda for Dummies? | RealClearPolitics", "og": {"url": "http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2014/03/13/propaganda_for_dummies__121918.html", "image": "http://images.rcp.realclearpolitics.com/121407_2_.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "For those of us who grew up in the '80s\u2014or, alternatively, if you just happened to watch a fair amount of TV during that glorious era\u2014the term", "title": "Propaganda for Dummies? | RealClearPolitics"}, "twitter": {"site": "@rcp_articles", "card": "summary"}, "tweetmeme-title": "Propaganda for Dummies? | RealClearPolitics", "fb": {"app_id": 1415921935346245}, "keywords": "Health care,Barack\n  Obama,zach galifianakis,", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe109d\"", "article_summary": "In the new millennium, where irony, worldliness, and sarcasm reign, one would think we\u2019re in more sophisticated\u2014or at least more disillusioned\u2014times, deserving of more subtle, artistic, propaganda.\nAs propaganda efforts go, in terms of gaining eyeballs, this one wasn\u2019t half bad: At press time, the video had earned 12 million views.\nIt was, in short, a very weird, completely-devoid-of-funny Very Special Episode.\nThe show is usually pretty funny.\nThat ship has clearly sailed: Modern media is modern media, and presidents are likely smart to embrace it."}
