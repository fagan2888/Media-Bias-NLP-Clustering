REUTERS/Yuri Gripas\n\n4484118\n\nA debate over a bill to fund the Department of Homeland Security devolved into name-calling Thursday when House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer was caught on an open microphone calling House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy a \u201ccoward.\u201d\n\nHoyer, a Maryland Democrat, and McCarthy, a Republican from California, were hammering out a schedule to vote on a bill to fund the Department of Homeland Security for three weeks.\n\nDHS will run out of money by midnight Friday if a bill isn\u2019t passed. Democrats want to vote on a clean bill to fund the agency for the entire year. Many Republicans hope to block the bill because they do not want to fund President Obama\u2019s executive amnesty action.\n\n\u201cMr. Leader, we have been now, you\u2019re correct, six weeks leaving the Department of Homeland Security twisting in the wind. We\u2019ve done that, as the gentleman knows\u2026\u201d Hoyer said to heckling from House members.\n\nAt that point, McCarthy jumped in to reclaim the time he yielded to Hoyer.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been very clear about the schedule for tomorrow. We will end our work by tomorrow evening. This house has taken action to make sure the DHS was fully funded. We did our part and I yield back.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou coward,\u201d Hoyer is heard saying.\n\nHoyer told CNN after the exchange that he regretted making the comment.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not a coward. I just apologized to him,\u201d Hoyer told a CNN reporter as he left the floor of the House.\n\n\u201cI said something I shouldn\u2019t have said,\u201d he said, adding that McCarthy accepted the apology.\n\nWATCH:\n\nFollow Chuck on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Chuck Ross", "description": "Debate rages over DHS funding", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "A debate over a bill to fund the Department of Homeland Security devolved into name-calling Thursday when House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer was caught on an open microphone calling House Majority Leader", "title": "Hot Mic: Democratic Whip Calls Republican Majority Leader \u2018Coward\u2019 During DHS Debate [VIDEO]", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2015/02/26/hot-mic-democratic-whip-calls-republican-majority-leader-coward-during-dhs-debate-video/", "image": {"width": 794, "identifier": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/2013-12-03T164516Z_1_CBRE9B21AJN00_RTROPTP_4_USA-HEALTHCARE-e1398785735471.jpg", "height": 342}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Debate rages over DHS funding", "creator": "@@ChuckRossDC", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2015/02/26/hot-mic-democratic-whip-calls-republican-majority-leader-coward-during-dhs-debate-video/", "image": {"src": "http://dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/2013-12-03T164516Z_1_CBRE9B21AJN00_RTROPTP_4_USA-HEALTHCARE-e1398785735471.jpg"}, "title": "Hot Mic: Democratic Whip Calls Republican Majority Leader \u2018Coward\u2019 During DHS Debate [VIDEO] Via @dailycaller", "site": {"identifier": "@dailycaller", "id": 39308549}, "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-02-26 21:28:38", "sailthru.title": "Hot Mic: Democratic Whip Calls Republican Majority Leader 'Coward' During DHS Debate [VIDEO]", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "keywords": "dhs,kevin mccarthy,steny hoyer", "fb": {"app_id": 143489452702, "pages": 182919686769}, "sailthru.tags": "dhs,chuck-ross", "sailthru.description": "A debate over a bill to fund the Department of Homeland Security devolved into name-calling Thursday when House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer was caught on an open microphone calling House Majority Leader", "sailthru.image.full": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/2013-12-03T164516Z_1_CBRE9B21AJN00_RTROPTP_4_USA-HEALTHCARE-e1398785735471.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf05b\"", "article_summary": "Leader, we have been now, you\u2019re correct, six weeks leaving the Department of Homeland Security twisting in the wind.\nI just apologized to him,\u201d Hoyer told a CNN reporter as he left the floor of the House.\nU.S. Representative Steny Hoyer (D-MD) talks to the media on Obamacare following a Caucus meeting on Capitol Hill in Washington, November 14, 2013.\nWe\u2019ve done that, as the gentleman knows\u2026\u201d Hoyer said to heckling from House members.\nDemocrats want to vote on a clean bill to fund the agency for the entire year."}
