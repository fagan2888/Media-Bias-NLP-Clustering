Only in the claim that it has never been more divided. Everyone seems to agree on that. \u201cThe two parties have never been further apart,\u201d wrote the liberal Ezra Klein last fall. \u201cRepublicans and Democrats are currently further apart ideologically than our political parties have traditionally been,\u201d wrote the conservative Ross Douthat, a mere four days later. Only the fact of our polarization brings us together; we are fractured in everything except our mutual sense of brokenness.\n\nMany liberals attribute this situation to an increasingly radicalized Republican Party. Some Republicans do, too. Immediately after the 2012 election, Bobby Jindal, the Republican governor of Louisiana, lashed out at the \u201coffensive, bizarre comments\u201d of some GOP candidates, whom he accused of espousing a \u201cdumbed-down conservatism.\u201d Republicans, he insisted, must \u201cstop being the stupid party.\u201d The RNC\u2019s own \u201cautopsy\u201d of the 2012 results, issued in March of last year, made many of the same points. (In kinder, gentler terms, of course.)\n\nBut some Republicans bridle at this kind of talk. Polarization suits them just fine. As they see it, there is only one alternative to being their kind of Republican, and that alternative \u2014 namely, being a Democrat \u2014 is truly a fate worse than death. Calls for them to be more \u201cmoderate,\u201d more \u201creasonable,\u201d strike them as calls to adopt policies like those of liberals \u2014 advice they reject with great alacrity. David Limbaugh, brother of Rush, provided a characteristic formulation of this response not long after President Obama\u2019s victory in 2008. Anticipating that Republicans would be pressured to work with Obama \u201con a wide variety of issues,\u201d David Limbaugh cautioned that if \u201cRepublicans reduce themselves to offering merely liberal lite the next four years\u201d they would do nothing but compound the damage of Democratic legislation.\n\nBut there is more to our predicament than disputes over policy. These differences, after all, aren\u2019t so much the scourge of politics as the reason we have politics in the first place \u2014 if everyone agreed about everything, we wouldn\u2019t need elections. Our problem isn\u2019t necessarily that Republicans support lower marginal rates for high-income taxpayers or smaller cost-of-living increases for Social Security recipients. We had a politics like that once \u2014 as recently as the George H.W. Bush years \u2014 and, though often fraught and volatile, it ushered in actual achievements. Things got done.\n\nOur problem is that many of today\u2019s most influential Republicans think of Social Security as a \u201cPonzi scheme\u201d and identify the progressive income tax (originally introduced by Woodrow Wilson) as the focus of evil in the modern world. President Eisenhower famously counseled Republicans to accept the welfare state introduced by Progressives and New Dealers. Conservative energies, he insisted, would be better spent managing its pretensions \u2014 and warding off Democratic excesses \u2014 than in contesting its basic framework. And for the next 40 years or so, the Goldwater insurgency aside, this is more or less what they did.\n\nBut in the wave election of 1994, Bill Clinton\u2019s attempt at health care reform \u2014 \u201cHillarycare,\u201d as Republicans christened it \u2014 provided an issue focus for the Right\u2019s cultural rage at the Clintons and swept in the Gingrich Congress. As the government shutdown of 1995 soon demonstrated, these were not Eisenhower \u2014 or even Reagan \u2014 Republicans. Something had changed. The ideological purification of the Republican Party, a process underway since the 1950s, was now producing politicians who were not content to be \u201ctax collectors for the welfare state,\u201d to borrow an epithet Gingrich hurled at Bob Dole. They had come not to restrain the modern state but to bury it. The scene of conflict between Democrats and Republicans shifted from the details of policy to the institutional framework within which policy is made. This conflict, in turn, is rooted in a profound clash of worldviews, a clash that reflects wildly divergent attitudes toward modernity.\n\nTo see this, let\u2019s explore two different \u201ccreation stories\u201d about political modernity. The first one, I think, is accepted by most Democrats and many Republicans:\n\nThe United States exists because of two moments in European history. Originally the country was shaped by its status as an outpost of European imperialism. As in most such cases, the colonizers struggled with indigenous peoples who were variously bribed, massacred, ignored, and exploited. (A later influx of African slaves added another layer to this sorry story.) The British colonies gained formal independence in 1783, but their basic institutions \u2014 and intellectual elites \u2014 remained deeply influenced by a second historical episode, the English Enlightenment. The first fact, the fact of distance and newness, meant that American society largely evaded the legacies of Europe\u2019s feudal past; class distinctions in particular pressed much less heavily. The second fact meant that American politics reflected the Enlightenment\u2019s emphasis on individual liberty (for white males, anyway) as essential for personal happiness and social progress. Allied with this was a belief that liberty is mainly threatened by powerful institutions with absolutist tendencies, be they governmental or ecclesiastical. This was the template for American development until the last third of the 19th century. At that time new forces began to strain against its limits. Some of these concerned the marginalized groups mentioned earlier, women and African-Americans especially, who rightly agitated for more complete social identities \u2014 identities that would include a broader panoply of rights and powers. Others derived from the enormous changes wrought by the Industrial Revolution. New technologies in communications, production and transportation swept away whole orders of life. American society had been mainly rural and agrarian; now it became increasingly urban and industrial. The locus of production moved from the subsistence farm to the factory. Suddenly it was possible to link locales previously separated by continental (or global) distances, so distribution escaped its largely regional confines and expanded accordingly. All of these changes spoke to an even more fundamental transformation: the reorganization of economic life around the modern corporation, an entity of unprecedented scope and scale. These features of the corporation drove improvements in efficiency and productivity that would have been unthinkable mere decades before. This, in turn, brought about something truly singular in human history \u2014 a genuinely middle-class society, in which most households engaged in commercial activity and experienced life as something more than scarcity or mere subsistence. But this progress came at a cost. The people who abandoned farms in the country for factories in the cities often encountered conditions that were harsh and inhumane. Hours were long and the work could be dangerous. Cities struggled to absorb the influx of urban laborers and to provide the infrastructure and social services they required. When it became clear that industrial capitalism was as vulnerable to booms and busts as earlier forms of market society, cities faced another challenge as well: that of managing unprecedentedly large numbers of people whom recession or depression could transform into an angry, immiserated proletariat. As the 19th century gave way to the 20th, political actors evolved ways to accommodate these forces within the American system. The NAACP, founded in 1909, pressed the claims of African-Americans to the full citizenship promised by the Civil War amendments to the Constitution; in 1919, first-wave feminists finally secured women the right to vote. The Progressive movement, championed by both Republicans (Theodore Roosevelt) and Democrats (Woodrow Wilson), accepted corporate capitalism as the new economic order \u2014 \u201cThe old individualism is dead,\u201d Roosevelt once remarked \u2014 but insisted that government act to limit its excesses and to regulate its behavior. Their early reforms sought to strengthen competition (antitrust laws) and to stabilize the financial system (the creation of the Federal Reserve), and also secured the abolition of child labor and a standardized work week. The spirit of these measures later enlivened the New Deal legislation of the 1930s and the Great Society programs of the 1960s. And thus the modern American state emerged \u2014 sometimes haphazardly, sometimes half-heartedly, almost always maddeningly slowly \u2014 from the need to respond politically to the realities of the modern American economy and society.\n\nThe second story, on the other hand, is endorsed by the most activist elements of the Republican Party and the most influential members of the conservative commentariat:\n\nAmerica\u2019s existence is providential. We are an exceptional people because our Constitution alone embodies the principles God established for His children, chief among them the paramount importance of individual liberty as the crucible of real faith and true virtue. To be sure, America has stumbled along the way. Mistakes were made, slavery most obviously, but even a divine omelet requires a few broken eggs. The country largely hewed to its original inspiration until the later 1800s, when Lincoln claimed unprecedented powers for himself during the War Between the States. His was the original imperial presidency, and it awakened the federal government\u2019s ravenous appetite for influence and control. One might chalk this up to the exigencies of the moment \u2014 Lincoln did, after all, have a war to fight \u2014 but in his wake events took a decidedly darker turn. Seduced by the siren strains of European secularism, America\u2019s intellectual elites abandoned liberty in favor of equality. From their base in the country\u2019s educational system \u2014 including its most prestigious universities \u2014 they gradually poisoned the minds of its political class. The result was socialism in economics and a radical egalitarianism in politics. The Progressives and New Dealers replaced the free market with an economy planned and controlled from Washington; feminists, civil rights agitators, and homosexuals turned the power of the federal government against traditional, time-honored values and mores. Now, in 2014, we have a government fatally unmoored from its original principles and an electorate largely duped and/or bribed into not noticing or caring. An embattled remnant of the population \u2014 despised, ridiculed, harried \u2014 preserves the pure American faith in its mainly rural redoubts in the South and West, but whether it can reclaim the country is increasingly in doubt. One thing, however, is certain: If it fails, America will be lost forever.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The essential conflict in today's politics is not between Democrats and Republicans -- but factions of the right", "title": "GOP\u2019s epic internal struggle: The modernists vs. libertarian fabulists", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The essential conflict in today's politics is not between Democrats and Republicans -- but factions of the right", "title": "GOP\u2019s epic internal struggle: The modernists vs. libertarian fabulists", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/02/15/gops_epic_internal_struggle_the_modernists_vs_libertarian_fabulists/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/02/jindal_paul.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The essential conflict in today's politics is not between Democrats and Republicans -- but factions of the right", "title": "GOP\u2019s epic internal struggle: The modernists vs. libertarian fabulists", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/02/jindal_paul.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Kim Messick", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Editor's Picks, GOP, libertarians, Modernity, Republican Party, Republicans, Tea Party", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8781\"", "article_summary": "Topics: Editor's Picks, GOP, libertarians, Modernity, Republican Party, Republicans, Tea Party, Business News, Politics NewsIf we look for unity in our politics today, where can we find it?\nAmerican society had been mainly rural and agrarian; now it became increasingly urban and industrial.\nMany liberals attribute this situation to an increasingly radicalized Republican Party.\nAnd thus the modern American state emerged \u2014 sometimes haphazardly, sometimes half-heartedly, almost always maddeningly slowly \u2014 from the need to respond politically to the realities of the modern American economy and society.\nThey had come not to restrain the modern state but to bury it."}
