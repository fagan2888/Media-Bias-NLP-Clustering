Another Silicon Valley company is heading this way. SnapLogic, based in San Mateo, has leased a 3,563-square-foot space on Pearl Street in Boulder and opened a sales office this week.

The company, which calls itself an “elastic integration platform as a service,” plans to hire 10 people by the end of June. It currently has 8 job openings.

SnapLogic helps companies tackle the too-much-data problem by offering a web-based system to manage all those data sources. It has a drag-and-drop feel to make the process human friendly.

Garrett Cole, director of sales, started the job on Thursday and will manage the office, which is located at 929 Pearl St., Suite 200.
