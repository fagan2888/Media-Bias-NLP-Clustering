And both power grabs extend beyond intelligence collection to common crime fighting.\n\nThe U.S. data grab started back in December, when the Department of Justice applied for a warrant covering an email account Microsoft held in Ireland as part of a drug-trafficking investigation. Microsoft complied with regards to the information it stored in the U.S. (which consisted of subscriber information and address books), but challenged the order for the content of the emails. After Magistrate Judge James Francis sided with the government \u2014 arguing, in part, that Mutual Legal Assistance Treaties, under which one country asks another for help on a legal investigation, were too burdensome \u2014 Microsoft appealed, arguing the government had conscripted it to conduct an extraterritorial search and seizure on its behalf.\n\nAs part of that, Microsoft Vice President Rajesh Jha described how, since Snowden\u2019s disclosures, \u201cMicrosoft partners and enterprise customers around the world and across all sectors have raised concerns about the United States Government\u2019s access to customer data stored by Microsoft.\u201d Jha explained these concerns went beyond NSA\u2019s practices. \u201cThe notion of United States government access to such data \u2014 particularly without notice to the customer \u2014 is extremely troubling to our partners and enterprise customers located outside of the United States.\u201d Some of those customers even raised Magistrate Francis\u2019 decision specifically.\n\nThe other American cloud computing companies piled on with amicus curiae briefs supporting Microsoft\u2019s position: Verizon, AT&T, Apple, Cisco, Infor, as well as the NGO Electronic Frontier Foundation.\n\nThe government\u2019s response, however, argued U.S. legal process is all that is required. DOJ\u2019s brief scoffed at Microsoft for raising the real business concerns that such big-footing would have on the U.S. industry. \u201cThe fact remains that there exists probable cause to believe that evidence of a violation of U.S. criminal law, affecting U.S. residents and implicating U.S. interests, is present in records under Microsoft\u2019s control,\u201d the government laid out. It then suggested U.S. protection for Microsoft\u2019s intellectual property is the tradeoff Microsoft makes for complying with legal process. \u201cMicrosoft is a U.S.-based company, enjoying all the rights and privileges of doing business in this country, including in particular the protection of U.S. intellectual property laws.\u201d It ends with the kind of scolding usually reserved for children. \u201cMicrosoft should not be heard to complain that doing so might harm its bottom line. \u201d\n\nHowever the legal fight ends up, this is largely legal theater in which a bunch of providers \u2014 including some of the ones (like AT&T and Microsoft) that have been most amenable to government intelligence collection requests \u2014 make a show of resisting the iron fist of U.S. demands.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Government's new power grab extends beyond intelligence gathering to stopping basic crime.
