Here are three scenarios.\n\n1. The Do-Nothing Option\n\nNeither the Obama Administration, Congress or the states does anything to reinstate subsidies after the Supreme Court ruling. Without the federal subsidies, people buying insurance in the 34 states without their own exchange see their monthly costs nearly triple, on average, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. Unable to afford insurance, many people would drop their coverage, leaving a pool of sicker customers. Insurance companies are forced to raise their prices, forcing more people to drop and creating a so-called \u201cdeath spiral\u201d of higher rates and more uninsured people in the individual insurance market. It would disrupt the healthcare market outside of Obamacare, too.\n\n\u201cIf no one did anything, the individual markets would blow up,\u201d said Gary Claxton, vice president of the Kaiser Family Foundation who studies the Affordable Care Act.\n\n2. Congress Steps In\n\nThe Republican-led Congress fixes the law, allowing residents of states without their own insurance marketplaces to continue receiving subsidies. This could be a short-term fix (until after the next presidential election) or a permanent fix. It could be part of a compromise which also changes another part of the law. However it\u2019s done, the fix would allow the 6.4 million people to continue buying health insurance with the help of federal subsidies and the law would continue working as designed.\n\nMany congressional Republicans are opposed, however.\n\n3. Red Obamacare, Blue Obamacare\n\nCongress doesn\u2019t act, but state governments do. In some states without their own marketplaces, governors and lawmakers move to create their own marketplace, designate the federal HealthCare.gov website as their state marketplace or partner with another state. In other states, politicians stand back and do nothing. This leads to a division in the U.S., with Obamacare working poorly in many red states that don\u2019t have marketplaces and continuing to work in many blue states, similar to how the Medicaid expansion has worked.\n\nPresident Obama said on Tuesday said his signature healthcare law is \u201cpart of the fabric of how we care for one another,\u201d adding, \u201cThis is health care in America.\u201d But the end of June, that would only be true in some states.", "article_metadata": {"description": "If it rules against the Obama administration, the Supreme Court could kill health insurance subsidies for people in 34 states.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "TIME.com", "description": "Here are three scenarios.", "title": "What Happens if the Supreme Court Rules Against Obamacare?", "url": "http://time.com/3915406/supreme-court-obamacare-2/", "image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/obama3.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/obama3.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012"}, "description": "Here are three scenarios.", "site": "TIME", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "What Happens if the Supreme Court Rules Against Obamacare?"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-tooltip": "Current & Breaking News | National & World Updates", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://time.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/2cee445ea71a179ffd35ea91cf154905?s=16", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "fb": {"app_id": 53177223193}, "p": {"domain_verify": "f48a8936c3fffc943fce516f2e3ff1d2"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/time2014/img/time-touch_icon_152.png", "application-name": "TIME", "keywords": "supreme court, obamacare, affordable care act, king v. burwell, barack obama, health care", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/time"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Supreme Court, Obamacare, Affordable Care Act, King v.
