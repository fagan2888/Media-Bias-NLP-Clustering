Newark saw a real-estate boom in 2012 that Mayor Cory Booker likes to tout publicly.

He did it during his State of the City address in March, and he did it just last week in a campaign e-mail he sent out, seeking support for his U.S. Senate run. Booker, a Democrat, and Republican Steve Lonegan are running in an Oct. 16 special election to fill the late Frank Lautenberg's Senate seat.
