But the real drop is actually steeper since the 10% doesn\u2019t account for cost increases that have occurred in the past five years.\n\nDuring roughly the same period, the number of IRS personnel has fallen by at least 8%. And the amount of money the agency has for staff training has dropped by more than 85%.\n\nMeanwhile, the number of taxpayers has grown by about 7 million people, IRS Commissioner John Koskinen noted at the same conference where Olson spoke.\n\nEnd result: Come January 20, when the IRS will start accepting returns, there will be less taxpayer service and, Koskinen warned, possibly delayed refunds.\n\nOlson, a watchdog for taxpayers, estimates that 47% of the calls coming into the IRS probably won\u2019t be answered during the filing season. The other 53% of people lucky enough to get through will have to wait an average of 34 minutes to talk to a human being.\n\nTax preparers calling on behalf of their clients may use a \u201cpriority service\u201d line. But it will take them about 52 minutes to talk to someone, Olson said. \u201cSo my advice is to bring your knitting while you sit on the phone trying to get through.\u201d\n\nKoskinen said the IRS will do all it can to keep everything running smoothly. But the agency will be hamstrung.\n\n\u201cAll we can try to do is maximize the resources available in that January to May time frame to make sure that \u2026 we do as well as we can. And \u2018as well as we can\u2019 is still going to be miserable,\u201d he said.\n\nBut if that misery includes seriously delayed refunds \u2014 still a very big if \u2014 that\u2019s when average Americans may take note of just how under the gun the IRS is. And they won\u2019t like it.\n\n\u201cIf the refund doesn\u2019t come, that\u2019s going to make them angry. This is dysfunction right in your face,\u201d said Christopher Bergin, president and publisher of Tax Analysts.\n\nMore work and complexity despite less money: The upcoming tax season will be the first when the IRS will have to administer the premium tax credits and individual mandates under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nFirsts are never perfect, of course. But given how controversial health reform has been, any hiccups in the administration of Obamacare will be broadcast loudly by politicians, the press and frustrated tax professionals.\n\nOne concern Olson has: The IRS won\u2019t receive accurate information from the insurance exchanges. \u201cThe IRS will probably get blamed for a lot of things that it is not responsible for, and that will not do well on the Hill as we try to make our case for additional funding,\u201d she said.\n\nIt will also be the first tax filing season when the IRS will be administering the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act. FATCA is intended to recapture money the United States loses because of unpaid taxes on Americans\u2019 overseas accounts.\n\nOlson worries the process won\u2019t be seamless for U.S. ex-pats trying to reconcile their tax bills given the new reporting requirements. \u201cWho are they going to call? There is no toll-free number to call overseas and you\u2019re certainly not going to sit there for 34 minutes overseas letting the clock tick on a toll call.\u201d\n\nThe ramifications of budget cuts amidst a heavier workload goes beyond 2015, Koskinen said. \u201cAny marked deterioration in taxpayer service and enforcement creates a long-term risk for the U.S. tax system, which is based on voluntary compliance.\u201d\n\nIn other words, Americans, who have one of the best compliance rates in the world, may not be so willing to oblige if they can\u2019t get the help they need, or if they know they won\u2019t get caught if they cheat.\n\n\u201cIf the compliance rate goes down by 1 percent, it costs the government $30 billion a year. That\u2019s almost three times the entire budget of the IRS,\u201d Koskinen noted.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The upcoming tax season is likely to be the worst in years -- for the IRS and potentially for taxpayers.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=572089813", "og": {"site_name": "WTVR.com", "description": "The upcoming tax season is likely to be the worst in years \u2014 for the IRS and potentially for taxpayers.", "title": "\u2018Miserable\u2019 tax season could be worst in years", "url": "http://wtvr.com/2015/01/05/miserable-tax-season-could-be-worst-in-years/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "https://localtvwtvr.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/s013196673.jpg?w=1200", "height": 803}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"app": {"id": {"ipad": 572089813, "iphone": 572089813}}, "creator": "@cbs6", "image": {"src": "https://localtvwtvr.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/s013196673.jpg?w=640"}, "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@cbs6"}, "keywords": "national, news, business economy and money, military and government", "p": {"domain_verify": "fc2caefd8163039c48c3b35b178e0993"}, "fb": {"pages": 6860957425}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "application-name": "WTVR.com", "google-site-verification": "xp-vKfdwBt7bllcG4eSrgb2mL-O45aD7dIeyF4EmMF8", "msvalidate.01": "9CC50DB4C5614EA88B5CFA75E33AAB02", "article": {"publisher": "http://facebook.com/cbs6wtvr", "published_time": "2015-01-05T16:02:01+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-01-05T16:02:01+00:00", "author": "http://facebook.com/cbs6wtvr"}, "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://wtvr.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/1e5f8555355860d96f4528b85609455b?s=16"}, "article_summary": "NEW YORK \u2014 The upcoming tax season is likely to be the worst in years \u2014 for the IRS and potentially for taxpayers.\nIt will also be the first tax filing season when the IRS will be administering the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act.\nMore work and complexity despite less money: The upcoming tax season will be the first when the IRS will have to administer the premium tax credits and individual mandates under the Affordable Care Act.\nThe reason: The IRS budget keeps getting smaller, and the tax code keeps getting more complicated.\nThe budget: Congress has shrunk the IRS budget over the past five years, while at the same time requiring the agency to administer even more complex laws."}
