CMS also said it allows for greater collaboration between the agency and ACOs to improve communications with patients about the characteristics and potential benefits of ACOs in relation to their care.\n\nCollege of Healthcare Information Management Executives President and CEO Russell Branzell, in an interview with FierceHealthIT, calls the model the next logical step in the payment and patient management system that IT should be ready to support.\n\n\n\n\"Talking to hospital CEOs and CIOs, this is something that's been on their radar for a while,\" Branzell says. \"Generally, everyone knew this was coming. Hopefully someday we'll get to a wellness model, but this is that next step out of fee-for-service to some level of risk capitation.\"\n\nAs to concerns expressed by existing ACOs that it becomes more difficult to earn savings every year, CMS says the new model addresses the problem by incorporating relative efficiency into the discount and through the development of a long-term benchmarking methodology for performance years four and five.\n\nLike current ACO models, the next generation ACOs will use historical expenditures to develop their baselines and benchmarks for the first three years. The baseline is risk-adjusted and trended before CMS applies the discount, which incorporates regional and national efficiency.\n\n\"Under this approach, ACOs achieve savings through year-to-year improvement over historic expenditures [improvement], but the magnitude by which they must improve will vary based on relative efficiency [attainment],\" CMS explains in the FAQ. \"This recognizes past achievements of efficient ACOs.\"\n\nUnlike the Pioneer model, the next generation will also have two application cycles. The first round of applications is due June 1; the second cohort of applications are due a year later on June 1, 2016.\n\nClif Gaus, president and CEO of the National Association of ACOs, told FierceHealthcare this morning that he is still reviewing the details surrounding the new model and couldn't yet offer feedback on what it means for the future of ACOs.\n\nBlair Childs, senior vice president of public affairs, Premier, a healthcare performance improvement alliance of approximately 3,400 U.S. hospitals and 110,000 other providers, says in a statement that the organization is eager to work with its members to assess the model. CMS' announcement \"gives healthcare providers another Medicare payment option with substantially greater flexibility to provide innovative, high-quality care to a defined group of beneficiaries,\" he says.\n\nIn addition, Childs says it is important that CMS continue to provide a range of options for providers to test different payment models and organizational structures in an accountable care environment. \"With this announcement, providers have even more choices, which will enable the market to both mature and evolve,\" he says.\n\nFor more:\n\n- read the CMS FAQ document (.pdf)\n\n- here's the Premier statement\n\nRelated Articles\n\nHIT stakeholders: Technology critical to 'Next Generation' ACO models\n\nCMS announces 'Next Generation' accountable care organization model\n\n3 more organizations drop out of Pioneer ACO program\n\nSpecial report: The future of accountable care organizations", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services' newest accountable care organization model aims to address problems experienced by the\u00a0Pioneer ACOs that caused many to drop out\u00a0when they failed to achieve the performance benchmarks and financial savings.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services' newest accountable care organization model aims to address problems experienced by the\u00a0Pioneer ACOs that caused many to drop out\u00a0when they failed to achieve the performance benchmarks and financial savings.", "title": "'Next Generation' ACOs: How they differ from Pioneer, MSSP models", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/next-generation-acos-how-they-differ-pioneer-mssp-models/2015-03-11", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs),Care Delivery,Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS),MSSP,Next Generation ACOs,Operations & Business Management,Pioneer ACOs", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Care Delivery,Operations & Business Management"}, "article_summary": "Like current ACO models, the next generation ACOs will use historical expenditures to develop their baselines and benchmarks for the first three years.\nUnlike the Pioneer model, the next generation will also have two application cycles.\nThe Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services' newest accountable care organization model aims to address problems experienced by the Pioneer ACOs that caused many to drop out when they failed to achieve the performance benchmarks and financial savings.\nFor more:- read the CMS FAQ document (.pdf)- here's the Premier statementRelated ArticlesHIT stakeholders: Technology critical to 'Next Generation' ACO modelsCMS announces 'Next Generation' accountable care organization model3 more organizations drop out of Pioneer ACO programSpecial report: The future of accountable care organizations\nIn addition, Childs says it is important that CMS continue to provide a range of options for providers to test different payment models and organizational structures in an accountable care environment."}
