Brentwood Grabs Z Gallerie

The deal underscores the importance of multiple distribution channels, especially e-commerce websites, in retail today

Brentwood Associates has purchased a majority stake in Z Gallerie, a retailer that sells home goods, including furniture, artwork, lighting, tabletop items, textiles and decorative accessories.

The Los Angeles private equity firm tapped into its fifth fund, Brentwood Associates Private Equity V LP  a $260 million fund raised in 2013  to complete the deal.

Terms of the transaction remain undisclosed.

Z Galleries founders  siblings Carole Malfatti, Joe Zeiden and Mike Zeiden  will retain a significant stake in the Gardena, California-based target. Z Gallerie, a 35-year-old business, originally opened as a poster shop before growing into a home decorating and furnishings retailer.

Currently, the company operates 55 retail locations across 20 states, and has a rapidly growing e-commerce business through its website.

We see a significant opportunity to accelerate growth of the current retail store base, while also dramatically increasing the companys direct marketing efforts, both online and offline, says Brentwood partner Steve Moore.

BMO Capital Markets advised Z Gallerie throughout the sale process, while Jeffrey Cohen and Andrew Garelick, partners of law firm Skadden Arps Slate Meagher & Flom LLP, handled legal matters.

Brentwood was represented by Greenberg Traurig LLP on the transaction. Kirkland & Ellis LLP andKeyBanc Capital Markets Inc. provided debt financing.
