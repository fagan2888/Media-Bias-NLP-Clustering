The Phil Harden Foundation and Meridian Community College put on the run.\n\n\u201cAll of the proceeds that are raised will be donated to the Collinsville Community Club to help with tornado relief,\u201d Deanna Smith says.\n\nSmith says the idea came from students. She says many of them live in the Collinsville area and wanted to do something to help with relief.\n\n\"We have several students that were affected even faculty and staff on campus. It was the student\u2019s idea to give back in some way,\u201d Smith says.\n\nSome residents are still trying to pick up the pieces of their homes. Lauderdale County District 3 Supervisor Josh Todd ran in the race and says progress is being made.\n\n\"The crews are doing the best they can to get it all up. We still have a little ways to go, but again, there is no timeline on getting debris out. Whenever you get it out there we\u2019ll come get it,\u201d Todd says.\n\nAround 150 runners took to the pavement. All of which received a piece of Collinsville for participation. Pieces of the Collinsville first Baptist Church, destroyed by the tornado, was turned into a metal, so everyone got to take home a piece of what they are running for.\n\n\u201cThey went out there and got the old wood. They cut it up and put the MCC logo on it. I just think that\u2019s great and fitting,\u201d Todd.\n\nIf you were affected by the Collinsville tornado and might need some relief you can go to the Piggly Wiggly of Collinsville to fill out a form. That form will then be taken into consideration and funds will be distributed when deemed necessary.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"medium": "video", "description": "A rally for Collinsville, running to help those still affected by the February tornado.
