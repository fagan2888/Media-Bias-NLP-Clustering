( Chris Richard )\n\nThe call to a Glendora emergency dispatcher one night last October had the grim details that, officials say, have become all too familiar: a woman had found her brother unconscious on his bathroom floor. She feared he\u2019d overdosed on drugs.\n\nWhen Glendora Police Corporal Bill Lee and his partner, Jon Drake, responded to the call, they found a scrap of aluminum foil beside the man, holding a little bead of heroin. They noted the man\u2019s sluggish heartbeat, faltering respiration and pinpoint pupils associated with opiate poisoning.\n\nBut unlike similar experiences in the past, this time Lee and Drake had a tool authorities credit with saving the man\u2019s life: they administered a nasal spray containing the potent opioid blocker naloxone.\n\nIn less than 90 seconds, the man\u2019s breathing returned to normal. He was taken to the hospital, and when Drake checked on him shortly afterwards, he was conscious, Lee said.\n\nLike other communities across California, Lee\u2019s small town in the foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains east of Los Angeles has seen a surge in heroin abuse.\n\nWhen there\u2019s an overdose call, it\u2019s often a police officer \u2014 like Lee \u2014 who is the first to arrive on the scene.\n\nIn the past, he said, he would do whatever he could. \u201cThen you wait for fire to get there, and unfortunately, sometimes things don\u2019t work out,\u201d he said. Now he\u2019s hoping the naloxone spray \u201cwill provide us with a means of changing that pattern.\u201d\n\nSome advocates call it the \u201coverdose antidote.\u201d\n\nLast year, California lawmakers authorized police officers to carry naloxone, also commonly known by a brand name, Narcan. Now, a handful of law enforcement agencies are issuing the emergency medication to officers.\n\nGlendora\u2019s tiny police department \u2013 which also was a pioneer two decades ago in equipping officers with defibrillators to help heart attack victims \u2013 issues naloxone to its emergency medical technicians.\n\nThe San Diego County Sheriff\u2019s Department recently moved beyond a test program to equip all deputies. San Francisco also has a pilot project underway. The Orange County Sheriff\u2019s Department expects to expand its initial program to include all deputies in the first quarter of this year, said Lt. Jeff Hallock, a department spokesman.\n\nSan Diego sheriff\u2019s Capt. James Bovet, who oversaw his department\u2019s pilot program, said the naloxone spray clearly met a need. From 2000 to 2014, the county saw the death rate from opioid overdose increase by 50 percent, \u201cand the trend was just increasing upward,\u201d he said.\n\nDuring the pilot program to test whether naloxone could help, sheriff\u2019s deputies frequently arrived at the scene of an overdose before paramedics, Bovet said. He said the San Diego Sheriff\u2019s Department has successfully revived 28 people with naloxone since the pilot program began. Orange County Sheriff\u2019s and Glendora officers have each recorded one save as well.\n\n\n\n\n\nOpioids depress brain functions that regulate breathing, and during an overdose, respiration slows, then stops. Naloxone kicks the opioids off those crucial brain receptors so an overdose victim can breathe again. While naloxone is non-addictive and generally considered safe, it pushes addicts into immediate withdrawal, sometimes triggering side effects such as a rapid increase in in blood pressure or seizures.\n\nAt the North Carolina Harm Reduction Coalition \u2013- a leading advocate of broadening naloxone availability \u2013- advocacy and communications coordinator Tessie Castillo calls such adverse reactions \u201cextremely rare.\u201d\n\nStill, some law enforcement agencies have balked at the $52-per-dose cost of the remedy, Castillo said.\n\n\u201cSometimes there\u2019s a reluctance to institute yet one more program and have officers train on yet one more thing,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019ll argue that the ambulance crews already get there soon enough.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, California has broadened access to the antidote further with a new law permitting pharmacies to sell naloxone without a prescription.\n\n\u201cThe evidence shows very clearly that the most effective way to make sure that naloxone is at the scene of an overdose is to get it into the hands of people who use drugs and their friends and family members,\u201d said Laura Thomas, California deputy director of the Drug Policy Alliance.\n\nBertha Madras, who served as deputy director of the White House Office on National Drug Control Policy in the George W. Bush administration, said she\u2019s gained confidence in naloxone\u2019s usefulness since it first came to her attention.\n\nMadras said that while serving as a deputy drug czar, she questioned whether widespread access to the antidote might lead addicts to \u201ca sense of confidence that they could push the envelope with higher doses.\u201d\n\nShe said she now strongly supports public safety personnel having ready access to naloxone. But the uninformed may be misled by the antidote\u2019s seeming ability to provide a miracle cure, she said. The body stores some opiates in fat for long periods, and an overdose could recur after the naloxone wears off, Madras said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "In a handful of California police and sheriff's departments, officers are carrying naloxone -- and reviving overdose victims.", "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"Under New Law, Cops Carrying Overdose Drug Are Saving Lives\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/2016\\/02\\/01\\/under-new-law-cops-carrying-overdose-drug-are-saving-lives\\/\",\"pub_date\":\"2016-02-01 09:08:44\",\"mod_date\":\"2016-01-31 21:37:42\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":143801,\"author_id\":\"8344\",\"author_name\":\"State of Health\",\"author_display_name\":\"State of Health\",\"tags\":[\"Naloxone\",\"News\",\"Opioids\"],\"categories\":[\"Policy\",\"Tests &amp; Treatments\"],\"image\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/sites\\/27\\/2016\\/01\\/NaloxoneAndLawEnforcement_2-e1454114626911.jpg\"}", "og": {"site_name": "State of Health", "description": "In a handful of California police and sheriff's departments, officers are carrying naloxone -- and reviving overdose victims.", "title": "Under New Law, Cops Carrying Overdose Drug Are Saving Lives", "url": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/2016/02/01/under-new-law-cops-carrying-overdose-drug-are-saving-lives/", "image": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/wp-content/uploads/sites/27/2016/01/NaloxoneAndLawEnforcement_1-400x288.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@kqedhealth", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@"}, "fb": {"app_id": 160023622793}, "keywords": "naloxone,news,opioids", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "He said the San Diego Sheriff\u2019s Department has successfully revived 28 people with naloxone since the pilot program began.\nJames Bovet, who oversaw his department\u2019s pilot program, said the naloxone spray clearly met a need.\nOrange County Sheriff\u2019s and Glendora officers have each recorded one save as well.\nDuring the pilot program to test whether naloxone could help, sheriff\u2019s deputies frequently arrived at the scene of an overdose before paramedics, Bovet said.\nThe San Diego County Sheriff\u2019s Department recently moved beyond a test program to equip all deputies."}
