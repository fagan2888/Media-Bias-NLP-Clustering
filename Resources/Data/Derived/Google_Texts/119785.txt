CNN Chief Political Analyst Gloria Borger said Democratic presidential candidate and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s position change on the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) is “pretty damning” on Thursday’s “Erin Burnett OutFront.”

Host Erin Burnett asked, “According to CNN, Hillary Clinton spoke out no fewer than 45 times…in favor of this trade deal, that this week she says she’s against. That’s pretty damning, isn’t it?”

Borger responded, “Yeah, I think it is. And when you look at her words, and again, here we are, parsing Hillary Clinton’s words, she said, ‘As of today, I am not in favor of what I have learned about it.’ So, does that mean that at a certain point she could say, ‘Well, okay, that was then, and this is now.’ If she believes that during a general election she m might want to switch a little bit? You know, I think it is pretty damning.

CNN Senior Political Analyst David Gergen added, “flip-flopping happens a lot in politics, but given her narrative, given the prevailing story about — that she’s — you can’t trust her, this is going to play into that narrative. I think Gloria is right. it’s damning and it’s not the only issue on which she’s flip-flopped.” He further cited Hillary’s flip-flops on the Keystone XL Pipeline and the Cadillac Tax in Obamacare.

Later, Gergen stated that Hillary’s change of position on TPP is “particularly unsettling.”
