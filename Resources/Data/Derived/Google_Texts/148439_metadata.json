Chris Akins, political strategist and founder of Akins Strategy, doesn\u2019t think that will change despite Republicans controlling Congress.\n\n\u201cMy bold prediction: there will be no major developments this year. Gridlock will keep anything major from happening, including immigration reform,\u201d Akins told CBSDC. \u201cMajor changes will happen from challenges in the courts and citizen initiatives, including full legalization of gay marriage across the country and further marijuana legalization. Police and corrections reform will happen at the state level.\u201d\n\nAkins believes one big issue to look out for this year is the latest Supreme Court case involving subsidies related to the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cThe real wild card that will be a game-changer is the pending Supreme Court ruling on Obamacare subsidies which could effectively kill the program. It\u2019ll come out in a 4-5 split regardless of the outcome,\u201d Akins said.\n\nLarry Sabato, director for the Center of Politics at the University of Virginia, believes that Obama and Republicans will be able to work together on legislation this year.\n\n\u201cJust because the president and Congress will clash on big-ticket items such as Obamacare and immigration doesn\u2019t mean they can\u2019t pass bipartisan legislation on trade, cybersecurity, and plenty of other matters,\u201d Sabato told CBSDC.\n\nStates will see much less gridlock than the nation\u2019s capital, however.\n\n\u201cBig things are much more likely to happen in the states than in Washington. Twenty-three states have all-GOP government, and seven states have all-Democratic government. There\u2019s far less chance of gridlock in state capitals than in the nation\u2019s capital,\u201d Sabato told CBSDC.\n\nThe new year also brings us closer to 2016 and who will replace Obama in the White House. Several Republicans are rumored to be running \u2013 former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, Sens. Rand Paul, Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio, among others. Democrats, on the other hand, are waiting to see what former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton does as many believe she will make a run for the White House again.\n\nSabato believes three big names, though, will not be stepping into the 2016 presidential ring.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll be inundated with candidacy announcements in 2015, but three oft-mentioned politicians won\u2019t run for president: Mitt Romney, Paul Ryan, and Joe Biden,\u201d Sabato told CBSDC.\n\nSabato stated that dark horse candidates will emerge when the primaries begin next year.\n\n\u201cDark horses are more likely to emerge when the actual voting begins in February 2016. But polls are a roller coaster so inevitably, especially on the GOP side, somebody or somebodies will move to the fore to challenge the frontrunners.\u201d\n\nWith Obama coming into his lame-duck years, CBS News political director John Dickerson told \u201cCBS This Morning\u201d that he will have to learn how to be a lame-duck president.\n\n\u201cBarack Obama, his aides will tell you, the way he cements his legacy is if a Democrat gets elected. If Hillary Clinton runs, she is the odds-on favorite, which means he will have to get up at some point and put on the lame-duck suit because he has to get out of her way,\u201d Dickerson explained. \u201cAnd he will have to do that of his own volition because he thinks that his legacy is cemented by her election. That\u2019s a tricky thing for a president to have to do when you\u2019re instinct is to struggle against it, but if he\u2019s out there making news, at some point the news he makes detracts from her candidacy.\u201d\n\nClinton has previously said she will announce this year whether she will run for president in 2016.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The new year has brought in a new Congress as Republicans officially took control of both chambers for the first time since President Barack Obama has been in the White House.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"url": "http://washington.cbslocal.com/2015/01/08/political-analyst-romney-biden-will-not-run-for-president-in-2016/", "image": {"width": 1500, "secure_url": "https://cbswashington.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/154031844.jpg?w=1500", "identifier": "https://cbswashington.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/154031844.jpg?w=1500", "height": 999}, "type": "article", "description": "The new year has brought in a new Congress as Republicans officially took control of both chambers for the first time since President Barack Obama has been in the White House.", "title": "Political Analyst: Romney, Biden Will Not Run For President In 2016"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://cbswashington.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/154031844.jpg?w=1500", "description": "The new year has brought in a new Congress as Republicans officially took control of both chambers for the first time since President Barack Obama has been in the White House.", "site": "/cbsdc", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Political Analyst: Romney, Biden Will Not Run For President In 2016"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "News, Sports, Weather, Traffic and the Best of Washington DC", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "application-name": "CBS DC", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/cbsdc", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/cbsdc"}, "keywords": "joe biden president, mitt romney president, 2015 political predictions", "google-site-verification": "44caXBf4kjHeKKAT7ZZ89NaCX25utL_yRSa-qGpwIhY", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://washington.cbslocal.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/b87f6ea5e510fe3d34ffe9a8dbe8c1cf?s=16", "news_keywords": "congress, joe biden, mitt romney, politics"}, "article_summary": "\u201cWe\u2019ll be inundated with candidacy announcements in 2015, but three oft-mentioned politicians won\u2019t run for president: Mitt Romney, Paul Ryan, and Joe Biden,\u201d Sabato told CBSDC.\nGridlock will keep anything major from happening, including immigration reform,\u201d Akins told CBSDC.\nThere\u2019s far less chance of gridlock in state capitals than in the nation\u2019s capital,\u201d Sabato told CBSDC.\nChris Akins, political strategist and founder of Akins Strategy, doesn\u2019t think that will change despite Republicans controlling Congress.\nGridlock was a way of life the previous two years while Democrats controlled the Senate and Republicans had the house."}
