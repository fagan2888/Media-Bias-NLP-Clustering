(Juana Arias for the Washington Post)\n\nOn a freezing night in late December, Ann Mead shivered outside the gates of Medstar\u2019s Washington Hospital Center, drawing only emotional warmth from the cluster of fellow nurses singing protest songs and receiving updates on contract negotiations that had stalled the previous month. They were nearing the end of a grueling strike: A one-day action had lengthened to 10 days when the hospital said it couldn\u2019t find replacement nurses for a shorter period. Ambulances and fire trucks honked in solidarity as they drove by.\n\nMead, 32, left her career in international relations to become a nurse only a year ago \u2014 but she\u2019s already starting to feel burned out. That\u2019s why she decided to take the financial hit of an extended unpaid vacation rather than break the strike: One of National Nurses United\u2019s key bargaining objectives is to increase the number of nurses at the hospital, which would give her fewer patients at a time to deal with in the cardiac surgery unit where she works.\n\n\u201cI am incredibly exhausted after every shift that I work, so mentally and physically exhausted,\u201d said Mead, a slim blonde, hunching into her parka. \u201cI feel like some days I think of everything I did that day, and I think, \u2018I could\u2019ve done this for this person, if I\u2019d just had the time to get to it.\u2019 And I have to convince myself that I did my best to prioritize what the most important things are for each person, because I couldn\u2019t get to everybody.\u201d\n\nWhy won\u2019t the hospital hire more people? It\u2019s not because there aren\u2019t enough nurses around \u2014 the much-talked-about \u201cnursing shortage\u201d has dissipated. RNs have put off retirement through the bad economy, and nursing schools have doubled their output of new graduates. Washington Hospital Center received 6,316 applications last year, and hired 7.5 percent of them.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s plenty of evidence that there\u2019s a shortage of nursing care, and it\u2019s not solved by anything to do with the hospital supply,\u201d said Linda Aiken, director of the Center for Health Outcomes and Policy Research at the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s nursing school. \u201cAll the shortage of care at the bedside has to do with how much hospitals want to pay nurses, and whether they want to use their resources on something else.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s plenty of evidence that there\u2019s a shortage of nursing care, and it\u2019s not solved by anything to do with the hospital supply,\u201d\n\nThat shortage of care at the bedside tends to be the worst in nursing homes, as well as in under-resourced rural facilities where it\u2019s hard to attract anyone to work. But if Mead\u2019s experience is any indication, staffing levels could be better at large urban institutions like Washington Hospital Center, too. And a growing body of research has tied more nurse attention to better patient outcomes, from lower rates of infection to shorter hospital stays \u2014 which ultimately save money and can help hospitals avoid costly lawsuits.\n\nSo, what\u2019s the best way to get more nurses on duty? The debate has been simmering for decades and is likely to only get more intense as health-care reform extends coverage to more people, and creates new standards that hospitals have to meet.\n\nNational Nurses United, a powerful and combative union that has grown quickly through mergers and organizing new hospitals over the last decade, has a preferred solution: mandatory minimum nurse staffing ratios. In 2002, it pushed through a law that imposed ratios in California, NNU\u2019s power base.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to tell how much the law helped patients. There\u2019s pretty solid evidence linking understaffing to bad results, like hospital-acquired infections and increased mortality rates. The evidence on the benefits of mandated nurse ratios is more mixed, with several reporting no significant changes to patient outcomes \u2014 although since the severity of illnesses and injuries in the California system increased at the same time, stasis may actually indicate that increased staffing helped prevent a corresponding increase in bad outcomes.\n\nThat\u2019s why even experts who\u2019ve spent years building the case that nurses are crucial to health outcomes \u2014 such as Lori Melichar, a labor economist at the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation \u2014 aren\u2019t willing to say that legislated minimums are the way to go. \u201cIt\u2019s a complicated question already,\u201d Melichar said. \u201cAnd when you layer on \u2018Is this policy going to be effective,\u2019 as a researcher and an economist, I can\u2019t make that determination.\u201d\n\nIt seems clearer, however, that the California law is good for nurses. Over the first few years of implementation, patient loads decreased by an average of one whole person per nurse, which boosted nurse job satisfaction and lowered their rates of occupational injury.\n\nThat\u2019s why NNU has pressed on, proposing mandatory nurse staffing ratios nationally through Congress and in more than a dozen states and the District of Columbia. Faced with intense resistance from the hospital industry, none of the measures have passed. A few states have required hospitals to set up labor-management committees to negotiate over staffing levels, but NNU dismisses that as a fake solution. And at Washington Hospital Center, the idea that NNU will be able to get any language on staffing levels through contract negotiations seems more remote by the day.\n\n\u201cThey want no conversation with the union or anybody about the way staffing goes,\u201d said Stephen Frum, the union\u2019s shop steward at Washington Hospital Center. \u201cThey want complete control.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey want no conversation with the union or anybody about the way staffing goes,\u201d said Stephen Frum, the union\u2019s shop steward at Washington Hospital Center. \u201cThey want complete control.\u201d\n\n\u2014-\n\nTo understand why hospital executives hate the mandatory minimums idea, listen to Washington Hospital Center\u2019s nursing director, Sue Eckert, talk about running the facility on a snow day. On Jan. 6, for example, Eckert got to work at 6:30 a.m. to deal with the chaos she knew she\u2019d find when she arrived.\n\n\u201cInfluenza is hitting beyond belief; our emergency room is packed,\u201d she said on an afternoon break in the hospital\u2019s administration suite. \u201cThe patients who are ready to leave aren\u2019t leaving, because nobody can come pick them up. But everybody who had a surgical procedure got here on time.\u201d Meanwhile, nurses are late, snarled in traffic, or calling in sick themselves.\n\nEvery four hours, Eckert got an e-mail with a little box that described the census of nurses, doctors and technicians in each unit. To keep staffing levels adequate across the building, Eckert shifted people around to the areas of greatest need \u2014 leaving some temporarily with a less-than-ideal ratio. If the District had a law like California\u2019s, Eckert said, that would\u2019ve been illegal. \u201cAnd I felt very comfortable that everything was safe,\u201d Eckert said. \u201cI would probably do it no matter what, but would possibly be exposed to a violation.\u201d\n\nEckert said she thinks that most of the time the hospital would meet California\u2019s requirements \u2014 but she doesn\u2019t want to have to make sure that the numbers don\u2019t ever sink below its stipulated ratios. \u201cI have such concern that people think a number is magic, and that number\u2019s is going to fix the problem,\u201d she said.\n\nSo, again, if nurses are available, and more nurses improve patient outcomes, why not just hire more nurses to avoid situations where you might have fewer people than you need?\n\n\u201cYou could do that,\u201d Eckert said. \u201cAnd then the reality is, you have the cost.\u201d The cost, of course, is increasingly relevant as the Affordable Care Act is requiring hospitals to be more efficient with their dollars \u2014 which they have historically done by cutting staff, not adding them.\n\nAs for Ann Mead\u2019s distress: Eckert chalked that up to the fact that it\u2019s her first year on the job, and first-years are always stressed out until they gain more experience. To try to mitigate that feeling, Washington Hospital Center has a nursing residence program, which is supposed to help newbies through the hardest stage. Over the past few years, the hospital has actually improved staffing, hiring more nurses and reducing the number of temporary nurses it used to hire from staffing agencies to fill gaps. Turnover rates have declined, from a high of 20 percent three years ago to an industry-average 12.8 percent in 2014.\n\nBut Mead isn\u2019t the only one feeling overburdened. A survey of nurses from last spring revealed that nurses were more concerned about staffing levels than almost any other aspect of their working conditions \u2014 especially on the general inpatient floors, where higher nurse staffing levels have more subtle benefits than in the intensive care units. And in the anonymous comments section, more than gripes about managers, the issue of staffing came up again and again.\n\n\u201cEmployees frequently verbalize frustration and without much hope of change,\u201d wrote one nurse, in a unit where 66 percent of respondents felt staffing levels were inadequate. \u201cAll clinical staff are stretched too thin.\u201d\n\nAnother offered the kind of scenario that results from having not enough hands on deck: A nurse is in the middle of passing medications, when a patient at risk of falling calls to go to the bathroom. Since there aren\u2019t enough nurses or technicians around to help, the unstable patient gets up to go by himself, exactly the kind of precarious situation that everyone is trying to avoid.\n\n\u2014-\n\nSo, if mandatory minimums aren\u2019t going any further, what\u2019s the way forward? The American Nursing Association supports flexible approaches, such as requiring hospitals to come up with adequate staffing plans for each unit, which allows them more freedom to adjust to sicker patients. Another partial remedy is transparency: Currently, hospitals aren\u2019t required to disclose staffing ratios at all, which makes it difficult to track whether they\u2019re improving or to compare one hospital with another. If nurse-to-patient ratios became one of the public metrics that go into rankings and evaluations, perhaps hospitals would staff up to compete for patients.\n\nNNU thinks that\u2019s a fake solution, too. \u201cThe problem is that it assumes that the way people decide what hospital people will seek care in is based on some consumerist model, like buying a car,\u201d said Ken Zinn, NNU\u2019s national political director. \u201cSure, for some elective surgeries that\u2019s the case. But mostly, it\u2019s where does your doctor have privileges, or where does the ambulance take me.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can do it for a while longer,\u201d Mead finishes, as the crowd starts to disperse. \u201cBut it\u2019s one of the main reasons I don\u2019t think I can do it for that long.\u201d\n\nThat may be true. But at the moment, NNU doesn\u2019t appear to have a better option. And until things get better, Ann Mead isn\u2019t sure how long she can stick around.\n\n\u201cI expected to be on my feet on my time; I expected it to be stressful because you\u2019re caring for lives \u2014 obviously that\u2019s a stressful thing in itself,\u201d she said. \u201cI did not expect it to be this intense, so often. What I did not expect was to not be listened to by my own hospital management, who are nurses themselves, to not regard what we\u2019re saying we need.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can do it for a while longer,\u201d Mead finishes, as the crowd starts to disperse. \u201cBut it\u2019s one of the main reasons I don\u2019t think I can do it for that long.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "It's not clear that mandating higher staffing ratios works -- but it's not clear that anything else will, either.", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "It's not clear that mandating higher staffing ratios works -- but it's not clear that anything else will, either.", "title": "More nurses are better for patients.
