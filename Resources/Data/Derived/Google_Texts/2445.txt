America now harnesses three times as much electricity from the wind and 20 times as much from the sun as we did in 2008. We've also invested in energy efficiency in every way imaginable – in our buildings, our cars, our trucks, our homes, our appliances – saving consumers billions of dollars along the way. More than 15,000 Alaska homeowners have cut their energy bills by 30 percent on average, collectively saving more than $50 million a year. And last month, I announced the first set of nationwide standards to end limitless carbon emissions from our power plants – the most important step we've ever taken on climate change.
