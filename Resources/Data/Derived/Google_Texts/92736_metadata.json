In fact, he's headed for a run-off with Cook County Commissioner Jesus Garcia in April after failing to gather enough votes for a victory last night. More from AP:\n\nIn a race Tuesday against four challengers, Emanuel discovered it wasn't enough to spend millions of dollars on TV ads, earn the backing of the city's business leaders, and secure the hometown endorsement of President Barack Obama. In order to keep the job, he'll need to win another race in six weeks against Jesus \"Chuy\" Garcia, a Cook County commissioner who claims the backing of teachers, unions and neighborhood residents disillusioned with Emanuel.\n\n\n\nEmanuel pledged to rev up campaigning immediately, starting Wednesday morning by shaking hands with residents at Chicago Transit Authority stops.\n\n\n\n\"We will get back out there, talking to our friends and families and neighbors as they make a critical choice about who has the strength, who has the leadership, who has the ideas to move this great city forward,\" Emanuel told supporters Tuesday evening.\n\nAce of Spades HQ Decision Desk is calling this humiliating for Emanuel.\n\nMake no mistake: this is utter humiliation for Rahm Emanuel. Not only will not avoid runoff, he's running dismally low. And I voted for him. \u2014 Jeff B@AoSHQDD (@EsotericCD) February 25, 2015\n\nGuess who will be back out on the campaign trail soon to try and save his hometown buddy? President Obama.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "Coming up short. .05/25/2016 20:32:46PM EST.", "author": "Katie Pavlich", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Coming up short.", "title": "- Rahm Emanuel Might Lose His Position as Mayor of Chicago", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/katiepavlich/2015/02/25/rahm-emanuel-might-lose-his-position-as-mayor-of-chicago-n1962065", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015/56/c2132b0b-832c-4017-89c0-8a0c171d6327.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Coming up short.", "title": "- Rahm Emanuel Might Lose His Position as Mayor of Chicago", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/katiepavlich/2015/02/25/rahm-emanuel-might-lose-his-position-as-mayor-of-chicago-n1962065", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015/56/c2132b0b-832c-4017-89c0-8a0c171d6327.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Rahm Emanuel Might Lose His Position as Mayor of Chicago , Katie Pavlich, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf5f0\"", "article_summary": "Last night Chicago voters headed to the polls and didn't overwhelmingly offer their support for incumbent mayor and former White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel.\nMake no mistake: this is utter humiliation for Rahm Emanuel.\nPresident Obama.\nEmanuel pledged to rev up campaigning immediately, starting Wednesday morning by shaking hands with residents at Chicago Transit Authority stops.\nIn fact, he's headed for a run-off with Cook County Commissioner Jesus Garcia in April after failing to gather enough votes for a victory last night."}
