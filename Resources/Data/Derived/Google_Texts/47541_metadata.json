Psychologist Steven Pinker\u2014a Harvard professor and author of The Better Angels of Our Nature: Why Violence Declined\u2014has written a belated response to William Deresiewicz, who argued that meritocracy has failed the Ivy League.\n\nPreposterous, writes Pinker. The Ivy League isn't nearly meritocratic enough. After all, elite colleges don't actually admit the objectively smartest students; they select applicants who check off racial boxes, satisfy legacy and donor considerations, improve the performance of athletic clubs, etc:\n\nAt the admissions end, it\u2019s common knowledge that Harvard selects at most 10 percent (some say 5 percent) of its students on the basis of academic merit. At an orientation session for new faculty, we were told that Harvard \u201cwants to train the future leaders of the world, not the future academics of the world,\u201d and that \u201cWe want to read about our student in Newsweek 20 years hence\u201d (prompting the woman next to me to mutter, \u201cLike the Unabomer\u201d). The rest are selected \u201cholistically,\u201d based also on participation in athletics, the arts, charity, activism, travel, and, we inferred (Not in front of the children!), race, donations, and legacy status (since anything can be hidden behind the holistic fig leaf). ... Jerome Karabel has unearthed a damning paper trail showing that in the first half of the twentieth century, holistic admissions were explicitly engineered to cap the number of Jewish students. Ron Unz, in an expos\u00e9 even more scathing than Deresiewicz\u2019s, has assembled impressive circumstantial evidence that the same thing is happening today with Asians.\n\nHolistic admissions are a waste of Ivy League resources, argues Pinker. Harvard spent tons of money to build some of the greatest libraries on the planet. It hires the smartest teachers and maintains the nicest facilities. But then it turns around and stocks its dormitories with kids who just want to play sports and join squirrel clubs!\n\nThe quest for extra-curricular activities is particularly absurd when admissions are scrutinized, Pinker writes:\n\nWhat about the rationalization that charitable extracurricular activities teach kids important lessons of moral engagement? There are reasons to be skeptical. A skilled professional I know had to turn down an important freelance assignment because of a recurring commitment to chauffeur her son to a resum\u00e9-building \u201csocial action\u201d assignment required by his high school. This involved driving the boy for 45 minutes to a community center, cooling her heels while he sorted used clothing for charity, and driving him back\u2014forgoing income which, judiciously donated, could have fed, clothed, and inoculated an African village. The dubious \u201clessons\u201d of this forced labor as an overqualified ragpicker are that children are entitled to treat their mothers\u2019 time as worth nothing, that you can make the world a better place by destroying economic value, and that the moral worth of an action should be measured by the conspicuousness of the sacrifice rather than the gain to the beneficiary.\n\nPinker's solution? Admissions based solely on standardized testing. I don't know if that's a particularly libertarian solution, but it's interesting nonetheless.
