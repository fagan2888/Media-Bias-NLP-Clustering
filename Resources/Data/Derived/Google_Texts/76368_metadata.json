And on July 1, a new religious group in Indiana intends to do just that \u2014 but with a lot more emphasis on the \u201chigh\u201d part.\n\nA little more than a month from now, the newly-formed First Church of Cannabis is scheduled to hold its first official gathering, where worshippers plan to test the limits of new religious freedom laws by \u201cfilling up\u201d the sanctuary with marijuana smoke while observing a sacrament.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a standard service,\u201d Bill Levin, the group\u2019s leader and self-proclaimed \u201cGrand Poohba and Minister of Love,\u201d told ThinkProgress. He explained the ceremony will last around 45 minutes, complete with music and teachings, but will conclude with an unusual benediction: \u201cAt the end of the service \u2026 we will enjoy cannabis, because it\u2019s how we enjoy life.\u201d\n\nRecreational marijuana is, of course, illegal in Indiana. But Levin believes the service will be allowed under the state\u2019s new version of the Religious Freedom and Restoration Act (RFRA), which reaffirmed and arguably expanded existing legal protections for religious groups. The Grand Poohba founded the Church after he heard about the controversial legislation, which sparked a national outcry when it was revealed that it could allow religious groups and individuals the right to discriminate against others \u2014 especially LGBT people. Levin also opposed the legislation, but the same day it was signed into the law, the state approved his request to register his Church as a tax-exempt religious institution.\n\n\u201cThe religious freedom law is, if you have a religion, the government will not impede upon your right for that religion,\u201d Levin, a longtime advocate for the legalization of marijuana, told MSNBC. \u201cAnd as far as I\u2019m concerned, I have a religion [where I] religiously smoke cannabis and I celebrate life.\u201d\n\nAt the end of the service \u2026 we will enjoy cannabis, because it\u2019s how we enjoy life.\n\nLevin\u2019s unique brand of evangelism is resonating powerfully with his rapidly-growing flock. Around 32,000 people have \u201cliked\u201d the Church\u2019s official Facebook page, and more than $10,000 has been donated to the group\u2019s online fundraising campaign, which is collecting donations to lease a worship space and eventually build the \u201cfirst HEMP TEMPLE.\u201d The Church also has a list of 12 founding principles, asking followers (who refer to themselves as \u201cCannaterians\u201d) to refrain from \u201ctrolling\u201d on the internet and insisting \u201cdon\u2019t be an asshole.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe need a modern religion for a modern day,\u201d Levin said.\n\nThe budding tradition\u2019s most influential attribute, however, is likely its final one:\n\n\u201cCannabis, \u2018the Healing Plant\u2019 is our sacrament,\u201d the website reads. \u201cIt brings us closer to ourselves and others. It is our fountain of health, our love, curing us from illness and depression. We embrace it with our whole heart and spirit, individually and as a group.\u201d\n\nDespite the Church\u2019s fierce convictions, existing federal legal precedent makes it unclear whether their holy toking will be permitted under Indiana\u2019s RFRA. The federal version of RFRA was created in response to a case where Native Americans were denied the right to smoke peyote during a religious ritual, but courts have thus far resisted First Amendment claims from new religious groups that focus primarily on drug use. In 2010, a federal circuit court dismissed the case of United States v. Quaintance, where the Church of Cognizance argued that their consumption of marijuana was authorized under RFRA because they consider cannabis both a deity and a sacrament. The panel of judges ruled the group had failed to prove that their beliefs were \u201csincerely held\u201d in a religious sense, concluding that their motives were more business-oriented than spiritually-centered.\n\nBut that was 2010, before the Supreme Court broadened its interpretation of RFRA to grant craft giant Hobby Lobby the ability to opt out of aspects of the Affordable Care Act. That decision has led to several district courts overturning previous decisions that struck down RFRA defenses, reigniting old debates over the nature of religious liberty. More importantly, even though LGBT rights advocates successfully lobbied to amend Indiana\u2019s RFRA to prohibit discrimination, the state\u2019s law is still possibly broader than its federal cousin, potentially paving the way for the Church of Cannabis to win approval for their rituals.\n\nFor the time being, Levin told ThinkProgress he was more concerned with organizing his service than looming legal battles. Still, he doesn\u2019t hide the fact that the timing of the ritual \u2014 July 1 \u2014 is strategic: it\u2019s the same day Indiana\u2019s RFRA is scheduled to take effect. He added that he doesn\u2019t expect the service to be impeded, but if he gets legal pushback, he\u2019s willing to muster a \u201cteam of lawyers\u201d to fight for his new religion\u2019s freedoms.\n\n\u201cWill I take this to the highest court of the land? You betcha,\u201d Levin said.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "\u201cWe need a modern religion for a modern day.\u201d", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "\u201cWe need a modern religion for a modern day.\u201d", "title": "How The First Church Of Cannabis Plans To Test Indiana\u2019s New Religious Freedom Law", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/justice/2015/05/15/3659687/first-church-cannabis-plans-test-indianas-new-religious-freedom-law/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/AP534576372556.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "\u201cWe need a modern religion for a modern day.\u201d", "creator": "@jackmjenkins", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/AP534576372556-321x214.jpg", "title": "How The First Church Of Cannabis Plans To Test Indiana\u2019s New Religious Freedom Law", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-justice", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/AP534576372556.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/AP534576372556.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2015-05-15T15:36:47+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/jackiswriting"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe046b\"", "article_summary": "Justice How The First Church Of Cannabis Plans To Test Indiana\u2019s New Religious Freedom Law CREDIT: AP Photo/Elaine ThompsonFor thousands of years, religious people have gathered together in houses of worship to sing songs, celebrate sacred rituals, and lift up prayers to God(s) on high.\nBut Levin believes the service will be allowed under the state\u2019s new version of the Religious Freedom and Restoration Act (RFRA), which reaffirmed and arguably expanded existing legal protections for religious groups.\n\u201cThe religious freedom law is, if you have a religion, the government will not impede upon your right for that religion,\u201d Levin, a longtime advocate for the legalization of marijuana, told MSNBC.\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a standard service,\u201d Bill Levin, the group\u2019s leader and self-proclaimed \u201cGrand Poohba and Minister of Love,\u201d told ThinkProgress.\nLevin also opposed the legislation, but the same day it was signed into the law, the state approved his request to register his Church as a tax-exempt religious institution."}
