Oil slumped anew and metals prices hit fresh lows this week, signaling mounting investor concern about the pace of global growth and commoditiesâ€™ value as an investment class. Copper and silver, both used in electronics, sank to six-year lows. Gold fell to a five-year low and U.S. oil entered a bear market, prompting Goldman Sachs, for one, to predict prices would drop below $1,000a troy ounce for the first time in more than six years.

The slide was echoed across commodity markets, witinvestors braced for a stronger dollar amid signals from the Federal Reserve of a U.S. rate increase this year.
