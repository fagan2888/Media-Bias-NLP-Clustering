President Barack Obama attacked Fox News again on Tuesday, saying during a panel discussion on poverty at Georgetown University that the news channel perpetuates negative stereotypes of the poor."I think the effort to suggest the poor are sponges, leeches, don't want to work, are lazy, are undeserving, got traction," Obama said. "And, look, it's still being propagated. I have to say if you watch Fox News on a regular basis, it is a constant menu."Fox finds people who make even him mad, the president said."I don’t know where they find them. They're all just like, 'I don't want to work; I just want a free Obamaphone,' or whatever. And that becomes an entire narrative that gets worked up," he said.Rarely is there an interview with a waitress with children who is working hard, but still can't pay the bills, he said.He suggested that the only way to change the thinking of Republican leaders such as House Speaker John Boehner or Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell – or the body politic in general – is to "change how the media reports on these issues and how people's impressions of what it's like to struggle in this economy looks like."Looking at how budgets connect to that is a "hard process," Obama said, because that requires a "much broader conversation than typically we have on the nightly news."
