High blood pressure, high cholesterol and obesity are rampant.\n\nResearcher LaVonne Hill said that identifying the issues means that they can now be addressed.\n\nThe health-care assessment of north Palm Springs strove to answer three questions:\n\n\u2022 What are the main health conditions in the community?\n\n\u2022 How do residents access health care?\n\n\u2022 What community resources are available and needed?\n\nThe findings were presented Tuesday night in the gymnasium at a north Palm Springs community center. The meeting drew roughly two dozen community members.\n\nNorth Palm Springs, also known as the Desert Highland Gateway, consists of about 480 households. Most residents are African-American, and there is a high rate of unemployment. Many of the men have been arrested or served time behind bars.\n\nIn the study, 307 north Palm Springs residents were surveyed.\n\nResearchers suggested workshops on the Affordable Care Act, classes on disease management and the formation of a community wellness committee. They advocate better public transportation, more free- or low-cost dental and vision care, job training and substance-abuse programs.\n\nTrained by Loma Linda University Health and El Sol Neighborhood Educational Center, several north Palm Springs residents conducted the study. They did the interviews.\n\nOne of them, Natalie Edwards, 38, has lived in north Palm Springs her whole life and was glad to see the area studied.\n\n\u201cThis community is really overlooked,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen they come out and do other types of health assessments or anything to do with Palm Springs, they tend to bypass us and go into other communities instead of helping this community, where it\u2019s most needed.\u201d\n\nContact the writer: 951-368-9552 or ewaldner@pe.com", "article_metadata": {"geo.region": "US-CA", "sailthru.author": "ERIN WALDNER", "content_author": "ERIN WALDNER", "ICBM": "33.948100, -117.396100", "sailthru.tags": "news, care, health, community, palm, north, springs, issues, residents, high, study", "content_section": "news", "content_title": "PALM SPRINGS: Study IDs health issues", "geo.position": "33.948100;-117.396100", "author": "ERIN WALDNER", "section": "news", "sailthru.date": "2014-08-06 16:40:41", "sailthru.title": "PALM SPRINGS: Study IDs health issues", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/n9wsis-b88158394z.120140806164041000g2a44mg3.10.jpg", "geo.placename": "Riverside", "fb": {"app_id": 1413700038878423}, "content_thumbnail": "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/n9wsis-b88158394z.120140806164041000g2a44mg3.10.jpg", "content_type": "article", "publication_date": "2014-08-06", "Description": "News: Study IDs health issues in north Palm Springs | care, health, community, palm, north, springs, issues, residents, high, study", "og": {"site_name": "Press Enterprise", "description": "News: Study IDs health issues in north Palm Springs | care, health, community, palm, north, springs, issues, residents, high, study", "title": "PALM SPRINGS: Study IDs health issues", "locale": "en", "image": "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/article/n9wsis-b88158394z.120140806164041000g2a44mg3.10.jpg", "url": "http://www.pe.com/articles/care-698463-health-community.html", "type": "article"}, "Keywords": "care, health, community, palm, north, springs, issues, residents, high, study", "sailthru.image.full": "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/n9wsis-b88158394z.120140806164041000g2a44mg3.10.jpg"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdea10\"", "article_summary": "PALM SPRINGS: Study IDs health issues Share Pin It 1 of 3 More Galleries Four local residents participate in a community health meeting Aug. 5 at the James O.
