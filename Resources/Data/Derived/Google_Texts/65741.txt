The scientist who used to run a now-defunct government program that tried to leverage psychics to mine defense intelligence is still conducting extrasensory perception (ESP) experiments and defends his past experience with the program, according to a newly-published story in Newsweek.

Edwin May, the scientist who had been running the government’s ESP research program before it was ended in 1995, told the news magazine that ESP has “already been proved,” and former Sen. William Cohen of Maine, who was Defense Secretary under former President Clinton, also spoke positively of the idea, according to the story.

“I was impressed with the concept of remote viewing,” Mr. Cohen told Newsweek in an email. “The results may not have been consistent enough to constitute ‘actionable intelligence,’ but exploration of the power of the mind was and remains an important endeavor.”

Ray Hyman of the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry, who met Mr. May in the 1970s, was tapped by the CIA in 1995 to evaluate the “Star Gate” program. The intelligence agency report criticized Mr. May for serving as both “judge and jury” on the ESP tests, though Mr. Hyman acknowledges now that Mr. May is a “smart,” “talented” guy.

Mr. May is continuing to do experiments, including work with Joseph McMoneagle, who began “remote viewing” for the government in 1978, the story said.
