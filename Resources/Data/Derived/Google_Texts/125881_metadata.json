As weak as that growth was, it\u2019s also slightly better than the revised growth rate of 0.1 percent in the second quarter of the year. Compared with the same quarter in 2013, the Euro area economy has grown 0.8 percent.\n\nRelated: Why America Voted Against Obama\u2019s Economy\n\n\u201cGrowth in the euro area is still very low, but a slight beat of the consensus and an upward revision to last quarter\u2019s data indicate that the economy is further from recession than a gloomy consensus was expecting,\u201d Claus Vistesen, chief Eurozone economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, wrote Friday, providing the chart below to illustrate the point.\n\nGermany\n\nThe German economy, the largest in the Eurozone, grew 0.1 percent in the most recent quarter after contracting by roughly the same amount in the previous three months. \u201cIn other words, Euroland\u2019s dominant economy has not grown at all in six months,\u201d Carl B. Weinberg, chief economist at High Frequency Economics, said in a note to clients. For now, though, it looks as if Germany has avoided a triple-dip recession.\n\nFrance\n\nFrench GDP expanded by 0.3 percent quarter over quarter, slightly better than economists had expected \u2014 and the best quarterly growth since 2011. The details of the report were less encouraging than the headline though, as the growth was helped by a rise in government spending and companies replenishing their inventories. Investment spending, meanwhile, shrank by 0.6 percent as the private sector in France still appears mired its post-crisis malaise.\n\nRelated: Two New Signs the U.S. Economy Really Is Getting Better\n\nItaly\n\nItaly is technically back in recession, with GDP shrinking for two consecutive quarters after coming in flat over the first three months of the year. Italian GDP fell 0.1 percent in the third quarter and by 0.2 percent in the second quarter. Italy\u2019s GDP has not grown for 13 straight quarters.\n\nGreece\n\nBy contrast, the recession in Greece just ended after nearly six long years. Greek GDP growth accelerated to 0.7 percent quarter over quarter, up from 0.3 percent. The Greek economy grew by 1.4 percent from the third quarter of 2013 to the same period this year.\n\nOthers\n\nPoland\u2019s GDP grew by 0.9 percent, best among Europe\u2019s seven largest economies. The U.K. expanded by 0.7 percent and Spain saw 0.5 percent growth. See the full table below.\n\nThe bottom line: Europe isn\u2019t in recession, but it also still isn\u2019t growing much. \u201cNo one can look at this report and call Euroland\u2019s economy anything better than stagnant,\u201d Weinberg wrote.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "About the best thing you can say about the Eurozone economy is that it\u2019s not in recess", "title": "The Eurozone Economy: Not in Recession, but Still a Mess", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2014/11/14/Eurozone-Economy-Not-Recession-Still-Mess", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/05112010_europeancentral_bank_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2014/11/14/Eurozone-Economy-Not-Recession-Still-Mess", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/05112010_europeancentral_bank_article.jpg", "creator": "@yuvalrosenberg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "About the best thing you can say about the Eurozone economy is that it\u2019s not in recess", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "About the best thing you can say about the Eurozone economy is that it\u2019s not in recession.\nThe Greek economy grew by 1.4 percent from the third quarter of 2013 to the same period this year.\nGermanyThe German economy, the largest in the Eurozone, grew 0.1 percent in the most recent quarter after contracting by roughly the same amount in the previous three months.\nGreek GDP growth accelerated to 0.7 percent quarter over quarter, up from 0.3 percent.\n\u201cNo one can look at this report and call Euroland\u2019s economy anything better than stagnant,\u201d Weinberg wrote."}
