Kenneth Simon Center for Principles and Politics at The Heritage Foundation.\n\nJim DeMint, a former U.S. senator and the president of The Heritage Foundation, praised the organization.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s critically important that the next generation be ready for productive careers and informed citizenship in these challenging times,\u201d said DeMint. \u201cThe American Council of Trustees and Alumni is working tirelessly to ensure that tomorrow\u2019s leaders graduate from college with the skills, knowledge, judgment and character on which our nation\u2019s future so greatly depends.\u201d\n\nThe Council evaluated the curriculums of almost 1,100 American colleges and universities, public and private, without regard for the school\u2019s \u201cprestige or wealth or reputation.\u201d Their goal was to make the information \u201ceasily available to college-bound students, parents, high school guidance counselors and higher education policymakers.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat are all students required to study in order to earn a given school\u2019s diploma? How will that institution\u2019s faculty and administration guide a young person to acquire the fundamental tools of success in career and community life?\u201d American Council of Trustees and Alumni asked.\n\nHeritage\u2019s Azerrad praised the Council\u2019s dedication to studying the requirements of each institution in \u201cseven core subjects: English composition, literature, foreign language, U.S. government or history, economics, mathematics and science.\u201d\n\nAzerrad commended American Council of Trustees and Alumni for their creation of a national database of 18,000 trustees, enabling students, parents and educators to send them the information directly. Some of the trustees are now working with the Council to improve the core requirements at their school.\n\nAmerican Council of Trustees and Alumni, said Azerrad, found a way to give trustees the knowledge they need to enact real change.\n\nThe Heritage Foundation awards the Salvatori Prize annually to an individual, group or organization who promote the principles and virtues of the American Founding, and are examples of independent and entrepreneurial citizenship.\n\nThe award is named for Henry Salvatori, an entrepreneur and philanthropist. Salvatori immigrated to the United States from Italy during his childhood and went on to found the Western Geophysical Company and become a conservative activist.\n\nIn 2014, the Salvatori Prize was awarded to the Green and the Hahn families, who own Hobby Lobby and Conestoga Wood Specialties, who fought in court Obamacare\u2019s so-called \u201cHHS mandate\u201d requiring that they provide abortifacient drugs in employee health care plans.\n\nPast recipients of the Salvatori Prize also include historian David McCullough, the Mount Vernon Ladies\u2019 Association and neurosurgeon Ben Carson.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The group's work on education was praised.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The group's work on education was praised.", "title": "2015 Salvatori Prize Awarded to American Council of Trustees and Alumni", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/salvatori.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-05-08T13:37:51+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1JSQNC8"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The group's work on education was praised.", "title": "2015 Salvatori Prize Awarded to American Council of Trustees and Alumni", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/salvatori.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Society", "tag": "founding principles", "published_time": "2015-05-07T20:13:17+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-05-08T13:37:51+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "The Heritage Foundation has awarded its 2015 Salvatori Prize for American Citizenship to the American Council of Trustees and Alumni for their \u201cWhat Will They Learn\u201d initiative, which aims to promote rigorous academic standards in higher education.\nAmerican Council of Trustees and Alumni, said Azerrad, found a way to give trustees the knowledge they need to enact real change.\nPast recipients of the Salvatori Prize also include historian David McCullough, the Mount Vernon Ladies\u2019 Association and neurosurgeon Ben Carson.\nHow will that institution\u2019s faculty and administration guide a young person to acquire the fundamental tools of success in career and community life?\u201d American Council of Trustees and Alumni asked.\nJim DeMint, a former U.S. senator and the president of The Heritage Foundation, praised the organization."}
