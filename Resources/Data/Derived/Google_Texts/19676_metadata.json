Jones reportedly told Moore that his faction was no longer welcome in the Sunday Assembly movement.\n\nMoore promises that his group, Godless Revival, will be more firmly atheistic than the Sunday Assembly, which he now dismisses as \u201ca humanistic cult.\u201d\n\nIn a recent interview, Jones described the split as \u201cvery sad.\u201d But, he added, \u201cultimately, it is for the benefit of the community. One day, I hope there will soon be communities for every different type of atheist, agnostic and humanist. We are only one flavor of ice cream, and one day we hope there'll be congregations for every godless palate.\"\n\nNevertheless, the New York schism raises critical questions about the Sunday Assembly. Namely: Can the atheist church model survive? Is disbelief enough to keep a Sunday gathering together?\n\nBig-tent atheism\n\nI attended my first service last April, when Sunday Assembly was still a rag-tag venture in East London.\n\nThe service was held in a crumbly, deconsecrated church and largely populated by white 20-somethings with long hair and baggy spring jackets (a group from which I hail.)\n\nI wrote that the Assembly \u201chad a wayward, whimsical feel. At a table by the door, ladies served homemade cakes and tea. The house band played Cat Stevens. Our \u2018priest\u2019 wore pink skinny jeans.\u201d\n\nI judged the effort to be \u201cpart quixotic hipster start-up, part Southern megachurch.\u201d\n\nThe central idea was attractive enough. The Assembly described itself as a secular urban oasis, where atheists could enjoy the benefits of traditional church - the sense of community, the weekly sermon, the scheduled time for reflection, the community service opportunities, the ethos of self-improvement, the singing and the free food - without God. I liked the vibe and the slogan: \u201cLive Better, Help Often, Wonder More.\u201d\n\nShortly thereafter, Assembly services began bringing in hundreds of similarly warm-and-fuzzy nonbelievers. The wee East London church grew too small, and the Assembly moved to central London\u2019s more elegant Conway Hall.\n\nThe Assembly drew criticism, to be sure\u2014from atheists who fundamentally object to organized disbelief, from theists who resent the pillaging of their texts and traditions. But coverage was largely positive - and it was everywhere.\n\nIn September, a second wave of coverage peaked, with news that the Assembly was franchising: across England, Scotland, Ireland, Canada, the United States and Australia. That month, the founders launched a crowd-funding campaign that aims to raise $802,500. (As of mid-December, less than $56,000 had been raised.)\n\nStill, prospective Sunday Assembly franchisers seemed exhilarated. Los Angeles chapter founder Ian Dodd enthused that he would \u201chave a godless congregation in the city of angels.\u201d In November, his inaugural Assembly drew more than 400 attendees.\n\nBut as the atheist church grew, it began to change\u2014and to move away from its atheism.\n\n\u201cHow atheist should our Assembly be?\u201d wrote Jones in August. \u201cThe short answer to that is: not very.\u201d\n\nPippa Evans, Assembly\u2019s other co-founder, elaborated: \u201c\u2018Atheist Church\u2019 as a phrase has been good to us. It has got us publicity. But the term \u2018atheist\u2019 does hold negative connotations.\u201d\n\nWarm-and-fuzzy atheism gave way to not-quite atheism: or at least a very subdued, milquetoast nonbelief. Sunday services made much mention of \u201cwhizziness\u201d and \u201cwonder\u201d\u2014but rarely spoke of God\u2019s nonexistence.\n\nThe newer, bigger Sunday Assembly now markets itself as a kind of atheist version of Unitarian Univeralism: irreligious, but still eager to include everyone.\n\nIn a way, this is a smart move. According to the 2012 Pew Forum on Religion & Public Life, 20% of Americans have no religious affiliation, but just a fraction of those identify as atheists.\n\nA godless congregation is likely to draw crowds if it appeals to what Herb Silverman, founder of the Secular Coalition for America, calls \u201cbig-tent\u201d atheism, which includes \u201cagnostics, humanists, secular humanists, freethinkers, nontheists, anti-theists, skeptics, rationalists, naturalists, materialists, ignostics, apatheists, and more.\u201d\n\nBut atheists who wanted a firmly atheist church\u2014a Sunday Assembly where categorical disbelief is discussed and celebrated\u2014will not be satisfied.\n\nAs the Sunday Assembly downplays its atheism, it also appears increasingly churchlike.\n\nStarting a Sunday Assembly chapter now involves a \u201cSunday Assembly Everywhere accreditation process,\u201d which grants \u201cthe right to use all the Sunday Assembly materials, logos, positive vibe and goodwill.\u201d\n\nAspiring Sunday Assembly founders must form legal entities and attend \u201ctraining days in the UK,\u201d sign the Sunday Assembly Charter and pass a three- to six-month peer review. Only then may formal accreditation be granted.\n\nThis is not an East London hipster hyper-localism anymore.\n\nSelling swag and charisma\n\nOrganized atheism is not necessarily new. French Revolutionaries, for instance, were early atheist entrepreneurs.\n\nIn 1793, secularists famously seized the Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris, to build a \u201cTemple of Reason.\u201d They decorated the church with busts of philosophers, built an altar to Reason, lit a torch of Truth - and brought in an actress to play Liberty.\n\nA half-century later, French philosopher Auguste Comte drew acclaim for his \u201creligion of humanity,\u201d which imagined an army of secular sages ministering to secular souls. London has hosted formal atheist gatherings for almost as long.\n\nHistory suggests, then, that there is nothing inherently anti-organization about atheism. As Assembly\u2019s Sanderson Jones puts it, \u201cthings which are organized are not necessarily bad.\u201d\n\nTo be sure, Sunday Assembly members in the United States say they've long wanted to join atheist congregations.\n\nIan Dodd, a 50-something camera operator in Los Angeles, had long been a member of the Unitarian Universalist Church; he enjoyed it, but wanted something more explicitly irreligious.\n\nNicole Steeves of the Chicago chapter found herself yearning for a secular community\u2014a \u201cplace to check in and think about things bigger than the day-to-day\u201d\u2014after having her first child.\n\nBut it is one thing to support an atheist \"church\" - where the \u2018c\u2019 is small and the effort is local - and another to back an atheist \u2018Church\u2019 that is global and centralized.\n\nThe former responds directly to the needs and fancies of its community. The latter assumes that its particular brand of disbelief is universally relevant\u2014and worthy of trademark.\n\nCentralized atheism also feeds hungrily on charisma, and Sanderson Jones, who resembles a tall, bearded messiah - and who, despite the SA recommendation that Assembly hosts should be regularly rotated, dominates each London service - provides ample fuel.\n\nBut it remains to be seen whether the Sunday Assembly\u2019s diluted godlessness is meaty enough to sustain a flock.\n\n\u201cBecause it is a godless congregation, we don\u2019t have a doctrine to rely on,\u201d explains Sunday Assembly Melbourne\u2019s founder, \u201cso we take reference from everything in the world.\u201d\n\nSo far, Assembly sermonizers had included community workers, physicists, astronomers, wine writers, topless philanthropers, futurologists, happiness experts, video game enthusiasts, historians and even a vicar. The pulpit is open indeed.\n\nMy own misgivings are far less academic. I\u2019m simply not getting what the Sunday Assembly promised. I\u2019m not put off by the secular church model, but rather the prototype.\n\nTake an October service in London, for example:\n\nInstead of a thoughtful sermon, I got a five-minute Wikipedia-esque lecture on the history of particle physics.\n\nInstead of receiving self-improvement nudges or engaging in conversation with strangers, I watched the founders fret (a lot) over technical glitches with the web streaming, talk about how hard they had worked to pull the service off, and try to sell me Sunday Assembly swag.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, instead of just hop, skipping and jumping over to a local venue, as I once did, I now had to brave the tube and traverse the city.\n\nBack in New York, Lee Moore is gearing up for the launch of Godless Revival - but still speaks bitterly of his time with the Sunday Assembly network.\n\nOver the telephone, I mused that the experience must have quashed any ambition he ever had to build a multinational atheist enterprise.\n\n\u201cActually,\u201d he admitted, \u201cwe do have expansion aims.\u201d\n\nKatie Engelhart is a London-based writer.
