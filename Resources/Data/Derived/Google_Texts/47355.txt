A nearly four decade-long tradition is celebrating its most successful year yet.

The 38th Annual Greek Fest wrapped up Saturday at St. John the Theologian Greek Orthodox Church after a weekend of food, fun and celebration of Greek culture.

Several hundred people came by to support the event.

Organizers say it was so successful, they ran out of food early Saturday afternoon for the first time in the festival's history.

Money raised from food sales goes back to the church, and they donate silent auction funds to local charities.

'We've just had an amazing response," Parish Council Vice President Kalliope Bryant said. "People are just so excited to be here, and I just hope they were pleased with the service and the food. We put so much love and effort in our food anyway."

Bryant is just one of only ten church members who organized the event.

They begin preparing frozen food for the festival as early as August.

Next year Bryant hopes to include local vendors and more entertainment in the festival.
