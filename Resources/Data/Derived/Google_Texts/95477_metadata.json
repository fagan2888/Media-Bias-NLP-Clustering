One is that health care has never been more accessible and that any increase in cost is negligible. The other perspective points out massive increases in cost, doctors leaving the system and insurance companies starting to abandon a sinking ship. It's as if fans of the Affordable Care Act live in a different world than everyone else. At least both sides agree things are changing.\n\nIn the Minot area, there is definitely a change coming in terms of health care. Or rather, changes and it's a good idea that people prepare for whatever that change may bring.\n\nWe know that longtime landmark health-care provider Trinity Health has a big change in its sites. This summer, architectural work will be under way for its proposed new campus in southwest Minot. However, until then, the cost of the planned opening won't even be known, leaving Trinity in position to then make the financial plans to see the dream realized.\n\nMeanwhile, Sanford Health continues to assert its interests in the Minot market and apparently has its eye on a sizable location not far from the proposed Trinity site. Sanford, with its deep pockets and pattern of partnering with other providers in many of the markets it enters, is in no hurry to make a move. With the regional economy in a standstill and a national election that could certainly impact health care on the horizon, it's little surprise Sanford is waiting to make its best possible move.\n\nAlso recently, CHI St. Alexius expanded its footprint in Minot.\n\nCan Minot support all the institutions with plans here? What if the economy doesn't quickly bounce back? Is there a possibility of a partnership somehow?\n\nFact Box TODAY'S TOPIC Health care OUR VIEW Be ready for change\n\nThere are plenty of questions when it comes to health care in Minot. Only a seer could know all of the answers. But one thing is certain there is change in the wind.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Minot, North Dakota, Dekota, newspaper, daily, Minot Air Force, b52, Minute Men, Great Plains, Mouse River, Minot Air Force Base, B-52H Stratofortress bombers,5th Bomb Wing, 91st Missile Wing ,150 Minuteman III Inter-Continental Ballistic Missiles (ICBMs)", "description": "Listen to the national talking heads discuss health care and you see two distinct positions."}, "article_summary": "Fact Box TODAY'S TOPIC Health care OUR VIEW Be ready for changeThere are plenty of questions when it comes to health care in Minot.\nIn the Minot area, there is definitely a change coming in terms of health care.\nOne is that health care has never been more accessible and that any increase in cost is negligible.\nListen to the national talking heads discuss health care and you see two distinct positions.\nWe know that longtime landmark health-care provider Trinity Health has a big change in its sites."}
