(Photo: Omar Ornelas/Desert Sun )\n\nThe Mourning Star Center, a Palm Desert-based program offering free grief support for hundreds of children, teens and families, is closing its doors at the end of the month and laying off its employees.\n\nThe closure stems from a decision by the Visiting Nurse Association of the Inland Counties, the in-home nursing and medical care organization that operates the program, to defund it.\n\n\"Because of all the changes within health care, we need to focus on our core services, which is home care services and palliative care,\" VNAIC CEO Mike Rusnak said. \"All the changes in reimbursement, the Affordable Care Act, sequestration and the recession have all taken a toll.\"\n\nRusnak said it was a very difficult decision the board made to keep the VNA going forward. He said it's hard to raise money to support a program of Mourning Star's size, but they are continuing to look for a solution.\n\n\"It's a wonderful program,\" he said. \"It's certainly one we're hoping we can resurrect or transition to or (find a) partner we can continue along with.\"\n\nMore than a dozen family members who attended Mourning Star rallied Monday morning to save the counseling. Donning T-shirts with the faces and names of husbands, fathers and grandchildren who have died, they carried signs with messages, waving them at honking passersby: \"Have a heart \u2014 Fund children's grief.\" \"Don't take our angels away.\"\n\nOne boy held a sign with a family photo, \"I miss my daddy. Please don't take away our grieving group, too.\"\n\n\"We're devastated,\" said Jennifer Wheeler Loza, who said she was officially told the news on Friday.\n\n\"Mourning Star has quite literally saved my family in so many ways,\" she said. \"(My children) have a place where they're home. They have a place where they're safe. They have a place where they can share what they feel without being judged.\"\n\nLoza's husband passed away two and a half years ago at the age of 44 from a blood clot that spread to his heart. Her children, 9 and 18 at the time, and her niece started attending support groups at the center. She said they learned how to know what they're feeling and deal with their grief in a way kids can \u2014 by playing and being with others who understand them.\n\nLoza has laid on the floor crying, not knowing if she will make it another day, and but her \"family\" at the center picked her up and carried by her.\n\n\"You walk in with the weight of the world on your shoulders, and you leave feeling invincible,\" she said.\n\nNow her son is crying at the thought of not being able to go back to see his counselors and friends who carried them through one of the hardest times in their lives.\n\nFamilies protest on Cook Street and Merle Drive the closure of The Mourning Star Center, a program offering free support for hundreds of children, teen and families grieving the loss of a loved one.

To help with healing, they're asked to do things like draw what their life was like before and after a person died; some draw rainbows and sunshine, followed by darkness and gloom. Some light candles with personalized messages to their parents, friends and relatives that have died. Others play basketball or just sit and talk about their school days and how they're handling everything.\n\nThe programs ran every other week for nine months.\n\nThe center also has school groups and deploys counselors to children outside of its program when tragedy strikes.\n\nThe charity ran in sites throughout Riverside and San Bernardino counties, and three locations \u2014 Riverside, Victorville and Palm Desert \u2014 are closing by the end of August, sources say.\n\nRusnak said Camp Erin, a summer camp set up by the Moyer Foundation in 2002, will continue.\n\nJacqueline Thomas, who has volunteered at the center and Camp Erin for mourning teens for four years, said grief can be deeper and harder for children. People don't truly know what to expect when a child's family member dies or understand how they will cope, especially because they have to grow up faster and in a different way than their peers.\n\n\"You go through all the different stages of your life without that person,\" she said.\n\nWidows at the Mourning Star rally said some of their kids' peers would assume they were \"over\" the death of their parents after a certain time had passed or not understand why they only had one parent; they felt like an island. Going to the center made them feel normal and gave families tools to get through the pain.\n\nSome said they weren't equipped to help their relatives because they were dealing with their own grief, so the center stepped in.\n\nFamily members are currently compiling testimonial letters to send to possible funders in the hopes that another nonprofit might incorporate it or someone might be able to pay for the services.\n\nLoza said they are determined to do anything they can to save the center \u2014 including finding the roughly $250,000 each year needed to fund Mourning Star.\n\nThe nonprofit operated on a $700,000 budget, according to 2012 numbers from the GuideStar Exchange. VNAIC's 2012 numbers reflected $71,133,248 in revenue with $66,715,727 in expenses.\n\nCharity events over the years, including the Pathway to Healing fundraising luncheon last March, aimed to pick up donations to keep the program afloat. The H.N. and Frances C. Berger Foundation donated a $25,000 grant to the center in 2010, part of an effort to combat the recession and unemployment's effects on valley charities.\n\nRusnak said it had never been able to be \"self-sustaining.\"\n\n\"They should have started a long time ago to try and save it,\" Thomas said. \"The community should have been involved.\n\n\"If the CEO ... knew it was maybe in jeopardy, I feel like us as volunteers and even family members should have had the chance to be involved to help save our center because we're also personally invested in it,\" she said.\n\n\"We want the chance to save it.\"\n\nMourning Star attendees said this is the only site like it in the valley for children in this position; there's therapy and personalized grief therapists but no community-based programs for children that go out to schools \u2014 and is free.\n\nWhen Lydia Whitaker's husband died two years ago, she thought she would never see her kids, Will and Grace, laugh or smile again.\n\nBut they did, down the hallways in the center. There's no other place like it locally, she said, for them to learn to handle their intense emotions.\n\n\"There is little for the niche of children who are grieving,\" she said. \"(The center) is the only thing here in the valley for children trying to learn how to live with grief.\"\n\nJessica Pourte was the group coordinator at Mourning Star Palm Desert until two weeks ago when she was terminated. She said she hopes people are working together to try to save it, because it means so much to so many people. She said that just at her branch, they saw 120 kids every two weeks and about 80 children through school groups.\n\n\"The families, the kids and teens who don't have a voice or are silent grievers, they're often the people who are forgotten about,\" she said. \"This program was just amazing and gave children and families a chance to be heard and have somebody walk alongside them on their grief journey.\"\n\nChloe Rodriguez, 12, of Indio lost her brother more than a year ago when the 20-year-old Robert died of meningitis. She said she'd found a place where she could express herself, share her feelings and find healing.\n\nWhen Rodriguez found out the center was closing, she said it broke her.\n\n\"It's like losing someone again, losing Mourning Star,\" she said.\n\nDesert Sun health care reporter Victoria Pelham can be reached at (760) 778-4649, victoria.pelham@desertsun.com and on Twitter @vpelham.\n\nAbout Mourning Star Center\n\n\u2022 Offered support groups, counseling, school groups and trauma response to children and families grieving the loss of loved ones.\n\n\u2022 In Palm Desert for almost 20 years, serving roughly 200 children.\n\n\u2022 Visiting Nurse Association of the Inland Counties, which operates the program, has decided to defund it because it's not \"self-sustaining.\"\n\n\u2022 More than a dozen families rallied Monday to try to save Mourning Star and are trying to fundraise to keep the program alive.\n\nIf you'd like to help\n\n\u2022 Donate to the cause through gofundme.\n\n\u2022 Visit the Facebook fundraising page to learn more.\n\n\u2022 Contact Jennifer Wheeler Loza at jenloza@verizon.net.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://desert.sn/VgjyRW", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "The Mourning Star Center, a program offering free support for hundreds of children, teens and families grieving the loss of a loved one in Palm Desert, is closing its doors at the end of the month and laying off its employees.", "og": {"site_name": "Desert Sun", "description": "The Mourning Star Center, a program offering free support for hundreds of children, teens and families grieving the loss of a loved one in Palm Desert, is closing its doors at the end of the month and laying off its employees.", "title": "Mourning Star Center in Palm Desert to close", "url": "http://www.desertsun.com/story/news/health/2014/08/11/mourning-star-palm-desert-closes/13908739/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/desertsun.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The Mourning Star Center, a program offering free support for hundreds of children, teens and families grieving the loss of a loved one in Palm Desert, is closing its doors at the end of the month and laying off its employees.", "creator": "@mydesert", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/800630dd5c616c29b25d84b5459b406cf02d6db4/c=960-0-4800-3840&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/PalmSprings/2014/08/11/mourningstar1.jpg", "title": "Mourning Star Center in Palm Desert to close", "site": "@mydesert", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600074187", "fb": {"app_id": 116853348383382}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070"}, "article_summary": "Jessica Pourte was the group coordinator at Mourning Star Palm Desert until two weeks ago when she was terminated.\nAbout Mourning Star Center\u2022 Offered support groups, counseling, school groups and trauma response to children and families grieving the loss of loved ones.\n\"Mourning Star has quite literally saved my family in so many ways,\" she said.\nMore than a dozen family members who attended Mourning Star rallied Monday morning to save the counseling.\n\u2022 More than a dozen families rallied Monday to try to save Mourning Star and are trying to fundraise to keep the program alive."}
