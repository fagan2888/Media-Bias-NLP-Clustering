The efforts of the initiative will require the federal government to partner with various organizations, including charitable organizations, faith-based organizations, the private and local sectors, and state and tribal governments.\n\n\u201cThe United States enjoys the most productive and abundant food supply on earth, but too much of this food goes to waste,\u201d said Vilsack in the USDA\u2019s official announcement.\n\nAccording to the USDA news release, \u201c[e]xperts have projected that reducing food losses by just 15 percent would provide enough food for more than 25 million Americans every year, helping to sharply reduce incidences of food insecurity for millions.\u201d\n\nHowever, there are questions as to why these issues have remained at the forefront of American policy goals.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s ironic that the USDA is so concerned with food waste. If they wanted to make a difference, they would get rid of their inflexible school meal standards that has led to tons of food waste and disrespected local communities, parents, and students,\u201d said Daren Bakst, a research fellow in agricultural policy at The Heritage Foundation.\n\n\u201cIf we are concerned about food availability, our focus should be on food prices, as we saw with recent food riots in other countries,\u201d Bakst added. \u201cPolicies that drive up food prices are irresponsible. Climate change policies, which drive up energy costs for agricultural producers, are the poster child of this irresponsible action.\u201d\n\nEPA Administrator Gina McCarthy expressed positive sentiments over the initiative.\n\nIn a statement, McCarthy said, \u201cLet\u2019s feed people, not landfills. By reducing wasted food in landfills, we cut harmful methane emissions that fuel climate change, conserve our natural resources, and protect our planet for future generations.\u201d\n\nThe federal government has made strides in the past to conserve food and reduce waste. The USDA and EPA launched the U.S. Food Waste Challenge in 2013, which encouraged organizations and leaders to contribute the most efficient practices on reducing, recycling, and recovering food loss and waste.\n\nThe U.S. Food Waste Challenge had an initial goal of engaging 1,000 participants. It engaged more than 4,000 participants by the end of 2014.\n\nThe USDA has even introduced an app, called \u201cFoodKeeper,\u201d to further its food waste reduction efforts. According to the iOS app description, \u201cFoodKeeper can help consumers use food while at peak quality and reduce waste.\u201d\n\nThe USDA and EPA are also seeking to expand their efforts beyond the federal government by encouraging the private sector to become more aggressive about reducing food loss and waste.\n\nRegarding food waste, Bakst said, \u201cWe aren\u2019t about to run out of food. That doesn\u2019t mean bad policies won\u2019t create food production challenges, such as government-imposed obstacles to technological innovation and climate change policies that will drastically drive up prices for agricultural producers and all Americans.\u201d\n\nThe new environmental goals of the federal government were announced one week before world leaders meet at the U.N. General Assembly in New York. The leaders will be discussing sustainable development practices within food production and consumption.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The U.S. Department of Agriculture has announced an initiative to reduce national food waste by 50 percent by 2030.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The U.S. Department of Agriculture has announced an initiative to reduce national food waste by 50 percent by 2030.", "title": "First Food Waste Reduction Goal Announced", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150923_FoodWaste.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-09-23T18:10:58+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1MmcCZY"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The U.S. Department of Agriculture has announced an initiative to reduce national food waste by 50 percent by 2030.", "title": "First Food Waste Reduction Goal Announced", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150923_FoodWaste.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Energy", "tag": "Agriculture", "published_time": "2015-09-23T16:09:02+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-09-23T18:10:58+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "USDA, EPA, agriculture, food waste, food loss"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca64d\"", "article_summary": "Regarding food waste, Bakst said, \u201cWe aren\u2019t about to run out of food.\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture has announced an initiative to reduce national food waste by 50 percent by 2030.\n\u201cIf we are concerned about food availability, our focus should be on food prices, as we saw with recent food riots in other countries,\u201d Bakst added.\nThe U.S. Food Waste Challenge had an initial goal of engaging 1,000 participants.\nThe USDA has even introduced an app, called \u201cFoodKeeper,\u201d to further its food waste reduction efforts."}
