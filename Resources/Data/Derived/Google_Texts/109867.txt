President Obama on Sunday paid tribute to the late Marion Barry, saying the former Washington, D.C., mayor and councilman made a mark fighting against poverty and spearheading other initiatives that earned him the respect of his city.

Barry died Sunday at the age of 78.

“Michelle and I were saddened to hear of the passing of Marion Barry. Marion was born a sharecropper’s son, came of age during the Civil Rights movement, and became a fixture in D.C. politics for decades. As a leader with the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, Marion helped advanced the cause of civil rights for all,” the president said in a statement. “During his decades in elected office in D.C., he put in place historic programs to lift working people out of poverty, expand opportunity, and begin to make real the promise of home rule.”

“Through a storied, at times tumultuous life and career, he earned the love and respect of countless Washingtonians, and Michelle and I extend our deepest sympathies to Marion’s family, friends and constituents today,” Mr. Obama said.
