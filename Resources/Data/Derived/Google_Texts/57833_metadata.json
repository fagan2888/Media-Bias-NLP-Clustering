I think she won\u2019t be able to go through a campaign without answering that, and people will take it seriously, and it will affect whether they vote for her or don\u2019t vote for her.\u201d Although he added that she may not know what\u2019s in the deal, but once she reads it, she\u2019ll have to take a position.\n\nTrumka was then asked what the political ramifications would be if Hillary took a position \u201csimilar to the one she\u2019s taken in the past when it comes to these big trade deals.\u201d He answered, \u201cIt will be tougher to mobilize working people. It\u2019ll be tougher to get them to come out excited and work to do door-knocking and leafleting and phone-banking and all the things that are going to be necessary for her if she\u2019s the candidate and we would endorse her to get elected. It\u2019ll make it far more difficult.\u201d\n\nInterviewer Susan Page followed-up that since the AFL-CIO won\u2019t endorse a Republican candidate, what the cost would really be if he wasn\u2019t happy with Hillary. He stated, \u201cWell, there\u2019s another alternative as well, you can not endorse for president,\u201d which he said was \u201cconceivable\u201d if \u201cIf both candidates didn\u2019t \u2014 weren\u2019t interested in raising wages and creating jobs. If neither one had a program that we were convinced that they would fight for, not just a poll-tested slogan, but an actual agenda that they will fight for. If we\u2019re convinced that neither candidate has that, then I think we would spend our money elsewhere.\u201d\n\nTrumka concluded that he did \u201crespect\u201d that Hillary had been \u201casking Americans what they want and what they need.\u201d\n\n(h/t GOPICYMI)\n\nFollow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett", "article_metadata": {"description": "AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka said that it was \"conceivable\" the AFL-CIO might not endorse Hillary Clinton", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka said that it was \"conceivable\" the AFL-CIO might not endorse Hillary Clinton", "title": "Trumka: 'Conceivable' We Might Not Endorse Hillary - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 475, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/05/Trumka-528-Thumbnail.jpg", "height": 356}, "updated_time": "2015-05-28T09:29:10-07:00", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/video/2015/05/28/trumka-conceivable-we-might-not-endorse-hillary/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka said that it was \"conceivable\" the AFL-CIO might not endorse Hillary Clinton", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/05/Trumka-528-Thumbnail.jpg", "title": "Trumka: 'Conceivable' We Might Not Endorse Hillary - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "app_id": 1243316582352556, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Hillary Clinton, Obamatrade, Richard Trumka, TPA, TPP,2016 Presidential Race, Breitbart TV, Hillary Clinton,Hillary", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "published_time": "2015-05-28T09:18:12-07:00", "section": "2016 Presidential Race", "modified_time": "2015-05-28T09:29:10-07:00", "tag": "TPP", "categories": "Breitbart TV,2016 Presidential Race,Hillary Clinton"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce0fc\"", "article_summary": "SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERAFL-CIO President Richard Trumka said that it was \u201cconceivable\u201d the AFL-CIO might not endorse Hillary Clinton and warned her of the consequences of taking the wrong position on trade in an interview with USA Today\u2019s \u201cCapital Download\u201d released on Thursday.\nIt\u2019ll make it far more difficult.\u201dInterviewer Susan Page followed-up that since the AFL-CIO won\u2019t endorse a Republican candidate, what the cost would really be if he wasn\u2019t happy with Hillary.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERTrumka said (relevant remarks being around 4:00) that he didn\u2019t know where Hillary stands on TPA and TPP \u201cI think she\u2019s going to have to answer that.\nHe stated, \u201cWell, there\u2019s another alternative as well, you can not endorse for president,\u201d which he said was \u201cconceivable\u201d if \u201cIf both candidates didn\u2019t \u2014 weren\u2019t interested in raising wages and creating jobs.\nTrumka was then asked what the political ramifications would be if Hillary took a position \u201csimilar to the one she\u2019s taken in the past when it comes to these big trade deals.\u201d He answered, \u201cIt will be tougher to mobilize working people."}
