The ruling party\u2019s use of restrictive laws, political cronyism and brute force is so effective at eliminating its political opponents that the party and its allies won 546 out of 547 seats in parliament in the 2010 elections.\n\nYet, despite this complete disregard for even a semblance of democratic governance, Ethiopia \u2014 along with 10 other authoritarian African regimes \u2014 enjoys the ability to export nearly 6,500 products to the U.S. duty-free as a participant in the Africa Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA).\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThis is not what AGOA\u2019s supporters envisioned when Congress passed the law in 2000.\n\nBack then, the concept was simple: Promote sustainable export-led growth to help African countries like Ethiopia move away from relying solely on extractive resources and subsistence farming to improve livelihoods. To achieve that goal, the U.S. eliminated trade barriers on certain products for African nations that made efforts to improve their legal systems and human rights protections. This is a good approach, and we support it.\n\nBut, today, AGOA is falling short of its goals because Africa\u2019s most repressive governments benefit from it. Congress should fix AGOA\u2019s weaknesses when it reauthorizes the trade deal this year.\n\nThe main problem Congress should tackle is AGOA\u2019s eligibility rules. They are vague and ineffective, and there is little scrutiny of whether countries are meeting those objectives. The president is authorized to make a country eligible for AGOA so long as that country is \u201cmaking continual progress toward\u201d having a market-based economy, eliminating trade barriers and establishing the rule of law.\n\nThe problem is that almost any country that has not had a coup or perpetrated massive human rights abuses can qualify. In fact, of the 39 countries eligible under AGOA, 11 are considered \u201cnot free,\u201d according to rankings by Freedom House\u2019s Freedom in the World 2015 report. Without more precise terminology and careful scrutiny, Africa\u2019s dictators will continue to benefit from access to U.S. markets without actually making political and economic reforms.\n\nA lack of transparency also hampers AGOA\u2019s potential. It is unclear how the U.S. government determines a country\u2019s eligibility. For example, Ethiopia and Gambia both have eliminated political pluralism, but Ethiopia is eligible for AGOA benefits while Gambia is not.\n\nIf Congress wants AGOA to promote development and incentivize reform, it needs to tighten and clarify eligibility requirements and improve transparency. African governments should receive trade benefits only if they take concrete steps to improve governance and accountability and protect human rights. For example, rather than just stating that countries must have established or be making progress toward \u201cpolitical pluralism,\u201d as is the case under current law, AGOA should include specific markers such as fair elections, space for political opposition and dissent and so on.\n\nCongress should strengthen the review process to ensure accurate assessment and enforcement of each country\u2019s eligibility. The U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) should be required to consult with African and U.S. civil society groups to assess whether countries are truly making progress toward democracy and protecting human rights. And, when determining eligibility based on economic indicators, the USTR should seek the expertise of African and American businesses. Feedback from knowledgeable sources will provide the on-the-ground information needed to assess each country\u2019s eligibility accurately.\n\nFinally, Congress should require that the review process and its findings be public. This will provide much-needed clarity for Africans trying to hold their governments accountable and make AGOA work in their countries. It will also allow for more effective engagement by nongovernmental groups, improving the quality of feedback these groups can provide.\n\nThe simple fact is that dictators are bad for development. Long-term economic growth is not sustainable in environments plagued by corruption, abuse, and repression. Knowledge-based economies depend on democratic, accountable governance. Strong rule of law, independent media, innovation-spurring free expression, and responsive government policies are not just conditions for a functioning democracy, they are the conditions entrepreneurs and investors need to start and grow their businesses.\n\nAGOA was meant to be much more than just a trade preference program. It still has that potential. It could become an effective way to promote the type of governments and legal systems necessary for deepening democratic cultures and flourishing marketplaces.\n\nIt would be tragic if Congress misses this opportunity.\n\nLagon is the president of Freedom House.
