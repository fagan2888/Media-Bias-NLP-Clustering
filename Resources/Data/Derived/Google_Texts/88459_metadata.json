Still, manager Walt Weiss admitted the Rockies have to improve.\n\nRockies Mailbag: Pose a question for Patrick Saunders\n\n\u201cWe have to get better with two strikes; that\u2019s too many strikeouts,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Dodgers strike out hitters a lot; that\u2019s a big part of what they do on the mound. But still, we have to compete better.\u201d\n\nSymbolic of the Rockies\u2019 vexation was the sight of outfielder Charlie Blackmon getting tossed Sunday for the first time in his big-league career. He was ejected in the fifth inning for arguing balls and strikes with plate umpire Marty Foster, who many of the Rockies thought had a wildly inconsistent strike zone.\n\n\u201cI got frustrated,\u201d Blackmon said. \u201cI\u2019m not blaming anything on anybody. The thing was, I shouldn\u2019t have got thrown out right there and put my team in that position.\u201d\n\nWith two out and two on, and with a chance to tie the score, Blackmon struck out for the third time. Blackmon\u2019s ejection left the Rockies \u2014 already short on the bench because of injuries to Corey Dickerson and Troy Tulowitzki \u2014 without a true outfielder to take Blackmon\u2019s place. So Weiss had to call on Rafael Ynoa to move from second base to left field and bring in DJ LeMahieu to play second.\n\n\u201cI forced DJ to come into the game cold,\u201d Blackmon said. \u201cIt was a mistake on my part. I just blew up and overreacted. That\u2019s my fault.\u201d\n\nA win Sunday would have given the Rockies an unexpected knockout of the National League West-leading Dodgers. Instead, the Rockies had to settle for a split decision in the four-game series.\n\nKendrick took the loss for Colorado, falling to 1-5, but he deserved a better fate. The Rockies, shackled for six innings by Dodgers starter Mike Bolsinger and confounded by Foster\u2019s strike zone, were shut out for the second time this season. The other time was April 19 at Dodger Stadium.\n\n\u201cI thought we had pitches to hit today, but we didn\u2019t take advantage,\u201d said third baseman Nolan Arenado, who went 0-for-3 and saw a potential two-run homer drift foul down the left-field line in the sixth inning. \u201cAs a team we just couldn\u2019t get anybody on, but give credit to (Bol- singer). He pitched a good game.\u201d\n\nThe Dodgers scratched out the game\u2019s only run with two outs in the fourth. Adrian Gonzalez singled to right and Kendrick walked Justin Turner before Yasmani Grandal scooted an RBI single just out of reach of Ynoa at second base.\n\nKendrick pitched well for the second consecutive game, but again he failed to put another W on his r\u00e9sum\u00e9. He went seven innings, allowing one run on three hits. He walked five and struck out one.\n\nKendrick faced a cliffhanger in the sixth but emerged unscathed. He walked the bases full, bringing Dodgers fans to their feet, but Andre Ethier lined out to Drew Stubbs in center field.\n\nPatrick Saunders: psaunders@denverpost.com or twitter.com/psaundersdp\n\nSwings and misses\n\nThe Rockies struck out at a record rate while on their six-game West Coast road trip, which wrapped up Sunday:\n\nThey whiffed 18 times Friday in a 6-4 loss to the Dodgers, the most strikeouts in a nine-inning game in Rockies history.\n\nThey struck out 54 times in the four-game series at Dodger Stadium and 76 times overall on the road trip.\n\nAccording to Elias Sports, the Rockies are the first team in baseball\u2019s modern era (since 1900) to strike out 14 or more times in three consecutive games \u2014 14 vs. the Angels on Wednesday, 14 vs. the Dodgers on Thursday, 18 vs. the Dodgers on Friday.\n\nPatrick Saunders, The Denver Post", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Rockies get blanked by Dodgers, split four-game series", "title": "Rockies get blanked by Dodgers, split four-game series", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/05/17/rockies-get-blanked-by-dodgers-split-four-game-series/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150517__rockies2p1.jpg", "height": 439}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150517__rockies2p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-05-17T17:00:43+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-23T05:51:28+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\u201cThe Dodgers strike out hitters a lot; that\u2019s a big part of what they do on the mound.\nThey struck out 54 times in the four-game series at Dodger Stadium and 76 times overall on the road trip.\nInstead, the Rockies had to settle for a split decision in the four-game series.\nThat\u2019s my fault.\u201dA win Sunday would have given the Rockies an unexpected knockout of the National League West-leading Dodgers.\nRockies Mailbag: Pose a question for Patrick Saunders\u201cWe have to get better with two strikes; that\u2019s too many strikeouts,\u201d he said."}
