They will pay a little more, but on a historically adjusted basis it\u2019s still relatively inexpensive.\u201d\n\nAnd since there are a few differences in availability between local and national sources of capital, CFOs may be able to pick and choose where they can get the best rates.\n\n\u201cI toss and turn nightly as I will soon have to borrow some money.\u201d Tweet\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen that local investors have been very aggressive in their interest rates offers,\u201d said Buchanan. \u201cDespite the challenges associated with healthcare and insurance reform, it is still a viable business. That allows both local and national lenders to understand the situation and provide aggressive or low-interest rates to borrowers.\u201d\n\nBarring an unforeseen catastrophe, interest rates should stay low, possibly until after the 2016 elections. But rates will still cause some concern for the hospital CFO.\n\n\u201cI toss and turn nightly as I will soon have to borrow some money,\u201d said Mark Bogen, senior vice president and CFO at South Nassau Communities Hospital in Oceanside, New York. \u201cDo I raise capital through a taxable venue because I don\u2019t have certificate-of-need projects ready to take the tax exempt route? If I wait until my CON projects are in place, will I lose the opportunity for savings since there is currently an 80 basis point difference between taxable and tax-exempt rates?\u201d\n\nA recent change is that lenders are ready to finance higher levels of \u201csoft capital\u201d. This means that hospitals have a greater ability to raise capital for things like software or the costs of implementing systems. These are needs that are not backed by collateral and only by the creditworthiness of the institution.\n\n[ALSO: Fitch bullish on for-profit healthcare]\n\n\u201cWith the advent of electronic medical records, you are finding people who are willing to finance some of the critical clinical and information technology infrastructure,\u201d said Bogen. \u201cBefore this change it was very difficult to get soft capital financing for more than a small part of a much larger borrowing. Now about 20 percent of annual capital budgets are tied to soft capital expenditures.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/hospitals-find-plenty-options-credit-2015", "image": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/South-Nassau-Communities-Hospital-feature.gif", "site_name": "Healthcare Finance News", "description": "While many hospitals are wondering what their access to credit will be in the New Year, experts say little will likely change compared to 2014.", "title": "Hospitals find plenty of options for credit in 2015"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/South-Nassau-Communities-Hospital-feature.gif"}, "description": "While many hospitals are wondering what their access to credit will be in the New Year, experts say little will likely change compared to 2014.", "site": "@HC_Finance", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Hospitals find plenty of options for credit in 2015"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "While many hospitals are wondering what their access to credit will be in the New Year, experts say little will likely change compared to 2014.", "viewport": "width=device-width; initial-scale=1.0; maximum-scale=1.0; user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd461\"", "article_summary": "Now about 20 percent of annual capital budgets are tied to soft capital expenditures.\u201d\n\u201cBefore this change it was very difficult to get soft capital financing for more than a small part of a much larger borrowing.\nPhoto from GoogleWhile many hospitals are wondering what their access to credit will be in the New Year, experts say little will likely change compared to 2014.\nThis means that hospitals have a greater ability to raise capital for things like software or the costs of implementing systems.\n\u201cMost healthcare borrowers will have access to the capital markets, even the ones that have experienced challenges."}
