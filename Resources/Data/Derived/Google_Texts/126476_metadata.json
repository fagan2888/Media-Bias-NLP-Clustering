Just 20 percent say they would characterize government programs as being well-run. Lawmakers, governors and other elected officials are so widely reviled that 55 percent of those surveyed insisted that \u201cordinary Americans\u201d would do a better job of solving national problems.\n\nMoreover, Trump and former neurosurgeon Ben Carson, neither of whom has ever been in government, are the top choices for president among Republican voters who are angriest about government.\n\nThe survey, based on 6,000 interviews conducted between Aug. 27 and Oct. 4, found that 64 percent of those Republicans \u201cangry\u201d at government have a favorable view of Trump, while 71 percent have strong favorable views of Carson.\n\nBy contrast, only 36 percent of those angry GOP voters are favorably disposed to former Florida governor Jeb Bush, who is widely viewed as part of the political establishment. While other presidential candidates seen as political insiders are suffering from voter backlash, two exceptions are Republican senators Marco Rubio of Florida, who received a positive rating from 66 percent of angry Republicans, and Ted Cruz of Texas, with 58 percent.\n\nRelated: Trump Vows to Bring Back Waterboarding in Fight Against ISIS\n\nA new Washington Post-ABC News national poll released over the weekend shows Trump leading the field with 32 percent of likely Republican primary voters, followed by Carson with 22 percent and Rubio with 11 percent.\n\nAmericans concede that running the government is a tough job and that more than half the big issues facing the country do not have clear solutions, according to the survey.\n\nBut by a margin of 55 percent to 39 percent, Americans believe that ordinary Americans could do a better job of solving the country\u2019s most intractable problems than elected officials.\n\nThis has been one of Trump\u2019s major campaign themes, as he repeatedly has dismissed President Obama and other government officials as \u201cincompetent\u201d or \u201cvery, very stupid people.\u201d\n\nRelated: Trump Still Leads the GOP Pack While Carson Falters\n\nThe Pew study cautions that the percentage of Republicans who say they are angry with their government (32 percent) is not quite as high as in October 2013, when it was 38 percent. However, Republicans are nearly three times as likely as Democrats to say they are angry with the government. And among politically active Republicans and Democrats who vote and follow politics closely, the gap is nearly four to one \u2013 or 42 percent to 11 percent.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "A comprehensive new survey documenting Americans\u2019 jaded views of their government grap", "title": "Trump Thrives as Trust in Government Hits 50-Year Low", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/11/23/Trump-Thrives-Trust-Government-Hits-50-Year-Low", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/09252013_Ominous_Capitol.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/11/23/Trump-Thrives-Trust-Government-Hits-50-Year-Low", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/09252013_Ominous_Capitol.jpg", "creator": "@ericpianin", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "A comprehensive new survey documenting Americans\u2019 jaded views of their government grap", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Moreover, Trump and former neurosurgeon Ben Carson, neither of whom has ever been in government, are the top choices for president among Republican voters who are angriest about government.\nHowever, Republicans are nearly three times as likely as Democrats to say they are angry with the government.\nRelated: Trump Turns to Race-Baiting and 9/11 FantasiesCurrently, a mere 19 percent say they can trust the government always or most of the time, among the lowest levels in the past 50 years.\nThe survey, based on 6,000 interviews conducted between Aug. 27 and Oct. 4, found that 64 percent of those Republicans \u201cangry\u201d at government have a favorable view of Trump, while 71 percent have strong favorable views of Carson.\nAnd among politically active Republicans and Democrats who vote and follow politics closely, the gap is nearly four to one \u2013 or 42 percent to 11 percent."}
