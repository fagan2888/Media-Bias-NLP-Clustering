The Bible-teaching ministry of Pastor Chuck Swindoll filed suit on Wednesday over the federal governmentâ€™s mandate requiring Christian ministries to provide health coverage to employees for abortion-inducing drugs and devices.

Swindoll is the founder and senior pastor-teacher of Stonebriar Community Church in Frisco and chancellor of Dallas Theological Seminary. His Insight for Living Ministries is operating from Plano while it builds a new headquarters at Lebanon Road and Parkwood Boulevard in Frisco.

The suit filed in the Eastern District of Texas is against the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the U.S. Department of Labor, the U.S. Department of the Treasury, and the secretaries of each of those departments. Insight for Living Ministries is being represented by the nonprofit Liberty Institute. The case has been assigned to U.S. District Judge Richard Schell in Plano.

According to the suit, the ministry strongly believes in the sanctity of human life and the evils of abortion. But under the federal Affordable Care Act, the ministry states it must either to drop its health insurance and accept a religious accommodation in violation of its strongly held religious beliefs or pay crippling fines. Exemptions approved for many churches and businesses do not apply to the ministry, according to the suit.
