Not only do doctors see kids doubled over with stomach pain after downing several bags of the snacks, but they also see lot of worried parents who believe their child\u2019s stool has blood in it, due to the dark orange and red coloring of the snacks.\n\n\u201cWe have a population who loves to eat the hot, spicy, not-real foods, and they come in [to the emergency room] with these real complaints,\u201d Dr. Martha Rivera of White Memorial Medical Center in Los Angeles told KABC-TV. \u201c[The kids are being] set up for ulcerations, erosions and\u2026 peptic ulcer disease.\u201d\n\nAndrew Medina, 12, eats bags of spicy snacks \u2014 up to 20 or 30 per month. After experiencing stomach pain, he went to see the doctor, who told him the spicy chips were causing gastritis, or inflammation of the stomach lining. Gastritis is associated with bloating, burning, and vomiting. \u201cLike if you have a bruise or something,\u201d Medina explained, according to KABC-TV. \u201cIt really hurts a lot.\u201d\n\n\u201cA number of patients who have consumed these Cheetos in excess have complained of pain in their upper abdomen, rising up into their chest, likely due to the red peppers and spice contained in the snack,\u201d Dr. Robert Glatter, an emergency medicine physician at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York, told CBS News.\n\nThere are already some school districts in New Mexico, California and Illinois that have banned the snacks due to their lack of nutritional value, hoping to encourage children to eat healthier foods like string cheese, apples, or pretzels instead of spicy chips and Cheetos. About 21 pieces of Flamin\u2019 Hot Cheetos contains 160 calories, 250 milligrams of sodium, 11 grams of fat, and 1.5 grams of saturated fat, according to Frito-Lay, the manufacturer of Cheetos.\n\nSome scientists and doctors cite the addictive qualities of food products like Cheetos as one reason why children may overeat them. \u201cIt\u2019s something that has been engineered so that it is fattier and saltier and more novel to the point where our body, brain, and pleasure centers react to it more strongly than if we were eating, say, a handful of nuts,\u201d Ashley Gearhardt, a clinical psychology professor at the University of Michigan, told the Chicago Tribune. \u201cGoing along with that, we are seeing those classic signs of addiction, the cravings and loss of control and preoccupation with it.\u201d Because Flamin\u2019 Hot Cheetos have become so popular among young people, other snack companies have created spicy products to compete: Hot \u2018N Spicy Crunchy Nuggetz, Sizzlin\u2019 Cheese Flavored Twists, and Sizzlin\u2019 Hot Crunchy Kurls, for example.\n\nChildren should avoid eating Flamin\u2019 Hot Cheetos and other processed snacks in large quantities in order to avoid gastritis and other health risks. \u201cIt burns when it goes down, it burns when it comes out,\u201d Dr. Rivera told KABC-TV.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "spicy snacks, cheetos, flaming hot cheetos, gastritis, burning stomach, er", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Don\u2019t down entire bags of Cheetos and other spicy snacks since they may inflame your stomach lining, doctors say.", "title": "Spicy Chips, Cheetos Inflame Your Mouth...
