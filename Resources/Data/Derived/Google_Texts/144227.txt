Kentuckians for Growth, Opportunity and Prosperity has rolled out a new television ad boosting Republican gubernatorial candidate James Comer’s profile against a familiar Democratic foe less than three weeks before GOP voters hit the polls.

President Barack Obama has a co-starring role in the 30-second KGOP spot, which is airing in the Louisville, Lexington, Bowling Green and Hazard broadcast markets per Federal Communications Commission filings.

An official with KGOP — a super political action committee backing Comer’s gubernatorial bid that has raised $754,500 and spent more than $620,000, according to its 32-day pre-primary report to the Kentucky Registry of Election Finance — did not return a call seeking comment Wednesday.

The ad starts with images of the president, who is particularly unpopular in Kentucky, in mock newspaper front pages while a narrator talks about the Affordable Care Act, economy and “war on coal.”

“Obama’s term is almost over, but his job-killing policies aren’t,” a female narrator says in the ad. “We need a proven, effective leader as governor: James Comer.”

The ad, which also notes the Kentucky Department of Agriculture’s legal battle to have seized hemp seeds released from federal custody, can be viewed here:

This marks the second KGOP television ad of the primary election cycle and comes days after a 501(c )(4) group supporting former Louisville Metro Councilman Hal Heiner, Citizens for a Sound Government, began airing its second TV spot assailing Comer’s vote to boost legislative pensions in 2005.

Heiner and Comer, Kentucky’s agriculture commissioner, are seeking the Republican gubernatorial nomination in a field that includes Louisville investment manager Matt Bevin and former Kentucky Supreme Court Justice Will T. Scott.
