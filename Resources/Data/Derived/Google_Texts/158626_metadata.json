I didn\u2019t get tired. I always had plenty of intensity, concentration, a high performance level from the first match in Beijing to today\u2019s match.\u201d\n\nTsonga came into the match leading the tournament with 64 aces, but Djokovic returned so effectively that he broke the Frenchman three times and held him to zero aces in the opening set.\n\nTsonga played more aggressively in the second set, but still had to fight off five break points until Djokovic was finally able to convert on his sixth when the Frenchman double-faulted while serving at 4-all. Djokovic then served out the match.\n\n\u201cToday, there is nothing to say. He\u2019s playing a lot better than everybody,\u201d Tsonga said. \u201cYou have to be in your best shape to beat him anyway, and everybody knows that it\u2019s not easy to play your best tennis every match.\u201d\n\nDjokovic has traditionally played well during the Asian swing following the U.S. Open when other players are either nursing injuries or tired after a long season. In terms of the quality of his tennis in China this year, though, the Serb said he\u2019s never felt as confident.\n\n\u201cI mean, only one set where I got a tiebreak in two weeks is quite incredible,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I\u2019m very, very pleased with the way I\u2019ve played.\u201d\n\nHaving a lot of fan support certainly helps. His Chinese supporters packed the stadium on Sunday with Serbia flags, and as Djokovic noted earlier this week some have even given themselves Serbian names and are learning his country\u2019s national anthem.\n\nDjokovic thanked them for their support by writing a different Chinese character on the courtside television camera after each match (\u201clove\u201d and \u201cfortune\u201d are two of his favorites) and trying some Mandarin in his victory speech.\n\n\u201cI need to work on my phrases more because I\u2019ve been saying the same thing for too many years,\u201d he said with a laugh.\n\nBut it\u2019s not just China where he has been winning this year - it\u2019s just about everywhere.\n\nAmong his accomplishments, with the Paris Masters and ATP Finals in London still left to play:\n\n- Djokovic became one of three men to play in all four Grand Slam finals in a single season in the Open era, joining Roger Federer and Rod Laver. (Laver, coincidentally, was in the stands to watch Djokovic\u2019s win on Sunday.)\n\n- With wins in Beijing and Shanghai, he surpassed $16 million in prize money, the highest ever by a player in a single season.\n\n- He has also reached 13 consecutive finals dating back to January, second only to Federer\u2019s 17 straight finals in 2005-06.\n\nAnd there\u2019s every reason Djokovic could finish the season undefeated - he hasn\u2019t lost in Paris or London since 2012.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not thinking about being unbeaten \u2018till the rest of the year,\u201d he said. \u201cBut, yes, that\u2019s an option. It\u2019s a possibility.\u201d\n\nAs good as this year has been, he has more goals to achieve next year, chiefly among them capturing his first French Open and Olympic gold in Rio de Janeiro. He just hopes he\u2019ll continue to have the motivation and stamina to keep it up.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to get carried away by success,\u201d Djokovic said, \u201cbecause I want to be playing on this level for many more years to come.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Novak Djokovic wore a red shirt in his matches at the Shanghai Masters this week to connect with his Chinese fans and perhaps give himself a little boost.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Novak Djokovic wore a red shirt in his matches at the Shanghai Masters this week to connect with his Chinese fans and perhaps give himself a little boost.", "title": "Djokovic caps successful China swing with Shanghai title", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/oct/18/djokovic-wins-9th-title-of-year-at-shanghai-master/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/10/18/5d1d8d06d73e2b2e850f6a706700f4ec.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/10/18/5d1d8d06d73e2b2e850f6a706700f4ec.jpg", "description": "Novak Djokovic wore a red shirt in his matches at the Shanghai Masters this week to connect with his Chinese fans and perhaps give himself a little boost.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Djokovic caps successful China swing with Shanghai title"}, "Author": "JUSTIN BERGMAN", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2ac9\"", "article_summary": "SHANGHAI (AP) - Novak Djokovic wore a red shirt in his matches at the Shanghai Masters this week to connect with his Chinese fans and perhaps give himself a little boost.\nAnd there\u2019s every reason Djokovic could finish the season undefeated - he hasn\u2019t lost in Paris or London since 2012.\nDjokovic defeated Jo-Wilfried Tsonga of France 6-2, 6-4 to capture the ninth title of his impressive season in Shanghai on Sunday, a week after he triumphed at the China Open in Beijing for the sixth time in six appearances.\nIn terms of the quality of his tennis in China this year, though, the Serb said he\u2019s never felt as confident.\n- With wins in Beijing and Shanghai, he surpassed $16 million in prize money, the highest ever by a player in a single season."}
