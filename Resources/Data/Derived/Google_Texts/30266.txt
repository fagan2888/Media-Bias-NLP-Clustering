Traveling retail center will help both current and prospective BlueCross customers learn about changes in health insurance under the Affordable Care Act.

BlueCross BlueShield of South Carolina today introduced the South Carolina BLUESM mobile unit, designed to bring health insurance choices to people across the state.The BlueCross wrapped 40-foot RV will show up at events and locations all over South Carolina. It’s a traveling retail center where both current and prospective BlueCross customers can learn about changes in health insurance under the Affordable Care Act.Unique in South Carolina, the SC BLUE mobile unit is one of many efforts by BlueCross to provide health insurance information in a comfortable environment. Consumers can get face-to-face service, shop for insurance or make payments on an existing policy.“The process of purchasing health insurance is changing. With the individual insurance mandate of the Affordable Care Act fast approaching, consumers are navigating a shopping experience that is new to a lot of them. Our retail strategy, including launching SC BLUE mobile and opening stores, is an innovative approach intended to make this process less confusing,” said Terry Peace, senior vice president of small group and individual insurance.
