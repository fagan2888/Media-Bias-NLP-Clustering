FORT WAYNE, Ind. (AP) - A northeastern Indiana lawmaker who was defeated in May’s Republican primary amid a backlash over her vote that helped keep a gay marriage ban off Indiana’s November ballot has resigned from her seat to join a medical industry trade group.

State Rep. Kathy Heuer, R-Columbia City, announced her resignation Friday to become executive director of the Indiana Medical Device Manufacturing Council, which lobbies state and federal lawmakers and regulators on behalf of medical device companies.

Heuer had served as District 83 representative since 2010, representing parts of Allen and Whitley counties. She lost her re-election bid in the Republican primary in May to Christopher Judy, a Fort Wayne union autoworker who received help from tea party groups. His name will appear on the November ballot.

Heuer had faced a backlash over her vote that helped keep a gay marriage ban off Indiana’s November ballot, as well as her votes to support the Common Core education standards that Indiana pulled out of earlier this year.

Heuer said Friday she doesn’t want to play the what-if game in regard to her votes and primary loss. She said that loss gave her the opportunity to actively seek a new position, The Journal Gazette reported (http://bit.ly/1AHDT2L ).

“I’ve met some wonderful people and had some wonderful learning opportunities,” Heuer said of her time as a lawmaker.

Heuer said now that she’s joining the medical device lobbying group, she will abide by a state law that requires former lawmakers to refrain from any lobbying for 365 days.

“It’s the right thing to do,” she told the newspaper.

Heuer believes her background in business, education, sales and government policy helped her land her new post. She said education and business often work together to prepare the workforce needed for economic growth and sustain high-paying manufacturing jobs.
