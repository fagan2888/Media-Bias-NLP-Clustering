(NYSE: AET), Humana Inc. (NYSE: HUM), WellPoint Inc. (NYSE: WLP), Cigna Corp. (NYSE: CI), and UnitedHealth Group Inc. (NYSE: UNH) \u2013 is up more than 11% year to date.\n\nAll five are trading just under their all-time highs.\n\nSo far this year, the sector is up over 10%, while the Standard & Poor's 500 index is up just 7.5%. Last year, as investors were anticipating the official launch of Obamacare in October, the healthcare sector rose 39%, second only to consumer discretionaries.\n\nAnd according to Thomson Reuters, the profit estimates for healthcare stocks this year have increased to 12.2% from 8.3% as of Jan 1, while the forecasts for most other sectors have declined.\n\n\n\nAll this is before the ACA is even fully implemented.\n\nIn fact, if you take a step back, you can see that the health insurance stocks have been steadily rising since the ACA was signed into law in March of 2010. The iShares Health Care ETF, for example, is up nearly 97% in that span, well above the 70% gain for the S&P 500.\n\nSo, yes, the health insurance industry is definitely in the pink right now. But how can investors be sure Obamacare will keep healthcare stocks flourishing?\n\nWell, because the health insurance industry planned it that way\u2026\n\nHow Obamacare Will Feed the Profits of Healthcare Stocks\n\nAs the ACA continues to unfold \u2013 it won't fully come into effect until 2020 \u2013 it's becoming increasingly evident that the health insurance company lobbyists did a great job of ensuring the law would pump up their profits\u2026", "article_metadata": {"description": "Healthcare stocks, especially the health insurers, stand to profit for years from Obamacare.
