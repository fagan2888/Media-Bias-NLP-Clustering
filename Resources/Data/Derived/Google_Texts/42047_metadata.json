Some avalanches may be very large and destructive.\n\n\u201cBackcountry travelers are advised to stay well clear of all avalanche terrain. Avoid traveling on or under steep slopes.\u201d\n\nSnow in the mountains should decrease starting Monday afternoon and come to an end Monday night, although many areas could get an additional 1 to 4 inches Monday, forecasters said Sunday.\n\nSnow and gusty winds could return to the mountains Wednesday and continue through the end of the week.\n\nClouds and fog, similar to Sunday\u2019s weather, should continue in the Denver region Monday, with a high temperature of just 31 degrees, forecasters said.\n\nSunny skies return Tuesday with a high of 47, according to the forecast.
