But instead, the empire of Austen has only expanded since then, absorbing genres like chick lit, paranormal romance and zombies into its fold \u2014 with titles like \u201cMe and Mr. Darcy,\u201d \u201cPride and Prejudice and Zombies\u201d and \u201cMr. Darcy, Vampyre.\u201d Austen has proven to be the Shakespeare of the intimate, with most of her six novels serving as reliable blueprints for romantic comedies with heart, easily transferable to Boca Raton, Mars or Bollywood. And it doesn\u2019t hurt that she sells copies. As a result of all this, Austen straddles the role of literary foremother, fan-fiction inspiration and commercial brand.\n\nRecently the Austen juggernaut has returned to its roots with novels and Web series that take a deeper, more sophisticated literary approach. Maybe this more mature phase of Austenmania is due to the success of P.D James\u2019 highbrow 2012 sequel to \u201cPride and Prejudice,\u201d \u201cDeath Comes to Pemberley.\u201d Or perhaps it\u2019s a backlash against the plague of Regency zombies and ghouls. But the loftier ambitions of these new Austen projects raise the question: What, beyond gimmickry, makes a work that is essentially fan fiction an artistic success? What will give readers value beyond amusing twists like Elizabeth Bennet vlogging, Marianne Dashwood hopping into Mr. Willougby\u2019s sports car, or a servant emptying Mr. Collins\u2019 chamber pot?\n\nThe latter moment occurs in \u201cLongbourn,\u201d a new historical novel by Jo Baker, which tells the story of \u201cPride and Prejudice\u201d from the perspective of the Bennet family servants, reminding us that the spunky obliviousness to dirt shown by Lizzy Bennet makes extra laundry for the folks downstairs. Think Occupy Austen. The same month that \u201cLongbourn\u201d appeared, \u201cSense & Sensibility\u201d (yes, that\u2019s the title) by Joanna Trollope hit shelves as the first installment of \u201cThe Austen Project\u201d \u2014 a series of rewrites by novelists including Curtis Sittenfield and Alexander McCall Smith. Trollope\u2019s \u201cSense\u201d is incredibly faithful, keeping character names intact and staying on location, but with modern technology: Estates remain estates (although one is now an estate for recovering addicts), London stands in for London, and ditto for romantic encounters in the British countryside. Along with these new novels, there\u2019s a new breed of Austen adaptations for the youth: \u201cThe Lizzie Bennet Diaries\u201d and \u201cEmma, Approved\u201d are Web series that depict Austen\u2019s heroines as Internet oversharers, divulging stories through YouTube videos with real-time tweets helping out. These virtual retellings may be hip, but in some ways they are the most respectful homage of all, thanks to their clever narrative devices, emotional highs and lows, and winks at fans of Austen\u2019s work \u2014 \u201cKitty Bennet\u201d shows up as a cat, for instance, and in the midst of the modern dialogue a choice Austen line is very liable to sneak in. It turns out you don\u2019t need to be a book, a miniseries or a movie to do Jane Austen right. You can also be a fictional vlog.\n\nAs a Janeite, I encounter each of these new remixes anxiously. Retellings are tricky. If done well \u2014 think \u201cWide Sargasso Sea\u201d or \u201cRosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead\u201d \u2014 we\u2019ll enjoy the new work of art while reengaging thoughtfully with the source it\u2019s based on. But if the project goes south, it risks being a crappy experience and clouding our perception of the original. After my husband and I read \u201cDeath Comes to Pemberley\u201d last winter we were so irritated by its bland, insipid take on Austen\u2019s characters that we had to binge-watch all five hours of the 1995 BBC \u201cPride and Prejudice,\u201d just to get \u201cthe real\u201d Lizzy and Darcy back in our consciousness. (I had to the perform a similar cleansing after skimming \u201cPride and Prejudice and Zombies,\u201d and encountering its can\u2019t-be-unseen images of Regency undead.)\n\nBut sometimes a new perspective on a classic can be healthy. Alas, Lizzy, I thought after reading scenes in \u201cLongbourn\u201d during which Lizzy thoughtlessly makes her housemaid Sarah\u2019s backbreaking work harder. The novel\u2019s counter-narrative shows that the precarious position of the unmarried women in Austen\u2019s novels trickled down to those who served them. The threat looms: If the Bennet daughters don\u2019t marry well, the household staff could lose its livelihood, its home. And each marker of status in Austen\u2019s world, from white dresses to \u201cfamily dinners,\u201d taxes the servants\u2019 labor \u2014 the extra burden below stairs signifies the family\u2019s gentility. Unlike \u201cPride and Prejudice and Zombies\u201d or other mashups, \u201cLongbourn\u2019s\u201d disruption of Austen\u2019s text has a singular literary purpose, adding a new layer of class awareness that complements Austen\u2019s own economic commentary.\n\nOften, though, Baker\u2019s effort at \u201crewriting\u201d the characters to show their privilege feels didactic \u2014 we get it, they\u2019re enabling the gears of oppression. And the novel\u2019s references to outhouses and other effluvia come relentlessly, almost as though Baker is purposely trying to shock decorous Austen fans with a taste of historical reality. This poking is all very well, but I would have preferred to see \u201dLongbourn\u201d respond even more to Austen thematically, zooming in and lingering on the parallels between the servants\u2019 lives and those of Austen\u2019s characters: their mistaken pride and false impressions among the dirty dishes. When Baker does this effectively, as when the male servant, James, takes over the diaper-washing from Sarah and she relishes a moment of relief, it\u2019s sublime \u2014 and it echoes the favor Darcy does for Lizzy toward the end of \u201cPride and Prejudice.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Austen adaptations are everywhere, from \"Longbourn\" to \"Mr. Darcy, Vampyre.\" A Web series shows how to do it right", "title": "How to make a Jane Austen reboot that\u2019s actually good", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Austen adaptations are everywhere, from \"Longbourn\" to \"Mr. Darcy, Vampyre.\" A Web series shows how to do it right", "title": "How to make a Jane Austen reboot that\u2019s actually good", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2013/11/11/how_to_make_a_jane_austen_reboot_thats_actually_good/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/11/lizzie_bennet.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Austen adaptations are everywhere, from \"Longbourn\" to \"Mr. Darcy, Vampyre.\" A Web series shows how to do it right", "title": "How to make a Jane Austen reboot that\u2019s actually good", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/11/lizzie_bennet.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Sarah Seltzer", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, death comes to pemberley, Jane Austen, lizzy bennet diaries, longbourn", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde8a0\"", "article_summary": "The novel\u2019s counter-narrative shows that the precarious position of the unmarried women in Austen\u2019s novels trickled down to those who served them.\nIt turns out you don\u2019t need to be a book, a miniseries or a movie to do Jane Austen right.\nRecently the Austen juggernaut has returned to its roots with novels and Web series that take a deeper, more sophisticated literary approach.\nAs a result of all this, Austen straddles the role of literary foremother, fan-fiction inspiration and commercial brand.\nAlas, Lizzy, I thought after reading scenes in \u201cLongbourn\u201d during which Lizzy thoughtlessly makes her housemaid Sarah\u2019s backbreaking work harder."}
