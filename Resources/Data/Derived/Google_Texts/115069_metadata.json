They were not willing to talk about taxing the wealthy. They were not willing to talk about Obamacare even \u2014 they tried to disassociate themselves from their own President and their own party,\u201d he said. \u201cA lot of us believed that had to change. I believe an amazing thing has happened in this last year.\u201d\n\nDe Blasio said he and his progressive brethren had much more in store to fight for \u2014 federal policies to tax the rich and raise wages and benefits \u2014 though he did not specify what those events would be.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to change the debate, change political reality so we can get real changes in Washington that will benefit 8.5 million people here. And I\u2019m going to keep doing that. The forum was one of many ideas,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cFasten your seatbelts. Get ready for the long haul,\u201d the mayor added.\n\n\u201cA lot of us \u2014 and I mean my fellow mayors, I mean members of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, I mean labor union leaders, faith leaders \u2014 we\u2019re going to be working in every corner of this country to change this nation and to address income inequality. We are in this for the long haul,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "ERIN DURKIN", "twitter": {"description": "Mayor de Blasio admitted his Iowa presidential forum collapsed because no one wanted to go.", "title": "De Blasio not deterred by Iowa forum failure", "url": "http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/de-blasio-not-deterred-iowa-forum-failure-article-1.2431765", "image": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2431764.1447285177!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/496503930.jpg", "site": "@nydailynews", "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.tags": "bill de blasio", "parsely-author": "Erin Durkin", "parsely-type": "article", "keywords": "bill de blasio", "news_keywords": "bill de blasio", "parsely-link": "http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/de-blasio-not-deterred-iowa-forum-failure-article-1.2431765", "parsely-title": "De Blasio not deterred by Iowa forum failure", "sailthru.date": "2015-11-11T18:41:48-0500", "sailthru.title": "De Blasio not deterred by Iowa forum failure", "nydn_section": "Politics", "parsely-pub-date": "2015-11-11T23:41:48", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2431764.1447285177!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/496503930.jpg", "description": "Mayor de Blasio admitted his Iowa presidential forum collapsed because no one wanted to go.", "robots": "NOARCHIVE", "fb": {"admins": 1594068001, "app_id": 107464888913, "pages": 268914272540}, "msvalidate.01": "02916AAC0DA8B068EFE01D721E03ED7E", "parsely-section": "Politics", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/NYDailyNews/"}, "sailthru.description": "Mayor de Blasio admitted his Iowa presidential forum collapsed because no one wanted to go.", "viewport": "width=device-width, height=device-height, initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no", "og": {"site_name": "NY Daily News", "description": "Mayor de Blasio admitted his Iowa presidential forum collapsed because no one wanted to go.", "title": "De Blasio not deterred by Iowa forum failure", "url": "http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/de-blasio-not-deterred-iowa-forum-failure-article-1.2431765", "image": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2431764.1447285177!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/496503930.jpg", "type": "article"}, "parsely-image-url": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2431764.1447285177!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/496503930.jpg", "p": {"domain_verify": "78efe4f5c9935744af497772f68a0ee7"}, "nydn_byline": "ERIN DURKIN", "sailthru.credits": "DAILY NEWS CITY HALL BUREAU"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1ab9\"", "article_summary": "Mayor de Blasio admitted his Iowa presidential forum collapsed because no one wanted to go \u2014 but said his forays into national politics are far from over.\n\u201cDemocrats all over the country were not talking about income inequality.\nDe Blasio rejected criticism that his dabbling in national politics had backfired.\nDe Blasio had looked to the forum as a way to gauge candidates\u2019 commitment to fighting income inequality, but ended up endorsing Hillary Clinton before it happened amid disagreement within his own camp on whether he had waited too long.\nThey were not willing to talk about Obamacare even \u2014 they tried to disassociate themselves from their own President and their own party,\u201d he said."}
