The latest quarterly report reveals that two-thirds of SMB leaders are pessimistic about hopes for bipartisanship in the nation\u2019s capital; these sentiments align with Gallop\u2019s June report that Congressional approval has dropped to 16 percent and national satisfaction to 23 percent. While support for easing immigration requirements for highly skilled workers continues to be strong among SMB executives, more than half of the business leaders surveyed are against easing requirements for the general immigrant population. One-third of SMBs expect the Affordable Care Act will have a \u201clarge impact\u201d on their companies and more than half foresee negative consequences should the federal minimum wage be raised to $10.10 per hour.\n\nDespite seemingly negative perceptions of Washington politics, SMB executives across the country and from a variety of industries are moving forward with plans to expand and hire. A majority of respondents (69 percent) say they are optimistic about their economic prospects and nearly half report plans to hire new employees in the coming months.\n\n\u201cSmall and mid-sized businesses often are a bellwether for what is happening economically and politically,\u201d said Scott Smith, Chief Marketing Officer at Lucas Group. \u201cOur goal with the SMB quarterly report is to illustrate how major policy issues are playing out in the business world and how they shape the growth and hiring plans of SMBs. Even if ongoing debates in Washington weigh down the overall engine of the economy, SMB leaders remain optimistic about the health of their companies and are bullish on their plans for growth.\u201d\n\nThe Q2 survey, which gathered insights of 400 SMB top executives from across the country, comes as political rhetoric around immigration remains heated. Recently, President Obama said he plans to act administratively \u2013 with or without Congressional approval \u2013 on immigration before the midterm election, and with Congress out of session for August recess, several legislative proposals to address reform and assist in managing the border crisis sit idle.\n\nThis quarter, the survey registered its highest levels of anti-immigration reform sentiment among business leaders. Fifty-nine percent of those surveyed said they either disagree or disagree strongly that the United States should ease requirements for all immigrants. In the previous quarterly survey, 48 percent held a disagreeing view on overall immigration reform.\n\nBusiness leaders were only slightly more amenable to easing requirements for immigrants already in the United States, with 48 percent saying they disagreed or disagreed strongly with that policy. However, when it comes to easing requirements for immigrants in IT, science and other high-demand fields, SMB leaders are more agreeable. Nearly half (46 percent) said they either agree or agree strongly that the U.S. should ease requirements for skilled workers.\n\nAs for the President\u2019s signature health care reform, business leaders consistently list health care costs as their company\u2019s top challenge and many are concerned about the level of impact the law will have on their businesses. One-third of those surveyed said the Affordable Care Act will have a \u201clarge impact\u201d on their companies, up from 25 percent in Q1. Another 58 percent report the ACA will have a lesser impact, while only nine percent of SMBs expect no business impact related to the health care law.\n\nAn increasing number of businesses also appear to be actively preparing for the law\u2019s full implementation, with 41 percent of respondents stating their companies are ready, versus just 18 percent one year ago. A shrinking percentage of businesses are still waiting to act. Six percent of those surveyed said they have not done anything to prepare but plan to, while 10 percent say they won\u2019t do anything at all.\n\nApproximately half of the SMB leaders surveyed revealed that raising the federal minimum wage to $10.10 an hour may create a variety of negative consequences for their businesses. One-quarter said they would raise prices to end consumers, while 44 percent suggested either workforce reductions and/or hiring freezes would result. Similar to last quarter, three percent report that a $10.10 federal minimum wage would drive them to close their doors.\n\nBusiness concerns about the $10.10 rate, however, do not translate to an all-out rejection of a theoretical wage increase. When asked to share their ideal minimum wage (based on a sliding scale), two-thirds of SMBs revealed support for a wage higher than $8.20. While 31 percent wished to keep the rate between its current $7.25 per hour and $8.20 per hour, 46 percent of respondents felt that the $8.21\u2013$10.10 range was most ideal. Interestingly, 23 percent of SMB leaders chose answers in the rate range of $10.11\u201312.00 as most ideal \u2013 going beyond the proposed $10.10 increase.\n\nThe SMB Job Generation Outlook is conducted by Lucas Group in coordination with Polaris Marketing Research and Dr. Goutam Challagalla, Associate Professor at the Georgia Institute of Technology College of Business.
