As the President is desperately trying to get more young people to sign up for Obamacare, Jimmy Kimmel has a clue as to why they aren't terribly interested in paying for it. "They expect young people to buy insurance the same time the Playstation 4 came out?"

He then showed a fake commercial for Obamacare, which might be difficult to separate from the real thing. In the commercial, an older couple lays out the sad but probably true reason their health is prioritized over that of young people: "Because you don't vote, and we do."

Oh, and also, Medicare is apparently covering penis pumps now. Remember, kids, that Obamacare signup deadline is March 1.
