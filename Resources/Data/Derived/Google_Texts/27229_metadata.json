Jeff Van Gundy is an excellent analyst and Mike Breen remains adequate as the play-by-play man.\n\nThe other controversy transcends the sports scene for obvious reasons.\n\nESPN\u2019s decision to present Caitlyn (formerly Bruce) Jenner with the Arthur Ashe Courage Award during the ESPYs program has kicked off a huge debate \u2014 much of it nasty.\n\nThe network has been accused of honoring the former Olympic decathlon champion as an audience ratings ploy, which may or may not be true.\n\nStill, keep in mind that the ESPYs program will, for the first time, move from cable to ABC, which televised Diane Sawyer\u2019s lengthy interview and profile of Jenner in April.\n\nThe result was a spectacular audience response.\n\nThe ESPYs program, first aired in 1993, always is produced in Hollywood-entertainment style.\n\nI doubt that any young athlete dedicated to his or her sport is dedicated to winning a future ESPY award.\n\nMeanwhile, the Internet is alive with support for Lauren Hill as the posthumous Arthur Ashe Courage Award winner this year.\n\nHill, who was 19 when she died April 10, battled inoperable brain cancer and formed a nonprofit cancer research organization while continuing to play basketball for Mount St. Joseph University in Cincinnati.\n\nThe people she inspired included Cavaliers star LeBron James.\n\nAshe was a Grand Slam tennis star who was 49 when he died in 1993 of AIDS. He contracted HIV from a blood transfusion he received during heart surgery in the 1980s.\n\nAshe, who battled racial prejudice early in his tennis career, dedicated the final years of his life to his foundation, which still helps people with AIDS and HIV.\n\nLongtime Denver journalist Dusty Saunders writes about sports media each Monday in The Denver Post.
