Through technology and other changes, \u201cwe\u2019re going to have better health care and lower costs,\u2019\u2019 Dennis White, president and CEO of Alliant Health Solutions, told an audience at the Health IT Leadership Summit in Atlanta.

And the panel\u2019s medical data message appeared to play well with the audience of health IT professionals. Atlanta is a leading center of that industry.\n\nA revolution in health information technology can help bend the cost and quality curves in medical care, experts say. Currently, the United States far outspends any other country in health care, but its medical outcomes lag those of other industrialized nations.\n\n\u201cMathematically, when we look ahead, it\u2019s unsustainable,\u2019\u2019 said Robert Hendricks of McKesson Technology Solutions, a large health IT company based in Alpharetta.\n\nAlliant\u2019s White said he has already seen increased information on quality of care lead to improvements.\n\nThe federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, he noted, has posted information on hospital infection rates, so consumers can pick a facility based on quality. And the federal Medicare program, by penalizing hospitals for high numbers of readmissions of patients, has led to a decrease on those rates, White said.\n\nGeorgia was ranked as the worst state in its high use of antipsychotic drugs in nursing homes, White added. \u201cNow we\u2019re 34th, just by focusing on these indicators,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\n\u201cPatient engagement\u201d is necessary for change, Hendricks said.\n\nThat term includes tactics such as providers offering patients the ability to make appointments on their websites.\n\nThe Cleveland Clinic, for example, is putting lab results and medical imaging results online and eventually plans to post physicians\u2019 notes after each patient\u2019s visit, according to InformationWeek magazine. The Ohio organization also has a pilot project in the works that allows patients to enter data into their own records, which may help clinicians monitor patients\u2019 progress in controlling blood pressure, blood glucose and other measurable parameters.\n\nMcKesson\u2019s Hendricks said there\u2019s a balancing act between medical privacy concerns and the need for greater information.\n\nWith social media websites such as Facebook, he said, patients are yielding privacy protection in order to get more information about a health condition.\n\nHealth care is personal, he acknowledged. \u201cBut if I get diagnosed with some form of cancer, I don\u2019t care who knows. I want to know everything about it.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a starvation\u2019\u2019 for information, Hendricks said, citing a family member who said she knew much more information about buying a car than about her own cancer.\n\nA fourth member of the panel, state Insurance Commissioner Ralph Hudgens, said the immediate future of health care is imperiled by the Affordable Care Act. \u201cI really see a lot of problems,\u2019\u2019 said Hudgens, an outspoken critic of the law.\n\nYoung people are needed to balance the risk in the health insurance exchange, but they won\u2019t sign up because of the cost of premiums, Hudgens said. \u201cIf the young don\u2019t sign up, this will be a very, very losing proposition.\u2019\u2019\n\nBut he also said the law allowing higher premiums for smokers in the exchange is a good idea.\n\nGrady\u2019s Cancilla said digital health records allow different providers to track the progress of a patient.\n\nAnd she pushed the concept of predictive analytics \u2013 technology that could help hospitals understand which patients are most likely to need follow-up care \u2013 which she said can reduce hospitalizations.\n\nBut despite these technology advances, Cancilla said, \u201clet\u2019s not forget about the need for human interaction\u2019\u2019 between provider and patient.\n\nSee more at: http://www.georgiahealthnews.com/2013/11/technology-transform-health-care-panel/#sthash.Lt5TS43e.dpuf", "article_metadata": {"meta_title": "How Technology Can Transform Health Care", "medium": "News", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"site_name": "Georgia Public Broadcasting", "description": "The future of health care will feature greater use of electronic medical data, and more patients will be involved in their own care, a panel of health officials said Tuesday.
