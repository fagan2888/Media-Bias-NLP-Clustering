By closing in on the nomination, Trump is pitting conservatives\u2019 commitments to party and movement against one another. If most Republicans were to fall into line behind Trump, the Republican Party apparatus would reorient dramatically, but it would survive. If instead the party\u2019s leaders abandon Trump after promising otherwise, they would turn millions of people against the GOP enduringly. The damage to the Republican Party as an institution would be profound, perhaps fatal.\n\nTrump\u2019s nomination by itself would deal a huge blow to conservative movement infrastructure. The movement has thrived on the impression that it is the institutional and well-heeled face of a vast grassroots composed of committed, principled, ideological voters\u2013a potent combination that allowed it to take over the party. Trump\u2019s nomination would demonstrate that the movement was founded upon illusions\u2014that it\u2019s unable to shape campaigns, and that it represents an electorate that is actually more demagogic than philosophical.\n\nIf Rubio and other key GOP figures abandon Trump, they will be in effect committing to rebuild a similar ideological movement\u2014with the critical difference being that the new one will be shorn of the power to wield resentment and racial grievance to advance its ends. That poses a huge challenge to the imagination. The existing conservative party has become practically coextensive with the politics of resentment and grievance. It\u2019s almost impossible to think up a version of the GOP that has cashed them out to a breakaway Trump faction.\n\nTo understand why, look no further than this very election, which has been defined, with few exceptions, by Republican hopefuls following Trump\u2019s lead and appealing to his supporters. At the same time, Trump has co-opted and amplified articles of conservative faith (that President Obama is a disaster, that America is weak) in ways that will make it extremely difficult for Republican leaders to disavow Trump without also disavowing the grievance and resentment, too.\n\nFor instance, consider how feckless the Republican establishment\u2019s attacks on Trump have been thus far, and how unpersuasive a standard-issue Republican candidate would be in a general election campaign against him.\n\nIt is untenable to attack Trump for advancing a ludicrously skeletal alternative to the Affordable Care Act, when the Republican Party has no alternative of its own, and Trump\u2019s competitors offer little more clarity.\n\nIt is untenable to attack Trump for fiscal profligacy when nearly all conservative elites are aligned in consensus that the country urgently needs huge, regressive tax cuts, much more defense spending, and absolutely no immediate cuts to Social Security and Medicare.\n\nIt is untenable to attack Trump for refusing to say how he will provide health coverage to everyone\u2014a pledge he\u2019s repeatedly made\u2014when Republican leaders suggest their Obamacare alternatives, which will strip coverage from millions of Americans, won\u2019t disadvantage anyone.\n\nIt is untenable to attack Trump for promising to deport 11 million immigrants if you\u2019ve built party politics on the impression that the country is being inundated by immigrants, invaders, ISIS infiltrators, and disease carriers.\n\nIt is untenable to pretend that Trump\u2019s promise to finance a wall on another country\u2019s budget is somehow less fantastical than promising to sow enough chaos in immigrant communities that they\u2019ll leave the United States on their own.\n\nIt is untenable to attack Trump for saying the IRS might be auditing him because he\u2019s such a \u201cstrong Christian\u201d when you\u2019ve convinced nearly half the country that the IRS needs to be reined in or abolished because it has been illegally targeting Christians and conservatives in a campaign of political retribution.\n\nIt is untenable to attack Trump for being unelectable when you\u2019ve convinced nearly half the country that the other party\u2019s frontrunner is going to be indicted by the Justice Department for endangering national security.\n\nIt is untenable to attack Trump for refusing to disavow David Duke when a a guy who once described himself as \u201cDavid Duke without the baggage\u201d is now the third most powerful Republican in the House of Representatives.\n\nRemove this immense capacity for bullshit and self-deception from the party\u2019s political arsenal\u2014or at least render it ineffective\u2014and it\u2019s hard to envision what mobilization tools (and thus what policies) would replace it. There is an optimistic scenario in which a reconstituted conservative movement organizes around a more productive, less uncompromising politics.\n\nA new Republican Party (formed to confront Trump in the election, or in the aftermath of his defeat) would perhaps be more consistently attuned to the social concerns of religious voters\u2014pairing existing religious-right commitments like opposition to abortion and same-sex marriage with a more progressive distributive agenda aimed at reducing poverty and encouraging family growth. A party like that would be able to vie for Trump\u2019s supporters by promising to lift them up, rather than by stooping to their level, and would insure their losses among secular whites by appealing to devout but ideologically non-doctrinaire churchgoers.\n\nThis might not describe the pluralistic, tolerant Republican Party of liberal dreams, but it beats most of the easily imagined alternatives. If Republicans rally to Trump and he loses, it will embolden the purist, maximalist faction of the party led by Ted Cruz all over again. This faction will plausibly claim that, but for Trump, an orthodox conservative would have won the nomination and the presidency. Republicans will deploy the tactics they used against President Barack Obama against President Hillary Clinton, but with much more uniformity and zeal. On the other hand, if Republicans rally to Trump and he wins\u2014well, then liberals will face more pressing concerns than gaming out the GOP\u2019s uncertain future, or wondering what will become of the conservative movement as we know it.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "//assets.newrepublic.com/assets/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "Will the right fall in line behind him\u2014or make #NeverTrump a rallying cry?", "og": {"site_name": "New Republic", "description": "Will the right fall in line behind him\u2014or make #NeverTrump a rallying cry?", "title": "Donald Trump Confronts Conservatives With an Existential Crisis", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://images.newrepublic.com/2a2882f63a3ab1937f9e72a6ff4a3de2bcd00756.jpeg?w=1109&h=577&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg", "url": "https://newrepublic.com/article/130673/donald-trump-confronts-conservatives-existential-crisis", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Will the right fall in line behind him\u2014or make #NeverTrump a rallying cry?", "title": "Donald Trump Confronts Conservatives With an Existential Crisis", "image": "https://images.newrepublic.com/2a2882f63a3ab1937f9e72a6ff4a3de2bcd00756.jpeg?w=1024&h=512&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg", "creator": "@brianbeutler", "site": "@newrepublic", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#ffffff", "parsely-metadata": "{\"thumb_image\":\"http://images.newrepublic.com/2a2882f63a3ab1937f9e72a6ff4a3de2bcd00756.jpeg\"}", "parsely-page": "{\"title\":\"Donald Trump Confronts Conservatives With an Existential Crisis\",\"link\":\"https://newrepublic.com/article/130673/donald-trump-confronts-conservatives-existential-crisis\",\"section\":\"Donald Trump\",\"pub_date\":\"2016-02-29T11:00:00.000Z\",\"post_id\":130673,\"author\":\"Brian Beutler\",\"type\":\"post\",\"tags\":[\"Donald Trump\",\"Election 2016\",\"Marco Rubio\",\"Ted Cruz\",\"Barack Obama\",\"Hillary Clinton\",\"Republican Primary 2016\",\"Politics\",\"Chris Christie\",\"Paul LePage\",\"Jan Brewer\",\"-homepage-top\",\"-type_article\"]}", "fb": {"admins": 4404589, "pages": 161419311535, "app_id": 1675346479369918}, "msapplication-TileImage": "//assets.newrepublic.com/assets/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/thenewrepublic", "tag": "Donald Trump", "published_time": "2016-02-29"}, "theme-color": "#ffffff"}, "article_summary": "If most Republicans were to fall into line behind Trump, the Republican Party apparatus would reorient dramatically, but it would survive.\nThis might not describe the pluralistic, tolerant Republican Party of liberal dreams, but it beats most of the easily imagined alternatives.\nThere is an optimistic scenario in which a reconstituted conservative movement organizes around a more productive, less uncompromising politics.\nThe damage to the Republican Party as an institution would be profound, perhaps fatal.\nBy closing in on the nomination, Trump is pitting conservatives\u2019 commitments to party and movement against one another."}
