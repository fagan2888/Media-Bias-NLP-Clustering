But how can we do that when we\u2019re never taught how to take care of ourselves?\n\n\u2013\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of talk about \u201cman rules\u201d and things that men need to do in order to hold onto their \u201cman cards\u201d \u2013 work with your hands, know how to use power tools, win fights, all the usual \u201cmanly men doing manly things\u201d chest-thumping.\n\nWhat we don\u2019t talk about when it comes to manliness is simply \u201clearn how to handle your shit\u201d. The problem that many men face is that we\u2019re bad at taking care of ourselves. It\u2019s very rare that men are allowed to give their emotional health priority in their lives. More often than not, we rely on others \u2013 primarily women \u2013 to attend to our emotional needs. It\u2019s hard enough to even admit we have emotional needs, never mind act on them. We aren\u2019t supposed to complain or acknowledge when shit is going badly for us except via quiet stoic resolve. Admitting to having a problem is tantamount to admitting weakness and invites the traditional game of \u201cYou think you have it bad? Stop whining!\u201d\n\nNo matter who you are or where you are in your life, sometimes the world goes out of its way to stomp on your metaphorical nuts with giant shitty boots. Maybe you\u2019ve just gotten dumped. Maybe you\u2019ve lost your job. Or perhaps you\u2019ve been slamming your head against the unyielding wall that is your lousy dating life for too long and you can\u2019t take any more. Or sometimes life just fucking sucks and nothing seems like it would go right if you held a gun to its head. But the key to getting through these tough moments isn\u2019t to keep telling yourself \u201cstone don\u2019t cry\u201d. It\u2019s not to keep telling yourself that this isn\u2019t so bad and you\u2019re just a pussy for not being able to take more. It\u2019s to learn how to take care of yourself.\n\nBut at the same time, there\u2019s more to self-care than beer, bitching and a marathon of John McTiernan movies.\n\nSo let\u2019s look at some rules men need to follow\u2026\n\n1) Be Willing To Ask For Help\n\nOne of the first things that guys need to learn: sometimes you need to be willing to ask for help.\n\nyou need to address your core problems before you start trying to treat the lesser ones. Case in point: I hear from men regularly who want help with their dating lives because they\u2019ve convinced themselves that finding a girlfriend will be the magic cure for everything that ails them. Once they find Ms. Right (or Ms. You\u2019ll Do or Ms. Right Now), everything will fall into place \u2013 they\u2019ll no longer feel like losers, people will respect them and they\u2019ll be magically better people. But when you drill past the external problem (they\u2019re single) you quickly get to the real issues: they\u2019re dealing with depression. They\u2019re suffering from low self-esteem. They don\u2019t believe they deserve to be happy. They have poor boundaries and no emotionally fulfilling relationships with other people. These core problems inform every other aspect of their lives, but they treat sex and dating as the cure-all that will transform them into better men.\n\nExcept that\u2019s not how life works \u2013 dating somebody doesn\u2019t make your emotional issues disappear. Somebody with low self-esteem who gets into a relationship is just going to find that they\u2019re continually relying on their partner for security and reassurance \u2013 and will very quickly find themselves without a relationship. Dating somebody doesn\u2019t make your depression go away; all too often, what it means is that you\u2019re now expecting somebody else to nurse you through it. This is the emotional equivalent of assuming that pulling out this splinter in your finger will cure your sucking chest-wound.\n\nBut it\u2019s easier (theoretically) to deal with comparatively minor issues like dating success than it is to deal with core problems like depression or anxiety. The problem is that we tend to not want to admit that we have these issues in the first place.\n\nBeing \u201cmanly \u201cmeans \u201cplaying through the pain\u201d. It means not whining or admitting defeat. It means not letting something like \u201cthe blues\u201d get you down. But those deep-seated emotional issues can\u2019t be cured by willpower and external validation. At best, you make yourself numb for a little while\u2026 and as any real doctor will tell you, not feeling pain isn\u2019t the same as not being hurt.\n\nYou need to learn how to handle your shit\u2026 and that means being willing to ask for help when the problem goes deeper than just needing a pep-talk or two. Too many men see asking for help as a cop-out, an admission that they just couldn\u2019t hack it. When the macho football player decides that he\u2019s had enough of constant harassment from his teammates, people call him a wuss and a wimp for\u2026 going and seeking help. It conflicts with the supposed manly ideal \u2013 that \u201ctrue\u201d men can handle everything the world dishes out; they just chew it up, spit it out and ask for seconds. Taking time to open up to a stranger? That\u2019s for \u201cbeta\u201d males.\n\nBut asking for help is one of the strongest things you can do. Being willing to admit that you can\u2019t do something on your own is the surest sign of strength \u2013 you\u2019re showing greater security in who you are and the rightness of your cause than someone who needs to put up the false \u201calpha\u201d front lest others detect weakness.\n\nSometimes shit will be too much for you to handle alone. You need to recognize that you can and should find the help that you need. And if money is a factor, the ever-excellent Captain Awkward has a terrific guide to finding low-cost or even free mental health care.\n\n2) Find The Things That Speak To Your Soul\n\nNo matter how #blessed your life may be, it\u2019s going to take it\u2019s toll on you. There are going to be days that hit you like a punch to the gut and then kick you in the balls for good measure. Other times, it will be a long, slow drain of your soul, leaving you feeling empty and hollow inside and wondering what the point of it all is.\n\nWhether it\u2019s a sudden fall or a slow decline, there will be times you\u2019ll find yourself beaten down to the ground. And when you\u2019re flat on your back and feeling like you\u2019ve been run over by a rampaging T-Rex, you\u2019re going to need to find inspiration to get back up again. You don\u2019t need to leap to your feet and be ready to charge back into the fight \u2013 you just want the things that rejuvenate you, that make you feel better and remind you of the joy and beauty in the world.\n\nIt\u2019s good to do things that make you feel better physically, whether it\u2019s a long hot soak, a massage, or indulging in a favorite meal, but it\u2019s just as important to do the things that make you feel good on an emotional and spiritual level. Men have a tendency of prioritizing the physical needs over the emotional ones, but your spirit needs nurturing as much as your body does.\n\nThis is why it\u2019s important to find the things that fulfill you emotionally and spiritually. It could be something as simple as visiting art galleries and museums and taking in the wonder of people\u2019s creativity. It could be going to the movies, whether they\u2019re subtitled foreign films or trashy, junkfood cinema. It may be listening to music or taking long walks in nature.\n\nNo matter what it is, it should be something that makes you look forward to getting out of bed each day. If you don\u2019t have anything like that in your life, then you want to find it. Something, no matter how small, strange or niche, that gets you excited \u2013 even when you feel like you\u2019ll never feel happiness or joy \u2013 is huge when it comes to self-care.\n\n3) If You Haven\u2019t Got Your Health, You Haven\u2019t Got Anything\n\nNurturing your soul is important \u2013 but so is taking care of your body, and that frequently can fall by the wayside when things go badly. I\u2019m certainly not going to tell you not to enjoy your favorite comfort foods or that you can\u2019t indulge yourself on occasion, but it\u2019s very easy to throw your hands in the air and say \u201cfuck it all\u201d when the shit hits the fan. However, those are the times when taking care of your body is even more important than ever.\n\nThe things that you put in your body have a direct connection to your mood and emotional state. Most convenience foods are overloaded with sugar and salt in a bid to make them literally more addictive. The added sugar, salt and fat affect the brain the same way that cocaine and heroin do, complete with the unpleasant come-down, hang overs and withdrawal symptoms. The constant wave of euphoria and withdrawal leaves you emotionally exhausted as well as encouraging you to eat lousy, non-nutritious crap which, in turn, continues to affect your emotional well-being as much as your physical.\n\nThis is why you want to eat clean as much as possible. This means trying to keep to unprocessed foods, avoiding foods with added sugar or salt or sweeteners like high-fructose corn syrup as best you can.\n\nEating a diet comprised of lean proteins, complex carbohydrates like sprouted grains and green, leafy vegetables will not just improve your physical health but your emotional and mental health as well \u2013 a healthy diet improves brain function and energy levels, as well as improving how you look, which makes you feel better.\n\nSimilarly, you want to drink more water \u2013 not only will it flush out the toxins in your system in ways that \u201ccleanses\u201d won\u2019t, but it will improve your mood. Most people don\u2019t drink enough water in general; you don\u2019t need to follow the \u201c8 glasses of water per day\u201d rule (it\u2019s a myth), but you should up your water intake \u2013 especially instead of sodas or even overly-sugared fruit juices.\n\nJust as important: you need to move.\n\nOur bodies are designed for movement, not for sitting around \u2013 in fact, our sedentary lifestyle is actively hurting us, physically and mentally. One of the best things you can do for yourself, both in terms of your physical and emotional health is simply to move more. You don\u2019t necessarily need to be hitting the gym like it owes you money (although it certainly won\u2019t hurt\u2026) or running marathons, but you do need to increase the amount of physical activity you get during the day. Whether it\u2019s as involved as a pick-up game of basketball, yoga or simply going on regular walks, the more you move, the better you\u2019ll feel.\n\n4) Find Your Community. Find the Right Community\n\nOne of the most important parts of self-care is finding your \u201cteam\u201d. Your community, your family-by-choice, whatever you may call it, we are social animals and it\u2019s important to have people who support and encourage you. The problem is that it can be surprisingly difficult to make new friends once you\u2019ve graduated from college. Being in school makes finding friends much easier \u2013 you\u2019re surrounded by people approximately your age and in the same place in life as you are and a greater amount of time to spend socializing. Once you\u2019re out in the \u201creal world\u201d, you simply don\u2019t have the same community pool or the time to spend forming new social bonds.\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not still important. Loneliness and emotional isolation take their toll on the psyche, even in introverts; finding your community brings a level of emotional connection and corresponding levels of well-being. Sometimes it\u2019s a matter of joining groups based around shared interests \u2013 tabletop gaming for example or amateur sports leagues. Sometimes it\u2019s finding MeetUp groups based around your passions, volunteer opportunities or reconnecting with your religion and spending time with like-minded individuals. Even finding online communities can help foster those feelings of connection and belonging.\n\nBut you want to make sure you pick the right community. A great group of friends can make you feel amazing. The wrong group on the other hand, can be profoundly toxic and detrimental to your emotional well-being.\n\nAs the saying goes: you are the sum of the five people you hang out with most. Spending time with toxic assholes only fosters the most negative sides of your personality and generally making you a shittier human being. Or, you might be spending time with people who drain the life out of you and leave you feeling like shit at the end of the day.\n\nUnfortunately, many groups thrive on negativity \u2013 they become about blaming others, defending themselves against perceived and imagined wrongs rather than supporting and encouraging one another. It\u2019s very easy to get caught up in the group-think, especially in closed communities online where the echo-chamber effect serves to encourage and amplify the voices of the most extreme members.\n\nAny community focused on negativity or shirking personal responsibility and placing the blame on others is one you don\u2019t want to be part of. If you want to be a better, more interesting person, you want to surround yourself with people who feel the same way and work to encourage and build one another up instead of tearing down some nebulous \u201cenemy\u201d. Find and focus your energy on people who support and encourage you to be your best.\n\n5) Take A Break\n\nSometimes in any endeavor \u2013 whether it\u2019s self-improvement, getting better at dating or chasing some other goal \u2013 is to simply stop for a while. We\u2019re taught over and over again to chase after our dreams with endless tenacity and to never, ever give up\u2026 which is great for motivational speeches but it\u2019s also a wonderful way to encourage burnout. Chasing a dream is great\u2026 until it becomes so tedious and painful that it\u2019s akin to sandpapering your soul day in and day out.\n\nBut admitting that we need to stop and take a breather feels almost tantamount to treason. It\u2019s as though we believe that if we don\u2019t give our all \u2013 even at the cost of our sanity and soul \u2013 then we just don\u2019t want it bad enough. I hear from people on a regular basis who are desperate for a break from the dating grind, yet don\u2019t seem to realize that taking time off is an option. Instead they\u2019re writing to me, essentially asking for permission to stop for a while.\n\nThat is absolutely bat-shit insane. They\u2019re pounding their head against a particular wall over and over again to the point that the blood is dripping into their eyes and yet there\u2019s still that little voice saying \u201cYou have to keep going\u201d.\n\nBut dating is supposed to be fun. Pursuing a goal should be something that brings you fulfillment not endless frustration. It may not be easy, but when the pursuit is beginning to cost more than the reward is worth\u2026 well it\u2019s time to at least give yourself a break.\n\nThink of it like playing an especially impossible part of a video game \u2013 you keep dying at the same point over and over and goddamn over again. You reload, you die, you scream and the cycle repeats itself. Your entire world becomes beating that one. GODDAMN. SECTION.\n\nIt\u2019s long ceased to be fun. In fact, it\u2019s become a major source of stress. And yet you still want to just conquer this thing. But the best thing you can do is simply\u2026 put the controller down and walk a way for a while. Give yourself a break. Let yourself recharge and come back when you\u2019re ready. When you\u2019re not so monomoniacally focused, when it\u2019s not consuming your entire being, you find that you\u2019re able to approach the problem with a fresh set of eyes. You see what you\u2019ve been doing wrong and you\u2019re not so fatigued that you can\u2019t respond the way you need to.\n\nSo it is with many things in life. Whether it\u2019s dating or any other activity, sometimes the best thing you can do for yourself is simply get off the ride for a while. It doesn\u2019t mean giving up forever\u2026 just long enough until you\u2019re ready to try again. Give yourself time to relax, to recover and to recharge. Spend that time on the things that bring you joy and that help you regain your strength. Taking time out to take care of yourself will make it that much easier to come back to it. And when you do come back you\u2019ll be tanned, rested and ready to give the old town a wedgie again.\n\nWhen it all becomes too much, give yourself permission to put it on pause. Focus on the other aspects of your life for a while. It\u2019ll be waiting for you when you get back.\n\nAnd you\u2019ll be in the perfect position to show the world who\u2019s boss.\n\nDo you want to be part of creating a kinder, more inclusive society?\n\n\u2013\n\nOriginally appeared at Paging Dr NerdLove\n\n", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Good Men Project", "description": "Being a man means learning how to handle your sh*t.
