That's where Sheriff Jackie Knight says Orlando Smith was shot once in the stomach. Sheriff Knight tells Newscenter 11 Smith was attempting to gain entry into his ex-girlfriend's house when she shot him with a 12-gauge shotgun. Smith was immediately flown to University Medical Center in Jackson where he is in intensive care.\n\nThe sheriff says this is not the first run-in his department has had with the ex-boyfriend and girlfriend. He tells us his deputies responded to a call at the home on Newton Bethel Road just a short time before the shooting. Knight says Smith ran into the woods that time. Then this past Friday, Sheriff Knight tells us Smith's ex-girlfriend filed an affidavit against him for kidnapping her this past week.\n\nOnce Smith gets out of the hospital, Knight says he will face kidnapping charges.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "video", "description": "Authorities say a man was taken to UMC in Jackson after being shot in the stomach in Newton County.", "language": "english", "author": "Chip Scarborough", "og": {"description": "Authorities say a man was taken to UMC in Jackson after being shot in the stomach in Newton County.", "title": "Newton County Shooting Sends Man to Jackson Hospital", "url": "http://www.wtok.com/home/headlines/Newton-County-Shooting-Sends-Man-to-Jackson-Hospital--275081341.html", "image": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/C91/017/C910170C1CAC48B2AE6A3151D58CF9F5", "video": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/B05/229/B052295201184D448710BB5F6FD951EF.mp4", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.wtok.com", "description": "Authorities say a man was taken to UMC in Jackson after being shot in the stomach in Newton County.", "title": "Newton County Shooting Sends Man to Jackson Hospital", "url": "http://www.wtok.com/home/headlines/Newton-County-Shooting-Sends-Man-to-Jackson-Hospital--275081341.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/crime+scene+shooting.jpeg", "creator": "@newscenter11", "site": "@newscenter11", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "video_type": "video/mp4", "video_height": 288, "keywords": "Newton County Shooting Sends Man to Jackson Hospital", "google-site-verification": "M1YwZ85zoJ2ZNboZjzjADGJ9L53qqzbNOi6FLrtDw9U", "video_width": 512, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Newton County Shooting Sends Man"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc4c6\"", "article_summary": "The Newton County Sheriff's Department was called to the scene of a shooting in the 1100 block of Newton Bethel Road.\nA Newton County man is in a Jackson hospital after being shot early Sunday morning.\nThen this past Friday, Sheriff Knight tells us Smith's ex-girlfriend filed an affidavit against him for kidnapping her this past week.\nSheriff Knight tells Newscenter 11 Smith was attempting to gain entry into his ex-girlfriend's house when she shot him with a 12-gauge shotgun.\nHe tells us his deputies responded to a call at the home on Newton Bethel Road just a short time before the shooting."}
