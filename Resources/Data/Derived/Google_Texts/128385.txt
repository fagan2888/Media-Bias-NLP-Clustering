Newell, SD

A western South Dakota man who got his start as a master of leather crafts selling chaps behind the chutes at rodeos now sells hundreds of pairs around the world.



Jack Gully and his wife, Kelly, have owned and operated K Bar J Leather Co. in Newell for more than a decade. The shop employs about 10 workers, most of whom work on chaps, while some of the others etch designs into leather with lasers.



The Tri-State Neighbor reports Jack and Kelly Gully each have their own specialty. He focuses on gun holsters and knife cases, while she makes purses and bags.



Jack Gully estimates he's sold 70,000 chaps and shipped some of them internationally, including to Europe and Australia.



Newell is about 25 miles east of Belle Fourche.
