A 29-year-old Dallas man died Saturday morning after losing control of his car while exiting the highway near Red Bird.

A police report indicates that Phineas Turner Blackâ€™s Pontiac sedan was veering off Interstate 20 when he crossed a concrete drive and crashed into a tree just before 2 a.m. Police listed the address of the wreck as 39700 LBJ Freeway, as that stretch of the interstate is considered part of the LBJ loop.

Firefighters responded to the scene and took him by ambulance to Methodist Hospital, where he was pronounced dead soon after. Black was the only person inside the car. No other vehicles were involved in the wreck.
