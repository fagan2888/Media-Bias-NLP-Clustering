In fact, Hastert took on a wide variety of clients and issues as a lobbyist \u2014 some almost as obscure as Hastert was when he became speaker in 1999.\n\nSome ex-lawmakers, such as former Sen. Mary Landrieu (D-La.), choose lobbying positions that allow them to focus on certainly policy areas, like energy. Hastert had some clients that were interested in that issue \u2014 Servicemaster Co., REX American Resources Corp and Peabody Energy, for instance \u2014 but a look at the clients that used the firm and his services for multiple years from 2009-2015 indicates no particular area of specialty.\n\nIn 2009, for example, Hastert lobbied on behalf of Centerpoint Properties, a Chicago-based real estate developer, on the issue of \u201csiting of [an] intermodal transportation facility on Army Reserve property\u201d \u2014 for which Dickstein was paid $30,000. In 2013 and 2014, Centerpoint again hired Hastert, this time dealing with federal requirements on decontamination and redevelopment of land, among other issues (the firm received over $140,000 in total for those two years).\n\nIn 2012 and 2013, the firm amassed $270,000 when Hastert lobbied on social policy issues such as the Affordable Care Act on behalf of the Texas Municipal League Intergovernmental Employee Benefits Pool, whereas he helped bring in $160,000 when he lobbied on behalf of consulting firm IHS Inc. in 2013 and 2014 on issues including defense and homeland security agency appropriations.\n\nThe big bucks really came in, however, when from 2011-2014, Dickstein Shapiro received $7.89 million in compensation thanks to a lobbying team including Hastert that went to bat for tobacco company Lorillard Inc. Maybe the most offbeat client Hastert took on in recent years was the Miami-based Pritikin Longevity Center & Spa, which used him in 2014 and 2015 to lobby Congress on legislation relating to \u201cMedicare coverage for chronic cardiac patients\u201d in exchange for $30,000.\n\nBanks? They don\u2019t really show up in Hastert\u2019s eclectic book of clients. So maybe there\u2019s at least a grain of truth in his claim to the FBI (the one that triggered the charge that he lied) that he withdrew large amounts of cash due to a mistrust of the banking system \u2014 not as hush money to keep someone from coming forward about misconduct by the former speaker back in his days as a wrestling coach.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "OpenSecrets Blog", "description": "Former House Speaker Dennis Hastert's (R-Ill.) indictment Thursday by the Justice Department on charges of evading cash transaction reporting requirements and lying to the FBI came\u00a0as something of a shock to many, in part because Hastert has led a pretty low-key life as a lobbyist at Dickst", "title": "Denny Hastert, the eclectic lobbyist", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://www.opensecrets.org/news/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/box66_swearing_in_108th_congress_1.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-05-29T13:17:17+00:00", "url": "http://www.opensecrets.org/news/2015/05/denny-hastert-the-eclectic-lobbyist/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"section": "Politicians & Elections", "published_time": "2015-05-29T13:17:17+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-05-29T13:17:17+00:00"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fccbeb\"", "article_summary": "In fact, Hastert took on a wide variety of clients and issues as a lobbyist \u2014 some almost as obscure as Hastert was when he became speaker in 1999.\nThey don\u2019t really show up in Hastert\u2019s eclectic book of clients.\nIn 2009, for example, Hastert lobbied on behalf of Centerpoint Properties, a Chicago-based real estate developer, on the issue of \u201csiting of [an] intermodal transportation facility on Army Reserve property\u201d \u2014 for which Dickstein was paid $30,000.\nIn 2013 and 2014, Centerpoint again hired Hastert, this time dealing with federal requirements on decontamination and redevelopment of land, among other issues (the firm received over $140,000 in total for those two years).\n), choose lobbying positions that allow them to focus on certainly policy areas, like energy."}
