Iqbal and his accomplices chased her and hit her with bricks.\"\n\nIqbal says they married for love in January. On Friday, he told Reuters that he and his wife were attacked by her family outside the High Court in Lahore, Pakistan's cultural capital. [ID:nL6N0OG2M5]\n\nIqbal dismissed her accusations.\n\n\"It's all rubbish and a bundle of lies,\" he told Reuters. \"She wants to hold me responsible for her sister\u2019s murder which was committed by her own father, brothers and other family members.\"\n\nIn a dark twist, Iqbal has admitted that he had killed his first wife in a dispute over Farzana in 2009.\n\nKhalida Bibi said she had spent 13 days with Farzana in a women's shelter last month where she said she was hiding from Iqbal.\n\n\"She told me that Iqbal had kidnapped her and forced her into marriage,\" she said. \"She feared that Iqbal might kill her like his previous wife, Ayesha.\"\n\nPolice have arrested five people including Farzana's father.\n\nThe fact that the murder happened in broad daylight outside one of Pakistan's top courts drew more attention to the case than is usual in most \"honor killings\" which are uncommon in a country where many conservative families consider it shameful for a woman to fall in love and choose her own husband.\n\nIn 2013, 869 such killings were reported in the media, according to the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan, and the true figure is probably higher since many cases go unreported.\n\n(Writing by Maria Golovnina;
