Sure there are lots of very important speaker events you can go and see with chewy titles like Are There Natural Rights? Do Constitutions Work? and Business Opportunities in the Emerging, Legal Marijuana Market.\n\nYou will also find yourself in many, many conversations where you hear phrases like \u201cBitcoin is the new gold\u201d and \u201cNo, really, bitcoin really is the new gold and gold is so over\u201d, \u201cYou\u2019ve got to go to this new casino where you can, like, gamble in bitcoin,\u201d and \u201cwhere do I go to get some of that Nevada medical marijuana?\u201d\n\nBut really\u2013a bit like its more staid conservative cousin CPAC\u2013the real point of FreedomFest is for like-minded folk to hang out in an environment where, for once, they\u2019re not made to feel like freaks, heretics, or social Darwinian haters and to pretend for a few happy days that Obama\u2019s America doesn\u2019t exist and that the future looks once again like some shining city on a hill where government is small, taxes are low, the Constitution is revered, and liberty reigns.\n\nAnd is this going to happen?\n\nWell it\u2019s less impossible than you might think, according to Nick Gillespie, editor in chief of Reason.com and Reason TV, whom I interviewed for Breitbart news. Reason has been doing some research into the Millennial generation (18 to 29 year olds) who did so much to vote Obama into power and has discovered they\u2019re not nearly as knee-jerk left as you might fear.\n\nSure, they quite often self-describe as \u201csocialist\u201d but only because they\u2019re victims of a dumbed-down education system and don\u2019t understand the meaning of the term. Press them on their views and you discover that though they are socially liberal (67 per cent favour same sex marriage; 57 per cent want to legalise marijuana), they lean fiscally more to the right\u2013at least according to this Reason-Rupe survey.\n\nAccording to the survey:\n\n64 percent of millennials say cutting government spending by 5 percent would help the economy\n\n59 percent say cutting taxes would help the economy\n\n57 percent prefer a smaller government providing fewer services with low taxes, while 41 percent prefer a larger government providing more services with high taxes\n\n57 percent want a society where wealth is distributed according to achievement\n\n55 percent say reducing regulations would help the economy\n\n53 percent say reducing the size of government would help the economy\n\nBut though they mistrust government, they define themselves by their social conscience and appear to be somewhat politically confused.\n\n69 percent say it is government\u2019s responsibility to guarantee everyone access to health care and 51 percent have a favorable view of the Affordable Care Act\n\n68 percent say government should ensure everyone makes a living wage\n\n66 percent say raising taxes on the wealthy would help the economy\n\n63 percent say spending more on job training would help the economy\n\n58 percent say the government should spend more on assistance to the poor \u00e5\n\n57 percent favor spending more money on infrastructure\n\n54 percent favor a larger government that provides more services, when taxes are not mentioned\n\nThis tallies with similar research in the UK. Just before I left there was a BBC radio documentary into precisely this phenomenon. Millennials are socially conscious and keen on a welfare safety net\u2013but they only want it for the genuinely needy rather than for lazy scroungers. They believe if you work hard for your money you should benefit from it and they don\u2019t think profit is a dirty word.\n\nBoth the GOP in the US and the Conservative party in Britain need to work on this. There\u2019s room for a lot more fiscal boldness than the squishes and milksops among them might think.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Stage a conference of libertarians, pot-legalisers, gun nuts, and gold bugs in a city of booze, whores, gambling and semi-automatics: what could possibly go wrong?", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Stage a conference of libertarians, pot-legalisers, gun nuts, and gold bugs in a city of booze, whores, gambling and semi-automatics: what could possibly go wrong?", "title": "Socially Liberal but Fiscally Conservative: The Dope-Smoking Millennials Who Could Yet Save the World from Ever-Bigger Government - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Big-Government/2014/07/11/pot-smoking-millenial-AP.jpg", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2014/07/11/socially-liberal-but-fiscally-conservative/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Stage a conference of libertarians, pot-legalisers, gun nuts, and gold bugs in a city of booze, whores, gambling and semi-automatics: what could possibly go wrong?", "title": "Socially Liberal but Fiscally Conservative: The Dope-Smoking Millennials Who Could Yet Save the World from Ever-Bigger Government - Breitbart", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Big-Government/2014/07/11/pot-smoking-millenial-AP.jpg", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true", "app_id": 1243316582352556}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": ",Big Government,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Big Government", "published_time": "2014-07-11T13:18:00-07:00", "categories": "Big Government"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca6a4\"", "article_summary": "Both the GOP in the US and the Conservative party in Britain need to work on this.\nMillennials are socially conscious and keen on a welfare safety net\u2013but they only want it for the genuinely needy rather than for lazy scroungers.\nSure there are lots of very important speaker events you can go and see with chewy titles like Are There Natural Rights?\nThere\u2019s room for a lot more fiscal boldness than the squishes and milksops among them might think.\nThis is what I\u2019ve come to FreedomFest in Las Vegas to find out and it also may explain some of the recent radio silence."}
