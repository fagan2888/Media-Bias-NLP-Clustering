Residents should report wild animals showing signs of unusual behavior to the police department. In addition, residents should avoid contact with wild animals and immediately report any bites from wild or domestic animals to the local health department and consult a physician as soon as possible. Residents should also make sure all family pets are up to date on their rabies vaccinations and licenses.\n\nRabies is caused by a virus which can infect all warm-blooded mammals, including people. The rabies virus is found in the saliva of a rabid animal and is transmitted by a bite, or possibly by contamination of an open cut. New Jersey is enzootic for raccoon and bat variants of rabies. Bats, raccoons, skunks, groundhogs, foxes, cats, and dogs represent about 95% of animals diagnosed with rabies in the United States.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://mycj.co/1FISm17", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "A raccoon spotted in the area of Whitehall and Agate roads has tested positive for rabies, according to the Middlesex County Office of Health Services", "og": {"site_name": "MY CENTRAL JERSEY", "description": "A raccoon spotted in the area of Whitehall and Agate roads has tested positive for rabies, according to the Middlesex County Office of Health Services", "title": "Rabid raccoon found in East Brunswick", "url": "http://www.mycentraljersey.com/story/news/local/middlesex-county/2015/04/10/rabid-raccoon-found-east-brunswick/25602445/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/mycentraljersey.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A raccoon spotted in the area of Whitehall and Agate roads has tested positive for rabies, according to the Middlesex County Office of Health Services", "title": "Rabid raccoon found in East Brunswick", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/e1e291e946352566bd75bcfa866e92259ab667af/c=366-0-2112-1746&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/Bridgewater/2015/04/10/B9316939123Z.1_20150410182123_000_G84AFK574.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@MyCentralJersey", "site": "@MyCentralJersey", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=859380356", "fb": {"app_id": 177893718898560}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": "rabid raccoon, East Brunswick, Whitehall Road, Agate Road"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc3d3\"", "article_summary": "(Photo: ~File) Story Highlights A raccoon got in a fight with an East Brunswick resident\u2019s dogsThe raccoon died.\nThis is the first rabid animal reported within Middlesex County this year and the first rabid animal reported in East Brunswick, county officials said in a new release Friday.\nIn addition, a Middlesex County Office of Health Services\u2019 registered environmental health specialist will be distributing rabies fact sheets in the East Brunswick area.\nOn Wednesday, an East Brunswick animal control officer responded to a call about a raccoon which had been in a fight with a resident\u2019s dogs.\nThe Middlesex County Office of Health Services is reporting that a raccoon tested positive for rabies in Carteret in the vicinity of Hastings Place and Wedgewood Drive."}
