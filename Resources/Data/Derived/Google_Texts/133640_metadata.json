In a op-ed titled \u201cHealth Reform Realities,\u201d Krugman argues that though Obamacare is \u201ca kludge: a somewhat awkward, clumsy device with lots of moving parts,\u201d it works:\n\nHealth reform is the signature achievement of the Obama presidency. It was the biggest expansion of the social safety net since Medicare was established in the 1960s. It more or less achieves a goal \u2014 access to health insurance for all Americans \u2014 that progressives have been trying to reach for three generations. And it is already producing dramatic results, with the percentage of uninsured Americans falling to record lows.\n\nIn other words, the Affordable Care Act was a big win for us against Republicans, who fought any reform at all. Most will remember the failed Bill Clinton attempt to get healthcare reform done during his administration. As Krugman puts it,\n\nThe question for progressives \u2014 a question that is now central to the Democratic primary \u2014 is whether these failings mean that they should re-litigate their own biggest political success in almost half a century, and try for something better.\n\nMost Democrats probably agree that single payer is better than what we have. It is what most of us wanted to begin with, after all. But how practical is it as a goal? Krugman reminds us that we barely got Obamacare even with a Democratic controlled Senate. If single payer had been a possibility, we would already have it.\n\nBut we don\u2019t.\n\nThis is a big bone of contention now between Sanders and Clinton. Jason Easley wrote here regarding the Democratic debate:\n\nFormer Sec. of State Clinton\u2019s argument is that the country should not tear up with Affordable Care Act and start over again with a new debate would set the country back. Bernie Sanders argued that his Medicare for all plan would cover the 29 million people who still don\u2019t have healthcare. Sanders said what this debate is really about is whether \u201cwe have the guts to stand up to the health insurance industry and the pharmaceutical companies. Clinton pointed out that during the ACA debate Democrats could not get support for the public option. Clinton clearly has been shaped by her experience in the 1990s of trying to pass healthcare reform. The debate within the Democratic Party comes down to whether Democrats should stay on ACA path or take a shot at Medicare for all.\n\nIn Krugman\u2019s opinion, the candidates should \u201cfocus their main efforts on other issues.\u201d You know, those we haven\u2019t already won, even if the victory was not all we had hoped for. Krugman lists the many problems with pushing for single payer, including the massive influence of the insurance companies, the necessity of raising taxes to pay for it \u2013 not only the rich but the middle class \u2013 and the disruption to people who already have insurance they are satisfied with.\n\nKrugman makes a powerful argument when he says \u201cprogressives must set some priorities,\u201d and calls Sander\u2019s goal of single payer \u201ca quixotic attempt at a do-over, not of a political failure, but of health reform \u2014 their biggest victory in many years.\u201d Any president only has so much political capital. There are battles we haven\u2019t fought and won \u2013 to any degree whatsoever \u2013 that it might make more reasonable objectives for an incoming president.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Paul Krugman has entered the healthcare reform fray on behalf of Hillary Clinton, a fact which will no doubt disappoint many progressives.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "author": "Hrafnkell Haraldsson", "og": {"site_name": "Politicus USA", "description": "Paul Krugman has entered the healthcare reform fray on behalf of Hillary Clinton, a fact which will no doubt disappoint many progressives.", "title": "Paul Krugman Says Hillary Clinton is Right and Bernie Sanders is Wrong on Healthcare", "url": "http://www.politicususa.com/2016/01/18/paul-krugman-hillary-bernie-wrong-healthcare.html", "image": "http://15130-presscdn-0-89.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/krugman-obama-this-week.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-01-18T16:19:44+00:00", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 523732690, "app_id": 113462415332922, "pages": 186473214703370}, "keywords": "2016 Elections,Featured News,affordable care act,Bernie Sanders,Democratic Party,Hillary Clinton,Obamacare,Paul Krugman,politicususa,liberal,politics,sarah jones,jason easley,barack obama,msnbc,media", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/PoliticusUSA", "section": "Featured News", "published_time": "2016-01-18T16:12:36+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-01-18T16:19:44+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "affordable care act, Bernie Sanders, Democratic Party, Hillary Clinton, Obamacare, Paul Krugman"}, "article_summary": "Paul Krugman has entered the healthcare reform fray on behalf of Hillary Clinton, a fact which will no doubt disappoint many progressives.\nMost will remember the failed Bill Clinton attempt to get healthcare reform done during his administration.\nClinton clearly has been shaped by her experience in the 1990s of trying to pass healthcare reform.\nMost Democrats probably agree that single payer is better than what we have.\nIt more or less achieves a goal \u2014 access to health insurance for all Americans \u2014 that progressives have been trying to reach for three generations."}
