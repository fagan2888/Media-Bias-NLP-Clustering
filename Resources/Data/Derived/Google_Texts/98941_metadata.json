Diane Black (R-TN), Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), Bill Huizenga (R-MI), Fred Upton (R-MI), Todd Young (R-IN), Rep. Brett Guthrie (R-KY), Reps. Dan Newhouse (R-WA) and Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-WA).\n\n\u201cThey say it can\u2019t be done, that Washington is broken, and nobody is listening. They say we\u2019ll never balance America\u2019s budget, that we can\u2019t repeal Obamacare and nobody can reform Medicare to protect seniors and doctors or take on the big issues. But they aren\u2019t talking about Congresswoman Renee Ellmers,\u201d Politico quotes the narrator in an ad for the North Carolina Republican Ellmers.\n\nThe AAN is the same organization that ran ads against House conservatives during the Department of Homeland Security funding battle, spending $400,000 against Republicans who wanted to continue the fight against executive amnesty via the appropriations process. That angered conservatives in and out of Congress.\n\nHouse Leadership denied participation in the ads at the time, and Boehner spokesman Kevin Smith told The Hill that the Speaker did not think the ads were \u201cappropriate and \u201cstrongly believes in Ronald Reagan\u2019s 11th Commandment.\u201d\n\nThe group also spent another $525,000 thanking House Republicans who supported leadership\u2019s move to fully fund the Department without taking action on executive amnesty.\n\nWhile leadership has distanced itself from the group, the organization\u2019s board includes establishment and leadership allies including former Boehner chief-of-staff Barry Jackson and former RNC chief-of-staff Mike Shields.\n\nShields, president of the AAN, told Politico that the goal is an effective center-right agenda.\n\n\u201cWe believe in a center-right majority that is effective,\u201d Shields told Politico. \u201cWe\u2019ve elected a House and Senate, and we have an agenda in front of us in Congress \u2026 and our interest is to have that agenda be enacted and be effective.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Report: American Action Network Launching More Ads Supporting Centrist Republicans", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Report: American Action Network Launching More Ads Supporting Centrist Republicans", "title": "Report: American Action Network Launching More Ads Supporting Centrist Republicans - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/01/house-of-representatives-ap.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/04/06/report-american-action-network-launching-more-ads-supporting-centrist-republicans/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Report: American Action Network Launching More Ads Supporting Centrist Republicans", "title": "Report: American Action Network Launching More Ads Supporting Centrist Republicans - Breitbart", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/01/house-of-representatives-ap.jpg", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true", "app_id": 1243316582352556}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "American Action Network,Big Government,American Action Network", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Big Government", "tag": "American Action Network", "published_time": "2015-04-06T07:43:23-07:00", "categories": "Big Government"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdff17\"", "article_summary": "SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERPolitico reports that the American Action Network is poised to spend $1.8 million in 76 districts supporting Republicans who backed House leadership in recent budget and Medicare legislation.\n\u201cWe believe in a center-right majority that is effective,\u201d Shields told Politico.\nShields, president of the AAN, told Politico that the goal is an effective center-right agenda.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERA group aimed at bringing Congress more to the center is launching a new effort to support Republican House members who have bucked conservative pressure in favor of House leadership proposals.\nBut they aren\u2019t talking about Congresswoman Renee Ellmers,\u201d Politico quotes the narrator in an ad for the North Carolina Republican Ellmers."}
