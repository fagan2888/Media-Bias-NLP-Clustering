But don\u2019t expect to find viable hemp seeds or plants for sale.\n\nThe second annual NoCo Hemp Expo will take place at The Ranch Events Complex in Larimer County, where the sheriff is in the midst of a legal battle over the constitutionality of Amendment 64, the 2012 measure that made recreational marijuana \u2014 and hemp \u2014 legal in Colorado.\n\n\u201cHere in Colorado, hemp is 100 percent legal,\u201d said Morris Beegle, president of the Colorado Hemp Company and founder of the expo. \u201cWe\u2019ve got extensive regulations set up by the Colorado Department of Agriculture. Being able to grow, to plant, all that is 100 percent legal.\u201d\n\nHowever, under federal law, hemp has been banned for decades as a Schedule I controlled substance because of its association with marijuana. While both are cannabis plants, hemp contains less than 0.3 percent tetrahydrocannabinol, the psychoactive chemical that allows marijuana users to get high.\n\n\u201cYou can do virtually anything with hemp, except get stoned,\u201d Beegle said. \u201c(It can be used for) clothing, fabrics, biofuel and energy, food, building materials, medicine, paper. The list goes on and on.\u201d\n\nBetween Amendment 64 and additional legislation passed in 2014, Coloradans are now allowed to grow hemp for commercial, research and development purposes.\n\nAlso last year, federal legislation cleared the way for state departments and universities to begin growing the crop for research purposes in states that allow hemp production, including Colorado.\n\nBut Beegle said some law enforcement agencies are choosing to back the federal law prohibiting commercial production.\n\nAmong them is the Larimer County Sheriff\u2019s Office, which has jurisdiction over the Loveland events center. Beegle said that two weeks ago, law enforcement officers contacted the venue and said the event would be shut down if live plants or seeds were sold.\n\n\u201cTheir position is that you can\u2019t tell the difference between a hemp plant and a marijuana plant or a hemp seed and a marijuana seed,\u201d Beegle said. \u201cBut this is a hemp expo. You can get marijuana seeds anywhere throughout Colorado. Hemp seeds, on the other hand, are hard to come by. We\u2019ve got sellers that have a license to sell hemp seeds, and those people are being denied the right to do commerce.\u201d\n\nIn recent months, some Colorado legislators have expressed support for federal legislation to allow commercial hemp production, including U.S. Rep. Jared Polis and U.S. Sen. Cory Gardner. Polis will speak at Saturday\u2019s expo.\n\nAlso Saturday, the Colorado Hemp Company will release a report titled \u201cFirst Legal Harvest: Hemp Returns to Humanity.\u201d Beegle said the 28-page monograph will be printed on hemp paper.\n\nHe\u2019s expecting at least 1,000 people, compared with about 300 last year.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got people flying in from all over the country,\u201d Beegle said. \u201cThis is the largest hemp-specific gathering that\u2019s ever taken place in this country. \u2026 We\u2019re trying to educate the public, law enforcement, politicians, farmers \u2014 letting them know there\u2019s a viable crop they can start putting in the ground that\u2019s good for the community and good for the planet.\u201d\n\nNoco hemp expo\n\nThe event will take place Saturday from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. at The Ranch Events Complex in Loveland. Tickets are $20 at the door.
