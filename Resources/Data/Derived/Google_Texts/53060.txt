More than 800 people turned out for a 5K race Sunday to raise money to help an injured state trooper and her family.

The 5K for JK was held at the Maryland State Police Academy. The proceeds help Trooper Jacqueline Kline, who was badly injured when she was hit by a car last month during a traffic stop on Route 100.

Another trooper was administering field sobriety tests to a driver on the shoulder around 1 a.m. Oct. 6 when Kline stopped at the scene to provide backup.

Both troopers had their overhead lights activated, but as Kline walked toward the other trooper, she was struck by a Nissan, hitting the hood of the car. She was then propelled into the back of the State Police K-9 car, where she hit the back windshield and metal K-9 cage inside the car before landing in a ditch.

Kline sustained head injuries, a broken arm, cuts and contusions. She spent several weeks at the University of Maryland R Adams Cowley Shock Trauma Center, and is now in a rehab hospital.

Her mother, Amy Reed, says she expects her daughter to leave the hospital in about a week, but she'll continue physical therapy.

She says Kline is determined to return to work.

The crash sparked a boost in enforcement of the Move Over law, which requires drivers to switch lanes away from emergency vehicles. Despite the efforts, another trooper's car was destroyed during a traffic stop Oct. 12, and a third trooper was injured in a crash in late October while stopped.
