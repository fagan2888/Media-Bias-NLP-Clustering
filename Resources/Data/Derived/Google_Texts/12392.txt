North Carolina’s “food deserts” take center stage this afternoon as legislators hold their second meeting to discuss how to make healthy, fresh food more available in rural areas and in communities where transportation is a barrier.

Among those testifying is Demetrius Hunter, who runs Grocers on Wheels. Hunter is profiled in today’s News and Observer where he discusses how mobile produce markets may be one solution for low-income residents in Wake County.

Rep. Yvonne Holley is hoping these hearings build support for her proposal that would offer tax credits to businesses that open or expand operations that sell nutritious food in the state’s food deserts zones.

Do you live in one of these desert? To find out, check out the recent graphic (above) by the good folks at the NC Budget & Tax Center.

Also on the subject of food insecurity, visit PBS News Hour for an eye-opening photo essay: Picturing Hunger in America.

Finally, we have two additional infographics for you to digest today. First, Mother Jones explains why California’s drought is quickly becoming everyone’s problem. And we’ll leave you with this fascinating graphic from Yes! Magazine on Why Corporations Want Our Public Schools. (Click on either image below to see the full-size original.)
