Then the health care industry arrived. Texas Health Resources opened a hospital in 2010. Other emergency medicine centers opened to the south, east and directly across the street from Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital.\n\nNearby are imaging centers, orthopedic surgery practices, urgent care, a women\u2019s clinic, physician practice groups \u2013 a plethora of health care providers in every direction. You can see the same thing in Plano, Frisco and many other suburbs across Texas and across the country.\n\nDen Bishop, president of Holmes Murphy health consultants in Dallas, says FM 2499 is the epitome of irrational exuberance in health care. He sees shopping malls of medicine where a Blockbuster video store or a Wolf Camera once stood.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve said it since 2010, but I fear for hospitals,\u201d Bishop said. \u201cIf we don\u2019t get something to let some air out of the balloon, we may be in for a health care recession. It\u2019s irrational exuberance again. It happened with subprime mortgages, it toppled in the dot.com boom. I think the hospital side of it is the irrational exuberance in our economy today.\u201d\n\nHospital administrators say they\u2019re building because North Texas is booming with newcomers. But health care has long been associated with the irrational economic theory of the baseball nostalgia movie Field of Dreams: \u201cIf you build it, they will come.\u201d\n\nNew hospitals have a way of finding patients and filling beds. An aging population is going to play its part as baby boomers go into the time of their lives when hospital and other health care needs rise to the fore.\n\nThe 2010 Affordable Care Act is playing a role as well. Most states (though not Texas) took the federal financial aid in the law and expanded Medicaid to include millions more low-income Americans. Others of the uninsured gained health coverage through the law\u2019s tax subsidies for anyone making up to four times the federal poverty level.\n\nPeople given access to health care after years without it tend to use it. That\u2019s what BlueCross BlueShield of Texas says left it with a $400 million loss last year in its individual health care plans.\n\nBishop says the Affordable Care Act played a hand in the health care boom \u2013 but not the main role.\n\nThe law, and subsequent congressional budget stringency, put a cap on Medicare spending. The federal government has since seen five years of the lowest rate of increase in Medicare expenditures since the program began 50 years ago.\n\nHealth care spending by the private sector has meanwhile shot up, Bishop says. In 1997, hospital spending per patient by private payers equaled 113 percent of what Medicare spent. By 2012, private payers were spending 187 percent of what Medicare was paying for hospital care.\n\nThe health care industry calls this cost-shifting.\n\nWell before the law known as Obamacare, however, Bishop saw air filling the health care balloon.\n\nIn 1993, according to the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics, New York was the only state where the largest source of employment was health care and social assistance. In 2003, there were 10 states in that category. In 2013, health care was the biggest employer in 34 states \u2013 including Texas.\n\nBishop doesn\u2019t blame the hospital chains. His culprits are private employers who meekly paid yearly insurance cost increases far above the rate of inflation.\n\n\u201cI tell them, \u2018Shame on you for being willing to pay this,\u2019\u201d Bishop said. \u201c\u2018You haven\u2019t cared that you\u2019ve had 8 percent inflation [in health care]. You just absorbed some of it, and passed the rest to your employees.\u2019\u201d\n\nFollow Jim Landers on Twitter at @landersjim.\n\nThe Great American Healthcare Recession: FM 2499 in Flower Mound", "article_metadata": {"description": "Den Bishop, president of health consultants Holmes Murphy in Dallas, sees health care as an overbuilt sector of the economy that could lead us into a recession.", "og": {"description": "Den Bishop, president of health consultants Holmes Murphy in Dallas, sees health care as an overbuilt sector of the economy that could lead us into a recession.", "title": "Landers: Irrational exuberance in health care?", "url": "http://www.dallasnews.com/business/columnists/jim-landers/20150727-landers-irrational-exuberance-in-health-care.ece", "image": {"width": 345, "identifier": "http://www.dallasnews.com/resrsc/images/facebook-default.jpg", "height": 345}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "type": "article"}, "LastModifiedDate": "2015-07-28T02:34:22Z", "twitter": {"site": "@dallasnews", "card": "summary", "creator": "@dallasnews"}, "PublishDate": "2015-07-27T19:05:33Z", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Landers: Irrational exuberance in health care?\", \"link\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/business/columnists/jim-landers/20150727-landers-irrational-exuberance-in-health-care.ece\", \"image_url\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/resrsc/images/facebook-default.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"2375880\", \"pub_date\": \"2015-07-27T19:05:33Z\", \"section\": \"Jim Landers\", \"author\": \"Jim Landers\", \"tags\": [\"dallas\", \"dallas fort worth\", \"dallas news\", \"dallas fort worth news\", \"dfw news\", \"dallas local news\", \"dallas fort worth local news\", \"dallas newspaper\", \"dallas morning news\", \"dallas morning news newspaper\"]}", "fb": {"admins": 1043783589, "page_id": 20946638799, "app_id": 258290334265148}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"image": "http://www.dallasnews.com/resrsc/images/facebook-default.jpg", "publishtime": "2015-07-27T19:05:33Z"}}, "news_keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper"}, "article_summary": "Den Bishop, president of Holmes Murphy health consultants in Dallas, says FM 2499 is the epitome of irrational exuberance in health care.\nNearby are imaging centers, orthopedic surgery practices, urgent care, a women\u2019s clinic, physician practice groups \u2013 a plethora of health care providers in every direction.\nBishop says the Affordable Care Act played a hand in the health care boom \u2013 but not the main role.\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t get something to let some air out of the balloon, we may be in for a health care recession.\n\u201c\u2018You haven\u2019t cared that you\u2019ve had 8 percent inflation [in health care]."}
