What would first lady Michelle Obama say? On Wednesday, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., officially confirmed that she views ice cream as an anytime food, not a sometime food.

The Atlantic's Hanna Rosin asked Pelosi if it was true that she eats ice cream for breakfast.

"I have been known," Pelosi said. "I have said – and my grandchildren have overheard this, but I told them it's too late for me, you shouldn't do this – if I only had one food ... dark chocolate ice cream, morning, noon and night."

Speaking of her "grandma" status, Pelosi used it as an example of something people have forgotten about her because of all the negative political ads.

"Look, I had probably $100 million mischaracterizing who I am," Pelosi said at The Atlantic's Shriver Report event at the Newseum. "You'd never know that I was an Italian-American grandmother."

Her greater point was that more women don't run for office because they don't want to subject their families to similar scrutiny.

"If you reduce the role of money in politics and increase the level of civility in the debate, more women will run for office," Pelosi pointed out. "And that's a very wholesome thing."
