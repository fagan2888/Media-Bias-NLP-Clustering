And, after Obama was elected president and the Affordable Care Act was passed in 2010, many involved in the effort celebrated.\n\n\u201cIt was like, \u2018Oh, my God. Look what we\u2019ve done,\u2019\u201d said Beverly Strayhall, a former nurse from Davenport and an organizer in the effort, called Iowa for Health Care, an union initiative.\n\nNow, six years after passage of the health care law, there is a yet another simmering health care debate among the leading Democrats competing this year.\n\nClinton, in her second try for the presidency, proposes to build on the Affordable Care Act to tackle high costs, particularly drug prices.\n\nSanders instead proposes a \u201cMedicare for all\u201d plan, akin to a single-payer proposal.\n\nThe two have sparred over the breadth, impact and feasibility of their approaches.\n\nA week ago, the Clinton camp said Sanders hadn\u2019t described how he would pay for his health care plan, and that he would dismantle the Affordable Care Act and plunge the country into another divisive debate.\n\nSanders\u2019 campaign accused her of abandoning the ideal of universal care.\n\nAnd then Clinton took aim at the practicality of his plan.\n\n\u201cIn theory, there\u2019s a lot to like about some of his ideas,\u201d Clinton said Thursday in Indianola. \u201cBut in theory isn\u2019t enough. A president has to deliver in reality.\u201d\n\nSanders\u2019 camp argued that he\u2019s the only candidate who has put forward a plan to provide full coverage.\n\n\u201cEleven days before the Iowa caucuses, only one candidate in this race has detailed a plan to provide better health care for all Americans at less cost for middle-class families. It\u2019s not Secretary Clinton,\u201d Sanders\u2019 spokesman, Michael Briggs, said Thursday.\n\nA decade after the smock-wearing activists pushed candidates to commit to universal care \u2014 and signed up thousands of activists \u2014 much has happened.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act has covered millions more people and the rate of uninsured has declined. But millions remain uncovered and premiums and deductibles are higher in the exchanges than many would like.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no public option,\u201d Strayhall said, referring to a government-run insurance plan that had been in all the candidates\u2019 proposals but never made it into law.\n\nThere\u2019s not enough competition to bring down prices, she added. \u201cI don\u2019t really see that. I see the medical industry, they compete for bigger and better and more expensive equipment and procedures.\u201d And while that may be good for the patient, she said, it raises costs.\n\nHowever, Strayhall, a supporter of former Maryland Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley in the Democratic race, is skeptical about a Medicare-for-all plan. \u201cSingle payer would be great,\u201d she said, but added: \u201cWhat\u2019s to keep a party from getting into power that under funds it. Where would it be then?\u201d\n\nKaren Metcalf, another organizer from Bettendorf who plans to caucus for Sanders, takes a long view of the Affordable Care Act\u2019s deficiencies. \u201cI keep telling myself that 2010 was when the Affordable Care Act passed. It\u2019s only 2016 and we\u2019re still working on implementation.\u201d\n\nShe said she\u2019s comfortable with Clinton\u2019s approach, but doesn\u2019t choose between the two, saying she still has questions about Sanders\u2019 plan.\n\nMetcalf said Sanders has done the country a service. \u201cI\u2019m really grateful to Sen. Sanders for making sure people don\u2019t think health care is a dead issue. There\u2019s a long way to go to keep reminding people there\u2019s still 29 million people uninsured,\u201d she said.\n\nOn the ground, two unions representing nurses are on opposite sides.\n\nThe union that founded Iowa for Health Care, Service Employees International Union, has endorsed Clinton.\n\nCathy Glasson, president of SEIU Iowa, praises Clinton\u2019s work on health care through the years and praises the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cThe law is working. It\u2019s saving Iowans\u2019 lives,\u201d she said.\n\nGlasson shies away from comparing the two candidates\u2019 approaches. But she echoes the idea that the Affordable Care Act provides a foundation. \u201cIt\u2019s a work in progress, but it\u2019s a good work in progress.\u201d\n\nAnother nurses group is working its way across the state in a bus to campaign for Sanders. And Jean Ross, the national co-president of National Nurses United, said she\u2019s not satisfied.\n\n\u201cMany people feel we settled for what we\u2019ve got. If you look at the Affordable Care Act, it doesn\u2019t accomplish our goals,\u201d she said.\n\nRoss brushed aside the idea that a Medicare-for-all plan isn\u2019t politically feasible. \u201cThe impetus for starting any kind of solution should never be \u2018What can we afford? What do we think is politically practical?\u2019 It should start with, \u2018This is what people want. This is what people need. How do we achieve it?\u2019\u201d\n\nHealth care hasn\u2019t been as big a part of the 2016 campaign as it was in 2008. Income inequality, gun violence and racial relations are playing a bigger role.\n\nBut health care still is important to voters.\n\nFifteen percent of likely Democratic caucusgoers called it their most important issue, according to a Quinnipiac Poll this month.", "article_metadata": {"Description": "The Gazette | Nearly a decade ago, before the 2008 Iowa caucuses, it was unusual to go to a rally for Barack Obama or Hillary Clinton and not see someone in a purple smock.Ev", "og": {"url": "http://www.thegazette.com/subject/life/health/health-care/health-care-ideas-still-divide-democrats-20160125", "type": "article", "image": "http://www.thegazette.com/storyimage/GA/20160125/ARTICLE/160129799/AR/0/AR-160129799.jpg", "site_name": "The Gazette", "description": "Nearly a decade ago, before the 2008 Iowa caucuses, it was unusual to go to a rally for Barack Obama or Hillary Clinton and not see someone in a purple smock."}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thegazette.com/subject/life/health/health-care/health-care-ideas-still-divide-democrats-20160125", "title": "Health care ideas still divide Democrats", "description": "Nearly a decade ago, before the 2008 Iowa caucuses, it was unusual to go to a rally for Barack Obama or Hillary Clinton and not see someone in a purple smock.", "site": "@gazettedotcom"}, "MobileOptimized": 320, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "bt": {"title": "Health care ideas still divide Democrats", "type": "thegazette_", "pubDate": "2016-01-25T06:00:00-05:00", "modDate": "2016-01-24T19:57:00-05:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 163646090334606}, "apple-touch-fullscreen": "yes", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "Now, six years after passage of the health care law, there is a yet another simmering health care debate among the leading Democrats competing this year.\nEver present, the smock-wearing health care advocates, organized by a national union, pushed, prodded and questioned the candidates about their plans for universal health care.\nCathy Glasson, president of SEIU Iowa, praises Clinton\u2019s work on health care through the years and praises the Affordable Care Act.\nAnd, after Obama was elected president and the Affordable Care Act was passed in 2010, many involved in the effort celebrated.\nThe Affordable Care Act has covered millions more people and the rate of uninsured has declined."}
