But to get to a race against Ben\u00adnet, Fra\u00adzi\u00ader would first have to sur\u00advive a com\u00adpet\u00adit\u00adive primary, something Gard\u00adner didn\u2019t have to do.\n\nFra\u00adzi\u00ader said he is pro-Second Amend\u00adment rights but be\u00adlieves in the cur\u00adrent sys\u00adtem of fed\u00ader\u00adal back\u00adground checks for gun own\u00aders.

Ed Per\u00adlmut\u00adter in 2010, said he has met with the Na\u00adtion\u00adal Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adan Sen\u00adat\u00adori\u00adal Com\u00admit\u00adtee to dis\u00adcuss the race and spoken with some of Col\u00ador\u00adado\u2019s mem\u00adbers of Con\u00adgress, in\u00adclud\u00ading Gard\u00adner. Fra\u00adzi\u00ader briefly launched a cam\u00adpaign against Ben\u00adnet in 2009, but he ended it to pur\u00adsue the House seat in\u00adstead. Fra\u00adzi\u00ader said he was first ap\u00adproached about this race more than a year ago, but only began to give it ser\u00adi\u00adous con\u00adsid\u00ader\u00ada\u00adtion in the past two months, as some po\u00adten\u00adtial Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adan can\u00addid\u00adates dropped out.\n\nHis as\u00adsess\u00adment of the con\u00adtest reads like it came right out of the NR\u00adSC\u2019s play\u00adbook.\n\n\u201cA great ma\u00adjor\u00adity of the people in Col\u00ador\u00adado are not pleased with the dir\u00adec\u00adtion of our coun\u00adtry, and Sen. Mi\u00adchael Ben\u00adnet has had a lot to do with that,\u201d said Fra\u00adzi\u00ader. \u201cHe voted for Obama\u00adcare, which we now learned thou\u00adsands of Col\u00ador\u00adadoans are go\u00ading to be without in\u00adsur\u00adance with the clos\u00ading of the co-ops; he voted for the Ir\u00adan deal, which I be\u00adlieve is a bad deal for Amer\u00adica, a deal that was brokered with the biggest state spon\u00adsor of ter\u00adror\u00adism; and he\u2019s stood on the side\u00adlines as our eco\u00adnomy has limped along with lackluster job growth.\u201d\n\nCol\u00ador\u00adado is one of Sen\u00adate Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adans\u2019 few pickup op\u00adpor\u00adtun\u00adit\u00adies in 2016, as they already con\u00adtrol most of the Sen\u00adate seats up in the next elec\u00adtion. Giv\u00aden Gard\u00adner\u2019s suc\u00adcess in 2014, the GOP im\u00adme\u00addi\u00adately looked at Ben\u00adnet as a po\u00adten\u00adtially vul\u00adner\u00adable in\u00adcum\u00adbent in the next elec\u00adtion. But while the party has been look\u00ading for can\u00addid\u00adates, Ben\u00adnet has already amassed an in\u00adtim\u00adid\u00adat\u00ading $5.4 mil\u00adlion in cam\u00adpaign funds.\n\nStill, Fra\u00adzi\u00ader points to his ex\u00adper\u00adi\u00adence on the Au\u00adrora City Coun\u00adcil as proof he can break through where oth\u00ader Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adans may not. \u201cI rep\u00adres\u00aden\u00adted the third largest city in the state for eight years, the most di\u00adverse city in the state, a city that is urb\u00adan and sub\u00adurb\u00adan and leans Demo\u00adcrat\u00adic,\u201d said Fra\u00adzi\u00ader.\n\nCLA\u00adRI\u00adFIC\u00adA\u00adTION: The latest ver\u00adsion of this art\u00adicle makes clear that while Fra\u00adzi\u00ader sup\u00adports back\u00adground checks for gun pur\u00adchases, he does not want to ex\u00adpand them past what\u2019s already writ\u00adten in fed\u00ader\u00adal law.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "National Journal", "description": "Ryan Frazier, a former Aurora City Council member, is considering running against Sen.
