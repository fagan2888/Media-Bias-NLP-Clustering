It is a terrifying prospect. But with a stroke of a pen TDs, who have the luxury of sleeping in a warm bed at night, could help stricken families keep a roof over their heads.\n\nThey have to do something.\n\nHomeless crisis soars by 25%: Charity warns \u20ac500m needed to tackle issue\n\nA new study by the Economic and Social Research Institute shows that in the short-term the problem is going to get even worse.\n\nThe report says 54,000 new homes are needed over the next seven years in the Greater Dublin area to meet demand.\n\nAnd given the total number of housing completions is currently below what is required, it has warned there will be even further shortages if the rate of builds does not rise rapidly. There is also another\n\nmajor problem looming \u2013 that of accommodation for third-level students this coming term.\n\nWhile landlords were falling over themselves to attract students during the tough times of recent years, that is no longer the case.\n\nThe scramble for accommodation means students are now being priced out of the market and the bottom line is that many will struggle to find a bed in the capital next month that they can afford.\n\nSo where are they going to go? Dublin is home to 80,000 students and while some will be able to commute if need be, others don\u2019t have a choice because they live too far away.\n\nThe Government cannot continue to bury their heads in the sand and must work to find a solution.\n\nJust stop taking the pee fellas\n\nTwitter/AndrewMc1998 Fintan Goold relieves himself on the Croke Park pitch\n\nMost footballers playing at Croke Park dream of making the headlines the next day.\n\nBut Cork star Fintan Goold made them for all the wrong reasons after last Sunday\u2019s game against Mayo.\n\nWhat on earth was the player thinking when he decided to pull out his tackle and urinate on the hallowed turf at Croke Park with the world and its mother watching?\n\nOr did he just not think at all?\n\nPictures of the him peeing were broadcast around the world, giving viewers an unexpected and unwelcome eyeful.\n\nThere is a time and place for everything and relieving yourself on live TV is just not one of them.\n\nHopefully, the GAA will take measures to ensure it never happens again.\n\nPictured: GAA fans left shocked after Cork star Fintan Goold relieves himself on Croke Park pitch\n\nThe incident though is representative of a much wider issue regarding men and why they think it\u2019s alright to whip out their privates in a public place in broad daylight and take a pee.\n\nIt\u2019s not. But it\u2019s happening more and more, filling our streets with urine and a horrible, nasty stench.\n\nJust because men are able to do it doesn\u2019t mean they should.\n\nI\u2019ve seen fellas pee up against historical buildings, shops, and even a church just because they couldn\u2019t be bothered to find a toilet like the rest of us.\n\nSome aren\u2019t a bit discreet and do it even if there are kids nearby.\n\nThey should realise that urinating in a country field is a lot different to taking out your tackle on a public street or in the case of Fintan Goold on a football pitch on live television.\n\nScrumthing special to beat All Blacks\n\nWe haven\u2019t had much to cheer about sports-wise this year but the Irish women\u2019s rugby team changed all that on Tuesday night.\n\nTheir ground-breaking win against the All Blacks is what dreams are made of. Through pure grit, determination and hard work the ladies managed to get one over on their male counterparts by beating New Zealand \u2013 something the men\u2019s team have so far failed to do. It was a joy to watch.\n\nWomen's Rugby World Cup 2014: Niamh Briggs' penalty sees Ireland beat four-time champions New Zealand in Paris\n\nAnd it was lovely to see Ireland coach Joe Schmidt and star fly-half Johnny Sexton in the French stadium cheering them on.\n\nPerhaps now the 2013 Grand Slam champions will start to get the same level of coverage as the men. They deserve nothing less.", "article_metadata": {"description": "There is now a desperate lack of affordable, rented accommodation in the capital and other cities around \nthe country", "author": "Marie Kierans", "og": {"site_name": "irishmirror", "description": "There is now a desperate lack of affordable, rented accommodation in the capital and other cities around the country", "language": "en", "tags": "Homelessness, Joe Schmidt, The GAA, Cork, Croke Park", "url": "http://www.irishmirror.ie/news/news-opinion/homeless-crisis-must-be-solved-4031445", "section": "News Opinion", "title": "Homeless crisis must be solved", "type": "article", "image": "http://i4.irishmirror.ie/incoming/article4031459.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/I140809_130310_564251oTextCS_67033344.jpg"}, "twitter": {"site": "@irishmirror", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@mariekierans"}, "robots": "noarchive", "fb": {"page_id": 191236384249467, "app_id": 242595262543655, "pages": 191236384249467}, "article": {"published_time": "2014-08-10T10:15:18+01:00", "section": "News Opinion", "modified_time": "2014-08-10T10:15:18+01:00", "tag": "Croke Park", "expiration_time": "2014-09-09T10:15:18+01:00", "id": "irishmirror-4031445"}, "msvalidate.01": "17DA4C91A126705A8B1E2A5FD7CAC9EF", "google-site-verification": "XFTYcekdj8QhfbYzrE8xsF_dNkuLkuPdjS9HzCkEWRk", "news_keywords": "Homelessness,Joe Schmidt,The GAA,Cork,Croke Park"}, "article_summary": "But Cork star Fintan Goold made them for all the wrong reasons after last Sunday\u2019s game against Mayo.\nJust stop taking the pee fellasTwitter/AndrewMc1998 Fintan Goold relieves himself on the Croke Park pitchMost footballers playing at Croke Park dream of making the headlines the next day.\nHomeless crisis: One family losing their home in the capital every single dayThat and the chronic shortage of new houses being built in the Greater Dublin City area.\nThe revelation that one family in Dublin is being made homeless every day makes for grim reading.\nThe Government must meet the growing crisis head-on to ensure even more people don\u2019t end up living on the streets of our capital."}
