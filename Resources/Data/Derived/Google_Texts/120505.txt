Florida Department of Corrections Chief Julie Jones said Wednesday she plans to renegotiate or rebid the state's private health care contracts, the Palm Beach Post reports.

Jones said that talks with the contractors, Corizon Prison Health Management and Wexford Health Sources focus on better oversight of prescription drug delivery, mental health services, and an increasing the number of registered nurses on staff, according to the Post. If negotiations fall through, "Plan B" could include renewing in-house treatment for inmates, the Post reports.
