The Republicans are told what to say by the Koch brothers.\u201d\n\n\u201cSome nation is going to be the 21st Century superpower,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cSome say Germany, some say Russia and I say the United States. In my first term, I want to see a half-billion more solar panels built, and in my second term, enough energy being produced to power every home in this country.\u201d\n\nOn the economy, Clinton said if she is elected, she \u201cwould invest in communities that are left out and left behind.\u201d\n\nShe mentioned a program her husband, former President Bill Clinton created, New Market Tax Credits, and said while she was in South Carolina, she was told about a factory there that used the tax credits to create a number of new jobs.\n\n\u201cI want to invest more in small businesses,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cThat\u2019s important to young people, minorities and women who want to own their own small business.\u201d\n\nOn the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, Clinton said 19 million more people now have health care than they did before the legislation was adopted, and 90 percent of all American\u2019s now have health care.\n\n\u201cBefore Obamacare there was Hillarycare,\u201d Clinton said.\u201dIn the 90\u2019s, when Bill was president, we wanted to get a program where every American would be insured but we couldn\u2019t get it approved.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Republicans vote to repeal the Affordable Care Act,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cThey\u2019re voting to go back to where we were before. When you hear them say they\u2019re going to repeal the Affordable Care Act, ask they what they\u2019re going to replace it with.\u201d\n\nShe also said she was proud of Arkansas, and how former Gov. Mike Beebe and current Gov. Asa Hutchinson worked to accept the federal dollars and expand Medicaid.\n\n\u201cPeople have got health insurance and rural hospitals are not closing, unlike other states that didn\u2019t accept the money,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cThe people that complain the most about the Affordable Care Act are the ones with health insurance.\u201d\n\nWithout mentioning his name, Clinton took a shot at Trump when she talked about foreign policy, saying his comments about Muslims and Islam will make the job of the next president more difficult as they look for a way to deal with ISIS.\n\n\u201cYou have to build relationships, not insult people,\u201d she said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "PINE BLUFF \u2014 Fresh off her victory in South Carolina on Saturday, former Arkansas and U.S. first lady and former secretary of state Hillary Clinton brought her campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination to Pine Bluff on Sunday night.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Ray King Pine Bluff Commercial", "og": {"site_name": "Arkansas News", "description": "PINE BLUFF \u2014 Fresh off her victory in South Carolina on Saturday, former Arkansas and U.S. first lady and former secretary of state Hillary Clinton brought her campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination to Pine Bluff on Sunday night.", "title": "Hillary Clinton campaigns in Pine Bluff", "url": "http://arkansasnews.com/news/arkansas/hillary-clinton-campaigns-pine-bluff", "image": "http://arkansasnews.com/sites/arkansasnews.com/files/field/media/web1_hillary-clinton2_0.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://arkansasnews.com/news/arkansas/hillary-clinton-campaigns-pine-bluff", "image": {"src": "http://arkansasnews.com/sites/arkansasnews.com/files/field/media/web1_hillary-clinton2_0.jpg"}, "title": "Hillary Clinton campaigns in Pine Bluff", "card": "summary", "creator": "@arkansasnews"}, "keywords": "Arkansas,News,", "article": {"published_time": "2016-02-28T21:02:39-06:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=0.9"}, "article_summary": "PINE BLUFF \u2014 Fresh off her victory in South Carolina on Saturday, former Arkansas and U.S. first lady and former secretary of state Hillary Clinton brought her campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination to Pine Bluff on Sunday night.\nOn climate change, Clinton said the Republican candidates all say they don\u2019t know enough about the subject because they\u2019re not scientists.\n\u201cBefore Obamacare there was Hillarycare,\u201d Clinton said.\u201dIn the 90\u2019s, when Bill was president, we wanted to get a program where every American would be insured but we couldn\u2019t get it approved.\u201d\u201cThe Republicans vote to repeal the Affordable Care Act,\u201d Clinton said.\n\u201cPeople have got health insurance and rural hospitals are not closing, unlike other states that didn\u2019t accept the money,\u201d Clinton said.\nThe Republicans are told what to say by the Koch brothers.\u201d\u201cSome nation is going to be the 21st Century superpower,\u201d Clinton said."}
