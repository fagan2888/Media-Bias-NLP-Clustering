You are managing a new innovation, with billions at stake and a deadline looming. But people with their noses in the details are telling you that you can forget about getting it done on time.

Your gut tells you to push past the naysayers, rally the troops and do the impossible. But what if the naysayers are right?

The recent troubles with the rollout of the Affordable Care Act, which has put Kathleen Sebelius, U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services, and others on the hot seat, have brought this classic management dilemma into focus.

Leadership and management experts seem to agree that success in this situation – the ability to know when problems are real and deadlines and quality are in jeopardy – depends on a culture that expects results but demands the truth.

“You need to have a management team that’s comfortable with exposing problems as soon as they become aware of them,” said Patrick Magoon, CEO and president of the Ann & Robert H. Lurie Children’s Hospital of Chicago.

Magoon knows big projects. He oversaw the construction of the hospital’s $855 million new home, completed on time and under budget last year.

“Everybody knows there are going to be problems,” he said. “There are going to be issues. It all comes out in the wash sooner or later. How you handle that first problem is important, because it sets the tone.”

Leonard Gingerella, clinical professor of entrepreneurship at Loyola University Chicago’s Quinlan School of Business, said it’s important to establish expectations and benchmarks ahead of time.

"If you start with a lie, you're going to end with a lie," he said. "You have to insist on really strong performance criteria."

Walter Scott, professor of management at Northwestern University’s Kellogg School of Management, said managing private contractors, who are doing much of the work on the Affordable Care Act rollout, also demands clear benchmarks and expectations.

“You are going to get what you ask for.” he said.

Let workers speak frankly, he added.

“Most organizations don’t do enough to protect naysayers, because naysayers make people uncomfortable,” Scott said. “You’ve got to protect them, to honor them. You thank them for their input even if you don’t agree with them.”

James B. Schein, clinical professor of management and strategy at Kellogg and author of “Reversing the Slide: A Strategic Guide to Turnarounds and Corporate Renewal,” said managers must be aware of naysayers who are impediments rather than contributors. They’re easy to spot, he said. They “just keep bad-mouthing the strategy itself.”

Magoon said leaders can counter this by “setting expectations that people will work with facts of what they know, and not innuendo.”

“Identifying the problem is step one,” he said. “Helping develop a solution is step two. That’s the fun part of any job.”

Schein said leaders must also be ready to step away from preset deadlines and objectives, focusing on the long-term goal of quality and success.

“You may say: ‘Take that hill,’” he said. “But you’ve got to be willing to step back as you’re headed there and say, ‘Oops. Wrong hill!’”

Magoon said that while the Lurie Children’s project was finished on time, he always emphasized quality over punctuality.

“Nobody is going to remember if you’re not on time, as long as you get it right,” he said. “But if you get it wrong, everybody will remember.”
