(Bob Self/AP)\n\nAbout 1,500 nurses squeezed into the hotel ballroom to give Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius a standing ovation before she\u2019d even said hello. \u201cThis is so exciting!\u201d whispered a nursing teacher from Grand Rapids, Mich.\n\nThere was extravagant applause when Sebelius said that some members of Congress consider defunding the Affordable Care Act \u201cthe only thing they\u2019d like to do for the next three years of their lives.\u201d There was more of the same when she added, \u201cBut here\u2019s the real deal: This is the law.\u201d\n\nAnyone at that microphone would have been feeling the love by then \u2014 and thinking she was among allies. Sebelius told the almost all-female crowd at the Wednesday afternoon kickoff of the National League for Nursing convention in Washington that they were highly \u201cinformed validators\u201d of the law Nancy Pelosi pushed up Capitol Hill three years ago and the Supreme Court declared constitutional last summer.\n\n\u201cWho better than you,\u2019\u2019 Sebelius asked rhetorically, to help explain the law ahead of Oct. 1, when Americans in every state and the District will start signing up for the health-insurance exchanges? Who better to talk up the program, biggest new social program in decades,as Hill Republicans throw themselves onto the tracks in front of the ACA train, even if it means shutting down the government?\n\nAlas, Madam Secretary, some of those standing and clapping were just being polite. In conversations before and after your \u201cLet\u2019s go get \u2019em\u201d talk, the health-care professionals at the Marriott Wardman Park were as divided as the rest of us. And just as confused about how 16 million previously uninsured will enroll, and what that will change.\n\nTheir objections aren\u2019t partisan or ideological. No one mentioned abortion, worried about expanding the role of government or voiced concern that Americans could get \u201chooked\u201d on a new entitlement.\n\nTheir concerns are specific and practical.\n\nSister Marie Buckley, who teaches nursing in Rockland County, north of New York City, doubts that penalties for opting out of coverage are harsh enough to nudge young, healthy people to sign up. The system is designed to have their premiums help offset the cost of care for those baby boomers who were sure they\u2019d never get old or sick. She worries: Won\u2019t a lot of younger folks figure, \u201cIf the fine is only $95, why pay\u201d more than that for coverage that invincible me doesn\u2019t need?\n\n\u201cHospitals are really struggling as it is,\u2019\u2019 adds her friend Kathleen Hopkins. She sees the law as \u201ca nightmare, because reimbursement is tied to a black-and-white standard\u201d that harshly penalizes even \u201cone little mistake\u201d and could put some out of business.\n\nMandy Millet, dean of nursing at Northern Virginia Community College, was put off by her experience with the system in England, where she was born and where her mother died last fall: \u201cMy mom fell in the hospital and hit her head, and they said, \u2018We can\u2019t treat her for that,\u2019 because she was there for outpatient cancer treatment. They wouldn\u2019t give her an ice pack or let her lie down.\u201d\n\nYes, she knows that the American system will remain primarily private and that the uninsured need care. While the \u201cconcept\u2019s good, the reality might be very different,\u201d she said.And will new standards keep nurses from providing the care and compassion that have always been at the heart of their mission?\n\nThere were also some strong advocates in the crowd: \u201cIt\u2019s a misconception that this is for people who don\u2019t work,\u2019\u2019 said Carmen Stokes, who described herself as \u201can old ER nurse\u201d at Detroit\u2019s Sinai Grace. She\u2019s seen the uninsured and underinsured come in far too late, at far greater expense. \u201cI get tired of people calling it Obamacare,\u2019\u2019 she said, when it\u2019s about improving access and accountability.\n\nWhat the staunchest supporters love \u2014 the law\u2019s emphasis on a common good \u2014 might be exactly what worries the critics. Whose good matters more? Once, insurers viewed reconstruction after breast cancer as cosmetic and didn\u2019t cover it. Maybe those days should come back, said Kathleen Poindexter of Lansing, Mich. Americans \u201cthink we always have to have the best,\u201d she said, but \u201cpeople have to understand that this is a paradigm shift.\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe you\u2019re walking around and you\u2019re able to work; you\u2019re fine\u2019\u2019 after breast cancer, added Patricia Empie of Grand Rapids, and don\u2019t really need reconstruction that costs a sum with which \u201cI can give immunizations to thousands.\u201d\n\nMost of the conventioneer skeptics interviewed hope to be proven wrong, they volunteered. Maybe glitches can be fixed.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not clear what we\u2019re supposed to do,\u2019\u2019 said Rachel Bertiz, who works in a hospital and teaches nursing at Montgomery County Community College. She sees chaos, questions and a switch to electronic medical records that\u2019s going awfully slowly.\n\nIf someone spelled out exactly how nurses are supposed to be on the forefront of change, she\u2019d be there. \u201cEvery day I see people without insurance,\u201d she said. \u201cAs a nurse and someone who pays taxes, that worries me\u201d too.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "obamacare, health care act, sign-up period begins, kathleen sebelius", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius didn\u2019t seem to be getting ahead of herself when she addresses a nursing convention.", "title": "Nurses express practical concerns about health-care law", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/nurses-express-practical-concerns-about-health-care-law/2013/09/19/8781b734-2123-11e3-b73c-aab60bf735d0_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2013/09/20/National-Politics/Images/Sebelius_Talks_Obamacare-0caa4.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/nurses-express-practical-concerns-about-health-care-law/2013/09/19/8781b734-2123-11e3-b73c-aab60bf735d0_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "obamacare, health care act, sign-up period begins, kathleen sebelius", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost"}, "eomportal-uuid": "8781b734-2123-11e3-b73c-aab60bf735d0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "description": "Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius didn\u2019t seem to be getting ahead of herself when she addresses a nursing convention."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdbad4\"", "article_summary": "(Bob Self/AP)About 1,500 nurses squeezed into the hotel ballroom to give Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius a standing ovation before she\u2019d even said hello.\nIf someone spelled out exactly how nurses are supposed to be on the forefront of change, she\u2019d be there.\nHealth and Human Services secretary Kathleen Sebelius addressed local health care providers and community leaders on details of the soon to be implemented Affordable Care Act during a visit to Jacksonville, Florida's Sulzbacher Center on Sept. 16.\nAnd just as confused about how 16 million previously uninsured will enroll, and what that will change.\nWhat the staunchest supporters love \u2014 the law\u2019s emphasis on a common good \u2014 might be exactly what worries the critics."}
