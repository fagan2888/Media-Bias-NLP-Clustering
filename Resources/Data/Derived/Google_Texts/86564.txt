I read a letter and an article recently concerning the agenda of Rep. Chris Smith (R-4th Dist.) as reported in the newspaper. I admit it made me smile.

Rep. Smith writes feel-good newsletters in which there is no mention of women's health rights or human rights for fellow LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender) individuals.

Rep. Smith is one of our Congress members who waste our time and tax dollars trying to pass legislation to repeal the Affordable Care Act (56 times) to take away the health benefits of millions of people and to stop the president's executive order on immigration and the rollback of Roe vs. Wade and other women's health issues.

We just learned of the behavior of our state leader, Gov. Chris Christie, as was discussed in the editorial "Christie exploits executive order on taking gifts" (Feb. 6), and there's Bridgegate, Hurricane Sandy funding , potential prosecutorial interference by the administration and who knows what else we'll learn.

Then a letter writer wants us to "Find the will to remove teachers who behave badly" (Feb. 4). I am not sure we have all the "facts" on this one. We may have only heard from the district. There is a process that educators go through prior to being dismissed from their jobs, just like there is one for governors. It is called due process.

Rep. Smith got to be a congressman for 33 years. Christie was re-elected. Let's not pull an Arthur Miller "Crucible" here, people; however, with the facts we have about the people we elect, let's all remember them on Election Day.
