Burwell presented their arguments to the justices. Many young women students loudly and visibly demanded access to contraceptives as their reproductive right. Opposing them were nuns with huge signs denying those human rights under the sanctimonious guise of \u201creligious liberty.\u201d\n\nZubik v. Burwell\u2019s lead plaintiff is Little Sisters of the Poor, a nonprofit nursing home run by nuns. It is the second case heard by the Supreme Court opposing the requirement that all employer-provided health plans provide birth control at no extra cost under the Affordable Care Act. It\u2019s the fourth case opposing the ACA. Nine separate cases representing nonprofit affiliates of religious organizations \u2014 colleges, universities, hospitals and such \u2014 heard by nine appeals courts, were combined in this case.\n\nIn 2014, the first case against the ACA\u2019s contraceptive mandate, brought by family-owned Hobby Lobby, set a precedent when the court ruled 5-4 that closely held private businesses could refuse insurance coverage of contraceptives they viewed as causing abortions (but which don\u2019t do that, according to the medical profession) under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993.\n\nThe Zubik case contends that nonprofit businesses affiliated with religious institutions should receive the same contraception exemption as churches, temples and mosques and not be required to sign an opt-out form stating their religious opposition under the RFRA. They insist that filling out such a form makes them \u201ccomplicit\u201d in the \u201csin\u201d of providing birth control \u2014 because it allows students and workers, who may or may not observe the religion, to obtain contraception.\n\nHowever, according to the RFRA, all religious beliefs must not \u201csignificantly impinge on the interests of third parties.\u201d\n\nWho is more \u2018burdened\u2019?\n\nBoth Justice Samuel Alito and Chief Justice John Roberts asked questions exposing their ignorance of how the ACA insurance system works. They suggested that women get separate policies to cover contraceptives. The three women justices and U.S. Solicitor General Donal B. Verrilli Jr., representing the Obama administration, explained that making women get two sets of insurance was illegal and wouldn\u2019t work.\n\nMother Jones summarized: \u201cVerrilli explained that overwhelming evidence shows that even small cost barriers to contraception keep women from using it, which in turn results in more unplanned pregnancies and abortions. Congress wanted women to be able to get contraception seamlessly, from their regular doctors and through their regular health insurance plans.\u201d (March 24)\n\n\u201cThere has to be an accommodation, and that\u2019s what the government tried to do,\u201d said Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. (Nation, March 24)\n\nTo pose the question of whose rights would be more burdened \u2014 hundreds of nonprofit administrators who are allegedly morally offended while filling out forms once a year or thousands of women forced to make continual end-runs to get costly contraceptives? \u2014 makes the answer obvious.\n\nDeep divisions among justices\n\nThe hearing exposed deep divisions among the justices. Four progressives faced off against four conservatives, including Justice Anthony M. Kennedy who occasionally joins the progressives. He sided with the conservatives in Hobby Lobby, though he wrote a separate concordance strictly limiting the ruling.\n\nDuring the hearing, Kennedy flip-flopped, supporting the nuns\u2019 argument at one point, while articulating the main contradiction at another: \u201cIt\u2019s going to be very difficult for this court to write an opinion which says that once you have a church organization\u201d entitled to an exemption, \u201cyou have to treat a religious university the same. I just find that very difficult to write.\u201d (New York Times, March 23)\n\nAs in the Texas case the court heard on March 2 (see March 8 article in Workers World), Kennedy\u2019s vote is critical. However, it is profoundly undemocratic that one justice\u2019s decision would affect thousands of women.\n\nThree scenarios are possible. First, if the court vote is deadlocked at 4-4, the rulings of nine appeals courts will stand. Eight voted against the nonprofits, allowing coverage, and one voted to uphold the RFRA claim, so students and workers in seven Midwestern states would not have coverage. But the tie would not set a precedent, so the case could be reopened with nine justices. However, many articles noted, if Kennedy joins the other three conservatives in a tie, that would contradict his Hobby Lobby decision \u2014 necessitating another court case.\n\nSecond, the court could vote to delay resolution of the case until a ninth justice is seated. Third, if Kennedy votes with the progressive justices for a 5-3 decision, students and workers will be able to access contraceptives through their insurance.\n\n\u2018Historical Racism Matters\u2019 in this case\n\nThis case exposes deep divisions rooted in capitalist class society: centuries-old misogyny, racism and anti-poor bias. As Kira Shepherd points out in her must-read essay posted March 25 on Rewire (formerly RH Reality Check), \u201cThe Context of Historical Racism Matters in the Birth Control Benefits Case\u201d:\n\n\u201cEven as unintended pregnancy rates have declined in recent years, racial and economic disparities have persisted. Moreover, historical racism in the health-care system has contributed to higher rates of maternal mortality among women of color compared to white women, which combined with other poor health outcomes have had an impact on the psychological, economic, and social vitality of these communities. If the plaintiffs in Zubik are successful, it could open up the door for many other nonprofit entities and for-profit businesses to opt out of providing contraceptive insurance coverage on which women of color depend.\u201d\n\nShepherd concludes: \u201cContraception and counseling can help right some of the wrongs done to women of color in the area of reproductive justice and liberty. The Affordable Care Act contraceptive mandate takes us one step closer to such justice. It would be a grave injustice for the Supreme Court to allow the plaintiffs in the Zubik case \u2014 and others who might follow in their wake \u2014 to take us one step back.\u201d\n\nKathy Durkin contributed to this article.
