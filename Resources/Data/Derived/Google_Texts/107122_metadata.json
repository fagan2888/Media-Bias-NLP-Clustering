It's the first such ceremony for the program, which was started in 2014 and will graduate its first class in 2016.\n\n\u201cThis is the rite of passage for medical professionals,\u201d said Kelli Huesman, director of clinical education for the University\u2019s physician assistant department. \u201cIt signifies that they are moving on to do what they are trained to do.\u201d\n\nThe ceremony will also be significant for the master\u2019s degree program, which is preparing to admit its third cohort of students in August. More than 900 people have already applied for the 40 seats available. The application deadline is Dec. 1.\n\n\u201cThe inaugural white coat ceremony is an important milestone of progress for the PA program,\u201d said Kevin Kelly, dean of the School of Education and Health Sciences. \u201cWhen these students graduate in a year, they will be serving the medical needs of the Miami Valley and Ohio. The PA program is a new manifestation of UD's traditional mission to serve community and the greater social good.\"\n\nThe University of Dayton created the Master of Physician Assistant Practice program to help meet the demand for more health care professionals created in part by the Affordable Care Act.

They will work in the Dayton area, at the Cleveland Clinic or with Cincinnati-area hospitals.\n\nTheir white coats are being made by Prime Medical Apparel, owned by University of Dayton alumnus Jim Sampey. The coats are antimicrobial, designed to stop contamination between patients.\n\nThe students are writing their oath to reflect the program\u2019s mission to produce physician assistants who are committed to the service of the human person through the skillful, compassionate, and ethical provision of health care within the context of the Catholic Marianist tradition.\n\nFor more information, contact Meagan Pant, assistant director of media relations, at 937-229-3256 or mpant1@udayton.edu.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": {"secure_url": "https://udayton.edu/0/img/default-facebook-sharing-img.jpg", "identifier": "https://udayton.edu/0/img/default-facebook-sharing-img.jpg"}}, "ud-page-id": "aaa45b720a480e99747bc0aaed52895d", "ROBOTS": "INDEX,FOLLOW", "viewport": "width=device-width", "googlebot": "INDEX,FOLLOW"}, "article_summary": "A Rite of PassageThe University of Dayton will host a white coat ceremony for its first cohort of physician assistant students, marking their transition into clinical training.\n\u201cThis is the rite of passage for medical professionals,\u201d said Kelli Huesman, director of clinical education for the University\u2019s physician assistant department.\n\u201cThere are just not enough physicians to cover the influx of millions of people who now have access to health care,\u201d Huesman said.\nThe University of Dayton created the Master of Physician Assistant Practice program to help meet the demand for more health care professionals created in part by the Affordable Care Act.\n\u201cThe inaugural white coat ceremony is an important milestone of progress for the PA program,\u201d said Kevin Kelly, dean of the School of Education and Health Sciences."}
