By overriding Congress, Obama has shown nothing but contempt for the will of the people\u2013executive amnesty, unilateral action on Cuba and ObamaCare\u2013but John Boehner shows Obama the respect that should be reserved for the Patriots who opposed him and \u201cwe the people,\u201d whom they represent.\n\nPerhaps most shocking is the absence of a single California Congressman on that list of 25. After all, Obama\u2019s executive amnesty will affect California more than any other state, and California is reeling from the impact of decades of unchecked illegal immigration encouraged by a legislature controlled by Marxist progressives.\n\nNot only can illegal aliens now obtain driver\u2019s licenses in California, but because we have so many illegals who have chosen to make California their home, we have \u201cseparate but supposedly equal\u201d Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) offices set up to handle \u201cillegals only.\u201d\n\nIf Obama thinks he can easily process the estimated 5 million who qualify for for his executive amnesty, he ought to visit one of these \u201cillegals only\u201d DMV\u2019s, where 90% reportedly failed to pass the written test at first. If you cannot pass the written test, that does not bode well for you being a \u201csafe driver\u201d out on the road\u2013but then again this was always about politics for the Democrats, not public safety.\n\nSo, back to my question: Where are the California Representatives who will stand up for Californians against a man like Boehner, who only cares about currying favor for himself, everyone else be damned?\n\nOne reliable conservative, Tom McClintock, put out a statement yesterday defending his vote. The only problem with his rather defensive statement is that it\u2019s all about insider baseball, not the concerns of the voters, who put him back in power to combat Obama\u2019s agenda.\n\nBy decrying that the process should have taken place in the Republican caucus back in November, McClintock ignores the fact that public opinion takes time to build. It wasn\u2019t apparent that Boehner was going to enable Obama to the extent he did until he helped Obama push the \u201cCromnibus\u201d through, funding Obama\u2019s agenda without a fight, and outraging conservatives across the country. That was mid-December, long after the internal procedural moment had passed.\n\nYesterday\u2019s vote was about heeding the unmitigated anger of Republicans all over the country who worked hard to elect conservatives, only to have the GOP leadership ignore them\u2013and, worse, enable rather than oppose Obama. The fact that Congressmen Darrel Issa, Ed Royce, Dana Rohrbacker, all men you could rely on to do the right thing, didn\u2019t, is deeply troubling. Maybe they\u2019ve been in office too long, and have forgotten that they serve at our consent, not the Speaker\u2019s. They\u2019ll have to answer to their constituents for their vote.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Godspeed to the 25 Who Refused to Vote for Obama's Enabler", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Godspeed to the 25 Who Refused to Vote for Obama's Enabler", "title": "Godspeed to the 25 Who Refused to Vote for Obama's Enabler - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/01/AP126326621549.jpg", "height": 480}, "updated_time": "2015-01-07T11:26:22-07:00", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/01/07/godspeed-to-the-25-who-refused-to-vote-for-obamas-enabler/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Godspeed to the 25 Who Refused to Vote for Obama's Enabler", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/01/AP126326621549.jpg", "title": "Godspeed to the 25 Who Refused to Vote for Obama's Enabler - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "boehner, boehner vote, California Republicans, speaker of the house, Speaker Vote, U.S. Congress,Big Government, Breitbart California,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "published_time": "2015-01-07T10:49:03-07:00", "section": "Big Government", "modified_time": "2015-01-07T11:26:22-07:00", "tag": "U.S. Congress", "categories": "Big Government,Breitbart California"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "Obama\u2019s executive orders have increased, not decreased, since the 2014 midterm elections.\nAfter all, Obama\u2019s executive amnesty will affect California more than any other state, and California is reeling from the impact of decades of unchecked illegal immigration encouraged by a legislature controlled by Marxist progressives.\nPerhaps most shocking is the absence of a single California Congressman on that list of 25.\nIf you cannot pass the written test, that does not bode well for you being a \u201csafe driver\u201d out on the road\u2013but then again this was always about politics for the Democrats, not public safety.\nMaybe they\u2019ve been in office too long, and have forgotten that they serve at our consent, not the Speaker\u2019s."}
