However, occupancy rates have remained as one of the top challenges for executives, according to Cleary Gull\u2019s annual survey. Despite occupancy rates reaching above the 90th percentile for the industry, there is still room for improvement, says Backus.\n\n\u201cIt really comes down to each individual organization\u2019s business model,\u201d Backus tells SHN. \u201cSome that are really reliant on entrance fees and that model, they really need to be closer to 95% occupancy. Whereas if you have a rental, maybe you\u2019re not as reliant on that large entrance fee payment to come in to help operations.\u201d\n\nIn an effort to not only increase margins through higher occupancy rates, some senior living organizations are branching out into new service lines, including home health.\n\n\u201cHome health care\u2014where they are actually going outside of brick and mortar and providing services to those that aren\u2019t yet in the community\u2014may actually replace some of the needs for higher occupancy rates because you\u2019ve got another revenue stream and another service line to help offset that,\u201d says Backus. \u201cI would imagine that a lot of organizations would start reaching outside of their brick and mortar to really use that as a marketing tool and a way to help the community.\u201d\n\nAnother important change among executives is a shift in investment strategies and policies, says Backus. A majority of organizations\u201472%\u2014reported having strategic plans in place, according to the survey, which compiled responses from CEOs, CFOs and COOs of not-for-profit senior living organizations.\n\n\u201cBecause there are some uncertainties out there, organizations have had to take the information that they have right now, whether it\u2019s the level of reimbursement of Medicaid or Medicare, and start planning strategically around that but still keep the flexibility should things change down the road,\u201d says Backus.\n\nIn a changing environment with some uncertainty regarding new regulations and tougher economic conditions through rising interest rates, senior living organizations are not waiting around to make changes, says Backus. Hence, the high number of organizations that are moving forward with strategic plans to update facilities and make other changes.\n\n\u201cA lot of organizations have come to the conclusion that they need to just move forward on the information that they have on hand right now and either renovate, reposition or change some of their service lines,\u201d Backus tells SHN. \u201cI would anticipate the number will slowly move back down as organizations have fully implemented those plans.\u201d\n\nInvestment Headwinds and Diverging Strategies\n\nOne of the biggest changes among executives is that more are taking a harder look at investment policies, according to Backus.\n\n\u201cWhen we first started the survey, we had a good number of organizations that hadn\u2019t even reviewed their investment policy within 10 years,\u201d he says. \u201cNow, at least 60% of the organizations viewed it within the last year. The furthest out that it\u2019s gone is maybe five years.\u201d\n\nWith more volatility in the marketplace and rising interest rates, remaining competitive means senior living companies must be vigilant with their strategies.\n\n\u201cIt comes down to organizations knowing that they have to be more strategic with their investment portfolio,\u201d says Backus. \u201cIn the past, it used to be a separate silo that sat on the back burner\u2026They need to rely on those assets a little bit more now, and therefore there\u2019s a lot more attention being placed on how those assets are allocated and how frequently they are being looked at. It\u2019s more necessity based.\u201d\n\nThe scrutiny on strategies has resulted in some minor changes across investment trends, the survey found. For the first time in two years, companies were allocating more to fixed income and cash, with lower allocation to equities.\n\n\u201cThis is the first year where we actually saw an increase in the percent that\u2019s allocated to fixed income investments,\u201d says Backus. \u201cOrganizations are revisiting how their assets are allocated and being a little bit more strategic. But, it also shows the concerns that investors are sharing\u2014equities are extremely volatile and will continue to be volatile.\u201d\n\nWith the direction of interest rates up in the air for most of year and strong equity returns in 2014, the survey originally predicted the opposite trend. Indeed, fewer executives anticipated returns higher than 6% compared to the previous year. Backus says this new allocation trend is likely to remain as interest rates continue to edge higher over the next few years.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t anticipate a large change either in or out of the fixed income market,\u201d Backus predicts. \u201cOur recommendation is that there\u2019s always a place for fixed income investments in your investment portfolio. It\u2019s just how you allocated and diversify those fixed income assets is what\u2019s really going to help in a rising or a falling interest rate environment. Even though interest rates are slated to increase over the next several years, I don\u2019t see any drastic movement in or out of fixed income from an average allocation standpoint.\u201d\n\nAnother critical point of concern that could upset the industry is the upcoming presidential election, as changes made to the health care industry over the last several years are still hotly contested.\n\n\u201cThe upcoming election next year still leaves a lot of uncertainty out there,\u201d says Backus. \u201cIf the office turns over and you get a Republican in there versus a Democrat, they could try to unwind everything and all the changes that have been implemented up to this point, especially around the Affordable Care Act. That certainly may have an impact.\u201d\n\nWritten by Amy Baxter", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "cleary gull, business, finance, real estate, senior housing", "og": {"site_name": "Senior Housing News", "description": "Despite higher occupancy rates and steady returns reported in the industry, senior housing executives are still on the lookout to increase margins in new ways.
