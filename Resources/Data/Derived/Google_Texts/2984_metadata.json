His ridiculous claim we tried to exclude him from \u201csecret meetings\u201d is belied by his own past reporting.\n\nI e-mailed Meyer, asking what he meant by \u201csecret meetings.\u201d He sent me a Nov. 12, 2010, article about a board retreat written before the retreat occurred. Some secret.\n\nIt gets better. In Meyer\u2019s Denver Post story about a \u201csecret meeting,\u201d he wrote: \u201cDouglas County School District officials say an unexpected level of interest in a retreat exploring school choice \u2026 is forcing them to add an overflow room and a video feed to allow the public to watch the discussion.\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s review the bidding. Meyer is complaining about being excluded from a \u201csecret meeting\u201d (i) about which he wrote before it occurred and (ii) that was so widely publicized it required an overflow room to accommodate the public and the press. Not since Maxwell Smart deployed the \u201cCone of Silence\u201d has a secret been so loudly broadcast.\n\nThere is one kernel of accuracy amid the cacophony of Meyer\u2019s truthiness. Meyer did bitterly complain about his seat location in the meeting. We accommodated him. We have no record any \u201cmedia attorneys\u201d were involved in negotiating such weighty matters of public policy as a news reporter\u2019s seating preference.\n\nMeyer also claims a district spokeswoman urged him to delay some unspecified story. That\u2019s news to us. But Meyer\u2019s readers might want to know that that spokeswoman later left the district and stood as a union-backed board candidate in the next election. Gee, I wonder why she would do something truly secretive and contrary to the board\u2019s interests.\n\nFinally, Meyer\u2019s claim the board avoided the media is only partially true. We avoided him. We did so for reasons now evident in his column. He wasn\u2019t a fair reporter. He was biased.\n\nIf there\u2019s a scandal exposed by Meyer\u2019s column, that\u2019s it.\n\nDoug Benevento is vice president of the Douglas County School District\u2019s Board of Education.\n\nTo send a letter to the editor about this article, submit online or check out our guidelines for how to submit by e-mail or mail.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Guest Commentary: Column unfair to Dougco board", "title": "Guest Commentary: Column unfair to Dougco board", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/07/10/guest-commentary-column-unfair-to-dougco-board/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150710__20150712_Z00_OP12G_BENEVENTOp1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150710__20150712_Z00_OP12G_BENEVENTOp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-07-10T13:08:29+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-22T16:18:48+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdcd32\"", "article_summary": "Jeremy Meyer\u2019s longstanding animus against the Douglas County School Board jumped the shark in this column.\nI e-mailed Meyer, asking what he meant by \u201csecret meetings.\u201d He sent me a Nov. 12, 2010, article about a board retreat written before the retreat occurred.\nDoug Benevento is vice president of the Douglas County School District\u2019s Board of Education.\nBut Meyer\u2019s readers might want to know that that spokeswoman later left the district and stood as a union-backed board candidate in the next election.\nHis ridiculous claim we tried to exclude him from \u201csecret meetings\u201d is belied by his own past reporting."}
