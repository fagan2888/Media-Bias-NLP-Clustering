Photo: Rob Shakespeare\n\nIt's one of the most intriguing, colourful and imposing attractions of the 2014 Brisbane Festival.\n\nBut at its core, Exxopolis is nothing but air.\n\nExxopolis, a creation of the Nottingham-based Architects of Air, will be a feature of the South Bank cultural forecourt for the duration of the Brisbane Festival.\n\nExxopolis at South Bank.
