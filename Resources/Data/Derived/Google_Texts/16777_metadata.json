The EEOC charged that the manager also frequently made sexually offensive comments, including remarks about the bodies of female employees and about his genitals. The restaurant's general manager not only failed to take prompt action to stop the sexual harassment, but he too had a history of making vulgar and sexually charged remarks about female employees, the lawsuit claimed.\n\nSubjecting employees to a sexually hostile work environment violates Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The EEOC filed suit (EEOC v. Red Lobster Restaurants LLC, Civil Action No. 1:13-cv-02860-MJG) in U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland, Northern Division, after first attempting to reach a pre-litigation settlement through its conciliation process.\n\nIn addition to the $160,000 in monetary relief to the three claimants, the two-year consent decree enjoins Red Lobster from engaging in or condoning sexual harassment or engaging in unlawful retaliation at its Salisbury facility. The restaurant will provide training to all of its employees at that facility regarding compliance with the federal anti-discrimination laws, with an emphasis on the prohibitions against sexual harassment and retaliation, and will post a notice regarding the settlement.\n\n\"Sexual harassment should not be tolerated by any employer,\" said Spencer H. Lewis, Jr., district director of the EEOC's Philadelphia District Office said. \"It's especially pernicious when a manager is the alleged harasser.\"\n\nEEOC Regional Attorney Debra M. Lawrence added, \"Sexual harassment remains a persistent problem in the workplace. The EEOC is pleased that Red Lobster worked with us to resolve this matter and will provide equitable relief and training to prevent sexual harassment and employment discrimination at that location.\"\n\nThe EEOC initially named GMRI, Inc., d/b/a Red Lobster, a subsidiary of Darden Restaurants, Inc., as the defendant in the lawsuit. Red Lobster was sold by defendant GMRI, and its Salisbury subsidiary is currently operated and managed by Red Lobster Restaurants, LLC, which replaced GMRI as the defendant in the litigation.\n\nThe EEOC Philadelphia District Office has jurisdiction over Pennsylvania, Maryland, Delaware, West Virginia and parts of New Jersey and Ohio. The legal staff of the EEOC Philadelphia District Office also prosecutes discrimination cases arising from Washington, D.C. and parts of Virginia.", "article_metadata": {"description": "EEOC filed suit alegeding a sexually hostile work environmentafter first attempting to reach a pre litigation settlement through its conciliation process.
