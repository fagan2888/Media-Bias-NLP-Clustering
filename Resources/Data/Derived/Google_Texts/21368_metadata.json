You could be facing much higher drug costs with an exchange plan.\n\nThat's true especially if you take specialty drugs for ailments such as HIV, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis and cancer.\n\nThe reason? Many plans make you pay coinsurance - a percentage of a drug's cost - as opposed to copays, which are set amounts.\n\nAccording to a recent study by Avalere Health, 59% of silver plans on exchanges across the country use co-insurance as opposed to fixed co-payments.\n\nAnd 23% of silver plans have co-insurance rates of 30% percent or more on the highest formulary tier.\n\nSixty percent of lower-premium bronze plans apply specialty tier co-insurance of more than 30% of the drug price. Among platinum plans, 38% require co-insurance.\n\nThe bottom line: \"You will pay dramatically more,\" Avalere Health senior manager Jenna Stento told the Daily News.\n\nMost of the drugs Avalere looked at cost more than $1,000 - which would mean a co-payment of $300. Some of these meds can cost $5,000 or more.\n\nIn contrast, a co-payment might cost $90 or less.\n\n\"This latest analysis further underscores that exchange enrollees could face high out-of-pocket costs, particularly for specialty medications,\" said Caroline Pearson, vice president at Avalere Health.\n\n\"High prevalence of co-insurance can also make costs unpredictable for patients who struggle to translate cost-sharing percentages into actual dollars.\"", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "PHYLLIS FURMAN", "twitter": {"description": "Ouch!
