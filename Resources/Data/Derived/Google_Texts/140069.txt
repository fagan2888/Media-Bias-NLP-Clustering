DICKERSON: Well, are they unrealistic about what can be done government? That’s the dysfunction.

BOEHNER: Absolutely they’re unrealistic.

But the Bible says, beware of false prophets. And there are people out there spreading noise about how much can get done. I mean, this whole idea that we were going to shut down the government to get rid of Obamacare in 2013, this plan never had a chance.

But over the course of the August recess in 2013, and the course of September, lot of my Republican colleagues who knew it was a fool’s errand really they were getting all this pressure from home to do this. And so we have got groups here in town, members of the House and Senate here in town who whip people into a frenzy believing they can accomplish things that they know, they know are never going to happen.

People often forget that there are rules of etiquette and decorum that most members of Congress adhere to when they are speaking about their colleagues. Boehner didn’t mention Cruz by name, but he didn’t have to. Everyone knows that Sen. Cruz is responsible for the government shutdown in 2013.

Cruz has built his entire career off of promising things that he knows can’t be accomplished, but he cons Republicans into believing that it can be done, and after the scheme fails, Cruz walks away and blames everyone else.

John Boehner is making his true feelings known as he walks out the door, and into retirement. Sen. Cruz (R-TX) has few supporters in Congress, and judging by his poll numbers, few supporters behind his presidential campaign.

Speaker Boehner is leaving and seems intent on settling a few scores on his way out the door.
