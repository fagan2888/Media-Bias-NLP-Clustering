(So don\u2019t feel like a complete dork if you asked that, too.)\n\nFor those not in the know, WhatsApp is a smartphone app that lets users send messages over the Internet, avoiding text messaging charges from wireless carriers. And it has very quickly become a very big deal in mobile messaging, a key part of the push by Facebook and others toward broader, global mobile supremacy.\n\nRelated: How My Mom Killed Facebook\n\nThe Mountain View, CA, startup says 450 million people use its service each month, with about 70 percent using it daily. It also says it is adding 1 million registered users a day, allowing Facebook to tout its potential to reach 1 billion or more people in the next few years.\n\nDespite that trajectory, WhatsApp may be far less familiar to smartphone users in the United States \u2014 even those who have loaded their iPhones or Android models with apps like Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, Angry Birds or Candy Crush Saga.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t get as much attention in the U.S. as it deserves because its community started off growing in Europe, India and Latin America, but WhatsApp is a very important and valuable worldwide communication network,\u201d Facebook\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg told analysts on a conference call Wednesday. \u201cIn fact, WhatsApp is the only widely used app we\u2019ve ever seen that has more engagement and a higher percent of people using it daily than Facebook itself.\u201d\n\nRelated: Facebook \u2018Likes\u2019 Tax Schemes to Avoid Paying Uncle Sam\n\nBoth the relatively low profile and the engagement are the result of the approach taken by WhatsApp co-founders Jan Koum and Brian Acton since they started the company in 2009. The two former Yahoo employees and their team focused entirely on the product and the users. They spent no money on marketing or user acquisition, venture capitalist Jim Goetz of Sequoia Capital noted in a post on Tumblr after the deal was announced. Sequoia, the only venture firm to back WhatsApp, invested a reported $60 million in the company.\n\n\u201cWhile others sought attention, Jan and Brian shunned the spotlight, refusing even to hang a sign outside the WhatsApp offices in Mountain View,\u201d Goetz wrote. \u201cAs competitors promoted games and rushed to build platforms, Jan and Brian remained devoted to a clean, lightning fast communications service that works flawlessly.\u201d\n\nWhatsApp may be a huge hit, but that still leaves the second key question: Is it really worth the enormous sum Facebook is paying to make its largest acquisition by far? The $19 billion purchase price works out to about $42 for each of WhatsApp\u2019s monthly users \u2014 or $345 million for every one of its 55 employees.\n\nFacebook has its own Messenger service, which is popular in the U.S. but trails competitors like WhatsApp and others internationally. The deal dramatically extends Facebook\u2019s global reach in messaging at a point when foreign sales have grown to account more than half of Facebook\u2019s ad business. The deal also helps further diversify Facebook\u2019s business beyond just the core social network, helping ensure it won\u2019t simply go the way of MySpace, Pivotal Research Group analyst Brian Wieser wrote Wednesday. Last year, Facebook had sought to buy another messaging app, Snapchat, for $3 billion but was spurned.\n\nWhatsApp is reportedly profitable, but analysts peppered Zuckerberg and Facebook CFO David Ebersman with questions about the valuation and how Facebook plans to make money off the acquisition. The answers were reminiscent of one given often back in the days of the dotcom boom: eyeballs.\n\n\u201cInternet services that reach a billion people are all incredibly valuable, and we believe WhatsApp will be as well,\u201d Zuckerberg said. \u201cOur focus will remain on connecting more people and increasing engagement, but over the long term we look forward to seeing what the team can do to build a really great business.\u201d WhatsApp lets users send messages for free for a year. After that, it charges 99 cents a year. \u201cWe\u2019re not really concerned about monetization today. We\u2019re focused on growth,\u201d WhatsApp co-founder and CEO Jan Koum said on the conference call.\n\nThe WhatsApp founders have shunned integrating ads \u2014 where Facebook makes it money \u2014 into their messaging service. The app\u2019s existing subscription model, Zuckerberg said, is a \u201cpromising start.\u201d Stronger monetization will come eventually, Zuckerberg said: \u201cWe believe that, once we get to being a service that has a billion, 2 billion, maybe even 3 billion people one day, that there are many clear ways that we can monetize.\u201d\n\nFor now, though, the price looks rich. \u201cWhile we see strategic merit, the acquisition is difficult to justify on metrics we use to value Facebook,\u201d Pivotal Research Group\u2019s Wieser wrote in downgrading the stock from a \u201cBuy\u201d to a \u201cHold.\u201d\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Facebook\u2019s announcement late Wednesday of a $19 billion deal to buy WhatsApp instantly raised a couple of questions.
