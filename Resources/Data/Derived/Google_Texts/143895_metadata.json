Since recreational sales began in Colorado and Washington last year, the number of publicly traded cannabis companies has grown from 13 to 300\u2014and sales of legal marijuana reached $2.7 billion dollars last year.\n\nGreg Levy, who runs food packaging company Point Five Packaging hopes that his business can capitalize on the new earning opportunities from legal marijuana. \"The two people that get rich in a gold rush are the miners and the people that sell axes,\" says Levy. \"Our packaging comes in the form of axes.\"\n\nEntrepreneurs aren\u2019t the only ones waking up to pot\u2019s profit potential\u2014even politicians see big opportunity in promoting legal weed. Sen. Rand Paul became the first presidential candidate to raise money from the cannabis industry when he held a private fundraiser for summit attendees.\n\n\"Four years ago you had to chase down the presidential candidates and really nag them to talk about marijuana,\" says Mason Tvert, communications director of the Marijuana Policy Project. \"Now we\u2019re seeing all of the candidates being asked about it all the time and being open about. It\u2019s hard to ignore at this point. You have business owners. You\u2019ve got employees. You got a base of tax revenue. You really have to start treating this like any other legal industry.\"\n\nReason TV traveled to Denver, Colorado, for the National Cannabis Industry Association's second annual Cannabis Business Summit to find out how legalization is driving innovation and growth in the thriving\u2014and legal\u2014marijuana economy.\n\nProduced by Alexis Garcia and Alex Manning.
