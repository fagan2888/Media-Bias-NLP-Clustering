Perhaps the Los Angeles Dodgers can harness Juan Nicasio’s talent.

The Dodgers acquired the big, hard-throwing right-hander from the Rockies Monday for a player to be named later or cash considerations. Nicasio was designated for assignment by the Rockies last week.

Nicasio, 28, went 6-6 with a 5.38 ERA for the Rockies in 2014, pitching in both relief and as a starter. But the Rockies ran out of patience waiting for him to develop. Nicasio is 21-22 with a 5.03 ERA in 88 major league games.

Nicasio, who made $2.025 million last season, is eligible for arbitration for the first time. He is expected to receive about $2.4 million for the 2015 season. Colorado general manager Jeff Bridich said last week that Nicasio’s salary was one of the factors in the team’s decision to designate him for assignment.

The Dodgers will look to see if Nicasio can fit into the back end of their rotation. If not, he could find a spot in the bullpen. After a tune-up trip down to Triple-A last season, Nicasio returned to the Rockies and pitched in relief. He posted a 3.48 ERA in 19 games out of the bullpen and his fastball averaged about 95 mph.

Armed with a good fastball, Nicasio made his major-league debut May 28, 2011, at age 24, jumping directly from Double-A to the Rockies. But his rookie season ended in terrifying fashion Aug. 5 that year when he was struck in the head by a line drive, fell on the mound and fractured the C-1 vertebrae in his neck.

Nicasio’s comeback stalled when he suffered a knee injury June 2, 2012, and missed the rest of that season. Knee pain, and a feeling of instability on the mound that came with it, dogged Nicasio for most of the 2013 season. But he managed to pitch a career-high 157 ⅔ innings.

To make room for Nicasio on their 40-man roster, the Dodgers designated infielder Ryan Jackson for assignment.
