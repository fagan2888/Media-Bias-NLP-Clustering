It lasted about 10 minutes.\n\nIn English, Roy briefly answered five or six questions and then he was on his way back to the Avalanche\u2019s hotel.\n\nDowntown Montreal feels like France. The language begins with French. The architecture feels like Paris. And on Saturday \u2014 a day after the terrorist attacks in Paris \u2014 the mood was somber. Roy was delicate.\n\n\u201cQuite honestly, I heard about it this morning,\u201d Roy said of the attacks. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think I\u2019m in position to make any comment. I haven\u2019t read about it. It would be inappropriate for me to comment.\u201d\n\nIn a tribute to the victims in France, the Canadiens, the franchise, had three national anthems to begin the game \u2014 Canadian, American and French.\n\nEasy solution. The NHL is digging deep for ideas to increase scoring. The goalie pads must shrink or the nets must get bigger. Roy \u2014 perhaps the greatest goalie of all time \u2014 has stuck with one solution since he began answering the question last week: Shave the iron.\n\nNHL nets are built around a 2 3/8-inch galvanized steel frame. Making them thinner from the inside out would create more net to shoot at.\n\n\u201cIf every time you hit the crossbar or post, and it goes in \u2014 there\u2019s like three or five times it happens (every game),\u201d Roy said Saturday.\n\nIf trimming the material makes the goal too light, a stretchable tethering mechanism could be applied to the bottom of the post and inside its moorings. The game could use tethered goals regardless.\n\nFalse report. Despite leading a segment in TSN\u2019s \u201cInsider Trading\u201d last week, Avalanche general manager Joe Sakic said he is not looking to move forward Matt Duchene, 24, a Canadian Olympian who was the third overall pick in the 2009 NHL draft.\n\n\u201cMatt has been a great player for this franchise. Just because his name is out there \u2014 and I don\u2019t know who starts this stuff \u2014 but this is a reality of our business,\u201d Sakic said Saturday. \u201cIt\u2019s not a big deal. It\u2019s not something players should worry.\u201d\n\nSakic had a talk with Duchene.\n\n\u201cI have told him, \u2018You can\u2019t worry about this,\u2019 \u201d Sakic said. \u201cAt the end of the day for a player, is it a bad thing? No, it means people are talking about you.\u201d\n\nQuiet the crowd. Winning has a way of putting a halt to trade rumors. Continuing to win on this franchise-long, seven-game road trip would do just that.\n\n\u201cIf we come out of this trip with a really good record, there\u2019s less pressure to think about things like that,\u201d Sakic said. \u201cRumors happen to teams that are struggling and probably not doing what they\u2019re expected to do. There were rumors about me during my career. You can\u2019t worry about them. They\u2019re just rumors.\n\n\u201cAre there conversations? There are conversation about every single player on every single team. That\u2019s the reality. But it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean you want to do something.\u201d\n\nMike Chambers: mchambers @denverpost.com or @mikechambers\n\nSpotlight on \u2026\n\nTyler Bozak, C, Maple Leafs\n\nWhen: The Avalanche visits Toronto on Tuesday at the Air Canada Centre. After Saturday\u2019s game at Montreal, Colorado has two full days to prepare for the Maple Leafs, who hosted the Canucks on Saturday and visit the Rangers on Sunday.\n\nWhat\u2019s up: The rebuilding Maple Leafs entered Saturday with points in their previous four games, including going 2-0 on the road against the Central Division last week. They won 3-2 at Dallas before edging Nashville 2-1 in a shootout. Bozak is Toronto\u2019s top center.\n\nBackground: From Regina, Sasketchewan, Bozak joined the University of Denver as a 21-year-old freshman in 2007. He scored 18 goals and ultimately had 26-of-30 NHL teams trying to sign him as a free agent before he settled on Toronto after his injury-plagued sophomore season limited him to 19 games (eight goals, 23 points).\n\nChambers\u2019 take: Bozak, who produced a career-high 23 goals last season, maintains a home in Denver and remains close with his former college teammates and his alma mater. He undoubtedly wouldn\u2019t mind taking his talents to Colorado and living there full time, and the no-trade clause attached to his $4.2 million annual contract will allow him to choose his next stop.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Chambers: Patrick Roy respectfully declines comment in wake of Paris", "title": "Chambers: Patrick Roy respectfully declines comment in wake of Paris", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/11/14/chambers-patrick-roy-respectfully-declines-comment-in-wake-of-paris/", "image": {"width": 512, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg", "height": 512}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-11-14T19:04:22+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-20T08:06:39+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\u201cIf every time you hit the crossbar or post, and it goes in \u2014 there\u2019s like three or five times it happens (every game),\u201d Roy said Saturday.\nMONTREAL \u2014Following Saturday\u2019s morning skate at the Bell Centre, coach Patrick Roy began his news conference in French.\nIn English, Roy briefly answered five or six questions and then he was on his way back to the Avalanche\u2019s hotel.\nBackground: From Regina, Sasketchewan, Bozak joined the University of Denver as a 21-year-old freshman in 2007.\nAnd on Saturday \u2014 a day after the terrorist attacks in Paris \u2014 the mood was somber."}
