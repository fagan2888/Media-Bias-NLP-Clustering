First, he issued a public \u201cclown nose on\u201d statement saying he\u2019s just a jester and shouldn\u2019t be taken seriously.\n\nTuesday night, he attacked President Barack Obama for repeatedly lying to the American people about his \u201csignature,\u201d \u201chistoric\u201d health care reform. But those dastardly conservatives are lying, too.\n\nSo there.\n\nOf course, Stewart is trying to equate the words of conservative commentators with the President of the United States of America and a policy that will impact all of our lives. Surely, the two are not quite the same, and Stewart knows it.\n\nSecond, he\u2019s doing his standard cherry-picking clip-o-rama without recognizing many of the other damning facts about ObamaCare. It\u2019s Stewart the Spinmeister General once more, and whatever outrage he feigned over Obama breaking his pledge to the country has given way to his standard attacks on the right.\n\nTo be fair, Stewart does a mighty fine impression of Edith Bunker.
