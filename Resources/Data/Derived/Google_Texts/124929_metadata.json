The Las Vegas Sun reports that the wedding rate in Sin City has plummeted 37 percent in the past decade\u2014nearly 47,000 fewer couples got married in 2014 than in 2004.\n\nBy comparison, 2004 was a boom year for weddings in Sin City. There were 128,000 weddings that year\u2014including Britney Spears\u2019 55-hour marriage to Jason Allen Alexander at A Little White Wedding Chapel.\n\nRelated: Marriage?? Young Americans Aren\u2019t Even Shacking Up\n\nWho knows why gambling on love in Sin City has become a losing bet? Perhaps the dip reflects a national trend of millennials waiting to tie the knot or choosing to stay single. The marriage rate in the U.S. neared a record low in 2015 and is expected to drop further in 2016. Then there\u2019s the expense. According to the TheKnot, the average wedding cost (excluding the honeymoon) is $31,213, with many couples looking for more unusual venues.\n\nClark County Clerk Lynn Goya, who took office in January, wants to change that trend in Vegas. The current fee for a marriage license in Las Vegas is $60, but Goya is asking for a $14 increase in the cost of wedding licenses to support marketing efforts targeting engaged couples. Last year 81,000 weddings happened in Las Vegas\u2014and she\u2019s hoping that wedding vow renewals and gay weddings will help boost those numbers even more. In New York, the legalization of gay marriage in 2011 led to an estimated $259 million in spending and $16 million in revenues for New York City.\n\nRelated: The $2.6 Billion Gay Wedding Boom\n\nThen again it may be hard for Las Vegas to shake that quickie, drive-thru wedding image. Sin City has always had an illustrious history of celebrity weddings, with many more misses than hits: Cher\u2019s nine-day union to rocker Gregg Allman in 1975, Mia Farrow and Frank Sinatra in 1966, Demi Moore and Bruce Willis in 1987, Richard Gere and Cindy Crawford in 1991, and Angelina Jolie and Billy Bob Thornton in 2000. On the bright side, there\u2019s Paul Newman and Joanne Woodward\u2019s marriage, which endured for 50 years, Jon Bon Jovi and his wife, Dorothea\u2019s 1987 wedding day, and Kelly Ripa and Mark Consuelo\u2019s union from 1996, which is still standing.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "When it comes to destination weddings, Las Vegas has lost that loving feeling.
