The problem is that too many of those jobs pay too little, experts say.\n\nHow Uber knows your phone battery is dying and more\n\nWhy Congress is looking at labels to curb food waste\n\nSmoke detected on EgyptAir Flight 804: What does that mean?\n\nA homeless woman sits on a bench a few blocks away from the White House in downtown Washington. The US poverty rate rose slightly to 14.8 percent last year even as median household incomes crept to $53,657, the U.S. Census Bureau said on Wednesday.\n\nNearly 47 million Americans were living in poverty last year, a percentage that has remained largely unchanged, according to a census report out Wednesday.\n\nThe poverty rate from 2013 rose slightly from 14.5 percent to 14.8 percent, and real household median income slipped from $54,462 to $53,657. Researchers say that these differences are not statistically significant.\n\nWhat's significant, however, is the fact that the number of people in poverty hasn\u2019t considerably changed from official estimates for the past four years \u2013 even as the economy continues to make advances.\n\nRecommended: Are the rich getting richer? Take our quiz on inequality and incomes.\n\nNationwide unemployment, for instance, is down to 5.1 percent, its lowest in nearly seven and a half years, according to data released this month by the Department of Labor.\n\nSo why are so many Americans still living in poverty?\n\n\u201cOften we see the poverty rate lagging behind economic recovery. So I wasn\u2019t initially surprised that the poverty rate didn\u2019t go down as quickly as economic recovery [advanced],\u201d says Julia B. Isaacs, a senior fellow at the Center on Labor, Human Services, and Population at the Urban Institute. \u201cBut it does appear that this recovery lasts longer than past recessions.\u201d\n\nWhile there has been strong job growth, one of the reasons for stagnant poverty numbers is that many of the jobs fall into the low-wage sector, says Ms. Isaacs.\n\n\u201cGood jobs and higher wages are what people need,\u201d she adds. \u201cI wish it weren\u2019t so challenging to see job growth in those areas.\u201d\n\nSectors that have seen large gains in the past year are healthcare and social assistance, financial and business services, and food and beverage establishments. Healthcare has swelled by 457,000 in the past year, and 31,000 jobs on average are added to the food industry each month, according to the Department of Labor.\n\nBut this may be doing little to alleviate the poverty burden, as nearly 6.5 million Americans work part time because they cannot find a full-time job or because their hours have been cut back.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of practices that have come in \u2014 some aided by technologies \u2014 that have allowed employers to cut back on their wage costs,\u201d Sheldon Danziger, president of the Russell Sage Foundation, which supports research on poverty, told The Los Angeles Times.\n\nThere is some good news. The number of \u201cdiscouraged workers\u201d \u2013 that is, people who say they\u2019ve given up on the job search \u2013 has gone down substantially by 151,000 from a year earlier.\n\nAnd the number of people without health insurance in 2014 dropped by 8.8 million to 33 million \u2013 making it 90 percent of Americans who had coverage last year, according to NPR.\n\nSign-up increases came in every state, and in government as well as private coverage, said researchers. But it is the first full year measuring the impact of the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare.\n\nSocial welfare programs are invaluable in relieving poverty, says Isaacs. Citing proposals to defund initiatives like the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), she urged lawmakers not \u201cto retract the safety net.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.content.id": "041b828e266818cbb3b6acb183ce609e", "sailthru.author": "Michelle Toh", "description": "The national poverty level remained unchanged last year, even as strong job growth brought optimism.
