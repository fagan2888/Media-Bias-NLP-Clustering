Borum recently married his long-time girlfriend in his hospital bed at Good Samaritan Hospital in West Islip, located on Long Island, after nurses and medical staff raised the money for a wedding celebration complete with rings, flowers, and cake.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s everything, he\u2019s my life\u2026 he\u2019s my better half. So why not marry him?\u201d Nina Borum, the newlywed wife, told WABC.\n\nThe couple has been together for three years, but Borum was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma 18 months ago. At the beginning, he fought the disease with hope for recovery; but recently, doctors gave him bad news \u2014 his cancer was terminal, and he didn\u2019t have much time left.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s been really going through so much and he can\u2019t walk,\u201d Nina Borum told ABC News. \u201cIt\u2019s hard on him. He\u2019s really hard\u2026It\u2019s just sunk his spirit.\u201d\n\nBut she also noted that their wedding day was beautiful. \u201cThe whole thing was great,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t know what my favorite moment was. I couldn\u2019t imagine how great it could be or would be. The staff just outdid themselves \u2026We couldn\u2019t have done it no better.\u201d\n\nNon-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma is a cancer that begins in the lymphatic system, where tumors develop from lymphocytes, or white blood cells. According to the American Cancer Society, some 71,000 people will be diagnosed with NHL any given year.\n\nThe hospital staff gathered around Borum\u2019s bed as the couple got married. Afterwards, they felt proud to have helped raise funds for the celebration. \u201cWe had things donated from different people that we knew, the flowers, the cake, invitations, rings,\u201d said Christina Ware, a nurse at Good Samaritan Hospital. \u201cWe actually raised money for the rings ourselves.\u201d\n\nABC US News | World News", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "cancer, patient, keith, borum, marries, girlfriend, his, hospital, bed, heartwarming, video", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Keith and Nina Borum decided they wanted to get married \u2014 even though Keith wasn\u2019t able to leave his hospital room.", "title": "Terminally Ill Patient Marries Girlfriend From His Hospital Bed [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/cancer-patient-keith-borum-marries-girlfriend-his-hospital-bed-heartwarming-video-342664", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured/public/2015/07/13/happy-couple.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Keith and Nina Borum decided they wanted to get married \u2014 even though Keith wasn\u2019t able to leave his hospital room.", "title": "Terminally Ill Patient Marries Girlfriend From His Hospital Bed [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/cancer-patient-keith-borum-marries-girlfriend-his-hospital-bed-heartwarming-video-342664", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured/public/2015/07/13/happy-couple.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/07/13/happy-couple.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-07-13T11:47:02-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-07-13T11:47:01-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Keith and Nina Borum decided they wanted to get married \u2014 even though Keith wasn\u2019t able to leave his hospital room."}, "article_summary": "Being diagnosed with terminal cancer wasn\u2019t going to stop Keith Borum from marrying the love of his life.\nThe hospital staff gathered around Borum\u2019s bed as the couple got married.\n\u201cHe\u2019s been really going through so much and he can\u2019t walk,\u201d Nina Borum told ABC News.\n\u201cHe\u2019s everything, he\u2019s my life\u2026 he\u2019s my better half.\nThe couple has been together for three years, but Borum was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma 18 months ago."}
