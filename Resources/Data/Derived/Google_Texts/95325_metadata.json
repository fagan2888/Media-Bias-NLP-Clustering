Few offer Casey\u2019s versatility.\n\nHe ranks as the only player in the last three years to play 900 snaps on special teams and take 900 snaps from scrimmage. He also played for Gary Kubiak in Houston from 2009-12, extending the strong gravitational pull of ex-Texans to Dove Valley.\n\nCasey will sign his contract on Monday when the Broncos begin phase one of their offseason program.\n\nThe former Rice University star provides options, blending a skill set similar to Jacob Tamme, if not Patrick Hape, a Broncos tight end a decade ago. Casey can line up at tight end, H-back and fullback, where Juwan Thompson and Joe Don Duncan remain leading candidates to fill that newly created role in Kubiak\u2019s zone-blocking offense.\n\nCasey, 30, caught a career-high 34 passes in 2012, but his role shrank under new Eagles coach Chip Kelly over the last two seasons.\n\nHe figures to help anchor special teams, which have been spotty for Denver at times the last seasons. Casey played an NFL-best 439 special teams snaps a year ago, posting 13 tackles and blocking two punts.\n\nHis career began late as he first pursued big-league dreams after being drafted by the Chicago White Sox in the seventh round in 2003. After failing to advance past rookie ball in three seasons, going 4-10 with a 5.82 ERA in 44 games, Casey turned to football.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Broncos agree to one-year deal with tight end James Casey", "title": "Broncos agree to one-year deal with tight end James Casey", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/04/11/broncos-agree-to-one-year-deal-with-tight-end-james-casey/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150223__james-caseyp1.jpg", "height": 436}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150223__james-caseyp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2015-04-11T10:52:13+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-24T19:11:53+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf9b1\"", "article_summary": "The former Rice University star provides options, blending a skill set similar to Jacob Tamme, if not Patrick Hape, a Broncos tight end a decade ago.\nCasey played an NFL-best 439 special teams snaps a year ago, posting 13 tackles and blocking two punts.\nFamiliarity met opportunity, leading James Casey to agree to a one-year deal with the Broncos on Saturday.\nHe figures to help anchor special teams, which have been spotty for Denver at times the last seasons.\nCasey visited the Broncos during a February snowstorm, and when the skies cleared six weeks later, Denver still needed a utility player."}
