On this week’s “Saturday Night Live,” Sasheer Zamata went on Weekend Update to respond to recent criticism of tech giants Google and Apple for lack of diversity.

Zamata noted that while there are over 800 emojis available on iPhone apps, not a single one is of a black person.

“Unicode, the company that creates emojis, thought that instead of one black person we needed two different kinds of dragons, nine different cat faces, three generations of a white family, and all the hands are white too. Even the black power fist is white!”
