Children can absorb these messages and ideas.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s difficult to overstate the dangers,\u201d she continues. \u201cFifty Shades of Grey teaches your daughter that pain and humiliation are erotic, and your son, that girls want a man who will control and intimidate them.\u201d\n\nGirls night watching a private screening of Fifty Shades of Grey!!!!!! OMG it's sooooo good!!!!! \u2014 Kim Kardashian West (@KimKardashian) February 4, 2015\n\nThe \u201chard sell\u201d is evident even at family big box store Target, which is reportedly selling \u201cFifty Shades of Grey Sex Toys\u201d right next to children\u2019s toothbrushes.\n\nAnd the \u201cdangers\u201d are not lost on domestic violence activists, who are urging both a boycott of the film and that money that would have been spent on movie tickets is donated to shelters for victims of domestic violence.\n\nReal women \u201cdon\u2019t end up like Anastasia; they often end up in a women\u2019s shelter, on the run for years, or dead,\u201d said the National Center on Sexual Exploitation, one of the sponsors of the #50DollarsNot50Shades campaign to raise funds for domestic violence programs.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s sad that we are at a point in our culture at which I feel a responsibility to speak up about this and give parents advice about how to protect their kids from this,\u201d Grossman said. \u201cThe whole idea of romanticizing emotional and sexual abuse in an intimate relationship is overwhelming,\u201d she continued. \u201cEven if people don\u2019t see the movie, it trickles down in our culture.\u201d\n\nGrossman, the author of Unprotected: A Campus Psychiatrist Reveals How Political Correctness in her Profession Endangers Every Student, especially observes that some who have been given authority in our culture are introducing young people to the concept that \u201canything whatsoever is okay between consenting adults.\u201d\n\nA recent video expos\u00e9 series (see above) by pro-life organization Live Action illustrates Grossman\u2019s point. The organization exposed a Planned Parenthood counselor who\u2013citing the book Fifty Shades of Grey\u2013told an undercover investigator she believed to be 15 years old, \u201c[A]nything within the sexual world is normal as long as it\u2019s consensual,\u201d and that if her sex partner \u201cwants to try something that \u2026 is gonna cause you harm or pain, and you\u2019re okay with that, that\u2019s a completely different thing than [sic] if he wants to try something to do that you\u2019re not okay with[.]\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s faulty logic\u2013that every decision a person makes that is not coerced is okay,\u201d Grossman explained. \u201cIt\u2019s being framed as a \u2018personal choice,\u2019 but the ultimate goal here is sexual freedom\u2013not sexual health.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe title of the book and the film says it all,\u201d Grossman added. \u201cThere is no black and white; it\u2019s all \u2018grey,\u2019 and everything is relative, while nothing is clear.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen it comes to abuse, humiliation, and battering, they\u2019d like us to believe there is no black and white\u2013just \u2018grey,\u2019\u201d she said.\n\nDespite her assessment that the movie is a \u201cdark cloud,\u201d Grossman states the release of the film has its \u201csilver lining.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt gives parents the opportunity to discuss with their sons and daughters the big differences between healthy versus unhealthy relationships,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s actually a plus for parents to show some anxiety when discussing these issues with their kids because then they know this is \u2018something big.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2019My parents must really love me and think this is important,\u2019 kids will understand, when their parents approach them on these issues,\u201d Grossman added.\n\n\u201cThe world is really upside down in many ways, and the message kids are getting on college campuses is the glamorization of this abusive form of sex,\u201d she said.\n\nThe American College of Pediatricians is also expressing concern about the influence of Fifty Shades and similar media on children and the culture, and \u201curges parents to be ever more vigilant and to teach their children to be discriminating about the media they view.\u201d\n\n\u201cA prime example is the soon-to-be-released film Fifty Shades of Grey,\u201d the College continues in a press release, adding that the sexual relationship depicted between the movie\u2019s two main characters asserts \u201cthe normalization of dating violence, intimate partner violence (IPV) and the romanticizing of bondage, submission and sadomasochism (BDSM).\u201d\n\nObserving that the adolescent brain is not yet fully developed, leaving teens more vulnerable to suggestions and open to risk-taking behaviors, the College adds:\n\nThey are also more easily addicted to drugs, alcohol, sexual activity and other behaviors which stimulate the \u201creward center\u201d of the brain as compared to adults. For these reasons, adolescents need parents to correct the dangerous messages about alcohol, sex and violence in Fifty Shades of Grey. Specifically, adolescents need to know that regardless of the intentions of the individuals involved, sexual activity biochemically bonds a woman and a man. Consequently, sexual activity, like drugs and alcohol, impairs critical thinking and decision making. Finally, and most importantly, adolescents must be told in no uncertain terms that verbal, emotional, physical and sexual violence is never acceptable. Healthy relationships are characterized by warmth, open communication, respect and mutuality. One of the most powerful deterrents to adolescent sexual activity, drug and alcohol use is the firm communication of parental expectations to their children.\n\n\u201c[I]t is imperative parents \u2018immunize\u2019 their children and adolescents against the toxic messages in this series of novels and film,\u201d the pediatricians assert.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Health experts are warning parents of the dangers of the film version of the book Fifty Shades of Grey due to the sexual violence depicted.", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Health experts are warning parents of the dangers of the film version of the book Fifty Shades of Grey due to the sexual violence depicted.", "title": "Health Experts Warn Parents 'Fifty Shades of Grey' Film May Harm Kids - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/02/Fifty-Shades-640x480.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-hollywood/2015/02/07/health-experts-warn-parents-fifty-shades-of-grey-film-may-harm-kids/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Health experts are warning parents of the dangers of the film version of the book Fifty Shades of Grey due to the sexual violence depicted.", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/02/Fifty-Shades-640x480.jpg", "title": "Health Experts Warn Parents 'Fifty Shades of Grey' Film May Harm Kids - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "American College of Pediatricians, bdsm, campus sexual assault, Culture, Domestic Violence, Dr. Miriam Grossman, Fifty Shades of Grey, Planned Parenthood, Sexual Abuse, Target,Big Hollywood, Education,Fifty Shades of Grey", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Big Hollywood", "tag": "Target", "published_time": "2015-02-07T13:07:09-07:00", "categories": "Big Hollywood,Education"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "\u201cDon\u2019t underestimate the impact of the hard sell on your kids,\u201d Grossman warns parents.\nFinally, and most importantly, adolescents must be told in no uncertain terms that verbal, emotional, physical and sexual violence is never acceptable.\nFor these reasons, adolescents need parents to correct the dangerous messages about alcohol, sex and violence in Fifty Shades of Grey.\n]\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s faulty logic\u2013that every decision a person makes that is not coerced is okay,\u201d Grossman explained.\n\u2014 Kim Kardashian West (@KimKardashian) February 4, 2015The \u201chard sell\u201d is evident even at family big box store Target, which is reportedly selling \u201cFifty Shades of Grey Sex Toys\u201d right next to children\u2019s toothbrushes."}
