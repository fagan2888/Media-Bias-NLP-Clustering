Oprah Winfrey has bought a 10 percent stake in the diet company and is joining its board. The news caused the Weight Watchers\u2019 sagging stock to nearly double in Monday morning trading.\n\nCan Oprah work her magic on the struggling weight-loss business? Here\u2019s what you need to know.\n\nWhat\u2019s Oprah doing with Weight Watchers?\n\nShe\u2019s spending $43.2 million to buy into the business. She\u2019ll also receive an option to purchase an additional 5 percent stake. Oprah will also be joining the weight-loss program and \u201cwill candidly share her experiences,\u201d the company said. Oprah\u2019s name and image will be all over Weight Watchers\u2019 marketing.\n\nRelated: The Flabby Business of Shrinking Waistlines\n\n\"Weight Watchers has given me the tools to begin to make the lasting shift that I and so many of us who are struggling with weight have longed for,\" Oprah said in the statement announcing her partnership with the company. \"I believe in the program so much I decided to invest in the company and partner in its evolution.\"\n\nWhat \u201cevolution\u201d is she talking about?\n\n\"We are expanding our purpose from focusing on weight loss alone to more broadly helping people lead a healthier, happier life,\" Jim Chambers, the president and CEO of Weight Watchers International, said in the statement. That broader mission fits perfectly with Oprah\u2019s own brand motto, which promises to help people \u201clive your best life.\u201d\n\nWhy is Weight Watchers doing this?\n\nYou\u2019re kidding, right? It\u2019s Oprah!\n\nSeriously, though, Weight Watchers has had a hard time getting new members to sign up as more people focus on healthy eating rather than diets and a new generation turns toward free or cheap online nutrition plans, smartphone apps and wearable fitness bands.\n\nWeight Watchers shares peaked at $80 in May 2011 and hit $7 last week. Since 2008, the number of people who attend the weekly meetings has dropped from 1.4 million to 800,000. The company was caught off guard by the rise of mobile technology and hasn\u2019t been able to catch up. Its turnaround efforts so far, including signing a new ad agency and introducing a modernized magazine format, have fallen flat. Sales dropped more than 20 percent in each of the first two quarters of 2015.\n\nCan Oprah reinvigorate the Weight Watchers business?\n\nIf anyone can, it\u2019s probably Oprah. While she isn\u2019t the first celebrity spokesman that Weight Watchers has featured \u2014 other pound-dropping celeb endorsers include Marie Osmond, Jessica Simpson, Sarah Ferguson, Jennifer Hudson and Charles Barkley \u2014 she\u2019s by far the most influential.\n\nRelated: 11 Celebs Who Have Dieted for Dollars\n\nOprah\u2019s endorsements of various products and books have resulted in instant boosts to sales and popularity. There\u2019s even a term for her far-reaching impact, the \u201cOprah Effect.\u201d Her millions of followers consistently making purchases based on her suggestions. She\u2019s also famously publicized her weight loss struggles over the years, one of the main ways she\u2019s been so successful in connecting to the general public.\n\nOprah may not have a daily talk show to promote her favorite products anymore, but she does still have carry plenty of weight, so to speak, with her fans. And by owning a piece of the company, she\u2019ll have more incentive to drive real results than a typical celebrity spokesperson.\n\n\u201cFirst and foremost, Winfrey brings an unprecedented level of credibility and commitment to a Weight Watchers endorsement,\u201d Morningstar analyst R.J. Hottovy said in a research note, adding that the Winfrey deal also brings \u201cpotential marketing synergies\u201d and possibly additional value through Oprah\u2019s existing health partnerships.\n\nThat may help explain why Weight Watchers\u2019 stock price closed the day on Monday up 105 percent, meaning Oprah has already more than doubled her money.\n\nHottovy noted that the Winfrey deal doesn\u2019t eliminate questions about how mobile apps and other technologies could threaten the Weight Watchers business \u2014 and that having Oprah on board won\u2019t necessarily help the company attract a younger audience. So whether Weight Watchers ultimately benefits from the deal as much as Oprah does won\u2019t be determined for a while.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Media mogul, billionaire, talk show host, actress, producer, philanthropist \u2014 and the", "title": "Can Oprah Save Weight Watchers?", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/10/19/Can-Oprah-Save-Weight-Watchers", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/oprah_winfrey.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/10/19/Can-Oprah-Save-Weight-Watchers", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/oprah_winfrey.jpg", "title": "The Fiscal Times", "card": "summary", "creator": "@milliedent"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "Media mogul, billionaire, talk show host, actress, producer, philanthropist \u2014 and the", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "So whether Weight Watchers ultimately benefits from the deal as much as Oprah does won\u2019t be determined for a while.\nCan Oprah reinvigorate the Weight Watchers business?\nWhat\u2019s Oprah doing with Weight Watchers?\nMedia mogul, billionaire, talk show host, actress, producer, philanthropist \u2014 and the miracle cure for Weight Watchers?\nThe news caused the Weight Watchers\u2019 sagging stock to nearly double in Monday morning trading."}
