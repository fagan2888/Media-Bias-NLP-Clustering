We caught up with the veteran actor on the phone from California to chat about the season and his character\u2019s arc going forward.\n\nHow much of Mike\u2019s back story were you aware of when you went into the project?\n\nI didn\u2019t have any of it going in, when I said I\u2019d come back and do it. In season 3, maybe, when I give my granddaughter the Mylar balloons and send her off to her mother and then I go and shoot people\u2026 Vince was directing that show and I turned to him and said, that\u2019s my granddaughter; that\u2019s not my daughter. I said that my opinion is, whatever happened to Mike has something to do with his son. Fast-forward a few years, when Peter called me and asked if I would be interested, he asked, do you remember when you said something about your son? And then on episode 6, Gordon [Smith] wrote me a love letter of a script and that\u2019s when we did the back story.\n\nWhen you got the script for that, did that sort of gel with the assumptions you had been operating under so far about the character?\n\nI had made up my mind, certainly, about what it was that had happened to his son, but when I saw the script I thought, great, this works just fine.\n\nHave you envisioned a history for Mike before his time in the police force?\n\nI don\u2019t have a pen in my hand, so I\u2019m not going to be the one who decides that, but I will be doing Mike\u2019s back story probably for the rest of my life; I\u2019ll never be satisfied with it. I\u2019ll have ideas that will never be in cement because I\u2019m not the writer, and I have to be flexible enough to do what I\u2019m given.\n\nWhat sort of ideas?\n\nI think there\u2019s a love somewhere, I think there\u2019s a broken heart somewhere along the way and I hope that comes about.\n\nI hope so too. You had another great episode this season refusing to carry a gun and packing a pimento sandwich instead, which I know was a throwback to \u201cBreaking Bad.\u201d What is it about Mike that gives him the confidence to show up unarmed to a job like that?\n\nWell, he had done his homework about where this money was going to go and what these guys were doing, because they were doing it without the knowledge of their bosses. They\u2019re not going to give him any trouble.\n\nI guess it speaks to a sort of boldness and understanding of the trade.\n\nYeah, and a lot of dramatic license.\n\nAnd the scene with Mike disarming the other guys was great.\n\nOh, it was delightful to shoot, and those guys are such good guys, and they were good actors. All the guys you saw were such good actors! That was a lot of fun. Practicing the takeaway and dumping the clip out\u2026 I love doing that kind of stuff.\n\nThat always helps. The speech he gives to the drug dealer when he talks about good criminals and bad criminals, that seems very much to sum up some of the larger themes of the show as a whole.\n\nI have my problems with that, in that\u2014 I can only speak for myself\u2014 that there are no good criminals. That\u2019s what Jonathan thinks; if you\u2019re a criminal, you\u2019re a criminal, and you\u2019re not going to be forgiving yourself, and you\u2019re certainly not good. But that\u2019s me. Now, as far as dialogue goes, I thought it was great.\n\nAnd from the character\u2019s perspective it seems to really reflect his worldview.\n\nOh yeah, it sums up Mike a lot, about what Mike has gone through. Also, within that, if you adhere to that philosophy, there is a certain reason why his son was killed, you know? The point being, maybe it\u2019s not such a great philosophy.\n\nOne thing that I\u2019ve noticed about \u201cBetter Call Saul\u201d versus \u201cBreaking Bad\u201d is that the show seems to treat Mike and Jimmy really tenderly, whereas \u201cBreaking Bad\u201d was more unflinching with its main characters. Do you feel that there\u2019s a different approach to characterization on the show?\n\n[Interruption] I just walked into the kitchen and my son has just come back from Albuquerque, where\u2019s he\u2019s been working forever, it seems like. I got my boy with me; I\u2019m very happy!\n\nAnyway, now let me answer your question: no. The show, because our crew, our producers, our writers\u2026 I have that sense of feeling very lucky and very much at home. Your point about them treating those characters more gently, I think there\u2019s a lot of truth in that, although I will say to you that there\u2019s no way Jesse wasn\u2019t sympathetic. You really wanted him to straighten up and fly right, you know? The feeling was that what was written when Jesse was concerned\u2026 there was compassion. Walt? Walt was just so wonderful to turn into a complete villain.
