Regarding distasteful language: When a caller makes ad hominem attacks or uses indecent language or obviously racist language, program hosts are certainly permitted to step in. Given that this involves quick judgment during a live television production, it's an imperfect process. The network does not endorse any comments made by our callers, or, for that matter, our guests,\" the description added.\n\nThe network did not bleep out the racial slur in video of the program that was posted to the C-SPAN website.\n\nllarson@nydailynews.com", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "LESLIE LARSON", "twitter": {"description": "A call-in debate turned ugly Thursday on C-SPAN's \"Washington Journal\" when a California Republican used the N-word to refer to President Obama.", "title": "C-SPAN scrambles after caller drops N-word on air", "url": "http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/c-span-scrambles-n-word-article-1.2001484", "image": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2001483.1415294221!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/cspan-obama.jpg", "site": "@nydailynews", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-author": "Leslie Larson", "parsely-type": "article", "sailthru.credits": "NEW YORK DAILY NEWS", "nydn_tags": "entertainment news, tv, c-span, steve scully", "parsely-pub-date": "2014-11-06T17:21:16", "parsely-link": "http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/c-span-scrambles-n-word-article-1.2001484", "parsely-title": "C-SPAN scrambles after caller drops N-word on air", "sailthru.date": "2014-11-06T12:21:16-0500", "sailthru.title": "C-SPAN scrambles after caller drops N-word on air", "nydn_section": "Politics", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2001483.1415294221!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/cspan-obama.jpg", "description": "A call-in debate turned ugly Thursday on C-SPAN's \"Washington Journal\" when a California Republican used the N-word to refer to President Obama.", "robots": "NOARCHIVE", "fb": {"admins": 1594068001, "app_id": 107464888913, "pages": 268914272540}, "msvalidate.01": "02916AAC0DA8B068EFE01D721E03ED7E", "parsely-section": "Politics", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/NYDailyNews/"}, "sailthru.description": "A call-in debate turned ugly Thursday on C-SPAN's \"Washington Journal\" when a California Republican used the N-word to refer to President Obama.", "viewport": "width=device-width, height=device-height, initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no", "og": {"site_name": "NY Daily News", "description": "A call-in debate turned ugly Thursday on C-SPAN's \"Washington Journal\" when a California Republican used the N-word to refer to President Obama.", "title": "C-SPAN scrambles after caller drops N-word on air", "url": "http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/c-span-scrambles-n-word-article-1.2001484", "image": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2001483.1415294221!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/cspan-obama.jpg", "type": "article"}, "parsely-tags": "entertainment news, tv, c-span, steve scully", "p": {"domain_verify": "78efe4f5c9935744af497772f68a0ee7"}, "nydn_byline": "LESLIE LARSON", "parsely-image-url": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2001483.1415294221!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/cspan-obama.jpg"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde272\"", "article_summary": "\"I would just like to say, that the Republicans -- and I'm a Republican -- please do not overreach,\" the caller began.\nThe network did not bleep out the racial slur in video of the program that was posted to the C-SPAN website.\nA representative for C-SPAN said that the network does not use a delay for calls into their programs.\nA call-in debate turned ugly Thursday on C-SPAN's \"Washington Journal\" when a California Republican used the N-word to refer to President Obama.\nRegarding distasteful language: When a caller makes ad hominem attacks or uses indecent language or obviously racist language, program hosts are certainly permitted to step in."}
