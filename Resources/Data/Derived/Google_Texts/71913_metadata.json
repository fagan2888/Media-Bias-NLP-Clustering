But since this is the first week of the new year, let\u2019s take a look at where each of the remaining top(ish)-tier candidates stand.\n\nMost candidates are doing fairly well\u2014they\u2019re raising money and spending less than they bring in, but there are some candidates whose campaigns seem to be circling the drain.\n\nBen Carson\n\nMr. Carson rose to political prominence after he trashed Obamacare at the National Prayer Breakfast in 2013 while President Obama was sitting just a few feet away. The retired neurosurgeon instantly became a Republican hero.\n\nOn May 4, 2015, Mr. Carson announced he would run for president, and by late August, he had become the second favorite for the Republican nomination, behind Donald Trump. He even briefly surpassed Mr. Trump in early November.\n\nBut since then, Mr. Carson\u2019s star as fallen dramatically. His campaign is still raising gobs of money, but odd statements about pyramids and other non-political issues has tarnished his reputation. From first place in early November to fourth place now, Mr. Carson has plunged 15 percentage points in the Real Clear Politics average of polls. In Iowa, whose caucus is coming up on Feb. 1, Mr. Carson has plunged 20 points.\n\nThis, along with three top aides\u2014his campaign manager, communications director and policy director\u2014all resigning in a single day, puts Mr. Carson\u2019s campaign on the \u201cdeath watch\u201d list.\n\nJeb Bush\n\nMr. Bush is still hanging in there as well, though he has dropped from first place with 17.8 percent of the primary vote in July to sixth place now with just 4.3 percent. In most early voting states, Mr. Bush is polling in single digits, still behind Mr. Carson. In New Hampshire, Mr. Bush is currently polling behind New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and Ohio Gov. John Kasich, though he is ahead of Mr. Carson in that state.\n\nIn October, Mr. Bush slashed payroll costs by 40 percent, downsized his Miami office and cut other costs. Shortly after the third Republican presidential debate, a campaign memo was leaked showing Mr. Bush struggling in early voting states. His campaign made 70,000 phone calls in Iowa but identified only 1,200 supporters.\n\nMr. Bush was also doing fine with money, but fourth-quarter fundraising totals aren\u2019t due until the end of January, so we won\u2019t know just how far the former Florida governor has fallen since the summer.\n\nHis campaign is also on the \u201cdeath watch\u201d list.\n\nRand Paul\n\nIt\u2019s time for Mr. Paul to drop out and focus on getting re-elected to the Senate. His campaign never really took off, despite lofty expectations (including from this author). He started with around 8 percent of the primary vote in July, but has steadily declined since, hovering now around 3 percent or lower.\n\nHe\u2019s spending more than he\u2019s bringing in and just barely qualifies for the main stage debates each time. His campaign has also dealt with inter-office conflicts, including the indictment of a longtime aide.\n\nHe joins Mr. Carson and Mr. Bush on the watch list.\n\nMartin O\u2019Malley\n\nMr. O\u2019Malley started the election with around 1.3 percent of the primary vote in July. In the six months since, he has managed to raise his share of the vote to\u2026 3.5 percent. And that\u2019s even after Vice President Joe Biden announced he would not seek his party\u2019s nomination.\n\nO\u2019Malley is also spending more than he\u2019s bringing in, and can\u2019t seem to make any noise in his party despite actually having accomplished the things his rivals Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders say they want to accomplish.\n\nOthers\n\nI don\u2019t count the undercard debaters as having a chance, but the remaining candidates who aren\u2019t considered top-tier are plugging along. I\u2019m talking about Carly Fiorina, Mr. Kasich and Mr. Christie. They\u2019re not spending more than they\u2019re bringing in, but their poll numbers aren\u2019t improving nationally. The upcoming first round of caucuses will be make or break for them\u2014if they can\u2019t get a promising percentage of votes, it will be time to consider dropping out.\n\nAs for the top-tier candidates\u2014Ms. Clinton, Mr. Sanders, Mr. Trump, Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio\u2014as long as they don\u2019t have any epic disasters, continue to raise money and not spend more than they bring in, they should see the herd thinned around them.\n\nDisclosure: Donald Trump is the father-in-law of Jared Kushner, the publisher of Observer Media.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.byline_name": "Ashe Schow", "sailthru.author": "Ashe Schow", "application-name": "Observer", "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://nyoobserver.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/gettyimages-483209392.jpg?quality=80&w=640"}, "site": "@observer", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@Observer"}, "sailthru.article.image.header": "https://nyoobserver.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/gettyimages-483209392.jpg?quality=80&w=728&h=418&crop=1", "sailthru.tags": "2016 elections, Ben Carson, Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton, Jeb Bush, obsNews & Politics, obsPolitics", "sailthru.section": "News & Politics", "keywords": "2016 elections, ben carson, donald trump, hillary clinton, jeb bush", "sailthru.article.image.grid": "https://nyoobserver.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/gettyimages-483209392.jpg?quality=80&w=300&h=225&crop=1", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://observer.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/dac0f3722a48a53be75eb06c0c4f5119?s=16", "news_keywords": "%tags%", "generator": "WordPress.com", "msapplication-TileColor": "#2b5797", "sailthru.title": "The State of the 2016 Election", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "sailthru.byline_slug": "ashe-schow", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://nyoobserver.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/gettyimages-483209392.jpg?quality=80&w=50", "description": "Ben Carson, Jeb Bush and others see their campaigns struggling heading into the 2016 election.", "sailthru.byline_avatar_url": "https://nyoobserver.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/img_06061.jpg?quality=80&w=88", "msapplication-tooltip": "News, Politics, Culture, Art, Style, Real Estate, Movie Reviews, TV recaps", "fb": {"app_id": 132947390197809}, "sailthru.byline_twitter": "@AsheSchow", "msapplication-TileImage": "//s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/newyorkobserver-2014/images/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "msvalidate.01": "F8C89E25D5233224541B1BB9B10BF573", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/newyorkobserver", "published_time": "2016-01-05T23:47:22+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-01-05T23:49:02+00:00", "author": "http://observer.com/author/ashe-schow"}, "sailthru.description": "As we enter 2016, let's take a look at where each candidate stands in the presidential campaign.", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "og": {"site_name": "Observer", "description": "As we enter 2016, let\u2019s take a look at where each candidate stands in the presidential campaign.", "title": "The State of the 2016 Election", "url": "http://observer.com/2016/01/the-state-of-the-2016-election/", "image": {"width": 635, "identifier": "https://nyoobserver.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/gettyimages-483209392.jpg?quality=80", "height": 424}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "146b7f62998343012fae89709f3a8167"}, "sailthru.byline_bio": "Ashe Schow is a senior political columnist for the New York Observer and a commentary writer for the Washington Examiner.
