Ted Cruz (R-Texas) has been ruffling feathers since his arrival in Washington this year. Including some on his own side of the aisle.\n\nIn fact, according to a new profile in GQ magazine, the Texas senator has earned the intense dislike of Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.)\n\n\u201cHe f***ing hates Cruz,\u201d an adviser to Sen. McCain told GQ\u2019s Jason Zengerle. \u201cHe\u2019s just offended by his style.\u201d\n\nBut it appears that the contentious relationship cuts both ways. Cruz has his own words for the senior Arizona senator.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know a conservative who didn\u2019t feel embarrassed voting in 2006 or 2008,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cI think the Republican Party lost its way. We didn\u2019t stand for the principles we\u2019re supposed to believe in.\u201d\n\nRecall that McCain mocked Sens. Cruz and Rand Paul (R-Ky.) after the Kentucky senator\u2019s 13-hour filibuster over the White House\u2019s drone policy, referring to the two senators and those who agree with them as \u201cwackobirds.\u201d\n\nMore recently, McCain has criticized Cruz for his efforts to defund Obamacare, suggesting that attempts to do away with President Barack Obama\u2019s health care law are \u201cnot rational.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can tell you that in the U.S. Senate, will not repeal or defund Obamacare. We will not,\u201d McCain told CNN. \u201cAnd to think we can is not rational.\u201d\n\n\u2013\n\nFollow Becket Adams (@BecketAdams) on Twitter\n\nFeatured image", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30; polling-uri=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/1.xml; polling-uri2=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/2.xml; polling-uri3=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/3.xml; polling-uri4=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/4.xml", "application-name": "TheBlaze.com", "twitter": {"description": "Sen.
