According to a report from Minnesota Daily, a recent study suggests that using BMI to gauge overall health and fitness may not be the best method. Researchers say there are much more accurate measures for determining how healthy a person really is.\n\nThe study comes after a growing trend of employers using BMI to monitor their employee\u2019s health for the purpose of determining health insurance costs. As outlined in the Affordable Care Act, employers can charge workers with a high BMI (suggesting poor health) as much as 30 percent of their healthcare costs.\n\nA BMI is a proportional measure comparing a person\u2019s weight and height. The measure, however, fails to distinguish between body parts of different densities, and thus could provide an inaccurate measure of a person\u2019s overall health, depending on factors like the relative levels of bone, muscle, fat, and water mass as a part of a person\u2019s total weight.\n\nThe study, carried out by researchers at the University of California \u2013 Los Angeles, found that as many as 54 million Americans may have been wrongly classified as unhealthy. Furthermore, they estimated that 20.7 million people with a \u201cnormal\u201d BMI level were actually unhealthy.\n\nBecause BMI doesn\u2019t take into account other factors that contribute to weight loss, like exercise or diet, it shouldn\u2019t be taken seriously as a true signifier of a person\u2019s health. With such a wide margin of error, BMI begins to seem like a rather arbitrary calculation when determining how healthy a person is.\n\nThe authors argued that it is unethical to use such an inaccurate method to determine a person\u2019s overall health, especially when it could lead to unjust charges on their health insurance bills.\n\nA UCLA press release describing the details of the study can be found here.", "article_metadata": {"msvalidate.01": "31E0890F7132F0B18215D5C1EDE470FD", "robots": "noodp,noydir", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "A recent study suggests that this simple thing is much more important than maintaining a low BMI.\nAccording to a report from Minnesota Daily, a recent study suggests that using BMI to gauge overall health and fitness may not be the best method.\nThe study comes after a growing trend of employers using BMI to monitor their employee\u2019s health for the purpose of determining health insurance costs.\nA BMI is a proportional measure comparing a person\u2019s weight and height.\nThe authors argued that it is unethical to use such an inaccurate method to determine a person\u2019s overall health, especially when it could lead to unjust charges on their health insurance bills."}
