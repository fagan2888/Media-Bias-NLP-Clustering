I really tried my best to recover and be ready to play, but unfortunately I still need more time to do the rehabilitation. I look forward to hopefully coming next year and being healthy. Hopefully in a week, I can start hitting balls. It's still too fresh and too risky at the moment to be playing at a high level. And if I'm going to go on court, I'm going to play 100% and I want to show my best. Under this condition, I can not do that so I'm really disappointed. I'm sad that I won't be able to play in front of so many fans that I have here.\"\n\nSince she withdrew prior to a schedule being released, her position in the draw is taken by the 13th seed, Irina-Camelia Begu. The next player to be seeded, Eugenie Bouchard, will take the vacated 13th seed position and a qualifier or lucky loser takes the position created by this move.\n\nPetra Cetkovska has also withdrawn with a right thigh injury, but as she is not seeded her position will be filled by a qualifier or lucky loser.\n\nRESULTS - APRIL 03, 2016\n\nWomen's\n\nQualifying Singles - Second Round\n\nQualifying - [1] E.
