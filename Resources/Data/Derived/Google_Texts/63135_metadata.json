The move to let state regulators take temporary control of the CO-OP would have canceled as many as 17,000 individual policies. But CMS said the state's plan would have violated the Affordable Care Act's mandate that all policies be renewed, according to the article.\n\nThe CO-OP, Community Health Options, lost $31 million in 2015, though previously it had been one of the rare success stories. Given its losses, some have criticized salary increases awarded to its top executives.
