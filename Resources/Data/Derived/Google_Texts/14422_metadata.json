First, on Oct. 6, Walmart said it would begin working with DirectHealth.com, an online health insurance agency, to help shoppers compare coverage options and sign up for Medicare or plans on the Affordable Care Act exchanges. The very next day, Walmart stated it would cut health insurance for 30,000 part-time workers and raise premiums for its full-time employees, effective Jan. 1.\n\nAlison Griswold Alison Griswold is a Slate staff writer covering business and economics.\n\nWalmart is among several retailers racing to make a name for itself in the nearly $3 trillion U.S. health care market. And, in many ways, it\u2019s already proven to be a leader. In 2006, Walmart introduced its $4 prescription program, which cut the cost of roughly 300 generic drugs to $4 for a 30-day supply. It has dozens of simple-service clinics that test for common ailments and provide vaccinations, and this year has focused on rolling out a handful of primary care facilities that charge $40 per visit in Texas, South Carolina, and Georgia. The partnership with DirectHealth.com is a logical next step in Walmart\u2019s push into wellness\u2014a perk that might help draw consumers into Walmart\u2019s stores and build their trust in its brand for not just cheap groceries, but also cheap health services.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to know if the advance of Walmart and other retailers will actually decrease health care spending.\n\nAt the same time, Walmart\u2019s interest in building faith in its health offerings does not extend to its own employees. It made that much clear when it slashed benefits and raised premiums the day after publicizing its DirectHealth.com initiative. People are already sensitive when it comes to health services. Should they trust a giant corporation to handle them, especially one that appears to be so callous about the health care of its own employees?\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThe simple answer, health policy experts say, is yes. \u201cConsumers are going to benefit from new entrants who think more like retailers than health care providers,\u201d says Zack Cooper, professor of health policy and management at the Yale School of Public Health. \u201cIf I had one word to describe Walmart coming in, it would be cool.\u201d The influx of retailers like Walmart into health care means that consumers are suddenly getting more information about and access to crucial services. While many doctor\u2019s offices are used to operating from 9 to 5, Cooper says that retailers are starting to extend those hours. Walmart\u2019s new primary care clinics are open from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. during the week and for slightly shorter hours on Saturday and Sunday; CVS\u2019s Minute Clinics run on similar schedules.\n\nThe DirecHealth.com partnership should also be a useful tool for people struggling to navigate the exchanges and healthcare.gov. \u201cWhen people choose insurance plans, they have a hard time because the information is so complex,\u201d says Ateev Mehrotra, professor of health care policy and medicine at Harvard Medical School. \u201cA lot of times patients are not choosing the best plan for them.\u201d The DirectHealth.com agents stationed in Walmart\u2019s stores will make the same commission on all policies they sell, a Walmart spokesperson said, meaning there are no incentives to steer customers toward more expensive options. \u201cFor consumers, more information from a trusted source is better,\u201d Cooper says.\n\nIn April, PricewaterhouseCoopers wrote in a report on the health industry that consumers \u201care ready to abandon traditional care models for ones that echo experiences in banking, retail, and entertainment.\u201d Nearly 50 percent of people surveyed told PwC they would be likely to have a wound treated at a clinic in a retail store or pharmacy, or have stitches removed there, if it cost less than the traditional option of a hospital or physician\u2019s office. Fifty-nine percent said they would be interested in using an at-home strep test.\n\nThen again, health policy is rarely simple. It\u2019s hard to know if the advance of Walmart and other retailers like CVS (which rebranded as CVS Health in September), Target, and Walgreens will actually decrease health care spending. \u201cThe more you make health care accessible and the easier it is for people to touch the health care system, the more that they\u2019re probably going to consume,\u201d Cooper explains. The economic term for this is induced demand: Make it cheaper and easier for patients to seek treatment, and they\u2019re more likely to do so. At the same time, Walmart and its peers are offering a potentially valuable addition to the U.S. primary care system\u2014bridging a gap between problems that can\u2019t or shouldn\u2019t wait for a visit to the doctor\u2019s office and issues that require a trip to the emergency room. \u201cYou see a lot of innovation historically in healthcare at the high [cost] end,\u201d Cooper says. \u201cThose are the big-ticket items; that\u2019s where pharma is focused.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.subheadline": "Health care services for customers?
