More curious still, both have presented their hard-won insights in the great American tradition of positive thinking. Like so many aphorists-on-the-make before them, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama entered the marketplace of ideas selling tidy homilies on the very same concept: Hope.\n\nThen again, perhaps there is something more to all this than coincidence. Maybe this high-minded creed and these two presidents\u2019 fecklessness actually complement and explain one another. Maybe \u201chope\u201d is the ideal philosophical doctrine for a party determined to dump its old constituents and chart a brave new course in a marketized world. As a slogan, \u201chope\u201d is vague and ethereal\u2014as opposed to former, more earthly Democratic concepts like \u201cshared prosperity\u201d and \u201cequal rights for all\u201d\u2014but perhaps that is what makes it the consummate brand identity for a party that so often triangulates away the concerns of its rank and file.\n\n*\n\n\u201cHope\u201d is a noble word, one of the three so-called theological virtues mentioned in the Apostle Paul\u2019s First Epistle to the Corinthians. It has a very particular meaning for Christians, who use \u201chope\u201d to describe their expectation of salvation. Once upon a time it meant something similar for Marxists, too, who counted on the swift arrival of a more earthly rapture. \u201cThe driving force of revolution is\u2014hope,\u201d says one character to another in Andr\u00e9 Malraux\u2019s 1937 iconic novel of the Spanish Civil War, \u201cMan\u2019s Hope.\u201d\n\nWhat Democrats mean by the word is not quite so world-transforming. To them it is more of a personal attribute. The way Bill Clinton talked about \u201chope\u201d in 1992 it was a fairly simple deal: He had it, the other guy didn\u2019t. America under George Bush Senior was suffering a sort of hope drought, and if he, Bill Clinton, were to become president, hope would be restored to the parched fields of the Republic. The election, he said in a campaign video, was basically a hope referendum; it \u201cpresents America with a very stark choice: a choice between hope and fear.\u201d In a video called \u201cThe Man From Hope\u201d (Clinton was born in Hope, Ark.), which was shown at the Democratic convention, the candidate recited a hope list: He hoped he could improve himself every day, he hoped the nation would achieve togetherness, and finally he confided his hope that every American would come to love the children of America. Perhaps recognizing how vacuous all this must have sounded, Clinton proceeded to the inevitable corollary of all Democratic hope-talk: that these run-of-the-mill wishes were in fact a little bit bold. \u201cI still believe these things are possible,\u201d he intoned. \u201cI still believe in the promise of America. And I still believe in a place called Hope.\u201d\n\nIn 1996, Clinton ran on the solid record he had built as a hope-restorer. In his speech to the Democratic Convention that year, he told how he had traveled among the common people of the land and learned \u201cthat hope is back in America. We are on the right track to the 21st century.\u201d The president also settled back into his Oval Office easy chair to take careful account of the many imaginary mysteries and fatuous syllogisms that vex the true believer in this empty concept. What he seemed to conclude, to judge by his campaign book for that year, \u201cBetween Hope and History,\u201d was that hope was the opposite of everything that was bad, particularly \u201cfear\u201d but also \u201chatred\u201d; and that, having understood hope to be so very good, not to mention on the side of history itself, we ought to follow its dictates wherever they led us. Then he enumerated those objectives, many of which he had already achieved and others which were sure to come: Balanced budgets, NAFTA, Empowerment Zones, and telecom deregulation.\n\nHistory has often presented America with the choices of hope over fear, of lofty vision over adversity. In every age, Americans are required to meet the challenges history presents us and, as we do, to keep faith with both the values upon which our nation was founded and the hopes and dreams upon which people build their lives.\n\nWhew! After wading through 178 pages of meringue like that, the hope-talk of Barack Obama comes as a positive relief. Compared to Bill Clinton, Obama is a poet. In his hands the old platitude sings. He can spin the null concept of hope into oratory to rival Pericles.\n\nObama\u2019s definition of the cherished cliche is slightly different, however. In his 2006 memoir, \u201cThe Audacity of Hope,\u201d he identified \u201chope\u201d as a sort of absence of cynicism, a belief that government can do good in the world. He often elaborated on this uninteresting view in his electrifying campaign speeches. In one memorable 2008 appearance before a throng of the faithful in Rhode Island, he defined hope as \u201cThat sense that we can make America better.\u201d \u201cNothing worthwhile in this country\u2019s ever happened,\u201d he continued, \u201cexcept somebody, somewhere was willing to hope.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Barack Obama and Bill Clinton both peddled a diet of hope.
