Where we make our income is through coal miners,\u201d said Ms. Venzke, whose husband, Ryan, works as a miner in the nearby Twentymile Mine. \u201cIf we don\u2019t have their support, we as a liquor store wouldn\u2019t be here either.\u201d\n\nShe\u2019s not the only one. About a dozen liquor retailers are participating in the Yampa Valley beer boycott, part of a regional uprising of residents, business owners and elected officials fighting to save the Colowyo Mine, an economic backbone of the rural community in the remote far northwestern corner of the state.\n\n\u201cI have 12 holes on my shelves right now because of them supporting WildEarth Guardians,\u201d said Lori Gillam, who owns Stockmen\u2019s Liquor. \u201cWildEarth Guardians has said they want to ban coal \u2014 they want it gone \u2014 and we\u2019re a coal-mining town. It\u2019s important for us to support the people who support us and not the people who want to destroy our community.\u201d\n\nThe backlash kicked in after U.S. District Court Judge R. Brooke Jackson ruled May 8 in WildEarth Guardians\u2018 favor, concluding that the Interior Department\u2019s office of surface mining fell short in its 2007 permit allowing the mine to expand by failing to provide enough public notice or take into account the impact on air quality.\n\nThe judge gave the federal agency 120 days to bring the permit into compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act. The problem is that virtually nobody thinks that 120 days is enough time.\n\n\u201cI believe that public involvement and compliance with NEPA are fundamental to federal agencies like OSM making informed decisions concerning federal resources,\u201d said a statement by Colorado Department of Natural Resources Director Mike King.\n\n\u201cHowever, the court has provided an unrealistically short time frame to remedy a complicated NEPA process; threatening a mine shut-down on a federal permitting decision that has been in place for eight years and that Colowyo has been implementing during that time is an unacceptable result,\u201d he said.\n\nTri-State Generation and Transmission, the rural energy co-op that owns the Colowyo Mine, has filed for a stay pending an appeal, but without that hold, it\u2019s likely the mine will be forced to close, at least temporarily.\n\nA shutdown would be devastating not just for miners but also for the region. The coal mine brings an estimated $200 million to the struggling rural area, along with $12 million in local, state and federal tax revenue, according to Tri-State.\n\nWildEarth Guardians\u2018 Jeremy Nichols insists that his group isn\u2019t the villain.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s this impression that we sued Colowyo. We sued the federal government for breaking the law, which is something that should be a concern for every American citizen,\u201d Mr. Nichols said.\n\nWildEarth Guardians declared in a statement last month that the Tri-State plant, which provides electricity to 1.5 million rural customers, emits \u201cnearly 9 million tons of carbon pollution every year, making it one of the largest single sources of greenhouse gases in Colorado.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think people in Craig should be marching up to the Interior Department right now and telling them to get the job done right,\u201d Mr. Nichols said. \u201cThey should take into account the environmental impacts of coal mining and ensure the American public that as they authorize the mining of publicly owned coal, that they\u2019re doing it with their eyes wide open and ensuring that they\u2019re making the best decision.\u201d\n\nAbout 900 people packed the Moffat County High School auditorium for a June 3 community meeting on how to combat the closure, at which local elected officials and Tri-State CEO Mike McInnes vowed to fight for the mine\u2019s survival.\n\n\u201cThis commodity that we \u2014 you and I and all of us \u2014 produce that is so essential to life, and the lifestyle we want, continues to face challenges on every front,\u201d said Mr. McInnes. \u201cAnd I\u2019m telling you, this isn\u2019t the last one we\u2019re going to face. We have got a lot of them, and we\u2019re going to take on every one of them as we come to them. But we need your help.\u201d\n\nBrewers react\n\nAt least two of the breweries targeted by the boycott have been quick to distance themselves from any \u201cwar on coal.\u201d Terry Usry, a spokesman for Breckenridge Brewery, said the company\u2019s name appeared on WildEarth Guardians\u2018 online \u201cBusinesses for Guardians\u201d list after an employee donated a $30 gift card for a 2011 fundraiser.\n\n\u201cAs soon as this story came to our attention, we contacted WildEarth Guardians and asked that they remove Breckenridge Brewery from their list of supporters, and they immediately complied,\u201d Mr. Usry said in an email.\n\nHe added that the WildEarth Guardians fundraiser had nothing to do with the Colowyo or Trapper coal mines, and that since then, \u201c[W]e have had no other involvement with WildEarth Guardians.\u201d\n\nBryan Simpson, a spokesman for New Belgium Brewing, said the brewery has donated more than $9,000 to WildEarth Guardians since 2008 but that the funding was directed toward \u201crestoration projects along the Colorado River,\u201d not the anti-coal campaign.\n\n\u201cSpecific to any work WildEarth Guardians has done regarding the Colowyo and Trapper mines, we were unaware of it at the time and that is outside the scope of our grant allocations,\u201d said a New Belgium statement. \u201cIn this case, our funding dollars were allocated for healthy watershed projects only, and no money was given to overturn mining operations. Additionally, we have never granted operational funds to Wild Earth Guardians and we have no future funding plans at this time.\u201d\n\nSeveral New Belgium representatives drove to Moffat County last week to interview about 12 liquor store owners participating in the boycott.\n\n\u201cWe listened to heartfelt stories and heard people\u2019s take on the industry and our philanthropic efforts,\u201d Mr. Simpson said in an email. \u201cWe\u2019re turning all that information over to our philanthropy committee for review and to inform our process going forward. The visit only amplified the respect and appreciation we all feel for the people of Craig.\u201d\n\nLocal liquor retailers aren\u2019t the only ones lining up to fight to preserve the mine. Frank and Kerry Moe say fully 60 percent of the traffic at their Best Western hotel stems from mine-related business.\n\n\u201cAren\u2019t there more of us than there are of these fringe groups?\u201d Ms. Moe asked at the public meeting. \u201cCan\u2019t we all band together? Can\u2019t all the power plants band together and all the coal miners band together and, once and for all, stop this nonsense and make it go away for good?\u201d\n\nEnvironmental groups aren\u2019t the only threats to coal. The industry took a hit with the Obama administration\u2019s recent emissions restrictions on coal-fired plants while falling natural gas prices have driven reductions in coal production by making gas-fired plants more competitive.\n\nCoal emits more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere than natural gas, but Colorado coal producers point out that their product is relatively low in sulfur, meaning that it burns cleaner than other coal. Colorado ranks as the nation\u2019s 11th-largest coal producer and coal provides 64 percent of the state\u2019s electricity, according to the Colorado Mining Association.\n\n\u201c[E]verybody that has a logical mind understands that coal is the basis of electricity in the country and it\u2019s the basis of reliability and the basis of affordable electricity,\u201d Mr. McInnes said.\n\nThe little community of Craig has received bipartisan support from Democrats including Gov. John Hickenlooper and Sen. Michael Bennet as well as Republican Sen. Cory Gardner and Rep. Scott Tipton, all of whom have asked Interior Secretary Sally Jewell to consider filing an appeal.\n\nAt the public meeting, Mr. McInnes urged residents to submit as many comments to the OSM as possible before Monday\u2019s deadline.\n\nHe also implored the crowd to stay classy. \u201cOne of the things that I\u2019m really proud of is the way in which this community has handled this unfortunate situation, with class and dignity,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t need to be abrasive,\u201d Mr. McInnes said. \u201cWe don\u2019t need to be combative. This is a very irrational thing that is going on, and I\u2019m asking you to be the rational voice in this.\u201d\n\nIn the meantime, fans of New Belgium\u2019s Fat Tire amber ale will have to look elsewhere for their favorite beverage or try some of the other brews that Ms. Venzke has brought in to fill the void.\n\nFar from being upset, she said, her customers are \u201cactually happy\u201d about her decision to join the beer boycott.\n\n\u201cThis is a very tight-knit community,\u201d Ms. Venzke said. \u201cThey don\u2019t want us obviously supporting something that\u2019s going to potentially put them and their family members and friends out of work.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Jana Venzke is fighting the war on coal here in northwest Colorado -- one bottle of craft beer at a time.
