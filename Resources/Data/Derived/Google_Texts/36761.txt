A south Topeka standoff ends after more than four hours - but not until officers broke out tear gas and battering rams. Officers arrested 25-year-old Jesse Marett after the gas drove him from his home shortly before 11:00 p.m. on Friday.

Marett is a wanted felon.

They first arrived at the complex, in the 3000 block of SW Lydia Court, near Gage Blvd., around 7:30 p.m. after someone reported a domestic disturbance. They discovered Marett was inside, and after attempting to make contact, Marett barricaded the door and refused to come out. SWAT arrived soon thereafter. Officers surrounded the building and began negotiating with Marett through a window and on the phone.

After four hours of communication, Marett still refused to come out.

Battering rams were brought out around 10:30 p.m. and were soon followed by a barrage of of tear gas so thick people in the parking lot reportedly were affected.

Marett eventually came out of the apartment onto a balcony where he was taken into custody and booked into the Shawnee County Department of Corrections for the felony warrant.
