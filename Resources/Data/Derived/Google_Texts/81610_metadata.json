(Photo by Suzanne Sproul)\n\nKids Come First is a pediatric community health center that has been helping children and families in need for years. The work done there quietly goes unnoticed by many and its new executive director wants to change that.\n\nThe clinic maintains a committed and loyal following of supporters who give their time and financial donations, but as grants become more difficult to secure and the need for services continues to rise, more needs to be done, according to Cynthia Prendiz. She worked alongside longtime executive director Beverly Speak before she retired. Prendiz now heads the clinic administration.\n\n\u201cWe are looking for community support and engagement and we look forward to doing more,\" Prendiz said.\n\nIn fact, she is working to schedule casual and fun community gatherings to help change that. One was held recently at the Chaffey Community Museum of Art. The evening brought together old friends of the clinic along with new ones, all in the lovely historic confines of the downtown Ontario museum. Guests enjoyed drinks and appetizers while surrounded by beautiful art. Proceeds went to the clinic.\n\n\u201cThe idea was to have an evening where we could get together and talk about what we do and how the community can help. It is an opportunity for partnerships and relationships. The Chaffey Community Museum of Art is another longtime local nonprofit and our board thought it was a great idea to work together,\" she said.\n\nRon Wolff retired as executive director of OPARC but wanted to stay connected to the community. He now serves on the clinic board.\n\n\u201cThe clinic is important because every child deserves high quality medical care from a provider that truly cares about each patient\u2019s overall health. Even with recent changes in the law that relate to insurance coverage (specifically, the Affordable Care Act), not all providers accept Medi-Cal. Kids Come First does accept Medi-Cal, so it plays a vital role in the south Ontario community, regardless of the family\u2019s ability to pay. Without Kids Come First, some children would simply go without medical care for anything other than life-threatening illness,\" Wolff said.\n\nKids Come First has established a strong bond of trust with many families in the community throughout the years. It subsists on minimal financial support, mostly from insurance, and welcomes contributions of any size from caring members of the community, he said.

Canyon Hills Junior High received the junior high trophy for the most pages read at that grade level and also was the junior high champion last year.\n\nChildren\u2019s Fund and Auto Club Speedway partner for students \u2014 Children\u2019s Fund and Auto Club Speedway are joining the race to help foster children across San Bernardino County by conducting a Lefty\u2019s Backpack Drive. The month-long program kicked off this week and race fans who donate a backpack and/or school supplies will receive a $10 discount voucher toward a ticket purchase to the upcoming MAVTV 500 Indy Car race on June 27.\n\n\u201cAuto Club Speedway hosts year-round programs benefiting our local youth,\u201d said Auto Club Speedway president Dave Allen. \u201cThis backpack drive is a cool way to provide students with the tools they need to succeed in school, and we have thousands of race fans who can help with this great cause.\u201d\n\nDonations can be dropped off at the Speedway\u2019s administration office, 9300 Cherry Ave., Fontana, now through June 26 from 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Suggestions are new backpacks, scientific calculators, three-ring binders with 200 notebook sheets and 200 sheets of construction paper with a box of 24-count crayons.
