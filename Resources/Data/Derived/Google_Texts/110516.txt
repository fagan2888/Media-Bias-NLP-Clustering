Bill O'Reilly went after two of his favorite foes on Wednesday: Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert.

He said that the hosts are in the business of going after conservatives to entertain their liberal audiences. "They prop up the Democratic party and the liberal line, President Obama, Biden â€” denigrating their opposition, the Republican party, conservative people."

He asked "Media Buzz" host Howard Kurtz and contributor Lauren Ashburn whether it gets "more difficult to do that with the Democratic party are descending in the court of public opinion."

Kurtz claimed that it does and that the hosts' jokes about Obama are "gentle." Ashburn, however, disagreed. She said that the hosts took on the IRS scandal, the botched rollout of Obamacare and the situation in Iraq.

"They went hard on Obama," she argued.

O'Reilly scoffed. "Colbert very rarely does," he replied. "Stewart, I have to say as we just saw, will poke, will poke. But their core audience... are liberal, Democrats under 40."

"They smoke a little pot, okay, they drink a little wine," he added.

Ashburn countered that those viewers still count in the ratings. "They are higher than any show on CNN or MSNBC," she said, to which O'Reilly had no comment.
