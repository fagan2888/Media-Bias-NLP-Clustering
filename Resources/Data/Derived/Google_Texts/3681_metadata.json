And the Senate has scheduled a repeat vote on Tuesday, trying to bait any wavering Democrats to switch their position.\n\nSenate Democratic leaders said they were confident their ranks would hold. But there was some exasperation as they recognized that they would be in for a protracted battle, at least through the 2016 presidential and congressional elections and possibly beyond.\n\n\u201cThis highlights one of the great problems we have wrestled with over the last couple of years, which is nothing is ever over,\u201d said Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, the senior Democrat on the House Select Committee on Intelligence. \u201cWe used to have political fights and when they were done, you moved on to the next fight. But unfortunately in today\u2019s climate nothing is ever over. It\u2019s re-litigated constantly.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOn Friday, House Republicans began venting their rage by forcing Democrats to vote on a resolution approving the Iran agreement rather than on the long-anticipated measure disapproving the accord \u2014 a maneuver intended to show how little support the deal had in the Republican-controlled chamber, and to force Democrats to be on record in backing the agreement.\n\nSpeaker John A. Boehner, Republican of Ohio, denounced the deal, offering a long litany of how it would fail to achieve goals promised by President Obama, including stopping Iran from developing a nuclear weapon.\n\n\u201cThis is all without Iran cheating,\u201d Mr. Boehner said. \u201cThat\u2019s right, this is such a bad deal the ayatollah won\u2019t even have to cheat to be steps away from a nuclear weapon.\u201d\n\nShortly after Mr. Boehner\u2019s floor speech, House Republicans added the exclamation point: The measure in support of the Iran deal failed with 244 Republicans and 25 Democrats voting against it and 162 Democrats in favor.\n\nWhile the vote certainly demonstrated Republican opposition, it also showed the success of a concerted effort by Democratic leaders to build support for the Iran deal. The 162 Democrats in favor was comfortably above the 146 needed to sustain a presidential veto in the event that Republicans had managed to pass legislation rejecting the accord. In the Senate, Democrats also have a comfortable margin to sustain a veto.\n\nIran Nuclear Deal\n\nHouse Republicans also approved a measure barring Mr. Obama from easing sanctions against Iran, which is a core component of the deal.\n\nUnder the agreement, which was negotiated by the United States, Britain, China, France, Germany and Russia, Iran is to gain some relief from sanctions in exchange for greater international oversight, and new restrictions, on its nuclear program.\n\nThe bill, which bars the easing of sanctions until the day after Mr. Obama leaves office, was approved by a vote of 247 to 186, with just two Democrats joining 245 Republicans in favor. All 186 opposed were Democrats.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nRepublican aides and strategists said that they viewed their opposition to the Iran deal quite similarly to their opposition to Mr. Obama\u2019s heath care overhaul. In the case of the Iran issue, they said there was even more reason to continue pressing the case given that some Democrats were also against the deal. On health care, by contrast, Democrats had been united behind the president.\n\nRepresentative Peter Roskam, Republican of Illinois, a fierce critic of the accord, said that easing sanctions on Iran would allow it to increase its financing of terrorists.\n\n\u201cThe bill itself gives $150 billion in sanctions relief to the Iranian government,\u201d Mr. Roskam said. \u201cThen the question is what do we expect from $150 billion. Is it all going to go to pave roads? Is it going to go build schools in Tehran? Is it going to fix water systems? I don\u2019t think so.\u201d\n\nSpeaking to reporters this week, Mr. Roskam said he was also leaving open the possibility of a lawsuit aimed at forcing the White House to provide the text of separate agreements between Iran and the International Atomic Energy Agency.\n\nRepublicans, including Mr. Roskam, expressed confidence that the American public was on their side, and that Mr. Obama and Democrats would be held accountable for Iran\u2019s conduct in the Middle East and beyond once the deal was put in place.\n\nDemocrats, meanwhile, said the Republicans were engaged in a futile exercise. Senator Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, the No. 2 Democrat, snickered at the prospect of Republican lawsuits. \u201cMaybe they decided to take a breather on suits on the Affordable Care Act to file some new lawsuits against this administration,\u201d he said at the Capitol on Thursday. \u201cThey are sure keeping the lawyers busy.\u201d\n\nMr. Obama, in a statement, said, \u201cToday\u2019s vote in the House of Representatives is the latest indication that the more members have studied the historic deal that will prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon, the more they have come out in support of it.\u201d\n\nRepresentative Nancy Pelosi of California, the Democratic leader, urged support for the Iran accord in a speech on the House floor, saying it offered the best chance of slowing Iran\u2019s development of a nuclear weapon.\n\n\u201cIf the deal is rejected by America, the Iranians could have a nuclear weapon within a year,\u201d Ms. Pelosi said. \u201cThe choice is stark.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20150911125603, "twitter": {"description": "The House rejected the deal overwhelmingly, along partisan lines, as congressional Republicans showed no sign of letting up in their effort to pressure the White House.", "creator": "herszenhorn", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/12/world/middleeast/iran-nuclear-deal-house.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003904326"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "title": "House Rejects Iran Nuclear Deal", "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/09/12/world/CONG/CONG-thumbLarge.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/12/world/middleeast/iran-nuclear-deal-house.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003904326", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/12/world/middleeast/iran-nuclear-deal-house.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "world/middleeast", "hdl_p": "Partisan Vote in House Rejects Pact With Iran", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/world/middleeast/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "Sept. 11, 2015", "edt": "NewYork", "article": {"author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/h/david_m_herszenhorn/index.html", "section_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/pages/world/index.html", "section": "Middle East", "modified": "2015-11-18", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/world/middleeast/index.jsonp", "tag": "House of Representatives", "published": "2015-09-11", "section-taxonomy-id": "9A43D8FC-F4CF-44D9-9B34-138D30468F8F"}, "keywords": "United States Politics and Government,Nuclear Weapons,Iran,Presidential Election of 2016,Law and Legislation,House of Representatives", "description": "The House rejected the deal overwhelmingly, along partisan lines, as congressional Republicans showed no sign of letting up in their effort to pressure the White House.", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "David M.
