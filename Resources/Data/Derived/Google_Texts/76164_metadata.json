There\u2019s room for parking, and birds can be heard some days, tweeting merrily from the trees that circle the area.\n\nThe well-kept residential building in one of Mississippi\u2019s poorest and most remote communities was meant to provide affordable housing to attract sorely needed teachers to the area \u2013 at least, that\u2019s the vision the state\u2019s lawmakers once had 17 years ago, when they allocated $200,000 for it as part of the Mississippi Critical Teacher Shortage Act of 1998. State leaders heralded the sweeping law as a forceful response to the teacher shortage, and teachers initially moved in.\n\nThese days, however, no teachers live in the duplex, according to the district, which still struggles mightily to recruit and retain teachers to an area with few stores, restaurants and amenities. Instead, the building has become a symbol of an idea that failed in Mississippi, although it has been taken up in other states, which are now building housing teachers can afford to live in.\n\n\u201cIf you are going to talk about housing, you have to talk about what else is here \u2014 where people go when they aren\u2019t working \u2026 It\u2019d be nice to have an Applebee\u2019s or Starbucks but of course that\u2019s not where we are right now.\u201d Fletcher Harges, principal at Marshall Elementary School in Carrollton, Mississippi\n\nBefore the housing was approved, former West Tallahatchie Superintendent Reggie Barnes, an outspoken advocate for the state\u2019s most impoverished schools, told Mississippi Department of Education officials that districts like his struggled to help teachers find housing. According to Tracy Mims, a current school board member and mayor of Webb, a local real estate developer received the sum for building the duplex, and then paid the loan back over several years at reduced interest rates, as required by state law.\n\n\u201cIt was something we were very hopeful about at the time,\u201d said Mims, who has lived across the street from the duplex for more than 14 years. \u201cIt sounded like it would give teachers a chance to participate more in the community \u2014 to really be here and be engaged.\u201d\n\nWhen the apartments opened, top priority was to be given to teachers working in the district, and then to other licensed school district employees, according to the law. Other school district staff were to be given third-tier priority. After that, the apartments could be rented to anyone able to pay.\n\nInitially, teachers filled the apartment complex, according to Mims. But through the years, as teachers moved out, more non-teachers started to move in. And if a tenant moved out during the school year, there often weren\u2019t any teachers \u2014 who tend to relocate before school starts in early August \u2014 ready to move in. Mims said he recalls the rent \u2014 about $400 a month \u2014 being regarded as a bit high for the community in the late 90s.\n\nIn the end, instead of being an exciting recruitment tool, the duplex has been filled in recent years by people with no direct ties to the school system.\n\nAnd the rural district, located about a 30-minute drive from Clarksdale, still finds it hard to attract and keep teachers.\n\nHousing is just part of the problem, although \u2014 as in many rural districts \u2014 few homes are available for rent, and many of those that are for sale need major work. The district has other woes. It currently rates a D on the state\u2019s A to F accountability system, which uses test scores and other data to assign letter-grade scores to school districts. Teachers are further deterred by the lack of grocery stores, restaurants and shops in the town, which has about 565 people, according to 2010 Census data\n\nAlthough the idea of creating apartments for teachers has not panned out for West Tallahatchie, it is now catching on in other states and districts, where teachers struggle to find suitable housing, either because it isn\u2019t readily available or because it is too expensive. Apartments specifically for teachers and other district employees have been completed in Newark, New Jersey and in pricey, tourist-driven areas on the Outer Banks in North Carolina. Similar apartments are under construction in the high-cost market of Los Angeles, and the Oakland Unified School District in California is considering a teacher apartment proposal.\n\n565 \u2014 Population of Webb, Mississippi, in rural Tallahatchie County, an area that struggles to attract teachers to its schools.\n\nIn rural McDowell County, West Virginia, a group of nonprofits and companies spearheaded by the American Federation of Teachers recently purchased land to build a teacher village, hoping to provide the type of community that the West Tallahatchie district sought to create with its duplex, and to bring in more teachers with the promise of good, inexpensive housing.\n\nLeaders in those states might learn some lessons from West Tallahatchie, including the fact that recreation and other amenities matter, and that teachers usually need both low rent and move-in dates that accommodate their schedules.\n\nThe offer of decent housing was not enough to overcome the isolation and challenges of the district, which in late September still had three openings, including two elementary posts and one high school position. In recent years, the district hasn\u2019t even tried to use it as a draw: The district\u2019s superintendent of two years didn\u2019t even know the location of the duplex until he researched it.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t really call it a tool at all, honestly,\u201d said Superintendent Darron Edwards, \u201cWe don\u2019t have a connection to it, and we don\u2019t necessarily know when they have vacancies to fill.\u201d\n\nThe units all appeared to be occupied on a mild, sunny day in mid-September a grill was located outside one unit, a pink scooter outside another, and a crated brown-and-black puppy sat outside a third unit\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s still mostly professionals and some blue collar workers,\u201d said Mims, who believes the last teacher moved out about eight years ago. \u201cBut it\u2019s not really serving the purpose it was built for anymore.\u201d\n\nRelated: Is consolidation the answer for Mississippi\u2019s struggling schools?\n\nCarroll County teacher Barbara Miller says she is happy to make a 30-minute commute to teach.\n\nInstead, teachers found housing in other places where rent was cheaper and amenities like stores and restaurants and activities were closer, Mims added.\n\nBarbara Miller, a second-year elementary teacher in Carroll County, another remote Mississippi Delta area where housing is tough to find and about half of teachers commute distances of 25 minutes or more, said she could see the appeal of housing close to school.\n\nBut she said her family ties and her husband\u2019s job mean it makes more sense for her to live farther from her work, and commute to her job at Marshall Elementary in Carrollton.\n\n\u201cI think there are a lot of things people consider when they decide where to live, and it\u2019s about more than where your job is. It can be a complicated decision,\u201d she said. \u201cBut driving isn\u2019t a problem for me. I love the way this school district is like a family and a community. We do great things for children. I would be willing to drive a very long way to get here.\u201d\n\nMiller\u2019s principal, Fletcher Harges, makes the 30-minute drive from Grenada and says that a lack of entertainment and shopping in Carrollton are definitely factors in his decision to live away from where he works. The town has one restaurant and no grocery stores. There is only a Dollar General where residents can buy some basic supplies.\n\n\u201cIf you are going to talk about housing, you have to talk about what else is here \u2014 where people go when they aren\u2019t working,\u201d Harges said with a smile. \u201cIt\u2019d be nice to have an Applebee\u2019s or Starbucks but of course that\u2019s not where we are right now.\u201d\n\nRelated: Full court press for Mississippi third graders in summer school has disappointing results\n\nTo boost the appeal of teacher housing, some developers, like those in Newark, New Jersey, are heavily promoting recreation opportunities and amenities.\n\n\u201cIf you aren\u2019t from an area like this \u2014 if this isn\u2019t what you know and what you are comfortable with, you are probably going to make the choice to be in an area where there is more for you to do.\u201d Darron Edwards, superintendent of the West Tallahatchie school district\n\nTeachers who live in the complex there have access to gyms and other recreational spaces at the school when the school isn\u2019t in use. The airy apartments also have upgrades like stainless steel appliances, wood flooring and quartz countertops.\n\nThe idea, according to promotional materials for the complex, is to give teachers a place to live near work, and also provide them with ample opportunities to both network and socialize with teachers and other professionals.\n\nMeanwhile, West Tallahatchie\u2019s superintendent, Edwards, said he understands why many of his teachers choose to make the 25-minute drive from Clarksdale \u2014 or to make an even longer commute \u2014 to his district.\n\n\u201cIf you aren\u2019t from an area like this \u2014 if this isn\u2019t what you know and what you are comfortable with, you are probably going to make the choice to be in an area where there is more for you to do \u2014 a place that has some restaurants, and where you don\u2019t have to drive 20 miles or more to get basic necessities.\u201d\n\nThis story was produced by The Hechinger Report, a nonprofit, independent news organization focused on inequality and innovation in education.
