Vitamin D deficiency increases by a factor of seven, the risk of poor brain function following cardiac arrest, according to new research presented by Dr. Jin Wi at the annual meeting of the Acute Cardiovascular Care Association. Lack of the necessary amount of vitamin D also decreased a patient's likelihood of surviving.\n\nThe Marriage of Sun and Skin\n\nYour body makes vitamin D from sunlight on your skin. Only a small amount comes from food, including eggs and oily fish, such as salmon, sardines, and mackerel. However, you can also get vitamin D in the form of supplements. No matter how you absorb this important vitamin, your body must convert it first before it can be used to manage the amount of calcium in your blood and bones and to help cells communicate properly. Vitamin D is necessary to strengthen immunity and to support muscles, heart, lungs, and brain health.\n\n\u201cWe investigated the association of vitamin D deficiency with neurologic outcome after sudden cardiac arrest,\" Wi said. He and his team began this investigation by analyzing clinical data from all unconscious patients resuscitated from sudden cardiac arrest at a hospital in Seoul, Korea. The study included 53 patients. CPR had been performed on 41 patients (77 percent). Heart rhythm was shockable in 36 patients (68 percent) and non-shockable in 17 patients (32 percent). The average vitamin D level was 10.3 ng/mL and 31 patients (59 percent) were found to be deficient.\n\nAmong those patients with a poor outcome, the researchers found significantly lower vitamin D levels compared to those with a good outcome. In fact, 65 percent of patients with vitamin D deficiency had a poor neurological outcome at six months after discharge compared to 23 percent of patients with healthy vitamin D levels. They also found that 29 percent of patients with vitamin D deficiency had died at six months compared to none of the patients with good vitamin D levels. \"Vitamin D deficiency increased the risk of poor neurological outcome after sudden cardiac arrest by seven-fold,\u201d Wi said, adding, \u201cA large randomized clinical trial is needed to find out whether supplements of vitamin D can protect high risk groups from having a sudden cardiac arrest.\"\n\nSource: Wi J, Shin YH, Kim JS, et al.
