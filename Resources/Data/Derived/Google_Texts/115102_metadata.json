And frankly, I am very alarmed by the implications of that aggregation of power.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat also alarms me, however, is that the two other branches appear not just simply passive, but inert in the face of this concentration of authority,\u201d he added.\n\nInterestingly enough, Turley said he actually agrees with many of the president\u2019s policies and positions \u2014 just not the way the White House has gone about implementing them.\n\n\u201cThe fact that I happen to think the president is right on many of these policies does not alter the fact that I believe the means he is doing [it] is wrong, and that this can be a dangerous change in our system,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd our system is changing in a very fundamental way. And it\u2019s changing without a whimper of regret or opposition.\u201d\n\nTurley stressed that Congress must take action if it wants to hold onto its power as the \u201cthumping heart of our system.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are now at the constitutional tipping point for our system. If balance is to be reestablished, it must begin before this president leaves office and that will likely require every possible means to reassert legislative authority,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cNo one in our system can \u2018go it alone\u2019 \u2013 not Congress , not the courts , and not the president. We are stuck with each other in a system of shared powers \u2014 for better or worse. We may deadlock or even despise each other. The framers clearly foresaw such periods. They lived in such a period. Whatever problems we are facing today in politics, they are problems of our own making. They should not be used to take from future generations a system that has safeguarded our freedoms for over 250 years,\u201d he added.\n\nAlso present at Wednesday\u2019s hearing, titled \u201cEnforcing the President\u2019s Constitutional Duty to Faithfully Execute the Laws,\u201d was Elizabeth Price Foley, a law professor at Florida International University College of Law. She agreed with Turley, adding that Congress in in danger of becoming \u201csuperfluous.\u201d\n\n\u201cSituations like this, these benevolent suspensions as they get more and more frequent and more and more aggressive, they\u2019re eroding our citizens\u2019 respect for the rule of law,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are a country of law and not men. It\u2019s going to render Congress superfluous.\u201d\n\nShe said Congress hasn\u2019t bothered with any meaningful legislation recently because it\u2019s afraid the president would \u201csimply benevolently suspend portions of the law he doesn\u2019t like.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you want to stay relevant as an institution, I would suggest that you not stand idly by and let the president take your power away,\u201d she said.\n\nThe hearing spent a good deal of time discussing possible courses of action that could be taken to keep Obama\u2019s so-called \u201cimperial presidency,\u201d as Rep. Jim Gerlach (R-Pa.) called it, in check. The idea of filing articles of impeachment against the president was briefly discussed, but quickly replaced in favor of talk of lawsuits that could be brought against the White House.\n\nImpeachment would \u201csurely be extremely divisive within the Congress and the nation generally, and would divert the attention of Congress from other important issues of the day,\u201d said Gerlach, who along with four other members of the House offered testimony on legislation that has been drafted to keep the president in check.\n\nGerlach is responsible for H.R. 857, the \u201cEnforce the Take Care Clause Act,\u201d which would make it easier and faster for federal courts to challenge executive actions.\n\n\u201cGiven the growing number of examples where this President has clearly failed to faithfully execute all laws, I believe it is time for Congress to put in place a procedure for a fast-track, independent review of those executive actions,\u201d he said.\n\nGerlach said he proposed the bill in response to the numerous Obamacare delays enacted by the White House.\n\n\u201c(T)he president, through his actions on the [Affordable Care Act], as well as in other areas of executive action, is fundamentally altering the delicate constitutional balance among the three branches of our federal system, and the concept of an \u2018imperial presidency\u2019 has reentered our national dialogue,\u201d he said.\n\nWatch the complete hearing here:\n\n(H/T: Washington Free Beacon)\n\n\u2013\n\nFollow Becket Adams (@BecketAdams) on Twitter\n\nThis post has been updated.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30; polling-uri=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/1.xml; polling-uri2=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/2.xml; polling-uri3=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/3.xml; polling-uri4=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/4.xml", "application-name": "TheBlaze.com", "twitter": {"description": "A constitutional law expert warned Congress during a hearing Wednesday that America has reached a \u201cconstitutional tipping point\u201d under the watch of President Barack Obama.
