One notable exception was the bipartisan fervor for crime policy \u201creform\u201d that could be condensed into a campaign-ad bromide: lock \u2018em up and throw away the key.\n\n\u201cThe two parties started trying to out-tough each other,\u201d says William R. Kelly, a University of Texas-Austin criminologist. \u201cOnce it became bipartisan, there was no slowing it down. There\u2019s no foil. There\u2019s no one to argue with.\u201d\n\nA popular American lament rues the lack of political cooperation in Washington and in statehouses. But be careful what you wish for. Bipartisanship in the 1980s and \u201890s sowed the seeds for today\u2019s mass incarceration crisis as pols cultivated crime platitudes over thoughtful analysis. And undoing this now-codified, multibillion-dollar political botch-job won\u2019t be easy, despite the kumbaya incantations coming from both the Right and Left.\n\n\u201cThis is an important thing to keep in mind when you\u2019re talking about where we are today with mass incarceration,\u201d Paul Wright, editor of Prison Legal News, told me. \u201cFor the past 40 years, virtually every politician\u2014Democrat and Republican, federal and state\u2014has voted in favor of virtually every imaginable tough new crime law that made sentences longer and imprisoned more people in worse conditions. There was no dissent and often no discussion. I think there was more dissent in the Soviet Union\u2019s Supreme Soviet under Brezhnev when laws were debated.\u201d\n\nNixon Paved the Way\n\nThe political roots of contemporary mass incarceration reach back to the 1960s, when escalating crime, race riots, campus protests and shocking assassinations fed a sense of growing lawlessness. Richard Nixon seized upon the attendant fear, wielding the crime issue in his presidential campaign of 1968 as a white-vs.-black counterpoint to poverty, the keystone issue of his Democratic opponent, Hubert Humphrey.\n\n\u201cNixon really was the first major national figure who embraced the loss of law and order as the problem and mass incarceration as the solution,\u201d says Kelly, author of the newly published Criminal Justice at the Crossroads: Transforming Crime and Punishment(Columbia University Press).\n\nIn a sense, bipartisan reform began as a political mashup. Both parties supported revamped sentencing in the 1970s. Conservatives wanted longer, tougher prison terms. Liberals, vexed by wildly variable punishments for the same crimes across the 95 federal districts, wanted more standardized sentences.\n\nRonald Reagan capitalized after his 1980 election, forging a bipartisan coalition fronted on the Left by Sen. Ted Kennedy, the Massachusetts Democrat. The result was creation of the U.S. Sentencing Commission, tasked with creating a \u201crational sentencing system.\u201d After more than two years of work, the commission presented Congress with 800 pages of new sentencing guidelines in 1987.\n\nFor decades, U.S. courts had used a system of indeterminate sentencing, which allowed a broad range of punishment for a particular crime\u2014five to 10 years, for example. The new guidelines assigned a much narrower, determinate sentence\u201470 months to 85 months, say. A judge\u2019s latitude was clipped.\n\nWhen the guidelines took effect on Nov. 1, 1987, Congress included a proviso that any mandatory minimum sentence introduced by congressional amendment would override the punishment decreed in the guidelines. Congress immediately began using that power, and state legislatures copied the intensely politicized federal system. Elected officials co-opted the roles of judges and other criminal justice professionals, decreeing thousands of mandatory minimums. Many were based upon emotional, ripped-from-the-headlines anecdotes. Many abhorrent crimes became political theater in statehouses, with podium-pounding legislators passing laws with an implied promise that a tougher sentence could somehow ensure that such an atrocity would never happen again.\n\nIt was nonsense, of course.\n\nClinton Takes Ownership of Crime\n\n\u201cA lot of it has been really sick or perverse,\u201d says Wright. \u201cOne guy says, hey, let\u2019s do a mandatory minimum on this crime, whatever it might be. Let\u2019s make it 20 years! And another legislator says, well, let\u2019s make it 40 years! They were just making up random numbers, pulling them out of thin air.\u201d\n\nKelly says Bill Clinton\u2019s campaign for president in 1992 was the \u201cswitch moment\u201d of crime policy bipartisanship.\n\n\u201cMuch of the political leverage on crime control had been owned by the Republican Party since the 1960s,\u201d he says. \u201cClinton helped the Democratic party realize that it had to try to take ownership away from the Republicans.\u201d\n\nAnd he did just that, says Marc Mauer, executive director of the Sentencing Project. \u201cWhile on the campaign trail in 1992 and just after returning to Arkansas (where he was governor) to oversee the execution of Ricky Ray Rector, a mentally impaired black man, Clinton had famously remarked, \u2018I can be nicked on a lot, but no one can say I\u2019m soft on crime.\u2019\u201d\n\nClinton was cheerleader-in-chief for the now-infamous federal crime bill of 1994, which authorized $33 billion to build prisons and hire more law enforcers. (It also eliminated education funding for inmates, the most reliable remedy against recidivism.) In that same era, two dozen states followed the lead of California and Washington by adopting three-strikes laws that imposed long mandatory sentences on repeat offenders, flooding prison systems with lifers.\n\n\u201cThe policies were established in states with both Democratic and Republican leadership,\u201d says Mauer, \u201cand often with little analysis of their impact or wisdom in comparison with existing sentencing policy at the time.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s All About the Votes\n\nClinton was not the only politician who used crime rhetoric as political ear-candy. In my book Scooped, published in 1998, I quoted Sen. Orrin Hatch, the Utah Republican, who said, \u201cMandatory minimums are a political response to violent crime. Let\u2019s be honest about it. It\u2019s awfully difficult for politicians to vote against them.\u201d And Sen. George Mitchell, the Maine Democrat, said tough-on-crime laws had \u201clittle to do with reducing crime and everything to do with increasing votes.\u201d\n\nReagan and Clinton often get blamed for mass incarceration. But others deserve a share.\n\n\u201cThe \u2018tough on crime\u2019 movement and the development of the \u2018war on drugs\u2019 in the 1980s and 1990s was very much a bipartisan initiative,\u201d Mauer says. \u201cThe war on drugs was formally launched by Ronald Reagan in 1982 by an administration seeking to expand the federal role in crime policy. Under the administration of George Bush Sr. the tough on crime rhetoric reached its peak under the leadership of Attorney General William Barr, who frequently framed the problem as \u2018more prisons or more crime.\u2019 And Bill Clinton, with strong support from then Sen. Joe Biden, pushed the 1994 crime bill, even highlighting its \u2018three-strikes\u2019 provision in his State of the Union address that year.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Nixon was the first to embrace mass incarceration, but it was Clinton who forged our prison industrial complex", "title": "Birth of a prison state: The bipartisan disaster that put America behind bars", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Nixon was the first to embrace mass incarceration, but it was Clinton who forged our prison industrial complex", "title": "Birth of a prison state: The bipartisan disaster that put America behind bars", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/06/04/birth_of_a_prison_state_the_bipartisan_disaster_that_put_america_behind_bars_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/04/richard_nixon2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Nixon was the first to embrace mass incarceration, but it was Clinton who forged our prison industrial complex", "title": "Birth of a prison state: The bipartisan disaster that put America behind bars", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/04/richard_nixon2.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "David J.
