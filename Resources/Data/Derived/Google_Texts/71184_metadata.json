That night's episode will also feature Sean Penn.\n\nObama made his first appearance on Kimmel via satellite in June 2008 during his initial campaign for President. Despite the big gap between appearances, the talk-show host was invited to host the White House Correspondents' dinner in 2012. A few months after, ahead of the election, First Lady Michelle Obama stopped by Kimmel for an interview and a goofy pre-taped bit where she shoved the host out of bed so he would vote (and eat his carrots).\n\nPresident Obama has actively made the late-night rounds throughout his tenure in office. He has primarily visited The Tonight Show and Late Show but he has also swung by Late Night while Jimmy Fallon was still host for some sultry slow jamming of the news.\n\nMore recently, Obama helped Stephen Colbert bid farewell to the Colbert Report by showing him up at his own job. Obama butted in during Colbert's regular \"The Word\" segment, which he decisively renamed \"The Decree,\" and proceeded to poke fun at his own Affordable Care Act. \"Remember the original healthcare.gov website? I think that's where Disney got the idea for Frozen,\" he cracked.\n\nOutside of the late-night circuit, Obama has also taken to working with online media outlets as a way to promote his signature health care bill. Recently, he snapped a few selfies for Buzzfeed, and in 2014 he sat down with Zach Galifianakis for a hilarious and typically awkward edition of \"Between Two Ferns.\"", "article_metadata": {"description": "President Barack Obama will make his second appearance ever on 'Jimmy Kimmel Live!' later this week.", "og": {"site_name": "Rolling Stone", "description": "President will return to the show for the first time since 2008 later this week", "title": "Obama to Appear on 'Jimmy Kimmel Live'", "url": "http://www.rollingstone.com/tv/news/obama-to-appear-on-jimmy-kimmel-live-20150310", "image": {"width": 1401, "identifier": "http://assets.rollingstone.com/assets/2015/article/obama-to-appear-on-jimmy-kimmel-live-20150310/188401/large_rect/1425991303/1401x788-4186344353_ffd66afd5a_o.jpg", "height": 788}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://assets.rollingstone.com/assets/2015/article/obama-to-appear-on-jimmy-kimmel-live-20150310/188401/large_rect/1425991303/1401x788-4186344353_ffd66afd5a_o.jpg"}, "title": "Obama to Appear on 'Jimmy Kimmel Live'", "description": "President will return to the show for the first time since 2008 later this week", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@RollingStone"}, "fb": {"app_id": 107978575944240}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/rollingstone", "published_time": "2015-03-10T14:04:00Z"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, maximum-scale=1.0, target-densityDpi=device-dpi", "news_keywords": "barack obama, jimmy kimmel live, jimmy kimmel, obama jimmy kimmel live, barack obama jimmy kimmel,obama kimmel,obama tv,obama speech,obama on tv,obama"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdda93\"", "article_summary": "Kristoffer Tripplaar/ SipaPresident Barack Obama will return to Jimmy Kimmel Live!\nMore recently, Obama helped Stephen Colbert bid farewell to the Colbert Report by showing him up at his own job.\nthis week, sitting down with the ABC late night show this Thursday, March 12th, according to The Hollywood Reporter.\nObama made his first appearance on Kimmel via satellite in June 2008 during his initial campaign for President.\nOutside of the late-night circuit, Obama has also taken to working with online media outlets as a way to promote his signature health care bill."}
