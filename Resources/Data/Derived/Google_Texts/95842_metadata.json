He left once in 1984 following a conviction for attacking a man he suspected of having an affair with his estranged wife. Ray DeLeo, the man who received a barrage of smacks, punches, spittle, death threats, airborne ashtrays and attempts to snuff a lit cigarette in his eye, once said of that incident, \u201cI saw a crazed man\u2026 I saw a lunatic.\u201d Cianci pleaded no contest to assault charges, received a five-year suspended sentence, and stepped down from City Hall, as members of his staff wept.\n\nCianci resigned again in 2002 (he was re-elected in 1990 and won every election in the interim), after he was convicted in U.S. District Court of a single count of federal racketeering (RICO) conspiracy, a crime the judge described as running City Hall as \u201ca criminal enterprise.\u201d The enduring image from the trial came from grainy, secret-camera tape showing Cianci\u2019s director of administration accepting an envelope filled with cash and placing it in a drawer in his desk. In a now-famous courtroom speech at the sentencing, Judge Ernest Torres compared Cianci to Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. \u201cThere appear to be two very different Buddy Ciancis,\u201d he said. \u201dThe first is a skilled and charismatic political figure, probably one of the most talented politicians Rhode Island has ever seen.\u201d The other, he said, \u201c\u2019presided over an administration that is rife with corruption at all levels.\u201d Cianci spent the next four and a half years at Federal Correctional Institution Fort Dix, in New Jersey.\n\nFast-forward to June 2014, when a leaner, grayer, balder, post-prison, post-cancer Cianci was earning six figures as the afternoon drive-time host of \u201cThe Buddy Cianci Show,\u201d on News Talk 630 WPRO AM, in East Providence. The show\u2019s theme music was a big-band arrangement of the old show tune \u201cRhode Island Is Famous for You.\u201d For months Cianci had stoked speculation about whether or not he\u2019d run for his old job, with incumbent Democrat Angel Taveras officially running for governor. The buzz reached a crescendo on-air on the day of the candidacy filing deadline, when, as the minutes ticked down and Cianci took adoring call after adoring call urging him to run, he finally said, \u201cToday with a sense of humility, contrition, and confidence, I announce to you my candidacy for mayor of Providence.\u201d\n\nPresident Obama\u2019s endorsement of Cianci\u2019s opponent this week has hardly been the most notable moment since then. That may have come when three former U.S. Attorneys, including former Rhode Island Governor Lincoln Almond and current U.S. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, held a press conference to tell everyone how bad of an idea it would be to elect Cianci. Or when Cianci\u2019s Republican opponent, Dr. Dan Harrop, who is polling at 2.8 percent, made a $1,000 donation to his Democratic opponent, Elorza. Or when a longtime Cianci opponent was arrested for allegedly assaulting a female Cianci supporter at a recent mayoral forum. Or when former Providence mayor and Cianci foe-turned-BFF Joe Paolino told Boston Magazine, \u201cHe\u2019s got cancer in the rectum! So nobody\u2019s been more vetted than that.\u201d Or when the Providence Journal ran a seemingly never-ending series of anti-Cianci editorials (\u201cLying for Votes,\u201d \u201cEndorsing Corruption,\u201d \u201cPay-to-Play Police,\u201d \u201cCianci\u2019s Half-Truths\u201d), including one that simply presented excerpts from Cianci\u2019s 2011 memoir, \u201cPolitics and Pasta.\u201d (Example: \u201cI admit that I used jobs as currency to get the support I needed, I admit that I used campaign money for everything from a personal helicopter to get around the state to paying for dinners, and on occasion I even used my influence to do favors for people.\u201d)\n\nSo, how does a guy manage to poll in the high 30s in a three-way race for the job he previously used to commit a felony or two?\n\nFirst, Cianci is a man of prodigious political gifts. He\u2019s tenacious. (Just ask Ray DeLeo.) He\u2019s hilarious. (A line from his book: \u201cI used to tell people that if I had gone outside and walked on water across the Providence River, the next morning the headline of the Journal would have been CIANCI CAN\u2019T SWIM!\u201d) He\u2019s a tireless campaigner. (Personal anecdote: I have a photo with Cianci from a Little League opening day in the mid-1990s, when I was 9 years old; he\u2019s famous for attending such events. Years later, when I taught a writing class about Providence at the Rhode Island School of Design, he accepted my classroom invitation and regaled 15 students for an hour and a half.) And his would-you-want-to-have-a-beer-with-him? rating is off the charts. In fact, Providence is so small and Cianci is so ubiquitous that people actually have had that proverbial drink with him. And they\u2019ll never forget it. Providence might the home of the late, legendary sci-fi/horror author H.P. Lovecraft, but Buddy Stories are our most popular literary genre. \u201cMy Buddy story?\u201d reads one I recently saw on Facebook. \u201cI stood\u2019s [sic] shoulder to shoulder with Cianci and his mistress as we watched a drag queen beat a muscleman with a dildo as part of an S&M show in a coke bar.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "From mistresses to dildos to prison to City Hall, Buddy Cianci's career is too odd to believe -- and it's not over", "title": "\u201cA crazed man\u2026 a lunatic!\u201d Why ex-con, pasta sauce salesman, former mayor Buddy Cianci is back for more", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "From mistresses to dildos to prison to City Hall, Buddy Cianci's career is too odd to believe -- and it's not over", "title": "\u201cA crazed man\u2026 a lunatic!\u201d Why ex-con, pasta sauce salesman, former mayor Buddy Cianci is back for more", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/11/01/a_crazed_man_a_lunatic_why_ex_con_pasta_sauce_salesman_former_mayor_buddy_cianci_is_back_for_more/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/10/buddy_cianci.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "From mistresses to dildos to prison to City Hall, Buddy Cianci's career is too odd to believe -- and it's not over", "title": "\u201cA crazed man\u2026 a lunatic!\u201d Why ex-con, pasta sauce salesman, former mayor Buddy Cianci is back for more", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/10/buddy_cianci.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Philip Eil", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, 2014 elections, Cities, convict, Corruption, criminal, Editor's Picks, mayor, pasta sauce, Providence, rhode island, RICO", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Topics: 2014 elections, Cities, convict, Corruption, criminal, Editor's Picks, mayor, pasta sauce, Providence, rhode island, RICO, Politics NewsWhy did President Barack Obama endorse a candidate in the Providence, Rhode Island (pop.\nOr when a longtime Cianci opponent was arrested for allegedly assaulting a female Cianci supporter at a recent mayoral forum.\nOr when former Providence mayor and Cianci foe-turned-BFF Joe Paolino told Boston Magazine, \u201cHe\u2019s got cancer in the rectum!\n\u201cThere appear to be two very different Buddy Ciancis,\u201d he said.\nAttorneys, including former Rhode Island Governor Lincoln Almond and current U.S."}
