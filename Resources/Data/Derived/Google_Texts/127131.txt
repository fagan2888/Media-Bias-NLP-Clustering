Tuesday morning, Democratic lawmakers pulled the tarp off of an immigration package containing 10 bills that the state legislators hope will build momentum for federal immigration action.

One of the bills, proposed by Senator Ricardo Lara (D-Bell Gardens) would allow enrollment in Medi-Cal for immigrants so long as they qualify, regardless of their immigration status. Senator Richard Pan (D-Sacramento) has also proposed a bill that would prohibit businesses from refusing to provide service on the basis of citizenship or immigration status.

Will this bill package help spur federal immigration action? Would you change anything about the bills proposed?
