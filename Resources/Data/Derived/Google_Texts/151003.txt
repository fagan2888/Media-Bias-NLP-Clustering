DENVER (MainStreet) — In the ten months that recreational weed has been legal in Colorado, manufacturers of marijuana-infused edible foods have reinvented their product lines and labels to comply with the ever-changing rules and regulations governing the industry.

Because of the way marijuana is metabolized, ingesting marijuana generally produces a stronger and longer-lasting effect -- as a number of people have discovered after ingesting too much of a THC-infused product. After a series of negative events, including a college student who jumped to his death after eating a pot cookie and New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd who reported she “lay curled up in a hallucinatory ball” after ingesting weed-infused candy, marijuana regulators issued “emergency” rules for the sale and manufacture of cannabis-infused food products.

Edible manufacturers now have until February 1 to make products that have no more than 10 mg of THC apiece -- the state-determined amount for one dose -- or a clean way to break products with larger amounts into 10 mg doses.

With many edibles containing well over the state-recommended dosage, just about everyone has to develop new products or invest in new equipment and labeling.
