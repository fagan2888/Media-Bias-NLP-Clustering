The organization represents the interests of Pennsylvania\u2019s 164 general acute care hospitals and other health facilities.\n\nIndianapolis-based Anthem said its top priority is \u201cthe best health coverage possible,\u201d vowing in a statement that affordable policies and quality care are \u201cthe foundation of the proposed transaction.\u201d\n\nCigna of Bloomfield, Conn., and the Department of Justice, which is reviewing the plan, did not comment.\n\nAt America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans, a Washington, D.C.-based trade group, executive vice president Beth Leonard blamed \u201cyears of anticompetitive hospital consolidation\u201d for steeper health care costs.\n\nAnthem announced July 24 that it would buy rival Cigna for about $54.2 billion, a combination that would cover about 17 percent of the U.S. population \u2014 more than 53 million people. The companies announced the agreement three weeks after Aetna Inc. pledged to buy Humana Inc. for $37 billion.\n\nIf the deals pass muster with federal and state antitrust officials, they would collapse the five largest health insurers in the country into three.\n\nShifting insurance markets under the federal Affordable Care Act and consolidation among hospitals are helping propel the merger plans, which should help insurers pare costs and negotiate reimbursement rates more aggressively with care providers, industry analysts said.\n\nThe would-be merged companies expect the transactions to close in the second half of 2016.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s great uncertainty, but it would be a surprise to me if [the mergers] didn\u2019t go through in some form,\u201d said Scott Harrington, a health care management professor at the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nHe said regulators could force the combined insurers to trim some services in areas where they might command too much of the market and edge too close to monopoly status.\n\nHartford, Conn.-based Aetna and Humana of Louisville, Ky., account for about 12 percent and 1.1. percent of the Pennsylvania health insurance market, respectively, according to state records. Cigna claims about 3 percent.\n\nThe state Insurance Department has said Anthem has no presence in the market, although the company insures some Pennsylvanians employed by firms based in other states. Downtown-based Highmark Health and UPMC Health Plan are the largest health insurers in Western Pennsylvania.\n\n\u201cYou want choice for patients and employers,\u201d said Dennis Olmstead, chief strategy officer at the Pennsylvania Medical Society in Harrisburg. \u201cWhoever is paying the bill, you would hope they would have a choice in the market \u2014 not just one or two payers.\u201d\n\nReuters contributed.
