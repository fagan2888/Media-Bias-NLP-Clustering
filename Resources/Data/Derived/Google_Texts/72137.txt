Calling all analysts, code developers, software testers, and project managers: Society desperately needs your collaborative skills to help our communities. Most community and civic groups don't understand how government works, lack funding, and must create programming with limited resources. They also have difficulties holding onto talent and meeting the needs of the communities they serve. They could use an infusion of people used to operating on tight deadlines and dealing with limited budgets and dwindling human resources.

This idea goes back to 2001 when, in the wake of 9/11, I was working on a project to map community organizing and activism in the United States. I remember walking into the ground-floor apartment of a coder named David Jacobs. It was my first time interacting with a coder. His place was piled high with records and CDs and he worked like—and was in fact—an artist.

Over the years I came to consider developers and artists one and the same; they could be a bit moody at times but created brilliant work. You had to coddle them but also treat them with deep respect because your idea rested on the relationship in that moment.

Coders work differently now because everything requires their attention. There is a digital strategy, a mobile strategy, internal operations, HR, and everything in between. A strong technology team is arguably as central to an organization as its brand and identity. It used to be that the "webmaster" worked in Diet-Cokeand-pizza-fueled binges of creative bursts and output. Or if they were like Jacobs, they ate salads, drank water, and dabbled in yoga. Either way, you gave them requirements and wireframes or just a problem to solve, and they would work their magic.

Now, that coders are vital to every enterprise, they have become incredibly diverse and, in some cases, high-functioning in the work sector. The fact that their work touches almost every aspect of an organization is critical; they do not think of parts anymore, but in terms of a whole company.

We talk a lot about what the Internet can do and about the brainiacs who created it but we rarely talk about the changes that have taken place in the way we work in the process. Yes, we have teams whose members are dispersed all over the world, but how do these teams collaborate despite language and cultural barriers and the lack of face-to-face cues?

The change is profound. You can call it a transformation from a waterfall model, which is rooted in industrialization and churning out products in a traditional factory, to a nimble and distributed approach where multifunctional teams play multiple roles and adapt to changes in real time.

So what can we do? If you are an analyst, code developer, software tester, or project manager who has been using agile and scrum methodology, you actually have muscle memory the world needs to help manage more than just products, software, or the latest app.

I love Winston Churchill's cynical quote that says, "democracy is the worst form of government, except for all the others." It highlights the messiness of what happens when people get together to accomplish something. Interestingly, in countries like America, India, and the United Kingdom, there are many of these messy, unorganized, and critically needed organizations working hard to make our democracies effective. These "frontlines" of our democracy I define as our co-op and condo boards, neighborhood associations, religious groups, youth groups, sports leagues, and even hunger and anti-poverty programs. All of these organizations could use seasoned technologists as part of their team to share what they know of working in diverse teams and pushing through challenges to get something done.

The bottom line is that all of our organizations need an infusion of this "new way to work" and the skilled professionals immersed in it need to help share it beyond the tech world.
