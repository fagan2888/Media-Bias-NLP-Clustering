Surrounded by rolling fields of marble gravestones each decorated with an American flag and flowers, a large crowd gathered under the sun on Monday morning at Fort Logan National Cemetery to remember fallen soldiers.

Families, veterans and active servicemen and women joined in an 11 a.m. ceremony at the cemetery before walking the grounds to visit graves.

About halfway through the ceremony, Earl Depner, 94, wandered off into the rows of marble gravestones by himself.

He took his time, walking slowly with his wooden cane, looking at all the names engraved on the stones.

Depner visits Fort Logan every year on Memorial Day — and, on other days, as often as he can — to leave flowers on the grave of his wife, Rosanna.

Rosanna died 17 years ago after raising two boys with her husband and serving two tours with the United States armed forces during World War II and the Korean war.

She served as a Civil Service secretary for the Army Corps of Engineers and then transferred into a position with the Air Force — which is where she met Depner.

Depner also served in World War II and in Korea as a pilot in what used to be called the Army Aircorps.

“I started flying before the war,” he said. “I spent what money I could to learn to fly.”

The North American Aviation P-51 Mustangs played a big part in the ending of World War II, Depner said, and he was proud to have been part of the first U.S. fighter group to use the a P-51 for combat.

“I loved that plane,” Depner said.

As memories of the aircraft were replaying for the veteran, a P-51 airplane flew overhead. “Well, I’ll be darned,” Depner said, pointing to the sky. “I recognize it by the sound.”

Depner’s memories of war are still strong — like the time when he was shot down while flying or when he volunteered for a mission in Korea.

“I think I benefited from the experience, but I wouldn’t want to go back to war,” he said. “I no longer believe in war to solve things. There is too much suffering involved.”
