The report credits the growth of the digital X-ray systems market to the rising prevalence of dental, respiratory and cardiovascular diseases across the globe. The rising geriatric population is also responsible for the growing demand for digital X-ray systems. Digital X-ray systems offer high spatial resolution, and are therefore preferred by the majority of doctors, thus impacting the digital X-ray systems market positively.

The implementation of legal provisions, such as the Affordable Care Act in the U.S., challenges the global digital X-ray systems market. Additionally, the high cost of digital X-ray systems leads to the lower adoption of such systems in clinics, hospitals, and other healthcare facilities, thus inhibiting the market.
