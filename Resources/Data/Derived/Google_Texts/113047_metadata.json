(Photo: File / The Tennessean)Buy Photo\n\nThe intellectually and developmentally disabled community of Tennessee faces a crisis in the quality of their care and in their ability and desire to contribute to society.\n\nA 46 percent turnover rate among those who directly care for them has created inconsistency and instability that jeopardize clients\u2019 health and prospects.\n\nThe system is heavily reliant on private services because they can offer care at half the cost of the state. However, with rising health care and technology costs, in addition to mandatory minimum wage increases, employers cannot compete with other business, such as fast-food restaurants, for direct support employees.\n\nWhat that means is that the fully professional, stable workforce that once cared for the state\u2019s most vulnerable \u2014 and voiceless \u2014 citizens no longer exists.\n\nAs a consequence, clients are constantly having to build relationships and trust with new caregivers, taking a toll on their emotional well-being.\n\nIn addition, because rules require staff to be present when clients are working \u2014 whether it is sorting clothes at a retail shop or moving boxes at a warehouse \u2014 the unstable workforce has resulted in leaving 80 percent of intellectually and developmentally disabled clients unemployed.\n\nThat further isolates them and makes them more vulnerable.\n\nState lawmakers and Gov. Bill Haslam can help reverse the poor retention rate.\n\nThey could amend the state budget to allow the Department of Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities to provide the Bureau of TennCare $21 million in recurring funds, thus enabling providers to pay direct-service employees a $1-an-hour raise.\n\nThat money would be matched at a rate of 2-to-1 by the federal government, bringing that investment to $60 million.\n\nSurely, with the state\u2019s healthy financial outlook and its half-billion surplus, attending to the 9,000 intellectually and developmentally disabled citizens should be a priority.\n\nHaslam's spokeswoman Jennifer Donnals said: \"We're beginning the budget amendment process now, and this is one of many requests that have been made. The governor will continue, as he has done during his time in office, to take a thoughtful and deliberate approach to the state's budget and how taxpayer dollars are spent.\"\n\nOf course, Haslam and lawmakers should be commended for approving $24 million in the 2016 budget to ensure services for intellectually and developmentally disabled people who were on the state\u2019s waiting list.\n\nHowever, that money did not go for those who were already receiving services and the people who directly work with them.\n\nThat workforce numbers 20,000 employees, and the average hourly salary is $8.61, about $340 a week or $18,000 a year.\n\nThat is below a living wage, and the state\u2019s formula keeps that wage stagnant.\n\nThe minimum wage is $7.25 an hour.\n\n\u201cThe problem is, they could be making more at McDonald\u2019s,\u201d said Luke Queen, vice president for operations for Evergreen Life Services, a private provider of care.\n\nQueen recently visited with The Tennessean Editorial Board along with Evergreen house manager Molly Sullivan; Robin Atwood, executive director of Tennessee Community Organizations; and three of the clients who live in Sullivan\u2019s home \u2014 Patricia Medlin, 71, and twins Charity and Chelsea James, both 31.\n\nMedlin\u2019s sister Eleanor Thompson also attended.\n\nMedlin still works, but the James sisters are unemployed and want to go back to work in retail.\n\nThese women want to offer their skills and talent and should not be denied that opportunity because of instability in the workforce that is supposed to care for them, protect them and encourage them to live up to their potential.\n\nThe state can make a difference for Patricia, Charity, Chelsea and thousands more. It has the means to do so and should act.\n\nSend the governor and lawmakers this message if you agree.\n\nOpinion Engagement Editor David Plazas wrote this editorial on behalf of The Tennessean Editorial Board.
