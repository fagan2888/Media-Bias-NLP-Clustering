TRENTON, N.J. (AP) — New Jersey is the latest state to consider requiring colleges to define when “yes means yes” in an effort to stem the tide of sexual assaults.

But whether the policy — known as affirmative consent — will reduce sexual assaults on campus remains unclear. States and universities across the U.S. are under pressure to change how they handle rape allegations.

One rape survivor says she thinks an affirmative consent standard would have helped in her case.

Supporters and critics agree the measure could encourage students to talk openly and clearly about sex and that a culture of “yes means yes” could help address sexual assaults on campuses.

But skeptics of the policy raise questions about whether it offers enough protections for the accused and victims alike.
