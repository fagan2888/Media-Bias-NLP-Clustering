COOLBAUGH TOWNSHIP -- A fire company in Monroe County honored some pint-sized volunteers Sunday for their help this past winter.

The Coolbaugh Township Volunteer Fire Company near Tobyhanna asked young volunteers and their parents to help shovel show off fire hydrants.

The kids shoveled the hydrants, took a photo, and sent it to the department.

The fire company held a pizza party Sunday to reward those volunteers for their help.

The fire chief says the help was greatly appreciated.

"They are loving it. We love it. We like having them here. It really saved us a lot of work going out and shoveling the hydrants. It worked out well for everyone," said Coolbaugh Township Volunteer Fire Chief Kevin Ambrogio.

Firefighters showed the young volunteers around the fire station. The kids also tried on equipment and even got to go for a ride on the fire truck.
