This isn’t George Costanza helplessly jumping in those weird shoes; this is a full-throttle leap, leprechaun-y, with such intensity that as Broncos punter Britton Colquitt said, “My wife’s always worried that he’s going to pull a hamstring or turn an ankle.”

Have you seen this? Matt Prater, the Broncos’ Pro Bowl kicker, does this trampoline-like leap before every kickoff.

“I started doing it because it helps me loosen up my legs, get the juices flowing a little bit,” Prater said. “I go back to 10 yards, and then I do the jump before I move 5 over. It helps me loosen up. I just jump, bring my knees up — and try not to fall down.”

I’m not sure if it’ll take off like “Tebowing,” but as seen in this video below, I have created “Pratering” (though, to be fair, I sort of just look like Costanza).



As for Prater, he’s a weapon. I think some people just take for granted how efficient he is. He’s as close to automatic as the NFL has — he was 25-for-26 this season on field-goal attempts, while scoring a franchise record 150 points.

He’s a stud. He owns the best field-goal percentage from 50-plus yards since the NFL merger; he’s 21-for-27. And, of course, he set the NFL record with a 64-yard kick this season. Here’s my column from that day about Prater and his lucky boots.

And that’s all from me — I need to go ice my hamstring after my ill-fated Pratering.
