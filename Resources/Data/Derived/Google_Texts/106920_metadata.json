And I thought that we could win some games here. I still do. I still think we can win some more left. They're going to be tough. They're really good football teams.\n\n\"Senior day is awesome for the seniors but now the seniors actually have a little bit more to play for and so do the players out there. So when they come back Sunday, I guarantee you they're going to be a little bit more tuned up and a little bit sharper. I wish they were always that way.\"\n\nIf they could all be home games on windy days in November, the Colorado football program might be rolling.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn front 38,252, the Buffs snapped their 14-game losing streak in the Pac-12 Conference on a cold, blustery evening that turned out to be a lot of fun for a change on the home sideline in Boulder. They also earned their 300th victory at Folsom Field.\n\nIt is just the fourth CU win over a Pac-12 foe since the school joined the conference prior to the 2011 season and it came two years and four days after the Buffs earned their first victory in the conference over Arizona. That 2011 win came on a day with very similar conditions.\n\nColorado's De'Jon Wilson, left, and Paul Richardson celebrate the Buffs' win by singing the school fight song with fans after Saturday's game at Folsom Field. ( CLIFF GRASSMICK )\n\nThe Buffs kept their bowl hopes alive for another week by improving to 4-6 overall and 1-6 in the conference.\n\n\"November matters,\" said senior safety Parker Orms, who sat out Saturday with a shoulder injury. \"So that's a big thing right now. So we'll be looking forward to next week.\"\n\nCal now holds the longest losing streak in the Pac-12. The Bears have lost 13 straight conference games and lost for the ninth consecutive time this season.\n\nRichardson had another memorable game against the Bears, although it wasn't the highlight-reel performance he provided here in a non-conference loss to Cal two years ago.\n\nRichardson set a new single-season school record for receiving yards while tying his school record for receptions in a game and moved into fourth place on the career receptions list.\n\nHe caught 11 passes for 140 yards giving him 1,201 receiving yards this season surpassing the old single-season record of 1,149 yards set by Charles E. Johnson in 1992.\n\nRichardson has steadfastly said since the summer months before the season started that he believes this team can reach a bowl game this season. It's still facing two rather large hurdles, but he believes now more than ever.\n\n\"It feels great to be able to have that opportunity,\" Richardson said. \"Why not finish off the season with a home streak with this upcoming game and have that momentum carry us on for the rest of the season?\"\n\nBut on Richardson's record-setting night, he was almost overshadowed by fellow wide receiver Nelson Spruce who made seven catches for a career-best 140 yards and also returned an onside-kick attempt for a touchdown.\n\nIt was the first time CU produced two 100-yard receivers in the same game since the 2009 season finale at Nebraska and it coincided with the first 300-yard passing performance in the career of true freshman quarterback Sefo Liufau.\n\nHe completed 23 of 36 passes for 364 yards and three scores.\n\n\"He's just growing up out there,\" Richardson said. \"Each and every week he's getting better.\"\n\nCal played without leading tackler and Butkus Award candidate Khairi Fortt, a big blow to the worst defense in the conference.\n\nBoth offenses started slowly trying to adapt to the wind.\n\nThe Buffs led 3-0 early in the second quarter when Liufau connected with tight end Kyle Slavin on a 10-yard touchdown pass to push the advantage to double digits.\n\nCal evened things up 10-10 later in the quarter on a 42-yard field goal from Vincenzo D'Amato that was kicked through uprights swaying in the wind on the north end of the stadium and a 55-yard touchdown run down the west sideline by running back Khalfani Muhammad.\n\nCU took the lead for good with 2 minutes, 40 seconds remaining in the first half when Liufau hit Tony Jones with a 10-yard touchdown pass.\n\nOn the ensuing kickoff, Will Oliver drilled the ball low toward a Cal player in the middle of the field 10 yards away. It was likely an attempt to keep the ball down out of the wind but wound up hitting Darius Powe and was recovered by CU reserve Isaac Archuleta.\n\nRunning back Christian Powell breezed into the end zone on a 2-yard touchdown run nine plays later.\n\nThe CU defense ranked 111th in the nation against the pass coming into the game but held up well against the eighth-best passing attack in the nation. The Buffs came up with three sacks and held freshman quarterback Jared Goff to 173 passing yards and no touchdowns.\n\nThe Cal offense padded its numbers in the fourth quarter with two drives ending in touchdown runs by Brendan Bigelow.\n\nCU fans have grown too used to watching Pac-12 opponents score meaningless touchdowns late in a mostly empty Folsom Field. But they came Saturday as CU was celebrating the win.\n\nContact staff writer Kyle Ringo at ringok@dailycamera.com or twitter.com/kyleringo.\n\nColorado 41, California 24\n\nCalifornia 0 10 0 14--24\n\nColorado 3 21 3 14--41\n\nFirst Quarter\n\nCol -- FG Oliver 27, 3:02.\n\nSecond Quarter\n\nCol -- Slavin 10 pass from Liufau (Oliver kick), 14:56.\n\nCal -- FG D'Amato 42, 8:25.\n\nCal -- Muhammad 55 run (D'Amato kick), 7:11.\n\nCol -- T.Jones 10 pass from Liufau (Oliver kick), 2:40.\n\nCol -- Powell 2 run (Oliver kick), :46.\n\nThird Quarter\n\nCol -- FG Oliver 24, :42.\n\nFourth Quarter\n\nCol -- Adkins 63 pass from Liufau (Oliver kick), 12:22.\n\nCal -- Bigelow 1 run (D'Amato kick), 6:14.\n\nCol -- Spruce 46 kickoff return (Oliver kick), 6:07.\n\nCal -- Bigelow 26 run (D'Amato kick), 1:23.\n\nA -- 38,252.\n\nCal Col\n\nFirst downs 23 23\n\nRushes-yards 34-197 38-121\n\nPassing 214 364\n\nComp-Att-Int 26-52-1 23-36-1\n\nReturn Yards 12 2\n\nPunts-Avg. 7-48.3 5-37.0\n\nFumbles-Lost 2-1 0-0\n\nPenalties-Yards 4-37 4-33\n\nTime of Possession 27:19 32:36\n\nINDIVIDUAL STATISTICS\n\nRUSHING -- California, Bigelow 15-107, Muhammad 10-78, Goff 6-9, Kline 3-3.
