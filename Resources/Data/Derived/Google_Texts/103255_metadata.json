Health insurers and generic drug companies have prevailed in most states over brand-name pharmaceutical companies.\n\nTheir latest victory came in dramatic fashion on Saturday, when Gov. Jerry Brown of California vetoed a bill that had passed both houses of the legislature with overwhelming bipartisan support, but that critics said would limit the use of less expensive drugs.\n\nWith billions of dollars in sales at stake, the fighting is expected to continue. It is also moving from states to the federal government and even the World Health Organization.\n\nThe battle concerns how easily pharmacists can dispense cheaper, near-generic versions of biotechnology drugs, which can cost tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars a year. The biotech drugs, known as biologics, include blockbusters like the rheumatoid arthritis treatments Enbrel and Humira and the cancer drugs Avastin and Herceptin.\n\nUntil now, biologics, which are complex proteins made in living cells, have been insulated from the generic competition eventually faced by simple chemical pills like Lipitor or Prozac. But the 2010 Affordable Care Act called for the Food and Drug Administration to approve such copycat versions of biologics. They are usually called biosimilars rather than generics, because they are not exact copies of the original.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut whether pharmacists will be permitted to substitute a biosimilar for the brand-name biologic is governed by states. So biotechnology companies, led by Amgen and Genentech, began lobbying states legislatures this year to pass laws like the bill in California.\n\nThe California bill, SB 598, would have allowed biosimilars to be substituted by pharmacists if the F.D.A. deemed the biosimilar \u201cinterchangeable\u201d with the reference product, a higher standard than merely being similar.\n\nBut the bill would have required pharmacists to tell the patient\u2019s doctor whether a biosimilar or the brand-name drug had been dispensed. The pharmacist also would have been required to notify the patient if a substitution had been made.\n\nOpponents of the bill, which included some labor unions and pharmacists, contended that once the F.D.A. had declared a biosimilar interchangeable with the original product, notification of doctors and patients was unnecessary and would only raise doubts about the safety of biosimilars and discourage their use.\n\nSupporters of the bill, which included some medical societies and patient advocacy groups, said it was essential for doctors to know which drug was being used in case problems arose. Even slight differences might, for instance, cause a patient to have an immune reaction to a biosimilar but not to the original biologic.\n\nMr. Brown seemed torn on notification. \u201cThis requirement, which on its face looks reasonable, is for some reason highly controversial,\u201d he said in his veto message.\n\n\u201cDoctors with whom I have spoken would welcome this information,\u201d he said. \u201cCalpers and other large purchasers warn that the requirement itself would cast doubt on the safety and desirability of more cost-effective alternatives to biologics.\u201d Calpers is the California Public Employees\u2019 Retirement System, which provides health benefits to more than 1.3 million people.\n\nBut Mr. Brown added that because the F.D.A. had not decided on the standards for interchangeability, a notification requirement was premature.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nRalph G. Neas, president of the Generic Pharmaceutical Association, celebrated the veto, saying that Mr. Brown had \u201cdemonstrated compassion for millions of patients and strong fiscal stewardship for the state of California.\u201d\n\nThe Biotechnology Industry Organization by contrast said it was disappointed. \u201cAs other states continue to address issues related to biosimilars, BIO encourages policy makers to continue to put patients first,\u201d it said in a statement issued Sunday.\n\nAccording to the Generic Pharmaceutical Association, bills were proposed but did not become law this year in 10 states besides California, including Illinois and Texas.\n\nNorth Dakota enacted a law in line with the proposals of the biotechnology companies. Oregon, Utah and Virginia enacted laws but with sunset provisions that might take effect before any interchangeable drugs are approved. Florida enacted a law that does not require physician notification. Bills are pending in Massachusetts and Pennsylvania.\n\nThe bills would affect only a small percentage of biologic drugs that are dispensed through retail pharmacies, like Enbrel and Humira. Most biologic drugs, like those for cancer, are administered in doctors\u2019 offices or hospitals.\n\nThe battle now shifts to whether biosimilars should have generic names different from those of the reference products. The World Health Organization oversees those names, though the F.D.A. is expected to decide for the United States.\n\nOnce again, biotechnology companies contend that this is necessary so that any safety problems that arise can be traced back to a particular manufacturer. The generic manufacturers say that if a biosimilar has a different name from the reference product, substitution by a pharmacist would not be allowed.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20131013194623, "twitter": {"description": "The bill would have allowed biosimilar versions of biologic drugs to be substituted by pharmacists if the F.D.A. deemed them \u201cinterchangeable\u201d with the reference product.", "title": "Gov.
