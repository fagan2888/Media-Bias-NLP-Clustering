Police have arrested a 17-year-old boy in connection with a triple shooting at a Pittsburgh-area mall. Former Ohio State football player Terrelle Pryor says he saw the whole thing.

Gunfire erupted about 7:30 p.m. Saturday inside a Macy's at the Monroeville Mall, sending panicked shoppers running. The gunman managed to escape but police say they were able to identify him by matching surveillance video with images on social media.

Local sources along with The Columbus Dispatch report that former Ohio State football player Terrelle Pryor tweeted that he was there when the chaos began.

"Damn was just in monroeville mall and just saw 2 ppl get shot," he tweeted. "They are letting guns go in there." That tweet has since been deleted.

The suspect was arrested at a home in Brackenridge about 3:15 a.m. and is being held at the Allegheny County Jail while awaiting arraignment.

Monroeville Police Chief Douglas Cole says two men who were shot, including the intended target, were hospitalized in critical condition, while a woman who was less seriously injured.

In late December, hundreds of teenagers gathered at the mall and several fights broke out. The fights caused local officials and mall administration to agree on a plan to increase security there.
