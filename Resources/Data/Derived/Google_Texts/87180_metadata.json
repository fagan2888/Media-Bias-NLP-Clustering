It\u2019s long been understood that being born prematurely interrupts a child\u2019s development, affecting everything from their brain function to the size and function of their lungs, which usually finish developing in the final weeks of pregnancy. Among these poorly developed life functions are the baby\u2019s immune system, which, for quite some time, doctors believed performed just as poorly. A new study, however, suggests that we haven\u2019t been giving the premature baby\u2019s immune system enough credit.\n\nPreemies are already at a higher risk for infection, like most babies. Treating them quickly is the best way to prevent its spread to the bloodstream where it can cause sepsis, a life-threatening complication. The study, from researchers at King\u2019s College London, found that a preemie\u2019s immune system is stronger than once thought, and that it may just work differently than it would in an adult. If the researchers can find a way to tap into this newly found immune process, they may be able to help preemies fight infections better.\n\nUntil now, infants\u2019 immune systems were believed to be mildly suppresses so that they wouldn\u2019t trigger an inflammatory response to the developing baby\u2019s body parts. Doctors believed that this immune suppression altered the structure of T cells, which are integral to a properly functioning immune system, and even prevented them from fighting pathogens. However, after analyzing the blood of 28 very premature babies, they found that the T cells actually produced a strong antibacterial molecule called interleukin 8 (IL8), which signals white blood cells like neutrophils and basophils to the site of infection. Though scientists have known about IL8\u2019s function, they didn\u2019t know T cells could produce if in high quantities.\n\n\u201cWe found that babies have an in-built antibacterial defense mechanism that works differently to adults, but nevertheless may be effective in protecting them,\u201d said lead author Dr. Deena Gibbons, of the Department of Immunobiology, in a press release. \u201cThis may also be a mechanism by which the baby protects itself in the womb from infections of the mother. The next stage of our work will be to better understand the pathways that result in the immune cells of the newborns being so different to those in adults.\u201d\n\nIf they can do this, and learn to trigger the process in infected preemies, they may be able to reduce infant deaths around the world. In the U.S., preterm-related causes of death accounted for 35 percent of all infant deaths in 2009, more than any other single cause. If infants deaths in 2009 were anywhere near 2011\u2019s rate of 24,000, then that\u2019s a lot of babies that could be saved.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "premature, babies, immune, systems, may, not, be, weak, we, think, scientists, find, hidden, store", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Scientists have long believed that premature babies' immune systems were suppressed, but a new study finds they may be stronger than we once thought.", "title": "Preemies' Immune Systems Are Stronger Than We Give Them Credit For", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/premature-babies-immune-systems-may-not-be-weak-we-think-scientists-find-hidden-store-304216", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/09/21/preemie.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Scientists have long believed that premature babies' immune systems were suppressed, but a new study finds they may be stronger than we once thought.", "title": "Preemies' Immune Systems Are Stronger Than We Give Them Credit For", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/premature-babies-immune-systems-may-not-be-weak-we-think-scientists-find-hidden-store-304216", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/09/21/preemie.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/09/21/preemie.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Science/Tech", "published_time": "2014-09-21T14:35:54-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-09-21T14:37:32-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Scientists have long believed that premature babies' immune systems were suppressed, but a new study finds they may be stronger than we once thought."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdfac3\"", "article_summary": "Among these poorly developed life functions are the baby\u2019s immune system, which, for quite some time, doctors believed performed just as poorly.\nA new study, however, suggests that we haven\u2019t been giving the premature baby\u2019s immune system enough credit.\nThe study, from researchers at King\u2019s College London, found that a preemie\u2019s immune system is stronger than once thought, and that it may just work differently than it would in an adult.\nDoctors believed that this immune suppression altered the structure of T cells, which are integral to a properly functioning immune system, and even prevented them from fighting pathogens.\nCharacterized as being born before 37 weeks of pregnancy, nearly one of every eight babies are born premature \u2014 40 weeks is considered full term, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)."}
