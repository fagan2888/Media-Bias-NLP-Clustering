John Barrasso (R-Wyo.), speech, Dec. 18, 2013\n\n\u201cThe Administration is recognizing the grim reality that more Americans have lost health insurance than gained it under Obamacare.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), news release, Dec. 19, 2013\n\nThis is an emerging line by Republicans: More people have \u201clost\u201d health insurance or have \u201ccanceled plans\u201d than who have gained it through the Affordable Care Act, a.k.a. \u201cObamacare.\u201d But Democrats have cried foul, with the House Energy and Commerce Committee minority staff estimating that, as a result of the law, no more than 10,000 people do not have health insurance coverage at the start of the year.\n\nSo, who\u2019s right? Much of it depends on what you count, how you count it and how carefully the attack line is phrased.\n\nThe Facts\n\nLet\u2019s start with Boehner\u2019s tweet, since he linked to a Daily Caller article that wrongly asserted that the law \u201cleft more Americans without coverage than before the law was passed.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s official: #Obamacare debuts with more canceled plans than enrollments\u201d http://t.co/hc216YJ6qW via @DailyCaller \u2014 Speaker John Boehner (@SpeakerBoehner) January 2, 2014\n\nOn its face, this claim by the Daily Caller is wrong because the law included a significant expansion of Medicaid, which in just two months has added as many as 3.9 million people to its rolls. (Because of how states report the numbers, some may have already had coverage. Sean Trende at Real Clear Politics has also raised questions about the 3.9 million figure. Update: There are serious issues with the 3.9 million figure.) The article also incorrectly assumes that everyone whose plan did not meet Affordable Care Act standards but who did not sign up for a plan via the exchanges has been left without coverage.\n\nIn reality, many people who received notices that their plans were canceled were told they would be automatically enrolled into another plan by the same insurance company. (Here\u2019s an example of such a letter, courtesy of our colleagues at PolitiFact.)\n\nIn other words, the person\u2019s health plan was \u201ccanceled\u201d but the person was not left \u201cwithout coverage,\u201d as the Daily Caller asserted. There likely was a seamless transition from one plan to the other, though the premiums might have increased because the ACA requires all plans to have the same basic level of benefits.\n\nThis all goes back to President Obama\u2019s pledge that \u201cif you like your plan, you can keep it.\u201d The Fact Checker gave that claim Four Pinocchios and placed it at the top of the biggest Pinocchios of the year.\n\nOf course, not everyone ended up with essentially the same plan \u2014 or liked the options, either from their insurance company or the Obamacare exchanges. Under intense political pressure, the White House ordered an administrative fix that, depending on the actions of individual states, allowed as many as 2.3 million people with \u201ccanceled plans\u201d to simply stay on their old plan for at least another year. Thus they also did not lose coverage, contrary to the Daily Caller\u2019s claim.\n\n(Before the controversy ever erupted publicly, many states allowed \u201cearly renewals\u201d that in effect allowed people to keep their old plans, usually through the end of 2014. Administration officials thus argue it was not a new concept but basically an extension of an existing timeline.)\n\nJust before the holidays, the administration announced a new catastrophic exemption to fill any remaining gaps in coverage \u2014 estimated to affect as many as 500,000 people.\n\nThough Boehner\u2019s tweet had the same wording as the headline for the Daily Caller\u2019s wrong-headed article, spokesman Brendan Buck says the speaker\u2019s main point is that there were \u201cmore private plans canceled than private plans enrolled in Obamacare.\u201d\n\nBuck said that there is a \u201cDemocratic mindset that as long as there is another plan they\u2019ve found \u2014 whether Obamacare, re-enrollment, or the new catastrophic exemption \u2014 that negates the fact that people had the plan they had \u2014 and potentially liked \u2014 canceled in the first place. From our perspective, that is nothing to overlook. In fact, it goes to one of our central arguments against the law \u2014 the government deciding what constitutes health coverage. The president promised people could keep their plans. And in astounding numbers that proved not to be true.\u201d\n\nBuck\u2019s point is certainly a valid argument, but the problem is that Boehner\u2019s statement (and those of other GOP lawmakers) could be interpreted as saying what the Daily Caller article incorrectly asserted \u2014 that millions of people are lacking coverage, as opposed to being forced into coverage they may not have wanted. (Boehner\u2019s tweet did link to the article, after all.)\n\nIndeed, the number of people who thus far have signed up to receive insurance through the exchanges (2.1 million) is merely a subset of the number of people whose plans were canceled (4.7 million); it makes little sense to compare them because the number of people on exchanges will be a smaller number than the number of people whose plans were not compliant with the law. (At this point, it\u2019s unclear who never had insurance in the first place.) It\u2019s kind of like saying the number of people who only eat apples is smaller than the number of people who only eat apples, oranges or bananas.\n\nWe are primarily examining Boehner\u2019s tweet, but aides to Barrasso and Rubio also defended their statements. Emily Schillinger, spokeswoman for Barrasso, pointed to an Associated Press article that laid out the number of canceled policies in each state, coming up with a total of 4.7 million. The number for Wyoming is 3,200. (Barrasso said \u201cthousands and thousands.\u201d) Regarding Wyoming, the AP also notes: \u201cInsurance companies were given the option to renew, and the state insurance commissioner says most of the older plans will be extended for 2014.\u201d\n\nBarrasso \u201csaid canceled \u2014 because the policies were canceled,\u201d Schillinger said. \u201cThe AP says that thousands of people in Wyoming have had their insurance canceled because of the president\u2019s health-care law. We can\u2019t say how many people have had their policies renewed and extended.\u201d\n\nShe also provided a link to a Wyoming state document showing that 17 insurance companies are either withdrawing from or not actively marketing in Wyoming as a result of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nAlex Conant, a spokesman for Rubio, noted that the senator\u2019s full statement made clear he was referring to the private insurance market and thus was not including Medicaid. \u201cMore Americans have lost their insurance plans (about 4.7 million) than enrolled for insurance through the exchanges (2 million),\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s why the administration offered the fire sale in the final days of the enrollment period \u2014 to try to improve the otherwise embarrassing numbers.\u201d\n\nThe Pinocchio Test\n\nIt is correct, according to the AP\u2019s count, that 4.7 million people received a letter saying that their insurance was canceled. From a political perspective, perhaps it does not matter if the transition to another plan was seamless; they still got a cancellation letter, contrary to the president\u2019s famous pledge. But that does not mean that the 4.7 million figure can be easily compared to the number of people signing up for coverage via the exchanges.\n\nOf these three statements, Barrasso gets the closest to framing it correctly. But it is still a question of apples and oranges because listeners might still be left with the mistaken impression that most people with canceled policies ended up with no health insurance.\n\nFor instance, this would be a more accurate way for Barrasso to talk about what happened:\n\n\u201cMore than 3,000 people in Wyoming had their insurance canceled under the law. We have no idea how many were happy with the insurance choices they were left with, but we do know that there are not as many options in our state and that fewer than 1,000 people have been able to sign up on the Obamacare exchange.\u201d\n\nThis is one of those cases where the exact phrasing could make a big difference in the Pinocchio rating. The Daily Caller article by itself would merit Four Pinocchios, while the actual phrasing of Boehner\u2019s tweet is technically correct but a misleading accounting of apples and oranges. In linking to an obviously mistaken article, Boehner compounds any misunderstandings about the point of his tweet.\n\nMoreover, it is worth remembering the enrollment period is only at the halfway point, so the data are incomplete. If Republicans are trying to claim that more people lost private insurance than gained it under Obamacare, the jury is still out and the verdict won\u2019t be in until April 1.\n\nTwo Pinocchios\n\n\n\n\n\n(About our rating scale)\n\nSend us facts to check by filling out this form\n\nFollow The Fact Checker on Twitter and friend us on Facebook", "article_metadata": {"description": "Republicans increasingly suggest more people have lost health insurance than gained it under Obamacare.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/FactChecker", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Republicans increasingly suggest more people have lost health insurance than gained it under Obamacare.", "title": "The GOP claim that more Americans have lost insurance than gained it under Obamacare", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2014/01/06/the-gop-claim-that-more-americans-have-lost-insurance-than-gained-it-under-obamacare/", "image": "https://images.washingtonpost.com/?url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/ezra-klein/boehnershutdown.JPG&w=1484&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@GlennKesslerWP"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2014/01/06/the-gop-claim-that-more-americans-have-lost-insurance-than-gained-it-under-obamacare/", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "obamacare; affordable care act, aca, obama health care, repeal obamacare, insurance lost, insurance plans, health care debacle, obamacare fact check, if you keep your plan, obama lie of the year, glenn kessler, fact checker, factchecker,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/FactChecker"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "obamacare; affordable care act, aca, obama health care, repeal obamacare, insurance lost, insurance plans, health care debacle, obamacare fact check, if you keep your plan, obama lie of the year, glenn kessler, fact checker, factchecker,"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9498\"", "article_summary": "\u201cMore Americans have lost their insurance plans (about 4.7 million) than enrolled for insurance through the exchanges (2 million),\u201d he said.\n\u201cThe AP says that thousands of people in Wyoming have had their insurance canceled because of the president\u2019s health-care law.\nIf Republicans are trying to claim that more people lost private insurance than gained it under Obamacare, the jury is still out and the verdict won\u2019t be in until April 1.\nFor instance, this would be a more accurate way for Barrasso to talk about what happened:\u201cMore than 3,000 people in Wyoming had their insurance canceled under the law.\nOf course, not everyone ended up with essentially the same plan \u2014 or liked the options, either from their insurance company or the Obamacare exchanges."}
