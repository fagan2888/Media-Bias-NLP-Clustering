But in Fremont County, the rates are on the rise.\n\nThe teen pregnancy rate in Fremont County has risen almost 15% from 2005 to 2012. The current rate is about 70 teen births per 1000.\n\n\u201cIt's kind of hard to understand why statistically we're having more teen pregnancies when in fact, because of potential coverage out there, prevention, we should be having less,\u201d says Patricia DeClue, Lander Medical Clinic\n\nDeClue says it's frustrating as a medical provider to see the rising rates because through the Affordable Care Act... Birth control is easier to get.\n\n\u201cThere's been comments like, I just want to have someone that loves me and having a baby is a way to have someone that loves me. So you know, there's those things that our society's actually letting it become more acceptable,\u201d says DeClue\n\nAccording to a study from the Wyoming Department of Health, only 50% of teen mothers receive a high school diploma by the age of 22 and less than 2% earn a bachelor's degree by age 30. Babies born to teens are more likely to have a low birth rate, more likely to repeat a grade, and more likely to become a teen mother.\n\n\u201cWe're seeing higher pregnancy rates among Hispanics as well as Native Americans, being much higher than the white pregnancy rates, so and that could also be a question of access,\u201d says Jamie Cardine, Fremont County Family Planning\n\nCardine says through Fremont County Family Planning, nurses are trying to raise awareness for different forms of birth control.\n\n\u201cFor teenagers they're really starting to push the long acting removable methods that last anywhere from 3 to 10 years. So that could get a teenager through high school and possibly even college,\u201d says Cardine.\n\nIn 2012, the national rate of teen pregnancy was about 30 births per 1000 girls and in Wyoming it was a little under 35 births per 1000 girls.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "Rates across the Nation and Wyoming are declining, but in Fremont County, the rates are rising.", "language": "english", "author": "Jenna Jackson", "og": {"url": "http://www.kcwy13.com/home/headlines/Teen-Pregnancy-Rate-Rises-in-Fremont-County-289931461.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/561*315/teenpregup2.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Rates across the Nation and Wyoming are declining, but in Fremont County, the rates are rising.", "title": "Teen Pregnancy Rate Rises in Fremont County"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.kcwy13.com", "description": "Rates across the Nation and Wyoming are declining, but in Fremont County, the rates are rising.", "creator": "@TodayinWyoming", "url": "http://www.kcwy13.com/home/headlines/Teen-Pregnancy-Rate-Rises-in-Fremont-County-289931461.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/teenpregup.jpg", "title": "Teen Pregnancy Rate Rises in Fremont County", "site": "@TodayinWyoming", "card": "summary"}, "keywords": "Teen Pregnancy Rate Rises in Fremont County", "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "google-site-verification": "iHF34u0QujH2nTH20nVBgdlPakhwvJ-yNZMvMGPtin4", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Teen Pregnancy Rate Rises in"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd74d4\"", "article_summary": "The teen pregnancy rate in Fremont County has risen almost 15% from 2005 to 2012.\nThe teen pregnancy rate across the Nation and Wyoming is declining...\n\u201cWe're seeing higher pregnancy rates among Hispanics as well as Native Americans, being much higher than the white pregnancy rates, so and that could also be a question of access,\u201d says Jamie Cardine, Fremont County Family PlanningCardine says through Fremont County Family Planning, nurses are trying to raise awareness for different forms of birth control.\nBut in Fremont County, the rates are on the rise.\nIn 2012, the national rate of teen pregnancy was about 30 births per 1000 girls and in Wyoming it was a little under 35 births per 1000 girls."}
