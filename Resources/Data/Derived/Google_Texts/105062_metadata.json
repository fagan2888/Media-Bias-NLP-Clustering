These are the biggest job-creators, and their slump is a key reason for the sub-par labor recovery, with low participation rates and high numbers of involuntary part-time workers.\n\nSo if investment is the problem, what does Hillary Clinton go out and do? She proposes jacking up the tax on investment. It\u2019s almost inconceivably stupid.\n\nIn her latest economic speech, Clinton proposes doubling the capital-gains tax rate on the profit made from asset sales (stocks, bonds, real estate) held a day less than one year up to two years. Right now, if you take a capital gain a day more than one year, you are taxed at a 20 percent rate. Actually, it\u2019s 23.8 percent when you include the health-care surtax. So under Clinton\u2019s brilliant new play, you\u2019d be taxed at 43.4 percent \u2014 the top individual cap-gains rate of 39.6 percent plus the 3.8 percent Obamacare surtax.\n\nThat means, instead of keeping 80 cents on the additional dollar of profit, you\u2019d only keep 56.6 cents \u2014 a 30-percentage-point reduction in the take-home-pay reward for taking an extra dollar\u2019s investment risk.\n\nThis will create a tall barrier to investment \u2014 what we don\u2019t need. If you tax something more, you get less of it.\n\nClinton complains about too much \u201cshort-termism\u201d in the economy. But her program might well create more of it. That\u2019s because she has a sliding tax-rate scale, whereby assets held two to three years would be taxed at 39.8 percent and assets held three to four years at 35.8 percent. And you don\u2019t get back to the statutory 20 percent cap-gains rate unless you hold an asset for six-plus years.\n\nWho\u2019s going to lock themselves into that? What if new investment opportunities arise? Want to convert your current holding into cash so you can invest in your brother-in-law\u2019s start-up? Maybe it\u2019s the next Facebook. Who knows? The point is, the Clinton plan exacts a huge tax penalty on the movement from old capital to new.\n\nThe late Jude Wanniski called this re-oxygenating the economy. Ms. Clinton would snuff that out. Her short-termism fear will lock us into long-term economic stagnation.\n\nBy the way, the numbers are actually worse, because capital gains are already taxed as corporate profits. What investors pay is a double tax.\n\nSo let\u2019s go back to Hillary\u2019s top cap-gains rate of 43.8 percent. The government takes 35 percent of your profit in corporate taxes, leaving 65 cents to be taxed a second time as capital gains at the new 43.8 percent rate. That results in a take-home profit of 37 cents on the dollar.\n\nIs that enough to reward the risk of investing in the next Uber? Except for Mayor Bill de Blasio, who hates Uber, most people would say no.\n\nBut that\u2019s Hillary\u2019s plan.\n\nHow powerful is the capital-gains tax? The non-partisan Tax Foundation rates it among the top three economic-growth influences on the economy, along with full cash expensing for new investment in plants and equipment and the corporate tax. And compared with the rest of the world, the U.S. has fallen far behind in terms of this investment-tax-penalty grouping.\n\nThis is government tinkering at its worst. The reality is that Hillary Clinton is attempting to punish success and redistribute income.\n\nDid someone say tax the rich? Clinton proposes an income threshold of $484,850 for married couples filing jointly. Oh my gosh! Successful economic activists! Let\u2019s get \u2019em!\n\nIronically, history shows that periods of higher capital-gains tax rates produce less revenue as a share of all federal revenue and as a fraction of GDP. Hillary\u2019s not even redistributing efficiently.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s what some call the \u201cCharles Gibson effect.\u201d Gibson interviewed then-Senator Obama in 2008 for ABC News. Obama said he\u2019d raise the cap-gains tax from 15 to 28 percent. But Gibson reminded Obama that when Bill Clinton and George Bush lowered cap-gains tax rates, revenues actually increased. In other words, the Laffer curve. But Obama said it didn\u2019t matter because he wanted to be \u201cfair.\u201d\n\nIt also doesn\u2019t matter to Hillary. She wants to beat Bernie Sanders, or at least cuddle up to the Vermont socialist. What nonsense. Bad economics and bad politics. Voters will understand this.\n\nGoofy ideas like this make me yearn for a 15 percent flat-tax rate on everything. Personal income, corporate profits, capital gains, dividends \u2014 everything. But that still leaves me with a double-tax problem for investment and savings. So it\u2019s probably time to blow up the corporate-tax code altogether. That would get us to the 4-percent-plus growth path advocated by some of the Republicans on the campaign trail.\n\nAnd that would get us some \u201clong-termism\u201d economic growth \u2014 just what the country yearns for.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Human Events", "description": "Her \u201cshort-termism\u201d fear will lead to long-term stagnation.", "title": "Hillary\u2019s Inconceivably Stupid Capital-Gains Tax Scheme | Human Events", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://humanevents.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/hillaryclinton-620x348-480x269.jpg", "url": "http://humanevents.com/2015/07/27/hillarys-inconceivably-stupid-capital-gains-tax-scheme/", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"pages": 212436860202}, "description": "Her \u201cshort-termism\u201d fear will lead to long-term stagnation.", "twitter": {"image": "http://humanevents.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/hillaryclinton-620x348-480x269.jpg", "site": "@humanevents", "card": "summary", "description": "Her \u201cshort-termism\u201d fear will lead to long-term stagnation."}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1fa4\"", "article_summary": "Ironically, history shows that periods of higher capital-gains tax rates produce less revenue as a share of all federal revenue and as a fraction of GDP.\nAnd you don\u2019t get back to the statutory 20 percent cap-gains rate unless you hold an asset for six-plus years.\nBut Gibson reminded Obama that when Bill Clinton and George Bush lowered cap-gains tax rates, revenues actually increased.\nSo let\u2019s go back to Hillary\u2019s top cap-gains rate of 43.8 percent.\nObama said he\u2019d raise the cap-gains tax from 15 to 28 percent."}
