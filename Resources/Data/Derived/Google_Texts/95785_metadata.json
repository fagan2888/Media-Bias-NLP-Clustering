Which means we have to be a lot more productive, workforce participation has to rise from its all-time modern lows. It means that people need to work longer hours\u201d and, through their productivity, gain more income for their families. That\u2019s the only way we\u2019re going to get out of this rut that we\u2019re in.\u201d\n\nEconomist Chris Butler of Butler Lanz & Wagler told Talk Radio 1210 WPHT morning host Chris Stigall that Bush is right.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s only two ways an economy can grow\u2026You either have to have more people working, in other words, more hours or they have to be able to be making more stuff per hour that they\u2019re working and that was his point, or at least what I took to be his point. He\u2019s right, he\u2019s just stating ECON 101 stuff here that there\u2019s only two ways to grow an economy, you have to have more people working or they have to be more productive with the tools that they have.\u201d\n\nButler feels that the reason that our economy is in the position that it is in where people need to work more hours, is that we are in a \u201cpart-time economy.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe reason that we have a part-time economy, and by the way, we do have a part-time economy is because of the stuff we\u2019ve done to ourselves, it\u2019s because we\u2019ve shot ourselves in the foot not only with the Affordable Care Act, but a whole host of legislation that disincentives people to actually work. I mean, that\u2019s it. It\u2019s very simple.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Presidential hopeful and former Florida Governor Jeb Bush was recorded saying with New Hampshire\u2019s The Union Leader that people need to work longer hours and is under fire for his comments.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"url": "http://philadelphia.cbslocal.com/2015/07/10/chris-butler-agrees-with-jeb-bushs-people-need-to-work-more-hours-comment/", "image": {"width": 1500, "secure_url": "https://cbsphilly.files.wordpress.com/2015/07/jeb-bush.jpg?w=1500", "identifier": "https://cbsphilly.files.wordpress.com/2015/07/jeb-bush.jpg?w=1500", "height": 990}, "type": "article", "description": "Presidential hopeful and former Florida Governor Jeb Bush was recorded saying with New Hampshire\u2019s The Union Leader that people need to work longer hours and is under fire for his comments.", "title": "Chris Butler Agrees With Jeb Bush's 'People Need To Work More Hours' Comment"}, "twitter": {"site": "CBSphilly", "image": "https://cbsphilly.files.wordpress.com/2015/07/jeb-bush.jpg?w=1500", "description": "Presidential hopeful and former Florida Governor Jeb Bush was recorded saying with New Hampshire\u2019s The Union Leader that people need to work longer hours and is under fire for his comments.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Chris Butler Agrees With Jeb Bush's 'People Need To Work More Hours' Comment"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "News, Sports, Weather, Traffic and Philly's Top Spots", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "application-name": "CBS Philly", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/cbsphilly", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/cbsphilly"}, "keywords": "audio, heard on, politics, wpht, chris butler, chris stigall, jeb bush, talk radio 1210 wpht", "google-site-verification": "44caXBf4kjHeKKAT7ZZ89NaCX25utL_yRSa-qGpwIhY", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://philadelphia.cbslocal.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/40f9fbf792243f0932e0cab4dbd46d10?s=16", "news_keywords": "chris butler, chris stigall, jeb bush, talk radio 1210 wpht"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdfa51\"", "article_summary": "It means that people need to work longer hours\u201d and, through their productivity, gain more income for their families.\nBy Chris StigallPHILADELPHIA (CBS) \u2014 Presidential hopeful and former Florida Governor Jeb Bush was recorded saying with New Hampshire\u2019s The Union Leader that people need to work longer hours and is under fire for his comments.\nWhich means we have to be a lot more productive, workforce participation has to rise from its all-time modern lows.\n\u201cMy aspiration for the country and I believe we can achieve it, is four percent growth as far as the eye can see.\nThat\u2019s the only way we\u2019re going to get out of this rut that we\u2019re in.\u201dEconomist Chris Butler of Butler Lanz & Wagler told Talk Radio 1210 WPHT morning host Chris Stigall that Bush is right."}
