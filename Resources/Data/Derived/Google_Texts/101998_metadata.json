As a result, nearly 300,000 low-income Ohioans\u2014mostly working adults living near or below the federal poverty level\u2014will qualify for basic health coverage starting January 1.\n\nThe breakthrough came Monday afternoon, when the Ohio legislature\u2019s seven-member \u201ccontrolling board\u201d voted to let Kasich spend the $2.5 billion the federal government has approved for his expansion plan. Ohio is the 26th jurisdiction to commit itself to expanding health care for the poor. By the Advisory Board\u2019s latest count, 28 states and the District of Columbia are now moving toward expansion.\n\nOhio\u2019s decision ends a nine-month standoff between Kasich and the right far-right flank of his party, and it provides welcome solace to a White House embarrassed by the botched debut of its new online insurance exchanges.\n\n\u201cGovernor Kasich will join a number of other Republican governors in putting aside partisan politics, and recognizing the practical and economic benefits of supporting Medicaid expansion,\u201d Obama aide and Ohio native Chris Jennings wrote in a White House blog post Monday night. \u201cThis is great news for the 270,000 previously uninsured residents, the state\u2019s health care providers, and [the] Ohio economy, [which] will benefit from this expansion.\u201d\n\nLike other GOP governors including Arizona\u2019s Jan Brewer, Florida\u2019s Rick Scott and New Jersey\u2019s Chris Christie, Kasich decided last winter that his state couldn\u2019t afford to turn down federally funded health coverage for uninsured constituents who cost the state millions in unpaid emergency medical bills. But when Kasich included the expansion in his budget proposal last spring, Republican legislators promptly stripped it out of the bill.\n\nKasich didn\u2019t back down. Unlike Rick Scott, who ditched a similar bid when Florida legislators balked, Kasich and his administration continued to work on a detailed blueprint for expansion. Research from the Health Policy Institute of Ohio and others predicted huge benefits to the state\u2019s economy as well as its health, and public support surged. By last summer, a statewide ballot initiative was in the works, and groups from across the political spectrum\u2014from the Ohio Poverty Law Center to the chamber of commerce, the state medical association and Catholic Diocese\u2014were speaking out in unison.\n\n\u201cI believe [expanding Medicaid] is a matter of life and death,\u201d Kasich told the Cincinnati Enquirer in July. \u201cIt\u2019s going to happen. It\u2019s just a matter of when.\u201d\n\nGiven enough time, the legislature or the voters might have cleared the way. But rather than wait for them, Kasich found a way around the politics. This month, when the federal government formally approved his administration\u2019s Medicaid expansion plan, he asked the legislature\u2019s controlling board simply to authorize use of the available funds\u2014all $2.5 billion of them. The board members didn\u2019t have to approve the governor\u2019s whole scheme to expand Medicaid. They simply signed off, in a 5-to-2 vote, on the transfer of a pending federal disbursement into the state\u2019s Medicaid account.\n\nThe spurned GOP legislators aren\u2019t amused. More than half of the Republicans in Ohio\u2019s state House have signed a resolution to protest the governor\u2019s end run, and the senate president is threatening legislation to curb the controlling board\u2019s authority in the future.\n\nBut the country\u2019s seventh most populous state is now on the road to health care reform. \u201cThis is great news for the 300,000 Ohioans who will now be eligible for Medicaid,\u201d says Gene King, director of the Ohio Poverty Law Center. \u201cTomorrow, we can start work on outreach and enrollment.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "Republican Governor Kasich bucks his party and expands the state's Medicaid coverage.", "original-source": "http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/ohio-medicaid-expansion", "og": {"site_name": "MSNBC", "description": "Republican Governor Kasich bucks his party and expands the state's Medicaid coverage.", "title": "Obamacare wins in Ohio as John Kasich expands state's Medicaid coverage", "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/ohio-medicaid-expansion", "image": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/articles/140685340_0.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "msnbc.com", "account_id": 2836421, "creator": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/ohio-medicaid-expansion", "image": {"width": 830, "identifier": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--3-2--512x342/public/articles/140685340_0.jpg?itok=LzMJWK0Q", "height": 553}, "title": "Obamacare wins in Ohio as John Kasich expands state's Medicaid coverage", "site": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Republican Governor Kasich bucks his party and expands the state's Medicaid coverage."}, "robots": "follow, index", "DC.date.issued": "2013-10-22T00:45:00-04:00", "jenga-session-config": "{\"when_to_init\":\"after_dom_ready\"}", "fb": {"app_id": 351594351545594}, "nv": {"author": "geoffreycowley", "title": "Obamacare wins in Ohio as John Kasich expands state's Medicaid coverage", "address": "http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/ohio-medicaid-expansion", "published": 1, "date": "10/22/2013 00:45:00 EDT", "tags": "health,health-care-policy,health-care-reform,obamacare,ohio,republican-party,republicans"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/msnbc", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/msnbc"}, "abstract": "Republican Governor Kasich bucks his party and expands the state's Medicaid coverage.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Health, Health Care Reform, Republicans, Health Care Policy, Obamacare, Ohio, Republican Party"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe03f2\"", "article_summary": "They simply signed off, in a 5-to-2 vote, on the transfer of a pending federal disbursement into the state\u2019s Medicaid account.\nHe had to circumvent his own Republican legislature to do it, but Ohio\u2019s Republican governor, John Kasich, succeeded Monday in a year-long quest to expand his state\u2019s Medicaid program under the Affordable Care Act.\nBy the Advisory Board\u2019s latest count, 28 states and the District of Columbia are now moving toward expansion.\nBut when Kasich included the expansion in his budget proposal last spring, Republican legislators promptly stripped it out of the bill.\n\u201cI believe [expanding Medicaid] is a matter of life and death,\u201d Kasich told the Cincinnati Enquirer in July."}
