Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida, chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee, headlined a rally in Portland on Monday to mobilize Maine women voters on behalf of the state\u2019s candidates for Congress and governor.\n\nShe and other Democrats criticized the Supreme Court\u2019s Hobby Lobby ruling that allows closely held corporations to opt out, for religious reasons, of an Affordable Care Act requirement that they provide contraception coverage for women employees.\n\nThey also focused on the need to raise the minimum wage and ensure equal pay for equal work, while highlighting the need to put more women in elected office.\n\nWasserman Schultz spent most of her time speaking in support of Emily Cain\u2019s candidacy for the 2nd Congressional District seat against Republican Bruce Poliquin.\n\nMore than 50 people, mostly women, attended.\n\nWasserman Schultz also talked about the governor\u2019s race among Republican Gov. Paul LePage, Democratic U.S. Rep. Mike Michaud and independent Eliot Cutler, casting the incumbent as a tea party icon.\n\n\u201cThe other choice is the Republican Party, which has been in the midst of a civil war that the tea party has clearly won,\u201d Wasserman Schultz said at the Portland Public Library. \u201cTheir champion is Gov. LePage. So, we need to tell the poster child of the tea party that his time here is done. That 2010 was an anomaly.\u201d\n\nBrent Littlefield, LePage\u2019s political adviser, suggested in an email that Maine Democrats were trying to\n\ndistract voters from the governor\u2019s record of job creation and efforts to end domestic violence.\n\n\u201cThis is just another example of partisanship at any cost for Mike Michaud and his Democratic team,\u201d Littlefield wrote. \u201cThey ignore the fact that over 20,000 new private sector jobs have been created since Governor LePage took office and Maine now has a Governor who is focusing on ending domestic violence.\u201d\n\nCutler\u2019s campaign used the event to highlight Michaud\u2019s so-called \u201cevolution\u201d on reproductive rights and equality issues, saying big name Democrats \u201ccan\u2019t paper over Mike Michaud\u2019s sorry 30-year record on issues that are important to women.\u201d\n\n\u201cMaine\u2019s women are watching and listening today \u2013 and I am certain they won\u2019t be fooled by this charade,\u201d Cutler campaign manager Ted O\u2019Meara said in an email. \u201cWe are confident that when Maine citizens finally get a chance to see the candidates debate the issues facing our state, they will overwhelmingly choose Eliot as the leader Maine needs.\u201d\n\nThe rally highlighted Democratic positions on women\u2019s issues, such as equal pay, raising the minimum wage and access to health care.\n\nWomen are considered a key voting bloc in Maine, especially for Democrats.\n\n\u201cWhen women vote, Democrats win,\u201d Wasserman Schultz said after the rally.\n\nDuring the rally, she said the Hobby Lobby decision, along with Republican opposition to raising the minimum wage and bills that would ensure equal pay for equal work, are reasons why Cain should take Michaud\u2019s seat in Congress.\n\nHaving more women in office, she said, is key to ending dysfunction in the national capitol.\n\n\u201cI am just so excited to have her come down to D.C. and fight side-by-side with us, because we are in a hell of a fight,\u201d Wasserman Schultz said.\n\nCain said that raising the minimum wage is important, because the majority of minimum wage earners are women. Also, income inequality \u2013 she said a woman in Maine earns only 80 cents for every $1 a man makes \u2013 is holding back the economy.\n\n\u201cThere is so much at stake,\u201d said Cain, noting that if elected she would be the first female Democrat to represent 2nd district. \u201cThe role of women in the economy is essential to how we\u2019re going to be successful as a state.\u201d\n\nU.S. Rep. Chellie Pingree, who is being challenged by 25-year-old Republican Isaac Misiuk, was also on hand. Pingree and Michaud are co-sponsors of a bill that would reverse the Hobby Lobby ruling.\n\nMichaud left the rally early so he could return to Washington to finishing working on a compromise bill designed to increase access to health care for veterans and improve accountability within the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs.\n\nShenna Bellows, who is trying to unseat U.S. Sen. Susan Collins, also did not attend; she is currently on a 350-mile \u201cWalk Across Maine\u201d from Houlton to Kittery.\n\nRandy Billings can be contacted at 791-6346 or at:\n\n[email protected]\n\nTwitter: @randybillings", "article_metadata": {"description": "The head of the Democratic National Committee stumps in Portland for Emily Cain and Mike Michaud.", "generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "description": "The head of the Democratic National Committee stumps in Portland for Emily Cain and Mike Michaud.", "title": "Democrats try to mobilize Maine women's vote - The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 1000, "identifier": "http://www.pressherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/476518_81748-20140728_democrat_073.jpg", "height": 667}, "updated_time": "2014-07-29T10:10:25-04:00", "url": "http://www.pressherald.com/2014/07/29/dnc-chair-will-headline-womens-rally-in-portland/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The head of the Democratic National Committee stumps in Portland for Emily Cain and Mike Michaud.", "title": "Democrats try to mobilize Maine women's vote - The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "image": "http://www.pressherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/476518_81748-20140728_democrat_073.jpg", "creator": "@pressherald", "site": "@pressherald", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=951845858", "fb": {"admins": 769488179, "app_id": 178078215650057}, "google-site-verification": "QWs9pxQP8fwo2-nR5mWopc6qCK2D3920f7bl-U-zkso", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/pressherald", "section": "Local & State", "published_time": "2014-07-29T09:30:17-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-07-29T10:10:25-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdec7c\"", "article_summary": "Cain said that raising the minimum wage is important, because the majority of minimum wage earners are women.\n\u201cThe other choice is the Republican Party, which has been in the midst of a civil war that the tea party has clearly won,\u201d Wasserman Schultz said at the Portland Public Library.\nWasserman Schultz spent most of her time speaking in support of Emily Cain\u2019s candidacy for the 2nd Congressional District seat against Republican Bruce Poliquin.\nU.S. Rep.
