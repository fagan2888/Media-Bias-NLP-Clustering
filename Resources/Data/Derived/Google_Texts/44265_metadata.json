He says he was officially let go in July 2012 after being asked to train his replacement, a man half his age.\n\nJoseph Golden, Rosenthal\u2019s lawyer, disputes Faygo\u2019s claim that Rosenthal was an independent contractor \u2013 and therefore not covered by the 1967 Age Discrimination in Employment Act. Golden argues that his client was a regular employee at Faygo and his coworkers were aware of that fact.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d always wanted to work at Faygo,\u201d Rosenthal told the Detroit Free Press. \u201cIt\u2019s sort of in my blood.\u201d\n\nFaygo Beverages Inc. did not respond to an email requesting comment on the lawsuit.\n\n>> Sign up for the AARP Money newsletter\n\nPhoto: Dwight Burdette (Wikipedia)\n\nAlso of Interest\n\nSee the AARP home page for deals, savings tips, trivia and more", "article_metadata": {"page_title": "blog", "twitter": {"description": "Detroit-based Faygo, a fixture in the soft drink industry since 1907, is being sued for age discrimination by the grandson of one of the company\u2019s founders.
