He knows that if it does, and ultimately becomes law, it will mean working out the bugs at his job.\n\nFrischmann, chief of unemployment insurance operations at Nevada Department of Employment, Training and Rehabilitation, is confident, though, as he anticipates the flood of people returning to the system to file claims.\n\n\"We would stand ready and do it. ... We\u2019ll get through it, just like we have in the past.\"\n\nSenate Majority Leader Harry Reid will bring the most promising version yet of legislation to extend benefit funding, which ran dry in December, to the Senate floor this week. Its chances of passing are good, but the long-term prognosis for the bill is dimmer.\n\nHouse Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, last week called the measure \u201csimply unworkable.\u201d\n\nTen senators led by Jack Reed, D-R.I., and Dean Heller, R-Nev., cobbled together the latest bill expressly to draw a filibuster-proof majority in the Senate. Five Republican senators have pledged to vote for it, and positive signs from more conservative Democrats indicate the bill will get just the 60 votes necessary to keep it alive.\n\nBut Boehner is balking because of concerns raised by a group representing state workforce agencies that trying to restore benefits dating to December would cause significant processing problems.\n\nIn Nevada, Frischmann recalled that a previous time Congress had difficulty passing an unemployment extension, the rush to file claims caused major delays \u2014 even with extended hours and accelerated processing schedules.\n\n\u201cI would estimate probably about 35,000 to 40,000 claimants (would) come back into the system,\u201d Frischmann said. \u201cOnce you open up that floodgate, that\u2019s a whole lot of people to take care of on a Monday morning.\u201d\n\nBefore funding for unemployment benefits lapsed in December, the Nevada agency was processing about 30,000 emergency benefits claims and 20,000 regular claims in a given week.\n\nJust six months ago, Nevada workforce officials spent $35 million to upgrade what was a 15-year old unemployment claims processing system. Frischmann says the system has automated, for the most part, how people switch from tier to tier of their unemployment eligibility, so he doesn\u2019t expect many hiccups in that part of processing. But he does expect delays that might come with running so many claims through the system.\n\nFor months, the agency tried to head off that problem by encouraging jobless workers to continue to file claims through March 1.\n\nSince then, it has been telling would-be emergency benefit claimants to stop filing \u2014 with no information available as to when they might restart.\n\nThat could create some problems for processing claims once things come back online \u2014 not because of the system, but because of the confusion it would cause for people who will have to prove they were playing by the rules even when they weren\u2019t actively filing for benefits, Frischmann said.\n\n\u201cEach week, a UI claimant must log, or track, or keep a list of where they looked for work and what their work search looked like,\u201d he said. \u201cPart of the challenge that these poor folks are going to hit is that when they didn\u2019t have the benefits, there were no requirements. But now we\u2019re going to set retroactive requirements \u2026 that (are) going to make the process really difficult when you think about going back months.\u201d\n\nAnother potential problem cited by Boehner last week is that state claims processing systems don\u2019t contain enough data to satisfy certain requirements in the bill, such as the provision denying benefits to millionaires.\n\nFor example: Nevada\u2019s workforce agency keeps data on raw wages, but it doesn\u2019t keep tax returns \u2013 making it all but impossible to determine who would count as a \u201cmillionaire\u201d under that exclusion.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not the IRS,\u201d Frischmann said.\n\nFor Nevadans, being discouraged from filing claims comes as an alarm that perhaps the missed checks won\u2019t come after all, despite the best intentions of the state delegation.\n\nJobless workers in Nevada, which in January posted an 8.7 percent unemployment rate, would remain eligible for the maximum 73 weeks of benefits had federal funding for the emergency tiers been approved. The state covers the first 26 weeks; everything beyond that is considered emergency benefits, and the federal government foots the bill.\n\nBut those who were in the longest-term tiers would be coming up to the end of their eligibility. With that in mind, senators are preparing to pass their bill out of the Senate this week despite the cold shoulder from the House speaker.\n\nAfter that, the fate of the bill may rest largely on Hail Mary mechanics in the House.\n\nBefore last week\u2019s recess, Democratic lawmakers in the House filed a discharge petition to bring up unemployment legislation. So far, 191 \u2014 including Nevada Reps. Steven Horsford and Dina Titus \u2014 have signed on. But 218 signatures are necessary to force Boehner to schedule the matter for a vote, and there has thus far been no interest from Republicans.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Senate will try again this week to approve legislation to restore federal funding for emergency unemployment benefits.
