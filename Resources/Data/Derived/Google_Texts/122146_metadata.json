(AP) - Thirteen-year-old Colleen Lance asked Alexandra Tenneboe what her favorite holiday was and what food she liked to eat on that holiday.\n\nAlexandra said it was Christmas, and she liked eating pinnekjott, which is a popular dish in Norway. She described it as dried ribs with an array of spices.\n\n\u201cOK, you are making me hungry,\u201d Colleen said with a laugh and a smile. \u201cI also like Christmas.\u201d\n\nColleen told Alexandra that she enjoys eating ham, potatoes and cookies on Christmas.\n\nIt was a typical interaction between two teen friends - who happen to live about 7,000 miles apart.\n\nColleen was seated in a red chair along with a dozen classmates huddled near a laptop, microphone and web camera. The eighth-graders at Ss. Peter and Paul Catholic School in Waterloo were videoconferencing with a group of students in Norway.\n\nThe Norwegian students stayed two hours after school to be able to talk to their keypals - the high-tech version of pen pals. It was 9:30 a.m. in Waterloo and 4:30 p.m. Norwegian time.\n\nEach student had the chance to ask his keypals one question. Questions ranged from what sports do you play to do you watch videos on YouTube?\n\nThe eighth-graders at Ss. Peter and Paul are all students in an international studies class taught by Bill Theobald on Wednesdays. Theobald is a retired Waterloo School District teacher who stepped back into the classroom this year at the private Catholic school in town to educate the students on different countries, cultures and communities. Theobald teaches four International Studies courses - one for each junior high grade level: fifth, sixth, seventh and eighth.\n\nBefore the videoconferencing with the Norway school began, Theobald reminded the students to speak slowly and enunciate clearly.\n\nEighth-grader Will Janson, 13, of Waterloo, welcomed Norwegian teacher Kathrine Kopperud and her class.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s amazing the picture and sound from 7,000 miles away,\u201d Theobald said as the students began asking their keypals their questions. \u201cThe world is so small.\u201d\n\nTo keep the videoconferencing moving, Theobald wrote up a script for the students, which he shared with Kopperud and her class via e-mail.\n\nWill asked his keypal Lucas Morken if the school has any sports teams.\n\n\u201cThe school does not have any sports teams,\u201d Lucas said. \u201cIf you want to play a sport, you have to join a private club after school.\u201d\n\nWaterloo students asked if the Norwegian students had to wear school uniforms like they did. They don\u2019t.\n\n\u201cThey wear the same things you do and the same brands,\u201d Kopperud answered.\n\nAlexandra wore her national costume - a bunad - to show the Waterloo students what it looked like. Alexandra said it is common to wear bunad for special occasions like weddings, baptisms, confirmations and especially May 17, Norway\u2019s National Day.\n\nThe costume included a Hardangerbunad, which consisted of a dress called a stakk made out of wool, a white shirt, and a white apron with embroidery and a belt with beads sewn on.\n\nThe Norwegian students, who spoke very good English, gave a brief language lesson.\n\n\u201cHi\u201d in Norwegian is \u201chei.\u201d\n\n\u201cGoodbye\u201d is \u201cha det.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is your name\u201d is \u201chva heter du?\u201d\n\n\u201cMy name is\u201d is \u201cjeg heter.\u201d\n\nThe Waterloo students had a difficult time pronouncing Norwegian words.\n\nColleen asked Kopperud how many students are in each class at their school. \u201cBetween 25 and 30,\u201d Kopperud said. \u201cThis class is an elective subject so there\u2019s not as many.\u201d\n\nColleen told her there are 30 students total in the eighth-grade at Ss. Peter and Paul, and classes have between 13 and 14 students.\n\nTheobald asked Kopperud and her students if they would like to video conference again before Christmas, and they all agreed. He suggested they sing Christmas songs next time.\n\nAfterward, Colleen said the video conference was fun. \u201cI like meeting new people, and it\u2019s interesting to learn about people in other cultures,\u201d she said.\n\nLillie Roever, 13, of Waterloo, said it was \u201ccool to finally see them after emailing for a while.\u201d\n\nEmelia O\u2019Neill, 14, of Smithton, was impressed by how well Norwegian students spoke English. \u201cIt was really cool to see they could speak English a lot better than I thought they would,\u201d she said.\n\nEmelia enjoys communicating with students in other countries. \u201cA lot of the things they do are the same as we do,\u201d she said, \u201cand they like a lot of the same things we do.\u201d\n\nLike the eighth-graders, the fifth-through-seventh graders enrolled in international studies this semester also have keypals. For instance, sixth-graders communicate with students at Aberdeen Composite School in Saskatchewan, Canada, and seventh-graders with students at a school in Cassis, France, called College Les Gorguettes.\n\nTo network with classes around the world, Theobald uses programs including E. Pals, Skype and Edmodo. What makes it possible is the technology, according to Theobald. \u201cIt\u2019s all free so schools can afford it,\u201d he said.\n\nDuring the semester-long international studies class, students complete a series of projects while studying geography and current events.\n\nEmelia enjoys watching CNN Student News in class, which helps her be better informed about what\u2019s happening in the world. \u201cI learn a lot more about what\u2019s going on,\u201d she said.\n\nLillie likes the international studies class. \u201cIt\u2019s cool, because we get to learn about things happening in other countries,\u201d she said. \u201cYou get to see people in other countries are like the same and not that much different.\u201d\n\n___\n\nSource: Belleville News-Democrat, http://bit.ly/1wA1voE\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Belleville News-Democrat, http://www.bnd.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "Thirteen-year-old Colleen Lance asked Alexandra Tenneboe what her favorite holiday was and what food she liked to eat on that holiday.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Thirteen-year-old Colleen Lance asked Alexandra Tenneboe what her favorite holiday was and what food she liked to eat on that holiday.", "title": "EXCHANGE: Illinois, Norwegian students communicate", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jan/4/exchange-illinois-norwegian-students-communicate/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/01/04/884c8b6ba9884e006a0f6a70670078c9.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/01/04/884c8b6ba9884e006a0f6a70670078c9.jpg", "description": "Thirteen-year-old Colleen Lance asked Alexandra Tenneboe what her favorite holiday was and what food she liked to eat on that holiday.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "EXCHANGE: Illinois, Norwegian students communicate"}, "Author": "JAMIE FORSYTHE", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe26f5\"", "article_summary": "During the semester-long international studies class, students complete a series of projects while studying geography and current events.\nThe Norwegian students stayed two hours after school to be able to talk to their keypals - the high-tech version of pen pals.\n\u201cIf you want to play a sport, you have to join a private club after school.\u201dWaterloo students asked if the Norwegian students had to wear school uniforms like they did.\nThe Norwegian students, who spoke very good English, gave a brief language lesson.\nTheobald asked Kopperud and her students if they would like to video conference again before Christmas, and they all agreed."}
