And I would like to make sure we have a plan in place that is time-sensitive -- that makes absolutely certain we maximize the dollars for health care in Louisiana.\"\n\nEver since Gov. Bobby Jindal announced in 2013 that he'd reject the option to accept federal Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act, legislators have spent little time understanding the complexities of the state's Medicaid program. Even if they had spent time discussing the program, legislators have said, any attempt to expand Medicaid would have been met with a gubernatorial veto.\n\nKnowing that Edwards has made Medicaid expansion among his highest priorities, they spent two hours Monday going over the program's costs, expressing concern over federal reductions in funding for the former charity hospital system and exploring what other states have done to customize their expanded Medicaid program.\n\nAll of that discussion comes amid worries over a $530 million shortfall in Louisiana's current Medicaid budget, driven by higher-than-expected enrollment in the Bayou Health insurance program that serves mostly children and pregnant women. The state's share of that shortfall is $190.5 million, which DHH undersecretary Jeff Reynolds said was being addressed \"with the current administration and look forward to working with the new administration coming in\" to find a solution.\n\nDHH officials plan to meet with Edwards' transition team members on Monday.\n\nEnrollment could surge for Medicaid expansion too, Senate Finance members were warned, with more than 300,000 uninsured people projected to qualify for the program.\n\nAnother 200,000 who are paying for private insurance could qualify for Medicaid and switch providers, Senate Finance committee members were told. That raised questions about how other states have absorbed such a large number of patients, and the effect it will have on primary care.\n\n\"That is a concern of mine,\" Reynolds said, explaining that some doctors could be discouraged from seeing Medicaid patients because the rates for Medicaid are lower than Medicare. \"We need to look at and see if there's a way to maximize the funding under this program to incentivize providers to provide care.\"\n\nLegislators also expressed interest in getting more information about how other states have customized their Medicaid programs. Arkansas, Indiana, Iowa, Michigan, Montana and New Hampshire have all obtained approval from the Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services to alter their plans in some way.\n\nResponding to a question from Sen. Eric LaFleur, D-Ville Platte, about ways to encourage people to buy private insurance -- something other states have done using Medicaid waivers -- Reynolds said that Medicaid expansion could be an opportunity to \"revamp\" the state's health care model as a whole.\n\n\"I think everything's on the table,\" Reynolds said. \"This in my mind is a chance to look at the entire system, see what makes sense, if it makes sense to put this new eligibility group -- other states have done that. I think we need to look at the legacy system and the new expansion system\" with an eye toward improving patient outcomes.\n\n\"Do you think we can do that in less than a year?\" LeFleur asked, referencing the time needed to seek federally approved waivers to customize the Medicaid program.\n\n\"It's on the top of my transition list,\" Reynolds said.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Medicaid, Louisiana, Senate Finance Committee, John Bel Edwards, Department of Health and Hospitals, br-homepage, br-politics, health care, homepage, john bel edwards, louisiana legislature, medicaid expansion, news, politics", "title": "State Senate Finance committee asks for report on Medicaid expansion", "og": {"site_name": "NOLA.com", "description": "Senate Finance Committee members asked the Department of Health and Hospitals on Monday (Dec. 7) to produce a report outlining Louisiana's options for expanding Medicaid, to be delivered by Jan. 1.
