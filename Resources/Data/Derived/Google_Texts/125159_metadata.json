Academic counsellors have told prospective students for years that they\u2019re a safe bet and that just about anyone with a nursing degree can land a decent (if not great) paying career. In fact, nursing jobs are one of the few careers expected to show continued growth as the baby boomer generation finishes its mad dash towards retirement. That said, there are many changes coming to nursing jobs, and many new nurses are finding it harder to find employment than they had expected.\n\nAccording to a report on Las Vegas CBS affiliate KLAS-TV that delves into the area\u2019s nursing shortage, however, most of the job openings for nurses \u2014 at least in the Las Vegas area \u2014 are for experienced nurses. Much of the rest of the country mirrors the situation in Nevada. New nurses need not apply. There are simply more nursing school graduates than there are entry level nursing jobs. The report puts a positive spin on the situation, with the Dean of the UNLV nursing school saying:\n\n\u201cOur students don\u2019t generally have a problem getting jobs, but they can\u2019t get any job they want. I can\u2019t say there\u2019s a nursing shortage right now. I think we have a sufficient number of nurses. What we don\u2019t have is a sufficient number of experienced nurses.\u201d\n\nShe goes on to explain that there will likely be a lot more nursing jobs available as more people benefit from the Affordable Care Act, as obesity problems in the United States increase and as our population continues to age. Many of these jobs, however, are likely to be in retirement communities, extended care facilities and other non-hospital settings.\n\nThis presents a bit of a problem for nursing students, many of whom invested a good deal in their college education hoping to land nursing jobs in the hospitals, which traditionally pay considerably more than nursing homes, private medical practices and other available nursing jobs.\n\nThe shortage of nursing jobs available to new graduates comes on top of the bottleneck many nursing students experience when trying to pursue their education in public universities. Most state universities and community colleges typically have many more students than openings. The problem is especially acute when nursing students are trying to get into clinicals \u2014 an important requirement before graduating and entering the work force in any nursing job.\n\nThis article in Medscape gives a more detailed analysis of the nursing job prospects \u2014 or lack or prospects \u2014 that recent nursing graduates face. It goes so far as to suggest use the term \u201cthe big lie\u201d to refer to the idea that nursing grads can to find nursing jobs waiting for them.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Nursing jobs.
