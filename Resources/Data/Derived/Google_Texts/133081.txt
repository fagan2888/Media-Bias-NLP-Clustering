Two-time World Arm wrestling League champion Devon Larratt may be the best in the game, but what happens when you put him up against Game of Thrones’s beast of a man, “The Mountain?” Well, it turns out “The Mountain” loses. That’s right; Europe’s strongest man, coming in at 6-foot-9 and 400 pounds lost to Devon Larratt, 6-foot-5 and 225 pounds.

But how is this possible? It all boils down to simple technique. When arm wrestling an opponent, the key to winning is to optimize your positioning to activate the strongest muscles in your arm and upper body. You also want to get the advantage from the moment the ref tells you to go. There are two ways you can do this.

The Hook technique utilizes the main muscles involved in wrist flexion, flexing the arm at the elbow, and medial rotation. Instead of focusing on your biceps, which can lock your arm at the elbow, the hook will create “side pressure” that will easily pin your partner down. The medial rotation muscles are both the biggest and strongest in your upper body. In order to activate them, place your shoulder slightly in front of your body and raise it upward toward your ear. Squeeze your arm forward to get your chest muscles going. Then, when you start the round, force your opponent's hand back to make it easier to twist your wrist toward you. Finally, pin him.

The second, which is Larratt’s own technique is the Top Roll. The same muscles are used as with the Hook, but with the addition of the Extensor Carpi radialis, and Pronator Teres to help extend your wrist. To do this, pull your arm toward your chin with your biceps. Then, unlock your opponent’s fingers so that you can move your hand upward in your opponent’s palm. When your hand is at the top of theirs, you pull your hand toward you to gain leverage, and boom, you’re the winner.
