Zenefits, a human resources (HR) automation software company, is now offering ACA Compliance Automation to its benefits customers to help them comply with the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act’s (ACA) new coverage and reporting requirements.

Zenefits brings benefits data, payroll data, and employee data together, then generates and automatically files completed 1094-C and 1095-C forms with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The company helps employers understand how to measure hourly employees and offer insurance in a compliant way.

Zenefits says it has done the hard work of figuring out the IRS transition reliefs and IRS form codes for the employer. In addition, Zenefits’ ACA Compliance Automation is free.

The product will be rolled out to benefits customers this fall, giving them the ability to meet deadlines that come as early as February 1, 2016, the company says. More information about Zenefits is at www.zenefits.com
