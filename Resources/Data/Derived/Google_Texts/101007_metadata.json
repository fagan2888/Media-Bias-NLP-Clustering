I would expect our medical needs would go up as we get older.\"\n\nThen there is Allesandrina Pecchia of Dongan Hills, who runs a telecommunications contracting company with her husband that employs eight people.\n\nShe said they received a letter from their health insurer \"informing us that because of Obamacare, they will be dropping small businesses.\"\n\nNot only that, but Ms. Pecchia said the group-coverage plan they selected was deemed \"sub-standard,\" which she said it was not.\n\nBottom line, said Ms. Pecchia: \"Our (insurance) agent said our cost will go up 40 percent.\"\n\n\"We wanted to grow our business,\" she said. \"We can't. The raises we wanted to give won't be as big because our operating costs will be higher.\"\n\nAdded Ms. Pecchia: \"The president says you will have a lot of options for health plans, but you don't. The exchanges don't give you options to medications; they are mostly generic. The insurance companies are dictating your doctor, your medicine, your care.\"\n\nSaglibene and Ms. Pecchia are among the Staten Islanders who contacted Rep. Michael Grimm about how the health care law is affecting them.\n\nGrimm, as part of a GOP share-your-story outreach, video tapped a message calling for reaction and input from constituents.\n\nIn it, he notes that some 3.5 million Americans have been issued cancellation notices, in part for policies considered sub-par.\n\nWhile Grimm told the Advance that the Affordable Care Act is \"systematically broken and flawed in its premise,\" he added, \"There is not much I can do.\"\n\nHe said passing additional bills in the House to knock down Obamacare that won't pass the Senate wouldn't be fruitful. He said the way to achieve a change in the law is by electing people to Congress who want to undo it.\n\nStill, Grimm said there are \"good\" aspects of the plan, including coverage of pre-existing conditions and the ability to insure children under a parent's policy until they reach the age of 26.\n\nMeanwhile, said Saglibene, recalling his long IT background: \"Did they stress test it enough to meet the capacity of all the people signing up? I guess not. Did they do disaster recovery tests? This is bigger than they thought.\"\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "michael-grimm, news", "title": "Added costs for Obamacare put squeeze on Staten Islanders; Grimm seeks input (with video)", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Added costs for Obamacare put squeeze on Staten Islanders; Grimm seeks input (with video)\", \"link\": \"http://www.silive.com/news/index.ssf/2013/11/staten_islanders_face_obamacar.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://imgick.silive.com/home/silive-media/width620/img/latest_news/photo/13836503-standard.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"11690656\", \"pub_date\": \"2013-11-25T10:52:59Z\", \"author\": \"Judy L.
