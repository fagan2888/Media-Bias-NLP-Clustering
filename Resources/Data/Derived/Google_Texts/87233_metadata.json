Passenger numbers are on target to break that former record, largely driven by the dramatic growth of budget carrier Allegiant Airline during his tenure.\n\nLocal officials and business leaders credit him with helping bring a wave of leisure travel to the area with more than 50 cities in the United States and Canada having direct flights to Pinellas and its beaches on Allegiant and a handful of other low-cost carriers.\n\nThe airport known as PIE also has undergone a thorough overhaul of its dated, 1970s-style terminal that will continue after Lagos is gone.\n\nHe has overseen tens of millions of dollars in improvements done incrementally with grant money and a modest budget that has helped the facility maintain its reputation for having the lowest carrier fees in the state.\n\n\u201cThe industry has realized that PIE is a viable commercial service airport serving the Tampa Bay community,\u201d says Lagos, 64.\n\n\u201cThere is a place in the market for international, low-cost carriers to continue to grow this airport. That\u2019s a longer term vision.\u201d\n\nLong-time deputy director Tom Jewsbury will take over for Lagos, who retires May 15. Jewsbury is poised to guide the airport into a future where county officials may contemplate building new runways to keep up with growth in service rather than struggle to fill gaps left by bankrupted airlines.\n\nThe 20-year airport employee formerly in charge of operations ranging from security to information technology will lead an upcoming public discussion about the county-owned facility\u2019s future in a master plan process scheduled to begin in 2017.\n\n\u2756 \u2756 \u2756\n\nThe current airfield takes up about half of the 2,000 acres controlled by the airport along Old Tampa Bay. Local leaders will take a serious look at PIE\u2019s potential to expand, possibly starting with a 120-acre former golf course at the south side of the property.\n\n\u201cIf we want to continue in this direction and provide Allegiant the opportunity to grow as it wants to and also provide the opportunity for other airlines to come to the airport, there\u2019s going to have to be a significant expansion of the airport,\u201d said Jewsbury, 47, who came to the airport in 1994.\n\nIn the meantime, a series of upgrades are underway that include new flight display systems, concessions, more concourse seating and the upcoming construction of 500 additional remote parking spaces, a multimillion-dollar undertaking made possible by several years of substantial passenger growth.\n\n\u201cYears ago, we would not have been able to afford to do that,\u201d Lagos said.\n\n\u201cOur philosophy is pay as you go.\u201d\n\nWhen Lagos arrived in 2004, he quickly learned he had inherited a \u201chandyman special\u201d badly in need of an updating in both infrastructure and aesthetics \u2014 especially its dreary battleship-grey color scheme, he said.\n\n\u201cThe facility hadn\u2019t been updated except for new baggage claim since 2000,\u201d he said.\n\nA precipitous drop in air service no one saw coming initially put such improvements out of reach financially, but Lagos quickly began looking for outside sources to fill the gap.\n\nThe airport has taken on a $22 million terminal renovation with expanded gates, new jet bridges and replacement of the facility\u2019s air chiller system \u2014 using only 10 percent of its own budget while relying on state and federal grants for the remainder.\n\n\u201cWe keep proactively growing, but we have to do it in phases because we don\u2019t have the money to do it all at once,\u201d Lagos said.\n\n\u201cIt helps keep our costs low to the airlines to move forward in a phased approach.\u201d\n\n\u2756 \u2756 \u2756\n\nThe airport never will reach the scale of its much larger neighbor across the bay, Tampa International Airport, but Jewsbury hopes to continue driving growth by sustaining PIE\u2019s low-cost carriers.\n\nDuring the past year, Allegiant has brought new flights to Clearwater every couple of months \u2014 in February, the carrier announced service to Akron, Ohio, and Raleigh, North Carolina, bringing its total flights to 43 \u2014 and currently it provides more than 90 percent of the airport\u2019s passenger traffic.\n\nLargely thanks to Allegiant, the airport in July is set to handle 125 to 130 flights per week throughout the month \u2014 more than its historically busiest time of year, the December holiday season \u2014 and should top 1.6 million passengers for the entire year.\n\nJewsbury is keenly aware that a big part of his job going forward will be to build on this success by luring new carriers.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re very fortunate that Allegiant is a very financially sound airline and continuing to grow, but it makes us very vulnerable should something happen to Allegiant,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cSo that is a priority; to go out there to look at new airlines that have an interest in coming to this airport,\u201d noting the new Silver Airways flights to Key West and Fort Lauderdale scheduled to start in May.\n\nIn retirement, Lagos plans to head down to the Florida Keys himself this summer, in a motor home, and also expects to spend more time boating and bicycling, with an occasional vacation flight.\n\nHe said he is proud of being a \u201ccatalyst for change\u201d at the airport but gives much of the credit to staffers such as Jewsbury and others who have helped establish a foundation for its future.\n\n\u201cI feel a great sense of accomplishment in leaving the legacy that will set the stage for the future growth of this airport,\u201d he said.\n\njboatwright@tampatrib.com\n\n(727) 215-1277\n\nTwitter: @JBoatwrightTBO", "article_metadata": {"taboola-pub-time": "Sat, 14 Mar 2015 12:24:18 -0400", "Description": "Lagos says he inherited a handyman special when he came to St. Petersburg-Clearwater International Airport in 2004.
