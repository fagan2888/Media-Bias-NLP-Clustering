Aldrich needed donated human breast milk before Edmunds could produce enough of her own milk to feed him. MUSC can now access donated breast milk from the Mother\u2019s Milk Bank of South Carolina.\n\nSouth Carolina\u2019s first breast milk bank opened in North Charleston last week with a 34-liter donation \u2014 two coolers full \u2014 of frozen milk from an anonymous Georgetown mom.\n\nFor more information For more information about the Mother\u2019s Milk Bank of South Carolina or to find out how you can become a breast milk donor, go to www.scmilkbank.org.\n\nWhile online breast milk transactions have become increasingly popular between moms who produce too much milk and moms who can\u2019t produce enough, breast milk at this new milk bank won\u2019t be sold to the general public. Instead, donated milk will be pasteurized on site, analyzed for nutrients, tested for safety at the Medical University of South Carolina and then distributed to neonatal intensive care units across the state that serve some of South Carolina\u2019s smallest, sickest newborns.\n\nInfant mortality in South Carolina Babies die before their first birthday in South Carolina, particularly in rural parts of the state, at much higher rates than infants in other states. The Post and Courier spent five months investigating the problem. Read the full \u201cCradle of Shame\u201d report online at www.postandcourier.com/infant-mortality\n\n\u201cWe want to encourage as many women as possible to breast feed,\u201d said Beth De Santis, the state health department\u2019s director for maternal and child health. \u201cBreast-feeding helps people stay healthy.\u201d\n\nThe benefits of breast milk are well documented. It boosts a newborn infant\u2019s immune system, provides a low-cost source of nutrition and even helps some moms lose weight after delivery.\n\nBut it is particularly important for premature babies who will more likely die from a relatively rare disease called necrotizing entercolitis if they\u2019re fed instant formula. The disease, which destroys a baby\u2019s intestines, killed more than 150 infants in South Carolina in the past 20 years. In 2013, necrotizing entercolitis was a top 10 cause of infant mortality in this state.\n\nBreast milk offers an easy way to prevent the disease, but the milk isn\u2019t cheap and most premature babies in neonatal intensive care, while tiny, still need about 8 ounces a day. Some moms can\u2019t pump that much.\n\nFor many years, MUSC has purchased breast milk for $5 an ounce from a nonprofit milk bank in Texas. Other hospitals have paid even more for milk from for-profit distributors. The new nonprofit Mother\u2019s Milk Bank of South Carolina will charge $4 an ounce.\n\nThe donated milk in North Charleston will be sold and shipped to high-level hospital nurseries across the state. For now, it will be fed only to premature babies in hospitals who have been born very early and weigh less than 3 pounds, 3 ounces.\n\nThe price per ounce that the Mother\u2019s Milk Bank of South Carolina will charge covers the cost to process donations and send the pasteurized milk to hospitals through FedEx. The milk bank will probably break even. Any profit will be used to expand the operation or to decrease the per-ounce price.\n\n\u201cI have learned more than I ever thought I would about starting a small business,\u201d said Dr. Sarah Taylor, an MUSC neonatologist. She turned the milk bank into reality after the idea was first introduced at a 2013 South Carolina Neonatal Medical Consortium meeting.\n\n\u201cSomeone said we need a milk bank,\u201d Taylor said at the grand opening Thursday. \u201cWe all agreed. Then, it was like, \u2018Whoa. How are we going to do this?\u2019 \u201d\n\nFirst, she needed to find about $200,000 to pay for a space and the expensive equipment. Taylor turned to the state Medicaid agency and its South Carolina Birth Outcomes Initiative for help, but the agency was initially reluctant to fund the project.\n\nMedicaid, which pays for more than half of all births in South Carolina every year, eventually donated $50,000 to the milk bank. Nurses at Tidelands Health in Georgetown County, the South Carolina BlueCross BlueShield Foundation, the South Carolina Perinatal Association and other groups also contributed.\n\nNow that the milk bank is up and running, donated milk is more important than money, Taylor said. \u201cIf we don\u2019t have milk, we don\u2019t have a bank.\u201d\n\nTen \u201cmilk depots\u201d have been set up across the state so that women can donate their excess breast milk. Some moms produce more milk than their healthy babies need.\n\nWomen must be screened and cleared for donation before their milk is accepted. They will not be compensated for their donations, but Taylor said the pay-off is immeasurable.\n\n\u201cAs a neonatologist, I see the importance of this milk every day in the unit and how it helps these babies.\u201d\n\nReach Lauren Sausser at 937-5598.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "South Carolina\u2019s first breast milk bank opens in North Charleston, FP LatestNews, \r\nFP LatestNewsHealth care, \r\nMetro, \r\nMetro, breast milk,Infant mortality,Medicaid,MUSC", "og": {"site_name": "Post and Courier", "description": "South Carolina\u2019s first breast milk bank opened in North Charleston last week with a 34-liter donation \u2014 two coolers full \u2014 of frozen milk from an anonymous Georgetown mom.", "title": "South Carolina\u2019s first breast milk bank opens in North Charleston", "url": "http://www.postandcourier.com20150503/150509892/south-carolina-x2019-s-first-breast-milk-bank-opens-in-north-charleston", "image": {"url": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20150503/PC16/150509892/AR/0/AR-150509892.jpg", "identifier": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20150503/PC16/150509892/AR/0/AR-150509892.jpg"}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "South Carolina\u2019s first breast milk bank opened in North Charleston last week with a 34-liter donation \u2014 two coolers full \u2014 of frozen milk from an anonymous Georgetown mom.", "title": "South Carolina\u2019s first breast milk bank opens in North Charleston", "app": {"country": "US", "name": {"ipad": "Post and Courier", "iphone": "Post and Courier", "googleplay": "Post and Courier"}, "id": {"ipad": 603721271, "iphone": 603721271, "googleplay": "com.Synapse.PandC"}}, "site": "@postandcourier", "image": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20150503/PC16/150509892/AR/0/AR-150509892.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msvalidate.01": "05BAEC9D8820FA9F10D57DB6EB3C6192", "metered": "yes", "p": {"domain_verify": "c6511264bdb6fa45c6bb985fb86d3ab2"}, "fb": {"app_id": 146078808769941}, "tout": {"article": {"id": 150509892}}, "google-site-verification": "rAW9DX7yfiFF82k05QGF6LbZBkxcKxMTzAwNv0OCKAM", "keywords": "South Carolina\u2019s first breast milk bank opens in North Charleston , FP LatestNews, \r\nFP LatestNewsHealth care, \r\nMetro, \r\nMetro, breast milk,Infant mortality,Medicaid,MUSC", "article": {"published_time": "2015-05-03T22:00:00Z", "modified_time": "2015-05-03T19:38:00Z", "author": "Lauren Sausser"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "description": "South Carolina\u2019s first breast milk bank opened in North Charleston last week with a 34-liter donation \u2014 two coolers full \u2014 of frozen milk from an anonymous Georgetown mom."}, "article_summary": "South Carolina\u2019s first breast milk bank opened in North Charleston last week with a 34-liter donation \u2014 two coolers full \u2014 of frozen milk from an anonymous Georgetown mom.\nWhile online breast milk transactions have become increasingly popular between moms who produce too much milk and moms who can\u2019t produce enough, breast milk at this new milk bank won\u2019t be sold to the general public.\nNurses at Tidelands Health in Georgetown County, the South Carolina BlueCross BlueShield Foundation, the South Carolina Perinatal Association and other groups also contributed.\nMUSC can now access donated breast milk from the Mother\u2019s Milk Bank of South Carolina.\nFor many years, MUSC has purchased breast milk for $5 an ounce from a nonprofit milk bank in Texas."}
