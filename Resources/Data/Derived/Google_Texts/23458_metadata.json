He loved the work but couldn\u2019t get any, so he joined the vast army of construction workers rendered jobless by the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression.\n\n\u201cI thought about going back to school,\u201d said Martin, taking a break from work at the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s newest dormitory.\n\nUp on the scaffolding, Rocco D\u2019Angelico, 59, said he managed to keep working as a bricklayer during the recession, but now he\u2019s looking toward retirement because of \u201call the aches and pains in my bones.\u201d\n\nTogether, D\u2019Angelico and Martin represent the two forces \u2014 recession and retirement \u2014 that explain why construction jobs are among the occupations projected to grow the most and the fastest in the next decade.\n\nEvery two years, the Labor Department\u2019s Bureau of Labor Statistics issues a report on the nation\u2019s fastest-growing occupations, with the latest projecting job growth to 2022. The next, projecting jobs to 2024, is expected in December.\n\nNationally, laborers and carpenters are expected to add 478,000 jobs by 2022, the BLS projected.\n\nOn any building site, carpenters and laborers are the two categories of workers most needed, so it\u2019s no surprise that they would be the most needed in the future.\n\nOn a percentage basis, however, some of the specialty trades, such as the work done by bricklayers D\u2019Angelico and Martin, are projected to see the fastest growth.\n\nBrick- and stone-laying occupations are expected to grow by 35 percent, with 25,200 needed by 2022. Other fast-growing jobs in the building trades are insulation workers, brick-mason helpers and pavement layers.\n\n\u201cWe have 120 apprentices starting in September,\u201d said Dennis Pagliotti, president of Local 1 of the Bricklayers and Allied Craftworkers union in Philadelphia. \u201cWe\u2019re at full employment.\u201d\n\nWith more recruiters coming each year, every senior enrolled in the Williamson College of the Trades\u2019 carpentry and masonry programs in suburban Philly had at least one job offer by their May graduation, said Michelle Martella, the school\u2019s development officer.\n\nEconomist Bernard Markstein of Markstein Advisors tracks construction employment for the nonunion contractors\u2019 national association, Associated Builders and Contractors Inc.\n\n\u201cA lot of people exited the construction industry\u201d during the recession, Markstein said. \u201cWhen the housing bubble was popped, you were laid off \u2014 it wasn\u2019t a few months, it was several years.\n\n\u201cSome [workers] moved and went to the energy industry. Some were able to get related jobs in manufacturing,\u201d he said. \u201cSome of them took the huge proverbial pay cut. Some older workers retired.\n\n\u201cAs construction is coming back, the retired people are five years older. They aren\u2019t going to re-enter. Some who got stable work [in other fields] aren\u2019t willing to give it up,\u201d Markstein said.\n\nDuring the recession, he said, contractors kept their best employees but didn\u2019t build a pipeline.\n\n\u201cThey have gone five years without training new people [while also] losing the trained people,\u201d he said. \u201cThe result is \u2026 there is a shortage of skilled labor.\u201d\n\nAn \u201coverwhelming majority\u201d of contractors surveyed in December by the union group, the Association of General Contractors, said they planned to expand their payrolls in 2015 and 2016.\n\nAverage weekly hours for construction workers rose to 39.9 hours in June, the highest weekly June rate since the statistic was first tracked in 1947, the group reported. Unemployment in the trades fell to its lowest level since 2001.\n\nJane M.
