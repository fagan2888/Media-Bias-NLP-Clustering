An investigation by The Post published in August, however, found there were other factors, including a 2011 agreement between the agency and its contractor making the VA responsible for a design that could be built for $604 million.\n\nThe project cost has soared to $1.67 billion, and the hospital is not expected to open for at least two more years.\n\nIn theory, the IDC contracting method is used to select a contractor early in the design phase to help review costs. But in Aurora, the VA hired its design team years before selecting Kiewit-Turner as the general contractor.\n\nHospital construction restarted soon after Kiewit-Turner won a contract breach case and shut down the site. But the project has survived ever since on short-term gulps of capital from a disgruntled Congress.\n\nThe clock is ticking again.\n\nCongress provided enough money to get the hospital project through this fiscal year, which ends this month. But construction has been limping along with half the needed workers while the VA seeks $625 million to finish the job.\n\nWith 700 workers on site, \u201cevery day on the project, we give up a day\u201d toward the completion date, Gibson said.\n\nHe said he is not worried about another shutdown, however, and had encouraging talks with leaders of congressional veterans\u2019 committees.\n\nThe VA is proposing a completion plan that would not affect health services to veterans or existing projects, he said, and hoping that money specifically assigned to the Aurora VA hospital will be part of a continuing budget resolution in Congress.\n\n\u201cI think Congress understands the need to finish the project,\u201d he said.\n\nIn its report, the Corps found that the VA\u2019s choice of an IDC contract in Aurora was \u201ccompounded by an apparent lack of understanding of its complexities.\u201d\n\nIts report, dated June 8 but released Thursday, cited three other factors that helped push up the cost of the most expensive construction project in VA history:\n\n\u2022 The project should not have been controlled 2,000 miles away in Washington, D.C. \u201cThe lack of delegated authority to the on-site project executive,\u201d the Corps said, to manage all the moving parts of a giant undertaking \u201chas proven adverse in the extreme to this project.\u201d\n\n\u2022 The project lacked discipline. \u201cBoth internal and external pressures continually shifting course on scope, size, etc., with little regard to schedule and cost shifts, have dramatically impacted project completion.\u201d\n\n\u2022 The project lacked an adequate staff. Those shortages \u201cproved challenging to the extreme,\u201d the report said, \u201cin consideration of its vast size and major changes in scope across its timeline.\u201d\n\nGibson said the VA embraces those findings and is working closely with Kiewit-Turner now. He challenged subcontractors to return to the hospital site once money is secured to complete construction.\n\n\u201cWhat veterans need,\u201d he said, \u201cis for the subcontracting community to step up.\u201d\n\nDavid Olinger: 303-954-1498, dolinger@denverpost.com or twitter.com/dolingerdp", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Army Corps of Engineers report traces Aurora VA debacle to contract", "title": "Army Corps of Engineers report traces Aurora VA debacle to contract", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/09/03/army-corps-of-engineers-report-traces-aurora-va-debacle-to-contract/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150903__va_hospital_aerialp1-1.jpg", "height": 431}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150903__va_hospital_aerialp1-1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-09-03T17:24:31+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-22T02:41:40+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Aurora VA hospital"}, "article_summary": "Congress provided enough money to get the hospital project through this fiscal year, which ends this month.\nHospital construction restarted soon after Kiewit-Turner won a contract breach case and shut down the site.\nHe challenged subcontractors to return to the hospital site once money is secured to complete construction.\nThe report cited the \u201cmyriad challenges\u201d the Aurora VA hospital faced, from changing plans and designs to chaotic management and long delays in processing requests for change orders, which led to construction delays.\nBut in Aurora, the VA hired its design team years before selecting Kiewit-Turner as the general contractor."}
