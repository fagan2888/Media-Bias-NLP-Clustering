They contend state control could save money by slashing administrative costs for private insurance providers and buying pharmaceuticals at bulk prices.\n\nOther countries have government-run health care systems, but neither the United States nor any individual states have followed that approach.\n\nIn Denver, chamber of commerce president Kelly Brough said Colorado should not risk becoming the first state.\n\n\u201cRegardless of where you live in our state, regardless of your party affiliation and even regardless of whether or not you philosophically believe in a national single payer health care system \u2014 we can all agree that this proposal is bad for Colorado,\u201d she said.\n\nStapleton said the health care proposal \u201cwould literally double the state budget\u201d and impose a new tax on working families.\n\nRitter said the budget \u201cis already burdened with too many constitutional measures \u2014 let alone one of this cost and magnitude.\u201d\n\nThe opposition group, Coloradans for Coloradans, describes itself as backed by state business, civic and community leaders and state and local elected officials.\n\nDavid Olinger: 303-954-1498, dolinger@denverpost.com or @dolingerdp", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Colorado leaders launch campaign against single-payer health proposal", "title": "Colorado leaders launch campaign against single-payer health proposal", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/01/27/colorado-leaders-launch-campaign-against-single-payer-health-proposal/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "height": 630}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2016-01-27T15:52:35+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-01-27T15:52:35+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Obamacare"}, "article_summary": "The campaign to defeat a proposal for a single-payer health insurance system in Colorado is kicking off Thursday with some high-profile leaders.\nStapleton said the health care proposal \u201cwould literally double the state budget\u201d and impose a new tax on working families.\nIn a news release, opponents call the initiative \u201ca risky and untested state-run health insurance system\u201d that would raise taxes by $25 billion in its first year.\nAdvocates propose a 10 percent payroll tax, with two-thirds of the money coming from employers and one-third from employees, to finance a Colorado health care system.\nOther countries have government-run health care systems, but neither the United States nor any individual states have followed that approach."}
