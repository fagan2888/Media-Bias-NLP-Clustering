House Speaker John Boehner went to the press to declare: \u201cThis isn\u2019t some damn game\u2026The American people don\u2019t want their government shut down and neither do I. All we\u2019re asking for is to sit down and have a discussion and to bring fairness\u2014reopen the government and bring fairness to the American people under Obamacare. It\u2019s as simple as that. But it all has to begin with a simple discussion.\u201d\n\nBoehner\u2019s request is nonsense. The continuing resolution isn\u2019t the place for broad budget negotiations. Republicans don\u2019t get goodies for allowing the government to run, as if it\u2019s some kind of concession. Likewise, they aren\u2019t privileged in their preferences for the Affordable Care Act. If the GOP wants to repeal or defund the law, it should build support, win elections, and pursue its goals through normal means. To do otherwise, to force legislative concessions through manufactured crisis, is to destabilize our system and damage the foundation of our democracy.\n\n\"Parks & Rec,\" \"Veep,\" and \"The West Wing\" take on the government shutdown. #winning\n\nAll of that is also true of the debt ceiling. Lifting the government\u2019s borrowing authority isn\u2019t a \u201cwin\u201d for Obama, it\u2019s a necessary step\u2014the only way the White House can follow the law and pay for spending authorized by Congress.\n\nIf Boehner wants to negotiate, he needs to stand down and end the shutdown. It\u2019s what the country wants, it\u2019s what the Democratic Party wants, and it\u2019s what a growing number of Republicans want.\n\nBut the congressional GOP is boxed in by its own rhetoric. It started this fight from a false premise\u2014that legislative hostage taking is a routine part of lawmaking\u2014and is still committed to the idea. \u201cI don\u2019t see any way he would get a debt ceiling passed in the House without some conditions,\u201d said Louisiana Rep. John Fleming, in response to the prospect of debt ceiling negotiations. Likewise, a Boehner spokesman, Michael Steel, told the Journal that the speaker \u201chas always said that the United States will not default on its debt\u2014but if we\u2019re going to raise the debt limit, we need to deal with the drivers of our debt and deficits.\u201d\n\nIn Season 3 of The Wire, as the remnants of Avon Barksdale\u2019s drug crew prepare for war against a rival gang, Barksdale lieutenant Slim Charles challenges the idea that they should back down or deescalate: \u201cFact is, we went to war, and now there ain\u2019t no going back. I mean, shit, it\u2019s what war is, you know? Once you in it, you in it. If it\u2019s a lie, then we fight on that lie.
