Never heard of him. Did you mean that short-lived but intensely funny SNL skit, \u201cMacGruber\u2019? She\u2019s heard of that. But Jooonaaaathaaaan Gruuuuuberrrr? Isn\u2019t ringing any bells.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) on Thursday tried to downplay comments by an architect of Obamacare, who was caught talking about the \u201cstupidity of the American voter,\u201d by saying she doesn\u2019t even know who he is. \u201cI don\u2019t know who he is,\u201d she told reporters. \u201cHe didn\u2019t help write our bill.\u201d\n\nWhich is hilarious since not only did her office repeatedly mention Gruber in a press release about the Affordable Care Act posted on her website (though it\u2019s now been taken down), but Pelosi herself dropped Gruber\u2019s name in an interview about the ACA back in November of 2009.\n\nPELOSI: Let me just say this. Anything you need to know about the difference between the Democratic bill and the Republican bill is that the Republicans do not end the health insurance companies\u2019 discrimination against people with preexisting conditions. They let that stand. That\u2019s scandalous, the fact that it exists. I don\u2019t understand why they have not heard the American people, who have said preexisting conditions should not be a source of discrimination. And secondly, the Republican plan ensures about 3 million more people than now, and ours does 36 million people. So that\u2019s a very big difference in that. We\u2019re not finished getting all of our reports back from CBO, but we\u2019ll have a side by side to compare. But our bill brings down rates. I don\u2019t know if you have seen Jonathan Gruber of MIT\u2019s analysis of what the comparison is to the status quo versus what will happen in our bill for those who seek insurance within the exchange. And our bill takes down those costs, even some now, and much less preventing the upward spiral.\n\nSeems like she also might be relying on the stupidity of the American voter.", "article_metadata": {"fb": {"pages": 1742097289343962}, "generator": "WordPress 4.4", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Nancy Pelosi has absolutely no idea who this Jonathan Gruber guy is.\nSeems like she also might be relying on the stupidity of the American voter.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know who he is,\u201d she told reporters.\nI don\u2019t understand why they have not heard the American people, who have said preexisting conditions should not be a source of discrimination.\nHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) on Thursday tried to downplay comments by an architect of Obamacare, who was caught talking about the \u201cstupidity of the American voter,\u201d by saying she doesn\u2019t even know who he is."}
