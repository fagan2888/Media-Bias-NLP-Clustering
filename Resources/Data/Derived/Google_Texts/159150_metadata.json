Secretary of Education Arne Duncan is not the first to use the General Waiver Authority in Section 9401 of NCLB, although as the graph below shows, the Obama administration has approved an unprecedented number of waivers since 2009.[2]\n\nFocusing solely on this recent increase in volume can mask a crucial pattern \u2013 over the last ten years, the Bush and Obama administrations both used waivers to address demands for change while avoiding a confrontation over renewal with Congress. While waivers allowed states to deviate from NCLB, strategic use of this tool has enabled delay in the renewal process.\n\nSource: U.S. Department of Education\n\nBeginning in 2005, the Bush administration faced increasing pressure to grant states relief from NCLB\u2019s onerous accountability requirements.[3] The administration might have been forced to revisit the law then if not for the safety valve provided by the General Waiver Authority in Section 9401. In a policy letter issued on November 21, 2005, then-Secretary of Education Margaret Spellings articulated a \u201ccommonsense approach\u201d to implementation, offering waivers from key provisions. This approach reversed her predecessor\u2019s position that waivers were not an option\u2014indeed, Spellings invited states to submit proposals for growth model pilots, providing states with an opportunity to depart from the accountability system mandated by NCLB.[4]\n\nThe Bush administration\u2019s strategic use of wavier authority allowed them to address the discontent that simmered among the states while simultaneously protecting their signature education law. A few months after the initial offer of flexibility, Secretary Spellings issued a reminder to Chief State School Officers that only states demonstrating adherence to the \u201cbright line principles\u201d of NCLB were eligible for flexibility. The administration had an obvious motivation to avoid legislative overhaul of NCLB: the law was a cornerstone of the President\u2019s domestic agenda. Even as ED granted states flexibility from the law, in his 2007 State of the Union address President Bush stood by NCLB, calling it a \u201cgood law\u201d and warning against \u201cbacksliding and calling it reform.\u201d\n\nIn stark contrast, President Obama had no stake in preserving NCLB. In the June 2009 Attitudes Toward the Public Schools Survey, 48 percent of respondents viewed the law unfavorably, while just 28 percent viewed it favorably. But his legislative proposal to reform NCLB, the Blueprint for Reform, was essentially dead on arrival \u2013 the Blueprint was announced on March 10, 2010, just weeks before the Affordable Care Act infamously passed without a single Republican vote.\n\nIn this political climate, the Obama administration opted for a waiver strategy in lieu of a public and potentially costly renewal via Congress. Over a year after introducing the Blueprint and making little headway in Congress, on September 23, 2011 the administration announced its Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) Flexibility waiver program. This strategy echoes the decision made by the Bush administration, although the specific political motivations and mechanisms of their waiver policies differ. The ESEA Flexibility waivers allowed the Obama administration to respond to increasing pressure to change the unpopular law but also helped them avoid another legislative battle in the immediate wake of the acrimonious ACA debates.\n\nWhile ESSA eliminates the Secretary\u2019s authority to attach conditions to waivers, rebuking the current administration\u2019s tactic, our understanding of the impact of waivers should not be limited to this backlash. One long-term consequence of the Bush and Obama administrations\u2019 strategic use of waivers has been a series of piecemeal changes to a law that many have long viewed as fundamentally broken in lieu of legislative renewal and the large-scale shifts that accompany reauthorization.\n\nHowever, placing blame for the delay in reauthorizing NCLB with either or both administrations\u2019 use of Section 9401 waiver authority is perhaps unwarranted. The extreme partisan polarization that characterizes this era shares the blame for the eight years of delay that preceded the current ESEA renewal. Indeed, in this climate when the feasibility of bipartisan compromise is often in doubt, it is hard to criticize administrations that opt for incremental revision at the state level where otherwise no measure of change appears possible.", "article_metadata": {"description": "In light of Wednesday's passage of a bipartisan rewrite of No Child Left Behind (NCLB) in the Senate, Elizabeth Mann explains the long-term impact of NCLB waivers on Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) renewal.", "title": "The long-term impact of NCLB waivers on ESEA renewal", "og": {"site_name": "The Brookings Institution", "description": "In light of Wednesday's passage of a bipartisan rewrite of No Child Left Behind (NCLB) in the Senate, Elizabeth Mann explains the long-term impact of NCLB waivers on Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) renewal.", "title": "The long-term impact of NCLB waivers on ESEA renewal", "url": "http://www.brookings.edu/blogs/brown-center-chalkboard/posts/2015/12/10-no-child-left-behind-nclb-waivers-esea-renewal-mann", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/research/images/b/bu%20bz/bush_nclb001/bush_nclb001_16x9.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "height": 360}, "locale": "en", "type": "website", "determiner": "auto"}, "twitter": {"account_id": 151106990, "title": "The long-term impact of NCLB waivers on ESEA renewal", "image": {"width": 560, "identifier": "http://www.brookings.edu//~/media/research/images/b/bu%20bz/bush_nclb001/bush_nclb001_16x9.jpg?w=560", "height": 315}, "site": {"identifier": "BrookingsInst", "id": 151106990}, "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "In light of Wednesday's passage of a bipartisan rewrite of No Child Left Behind (NCLB) in the Senate, Elizabeth Mann explains the long-term impact of NCLB waivers on Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) renewal."}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 137459917707}, "ces": {"broadcontenttype": "Commentary ; Blog Posts", "programs": "Governance Studies", "topics": "Education ; Politics and Elections ; U.S. Government ; No Child Left Behind ; U.S. Politics ; U.S. Congress", "topicsbroad": "Education ; Politics and Elections ; U.S. Government", "centers": "Brown Center on Education Policy", "authors": "Elizabeth Mann", "contentdate": "2015/12/10 07:30:00", "title": "The long-term impact of NCLB waivers on ESEA renewal", "researchactivities": "Brown Center on Education Policy ; Governance Studies", "topicsspecialized": "No Child Left Behind ; U.S. Politics ; U.S. Congress"}, "article": {"tag": "Education", "published_time": "2015-12-10", "modified_time": "2015-12-11"}}, "article_summary": "[1]But the impact of waivers on NCLB implementation and renewal reaches beyond these specific changes in the law.\nWhile waivers allowed states to deviate from NCLB, strategic use of this tool has enabled delay in the renewal process.\nHowever, placing blame for the delay in reauthorizing NCLB with either or both administrations\u2019 use of Section 9401 waiver authority is perhaps unwarranted.\nSource: U.S. Department of EducationBeginning in 2005, the Bush administration faced increasing pressure to grant states relief from NCLB\u2019s onerous accountability requirements.\nIn this political climate, the Obama administration opted for a waiver strategy in lieu of a public and potentially costly renewal via Congress."}
