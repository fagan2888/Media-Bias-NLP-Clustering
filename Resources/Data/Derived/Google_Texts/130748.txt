Obamacare is working, whether Republicans like Ted Cruz want to admit it or not. And 8.2 million people could lose their insurance coverage if Republicans finally succeed (after trying dozens of times) in repealing the health care law, which could result in an estimated 9,800 deaths annually.

There’s your real death panel. As Ted Cruz delivered his sermon announcing his candidacy for president from Liberty University this morning, he drew a rousing cheer from the audience when he said he’d repeal Obamacare. Never mind that the GOP plan by Hatch-Upton-Burr to replace Obamacare will drive millions to tears as they would no longer be able to afford coverage.

The Ted Cruzes of the world should restrain their glee until they understand what taking away Obamacare will mean to Americans.

57 percent of customers in the Obaamacare exchanges were previously uninsured. 24 to 27 million people would be uninsured over the next decade if it weren’t for Obamacare. Obamacare will cost 20 percent less than originally projected. Almost 30 million people have become insured under Obamacare. Medical bills are now easier to pay thanks to Obamacare.

Thanks to Obamacare, millions of people can no longer be denied health care because of preexisting conditions, and women can’t be charged more simply for being a woman. And for the first time since 2003, fewer adults are avoiding or delaying filling prescriptions or seeking medical care. They’re also no longer skipping preventative care like flu shots, blood work, and cancer screenings because of cost.

So Ted Cruz can preach all he wants to the right-wing extremists about the evils of Obamacare, but it’s made a positive difference in millions of American people’s lives. Instead of orchestrating the anti-Obamacare shut down of our government, costing taxpayers billions, he could be working to improve the law, bringing health and well-being to millions more.
