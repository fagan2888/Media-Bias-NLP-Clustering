Wearing a dark sweater and khaki trousers, he picked at his beard, looked at the potential jurors and looked at the judge.\n\nOver the next three days, about 1,200 people will be called to federal court to be considered as potential jurors. The first 200 were given initial instructions Monday by Judge George O\u2019Toole Jr. Twelve jurors and six alternates are to be selected.\n\nPHOTOS: Dzhokhar Tsarnaev manhunt photos: The amazing police pictures\n\nThe courthouse was under tight security Monday, with dozens of police officers inside and outside the building. One bombing victim, Karen Brassard, was outside the jury room waiting to observe jury selection. There were no Tsarnaev supporters outside the courthouse as there have been during pretrial hearings.\n\nThe jury will decide whether Tsarnaev planned and carried out the twin bombings that killed three people and injured more than 260 near the finish line of the race on April 15, 2013.\n\nIf they find him guilty, they also will decide whether he should be put to death. Survivors and first responders are among those expected to testify.\n\nPHOTOS: Jury selection to get underway in marathon attacks\n\nHeather Abbott, of Newport, Rhode Island, who lost her left leg below the knee in the attacks, said her biggest question may be an unanswerable one: \u201cWhy?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know whether I\u2019ll ever get any answer to that question, but I guess I want to understand what the thought process was,\u201d said Abbott, who plans to attend some of the proceedings. \u201cWhy he would want to do this to people \u2026 it\u2019s really hard to understand.\u201d\n\nThe trial, which likely will last several months, is perhaps the most scrutinized case of its kind since Timothy McVeigh was convicted and executed for the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing.\n\nTsarnaev\u2019s lawyers tried for months to get the trial moved, arguing the Boston jury pool was tainted because of the number of locals with connections to the race. They drew parallels to the McVeigh case, which was moved to Denver for similar reasons. But U.S. District Judge George O\u2019Toole Jr., who is presiding over the case, refused.\n\nJury selection is expected to be a lengthy process because of extensive media coverage and the thousands of runners, spectators and others in the area affected by the bombings. The process also could be slowed if potential jurors express objections to the death penalty.\n\nProsecutors say 21-year-old Dzhokhar and his brother, Tamerlan Tsarnaev - ethnic Chechens who had lived in the United States for about a decade - carried out the bombings as retaliation for U.S. actions in Muslim countries. Tamerlan, 26, died after a firefight with police several days after the bombings.\n\nThe defense is expected to argue that Dzhokhar had a difficult childhood and was heavily influenced by his elder brother, who authorities believe became radicalized in the last few years of his life, including during a six-month trip to Dagestan and Chechnya in 2012.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Potential jurors stared intently at Boston Marathon bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev as jury selection in his federal death penalty trial began Monday under tight security.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Potential jurors stared intently at Boston Marathon bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev as jury selection in his federal death penalty trial began Monday under tight security.", "title": "Dzhokhar Tsarnaev trial: Jury selection gets underway", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jan/5/jury-selection-to-get-underway-in-marathon-attacks/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/12/22/d088cda1950d9931680f6a706700bd8b.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/12/22/d088cda1950d9931680f6a706700bd8b.jpg", "description": "Potential jurors stared intently at Boston Marathon bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev as jury selection in his federal death penalty trial began Monday under tight security.", "card": "summary", "title": "Dzhokhar Tsarnaev trial: Jury selection gets underway"}, "Author": "Denise Lavoie", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Law Crime, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, Boston, George O Toole Jr"}, "article_summary": "BOSTON (AP) \u2014 Potential jurors stared intently at Boston Marathon bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev as jury selection in his federal death penalty trial began Monday under tight security.\nOne bombing victim, Karen Brassard, was outside the jury room waiting to observe jury selection.\nOver the next three days, about 1,200 people will be called to federal court to be considered as potential jurors.\nWearing a dark sweater and khaki trousers, he picked at his beard, looked at the potential jurors and looked at the judge.\nPHOTOS: Dzhokhar Tsarnaev manhunt photos: The amazing police picturesThe courthouse was under tight security Monday, with dozens of police officers inside and outside the building."}
