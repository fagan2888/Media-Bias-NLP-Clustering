Chargemaster Toolkit and Pharmacy Chargelink \u2013 which will provide \u201calternative channels to market\u201d.\n\n\n\nThe company said visible revenues to full-year 2016 are \u00a3114.4 million, up from $109.5 million at the 2013 year end to June 30.\n\n\n\nAIM-listed Craneware is proposing 5.7p interim dividend, which is up 10 per cent on the 5.2p interim dividend last year.\n\n\n\nCommenting on the first-half performance, Craneware co-founder and chief executive, Keith Neilson, said: \u201cCraneware remains at the forefront of providing solutions to US healthcare providers so they can achieve the revenue integrity required to support improved patient care and outcomes.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe have seen a continued increase in sales during the period, to progressively larger hospital groups.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe US Healthcare market seems to be settling as strategies are developing to support the need for change and deal with the uncertainties of the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\n\n\u201cWith a strong product suite, clear strategic direction and high levels of revenue visibility, we are confident of continued future growth.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Medical billing software developer reports \"incremental increase\" in US healthcare contract wins", "author": "Scott McCulloch", "og": {"site_name": "dailyrecord", "description": "Medical billing software developer reports \"incremental increase\" in US healthcare contract wins", "language": "en", "tags": "Edinburgh", "url": "http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/business/company-results-forecasts/medical-billing-software-developer-reports-3230784", "section": "Company Results & Forecasts", "title": "Craneware reports 7% hike in first-half profits Craneware reports 7% hike in first-half profits", "type": "article", "image": "http://i3.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article3230822.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/Keith-Neilson-CEO-CranewareJPG.jpg"}, "twitter": {"site": "@insidermag", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@s_mccullochB7"}, "robots": "noarchive", "p": {"domain_verify": "9c8f12695d0efdcacf988dc19a32352d"}, "fb": {"page_id": 187523381277554, "app_id": 365562850134053, "pages": 187523381277554}, "article": {"published_time": "2014-03-11T16:12:48Z", "section": "Company Results & Forecasts", "modified_time": "2014-03-20T09:27:40Z", "tag": "Edinburgh", "expiration_time": "2014-04-19T10:27:40+01:00", "id": "111-86908-24058930"}, "google-site-verification": "Oo_2FIsctRQOPw8lggY__-TeYhXfBuRVjhXcA6ccb-c", "viewport": "width = 1300", "news_keywords": "Craneware reports 7% hike in first-half profits,Edinburgh"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8df6\"", "article_summary": "Medical billing software developer Craneware has reported strong first-half revenue and profit growth on the back of new contract wins in the US healthcare market.\n\u201cThe US Healthcare market seems to be settling as strategies are developing to support the need for change and deal with the uncertainties of the Affordable Care Act.\nThe US continues to be a \u201cgrowing market\u201d with 40 million more people in the US joining healthcare through the Affordable Healthcare Act.\nThe Edinburgh-headquartered company, which develops and sells billing and audit software to US healthcare companies, said first-half revenues are up five per cent to $21.1 million (\u00a312.7 million) and pre-tax profits rose six per cent to $4.79 million (\u00a32.9 million).\n\u201cWith a strong product suite, clear strategic direction and high levels of revenue visibility, we are confident of continued future growth.\u201d"}
