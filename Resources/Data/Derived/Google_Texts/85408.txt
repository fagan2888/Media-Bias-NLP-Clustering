Moments after Common and John Legend gave a moving performance of “Glory,” the original song written for the film “Selma,” the two won an Academy Award for “Best Original Song.”

Their speech was intensely impactful: It touched on the Voting Rights Act, protests in Hong Kong, the mass incarceration of black me in the United States and of course the iconic bridge in Selma.

“We say that Selma is now, because the struggle for justice is right now,” Legend said.

“We know that the Voting Rights Act that they fought for 50 years ago is being compromised right now in this country today,” he continued. “We know that right now, the struggle for freedom and justice is real. We live in the most incarcerated country in the world. There are more black men under correctional control today then were under slavery in 1850.”
