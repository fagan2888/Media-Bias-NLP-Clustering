The Metropolitan Opera’s singers, dancers and stage managers would lose between 22% and 39% of their compensation if the company’s proposed work-rule changes are implemented, according to a preliminary analysis by their union.

In a bid to reduce labor costs, the Met has proposed several work-rule changes and a high-deductible health insurance plan for its chorus, dancers and production staff. The Met hasn’t specify the net effect of those proposed changes on employees’ incomes.

In a letter to members Thursday, union head Alan Gordon called the Met’s proposals “an attack on its performing artists,” and advised members to prepare for a potential lockout.

Met spokesman Peter Clark said: “Mr. Gordon’s letter is inaccurate in every respect, and most significantly in his characterization of the Met’s proposal.”

The Met is also seeking concessions from its orchestra members and stagehands. An orchestra union spokesman Thursday said his group was still calculating how much the Met’s proposals would cut musicians’ pay.
