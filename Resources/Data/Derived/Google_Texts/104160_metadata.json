Photo Courtesy of Generation Floorball\n\nLoss of estrogen during menopause may raise a woman\u2019s risk of heart disease, but this increase may be offset with team activities and sports like floorball, a new study from the University of Copenhagen finds.\n\nPostdoctoral fellow and lead author Michael Nyberg told reporters that the findings build on previous research on postmenopausal health risks. \"Results demonstrate that blood pressure among postmenopausal women is 10 percent higher immediately after menopause than in similarly-aged, premenopausal women,\u201d he said. \u201cThey also had higher levels of an early marker for arteriosclerosis.\"\n\nThe study, which is published in The American Journal of Physiology, shows that these adverse effects may be reined in with some team-based exercise. For their investigation, the researcher picked floorball. For the uninitiated: Floorball is a type of floor hockey extremely popular in Scandinavia and, according to \u201cGeneration Floorball,\u201d sort of popular in the U.S.\n\nAccording to Jens Bangsbo, senior author and director of the University of Copenhagen\u2019s Centre for Team Sport and Health, the 13 postmenopausal women involved in the study showed clear results surprisingly fast. \"Following just 12 weeks of twice weekly practices, the women's conditions had improved and their blood pressure was reduced by four millimeters of mercury, which correlates with a 40 percent lower risk of stroke,\" he explained. \"Furthermore, there was a positive development in relation to levels of substances vital to blood vessel function, including a 20 percent decrease in markers associated with arteriosclerosis.\"\n\nWhile several previous studies have linked similar health benefits to regular exercise, the authors believe floorball and similar sports stand out, as they require constant teamwork and commitment. This way, adherence to the workout regimen naturally becomes much easier. It\u2019s also way more fun, Nyberg adds.\n\n\u201cFloorball training is intense, with many short sprints, directional changes, and a high pulse achieved \u2013\u2013 but participants don't really pay attention to all of this,\u201d he explained. \u201cThis high intensity is one of the primary reasons that these women were able to achieve such great health benefits in just 12 weeks.\u201d\n\nTeam Sports and Your Heart\n\nCardiovascular events like heart attack and stroke are currently the nation\u2019s most common causes of death, killing around 2,200 Americans every day. Arteriosclerosis and high blood pressure are both considered precursors of these complications. You can learn more about heart disease and how to prevent it here.\n\nUltimately, team sports focusing on explosive interval exercise may be favorable alternatives to traditional pharmacological solutions like hormone therapy. Floorball, after all, doesn\u2019t come with any side-effects. \"The fact that participants thought that it was fun and enjoyed being with other women also lead to their insistence on continuing with the sport after the study's conclusion \u2013\u2013 which addresses a fundamental issue: How is it possible to motivate and not least, keep people interested in a healthy physical activity,\u201d Bangsbo told reporters. \u201cTeam sport is the answer.\"\n\nSource: Nyberg M, Seidelin K, Rostgaard Andersen T, Neumann Overby N, Hellsten Y, Bangsbo J.
