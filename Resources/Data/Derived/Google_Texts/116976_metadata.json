John Danforth was a new Republican senator from Missouri, a millionaire who had unseated the old liberal Democrat Stuart Symington in 1976. Danforth urged his fellow Republicans to join him in honoring King. Armed with a divinity degree, Danforth was helping to refashion the GOP as a crucible for the mixing of church and state\u2014just as Jimmy Carter and Jesse Jackson were using public displays of religion to challenge the Democratic establishment. Danforth believed he was following Martin Luther King\u2019s example.\n\nDanforth later revealed that he had gotten to know King and King\u2019s father when he served as a board member of King\u2019s alma mater, Morehouse College. He did not want champions of the welfare state to have a monopoly on public claims of morality and decency. To Danforth, King\u2019s determination in the fight for equality symbolized \u2015the spirit of American freedom and self-determination.\u201d Was Danforth\u2019s view of King\u2019s legacy in step with the growing body of social conservatives, who were campaigning vigorously to take over the GOP and the country? That question still appeared to be open, what with much of the pro-life movement claiming King as an inspiration and model, and with at least two Republican presidential candidates (John Connally and John Anderson) making a great show of repudiating their former opposition to King and civil rights. Danforth signaled a new possibility for conservative Republicans: They could claim some affinity, even allegiance, to King\u2019s mantle. They may not have wanted to convince many black voters, and they did not need to. White conservatives in particular recognized in King a model to emulate\u2014notably his use of religious enthusiasm and will-to-sacrifice. Nobody better illustrated Coretta Scott King\u2019s point that King had spoken \u201cto us all.\u201d\n\n* * *\n\nOther conservatives got in Danforth\u2019s way, however, with tough ideological attacks on King\u2019s legacy. When Senator Strom Thurmond reconvened the joint hearing, opponents of the King holiday were given the most room they ever had in the record. First was Alan Stang, author of an anticommunist tract, \u201cIt\u2019s Very Simple: The True Story of Civil Rights\u201d (1965). Stang enumerated King\u2019s alleged communist associations more clearly than any holiday opponent had done on the record before. He also did a better job than anyone had in spelling out the claim that King provoked violence. To people who wondered why \u201cviolence was so often a hallmark of King\u2019s so-called nonviolent movement,\u201d Stang answered that \u201cviolence was exactly what he wanted,\u201d citing King\u2019s own article in the April 3, 1964, Saturday Review. There King laid out his strategy: Nonviolent demonstrators went into the streets to exercise their rights, and racists resisted by unleashing violence against them, which led \u201cAmericans of conscience\u201d to demand federal intervention and legislation. \u201cSo,\u201d Stang concluded, \u201cthe violence he [King] got was not a surprise\u201d and King \u201cdid not dislike it. He wanted it in order to pressure the Congress to enact still more totalitarian legislation.\u201d\n\nThurmond called a real live communist next: Julia Brown, a self-identified \u201cloyal American Negro,\u201d who worked as a communist organizer beginning in 1947. At first, Brown had thought she was \u201cjoining a legitimate civil rights organization[.] Finding that I was a true member of the Communist Party[,] which advocated the overthrow of the United States Government, I decided to leave the organization, but I had to bide my time to avoid suspicion.\u201d Soon she went to the FBI to report what she had witnessed. \u201cIn 1951, I was asked by the FBI to go back into the Communist Party as an undercover agent to report on their subversive activities.\u201d She claimed that only party members attended the meetings she attended. She \u201cfrequently heard Martin Luther King discussed.\u201d The communist cells she was in were \u201ccontinually being asked to raise money for Martin Luther King\u2019s activities and to support his civil rights movement by writing letters to the press and influencing local clergymen, and especially Negro clergymen that he was a good person, unselfishly working for the American Negro, and in no way connected with the Communist Party.\u201d\n\nBrown proposed an ingenious way to counter all that communist influence: \u201c[A] great many Negroes, such as George Washington Carver and Booker T. Washington,\u201d provide American youth with a positive example. King, by contrast, provided an example of \u201cagitation and manipulation for goals dictated by hatred and envy.\u201d If the committee recommended a King holiday, \u201cThe memory of Carver and Washington would be dishonored.\u201d If the holiday bill passed, \u201cwe may as well take down the Stars and Stripes that fly over this building and replace it with a Red flag.\u201d Similar testimony came from Karl Prussion, a former undercover FBI agent.\n\nLarry McDonald then stepped up and brought affirmative action, which had been upheld in the Supreme Court\u2019s 1978 Bakke decision, into the discussion. He questioned whether King \u201creally found racism repugnant in light of his support of discrimination in jobs and housing so long as the discrimination was in favor of blacks.\u201d King\u2019s forming a \u201ccommon front\u201d with the \u201cvirulently racist Nation of Islam\u201d in Chicago raised the same question. McDonald qualified his points: \u201cWhile Rev. King did not advocate race hatred, he did not bar alliances with racists and he did not keep them from his personal staff.\u201d McDonald gave a single quotation to back up the second claim: King\u2019s staff member James Bevel said in 1966 in Chicago that \u201cwe need an army . . . to fight the white man this summer.\u201d King\u2019s civil disobedience dangerously taught young people \u201ccontempt for the law.\u201d A King holiday would teach the same lesson.\n\nJohn Ashbrook did not show up for the hearing, but he joined McDonald in submitting a written statement. \u201cIt is not popular and certainly not politically advantageous to speak in opposition to a man who has been canonized by the news media and by many . . . who profess to advocate civil rights,\u201d Ashbrook acknowledged. But \u201cRev. King\u2019s motives are misrepresented. He sought not to work through the law but around it, with contempt and violence. How soon we forget. When will politicians learn to accept history as it really happened instead of history as told by the Washington Post?\u201d The issue was whether Congress would \u201csupport the fictional assessment of Dr. King\u201d by adopting a holiday that would \u201ctake the taxpayers for a ride to the tune of millions and millions of dollars\u201d and whether America\u2019s children would \u201cbe misled into believing\u201d that King was a great man and learn to speak of him \u201cwith the same reverence\u201d they now reserve for Washington and Lincoln.\n\nA Statue in Lieu of a Holiday?\n\nLack of coordination among conservatives became more evident when King was next discussed on the floor of Congress at the end of July. The provocation was a resolution dating back several years to erect a statue of King somewhere on the Capitol grounds. It actually passed both houses in the 94th Congress (1975\u201376), but since the Senate version passed only at the very end of term, the House did not have time to consider the Senate amendments. In the 95th Congress (1977\u201378), the House passed it, but not the Senate. It would cost $25,000, out of contingent funds already appropriated. It would be the first work of art displayed in the Capitol that memorialized a black American. (There were then 681 that did not memorialize black Americans.) Its author, Democrat Jonathan Bingham of New York, said it had passed before with \u201clittle or no dissent.\u201d\n\nAshbrook put an end to that. He was \u201csad\u201d that no black leader was memorialized in the Capitol, but this particular leader would soon be revealed as an \u201cinappropriate choice.\u201d Time and history would \u201cshow that there could have been much better choices.\u201d History had a way of reappraising once-popular leaders\u2014he repeated Thurmond\u2019s example of John Kennedy, and added Lyndon Johnson and J. Edgar Hoover. Ashbrook was the difference be-ween little and no dissent in the past. He was the only one to speak against the King statue now.\n\nRising to speak against Ashbrook was none other than freshman congressman Newt Gingrich. \u201cAs a representative of Georgia,\u201d Gingrich said that a King statue would be \u201can important symbol. It is very clear in the black community that this is the overwhelming choice of that community.\u201d Gingrich occupied the district adjacent to Larry McDonald\u2019s in the booming suburbs of Atlanta. The statue passed overwhelmingly\u2014supported by many who opposed the holiday\u2014408 to 11.\n\nEnactment of the statue statute appeared to be a rehearsal for the holiday vote to come. The vote here easily topped the two-thirds majority necessary to pass on a \u201csuspension of rules,\u201d that is to say, quickly, and without the elaborate rigmarole the House insists upon for controversial legislation.\n\nAshbrook weighed in again on September 27, 1979, before the House committee took final action that year on the holiday bill. Ashbrook attacked the King Center by citing a news story that contained a wealth of damning circumstantial evidence about its finances, particularly suggesting a quid pro quo from the Carter administration, which had greatly increased the center\u2019s public funding. The story quoted the artlessly evasive nondenials of a King Center spokesman. Ashbrook seemed to be testing whether any dirt could stick to the great Teflon icon of civil rights, whether his attack on the fundamental basis of the King holiday\u2014as opposed to its price tag\u2014could draw support anywhere but the outer fringes he and Larry McDonald hovered around.\n\nThe Holiday Nearly Passes\n\nHe had his answer soon. The House Committee on Post Office and Civil Service finally reported the holiday bill to the floor, favorably, on October 23, 1979. Its minority report\u2014signed by only five of the committee\u2019s nine Republicans\u2014conspicuously left out any negative statements or insinuations about King or his associations. It included only two objections to the holiday. Most important was a concise\u2014and persuasive\u2014objection to the majority\u2019s fuzzy math on its cost. An ancillary concern was whether Congress should single out King\u2014whom the minority praised\u2014for an honor it denied to Jefferson, Lincoln, Theodore Roosevelt, and Franklin Roosevelt. These objections were confirmed as the respectable bases of opposition to the holiday. Fiscal discipline and an unwillingness to put King on a pedestal above long-hallowed national heroes constituted the broadest argument that could plausibly attract a majority.\n\nOpponents of the holiday could have said: Congress already honored King with substantive action, in the Fair Housing Act of 1968. To point to the superfluity of an additional tribute would have bolstered the most effective point that holiday opponents made, though they never emphasized or belabored it: A Martin Luther King holiday would be an odd, cult-of-personality-like gesture, the sort of thing that King had always opposed. To point to Congress\u2019s substantive tribute to King from 1968 would also have given holiday opponents the cover of respectability that they clearly sought. It would have backed up their claim that they really respected King; they just did not think a holiday was the most apt way to honor him.\n\nOn November 13, 1979, an overwhelming majority of House members\u2014252 to 133\u2014voted to enact a federal holiday in honor of King on his birthday, January 15, every year. But that was not quite the two-thirds majority needed to speed the bill through Congress on the \u201csuspension of rules\u201d that holiday sponsors had somewhat overconfidently attempted. Holiday supporters were able to get the bill on the docket one more time days before the end of the session, on December 5, 1979. This time it could be carried by a simple majority, but congressional rules would allow opponents to delay action on the bill, or to attach weakening amendments to it.\n\nA pro-holiday substitute amendment, offered by Republican Robert McClory of suburban Chicago, appeared to meet the cost argument halfway by changing the date of the King holiday from January 15 every year to the third Monday every January: a three-day weekend would not be as costly as the midweek interruptions that would occur almost half the time January 15 came up.\n\nHoliday opponents tended to support a different substitute, to divert holiday feeling into a proclamation of commemoration of King\u2019s birthday on the third Sunday of every January. The sponsor of the Sunday switch was the conservative Republican Robin Beard, whose district included several white precincts of Memphis and ran east to the outskirts of Nashville. Holiday supporters objected that a Sunday commemoration would eliminate all the honor that the holiday campaign had intended\u2014and that the House had just voted overwhelmingly for on November 13. Cardiss Collins of Chicago\u2019s West Side, speaking for the whole Black Caucus, said Beard\u2019s version of King Day would be \u201ca holiday in name only. We all know that many commemorative days and weeks have little meaning to the public.\u201d She wondered aloud how many present celebrated National Safe Boating Week, National Poison Prevention Week, or Pan-American Aviation Day, Stephen Foster Day, and Leif Ericson Day.\n\nJohn Conyers and other longtime holiday supporters supported the McClory (Monday) amendment from the start. It passed overwhelmingly, 291\u2013106, on December 5, 1979. That was well over the two-thirds majority that holiday supporters had needed back on November 13, though that was immaterial now. With a simple majority, it appeared that King\u2019s supporters had at last gotten their holiday.\n\nBut Beard\u2019s amendment came up ten minutes later and also carried, though narrowly: 207 in favor of the Sunday substitute, and 191 against. Holiday supporters, led by Conyers and Democratic congressman Robert Garcia of New York City, moved a petition to withdraw the whole bill in response. Thus, after building support for it all year, the Congressional Black Caucus and House liberals killed the proclamation of a national \u201cMartin Luther King Day\u201d just forty days before King\u2019s fifty-first birthday. That was better than yielding to a phony \u201choliday\u201d on a Sunday\u2014which would have been hard to repeal down the road in favor of a real, weekday holiday. To block the Sunday substitute was the best they could do for now. They kept the possibility open that they could regroup and rally holiday support more effectively in a future Congress.\n\nThe Holiday Rises Again\n\nHow often does a second chance come? A big event came between the holiday bill\u2019s sea-sickening swings and withdrawal in 1979 and the next round of debate and voting, in 1982\u201383. That event is often described as a revolution: Americans elected their most conservative president since 1928.\n\nHow quixotic it appeared\u2014in the face of the man who resurrected the GOP from Watergate and decisively moved the voters away from their familiar ideological center\u2014to revive the holiday bill in 1982. Not only was Ronald Reagan on the record as not supporting the King holiday, but the case against the holiday had certainly grown. The 1981\u201382 recession strengthened the argument that it was risky to shut the economy down for an additional three-day weekend every winter. Did CBC members actually expect enough Republicans to turn against Reagan and support the holiday? Or did they only wish to dramatize the CBC\u2019s own victimization with an operatic auto-da-f\u00e9?
