All the names, street addresses, email addresses, and phone numbers that matter to me are still on paper, not in a computer or on an iPhone, and it\u2019s not complicated to know what that means: I\u2019m an old guy getting older. Going on 71, though I can hardly believe it. And that little book shows all the signs of where I\u2019m headed. It wasn\u2019t true a few years ago, but if I start flipping through the pages now, I can\u2019t help but notice that the dead, with their addresses and phone numbers still beside them, are creeping up on the living, and that my little address book looks increasingly like a mausoleum.\n\nAge has been on my mind of late, especially when I spend time with you. This year, my father, your great-grandfather, who died in 1983, would have been 109 years old. And somehow, I find that moving. I feel him a part of me in ways I wouldn\u2019t have allowed myself to admit in my youth, and so think of myself as more than a century old. Strangely, this leaves me with a modest, very personal sense of hope. Through my children (and perhaps you, too), someday long after I\u2019m gone, I can imagine myself older still. Don\u2019t misunderstand me: I haven\u2019t a spiritual bone in my body, but I do think that, in some fashion, we continue to live inside each other and so carry each other onward.\n\nAs happens with someone of my age, the future seems to be foreshortening and yet it remains the remarkable mystery it\u2019s always been. We can\u2019t help ourselves: we dream about, wonder about, and predict what the future might hold in store for us. It\u2019s an urge that, I suspect, is hardwired into us. Yet, curiously enough, we\u2019re regularly wrong in the futures we dream up. Every now and then, though, you peer ahead and see something that proves \u2014 thanks to your perceptiveness or pure dumb luck (there\u2019s no way to know which) \u2014 eerily on target.\n\nThe Future Foreseen\n\nBack in 2001, before I even imagined a grandson in my life, I had one of those moments (and wish I hadn\u2019t). It was sometime just after the 9/11 attacks when, nationwide, Americans were still engaged in endless rites in which we repeatedly elevated ourselves to the status of the foremost victims on the planet, the only ones that mattered. In those months, you might say, we made ourselves into Earth\u2019s indispensible or exceptional victims.\n\nIn that extended moment of national mourning (combined with fear bordering on hysteria), the Bush administration geared up to launch its revenge-fueled global wars, while money started pouring into the national security state in a historically unprecedented way. It was a time when the previously un-American word \u201chomeland\u201d was being attached to what would become a second defense department, secrecy was descending like a blanket on the government, torture was morphing into the enhancement of the week in the White House, assassination was about to become a focus (later an obsession) of the executive branch \u2014 and surveillance? Don\u2019t even get me started on the massively redundant domestic and global surveillance state that would soon be built on outright illegalities and rubber-stamp legalitiesof every sort.\n\nIn October 2001, I had no way of grasping most of that, but it didn\u2019t matter. I peered into the future and just knew \u2014 and what I knew chilled me to the bone. I had mobilized decades earlier as part of the antiwar movement of the Vietnam era, which was in its own way a terrible time, but when I looked at where our country seemed to be heading, as the president promised to kick some ass globally and American bombs began to fall on Afghanistan, I had no doubt that this was going to be the worst era of my life.\n\nI wasn\u2019t, of course, thinking about you that October and November. You were then minus 11 years old, so to speak. I was, however, thinking about your mother and your uncle, my children. I was thinking about the world that I and my cohorts and George W. Bush and Dick Cheney and George Tenet and Donald Rumsfeld and the rest of that crew were going to leave them.\n\nIn a quiet way I had done good work \u2014 so I felt \u2014 since demobilizing (like so many Americans) from the Vietnam era. In my spare time as a non-academic, I had written a very personal history of the Cold War of which I was proud. I had been a book editor for two publishing houses, specializing in bringing into the world works by what I used to call \u201cvoices from elsewhere\u201d (even when they came from here), including, to name just two, Chalmers Johnson\u2019s Blowback and Eduardo Galeano\u2019s Memory of Fire trilogy.\n\nBut when I somehow stumbled into the future in all its grim horror, more of that work didn\u2019t seem like an adequate response to what was coming. I had no sense that I could do much, but I felt an urge that seemed uncomplicated: not to hand your mother and uncle such a degraded country, planet, new century without lifting a finger in opposition, without at least trying. I felt the need to mobilize myself in a new way for the future I\u2019d seen.\n\nAt that point, however, my knack, such as it was, for previewing the years to come failed me and I had no sense of what to do until TomDispatch more or less smacked me in the face. (But that\u2019s a story for another day.) This April, more than 13 years after I first began sending missives to the no-name listserv that turned into TomDispatch, it\u2019s clear that, in my own idiosyncratic way, I did manage to mobilize myself to do what I was capable of. Unfortunately, I\u2019d have to add that, all this time later, our world is a far more screwed up, degraded place.\n\nA Fragmenting Reality\n\nStretch anything far enough and it\u2019ll begin to tear, fragment, break apart. That, I suspect, may be a reasonable summary of what\u2019s been happening in our twenty-first-century world. Under stress, things are beginning to crack open. Here in the U.S., people sometimes speak about being in a Second Gilded Age, a new era of plutocracy, while our politics, increasingly the arena of billionaires, seem to second that possibility. Looked at another way, however, \u201cour\u201d Second Gilded Age is really a global phenomenon in the sense that ever fewer people own ever more. By 2016, it is estimated that 1% of the people on this planet will control more than 50% of global wealth and own more than the other 99% combined. In 2013, the 85 richest people had as much wealth as the poorest 3.5 billion, while in certain regions inequality seems to be on the rise. (Whether China and India are major exceptions to this is an open question.) Dark money is rampant not just here, but globally.\n\nThough you don\u2019t know it yet, you\u2019re already living in an increasingly lopsided world whose stresses only seem to be multiplying. Among other things, there is the literal fragmentation going on \u2014 the collapse of social order, of long established national units, even potentially of whole groupings of states. Astonishingly enough, from Ukraine to Greece, Spain to France, that mood of fragmentation even seems to be reaching into Europe. Across much of the Greater Middle East and parts of Africa, fragmentation has, of course, been the story of our moment, with nations collapsing, wars endemic, extremism of every sort on the rise, and whole populations uprooted, in exile, under almost inconceivable pressures \u2014 and for much of this, I\u2019m sad to say, our country bears a painful responsibility.\n\nIn these years, I wrote repeatedly (not to say repetitiously) on the subject; about, that is, a group of mad American visionaries who had dreams of establishing a Pax Americana in the Greater Middle East by force of arms and then lording it over the world for generations to come. In the name of freedom and democracy and with a fundamentalist belief in the transformational power of the U.S. military, they blithely invaded Iraq and blew a hole in the heart of the Middle East, from which the fallout is now horrifically apparent in the Islamic State and its \u201ccaliphate.\u201d\n\nAnd then, of course, there was our country\u2019s endless string of failed wars, interventions, raids, assassination campaigns, and the like; there was, in short, the \u201cglobal war on terror\u201d that George W. Bush launched to scourge the planet of \u201cterrorists,\u201d to (as they then liked to say) \u201cdrain the swamp\u201d in 80 countries. It was a \u201cwar\u201d that, with all its excesses, quickly morphed into a recruiting poster for the spread of extremist outfits. By now, it has become so institutionalized that it wouldn\u2019t surprise me if, in your adulthood, Washington were still pursuing it no less relentlessly or unsuccessfully.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The war on terror, an apathetic electorate and state-sanctioned torture -- this is the America I'm leaving behind", "title": "\u201cIt\u2019s not the country I imagined for you\u201d: A letter of apology to my grandson", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The war on terror, an apathetic electorate and state-sanctioned torture -- this is the America I'm leaving behind", "title": "\u201cIt\u2019s not the country I imagined for you\u201d: A letter of apology to my grandson", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/04/25/its_not_the_country_i_imagined_for_you_a_letter_of_apology_to_my_grandson_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/09/shutterstock_856886981.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The war on terror, an apathetic electorate and state-sanctioned torture -- this is the America I'm leaving behind", "title": "\u201cIt\u2019s not the country I imagined for you\u201d: A letter of apology to my grandson", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/09/shutterstock_856886981.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Tom Engelhardt", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, TomDispatch", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc5f4\"", "article_summary": "The Future ForeseenBack in 2001, before I even imagined a grandson in my life, I had one of those moments (and wish I hadn\u2019t).\nWe can\u2019t help ourselves: we dream about, wonder about, and predict what the future might hold in store for us.\nThrough my children (and perhaps you, too), someday long after I\u2019m gone, I can imagine myself older still.\nAstonishingly enough, from Ukraine to Greece, Spain to France, that mood of fragmentation even seems to be reaching into Europe.\nIt was a \u201cwar\u201d that, with all its excesses, quickly morphed into a recruiting poster for the spread of extremist outfits."}
