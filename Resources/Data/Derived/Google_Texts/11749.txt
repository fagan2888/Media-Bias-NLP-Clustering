Barack Obama may have beaten Mitt Romney (pictured posting up against a comfy chair) in 2012’s presidential race. The former governor of Massachusetts bested him in 2015’s NCAA basketball tournament.

Mitt Romney’s bracket correctly picked Duke and Wisconsin to play in the national championship game. His picks put him in elite company–the top tenth of a percent of everyone filling out brackets at ESPN. Only about 25,000 brackets at the sports site meet or beat the 2012 Republican presidential nominee.

By way of comparison, about seven million brackets at ESPN meet or beat the president’s. Obama picked the Wildcats (Kentucky) over the Wildcats (Villanova) in the national championship. Wisconsin bounced previously unbeaten Kentucky Saturday night. The NC State Wolfpack sent Villanova home in the round of 32.

Politico, Rolling Stone (can’t get the campus past right let alone the future), the Huffington Post, and other sites punishing Romney during the campaign now give him props over his hoops wisdom. Bracketology joins Iran and millions of Americans losing their health insurance because of ObamaCare as issues where Romney can tell the president, “I told you so.”

The one-percenter picks Duke, winner of four tournaments all in the last quarter century, to defeat Wisconsin, winner of a single tournament six years before Romney’s birth, in tonight’s national championship game.

The rich, as Romney’s foes might have predicted regarding his predictions, get richer.
