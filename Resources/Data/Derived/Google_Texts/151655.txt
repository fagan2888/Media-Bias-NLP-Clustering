Jax leaves in two weeks to start rehearsals for the 37-city "American Idol Live!" tour.

"American Idol" Top 3 finalist Jax, who lives in East Brunswick, is holding a meet-and-greet for her Jax Pack on from 5 to 8 p.m. Tuesday at Casa Guiseppe, 487 Route 27, in the Iselin section of the township.

"Actually scratch that..I hate the words meet-and-greet. It makes it sound like I'm more important than you guys," Jax said on Twitter. "I'm calling it a Pizza Party."

Jax Pack members, who have become friendly with each other on Twitter, have already made their intentions and excitement known.

"Ahhh!!! My #jaxpack friends r coming to the pizza party for @Jax and I'm so excited to finally meet them!," tweeted Eda Katgi, 15, of East Brunswick.

"My two favorite at the same time!?," said Don Gloria on Twitter. "Jax and Pizza! Its gonna be the best day of my life!"

Others expressed dismay that either because of finals or where they live, they are unable to attend.

"Google maps says 7 hours to drive! Can you believe I looked?!," said Amy Elizabeth, who lives in Canada.

Busy since Season XIV of "American Idol" ended, Jax has made time to meet with her beloved Jax Pack as much as possible. She leaves for "America Idol Live!" tour rehearsals in two weeks and plans to do many more meet-and-greet sessions during the 37-city tour.

"My Jax Pack means everything to me," Jax said. "This is why I do what I do."
