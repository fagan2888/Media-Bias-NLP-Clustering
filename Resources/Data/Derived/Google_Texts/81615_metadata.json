(WWLP) \u2013 People are losing their jobs in the Baystate Health System and we now know that \u201cObamacare\u201d played a role. It\u2019s a story the 22News I-Team has been covering for months. We\u2019ve been talking about the potential of higher health insurance premiums, which could still happen, but the first negative impact of the Affordable Care Act in Massachusetts is people losing their jobs.\n\nBaystate Health laid off 24 workers last week. Baystate officials told 22News one of the factors was the estimated payments they\u2019ll be making due to a provision of the Affordable Care Act. The provision is called risk-adjustment.\n\nHealth insurance companies in Massachusetts that have sicker patients will receive payments from the state\u2019s other insurance companies. The estimates have been in the millions and it will impact Health New England, which is part of Baystate Health.\n\nCongressman Richard Neal toured Baystate on Monday and defended the Affordable Care Act. \u201c99% of the people of Massachusetts, I believe, are insured and 100% of the children, something is going right,\u201d said Congressman Neal, (D) Massachusetts.\n\nIn April, it was estimated that Health New England will owe $30 million for risk adjustment in 2015. The latest estimates are lower, but we won\u2019t know the exact number until late June.\n\nBaystate said it\u2019s facing a $22 million budget shortfall.\n\nThe amount of Medicare and Medicaid reimbursements they receive are the other main factors that resulted in layoffs. Baystate Health officials say the price of treating Medicaid patients is costing them jobs. Part of the reason for the job cuts is the amount of money Baystate receives for Medicaid and Medicare reimbursements from the government. Baystate says they only get 70 to 80 cents on the dollar.\n\n\u201cSeldom are wage index issues or reimbursements based on legislation they tend to be based on administrative issues that are made by CMS (Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services),\u201d said Congressman Neal.\n\nBaystate is the 3rd largest Medicaid provider in Massachusetts.", "article_metadata": {"bing-site-verification": "23CDEE3A27AFAAFA06AA97D2752E7BC3", "news_keywords": "baystate, healthcare, 22news, wwlp, i-team, ryan walsh, affordable care act, obamacare, jobs, medicaid, medicare", "generator": "WordPress.com", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.linmedia.newstouch.wwlp", "og": {"site_name": "WWLP.com", "description": "People are losing their jobs in the Baystate Health System and we now know that \u201cObamacare\u201d played a role.", "title": "Affordable Care Act, Medicaid reimbursements cost Baystate jobs", "url": "http://wwlp.com/2015/06/08/affordable-care-act-medicaid-reimbursements-cost-baystate-jobs/", "image": {"width": 650, "identifier": "https://lintvwwlp.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/bstate.jpg", "height": 366}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "People are losing their jobs in the Baystate Health System and we now know that \u201cObamacare\u201d played a role.", "title": "Affordable Care Act, Medicaid reimbursements cost Baystate jobs", "image": {"src": "https://lintvwwlp.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/bstate.jpg?w=640"}, "creator": "@WWLP22News", "site": "WWLP22News", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "Western Massachusetts Breaking News, Weather", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=488537620", "fb": {"pages": 16780999098}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://wwlp.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/82beb0f66fcee4174912ea30f52087cc?s=16", "application-name": "WWLP.com", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/WWLP22News", "published_time": "2015-06-08T21:54:10+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-08T22:03:10+00:00"}, "keywords": "breaking news, weather, investigative reports, springfield news, chicopee news, northampton news, amherst news, greenfield news, hampshire county, hampden county, berkshires, Connecticut river valley, pioneer valley, westfield news, western massachusetts, national news, headlines, online, nbc news", "google-site-verification": "6YJPKhiEei9MITNyJe-rDmtJtJ8OhKZ_QWocROYaWIU", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "People are losing their jobs in the Baystate Health System and we now know that \"Obamacare\" played a role."}, "article_summary": "Baystate officials told 22News one of the factors was the estimated payments they\u2019ll be making due to a provision of the Affordable Care Act.\n(WWLP) \u2013 People are losing their jobs in the Baystate Health System and we now know that \u201cObamacare\u201d played a role.\nCongressman Richard Neal toured Baystate on Monday and defended the Affordable Care Act.\nThe estimates have been in the millions and it will impact Health New England, which is part of Baystate Health.\nWe\u2019ve been talking about the potential of higher health insurance premiums, which could still happen, but the first negative impact of the Affordable Care Act in Massachusetts is people losing their jobs."}
