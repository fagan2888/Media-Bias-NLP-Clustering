(AP) - A web. A bridge. A helping hand.\n\nThese are the roles the Cook family envisions for their budding project: a peer-to-peer support system for children and teens battling depression and suicidal thoughts - and a place where young people can always find a friend.\n\nTogether, Craig Cook, Cate Cook and daughter Madison Uehara are working to create an organization called STAY, an acronym for \u201csuicide touches all youths.\u201d The group is currently based out of the Cooks\u2019 home, and their headquarters is a room designated as \u201cSTAY central,\u201d where members jot down ideas for goals and outreach.\n\n\u201cI wish that everybody could find a place where they don\u2019t feel alone - together,\u201d Maddie says in a written note.\n\nCraig Cook said the concept for the organization grew from a combination of factors - the deaths of Laramie High School and University of Wyoming students in the past year, as well as the struggles of other young people in the community. The family wanted to find a way to help, he said.\n\n\u201cKids don\u2019t like to talk to adults,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd so if there\u2019s a troubled adolescent and their only resource is some adult organization or school psychologist, they don\u2019t engage with folks like that. So STAY became an organization where a troubled adolescent can talk to an adolescent that may have gone through or may still be going through the same thing.\u201d\n\nFor Madison, an incoming LHS sophomore, suicide has been an incredibly personal struggle.\n\n\u201cI have lost two friends in the past year to suicide, and that\u2019s been pretty hard,\u201d she said. \u201cBut another issue is I nearly lost myself to it a few times.\u201d\n\nThe family hopes to make STAY a strong community presence in time for the new school year. The organization already has a business license and is working on acquiring tax-exempt status; the next major step is creating a running website and establishing profiles on social media.\n\nSeveral students have already expressed an interest in joining STAY, Cate Cook said. And while adults will provide some oversight, the organization should ultimately be run by the most affected group - the youth.\n\nVolunteers will receive professional training on how to help their peers, Cate Cook said.\n\n\u201cIt touches everybody, creates a bigger ripple effect,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd nobody knows what someone might be, if they had stayed.\u201d\n\nOne of the main problems STAY plans to tackle is self-injury, which can often be a precursor to suicide, or suicidal thoughts.\n\n\u201cA huge problem is people glorifying suicide, cutting,\u201d Madison said. \u201cI think it started out as someone trying to make another person feel better, but now there is the horrible fact that anywhere you go on the Internet, you can probably find a picture of someone who thinks that cutting is attractive, when in reality, it\u2019s really kind of a grim thing.\u201d\n\nCate Cook\u2019s biggest hope is that the organization will be inclusive to adolescents from all walks of life - a safe place where they can feel comfortable talking about the challenges they face.\n\n\u201cWe want to make sure that STAY is accessible to all youth, not just the kids on the fringes,\u201d she said. \u201cNot just the jocks, or the 4-H-ers or the LGBTQ. There\u2019s an understanding that we really want everyone to stay.\u201d\n\nBecause asking for help can be an intimidating prospect, Madison plans to design youth-friendly pamphlets that resemble notes students might pass in class. Inside, the notes would contain a message of encouragement; on the back, they\u2019d list information about STAY and other helpful resources such as suicide hotlines. Ideally, the notes would be readily available at schools and places like coffee shops, Madison said.\n\n\u201cWe want it available for pretty much anyone to grab, whether they\u2019re reading it for themselves or giving it to a friend,\u201d she said.\n\nAs the organization gets off the ground, Madison said, she\u2019ll be available to talk to any young person in need of help, whether through Facebook, texting, phone calls or face-to-face conversations.\n\n\u201cSTAY will be a hand reached out that anyone can grab,\u201d she said.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Laramie Boomerang, http://www.laramieboomerang.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "A web.
