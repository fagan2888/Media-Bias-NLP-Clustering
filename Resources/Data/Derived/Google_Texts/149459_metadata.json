The AFL-CIO has signed partnership agreements with two such groups, the National Day Labor Organizing Network and the National Domestic Workers Alliance; has issued a formal charter to another such group, the New York Taxi Workers Alliance, as an AFL-CIO affiliate; and recently announced a major expansion of its own top alt-labor experiment: Working America, an affiliate for non-union workers which is expanding to all fifty states and taking up workplace organizing. \u201cThe alt-labor stuff has been huge in the whole conversation,\u201d one participant in an AFL-CIO pre-convention committees told The Nation. In the past, he said, the conversation around expanding the labor movement beyond union membership was limited to \u201cCan people who aren\u2019t currently in a union get a credit card that says AFL-CIO on it?\u201d\n\nBecker told The Nation that he hopes the AFL-CIO will pursue \u201csome limited, thoughtful experiments\u201d backing additional alt-labor efforts. Unions already provide\u2014along with foundations\u2014a substantial portion of the funding for many such organizations. Trumka told The Nation in April that while collective bargaining remains \u201cone of the best ways\u201d to \u201cactually bring down inequality,\u201d \u201cthere are other tools that we will experiment with.\u201d\n\nAlt-labor will also be on display when the AFL-CIO presents its George Meany\u2014Lane Kirkland Human Rights Award to the International Domestic Workers\u2019 Network, which in 2011 scored a major victory with the passage of a landmark new International Labor Organization convention on the right of domestic workers, who do cleaning and caring work in the home. Such workers are among the growing portion of the US workforce that\u2019s implicitly or explicitly excluded from the legal collective bargaining rights established under the New Deal. Ad Policy\n\nPolitics\n\nA transformation of those New Deal labor laws is among the priorities set forth in convention resolutions filed by the federation\u2019s decision-making body. A resolution from the AFL-CIO Executive Committee and one of its pre-convention committees a pledges a \u201cmultiyear\u201d campaign for labor law reforms that would echo the three key planks of the failed Employee Free Choice Act, and also go much further: extending collective bargaining rights to many currently excluded workers; guaranteeing organizers the right to visit the workplace and workers the right not to attend anti-union lectures; allowing states to pass more sweeping pro-labor laws or barring them from passing \u201cright to work\u201d; and addressing the \u201cwho\u2019s the boss?\u201d problem facing increasing numbers of workers by ensuring \u201cthat the entity that holds the real authority over workers\u2019 terms and conditions of employment, even if it is not the workers\u2019 direct employer, comes to the table in bargaining.\u201d\n\nThe Executive Council has also backed resolutions supporting Dodd-Frank implementation, progressive bankruptcy reforms, immigration reform, voting rights, campaign finance reform, and filibuster reform, and a resolution decrying that \u201cour nation\u2019s profit-driven justice system is producing a level of mass incarceration that is anything but just.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s foolhardy to focus on economic justice and not democracy\u201d as well, Communications Workers of America President Larry Cohen told The Nation this summer. \u201cThat\u2019s impossible. You\u2019ll get crumbs as a result.\u201d GET A DIGITAL SUBSCRIPTION FOR JUST $9.50! Subscribe\n\nUC Berkeley Labor Specialist Steven Pitts, who founded the National Black Worker Center Project and served on one of the AFL-CIO\u2019s pre-convention committes, told The Nation he was \u201csuper-excited\u201d about the mass incarceration resolution, comparing its potential impact to the AFL-CIO\u2019s leftward shift over a decade ago on immigrant rights. Still, he said, \u201cthe real question is, are there are any sort of legs behind the resolution?\u201d\n\nIn contrast to some unions\u2019 call for a broad progressive political agenda, the AFL-CIO\u2019s Building and Construction Trades Division has introduced a resolution committing the federation to take \u201ca pragmatic, bipartisan approach\u201d to political work, \u201cthat focuses primarily on candidates\u2019 position on issues of direct importance to workers,\u201d and, in congressional districts favorable Republicans, to \u201cencourage moderate candidates who support fairness and equality for workers\u2026\u201d\n\nOne issue that may go unaddressed at this week\u2019s convention is President Obama\u2019s call for missile strikes in Syria, which may come before the full US Senate on Wednesday (the Syria situation led the president to cancel a planned AFL-CIO convention address). While the AFL-CIO is monitoring the situation, it has taken no position, and no convention resolutions on the issue have been introduced. Gene Bruskin, who served as secretary-treasurer of the AFL-CIO\u2019s Food and Allied Service Trades department and a decade ago helped found US Labor Against the War, said the federation\u2019s silence on the issue demonstrates how it \u201cessentially becomes the advocate for the lowest common dominator approach to things, and that ends up being a killer.\u201d\n\nThree local AFL-CIO bodies have introduced resolutions urging cuts in Pentagon spending and withdrawl from Afghanistan by the end of this year. One has introduced a resolution which would end the AFL-CIO\u2019s qualified support for the \u201ce-Verify\u201d program used to check employees\u2019 immigration status, and would urge immigration reform that is \u201cnot contingent upon border security measures.\u201d The convention also comes as some major unions have been increasingly vocal in calling for changes to the Affordable Care Act\u2019s treatment of union members\u2019 health insurance plans. Ad Policy\n\nThose issues are tied to the larger question of the federation\u2019s relationship to President Obama and the Democratic Party. \u201cIt\u2019s very much, very much being discussed\u2026,\u201d said Becker, who served as a member of the National Labor Relations Board in Obama\u2019s first term. \u201cThere is a lot of frustration with the administration, with the failure to get labor law reform at a time when it seemed possible in the House and the Senate.\u201d Becker added that there was \u201calso a recognition that the administration has faced a very difficult situation in Congress, in the House and also in the Senate.\u201d Becker noted the sense that, \u201crather than continue to build up the Democratic Party structure, or a particular candidate\u2019s structure, that you know, we ought to support the candidates who we think will further the interests of working families through our own structure.\u201d Trumka has used similar language in describing changes to the AFL-CIO political program unveiled last year.\n\nBut Columbia political scientist Dorian Warren, who participated in a pre-convention committee, said a more dramatic shift is needed: \u201cIf you just look at the immigrant rights movement, the LGBT movement, and the labor movement, two of those three have been willing to break with the president and push him hard, and have won shit. I can\u2019t say the same for labor.\u201d\n\nAsked if he wants to see a reorientation in how the federation deals with Democrats, United Steelworkers President Leo Gerard said, \u201cWe have a good relationship with the administration. Do we always get things the way we want them? No, but we always get a chance to have our voice heard, which is different from what we get under Republicans.\u201d Gerard, who chairs a pre-convention Committee on Shared Prosperity in the Global Economy, called for a \u201cmuch more aggressive\u201d popular education program to engage non-union and union workers on issues like global trade and healthcare, saying, \u201cI think that that\u2019s going to lead us in a much better direction. And we\u2019ll have to be much more assertive with Democrats who don\u2019t want to participate in that.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s a Federation For?\n\nThe Obama question, in turn, touches on a larger one: What\u2019s the purpose of a national labor federation? The AFL-CIO is, in many senses, more the servant than the master of its fifty-seven affiliated international unions, whose ideology, priorities and effectiveness vary widely. \u201cIt\u2019s a federation,\u201d said CWA\u2019s Cohen. \u201cIt\u2019s not a unified organization.\u201d\n\nSome within and outside the AFL-CIO argue that the federation\u2019s emphasis has veered too far into electoral politics and policy, rather than funding, staffing, coordinating, or supporting unionization or collective bargaining fights. Bruskin, who worked for several unions before and after his tenure at the AFL-CIO under then-President John Sweeney, argued that supporting workplace organizing campaigns \u201cdoesn\u2019t seem to be a priority for Rich [Trumka], and it was initially for John [Sweeney], but then he sort of let it go.\u201d Instead of the current approach, said Bruskin, \u201cwhat if we said that next year, we are going to take 10 percent of all the money that we would normally give to the Democratic Party, and use that ten per cent to develop a national movement to organize the unemployed, or to initiate a significant program to begin to organize the South?\u201d\n\nCohen took a different view: \u201cI think it\u2019s wrong to separate organizing work from political work. They have to be joined. And when people separate them\u2014which is mostly what\u2019s done\u2014everything goes wrong.\u201d Cohen told The Nation he hopes the convention will fuel better \u201clinkage between the two,\u201d where \u201cyou have to have workers\u2019 rights in the political work, and you have to have political work in the organizing.\u201d \u201cFor low wage people,\u201d he argued, \u201cthey need to be part of a political movement to have any hope. It\u2019s not going to change on scale anything if they\u2019re not\u2026. But I also think there\u2019s a deeper kind of political organizing that needs to go on that generally is missing right now.\u201d\n\nThe Committee on Growth, Innovation and Political Action, which Cohen co-chairs, introduced (with the AFL-CIO Executive Council) a resolution that would direct the AFL-CIO to advance organizing through steps including \u201cconvene and coordinate large-scale [organizing] efforts at the requests of affiliates that have made significant commitments on their own\u201d and \u201cdeepen its strategic campaign research capability,\u201d and would also require affiliate unions to submit annual confidential organizing plans to Trumka. The resolution also references \u201cincentives for compliance.\u201d\n\nMark Brenner, who directs the media and organizing group Labor Notes, argued there\u2019s much more the AFL-CIO could do if it were willing to \u201cruffle some feathers.\u201d Charging that top leaders of some national unions aren\u2019t interested in engaging or empowering their members, Brenner said a key question for the federation is, \u201cAre you going to break with a hundred years of history and decorum and start organizing around your affiliates?\u201d \u201cIt would be progress on its own,\u201d he said, \u201cif you could find the AFL-CIO drawing locals of various affiliates into projects that they\u2019re doing that aren\u2019t necessarily whole-heartedly embraced by their internationals.\u201d\n\nThe AFL-CIO\u2019s Becker offered a new multi-union effort at workplace and political transformation in Texas as an example of the role the federation can play in organizing: \u201cThrough the convention and beyond, the task is to put the facts on the table, to put people in a room, such that a discussion can be had that leads people to a conclusion that you know, we can\u2019t keep going it alone in this highly fragmented way.\u201d Lacking \u201ccentralized power\u201d over affiliate unions, said Becker, the federation instead needs to \u201ccreate a discussion which facilitates a conclusion that we have to work together in a systematic way in places that make sense.\u201d\n\nBecker also cited the United Auto Workers\u2019 organizing in the South, CWA\u2019s campaign at T-Mobile, the United Food & Commercial Workers-backed effort at Walmart, and Service Employees International Union-backed strikes against fast food corporations as examples of labor exploring and experimenting with \u201chow can we move into the areas we need to move and be effective?\u201d (UAW, CWA, and\u2014since its return to the federation last month\u2014UFCW are all AFL-CIO affiliates; while SEIU is not, the AFL-CIO and some of its affiliates have played roles in supporting the fast food strikers.) He added, \u201cIt\u2019s exactly what we have to do.\u201d\n\nThe convention could also see discussion of the AFL-CIO\u2019s role in discouraging \u201craids\u201d\u2014a term for efforts by one union to organize members or industries claimed by another. The International Association of Machinists introduced three proposed constitutional amendments all designed to push the AFL-CIO to more aggressively defend AFL-CIO unions from raids, while the International Union of Police Associations submitted a resolution branding the Services Employees International Union (which left the AFL-CIO in 2005) a \u201cpariah organization,\u201d and calling for some SEIU locals to be kicked out of local labor councils for raiding. (The International Longshore and Warehouse Union recently announced it was departing the AFL-CIO in large part over allegedly insufficient support against raiding by other AFL-CIO unions.)\n\nInterfaith Worker Justice founder Kim Bobo, who served on the pre-convention Committee on Community Partnerships and Grassroots Power, told The Nation she sees four key roles for the federation: a \u201cbully pulpit\u201d in representing labor\u2019s perspective in public debates; a \u201cconvening role\u201d in bringing unions together to discuss priorities, values, and shared projects; a \u201csanctioning\u201d role in discouraging raiding; and \u201cthe potential to really drive forward some new directions by investing in promising areas.\u201d Noting a recent rise in experimental efforts like the fast food strikes, Bobo said, \u201cI think we need to do just a bunch of them in different ways\u201d and then \u201csee what\u2019s working.\u201d\n\nLabor Notes director Brenner, a frequent critic of national union leaders, said he believes their existential crisis has increased major unions\u2019 openness to new strategies and allies. Whereas fifteen years ago \u201cyou wouldn\u2019t see institutions like unions eager to take the lead from someone other than themselves,\u201d he argued, now \u201cpeople are a little more comfortable with discomfort than they used to be.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Josh Eidelson", "description": "Tomorrow the AFL-CIO will kick off its quadrennial convention, a four-day Los Angeles gathering intended to shape the course of the country\u2019s largest labor federation for the next four years. The convention follows months of meetings by pre-convention committees of labor leaders, allies and academics, and dozens of listening sessions across the country, all aimed at seeking solutions to organized labor\u2019s widely acknowledged crisis. Delegates from the AFL-CIO\u2019s fifty-seven affiliated unions will hear from labor and liberal leaders (including Senator Elizabeth Warren and US Secretary of Labor Tom Perez), elect top officers to lead the federation (current President Richard Trumka and his slate are expected to win uncontested) and vote on resolutions and constitutional amendments regarding the federation\u2019s programs and priorities. I\u2019ll be covering the convention from LA over the next four days. Here\u2014based on conversations with a dozen insiders and outsiders\u2014are a few key themes to watch. Non-Labor Allies and Alt-Labor Much of mainstream media coverage of the AFL-CIO\u2019s pre-convention process has focused on the federation\u2019s talks with other progressive organizations about deepening their relationship, perhaps including a formal role for groups like the NAACP or Sierra Club in the AFL-CIO\u2019s decision-making process. The Wall Street Journal\u2019s Kris Maher reported August 29 that \u201cPushback from member unions\u201d led the federation to \u201cscale back\u201d the proposal; AFL-CIO chief of staff Jon Hiatt told Maher that a governance role was never the plan. The New York Times\u2019s Steven Greenhouse reported Saturday that Trumka wanted to \u201clet millions of nonunion workers\u2014and perhaps environmental, immigrant and other advocacy groups\u2014join the labor federation\u201d and would ask convention delegates for \u201ca green light to pursue these ambitious reforms.\u201d In an August interview with The Nation, AFL-CIO General Counsel Craig Becker acknowledged \u201creasonable concerns\u201d about offering decision-making power to groups that take corporate contributions, and said it \u201cat some fundamental level is clearly true\u201d that dues-paying union members \u201cshould control our organization.\u201d Still, he said, \u201cif we want to serve our members, you have to have some more deep and continuing relationship with your allies.\u201d In an apparent sign of skepticism, the AFL-CIO\u2019s Building and Construction Trades Department and the International Union of Operating Engineers introduced a proposed constitutional amendment under which some AFL-CIO decision-making votes could be restricted to \u201cthe members of the Executive Committee whose members\u2019 employment opportunities and jobs are directly affected,\u201d on the grounds that \u201cit is unfair to the affiliates and their membership whose employment opportunities are directly impacted\u2026to have others with no direct jobs impact to impose their views that may be based, in part, on alliances with non-labor organizations.\u201d BCTD President Sean McGarvey told Maher that Sierra Club efforts to discourage AFL-CIO support for the Keystone XL pipeline \u201cjust highlighted the audacity of people in the radical environmental movement trying to influence the policy of the labor movement.\u201d Meanwhile, since the AFL-CIO\u2019s 2009 convention, major unions, big business and mainstream media have all been paying greater attention to the rise of alt-labor organizations: labor groups that organize and mobilize workers without formal union recognition or collective bargaining.

The resolution also references \u201cincentives for compliance.\u201d Mark Brenner, who directs the media and organizing group Labor Notes, argued there\u2019s much more the AFL-CIO could do if it were willing to \u201cruffle some feathers.\u201d Charging that top leaders of some national unions aren\u2019t interested in engaging or empowering their members, Brenner said a key question for the federation is, \u201cAre you going to break with a hundred years of history and decorum and start organizing around your affiliates?\u201d \u201cIt would be progress on its own,\u201d he said, \u201cif you could find the AFL-CIO drawing locals of various affiliates into projects that they\u2019re doing that aren\u2019t necessarily whole-heartedly embraced by their internationals.\u201d The AFL-CIO\u2019s Becker offered a new multi-union effort at workplace and political transformation in Texas as an example of the role the federation can play in organizing: \u201cThrough the convention and beyond, the task is to put the facts on the table, to put people in a room, such that a discussion can be had that leads people to a conclusion that you know, we can\u2019t keep going it alone in this highly fragmented way.\u201d Lacking \u201ccentralized power\u201d over affiliate unions, said Becker, the federation instead needs to \u201ccreate a discussion which facilitates a conclusion that we have to work together in a systematic way in places that make sense.\u201d Becker also cited the United Auto Workers\u2019 organizing in the South, CWA\u2019s campaign at T-Mobile, the United Food & Commercial Workers-backed effort at Walmart, and Service Employees International Union-backed strikes against fast food corporations as examples of labor exploring and experimenting with \u201chow can we move into the areas we need to move and be effective?\u201d (UAW, CWA, and\u2014since its return to the federation last month\u2014UFCW are all AFL-CIO affiliates; while SEIU is not, the AFL-CIO and some of its affiliates have played roles in supporting the fast food strikers.) He added, \u201cIt\u2019s exactly what we have to do.\u201d The convention could also see discussion of the AFL-CIO\u2019s role in discouraging \u201craids\u201d\u2014a term for efforts by one union to organize members or industries claimed by another. The International Association of Machinists introduced three proposed constitutional amendments all designed to push the AFL-CIO to more aggressively defend AFL-CIO unions from raids, while the International Union of Police Associations submitted a resolution branding the Services Employees International Union (which left the AFL-CIO in 2005) a \u201cpariah organization,\u201d and calling for some SEIU locals to be kicked out of local labor councils for raiding. (The International Longshore and Warehouse Union recently announced it was departing the AFL-CIO in large part over allegedly insufficient support against raiding by other AFL-CIO unions.) Interfaith Worker Justice founder Kim Bobo, who served on the pre-convention Committee on Community Partnerships and Grassroots Power, told The Nation she sees four key roles for the federation: a \u201cbully pulpit\u201d in representing labor\u2019s perspective in public debates; a \u201cconvening role\u201d in bringing unions together to discuss priorities, values, and shared projects; a \u201csanctioning\u201d role in discouraging raiding; and \u201cthe potential to really drive forward some new directions by investing in promising areas.\u201d Noting a recent rise in experimental efforts like the fast food strikes, Bobo said, \u201cI think we need to do just a bunch of them in different ways\u201d and then \u201csee what\u2019s working.\u201d Labor Notes director Brenner, a frequent critic of national union leaders, said he believes their existential crisis has increased major unions\u2019 openness to new strategies and allies. Whereas fifteen years ago \u201cyou wouldn\u2019t see institutions like unions eager to take the lead from someone other than themselves,\u201d he argued, now \u201cpeople are a little more comfortable with discomfort than they used to be.\u201d", "generator": "WooCommerce 2.3.13", "og": {"site_name": "The Nation", "description": "Tomorrow the AFL-CIO will kick off its quadrennial convention, a four-day Los Angeles gathering intended to shape the course of the country\u2019s largest labor federation for the next four years. The convention follows months of meetings by pre-convention committees of labor leaders, allies and academics, and dozens of listening sessions across the country, all aimed at seeking solutions to organized labor\u2019s widely acknowledged crisis. Delegates from the AFL-CIO\u2019s fifty-seven affiliated unions will hear from labor and liberal leaders (including Senator Elizabeth Warren and US Secretary of Labor Tom Perez), elect top officers to lead the federation (current President Richard Trumka and his slate are expected to win uncontested) and vote on resolutions and constitutional amendments regarding the federation\u2019s programs and priorities. I\u2019ll be covering the convention from LA over the next four days. Here\u2014based on conversations with a dozen insiders and outsiders\u2014are a few key themes to watch. Non-Labor Allies and Alt-Labor Much of mainstream media coverage of the AFL-CIO\u2019s pre-convention process has focused on the federation\u2019s talks with other progressive organizations about deepening their relationship, perhaps including a formal role for groups like the NAACP or Sierra Club in the AFL-CIO\u2019s decision-making process. The Wall Street Journal\u2019s Kris Maher reported August 29 that \u201cPushback from member unions\u201d led the federation to \u201cscale back\u201d the proposal; AFL-CIO chief of staff Jon Hiatt told Maher that a governance role was never the plan. The New York Times\u2019s Steven Greenhouse reported Saturday that Trumka wanted to \u201clet millions of nonunion workers\u2014and perhaps environmental, immigrant and other advocacy groups\u2014join the labor federation\u201d and would ask convention delegates for \u201ca green light to pursue these ambitious reforms.\u201d In an August interview with The Nation, AFL-CIO General Counsel Craig Becker acknowledged \u201creasonable concerns\u201d about offering decision-making power to groups that take corporate contributions, and said it \u201cat some fundamental level is clearly true\u201d that dues-paying union members \u201cshould control our organization.\u201d Still, he said, \u201cif we want to serve our members, you have to have some more deep and continuing relationship with your allies.\u201d In an apparent sign of skepticism, the AFL-CIO\u2019s Building and Construction Trades Department and the International Union of Operating Engineers introduced a proposed constitutional amendment under which some AFL-CIO decision-making votes could be restricted to \u201cthe members of the Executive Committee whose members\u2019 employment opportunities and jobs are directly affected,\u201d on the grounds that \u201cit is unfair to the affiliates and their membership whose employment opportunities are directly impacted\u2026to have others with no direct jobs impact to impose their views that may be based, in part, on alliances with non-labor organizations.\u201d BCTD President Sean McGarvey told Maher that Sierra Club efforts to discourage AFL-CIO support for the Keystone XL pipeline \u201cjust highlighted the audacity of people in the radical environmental movement trying to influence the policy of the labor movement.\u201d Meanwhile, since the AFL-CIO\u2019s 2009 convention, major unions, big business and mainstream media have all been paying greater attention to the rise of alt-labor organizations: labor groups that organize and mobilize workers without formal union recognition or collective bargaining. The AFL-CIO has signed partnership agreements with two such groups, the National Day Labor Organizing Network and the National Domestic Workers Alliance; has issued a formal charter to another such group, the New York Taxi Workers Alliance, as an AFL-CIO affiliate; and recently announced a major expansion of its own top alt-labor experiment: Working America, an affiliate for non-union workers which is expanding to all fifty states and taking up workplace organizing. \u201cThe alt-labor stuff has been huge in the whole conversation,\u201d one participant in an AFL-CIO pre-convention committees told The Nation. In the past, he said, the conversation around expanding the labor movement beyond union membership was limited to \u201cCan people who aren\u2019t currently in a union get a credit card that says AFL-CIO on it?\u201d Becker told The Nation that he hopes the AFL-CIO will pursue \u201csome limited, thoughtful experiments\u201d backing additional alt-labor efforts. Unions already provide\u2014along with foundations\u2014a substantial portion of the funding for many such organizations. Trumka told The Nation in April that while collective bargaining remains \u201cone of the best ways\u201d to \u201cactually bring down inequality,\u201d \u201cthere are other tools that we will experiment with.\u201d Alt-labor will also be on display when the AFL-CIO presents its George Meany\u2014Lane Kirkland Human Rights Award to the International Domestic Workers\u2019 Network, which in 2011 scored a major victory with the passage of a landmark new International Labor Organization convention on the right of domestic workers, who do cleaning and caring work in the home. Such workers are among the growing portion of the US workforce that\u2019s implicitly or explicitly excluded from the legal collective bargaining rights established under the New Deal. Politics A transformation of those New Deal labor laws is among the priorities set forth in convention resolutions filed by the federation\u2019s decision-making body. A resolution from the AFL-CIO Executive Committee and one of its pre-convention committees a pledges a \u201cmultiyear\u201d campaign for labor law reforms that would echo the three key planks of the failed Employee Free Choice Act, and also go much further: extending collective bargaining rights to many currently excluded workers; guaranteeing organizers the right to visit the workplace and workers the right not to attend anti-union lectures; allowing states to pass more sweeping pro-labor laws or barring them from passing \u201cright to work\u201d; and addressing the \u201cwho\u2019s the boss?\u201d problem facing increasing numbers of workers by ensuring \u201cthat the entity that holds the real authority over workers\u2019 terms and conditions of employment, even if it is not the workers\u2019 direct employer, comes to the table in bargaining.\u201d The Executive Council has also backed resolutions supporting Dodd-Frank implementation, progressive bankruptcy reforms, immigration reform, voting rights, campaign finance reform, and filibuster reform, and a resolution decrying that \u201cour nation\u2019s profit-driven justice system is producing a level of mass incarceration that is anything but just.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s foolhardy to focus on economic justice and not democracy\u201d as well, Communications Workers of America President Larry Cohen told The Nation this summer. \u201cThat\u2019s impossible. You\u2019ll get crumbs as a result.\u201d UC Berkeley Labor Specialist Steven Pitts, who founded the National Black Worker Center Project and served on one of the AFL-CIO\u2019s pre-convention committes, told The Nation he was \u201csuper-excited\u201d about the mass incarceration resolution, comparing its potential impact to the AFL-CIO\u2019s leftward shift over a decade ago on immigrant rights. Still, he said, \u201cthe real question is, are there are any sort of legs behind the resolution?\u201d In contrast to some unions\u2019 call for a broad progressive political agenda, the AFL-CIO\u2019s Building and Construction Trades Division has introduced a resolution committing the federation to take \u201ca pragmatic, bipartisan approach\u201d to political work, \u201cthat focuses primarily on candidates\u2019 position on issues of direct importance to workers,\u201d and, in congressional districts favorable Republicans, to \u201cencourage moderate candidates who support fairness and equality for workers\u2026\u201d One issue that may go unaddressed at this week\u2019s convention is President Obama\u2019s call for missile strikes in Syria, which may come before the full US Senate on Wednesday (the Syria situation led the president to cancel a planned AFL-CIO convention address). While the AFL-CIO is monitoring the situation, it has taken no position, and no convention resolutions on the issue have been introduced. Gene Bruskin, who served as secretary-treasurer of the AFL-CIO\u2019s Food and Allied Service Trades department and a decade ago helped found US Labor Against the War, said the federation\u2019s silence on the issue demonstrates how it \u201cessentially becomes the advocate for the lowest common dominator approach to things, and that ends up being a killer.\u201d Three local AFL-CIO bodies have introduced resolutions urging cuts in Pentagon spending and withdrawl from Afghanistan by the end of this year. One has introduced a resolution which would end the AFL-CIO\u2019s qualified support for the \u201ce-Verify\u201d program used to check employees\u2019 immigration status, and would urge immigration reform that is \u201cnot contingent upon border security measures.\u201d The convention also comes as some major unions have been increasingly vocal in calling for changes to the Affordable Care Act\u2019s treatment of union members\u2019 health insurance plans. Those issues are tied to the larger question of the federation\u2019s relationship to President Obama and the Democratic Party. \u201cIt\u2019s very much, very much being discussed\u2026,\u201d said Becker, who served as a member of the National Labor Relations Board in Obama\u2019s first term. \u201cThere is a lot of frustration with the administration, with the failure to get labor law reform at a time when it seemed possible in the House and the Senate.\u201d Becker added that there was \u201calso a recognition that the administration has faced a very difficult situation in Congress, in the House and also in the Senate.\u201d Becker noted the sense that, \u201crather than continue to build up the Democratic Party structure, or a particular candidate\u2019s structure, that you know, we ought to support the candidates who we think will further the interests of working families through our own structure.\u201d Trumka has used similar language in describing changes to the AFL-CIO political program unveiled last year. But Columbia political scientist Dorian Warren, who participated in a pre-convention committee, said a more dramatic shift is needed: \u201cIf you just look at the immigrant rights movement, the LGBT movement, and the labor movement, two of those three have been willing to break with the president and push him hard, and have won shit. I can\u2019t say the same for labor.\u201d Asked if he wants to see a reorientation in how the federation deals with Democrats, United Steelworkers President Leo Gerard said, \u201cWe have a good relationship with the administration. Do we always get things the way we want them? No, but we always get a chance to have our voice heard, which is different from what we get under Republicans.\u201d Gerard, who chairs a pre-convention Committee on Shared Prosperity in the Global Economy, called for a \u201cmuch more aggressive\u201d popular education program to engage non-union and union workers on issues like global trade and healthcare, saying, \u201cI think that that\u2019s going to lead us in a much better direction. And we\u2019ll have to be much more assertive with Democrats who don\u2019t want to participate in that.\u201d What\u2019s a Federation For? The Obama question, in turn, touches on a larger one: What\u2019s the purpose of a national labor federation? The AFL-CIO is, in many senses, more the servant than the master of its fifty-seven affiliated international unions, whose ideology, priorities and effectiveness vary widely. \u201cIt\u2019s a federation,\u201d said CWA\u2019s Cohen. \u201cIt\u2019s not a unified organization.\u201d Some within and outside the AFL-CIO argue that the federation\u2019s emphasis has veered too far into electoral politics and policy, rather than funding, staffing, coordinating, or supporting unionization or collective bargaining fights. Bruskin, who worked for several unions before and after his tenure at the AFL-CIO under then-President John Sweeney, argued that supporting workplace organizing campaigns \u201cdoesn\u2019t seem to be a priority for Rich [Trumka], and it was initially for John [Sweeney], but then he sort of let it go.\u201d Instead of the current approach, said Bruskin, \u201cwhat if we said that next year, we are going to take 10 percent of all the money that we would normally give to the Democratic Party, and use that ten per cent to develop a national movement to organize the unemployed, or to initiate a significant program to begin to organize the South?\u201d Cohen took a different view: \u201cI think it\u2019s wrong to separate organizing work from political work. They have to be joined. And when people separate them\u2014which is mostly what\u2019s done\u2014everything goes wrong.\u201d Cohen told The Nation he hopes the convention will fuel better \u201clinkage between the two,\u201d where \u201cyou have to have workers\u2019 rights in the political work, and you have to have political work in the organizing.\u201d \u201cFor low wage people,\u201d he argued, \u201cthey need to be part of a political movement to have any hope. It\u2019s not going to change on scale anything if they\u2019re not\u2026. But I also think there\u2019s a deeper kind of political organizing that needs to go on that generally is missing right now.\u201d The Committee on Growth, Innovation and Political Action, which Cohen co-chairs, introduced (with the AFL-CIO Executive Council) a resolution that would direct the AFL-CIO to advance organizing through steps including \u201cconvene and coordinate large-scale [organizing] efforts at the requests of affiliates that have made significant commitments on their own\u201d and \u201cdeepen its strategic campaign research capability,\u201d and would also require affiliate unions to submit annual confidential organizing plans to Trumka. The resolution also references \u201cincentives for compliance.\u201d Mark Brenner, who directs the media and organizing group Labor Notes, argued there\u2019s much more the AFL-CIO could do if it were willing to \u201cruffle some feathers.\u201d Charging that top leaders of some national unions aren\u2019t interested in engaging or empowering their members, Brenner said a key question for the federation is, \u201cAre you going to break with a hundred years of history and decorum and start organizing around your affiliates?\u201d \u201cIt would be progress on its own,\u201d he said, \u201cif you could find the AFL-CIO drawing locals of various affiliates into projects that they\u2019re doing that aren\u2019t necessarily whole-heartedly embraced by their internationals.\u201d The AFL-CIO\u2019s Becker offered a new multi-union effort at workplace and political transformation in Texas as an example of the role the federation can play in organizing: \u201cThrough the convention and beyond, the task is to put the facts on the table, to put people in a room, such that a discussion can be had that leads people to a conclusion that you know, we can\u2019t keep going it alone in this highly fragmented way.\u201d Lacking \u201ccentralized power\u201d over affiliate unions, said Becker, the federation instead needs to \u201ccreate a discussion which facilitates a conclusion that we have to work together in a systematic way in places that make sense.\u201d Becker also cited the United Auto Workers\u2019 organizing in the South, CWA\u2019s campaign at T-Mobile, the United Food & Commercial Workers-backed effort at Walmart, and Service Employees International Union-backed strikes against fast food corporations as examples of labor exploring and experimenting with \u201chow can we move into the areas we need to move and be effective?\u201d (UAW, CWA, and\u2014since its return to the federation last month\u2014UFCW are all AFL-CIO affiliates; while SEIU is not, the AFL-CIO and some of its affiliates have played roles in supporting the fast food strikers.)

Gene Bruskin, who served as secretary-treasurer of the AFL-CIO\u2019s Food and Allied Service Trades department and a decade ago helped found US Labor Against the War, said the federation\u2019s silence on the issue demonstrates how it \u201cessentially becomes the advocate for the lowest common dominator approach to things, and that ends up being a killer.\u201d Three local AFL-CIO bodies have introduced resolutions urging cuts in Pentagon spending and withdrawl from Afghanistan by the end of this year. One has introduced a resolution which would end the AFL-CIO\u2019s qualified support for the \u201ce-Verify\u201d program used to check employees\u2019 immigration status, and would urge immigration reform that is \u201cnot contingent upon border security measures.\u201d The convention also comes as some major unions have been increasingly vocal in calling for changes to the Affordable Care Act\u2019s treatment of union members\u2019 health insurance plans. Those issues are tied to the larger question of the federation\u2019s relationship to President Obama and the Democratic Party. \u201cIt\u2019s very much, very much being discussed\u2026,\u201d said Becker, who served as a member of the National Labor Relations Board in Obama\u2019s first term. \u201cThere is a lot of frustration with the administration, with the failure to get labor law reform at a time when it seemed possible in the House and the Senate.\u201d Becker added that there was \u201calso a recognition that the administration has faced a very difficult situation in Congress, in the House and also in the Senate.\u201d Becker noted the sense that, \u201crather than continue to build up the Democratic Party structure, or a particular candidate\u2019s structure, that you know, we ought to support the candidates who we think will further the interests of working families through our own structure.\u201d Trumka has used similar language in describing changes to the AFL-CIO political program unveiled last year. But Columbia political scientist Dorian Warren, who participated in a pre-convention committee, said a more dramatic shift is needed: \u201cIf you just look at the immigrant rights movement, the LGBT movement, and the labor movement, two of those three have been willing to break with the president and push him hard, and have won shit. I can\u2019t say the same for labor.\u201d Asked if he wants to see a reorientation in how the federation deals with Democrats, United Steelworkers President Leo Gerard said, \u201cWe have a good relationship with the administration. Do we always get things the way we want them? No, but we always get a chance to have our voice heard, which is different from what we get under Republicans.\u201d Gerard, who chairs a pre-convention Committee on Shared Prosperity in the Global Economy, called for a \u201cmuch more aggressive\u201d popular education program to engage non-union and union workers on issues like global trade and healthcare, saying, \u201cI think that that\u2019s going to lead us in a much better direction. And we\u2019ll have to be much more assertive with Democrats who don\u2019t want to participate in that.\u201d What\u2019s a Federation For? The Obama question, in turn, touches on a larger one: What\u2019s the purpose of a national labor federation? The AFL-CIO is, in many senses, more the servant than the master of its fifty-seven affiliated international unions, whose ideology, priorities and effectiveness vary widely. \u201cIt\u2019s a federation,\u201d said CWA\u2019s Cohen. \u201cIt\u2019s not a unified organization.\u201d Some within and outside the AFL-CIO argue that the federation\u2019s emphasis has veered too far into electoral politics and policy, rather than funding, staffing, coordinating, or supporting unionization or collective bargaining fights. Bruskin, who worked for several unions before and after his tenure at the AFL-CIO under then-President John Sweeney, argued that supporting workplace organizing campaigns \u201cdoesn\u2019t seem to be a priority for Rich [Trumka], and it was initially for John [Sweeney], but then he sort of let it go.\u201d Instead of the current approach, said Bruskin, \u201cwhat if we said that next year, we are going to take 10 percent of all the money that we would normally give to the Democratic Party, and use that ten per cent to develop a national movement to organize the unemployed, or to initiate a significant program to begin to organize the South?\u201d Cohen took a different view: \u201cI think it\u2019s wrong to separate organizing work from political work. They have to be joined. And when people separate them\u2014which is mostly what\u2019s done\u2014everything goes wrong.\u201d Cohen told The Nation he hopes the convention will fuel better \u201clinkage between the two,\u201d where \u201cyou have to have workers\u2019 rights in the political work, and you have to have political work in the organizing.\u201d \u201cFor low wage people,\u201d he argued, \u201cthey need to be part of a political movement to have any hope. It\u2019s not going to change on scale anything if they\u2019re not\u2026. But I also think there\u2019s a deeper kind of political organizing that needs to go on that generally is missing right now.\u201d The Committee on Growth, Innovation and Political Action, which Cohen co-chairs, introduced (with the AFL-CIO Executive Council) a resolution that would direct the AFL-CIO to advance organizing through steps including \u201cconvene and coordinate large-scale [organizing] efforts at the requests of affiliates that have made significant commitments on their own\u201d and \u201cdeepen its strategic campaign research capability,\u201d and would also require affiliate unions to submit annual confidential organizing plans to Trumka. The resolution also references \u201cincentives for compliance.\u201d Mark Brenner, who directs the media and organizing group Labor Notes, argued there\u2019s much more the AFL-CIO could do if it were willing to \u201cruffle some feathers.\u201d Charging that top leaders of some national unions aren\u2019t interested in engaging or empowering their members, Brenner said a key question for the federation is, \u201cAre you going to break with a hundred years of history and decorum and start organizing around your affiliates?\u201d \u201cIt would be progress on its own,\u201d he said, \u201cif you could find the AFL-CIO drawing locals of various affiliates into projects that they\u2019re doing that aren\u2019t necessarily whole-heartedly embraced by their internationals.\u201d The AFL-CIO\u2019s Becker offered a new multi-union effort at workplace and political transformation in Texas as an example of the role the federation can play in organizing: \u201cThrough the convention and beyond, the task is to put the facts on the table, to put people in a room, such that a discussion can be had that leads people to a conclusion that you know, we can\u2019t keep going it alone in this highly fragmented way.\u201d Lacking \u201ccentralized power\u201d over affiliate unions, said Becker, the federation instead needs to \u201ccreate a discussion which facilitates a conclusion that we have to work together in a systematic way in places that make sense.\u201d Becker also cited the United Auto Workers\u2019 organizing in the South, CWA\u2019s campaign at T-Mobile, the United Food & Commercial Workers-backed effort at Walmart, and Service Employees International Union-backed strikes against fast food corporations as examples of labor exploring and experimenting with \u201chow can we move into the areas we need to move and be effective?\u201d (UAW, CWA, and\u2014since its return to the federation last month\u2014UFCW are all AFL-CIO affiliates; while SEIU is not, the AFL-CIO and some of its affiliates have played roles in supporting the fast food strikers.) He added, \u201cIt\u2019s exactly what we have to do.\u201d The convention could also see discussion of the AFL-CIO\u2019s role in discouraging \u201craids\u201d\u2014a term for efforts by one union to organize members or industries claimed by another. The International Association of Machinists introduced three proposed constitutional amendments all designed to push the AFL-CIO to more aggressively defend AFL-CIO unions from raids, while the International Union of Police Associations submitted a resolution branding the Services Employees International Union (which left the AFL-CIO in 2005) a \u201cpariah organization,\u201d and calling for some SEIU locals to be kicked out of local labor councils for raiding. (The International Longshore and Warehouse Union recently announced it was departing the AFL-CIO in large part over allegedly insufficient support against raiding by other AFL-CIO unions.) Interfaith Worker Justice founder Kim Bobo, who served on the pre-convention Committee on Community Partnerships and Grassroots Power, told The Nation she sees four key roles for the federation: a \u201cbully pulpit\u201d in representing labor\u2019s perspective in public debates; a \u201cconvening role\u201d in bringing unions together to discuss priorities, values, and shared projects; a \u201csanctioning\u201d role in discouraging raiding; and \u201cthe potential to really drive forward some new directions by investing in promising areas.\u201d Noting a recent rise in experimental efforts like the fast food strikes, Bobo said, \u201cI think we need to do just a bunch of them in different ways\u201d and then \u201csee what\u2019s working.\u201d Labor Notes director Brenner, a frequent critic of national union leaders, said he believes their existential crisis has increased major unions\u2019 openness to new strategies and allies. Whereas fifteen years ago \u201cyou wouldn\u2019t see institutions like unions eager to take the lead from someone other than themselves,\u201d he argued, now \u201cpeople are a little more comfortable with discomfort than they used to be.\u201d", "title": "Partnerships, Politics and Purpose: Key Questions to Watch at the AFL-CIO Convention", "url": "http://www.thenation.com/article/partnerships-politics-and-purpose-key-questions-watch-afl-cio-convention/", "image": "http://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/d-logo-header.png", "site": "@TheNation", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "September 7th, 2013", "sailthru.title": "Partnerships, Politics and Purpose: Key Questions to Watch at the AFL-CIO Convention", "keywords": "blog, economic policy, government, labor organizing", "fb": {"app_id": 192399944158735}, "sailthru.content_id": 108171, "sailthru.tags": "Economic Policy,Government,Labor Organizing,Blog", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheNationMagazine", "tag": "labor organizing", "published_time": "2013-09-07T15:59:18+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-29T05:51:25+00:00", "author": "http://www.thenation.com/author/"}, "sailthru.description": "The nation\u2019s largest labor federation will meet in Los Angeles to consider resolutions on issues ranging from its relationship to its member unions, to its relationship to the Democratic Party.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "The Obama question, in turn, touches on a larger one: What\u2019s the purpose of a national labor federation?\n(The International Longshore and Warehouse Union recently announced it was departing the AFL-CIO in large part over allegedly insufficient support against raiding by other AFL-CIO unions.)\n\u201cThe alt-labor stuff has been huge in the whole conversation,\u201d one participant in an AFL-CIO pre-convention committees told The Nation.\nWhile the AFL-CIO is monitoring the situation, it has taken no position, and no convention resolutions on the issue have been introduced.\nAd PolicyPoliticsA transformation of those New Deal labor laws is among the priorities set forth in convention resolutions filed by the federation\u2019s decision-making body."}
