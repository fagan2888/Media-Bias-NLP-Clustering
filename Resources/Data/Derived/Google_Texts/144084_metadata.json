In the 1970s hundreds of millions of people will starve to death in spite of any crash programs embarked upon now. At this late date nothing can prevent a substantial increase in the world death rate.\"\n\nEhrlich went on to predict four billion deaths, including 65 million Americans. Didn't happen. The Times rehearses some of Ehrlich's failed predictions:\n\nHis 1968 book, \u201cThe Population Bomb,\u201d sold in the millions with a jeremiad that humankind stood on the brink of apocalypse because there were simply too many of us. Dr. Ehrlich\u2019s opening statement was the verbal equivalent of a punch to the gut: \u201cThe battle to feed all of humanity is over.\u201d He later went on to forecast that hundreds of millions would starve to death in the 1970s, that 65 million of them would be Americans, that crowded India was essentially doomed, that odds were fair \u201cEngland will not exist in the year 2000.\u201d Dr. Ehrlich was so sure of himself that he warned in 1970 that \u201csometime in the next 15 years, the end will come.\u201d By \u201cthe end,\u201d he meant \u201can utter breakdown of the capacity of the planet to support humanity.\u201d As you may have noticed, England is still with us. So is India. Hundreds of millions did not die of starvation in the \u201970s.\n\nAnd yet in the Times, Ehrlich, even now continues to insist:\n\nAfter the passage of 47 years, Dr. Ehrlich offers little in the way of a mea culpa. Quite the contrary. Timetables for disaster like those he once offered have no significance, he told Retro Report, because to someone in his field they mean something \u201cvery, very different\u201d from what they do to the average person. The end is still nigh, he asserted, and he stood unflinchingly by his 1960s insistence that population control was required, preferably through voluntary methods. But if need be, he said, he would endorse \u201cvarious forms of coercion\u201d like eliminating \u201ctax benefits for having additional children.\u201d Allowing women to have as many babies as they wanted, he said, is akin to letting everyone \u201cthrow as much of their garbage into their neighbor\u2019s backyard as they want.\u201d ... Dr. Ehrlich, now 83, is not retreating from his bleak prophesies. He would not echo everything that he once wrote, he says. But his intention back then was to raise awareness of a menacing situation, he says, and he accomplished that. He remains convinced that doom lurks around the corner, not some distant prospect for the year 2525 and beyond. What he wrote in the 1960s was comparatively mild, he suggested, telling Retro Report: \u201cMy language would be even more apocalyptic today.\u201d\n\nShameless self promotion: My new book The End Of Doom: Environmental Renewal in the Twenty-First Century (July 21) explains in the first chapter why Ehrlich failed and how world population is set to peak later in this century and then begin to decline. You can pre-order the book now.
