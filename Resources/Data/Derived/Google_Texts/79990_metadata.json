Duncan has repeatedly reaffirmed that the standards, sanctioned in 45 states and now being implemented across the country, are more difficult than current standards followed by schools across the nation. Some states are reconsidering whether to use Common Core.\n\nEven Common Core supporter Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, expressed concern, comparing the educational initiative\u2019s implementation to another particularly troubled rollout, according to The Post.\n\n\u201cYou think the Obamacare implementation is bad?\u201d Weingarten told The Post. \u201cThe implementation of the Common Core is worse.\u201d\n\nDuncan has expressed frustrations before at the pushback Common Core is getting. At a National Press Club meeting on Sept. 30, he said opposition to the standards was \u201cfueled by political silliness.\u201d Then in June, he explained to a pack of newspaper editors that Common Core naysayers were \u201cmisinformed at best and laboring under paranoid delusions at worst. According to the Post, Duncan took a dislike to a New York Times op-ed that called the Common Core \u201ca radical curriculum,\u201d saying:\n\n\u201cIt is neither radical nor a curriculum. When the critics can\u2019t persuade you that the Common Core is a curriculum, they make even more outlandish claims. They say that the Common Core calls for federal collection of student data. For the record, it doesn\u2019t, we\u2019re not allowed to, and we won\u2019t. And let\u2019s not even get into the really wacky stuff: mind control, robots, and biometric brain mapping.\u201d\n\nGiven the Obamacare lies, Americans are naturally suspicious of Common Core\u2019s hidden components. Duncan\u2019s comments about \u201cwhite-suburban housewives\u201d can best be described in the bureaucrat\u2019s own words: \u201cpolitical silliness.\u201d They\u2019re also offensive.\n\nThe comments had Twitter abuzz. Here is a sampling of the reactions various Politico reporters on hand for the event tweeted:\n\n.@arneduncan says foes of Common Core = white suburban moms who find their \u201cchild isn\u2019t as brilliant as they thought\u201d & \u201cthat\u2019s pretty scary \u2014 Stephanie Simon (@StephanieSimon_) November 15, 2013\n\nDuncan: Biggest threat to Common Core is \u201cwe lose the hearts and minds of those in the middle.\u201d \u2014 Libby Nelson (@libbyanelson) November 15, 2013\n\n\n\nOthers were even less understanding, including writer Jose Vilson.\n\nFirst They Came For Urban Black and Latino Moms (For Arne Duncan) http://t.co/Y4Zml7gBci \u2014 Jose Vilson (@TheJLV) November 17, 2013\n\n@JammieWF @BeanfromPa Racism is racism, wherever you find it.
