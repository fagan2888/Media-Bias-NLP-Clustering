Dean Schillinger is a primary care physician at San Francisco General Hospital. He first came to the city in 1990 at the peak of the AIDS epidemic.

“At that point, one out of every two patients we admitted was a young man dying of AIDS,” he says.

Today, that same ward is filled with diabetes patients.

“I feel like we are with diabetes where we were in 1990 with the AIDS epidemic,” Schillinger said. “The ward is overwhelmed with diabetes — they’re getting their limbs amputated, they’re on dialysis. And these are young people. They are suffering the ravages of diabetes in the prime of their lives. We’re at the point where we need a public health response to it.”

Schillinger and other researchers at the University of California at San Francisco are setting up a project called Sugar Science, to spell out the health dangers of too much added sugar in our diets.

There’s a reason the word “science” is part of the project’s name.

The UCSF team distilled 8,000 studies and research papers and found strong evidence that the consumption of too much added sugar overloads vital organs and contributes not just to Type 2 diabetes but also to heart disease and liver disease.

Laura Schmidt, a professor of health policy at UCSF’s medical school, is also part of the Sugar Science team.

“Right now, the reality is that our consumption of sugar is out of whack,” she says. “The only major change in the diet that explains the obesity epidemic is this steep rise in added sugar consumption that started in the 1980s,” she says.

That sugar isn’t just making us fat, she says, “it’s making us sick.”
