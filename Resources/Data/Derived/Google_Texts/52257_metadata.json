The three-judge panel rejected their argument that they have the same constitutional rights and standing as biological parents, and ruled that the application of the \u201cexisting Indian family exception\u201d did not apply in the case of Children and Family Services v. J.E., et al.\n\nRELATED: Broken: Choctaw Father in California Thwarted in Custody Battle With Foster Couple\n\nFoster parents Summer and Russell Page sought permanent custody of a Choctaw child, known as \u201cBaby A,\u201d after the birth father gave up his reunification efforts and asked that the child be placed with his relatives in Utah under the \u201cpreferred placement\u201d section of the Indian Child Welfare Act. The court struck down all constitutional claims by the Pages, as well as their argument that the \u201cexisting Indian family\u201d exception, which requires significant cultural and familial ties with the tribe in determining custody placements, does not apply.\n\nThe court agreed with the foster parents, however, that the lower court erroneously applied a standard of \u201ccertainty\u201d to show Baby A would be harmed by removing her from their care. In reversing and remanding the lower court\u2019s placement order, which would have removed the child to ICWA-compliant relatives in Utah, the case will now go back to trial in California for further review in which a standard of \u201cclear and convincing\u201d evidence and other factors will be considered, including bonding and best interests.\n\nIn ordering a new trial, however, the court also detailed California\u2019s long legal and legislative history with ICWA and affirmed unequivocally that the burden of proof that there is a \u201cclear and convincing\u201d reason to stray from ICWA will fall on the foster parents.\n\nWriting for the panel, Judge Sandy R. Kriegler confirmed that the child meets the federal definition of an Indian child, while rejecting the plaintiffs\u2019 contention that the Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma had \u201cwaived\u201d its consent to placement preferences by permitting the temporary placement with the Pages.\n\n\u201cThis decision is doing two things at once,\u201d says Barbara Atwood, the Mary Anne Richey Professor of Law Emerita and Director of the Family and Juvenile Law Certificate Program at the University of Arizona James E. Rogers College of Law. \u201cIt rejects the \u2018Existing Indian Family\u2019 exception (EIF) argument, upon which the California courts have been split. This decision provides an important precedent clear path because this exception came out of a Kansas case and it does not appear anywhere in ICWA. So the national trend is leaning toward rejecting EIF. Secondly, it also rejects the constitutional issues raised by the foster couple, at least in dicta, which is huge.\u201d\n\nBaby A was born in November 2009, and has been in state custody for years; the Pages are the child\u2019s third foster home. The child\u2019s non-Indian biological mother, who has a history of drug use and had lost custody of six other children, disappeared soon after giving birth to Baby A, according to court documents. Baby A\u2019s father, who also has a history of drug use and a criminal record, took sole responsibility for raising the newborn, but he was arrested in 2010 for grand theft auto and selling stolen car parts. After he was released from jail on December 31, 2011, he embarked on an unsuccessful, 18-month quest to reunify with his child.\n\nIn July 2012, after a year and a half of trying to regain custody of Baby A, he became depressed, anxious and frustrated over what he considered the ongoing and unnecessary \u201cstalling\u201d by the State of California. After reluctantly terminating his reunification plan, his only request was that his child be placed with ICWA-compliant relatives in Utah so that he could maintain some kind of relationship with the child, although his parental rights and standing in the case remain in tact. By that time, the Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma had intervened to support the father\u2019s placement choice, as had both the child\u2019s attorney and its guardian ad litem, both of whom were appointed by the court to protect the child\u2019s best interests.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Second District Court of Appeals in California unanimously ruled against a non-Native foster couple seeking to adopt a Choctaw child.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/08/20/california-appeals-court-upholds-icwa-choctaw-foster-case-156494", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/article_media/ronald_reagan_state_building_in_los_angeles_california.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "California Appeals Court Upholds ICWA in Choctaw Foster Case"}, "robots": "follow, index", "dc": {"title": "California Appeals Court Upholds ICWA in Choctaw Foster Case"}, "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/08/20/california-appeals-court-upholds-icwa-choctaw-foster-case-156494", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.creator": "kpolisse", "dcterms.date": "2014-08-20T11:12-04:00", "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Indian Child Welfare Act, ICWA, Choctaw Nation, Children and Family Services v.
