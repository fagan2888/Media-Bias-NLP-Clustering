PORTSMOUTH, N.H. — A Kentucky man on a mission across the country to leave large tips at restaurants in the name of his late brother made one local waitress’ day after deciding to make her the latest beneficiary of his goodwill effort.

Seth Collins, 34, of Lexington, Ky., on Wednesday handed a $500 tip to waitress Taylor Dube after dining at The Portsmouth Gas Light Co. Pizza Pub on Market Street. Collins is handing out the tips in honor of his brother, Aaron, who died in July 2012 at age 30.

Dube, 23, of Dover, said she had first heard about Collins’ nationwide giving campaign the night before he entered the pizza pub.

“A couple had told me about it the night before, and I remember thinking, ‘Oh he’ll probably never come in here,'” Dube said.

Lo and behold, the very next day, Dube became the 83rd recipient of Collins’ acts of kindness.

Collins on Monday gave $500 to a waitress at Flatbread Co. in Portland.
