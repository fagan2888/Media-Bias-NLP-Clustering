John is thin and sits in blue pajama pants in the wheelchair he uses to get around.\n\nHe may, however, have overstated his memory problems.\n\n[Also: Baptist Health sees big payoff using predictive analytics]\n\n\u201cWe went to Harding \u2026 that\u2019s the school right up here,\u201d he says. It was 1952, and that\u2019s where he saw the woman who would become his wife \u2014 \u201cthis girl, in this long red sweater, and her red hair. And I said, \u2018That\u2019s the girl for me,\u2019 \u201d he says of Carol Iovine.\n\n\u201cI came out on top,\u201d he says, laughing.\n\nCarol, who is sitting next to her husband, explains that John\u2019s stroke came in the middle of a bad run of health. First, he developed an ulcer, she says. Then he needed an abdominal surgery. After that came the stroke \u2014 and more.\n\n\u201cHe had pneumonia, jaundice, sepsis; clot in the right lung,\u201d she adds. All of that hit between October 2013 and January 2014.\n\nJohn, a former house painter, spent 79 days in the hospital \u2014 some of that unconscious, and nearly all of it stuck in a bed.\n\n\u201cAw, man \u2014 it was hell,\u201d he says.\n\nSink or Swim\n\nJohn Iovine finally went home in April 2014, after several months in a rehab facility.\n\nAnd this point in patients\u2019 recovery \u2014 when they\u2019ve been discharged and have to sink or swim on their own \u2014 is the stage that everyone in the health system is paying special attention to right now. For too long, too many people like John Iovine would take a dive at this stage and end up back in the hospital again.\n\n[Also: Predictive analytics can help solve hospital problems, CFOs say]\n\nThe industry calls these returns to the hospital preventable readmissions, and they are a huge drain on finances, costing Medicare alone $15 billion annually. That\u2019s why Medicare launched an initiative a few years ago that penalizes hospitals that see too many patients readmitted too soon. And in turn, that spurred many hospitals to pay more attention to the problem.\n\nNow insurance companies are also taking a stab at a solution.\n\n\u201cWe are trying to identify which patients are likely to be hospitalized in the next three months \u2014 so that\u2019s our target,\u201d says Somesh Nigam. He\u2019s the chief informatics officer for Independence Blue Cross, a Philadelphia-based insurance firm.\n\nIndependence Blue Cross, he says, is working to identify all those among its customers who are sick or frail enough to be on the edge of hospitalization.\n\nTo do so, the company runs algorithms on the huge amounts of health data at its disposal: billing claims, lab readings, medications, height, weight and family history. It also throws in information about the client\u2019s neighborhood, including poverty rates.\n\n\u201cThe health care data we provided to build these algorithms is equivalent, I think, to [all the data in] five Wikipedias,\u201d says Nigam.\n\nThe computer algorithm sifts through all that information and pops out a score for each individual patient, identifying those it deems at highest risk.\n\nIndependence Blue Cross then assigns each high scorer a staff member \u2014 what it calls a \u201chealth coach,\u201d who will work at no charge to the client to see what extra services may be helpful.\n\n\u201cThis coordinated effort then works for the patient,\u201d Nigam says. The coach may assemble health information tailored to the patient\u2019s needs; make medical appointments; resolve medication issues, or maybe help arrange transportation to the doctor\u2019s office. Sometimes the coach helps arrange for a home care nurse.\n\n\u201cAnd all of that,\u201d Nigam says, \u201cis beginning to show a pretty significant drop in hospitalization rates in our region.\u201d\n\nIndependence Blue Cross has identified 18,000 clients for this sort of extra attention and, as just one sign of success, has already seen a 40 to 50 percent reduction in expected hospital admission rates for people with congestive heart failure.\n\nEarly successes include the Iovines.\n\nLife Changing\n\nCarol Iovine\u2019s life changed, too, after her husband\u2019s stroke: She\u2019s having to manage his new medications, and she helps John shower and get to the toilet. They need to hire a wheelchair-accessible van for each appointment and therapy session, and there are many.\n\nShe says having the support of John\u2019s health coach has made a big difference in helping her manage her husband\u2019s needs.\n\n\u201cHe was supposed to get blood work, and they wanted me to take him to the ER to get blood work,\u201d Carol remembers. \u201d \u2018Uh-uh,\u2019 I said. \u2018No way.\u2019 \u201d\n\nShe called their health coach Donna Crockett, and told her the problem. \u201cAnd the next thing,\u201d Carol Iovine says, \u201ca nurse was here taking blood.\u201d\n\nBig picture: The money the health insurance plan spends on having Crockett arrange a visiting nurse, or streamline appointments is nothing compared to the cost of a hospital admission.\n\nWriting the Rules\n\nThat promise of savings has a lot of health care specialists taking a harder look at the useful potential \u2014 and possible drawbacks \u2014 of these predictive computer formulas.\n\n\u201cThere is a lot of interest in the area right now,\u201d says Glenn Cohen, a professor at Harvard\u2019s law school, who has written about the legal and ethical concerns raised by the collision of health care and big data. \u201cIt is a great coming together of the health care world and the computer science world, as well as the patient experience world.\u201d\n\nStill, he has some qualms.\n\n\u201cThere are questions of whether people whose data is going to be used to build the engine have the right to opt out,\u201d Cohen says. \u201cDo they have to affirmatively opt in? Do they have to even be notified it\u2019s being used?\u201d These are still gray areas, he says.\n\nThe field is so new it doesn\u2019t yet have established standards for how this information should be handled, Cohen says.\n\nIndependence Blue Cross says it follows federal health privacy guidelines regarding anonymity, and is only using the information to better serve its members. But it doesn\u2019t ask the clients who subscribe to its health plans if they want to opt in.\n\n\u201cThe data is only used to improve or coordinate care,\u201d Nigam says. \u201cAnd that is something that you would agree is our role.\u201d\n\nLike Healthcare Finance on Facebook\n\nHealth-wise, coordinated care seems to have made all the difference for John Iovine. He hasn\u2019t been hospitalized in the year since Independence Blue Cross assigned him a health coach.\n\nThe insurer says the early results from its hospitalization efforts are so promising that the company is expanding its efforts. The firm is partnering with New York University\u2019s Langone Medical Center on a next target \u2014 Type 2 diabetes. The goal is to spot those most at risk of getting diabetes before they start showing symptoms \u2014 and then intervene, in hopes of preventing the illness.\n\nThis story is part of a partnership that includes WHYY, NPR and Kaiser Health News.\n\nKaiser Health News is a national health policy news service.
