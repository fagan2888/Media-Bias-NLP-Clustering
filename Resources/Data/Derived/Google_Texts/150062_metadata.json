Amazing. \u2014 Marc J. Spears (@SpearsNBAYahoo) February 25, 2016\n\nThe Brooklyn Nets and guard Joe Johnson have agreed on a buyout, and according to ESPN, the Oklahoma City Thunder are among the list of teams who\u2019re already pursuing the 34-year-old sharp shooter.\n\nAfter originally dodging the idea of being bought out from the final year of his six-year contract, Johnson has reportedly been sold on the idea of joining a contender for the stretch run of the season. The former Arkansas Razorback is averaging 11.8 points per game this season, but holds a 17.0 ppg average throughout his 14-year NBA career.\n\nJohnson would be eligible to sign with another team as long as he\u2019s released by Brooklyn before Tuesday.\n\nAlong with the Thunder, the Cavaliers, Hawks, Celtics, Rockets, Heat and Raptors have also shown interest in acquiring Johnson.\n\nSources tell ESPN several playoff teams (Atlanta, Boston, Cleveland, Houston, Miami, OKC and Toronto) are already in pursuit of Joe Johnson \u2014 Marc Stein (@ESPNSteinLine) February 25, 2016\n\nDespite his long tenured career, it appears Johnson still has something left in the tank. Since the start of the New Year, Johnson\u2019s averaging 13.4 ppg while shooting 46 percent from behind the arc. Along with his shot-making ability, Johnson also bears the \u201cclutch gene\u201d which is so valuable once the playoffs roll around. He has seven game-winning buzzer-beaters in the last ten years, and embraces the idea of knocking down a shot when it matters most.\n\nIt could be a long shot, but Johnson would fit perfectly within the Thunder rotation, and he may be the missing piece OKC needs to make a run at the Warriors. With the inconsistency coming from the shooting guard spot on the Thunder roster, Johnson could solidify himself as a starter from day one and be guaranteed to play big minutes on a contending team. The idea of playing along all-world players such as Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook could also play a role in bolstering Johnson\u2019s interest of signing with OKC.", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-17", "Description": "Joe Johnson and the Nets have begun discussing a buyout from the final year of his contract, and the Thunder are one of the teams already pursuing the sharpshooter, according to reports.", "author": "Brett Coppenbarger", "og": {"url": "http://www.newson6.com/story/31317467/report-nets-negotiating-buyout-with-joe-johnson-thunder-already-in-pursuit", "image": "http://KWTV.images.worldnow.com/images/9968926_G.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Joe Johnson and the Nets have begun discussing a buyout from the final year of his contract, and the Thunder are one of the teams already pursuing the sharpshooter, according to reports.", "title": "Report: Nets Officially Waive Joe Johnson, Thunder Already In Pursuit"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://KWTV.images.worldnow.com/images/9968926_G.jpg", "description": "Joe Johnson and the Nets have begun discussing a buyout from the final year of his contract, and the Thunder are one of the teams already pursuing the sharpshooter, according to reports.", "card": "summary", "title": "Report: Nets Officially Waive Joe Johnson, Thunder Already In Pursuit"}, "wnreadableurl": "report-nets-negotiating-buyout-with-joe-johnson-thunder-already-in-pursuit", "ROBOTS": "index,follow,noarchive", "owner": "KWTV", "fb": {"app_id": 497059410331845}, "date": "2016/02/25", "KEYWORDS": "oklahoma city,okc,media,news,weather,tv,cbs,local,tornado,storm,oklahoma,newsok,thunder,nba,basketball,joe johnson,thunder,buyout,contract,nets,brooklyn,kevin durant,russell westbrook", "wn-version": "ContainerE-Story", "wn-base": "IIS23", "verify-v1": "67+ifqPKEX7ZTB2sopjxTD1c6nx6ScxupNN92EqnIpc=", "news_keywords": "oklahoma city,okc,media,news,weather,tv,cbs,local,tornado,storm,oklahoma,newsok,thunder,nba,basketball,joe johnson,thunder,buyout,contract,nets,brooklyn,kevin durant,russell westbrook"}, "article_summary": "Johnson would be eligible to sign with another team as long as he\u2019s released by Brooklyn before Tuesday.\nThe Warriors can clinch a playoff berth on Feb. 25 with a win tonight at Orlando and a Houston loss.\nAlong with the Thunder, the Cavaliers, Hawks, Celtics, Rockets, Heat and Raptors have also shown interest in acquiring Johnson.\nAlong with his shot-making ability, Johnson also bears the \u201cclutch gene\u201d which is so valuable once the playoffs roll around.\nIt could be a long shot, but Johnson would fit perfectly within the Thunder rotation, and he may be the missing piece OKC needs to make a run at the Warriors."}
