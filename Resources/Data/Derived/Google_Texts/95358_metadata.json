Basketball caused the most injuries, 570,000. Bicycling caused the second most, 557,000, but it has by far the highest injury rate, 126.5 injured per every 100,000 people.\n\nThe most commonly treated sports injuries are sprained or fractured ankles or knees. The report highlights how expensive those injuries are. Sprains cost a 25- to 40-year-old who lacks insurance an average of $3,175. Fractures can cost as much as $7,666 for the uninsured.\n\n\"Play hard, be smart and get covered,\" Battier said.\n\nThe former Duke star, who said he was looking forward to a Tuesday night game in Cleveland, didn't stick around for media questions.\n\ndfriedman@nydailynews.com", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "DAN FRIEDMAN", "twitter": {"description": "The White House is hoping March Madness, and members of the Miami Heat, can help sell young Americans on Obamacare.
