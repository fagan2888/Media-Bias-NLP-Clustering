That false chain email about the \u201cnew\u201d tax increases that aren\u2019t new is circulating again.\n\nThe taxes weren\u2019t new when we wrote about them in 2014 or 2015, and they weren\u2019t \u201call passed under the Affordable Care Act.\u201d It\u2019s also still false that \u201cnot one Republican voted to do these\u201d tax increases.\n\nAs a brief reminder for those who forgot or for many that didn\u2019t know. Here is what happened, quietly, on January 1, 2016: Medicare tax went from 1.45% to 2.35% Top Income tax bracket went from 35% to 39.6% Top Income payroll tax went from 37.4% to 52.2% Capital Gains tax went from 15% to 28% Dividend tax went from 15% to 39.6% Estate tax went from 0% to 55% A 3.5% Real Estate transaction tax was added. Remember these facts: These taxes were all passed solely with Democrat votes. Not a single Republican voted for these new taxes. These taxes were all passed in the Affordable Care Act, aka Obamacare.\n\nOnly two of the taxes in this year\u2019s version were part of the Affordable Care Act, which passed without Republican support, as the email states. Most of the others were part of the so-called fiscal cliff package that passed with bipartisan congressional support in 2012.\n\nThe Medicare tax increase of 0.9 percentage points was in the Affordable Care Act, but it took effect in January 2013. Plus, it applies only to those who earn more than $250,000 for married couples who file jointly, $125,000 for married couples who file separately and $200,000 for all others.\n\nAnd we assume that the claim that \u201ca 3.5% real estate transaction tax was added\u201d this year is an inaccurate reference to the health care law\u2019s 3.8 percent tax on the net investment income of individuals and couples with high incomes. That tax started in 2013. It\u2019s not a simple tax on real estate transactions, though. Even the National Association of Realtors says that \u201c[t]here is neither a real estate \u2018sales tax\u2019 nor a real estate transfer tax under any federal law.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a new year, but this recycled email is just more of the same. Read our original \u201cFalse Tax Claims\u201d article for more details.\n\nCorrection, Feb. 24: This article originally said that the Affordable Care Act included a \u201c0.9 percent Medicare tax increase.\u201d The tax increase was 0.9 percentage points, from 1.45 percent to 2.35 percent.", "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "These taxes were all passed in the Affordable Care Act, aka Obamacare.\nOnly two of the taxes in this year\u2019s version were part of the Affordable Care Act, which passed without Republican support, as the email states.\nHere is what happened, quietly, on January 1, 2016: Medicare tax went from 1.45% to 2.35% Top Income tax bracket went from 35% to 39.6% Top Income payroll tax went from 37.4% to 52.2% Capital Gains tax went from 15% to 28% Dividend tax went from 15% to 39.6% Estate tax went from 0% to 55% A 3.5% Real Estate transaction tax was added.\nThe Medicare tax increase of 0.9 percentage points was in the Affordable Care Act, but it took effect in January 2013.\nRemember these facts: These taxes were all passed solely with Democrat votes."}
