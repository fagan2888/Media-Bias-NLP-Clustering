He notes that while Mr. Trump has a concealed carry permit in New York, he also donated $584,850 to Democrats, the Clinton Global Initiative and Rahm Emanuel\u2019s campaign for Chicago mayor. The candidate also publicly supported a ban on assault weapons at one point.\n\nStill, Mr. Trump\u2019s talk on the campaign trail seems \u201cclear and convincing,\u201d Mr. McHale says.\n\n\u201cOn the plus side, he\u2019s been more specific about exactly how he supports Second Amendment issues than any other candidate. He\u2019s also detailed his position in writing in his platform. Many others will verbally state some nebulous support of gun rights in a speech, but are often reluctant to detail their views, especially in writing. On the flip side, his past positions are a valid reason for concern as he has yet to clarify a believable explanation for his apparent change of position,\u201d Mr. McHale writes.\n\nSEE ALSO: Bill to gut Obamacare, defund Planned Parenthood threatened by warring conservative lobbies\n\n\u201cAs far as the donations go, it\u2019s hard to draw conclusions one way or the other. As a businessman trying to get things done all over the country, it\u2019s far more likely that his donations are a tool to gain support for his various development projects. If you made me choose a position, I\u2019d put candidate Trump in the \u2018gun rights supporter\u2019 column, but clearly Mr. USA has some additional explaining to do,\u201d Mr. McHale concludes.\n\nTHAT PESKY CARBON FOOTPRINT\n\nNo matter how they spin it, the 190 global leaders now gathered in Paris to talk about climate change can\u2019t escape carbon footprints left by their aircraft and ground transportation to the event.\n\nSEE ALSO: Planned Parenthood shootings suspect narrowly avoided SWAT assault with last-minute surrender\n\nThe United Nation\u2019s\u2018 own Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change says that such transport accounts for 23 percent of greenhouse gas emissions, and the percentage is expected to increase. The Swiss-based Air Transport Action Group says the aviation industry alone produces 12 percent.\n\nBut the big shots have to get their some how. Germany\u2019s environmental minister Barbara Hendricks took a train to Paris, rather than fly in, though the journey was still disrupted by \u201canarchists\u201d protesting her mode of travel.\n\n\u201cClimate change alarmists stubbornly refuse to live as if they believe a single word of what they\u2019re saying. The size of their carbon footprints is staggering,\u201d observes John Hayward, a Brietbart columnist. \u201cThese conferences are unnecessary. It\u2019s 2015. We have incredibly advanced telecommuting systems. Climate confabs are an excuse for politicians to soak their taxpayers for luxury junkets to exotic vacation destinations, where they stay in five-star hotels and dine on the finest gourmet foods.\u201d\n\nIndeed, President Obama flew to Paris aboard Air Force One, which costs $206,000 per hour to operate and burns five gallons of jet fuel for every mile it covers, Mr. Hayward says. Since aviation fuel releases 21 pounds of carbon into the atmosphere for every gallon burned, he figures the president\u2019s 7,656-mile round-trip to Paris will consume 38,280 gallons of fuel, and release 803,880 pounds of carbon by the time Mr. Obama returns home Tuesday evening.\n\nAnd the grand total here? Wired.com reporter Nick Stockton estimates that the thousands who travel to the conference are ultimately responsible for the emission of 300,000 tons of carbon dioxide \u2014 based on typical industry standards, and the average travel distances of the participants.\n\nALARMING THE ALARMISTS\n\nThe COP 21 meeting on climate change plods forward, but not without protest. \u201cBrandalism\u201d is at work in Paris. Some 60 artist activists have plastered the town with 600 parody posters that claim the big event is guilty of \u201cgreenwashing\u201d \u2014 accepting auto and airline sponsors who are guilty of polluting the air, but eager to market their virtue before the green-minded crowd.\n\n\u201cDrive cleaner \u2014 or just pretending to?\u201d asks one big graphic targeting Volkswagen.\n\n\u201cThe multinationals responsible for climate change can keep greenwashing their destructive business models, but the communities directly impacted by them are silenced. It\u2019s now more important than ever to call out their lies and speak truth to power,\u201d the British-based art collective advised in a public statement.\n\nSTOP YOUR WHINING AND GET BUSY\n\n\u201cPresident Obama attacked me for not wanting Syrian refugees to enter our country. He doesn\u2019t want you to know that his and Hillary Clinton\u2019s failed tough-talk-but-do-nothing policies are responsible for the meltdown in the Middle East. Millions of families are fleeing their homes because the Obama-Clinton tough talk is just empty rhetoric. We need leaders who will stop whining and start winning.\u201d\n\n\u2014 GOP presidential hopeful Ben Carson in a new campaign video released Monday. The candidate was in Jordan last weekend visiting Syrian refugees to see their problems first-hand.\n\nFOXIFIED\n\nThose consistently high ratings on Fox News aren\u2019t just a random occurrence. Media watchers cite the influence of a single force.\n\nAdWeek has named Fox News chairman and CEO Roger Ailes the \u201cMedia Visionary of the Year,\u201d crediting him with upping the value of the network, now on track to make $2.3 billion in revenue by year\u2019s end. That\u2019s twice as much as CNN is worth. Fox News was also named \u201cHottest Network of the Year\u201d by AdWeek.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t feel any different in my brain than when I was 30 years old,\u201d Mr. Ailes told the publication.\n\nMeanwhile, \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d garnered its highest ratings in a decade last week when close to 2 million viewers tuned in to the show hosted by Chris Wallace, according to Nielsen Media. The program featured a rare TV interview with Rush Limbaugh, plus a session with GOP presidential hopeful Sen. Marco Rubio.\n\nPOLL DU JOUR\n\n\u2022 46 percent of Syrian residents say they would leave their country \u201cif given the opportunity.\u201d\n\n\u2022 43 percent expect to at least leave their current community in the next year.\n\n\u2022 39 percent would prefer to migrate permanently to Europe, 35 percent prefer the Middle East and northern Africa.\n\n\u2022 30 percent prefer to continue living in Syria.\n\n\u2022 10 percent would prefer to live in Asia, 6 percent in North America.\n\nSource: A Gallup poll of 1,002 Syrian adults conducted throughout January and released Monday.\n\n\u2022 Major issues, petty annoyances to jharper@washingtontimes.com.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Is Donald Trump \"really pro-gun?\" asks Tom McHale, author of several consumer gun guides, and a contributor to OudoorHub, a sports news site.
