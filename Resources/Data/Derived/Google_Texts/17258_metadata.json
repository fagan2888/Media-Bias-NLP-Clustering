On the local level, the maneuver amounts to as little as the tacit acknowledgment of a general frustration with the White House over the past eight years; on the state and federal level, including in senate and congressional races, it amounts to full-blown attack on the president and his policies.\n\n\u201cRoy Cho supports Obamacare and its skyrocketing costs. The President lied to us,\u201d reads a recent mailer issued by the Republican incumbent in North Jersey\u2019s fifth congressional district, where Scott Garrett is seeking his 11th term over Democratic hopeful Roy Cho. The mailer, stamped Garrett For Congress, features portraits of Cho and Obama next to the headline, \u201cDemocrat Roy Cho supports President Obama and his policies.\u201d\n\nThe Obama effect, as its come to be called by some political observers and pundits, seems to be getting the most mileage on the national level, in contested House and Senate races where Republicans have made a habit of invoking the president\u2019s name and his much-lambasted tenure to smear their Democratic opponents. In CD5, Garrett has employed it as Cho continues to make inroads, despite demographic and funding advantages that tilt toward the Republican. But the tactic is particularly pertinent in contested Senate races, where the GOP is vying fiercely to wrestle control from a Democratic majority.\n\nIn New Jersey, the state\u2019s own Senate race has become a testament to the trend. Republican hopeful Jeff Bell, the 70-year-old policy wonk facing off against incumbent Senator Cory Booker, has made it a point to call out the Democrat on his perceived loyalty to the nation\u2019s top executive just about every chance he gets. Indeed, it\u2019s become perhaps Bell\u2019s greatest advantage over the more popular Booker, as he lags behind his opponent both in standing and in financing (not to mention, Booker seems to be making easy work of Bell\u2019s other issues, particularly his views on the gold standard).\n\n\u201cRather than just spend his time in New Jersey indoors at a Democratic Party fundraiser, President Obama should join with Cory Booker and engage with voters by the beach while the weather\u2019s still pleasant,\u201d Bell said earlier this month after Obama announced he\u2019d be visiting the state to host a close-door fundraiser with Booker. \u201cI look forward to seeing how voters feel about the president\u2019s job performance and by extension Cory Booker \u2013 who has a record in the U.S. Senate of voting 100% with the Obama agenda. While President Obama may also choose to answer questions from the press while he\u2019s in New Jersey, I would not expect Sen. Booker to start doing that.\u201d\n\nGarrett has also taken to knocking Cho for his proximity to Obama \u2014 even if it is in party name only. Widely considered the most conservative congressman in New Jersey, and one who\u2019s had little difficulty retaining his seat over the last decade, Garrett faces arguably his great challenge yet in Cho, who recent polling shows to be trailing the Republican by a surprisingly narrow margin of five points over the last leg of the race.\n\n\u201cFamilies are losing their doctors and insurance policies, but Roy Cho won\u2019t repeal Obamacare,\u201d Garrett\u2019s mailer, sent to voters in the Warren, Sussex, Passaic, and Bergen County-constituted district earlier this month, reads. \u201cHe\u2019s more concerned with political power grabs than helping New Jersey families. Now Roy Cho wants to represent you in Congress.\u201d\n\nBut while movement conservative Garrett\u2019s quickness to take to Obama-bashing likely isn\u2019t very surprising, other, more moderate conservative congressional candidates in the state see the same opportunity to turn out voters in linking the president to their Democratic counterparts. In South Jersey\u2019s third congressional district, arguably the state\u2019s most competitive race, the GOP is using the same strategy to help get their candidate, Republican businessman Tom MacArthur, elected over his Democratic challenger, Burlington County Freeholder Aimee Belgard.\n\nAccording to a Republican source in the district, the GOP\u2019s strategy in that race is to drive a high turnout by focusing heavy on anti-Obama optics. Led by county GOP Chairman George Gilmore, Republicans see an opportunity particularly in the Ocean County half of the district, where registered Republicans outnumber Democrats 103,517 (28.4%) to 74,795 (20.5%), but where 186,089 (51.0%) independents have a strong history of leaning right. And while Burlington County, though Democratic on paper, also boasts a long history of Republican leadership, Obama\u2019s polling numbers are dismal in Ocean, the most conservative county in the state.\n\nSources say this has led the GOP leadership to focus their efforts in the last weeks of the race on drawing parallels between Belgard, whose strengths lie in healthcare and who has focused heavily on talk about Obamacare and social security and Medicare in the contest, to Obama \u2014 but also between Obama and Booker, whose campaign wants to beat Bell by more than 11 points, the 2013 margin of victory by Booker over movement conservative Steve Lonegan.\n\nGilmore and his team want to push big numbers out of the Ocean County half of CD3 not only to propel MacArthur\u2019s margin of victory, but to chest thump with more abandon over other GOP rivals.\n\nBut while Republicans in New Jersey\u2019s federal elections are explicitly using Obama\u2019s unpopularity to attract voters, conservatives in down-ballot races look to be doing it implicitly \u2014 or, at the very least, find themselves feeding off the effects. In municipal elections across the state, Republican leaders are hoping that Obama fatigue among the general populace will help to give their candidate\u2019s an edge, especially in driving out voters who might not be enticed otherwise to head to the polls on the 4th.\n\n\u201cThe displeasure about Obama, the displeasure with his policies, it only helps us,\u201d said Bob Yudin, the Bergen County Republican chairman whose candidate in the county\u2019s executive race, Republican incumbent Kathe Donovan, is working to keep Democratic opponent and first-term Bergen County Freeholder Jim Tedesco from the door. \u201cHow much it helps us is hard to say because it\u2019s just difficult to pin that down. But it is a factor, and it can only help us, it can\u2019t hurt us.\u201d\n\nYudin said he\u2019s confident this year\u2019s Obama effect will help Republicans \u201cat whatever level of a campaign you\u2019re talking about,\u201d whether it be races at the top of the ticket or at the bottom. He pointed to the president\u2019s performance on the job, public perception, and approval ratings \u2014 which currently sit at near-record lows \u2014 as evidence that Republicans can only benefit from the White House during this year\u2019s election cycle.\n\nStill, it\u2019s unclear how successful Republicans\u2019 strategy will be. In the two starkest examples of conservatives employing the tactic, Republicans Garrett and Bell are doing poorer than expected, with Garrett closest to facing a Democratic upset than he\u2019s ever been and Bell with hopes for any success at all quickly dwindling.\n\nAccording to Ben Dworkin, director of the Rebovich Institute of Politics at Rider University, voter turn out this election will probably have a lot more to with the candidates and their particular records than the president\u2019s popularity.\n\n\u201cFirst of all, this is a tried and true tactic of campaigns,\u201d Dworkin said. \u201cPeople, when Richard Nixon was unpopular, they linked Republicans to him. When George Bush was unpopular, down-ballot Republicans were linked to him. When Bill Clinton was unpopular, when Jim McGreevey was unpopular, they were all linked to them. So this happens.\u201d\n\nDworkin said the strategy has seen \u201ca very mixed record of success \u2014 and I\u2019m not convinced that the current electorate is focused on sending a message to Obama, and therefore ready to punish Democrats in this upcoming November election.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think Republicans are more motivated to come out and vote than Democrats and that might make the difference,\u201d Dworkin added. \u201cBut despite the president\u2019s unpopularity, I don\u2019t sense a ground swell of a \u2018send the president a message by voting Republican\u2019 wave out there. That goes for up and down ballot races.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "https://nyopolitickernj.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/gopobamacollage.jpg?w=50", "description": "Republicans in New Jersey are using a familiar tactic to turn out voters: link them to President Barack Obama.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "New Jersey News, Politics, Opinion, and Analysis", "description": "With just over a week to go before election day, Republicans in New Jersey are using a familiar tactic to turn out voters and damage the names of their Democratic opponents: link them to President \u2026", "title": "Elections 2014: NJ Republicans using Obama fatigue to drum up support", "url": "http://politickernj.com/2014/10/elections-2014-nj-republicans-jump-on-obama-fatigue-to-turn-out-vote/", "image": {"width": 970, "identifier": "https://nyopolitickernj.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/gopobamacollage.jpg", "height": 359}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://nyopolitickernj.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/gopobamacollage.jpg?w=640"}, "site": "@PolitickerNJ", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@PolitickerNJ"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-10-26 22:47:29", "sailthru.title": "Elections 2014: NJ Republicans using Obama fatigue to drum up support", "sailthru.tags": "Aimee Belgard, Barack Obama, Ben Dworkin, Bob Yudin, Congress 2014, Cory Booker, George Gilmore, Jeff Bell, Jim Tedesco, Kathe Donovan, mailers, New Jersey, Obamacare, Roy Cho, Scott Garrett, Senate 2014, Tom MacArthur", "fb": {"app_id": 710865528969413}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://politickernj.com/feed/;icon-uri=https://s2.wp.com/i/favicon.ico", "application-name": "New Jersey News, Politics, Opinion, and Analysis", "keywords": "barack obama, jeff bell, cory booker, scott garrett, roy cho, tom macarthur, aimee belgard, george gilmore, bob yudin, kathe donovan, jim tedesco, ben dworkin, senate 2014, congress 2014, new jersey,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/PolitickerNJ", "published_time": "2014-10-27T02:47:29+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-10-27T04:09:53+00:00", "author": "http://wordpress.com/author/chase-brush"}, "sailthru.description": "With just over a week to go before election day, Republicans in New Jersey are using a familiar tactic to turn out voters and damage the names of their Democratic opponents: link them to President Barack Obama.", "sailthru.image.full": "https://nyopolitickernj.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/gopobamacollage.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=0", "news_keywords": "Barack Obama, Jeff Bell, Cory Booker, Scott Garrett, Roy Cho, Tom MacArthur, Aimee Belgard, George Gilmore, Bob Yudin, Kathe Donovan, Jim Tedesco, Ben Dworkin, Senate 2014, Congress 2014, New Jersey,"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca4a8\"", "article_summary": "In CD5, Garrett has employed it as Cho continues to make inroads, despite demographic and funding advantages that tilt toward the Republican.\nBut the tactic is particularly pertinent in contested Senate races, where the GOP is vying fiercely to wrestle control from a Democratic majority.\nWith just over a week to go before election day, Republicans in New Jersey are using a familiar tactic to turn out voters and damage the names of their Democratic opponents: link them to President Barack Obama.\n\u201cBut despite the president\u2019s unpopularity, I don\u2019t sense a ground swell of a \u2018send the president a message by voting Republican\u2019 wave out there.\nWhen Bill Clinton was unpopular, when Jim McGreevey was unpopular, they were all linked to them."}
