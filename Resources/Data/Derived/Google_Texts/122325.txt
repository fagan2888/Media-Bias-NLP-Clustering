State police say a driver was killed after he was trapped in a car that crashed into a toll plaza on the Atlantic City Expressway and became engulfed in flames.

Lt. Brian Polite said that 39-year-old Joseph Crawford, of Egg Harbor City, died in the accident Friday morning around 10:30 at the Egg Harbor toll plaza.

Polite says part of the toll plaza caught on fire as well, but no toll plaza employees were hurt.

The cash toll lanes are closed and all drivers are going through the E-ZPass express lanes.
