Economists say Puerto Rico captures just over half the tax revenue it should, failing to collect on an estimated $800 million in unreported income each year.\n\nA new plan backed by Gov. Alejandro Garcia aims to boost revenue and tackle the U.S. territory\u2019s spiraling public debt by creating a 16 percent value-added tax, or VAT. If approved, manufacturers would pay the tax on raw materials and include it in the price of the product sold to retailers, who then would pass it on to consumers.\n\nHaving the tax levied and recorded at each stage would make it harder for businesses to evade taxes. It also would replace the island\u2019s current 7 percent sales tax, approved in 2006, that many people avoid through cash transactions.\n\n\u201cWe currently have a tax system that penalizes work and productivity while encouraging evasion,\u201d Garcia said. \u201cIt is inefficient and unfair.\u201d\n\nAdvocates say the VAT would boost revenue collection as Puerto Rico struggles to pay off a $73 billion public debt, which leads to higher interest rates and makes it hard for the government to borrow money. Garcia, who faces re-election next year, is likely to win support from the legislature, where his party holds the majority, despite strong public opposition. The proposal currently is being debated, although some lawmakers including the president of the local House of Representatives, are demanding changes.\n\nGarcia was scheduled to make an announcement Monday about the VAT. His chief of staff dismissed speculation the measure would be withdrawn.\n\nThe VAT system is used widely in the European Union and elsewhere, but not in the United States. Supporters say it helps boost revenue in financially strapped countries with high unemployment and limited income. Puerto Rico, mired in an 8-year recession, has an unemployment rate of 13 percent, more than twice that of the U.S. mainland.\n\nBusiness owners in Puerto Rico, however, say it will be costly to implement and will lead to a drop in consumption.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Struggling Puerto Rico cracks down on tax cheats", "author": "Danica Coto", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Struggling Puerto Rico cracks down on tax cheats", "title": "Struggling Puerto Rico cracks down on tax cheats", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/03/08/struggling_puerto_rico_cracks_down_on_tax_cheats/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/03/puerto-rico-tax-evasion.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Struggling Puerto Rico cracks down on tax cheats", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/03/puerto-rico-tax-evasion.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "title": "Struggling Puerto Rico cracks down on tax cheats", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Struggling Puerto Rico cracks down on tax cheats", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf23c\"", "article_summary": "Economists say Puerto Rico captures just over half the tax revenue it should, failing to collect on an estimated $800 million in unreported income each year.\nTopics: From the Wires, NewsSAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) \u2014 With recession biting into profits at their chain of burger restaurants and surf shops, two brothers responded in a way Puerto Rico authorities say is common: by shortchanging the government.\nPuerto Rico, mired in an 8-year recession, has an unemployment rate of 13 percent, more than twice that of the U.S. mainland.\nBusiness owners in Puerto Rico, however, say it will be costly to implement and will lead to a drop in consumption.\nAlejandro Garcia aims to boost revenue and tackle the U.S. territory\u2019s spiraling public debt by creating a 16 percent value-added tax, or VAT."}
