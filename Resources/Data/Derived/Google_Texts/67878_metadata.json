Some say they lose money by paying the extra labor and operating costs to stay open on Sundays.\n\nIn a 2003 story for The Associated Press, I pointed out:\n\nMore women in the labor force and the softening and repealing of \"blue laws\" across the nation have made Sunday as much a day of activity and commerce as worship and relaxation.\n\nHistorically, Sunday blue laws -- so called because they were written on blue paper -- forbade the sale of items such as cigarettes and alcohol. They also prohibited secular amusements and unnecessary work.\n\n\"With an increasingly large fraction of women with regular business-week employment, the effect of that is to essentially eliminate Monday through Friday as viable options for them doing their shopping,\" said David A. Laband, an Auburn University economist and author of \"Blue Laws: The History, Economics and Politics of Sunday-Closing Laws.\"\n\nSo who does the Star-Telegram quote?\n\nLawmakers? Check.\n\nCar dealers? Check.\n\nLiquor store owners? Check.\n\nChurch folks? Huh? I mean, nope.\n\nGranted, this was a political and business story, so it makes sense that the newspaper included the sources that it did.\n\nAt the same time, the total lack of religious voices haunts the piece. These aren't just holy ghosts. They're blue ghosts.\n\nSeriously, faith leaders' perspectives on this topic would be fascinating: Do they believe Texas should maintain any semblance of a day of rest? Or do the number of cars at youth soccer fields and megaplex theaters \u2014 as opposed to houses of worship \u2014 on Sundays point to a cultural battle already lost?", "article_metadata":
