It occurs when the baby\u2019s blood contains too much bilirubin, a yellow pigment of red blood cells, due to an immature liver.\n\nInfant jaundice often doesn\u2019t need to be treated \u2014 but if it\u2019s severe enough and isn\u2019t treated, it can ultimately lead to complications. Now, a newly-developed smartphone app will assist parents in screening their babies to see if they need a blood test to check bilirubin levels.\n\n\u201cVirtually every baby gets jaundiced, and we\u2019re sending them home from the hospital even before bilirubin levels reach their peak,\u201d said James Taylor, a professor of pediatrics and medical director at the newborn nursery at University of Washington Medical Center. \u201cThis smartphone test is really for babies in the first few days after they go home. A parent or health care provider can get an accurate picture of bilirubin to bridge the gap after leaving the hospital.\u201d\n\nThe app is called BiliCam and uses a smartphone\u2019s camera, flash, and color calibration card. The phone is placed on the infant\u2019s belly, then the parent or doctor can take a picture with the color card in view, thus determining different lighting conditions and skin tones. The app then reports the baby\u2019s bilirubin levels. Though jaundice screening is available in some hospitals, it is usually extremely expensive and can\u2019t be used at home. The app would provide an easy and accurate way for parents to identify jaundice early. \u201cThis is a way to provide peace of mind for the parents of newborns,\u201d Shwetak Patel, an associate professor of computer science and engineering at the University of Washington, said.\n\nIn a recent clinical study, researchers examined BiliCam\u2019s efficacy on 100 newborns, and found that it was just as effective or even better than the current screening tool.\n\n\u201cIn the old days, all we used were our eyes to decide whether a baby should get her or his blood drawn for bilirubin levels,\u201d Taylor said in a UW article. \u201cAnd so our eyes are obviously very subjective to the baby\u2019s skin and the light in the room \u2026 and that really was one of the main problems with visual assessment for jaundice.\u201d\n\nTaylor continued:", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "jaundice, bilicam", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "For parents who want to check for jaundice in their newborn at home, a new smartphone app can be of assistance by identifying blood bilirubin levels.", "title": "This Smartphone App Can Detect Jaundice In Newborn Babies", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/smartphone-app-detects-jaundice-newborn-babies-works-within-minutes-300394", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/28/jaundice.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "For parents who want to check for jaundice in their newborn at home, a new smartphone app can be of assistance by identifying blood bilirubin levels.", "title": "This Smartphone App Can Detect Jaundice In Newborn Babies", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/smartphone-app-detects-jaundice-newborn-babies-works-within-minutes-300394", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/28/jaundice.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/28/jaundice.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Science/Tech", "published_time": "2014-08-28T16:57:22-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-08-28T16:57:21-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "For parents who want to check for jaundice in their newborn at home, a new smartphone app can be of assistance by identifying blood bilirubin levels."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf54e\"", "article_summary": "A condition that\u2019s defined by yellow discoloration of skin and eyes, jaundice affects many infants when they\u2019re first born.\nThough jaundice screening is available in some hospitals, it is usually extremely expensive and can\u2019t be used at home.\nNow, a newly-developed smartphone app will assist parents in screening their babies to see if they need a blood test to check bilirubin levels.\nThe app then reports the baby\u2019s bilirubin levels.\nThe app would provide an easy and accurate way for parents to identify jaundice early."}
