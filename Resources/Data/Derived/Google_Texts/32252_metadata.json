The officer did not sustain a life-threatening injury, and is expected to make a complete recovery.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nTraffic Enforcement Officer Terry Smith was completing a traffic stop at about 6 p.m. Tuesday evening when he heard a loud pop, according to a KTRK news report. Smith felt pain in his lower back and realized he had been shot.\n\nIt is being reported that Smith is undergoing surgery at Memorial Hermann Hospital in the Texas Medical Center. He is expected to make a full recovery.\n\nHouston Police Chief Charles McClelland said the incident appeared to be random in nature, and they are not sure if Smith was the intended target. His comments came during a Tuesday evening press conference.\n\nWhile it is not known if this shooting is related to the ongoing anti-police sentiment making its way across the country, Fox News Channel\u2019s Bill O\u2019Reilly has accused media outlets of fueling the fire against police.\n\n\u201cCertain liberal news programs are hammering down on American police agencies over and over again,\u201d O\u2019Reilly said, according to a Newsmax report. O\u2019Reilly said the repeated message is filtering its way into how young people react to the police, and tied the McKinney incident to this.\n\n\u201cSome people believe the cops in general are the oppressors, especially towards people of color,\u201d he said.\n\nIn April, a Houston Community College police officer was repeatedly stabbed and was nearly killed. Her alleged assailant said he wanted to kill a cop because of the incidents in other cities.\n\nOfficer Smith is expected to make a full recovery. The Houston Police Department will conduct an investigation into the shooting.\n\nBob Price is a senior political news contributor for Breitbart Texas and a member of the original Breitbart Texas team.
