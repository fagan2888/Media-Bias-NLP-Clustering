Barro said it appears Republicans are backing away from their current strategy, explaining that if the government ends up in a shutdown, or misses a bond payment, they\u2019re afraid they\u2019ll get blamed for the economic repercussions.\n\nWhite agreed, adding that the Obama administration has good reason not to back away from its current \u201cwe will not negotiate\u201d position on the debt ceiling.\n\n\u201cThe White House doesn\u2019t want to enshrine this notion where you can ask for this laundry list of demands and if you don\u2019t get them, you\u2019re going to blow up the economy,\u201d White said.\n\n\u201cThe economy is not going to blow up,\u201d Santelli said, referring to the possibility of the U.S. missing a bond payment.\n\n\u201cYou know what?\u201d he added. \u201cYou might say the president knows the bond market better than me. But based on that comment, I don\u2019t think that you do.\u201d\n\nWatch the discussion unfold here [things heat up at around the 04:40 mark]:\n\n\u2013\n\nFollow Becket Adams (@BecketAdams) on Twitter\n\nFeatured image screen grab.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30; polling-uri=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/1.xml; polling-uri2=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/2.xml; polling-uri3=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/3.xml; polling-uri4=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/4.xml", "application-name": "TheBlaze.com", "twitter": {"description": "CNBC's Rick Santelli had a fascinating back-and-forth Friday with Politico\u2019s Ben White and Business Insider\u2019s Josh Barro over the possibility of a government shutdown, the White House's efforts to reduce the deficit, and the looming debt ceiling fight.
