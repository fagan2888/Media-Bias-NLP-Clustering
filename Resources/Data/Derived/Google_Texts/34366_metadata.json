With his 18 points Sunday, James now has 24,383 in his career.\n\nJames, in his 12th NBA season, was close to surpassing Iverson on Friday against the Wizards, when he dropped 28 points in only 25 minutes. But he finished four shy, saving the feat for Sunday at Madison Square Garden.\n\nWhile the achievement is just one of many in James\u2019s career, it probably holds more meaning than others. In 2013, he raved about Iverson in multiple interviews with ESPN, telling Tom Haberstroh that Iverson is \u201cPound-for-pound, probably the greatest player who ever played.\n\n\u201c(Iverson) reminds me of Floyd Mayweather,\u201d James said. \u201cYou could never question (Iverson\u2019s) heart, his will to want to win. A true warrior.\u201d\n\nDays earlier, for ESPN the Magazine\u2019s 2013 NBA preview, James said:\n\n\u201cI watch Jordan more than anybody for sure. But I\u2019ll watch tapes of A.I., too. I don\u2019t take anything from A.I. Well, I do \u2014 his will. They say he was 6 feet, but A.I. was like 5-10 1/2. Do we even want to say 160? 170 (pounds)? Do we even want to give him that much weight? And he played like a 6-8 2-guard. He was one of the greatest finishers we\u2019ve ever seen. You could never question his heart. Ever. He gave it his all. A.I. was like my second-favorite player growing up, after MJ.\u201d\n\nNext up for James on the all-time list is 39-year-old Ray Allen (24,505 points), followed by Patrick Ewing (24,815) and Jerry West (25,192).\n\nWith his last bucket, LeBron James passed Allen Iverson for 22nd on the all-time scoring list! pic.twitter.com/YI4udU0kY8 \u2014 NBA (@NBA) February 22, 2015\n\n(h/t Bleacher Report)", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Allen Iverson,LeBron James", "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "og": {"site_name": "Nuggets Ink", "description": "During the Cavaliers' game against the Knicks on Sunday, LeBron James claimed the No. 22 spot on the NBA's all-time scoring list, moving past former Nugget Allen Iverson.", "title": "LeBron James passes Allen Iverson on NBA's all-time scoring list", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/nuggets/2015/02/22/lebron-james-passes-allen-iverson-nbas-time-scoring-list/12641/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/nuggets/files/2015/02/lebron-james-new-york-knicks.jpg", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "During the Cavaliers' game against the Knicks on Sunday, LeBron James claimed the No. 22 spot on the NBA's all-time scoring list, moving past former Nugget Allen Iverson.", "title": "LeBron James passes Allen Iverson on NBA\u2019s all-time scoring list", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/nuggets/2015/02/22/lebron-james-passes-allen-iverson-nbas-time-scoring-list/12641/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/nuggets/files/2015/02/lebron-james-new-york-knicks.jpg", "creator": "@nickijhabvala", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "language": "en, sv", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "During the Cavaliers' game against the Knicks on Sunday, LeBron James claimed the No. 22 spot on the NBA's all-time scoring list, moving past former Nugget Allen Iverson."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda738\"", "article_summary": "With his last bucket, LeBron James passed Allen Iverson for 22nd on the all-time scoring list!\npic.twitter.com/YI4udU0kY8 \u2014 NBA (@NBA) February 22, 2015(h/t Bleacher Report)\nwas like my second-favorite player growing up, after MJ.\u201dNext up for James on the all-time list is 39-year-old Ray Allen (24,505 points), followed by Patrick Ewing (24,815) and Jerry West (25,192).\nA true warrior.\u201dDays earlier, for ESPN the Magazine\u2019s 2013 NBA preview, James said:\u201cI watch Jordan more than anybody for sure.\nWith about 10:30 remaining in the first quarter of the Cavaliers\u2019 win against the Knicks in New York on Sunday, James scored off a layup that moved him ahead of former Nugget Allen Iverson on the league\u2019s all-time scoring list."}
