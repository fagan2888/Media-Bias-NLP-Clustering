He reveals them in all sorts of ways as he rattles on and on. He can\u2019t help it. His true beliefs seep out of him and become obvious.\n\nThis was on full display in his latest victory speech after he swept all five primaries on Tuesday.\n\nTrump declared that Hillary Clinton does not possess the \u201cstrength\u201d or the \u201cstamina\u201d to be a good president. And he repeated these two words, \u201cstrength\u201d and \u201cstamina.\u201d\n\nOn what basis does Hillary lack strength or stamina? Well, of course, Trump offered no basis whatsoever. And this is because there is no basis. The truth is that Hillary has been a tireless public servant for many years and has demonstrated her extraordinary endurance, far more than has Trump.\n\nIn only her first three years as secretary of state, Hillary broke the record for the greatest amount of travel. She was on the road for 351 days, covered 850,000 miles, and visited at least 102 countries. On a single trip alone, Hillary completed an epic 13-day diplomatic journey of 27,000 miles, which exceeded the circumference of the earth. And at the end, she joked that she was ready for more.\n\nShe has been a veritable whirlwind in her career. She endured a prior full presidential campaign in 2008, she served as a U.S. senator from New York, and, of course, she relished all of her initiatives as first lady for eight years, including leading an enormous undertaking to reform the health care system, which blazed the trail for the eventual passage of Obamacare.\n\nJust thinking about Hillary\u2019s accomplishments alone is exhausting.\n\nAnd yet Trump accuses her of lacking \u201cstrength\u201d and \u201cstamina.\u201d In the absence of any basis in fact, the answer seems apparent. It must be because she is a woman. These are code words revealing Trump\u2019s inner beliefs that women are not as strong and sturdy as men. So a woman is not equal to the task of being president.\n\nHillary \u201cwill not be good for the military,\u201d Trump declared. \u201cShe will not be good for protecting our country.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Donald Trump's sexist attacks on Hillary Clinton reveals how he really feels about women", "title": "This week, Donald Trump reminded us of something very important: His disdain for women oozes from his pores", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Donald Trump's sexist attacks on Hillary Clinton reveals how he really feels about women", "title": "This week, Donald Trump reminded us of something very important: His disdain for women oozes from his pores", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2016/04/29/this_week_donald_trump_reminded_us_of_something_very_important_his_disdain_for_women_oozes_from_his_pores/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/03/trump_hillary5.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Donald Trump's sexist attacks on Hillary Clinton reveals how he really feels about women", "title": "This week, Donald Trump reminded us of something very important: His disdain for women oozes from his pores", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/03/trump_hillary5.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Cody Cain", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Donald Trump, Election 2016, Hillary Clinton, women", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Topics: Donald Trump, Election 2016, Hillary Clinton, women, Elections News, Politics NewsDonald Trump claims that he \u201cloves\u201d women, \u201ccherishes\u201d women, and that as president he will be great for women.\nAnd he repeated these two words, \u201cstrength\u201d and \u201cstamina.\u201dOn what basis does Hillary lack strength or stamina?\nTrump declared that Hillary Clinton does not possess the \u201cstrength\u201d or the \u201cstamina\u201d to be a good president.\nAnd yet Trump accuses her of lacking \u201cstrength\u201d and \u201cstamina.\u201d In the absence of any basis in fact, the answer seems apparent.\nThese are code words revealing Trump\u2019s inner beliefs that women are not as strong and sturdy as men."}
