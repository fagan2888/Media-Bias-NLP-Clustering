She was 66.\n\nThe cause was complications of colon cancer surgery, her son, Nicholas, said.\n\nIn the early 1980s, when almost all theater producers were male and Broadway financing was largely a matter of finding deep-pocketed angels, Ms. Goodwin, who had been trained as an industrial psychologist, was working as an executive in the financial services arm of the Mutual Benefit Life Insurance Company.\n\nShe was interested in the arts and entertainment, and she recognized that though corporations and accredited investors often ventured into movies and art, they rarely did so in theater, which was perceived, not without cause, as too risky.\n\nHer idea was essentially to provide an investment bank for nascent stage productions, putting together producers \u2014 who were enthralled by the idea of financial backers who did not crave or require creative input \u2014 and investors with proven track records who were willing to try their hand in a new arena.\n\nAs a result, previously untapped corporate and individual sources of financing began to find their way to the theater. Under the Mutual Benefit umbrella, Ms. Goodwin backed a Royal Shakespeare Company production of \u201cAll\u2019s Well That Ends Well\u201d in New York.\n\nThat show lost money, but then she and Mutual Benefit raised $300,000, about a third of the total cost, for the London production of \u201cLes Miz.\u201d Opening in October 1985, it returned 167 percent to investors in the first year and a half and went on to become an international megahit.\n\n\u201cIn every other area of entertainment there are funds from financial markets, huge funds, but they have almost been enemies of the theater,\u201d Elizabeth Williams, who became Ms. Goodwin\u2019s business partner, said in an interview. \u201cThat 7 of 10 shows fails is true, but if you focus on people with track records \u2014 which is what they do in the financial markets anyway \u2014 you have better results. Karen was a visionary in bringing corporate funding to theater through syndications.\u201d\n\nToday, almost every fund-raiser for a Broadway show receives producer credit, but that wasn\u2019t necessarily the case in the 1980s and \u201990s; Ms. Goodwin often went unmentioned above the title in a production\u2019s Playbill.\n\nAfter the success of \u201cLes Miz,\u201d Ms. Goodwin and Ms. Williams became financiers for its producer, Cameron Mackintosh, and the English-language productions of his blockbuster shows \u201cPhantom\u201d and \u201cMiss Saigon.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMs. Goodwin was a producer of \u201cAnnie Warbucks,\u201d a 1993 sequel to \u201cAnnie,\u201d and \u201cThe Ark,\u201d a 2005 musical based on the biblical story of Noah, both of which ran Off Broadway.\n\nWith Ms. Williams, she formed Fifth Avenue Productions, which helped produce \u201cInto the Woods,\u201d the 1987 Stephen Sondheim-James Lapine musical treatment of Grimm\u2019s fairy tales that ran for nearly two years on Broadway; and \u201cThe Gospel at Colonus,\u201d an adventurous musical adaptation by Bob Telson and Lee Breuer of Sophocles\u2019 \u201cOedipus at Colonus\u201d that appeared on Broadway in 1988.\n\n\u201cFirst of all, she and her partner were unusual at the time because they were women,\u201d Michael David, of Dodger Productions, the lead producer of \u201cGospel at Colonus,\u201d said in an interview about Ms. Goodwin and Ms. Williams. \u201cAnd they were very important to us. They came to us when we didn\u2019t have any money and they had a little.\u201d\n\nKaren Jeanne Walter was born in Fort Dix, N.J., on April 8, 1948, and grew up in Maryland and Texas. Her father worked in the insurance business. She graduated from Southern Methodist University, where she and Ms. Williams were classmates, and earned a master\u2019s degree in psychology from Northeastern University. She also studied at the C. G. Jung Institute in Zurich.\n\nMs. Goodwin\u2019s first marriage ended in an annulment. Her second marriage, to Stephen Goodwin, a writer and teacher, ended in divorce. In addition to her son, Nicholas, she is survived by her father, Richard S. Walter; two brothers, Richard Walter Jr. and Michael Walter, and a sister, Donna Jeanne Walter.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20140727204043, "twitter": {"description": "Ms. Goodwin became a theater producer at a time when few women were associated with finding sources of capital.", "creator": "nytbruceweber", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/28/arts/music/karen-walter-goodwin-producer-of-broadway-hits-dies-at-66.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003023897"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "title": "Karen Walter Goodwin, Producer of Broadway Hits, Dies at 66", "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/07/27/arts/dog-goodwin-obit/dog-goodwin-obit-thumbLarge-v3.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/28/arts/music/karen-walter-goodwin-producer-of-broadway-hits-dies-at-66.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003023897", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/28/arts/music/karen-walter-goodwin-producer-of-broadway-hits-dies-at-66.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "arts/music", "hdl_p": "Karen Walter Goodwin, 66, Producer of Broadway Hits", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/arts/music/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "July 27, 2014", "edt": "NewYork", "ttl": "Les Miserables (Play)", "keywords": "Goodwin  Karen Walter (1948-2014),Theater,Finances,Deaths (Obituaries),Playbill,Southern Methodist University,Miss Saigon (Play),The Phantom of the Opera (Play),Les Miserables (Play),Goodwin  Karen Walter", "description": "Ms. Goodwin became a theater producer at a time when few women were associated with finding sources of capital.", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Bruce Weber", "SCG": "music", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "per": "Goodwin, Karen Walter (1948-2014)", "slug": "28goodwin", "byl": "By BRUCE WEBER", "thumbnail_150_height": 150, "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "Ms. Goodwin became a theater producer at a time when few women were associated with finding sources of capital.", "tom": "Obituary (Obit)", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/07/27/arts/dog-goodwin-obit/dog-goodwin-obit-thumbStandard-v3.jpg", "news_keywords": "Theater,Finance,Playbill", "CG": "arts", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "July 27, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "Obituary (Obit)", "org": "Southern Methodist University", "thumbnail_height": 75, "thumbnail_150_width": 150, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20140728184242, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/28/arts/music/karen-walter-goodwin-producer-of-broadway-hits-dies-at-66.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/07/27/arts/dog-goodwin-obit/dog-goodwin-obit-videoSixteenByNine600.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Ms. Goodwin became a theater producer at a time when few women were associated with finding sources of capital.", "title": "Karen Walter Goodwin, Producer of Broadway Hits, Dies at 66"}, "pdate": 20140727, "des": "Deaths (Obituaries)", "article": {"author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/w/bruce_weber/index.html", "section": "Music", "modified": "2014-07-28", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/arts/music/index.jsonp", "tag": "Les Miserables (Play)", "published": "2014-07-27", "section-taxonomy-id": "C5BFA7D5-359C-427B-90E6-6B7245A6CDD8"}, "articleid": 100000003023897, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "Karen Walter Goodwin, Producer of Broadway Hits, Dies at 66", "thumbnail_150": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/07/27/arts/dog-goodwin-obit/dog-goodwin-obit-thumbLarge-v3.jpg", "PST": "Obituary (Obit)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde26c\"", "article_summary": "Under the Mutual Benefit umbrella, Ms. Goodwin backed a Royal Shakespeare Company production of \u201cAll\u2019s Well That Ends Well\u201d in New York.\nIn addition to her son, Nicholas, she is survived by her father, Richard S.
