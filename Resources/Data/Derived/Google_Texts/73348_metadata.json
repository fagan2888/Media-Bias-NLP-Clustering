Complaints are coming into BBB alleging issues with receiving unsolicited mailings from Script Relief LLC or one of its other brand names containing prescription discount cards.\n\nAccording to the company's website, residents receiving the card can take it to local pharmacies in order to receive an automatic discount on prescriptions without signing up for or paying for the service. Receipt of these cards is raising concern from consumers who are worried about potential identity theft, healthcare fraud, or that their personal information is being collected and distributed for unknown purposes.\n\nSome consumers tell BBB that documentation received from the company mimics official government notices by using a brand name such as \u201cUnited States Prescription Discounts,\u201d along with terms phrases such as \u201cResident Code,\u201d and a Washington D.C. return mailing address. These factors contribute to some consumers reporting that they thought this is an official program of the U.S. government or part of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nBBB offers the following tips on pharmacy discount cards:\n\n\u00b7 Start with Trust\u00ae. Always check with BBB before doing business.\n\n\u00b7 If you are considering using a discount prescription or pharmacy card, be aware that the card is not insurance.

Although the savings may be real with the discount card, they may be based on prices other than the ones offered by local pharmacies.\n\n\u00b7 Compare prices to get the best price for the medication. And if you're really struggling to pay for your medications, talk to your pharmacist about patient assistance programs that could provide even greater discounts.\n\n\u00b7 Guard personal and banking information.
