Yet it left Georgia still having 210,000 kids without coverage, the fourth-largest total in the nation, according to the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation report, released Thursday.\n\nThe rate of uninsured children in Georgia fell from 10 percent to 8 percent in 2014, still among the highest percentages among the states.\n\nNationally, the report said that the number of children lacking health insurance fell by 1 million in 2014, which lowered the uninsured children\u2019s rate from 7.5 percent to 6.3 percent.\n\nThe ACA was clearly the biggest force behind the decrease in uninsured children in Georgia, said Bill Custer, a health insurance expert at Georgia State University. Many parents found out that their kids were eligible for Medicaid or PeachCare for Kids during the enrollment process for the ACA insurance exchange, he said.\n\n\u201cThe ACA helped to streamline the enrollment process,\u2019\u2019 Custer added.\n\nThe findings were similar to a report in October from Georgetown University Health Policy Institute\u2019s Center for Children and Families, which put the number of uninsured Georgia children at 189,000.\n\nBut the new report, conducted by researchers at the University of Minnesota, counted children through age 18, while the Georgetown study did not include 18-year-olds, said Elizabeth Lukanen of Minnesota\u2019s State Health Access Data Assistance Center.\n\nThe percentage of Georgia children on Medicaid or PeachCare rose by 2 percentage points during 2014, while those with private coverage remained about the same, the report said.\n\nThe decline in Georgia\u2019s uninsured children came across the board, including \u201call incomes, races and ethnic groups,\u201d Lukanen said.\n\nThe remaining uninsured tend to be kids in the lowest-income families, she said. They include immigrant children, who, if not in the country legally, are not eligible for the public coverage.\n\nCuster said that in Georgia, \u201cwe have a large population under 200 percent of [the federal poverty level], and children are a big part of it.\u201d\n\nMany of these children may have parents who remain uninsured, and have not engaged in the enrollment process because they are in the \u201ccoverage gap\u2019\u2019 \u2013 making too much income to qualify for Medicaid but not enough to get discounts on coverage through the exchange.\n\nThirty states have filled that gap through Medicaid expansion under the ACA, which extends the program\u2019s coverage to more people. Georgia has decided against expansion, citing the costs to the state.\n\n\u201cParents who gain coverage leads to more kids gaining coverage,\u201d Lukanen said.\n\nThe report shows that nearly half the nation\u2019s 5 million uninsured children live in just six states \u2014 California, Texas, Florida, New York, Georgia and Arizona. And while it\u2019s true that these six also have high overall populations, as a group they contain far less than half of the nation\u2019s people.\n\nPolly McKinney of the advocacy group Voices for Georgia\u2019s Children noted that while the number of Georgia kids without insurance is dropping, \u201cthe number is still high and illustrates the significant need to improve not only our enrollment systems, but to increase the public awareness about the importance of making sure all children have health insurance, whether public or private.\u201d\n\n\u201cOn top of that, we know that when children are insured, there is one less barrier to good, timely and cost-effective care, which is key to keeping kids in school and on the path to long-term success,\u201d she added.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Athens News, Athens Georgia, Athens Banner Herald, Athens, Georgia, Georgia Bulldogs, Dawgs, Bulldogs, Music, UGA, newspaper, 30601, Clarke County, Madison, Oconee, Oglethorpe, Dogs, 30602, 30603, 30604, 30605, Richt, SEC football, Jackson County, R.E.M., Widespread Panic, B-52s, Mobile, Local News, Andy Miller", "og": {"site_name": "Online Athens", "description": "The number of uninsured Georgia children fell by more than 50,000 in 2014, the first year of full implementation of the Affordable Care Act, a new report found.", "title": "Georgia has fewer uninsured kids as Affordable Care Act takes hold", "url": "http://onlineathens.com/mobile/2016-02-12/georgia-has-fewer-uninsured-kids-affordable-care-act-takes-hold", "image": "http://onlineathens.com/sites/default/files/AP_235029814543.jpg", "type": "article"}, "description": "OnlineAthens.com is the daily online edition of The Athens (GA) Banner-Herald."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd017\"", "article_summary": "ATLANTA | The number of uninsured Georgia children fell by more than 50,000 in 2014, the first year of full implementation of the Affordable Care Act, a new report found.\nThe ACA was clearly the biggest force behind the decrease in uninsured children in Georgia, said Bill Custer, a health insurance expert at Georgia State University.\nThe rate of uninsured children in Georgia fell from 10 percent to 8 percent in 2014, still among the highest percentages among the states.\nThe decline in Georgia\u2019s uninsured children came across the board, including \u201call incomes, races and ethnic groups,\u201d Lukanen said.\nThe report shows that nearly half the nation\u2019s 5 million uninsured children live in just six states \u2014 California, Texas, Florida, New York, Georgia and Arizona."}
