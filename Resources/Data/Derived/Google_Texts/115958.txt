— At the street corner where bullets ended a 15-year-old’s life, residents hope it will be the same spot where things start to change.

It was at the corner of East Highland Avenue and Woodland Avenue where Brian Freeman was shot and killed on Friday.

Brian was walking with a friend when a car pulled alongside the 15-year-old and shots were fired, said his aunt, Gloria Deans.

“It is just terrible when a child can’t walk home safely,” she said. “It is awful. It should not be that way. No child deserves to die like that.”

Dozens gathered and marched to that street corner on Monday, outraged over what happened here days ago.

“Ask for help, there are programs to get your kids out of gangs,” said LaTonya Sharpe, who organized the march. “You cannot let these people have your children or we will be back here again.”

Investigators have not said whether the shooting was gang related, but many believe it was.

Those who marched carried signs. They invited neighbors to join as they walked. Many did.

They shouted for an end to the violence.

“This child here, this did not have to happen,” Sharpe said.

Robert Freeman was among those who walked. A cousin of Brian, he had a message for those causing trouble.

“Stop being stupid,” he said. “Act like you have sense. Go do something positive with your life and stop shooting people.”
