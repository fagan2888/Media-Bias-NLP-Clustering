Musicians who played with her and a small, devout passel of fans still talk about her concerts with you-had-to-be-there reverence.\n\nEva Cassidy at Blues Alley in Washington in January 1996, 10 months before her death. Larry Melton photo Search photos available for purchase: Photo Store \u2192\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re still applauding Eva Cassidy,\u201d says Mick Fleetwood, the Fleetwood Mac co-founder and drummer, who became a devotee of Cassidy\u2019s while listening to her sing at Fleetwood\u2019s, the Alexandria, Virginia, restaurant he owned and operated in the mid-1990s. \u201cWe\u2019re keeping the campfire burning, letting people know about her. We want people to know about her!\u201d\n\nYet, for all the devotion of those left behind, it remains true that you can take away every album sold before Cassidy died of cancer at age 33 in 1996, and that wouldn\u2019t make a dent in her overall numbers. And that there was precious little demand for her as a live performer during her career.\n\nThroughout the year before she died, Cassidy and her tight and tight-knit band played regularly at Shootz, a billiard room in Bethesda, Maryland. The cover charge for her Shootz shows was $3, which bought you four sets by Cassidy and her band \u2013 a cohesive ensemble willing and able to play jazz or blues or torch songs or whatever Cassidy felt like playing that night \u2013 plus $3 in pool credit.\n\nThese days, Fleetwood (who occasionally sat in with Cassidy and her band) is one of literally millions of music fans around the world who are assured that Cassidy\u2019s voice should never have had to fight racked billiard balls for attention. Next month marks the 20th anniversary of her first headlining gigs at Blues Alley, a pair of performances that were supposed to improve her professional lot, and which are largely responsible for the posthumous fame.\n\n\u201cIt all goes back to Blues Alley,\u201d says Chris Biondo, her bassist, producer, sidekick, ex-paramour, and, to this day, most devout supporter.\n\nThe shows were recorded and proved at long last that she was indeed fit for the finest music rooms. The anniversary of the gigs is being commemorated with the release of \u201cNightbird,\u201d a 33-song set taken almost entirely from one of her nights at the hallowed Georgetown club.\n\n\u201cWe always had trouble getting Eva to finish things, like a (studio) record,\u201d Cassidy\u2019s arranger and pianist Lenny Williams says. \u201cAl (Dale, Cassidy\u2019s longtime manager) wanted a recording, and Chris thought doing a live album, getting it out quickly, getting her something she could sell, something for critics to write up, was the answer. And Eva said yes.\u201d\n\nThey aimed high when targeting a venue for the project: Blues Alley, a nightclub that despite its small size \u2013 capacity is only 124 \u2013 has since 1965 hosted jazz titans including Sarah Vaughan, Maynard Ferguson, Ella Fitzgerald, Dizzy Gillespie, Wynton Marsalis and on and on.\n\nCassidy had occupied the Blues Alley stage before, but as part of a duo with D.C. music legend Chuck Brown, and everybody in her circle knew that it was the go-go godfather, and not Cassidy, that brought such a booking.\n\nBut Dale talked management into letting her headline a show with her band. He got two nights, in fact: Jan. 2 and 3, 1996.\n\n\u201cThe club gave us the two worst nights for clubs in America,\u201d says Williams, laughing. \u201cRight after New Year\u2019s, when everybody\u2019s worn out from the holidays. Nobody goes out.\u201d\n\nBut bad dates sometimes beat the heck out of no dates. Cassidy took the offer.\n\nSince all expenses were coming out of pocket, the Blues Alley recording was done on the cheap. Biondo says he helped the recording engineer load in all the equipment to get a break on the regular rate. He also used a box of pre-owned digital tapes he bought at a deep discount.\n\nAs things turned out, it was a good thing they had an extended stay.\n\nShortly after the band left the club to huge huzzahs from the packed house after the opening show, Biondo and Williams sat down to check out the tapes. And they got crushing news: \u201cThere was a hum from beginning to end,\u201d Biondo says. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t something we could work around. It was a deal breaker.\u201d\n\nNothing was salvageable. Biondo decided to record over everything from the first night. That left one show to nail every note. Or at least try.\n\n\u201cSo what you got the second night was a very pissed-off band,\u201d says Cassidy\u2019s longtime drummer, Raice McLeod. \u201cWe all knew the first night was terrific, and we were relaxed and comfortable probably because we knew we had another night coming. But that\u2019s all lost. Now we\u2019ve got a one-shot deal.\u201d\n\nGuitarist Keith Grimes says he fretted that Cassidy\u2019s worrying about the opening night\u2019s sonic disaster would hinder her performance for the closing show. No need.\n\n\u201cMostly I was savoring the experience of playing for an audience that appreciated us, and I knew a Blues Alley audience would,\u201d Grimes says.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t want Eva to fixate on wasting the first night, and just told her, \u2018Everything\u2019s going to be beautiful, they\u2019re going to love it, let\u2019s go do it!\u2019 And we did.\u201d\n\nFor all the worries, Biondo says, the tapes from the second show played back as wonderfully as he had hoped.\n\nCASSIDY, BIONDO and Dale formed their own label to release the recordings and called it CBD Records after the initials of their surnames. To pay for the manufacture of CDs, Cassidy used money she had been given by an aunt. Biondo recalls Cassidy being pretty sure she had wasted the gift.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d ordered a lot of a thousand CDs,\u201d says Biondo. \u201cI remember driving with her to Virginia to go pick them up from the CD plant. She thought we bought too many. So the whole ride she was saying she knows she\u2019ll have boxes and boxes of them lying around forever, really concerned that for the rest of her life she\u2019d be seeing these things in her basement. I was telling her don\u2019t worry about that, that it would be fine. But, I thought it would be a great thing to sell the 1,000 we had.\u201d\n\nBiondo probably would have been content if the Blues Alley recordings improved Cassidy\u2019s local fame enough to get her out of Shootz forever.\n\nAs things turned out, the recordings brought her international acclaim, and millions of \u201cLive at Blues Alley\u201d discs have been sold.\n\nBut those sales didn\u2019t come on CBD Records. \u201cLive at Blues Alley\u201d was originally released in May 1996. Weeks later, while Dale and members of the band were still hand-delivering copies of the disc to area record stores in hopes they would offer it for sale, Cassidy showed up limping to a record-release party; doctors told Cassidy her hip had been destroyed by cancer, which until then she was unaware she had. She soon learned the disease had spread throughout her body, and that she didn\u2019t have long to live.\n\nAbout a month before Cassidy\u2019s death, her friend and fellow local musician Grace Griffith sent a CD of Cassidy\u2019s recordings to Blix Street Records, a folk label based in Gig Harbor, Washington. Griffith told Blix Street boss Bill Straw that Cassidy deserved a record deal, and that she was terminally ill.\n\nTHAT CASSIDY DIDN\u2019T HAVE a record label was part bad luck and part her own choice. The iconic jazz label Blue Note infamously passed on signing her, but others came calling. Fleetwood remembers Cassidy telling him about a trip to the offices of a New York label that went south when a record executive began telling her what she should sing.\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018You may have to be open to some of these suggestions that some of these people might have!\u2019 \u201d recalled Fleetwood, who now lives in Hawaii, by phone. \u201cAnd Eva said, \u2018Mick, I\u2019m not that person.\u2019\u2026 She was very adamant about not compromising.\u201d\n\nAfter hearing the CD that Griffith gave him, Straw says the record label boss part of him wanted to get on a plane and fly to D.C. and sign Cassidy before anybody else did, prognosis be damned. But the humanitarian in him kept him from disturbing her in her final days. She died on Nov. 2, 1996. After her death, he worked out a deal with Eva\u2019s parents, Hugh and Barbara Cassidy, who lived in suburban Maryland and controlled her estate.\n\nIn 1998, Blix released \u201cSongbird.\u201d The collection featured some songs taken from Blues Alley, others recorded by Biondo at his studios.\n\nThe record had middling success in most of the United States. But Cassidy\u2019s posthumous career took off when a BBC producer in London got a copy of \u201cSongbird\u201d and began playing a live version of \u201cFields of Gold\u201d and a studio rendition of \u201cOver the Rainbow.\u201d The phones lit up.\n\nThe U.K. was enthralled. An amateur video of Cassidy singing \u201cOver the Rainbow\u201d filmed at Blues Alley was played on BBC-TV\u2019s \u201cTop of the Pops\u201d and quickly became the most-requested video in the program\u2019s history, according to the show\u2019s producers. A handful of gold record singles and millions of CD sales followed.\n\nTo take advantage of Cassidy\u2019s reverse British Invasion from the beyond, Blix put out its own version of \u201cLive at Blues Alley,\u201d also in 1998. The Cassidy craze peaked with the BBC putting her interpretation of \u201cOver the Rainbow\u201d on its \u201cSongs of the Century\u201d album in 1999. Sales of her records remained strong throughout Europe for years.\n\nSO, THERE IS DEMAND for new old stuff: Yet, the release of \u201cNightbird\u201d has sparked discussion of exploitation among band members. The original \u201cLive at Blues Alley\u201d had 12 live tracks. To sweeten the pot for \u201cNightbird,\u201d Blix Records has added 19 more tracks taped at the Jan. 3, 1996, show, including covers of Aretha Franklin\u2019s \u201cChain of Fools\u201d and Cyndi Lauper\u2019s \u201cTime After Time.\u201d That\u2019s 31 songs from that evening, plus two more bonus tracks.\n\nMcLeod says he feels the real Eva comes out on the Blues Alley tapes. \u201cShe could walk on stage and be embarrassed about saying \u2018good evening\u2019 or \u2018thanks for coming,\u2019 \u201d he says. \u201cBut then the music would start and she\u2019d open her mouth and just nail a song to the wall, and the room\u2019s going crazy, and this little, shy \u2018thank you\u2019 would come out. She was the classic introvert.\u201d\n\nThere is nevertheless a fairly strong sense among band members that more isn\u2019t always merrier, that releasing everything isn\u2019t the greatest way to pay tribute to Cassidy. They say she had been fighting a cold heading into the Blues Alley gigs, and that on the tapes of the second night you can hear her voice occasionally cracking. (The idea of Cassidy\u2019s voice cracking is positively absurd to many of her fans.)\n\n\u201cAt what point do you try to protect the legacy of the artist? I don\u2019t know,\u201d says Williams, who says he can\u2019t help but listen for notes he would play differently on the new recording. \u201cYou have on one side a feeling of picking over the bones, and the other argument is the fans want to hear everything.\u201d\n\nBut Williams, who now runs a business with Biondo composing and recording music for television and cinema, has been around long enough to know that artistic differences between labels and performers have been around as long as labels and performers. The label always wins.\n\n\u201cSo my feeling is you emotionally prepare yourself that eventually everything from Eva is going to be put out,\u201d he says, \u201cand the good stuff will far outweigh the bad.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Eva Cassidy has sold more than 12 million albums, most of them after her death from cancer at 33 in 1996.", "generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "description": "Eva Cassidy has sold more than 12 million albums, most of them after her death from cancer at 33 in 1996.", "title": "The life-after-death career and sad success story of an American vocalist - The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 909, "identifier": "http://www.pressherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/772688_206449-cassidy.jpg", "height": 999}, "updated_time": "2015-12-25T12:26:02-04:00", "url": "http://www.pressherald.com/2015/12/27/the-life-after-death-career-and-sad-success-story-of-an-american-vocalist/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Eva Cassidy has sold more than 12 million albums, most of them after her death from cancer at 33 in 1996.", "creator": "@pressherald", "image": "http://www.pressherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/772688_206449-cassidy.jpg", "title": "The life-after-death career and sad success story of an American vocalist - The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "site": "@pressherald", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=951845858", "fb": {"admins": 769488179, "app_id": 178078215650057}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/pressherald", "section": "Arts & Entertainment", "published_time": "2015-12-27T04:00:00-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-12-25T12:26:02-04:00"}, "google-site-verification": "QWs9pxQP8fwo2-nR5mWopc6qCK2D3920f7bl-U-zkso", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Since all expenses were coming out of pocket, the Blues Alley recording was done on the cheap.\nEva Cassidy at Blues Alley in Washington in January 1996, 10 months before her death.\n\u201cWe always had trouble getting Eva to finish things, like a (studio) record,\u201d Cassidy\u2019s arranger and pianist Lenny Williams says.\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The saddest part of the mostly heartwarming story of singer Eva Cassidy is that she had to die to get the renown she deserved.\nCASSIDY, BIONDO and Dale formed their own label to release the recordings and called it CBD Records after the initials of their surnames."}
