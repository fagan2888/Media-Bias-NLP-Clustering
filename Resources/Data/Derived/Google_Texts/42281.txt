Lee Park’s 50-year-old Easter celebration was back on track Sunday after taking a year off.

Turtle Creek Boulevard was closed from Lemmon Avenue to North Hall Street for the festivities, which included live music and food and beverage vendors.

But the real attraction was the Petropolitan Pooch Parade. The event’s co-hosts were LeeAnne Locken from The Real Housewives of Dallas and Steve Kemble, “America’s sassiest lifestyle guru.” Prizes were awarded in various categories, including most creative.
