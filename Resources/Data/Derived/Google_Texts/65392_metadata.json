James Harrington, it was a day he thought would never arrive.\n\nIt had been two and a half years since he last saw his golden-haired, brown-eyed girl, and Harrington had made a point to keep track of the 7-year-old\u2019s travels, even after their lives went separate ways.\n\nBut standing at Armstrong International Airport in New Orleans on June 26, it was finally time for Harrington, 37, to reunite with Army Sgt. 1st Class Ryky.\n\nRyky is a Belgian Malinois, a type of Belgian sheep-herding dog, and she was headed to the Big Easy on a Southwest Airlines flight from Houston.\n\n\u201cEven though we were [apart] for two and a half years, it\u2019s that you don\u2019t forget the dog \u2014 and the dogs don\u2019t forget,\u201d Harrington says.\n\nHarrington and Ryky, trained as an explosive-detection dog, met in 2008. They went on to do two tours together in the war zones of the 21st century. From September 2008 to October 2009, the pair deployed to Iraq, and from September 2010 to October 2011, they were in Afghanistan.\n\nHarrington was Ryky\u2019s handler, she his military working dog. A rank typically is assigned to each military working dog \u2014 one higher than the dog\u2019s handler.\n\nHarrington\u2019s active duty service ended in January 2012, but Ryky had a few more years in her. So the pair parted ways.\n\nHe went back to Iraq to work as a K-9 handler with the Department of State and then on to the National Guard. She got a new handler and training at Lackland Air Force Base in Texas, and redeployment to Afghanistan for another four months.\n\nUnder current law, the military classifies its working dogs as equipment, and those \u201cretired\u201d while overseas aren\u2019t granted transport back to the United States.\n\nOrganizations are lobbying Congress to change the official language defining military working dogs. As it reads today, Harrington might never have been reunited with Ryky.\n\nHappily, though, two months since his airport reunion with Ryky, he figures, \u201cShe\u2019s always going to look out for me.\u201d\n\nA Dogged Role in U.S. Military\n\nMilitary working dogs caught the public\u2019s attention in 2011, when it was reported that one of the members of SEAL Team 6 had four legs and a fur coat. Cairo, also a Belgian Malinois, served alongside the elite special operations forces during the raid on Osama bin Laden\u2019s compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan.\n\nCanines, though, have long been integrated with troops serving overseas.\n\nThe United States began employing military dogs in 1942. In 1971, they were brought in to combat marijuana use among military personnel stationed in Southeast Asia and to detect explosives.\n\nDecades later, in 2005, the Pentagon introduced a new kind of \u201cdetector dog\u201d to stem the rising number of attacks on U.S. troops using improvised explosive devices (IEDs) in Afghanistan and Iraq. These canines, or specialized search dogs, can detect IEDs, arms, ammunition and explosives.\n\nThen, in 2010, the Air Force\u2019s 341st Training Squadron at Lackland Air Force Base in Texas, which trains military working dogs and handlers, teamed up with the Marine Corps to train Combat Tracker Dog Teams. These dogs, the first of their kind since the conclusion of the Vietnam War, are trained to recognize and follow human targets.\n\nSince the beginning of the Afghanistan War in 2001, the Department of Defense has spent more than $941,000 on acquiring military working dogs, according to an analysis of government contracts.\n\nMore than 2,500 military working dogs currently serve, roughly 500 deployed at a time.\n\n>>> Commentary: A Dog\u2019s Life for Veterans\n\nIn an interview with The Daily Signal, Dr. Robin Ganzert, president of the American Humane Association, says of the working dogs:\n\nBecause of their great ability to seek enemy positions, sniff out IEDs and weapons caches, they\u2019re saving so many lives. It\u2019s allowing mothers and fathers to come home from war and see their kiddos, and sons and daughters to come home from war. These dogs are doing a great, heroic service.\n\nSaving Lives\n\nA military working dog may save the lives of 150 to 200 soldiers, Ganzert says.\n\nHarrington, though, says its hard to come up with a solid number. The Army veteran cites the Kevin Costner film \u201cThe Guardian,\u201d in which a Coast Guard rescue swimmer says he remembers not the countless lives saved, but the lives lost, throughout his career.\n\nAnd Harrington has chosen to do the same, counting the number of friends \u2014 both humans and canines \u2014 lost in battle.\n\nThat number, he tells The Daily Signal, is one: Sgt. Zainah Creamer, a fellow handler; she trained and accompanied Harrington on missions.\n\nIt\u2019s difficult not to focus on the lives saved, though. Ryky has been honored for heroic actions on the battlefield.\n\nOn July 6, 2011, during their deployment to Afghanistan, Harrington and Ryky were riding in the last vehicle in a convoy of three.\n\nThe vehicle leading the convoy rolled over a particular spot in the road without incident. The second in line hit an IED, and the explosion rocked through Harrington and Ryky\u2019s vehicle as it followed.\n\nTwo personnel were wounded; one, an Air Force special operations soldier, shattered a leg from big toe to pelvis. Harrington and Ryky sprang into action.\n\n>>> Five Factors from the New CBO Report on Veterans\u2019 Health Care\n\nDog and handler cleared a path to the lead vehicle, giving medical personnel access to the wounded. The pair then made a path out of the ambush site and created space for a medivac to land and take out the wounded.\n\nFor her actions, Ryky was awarded the K9 Medal for Exceptional Service. The medal comes from K9s of the War on Terror Inc., an organization that recognizes the work of K9 teams across the military, the Department of Homeland Security and law enforcement.\n\nLeft Behind at Retirement\n\nFor military personnel, retirement means returning home to U.S. soil and a grateful nation. But for military working dogs, the end of a career doesn\u2019t lead to a ride home on a military transport, Ganzert explains.\n\nThe dogs are considered equipment by the Pentagon, and upon \u201cretirement,\u201d despite their assigned ranks, they aren\u2019t treated as canine veterans. Just like a tank or armored vehicle, not all military equipment makes it back to the States, and some dogs are left in shelters in the countries where they end their service.\n\nSuch is the case with Maxi, a shepherd mix retired in Japan. The American Humane Association is working to bring Maxi home and reunite her with the handler she served alongside, but doing so costs roughly $6,000.\n\nAs the public learned more about Cairo, the dog from the SEALS\u2019 bin Laden raid, animal advocates called on the Air Force to classify the dogs as something other than equipment \u2014 thus allowing them to retire on U.S. soil.\n\nThe Air Force agreed to do so, but Ganzert says there is little evidence that actions have followed the words.\n\nLast year, Congress included language in the annual National Defense Authorization Act addressing the retirement of military working dogs for the first time:\n\nIf the secretary of the military department concerned determines a military working dog should be retired, and no suitable adoption is available at the military facility where the dog is located, the secretary may transfer the dog 1.) to the 341st Training Squadron; or 2.) to another location for adoption under this section.\n\nThe secretary of defense also is given the authority to \u201cestablish and maintain a system to provide for the veterinary care of retired military working dogs.\u201d\n\nHowever, there is an odd caveat: No federal funds are allowed to be appropriated to provide for such veterinary care.\n\nGanzert praises Congress and the military for taking steps to address retirement of the dogs, but says the issue is the NDAA\u2019s use of the word \u201cmay\u201d before the word \u201ctransfer,\u201d which, she says, provides a loophole for the military.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s absolutely best to reunite these dogs where the bond is the strongest,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd the bond forged on the battlefield is the strongest bond we can imagine. We need to give the dogs a chance.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe bond forged on the battlefield is the strongest bond we can imagine. We need to give the dogs a chance,\u201d says @RobinGanzert\n\nComing Home\n\nJust three months after the pair\u2019s heroic mission in Afghanistan, Harrington and Ryky were separated. He left active duty after nine years in the Army; she was assigned a new handler.\n\nHarrington, now a staff sergeant in the National Guard, followed Ryky\u2019s military career. He checked in with her new handler at least twice a month. If he had a piece of gear that might be useful, he would ship it.\n\nIn the summer of 2012, Ryky was deployed back to Afghanistan. After four months, her handler received a non-combat injury. The soldier went home to Fort Carson, Colo., and so did Ryky.\n\nA dog\u2019s handler is offered the first opportunity at adoption; when Ryky was retired, though, her new handler passed.\n\nIn May, Harrington got a phone call saying Ryky was his if he wanted her. The day had finally come.\n\n>>> These Veterans Served in Iraq. They Sound Off About What\u2019s Going on There Today.\n\nAs Harrington says, \u201cyou don\u2019t forget the dog \u2014 and the dogs don\u2019t forget.\u201d\n\nOn June 26, Harrington headed to the airport to pick up Ryky from the care of Mission K9 Rescue, a Houston-based nonprofit that provides transportation, adoption and professional assistance for military working dogs. He says of the reunion:\n\nI don\u2019t have any kids, and I\u2019m not married, but from everybody I talk to that does have kids, it\u2019s pretty much like having your first born.\n\nCalling on Capitol Hill\n\nIn an effort to call more attention to military and contract working dogs (those provided through private companies), the American Humane Association\u2019s Ganzert and representatives of Mission K9 Rescue headed to Capitol Hill late last month.\n\nThey brought three military working dogs: Ryky, Cila and Thor. They also brought the veterans the dogs served alongside in Afghanistan and Iraq: Harrington, Army Sgt. Jason Bos and Marine Corps. Sgt. Deano Miller, respectively.\n\nThe veteran-canine teams met with Reps. Gus Bilirakis, R-Fla., Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, R-Fla., Dina Titus, D-Nev., and Don Young, R-Alaska.\n\nThe Humane Association and Mission K9 have called on Congress to change the language of the National Defense Authorization Act so that military working dogs are retired only once they are returned to the United States.\n\nAfter the August recess, Bilirakis plans to explore changing the NDAA\u2019s language to require the Pentagon to do that. First, though, the Florida Republican hopes to determine the related cost, since he would prefer not to spend any federal dollars.\n\nIn an interview with The Daily Signal, Bilirakis says:\n\nWe want to be fiscally responsible. \u2026The bottom line is we have to help the veterans because they\u2019re the true American heroes. I\u2019d love to see them reunited with these wonderful hero dogs.\n\nIdeally, Bilirakis says, Congress would work with nonprofits such as the American Humane Association to cover the cost of bringing the dogs home.\n\n\u201cThe bottom line is we have to help the veterans because they\u2019re the true American heroes,\u201d says @RepGusBilirakis\n\nIn February 2012, Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., and Rep. Walter Jones, R-N.C., introduced the Canine Members of the Armed Forces Act, which would direct the Pentagon to classify military working dogs as canine members of the armed forces rather than as equipment.\n\nUnder the legislation, retired military working dogs would be transferred to the 341st Training Squadron if \u201cno suitable adoption\u201d is available.\n\nNeither the House nor the Senate passed the measure in its complete form, but the language \u2014 complete with the \u201cmay\u201d loophole \u2014 was included in the 2013 NDAA signed by President Obama.\n\nGanzert acknowledges that transporting the canines back to the U.S. presents a logistical challenge. It\u2019s easier for the Pentagon to leave a dog where it is, she says, instead of dealing with the red tape of transporting a dog home. That includes coordinating how the animal is going to get back to the States, and who will pick up the dog once it arrives.\n\nIt should be worth the effort, Ganzert argues: \u201cJust because they have four legs and a lot of fur doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re not a veteran.\u201d\n\n\u201cJust because they have four legs and a lot of fur doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re not a veteran,\u201d says @RobinGanzert\n\nPutting the Pieces Back Together\n\nHarrington and Ryky had no shortage of missions together. During their deployment to Iraq, the pair conducted more than 250; in Afghanistan, 200.\n\nNow they live about an hour outside New Orleans, in Mandeville, La. Memories from the battlefield still haunt Harrington, though.\n\nThe Pentagon reports that more than 155,000 troops experience post-traumatic stress disorder, and each week about 1,000 Iraq and Afghanistan war veterans are diagnosed with PTSD. About 5 percent of military dogs used by combat forces present symptoms.\n\n>>> Commentary: America\u2019s Veterans Deserve Better: Five Priorities to Fix VA\n\nThe Humane Association and Mission K9 argue that reuniting veterans with their working dogs helps spur healing of the wounds of war.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t care who you are. Seeing what [our troops] see over there, what no one should see, they come back broken,\u201d Kristen Maurer, president of Mission K9, says.\n\nA handler\u2019s military dog \u201cwas with them day in and day out,\u201d Maurer says:\n\nThey protected the dog, the dog protected them in turn. And when they are reuniting with that dog, I see a piece being put back together. And I see a piece of their soul being healed. And you can see it, and you can hear it in their voice, and you can see it in their face. It\u2019s just, to me, the beginning of their healing process.\n\nHarrington, who does struggle with post-traumatic stress disorder, says having Ryky by his side is a better remedy than anything the Department of Veteran Affairs could offer.\n\n\u201cShe is my prescription,\u201d he says. \u201cShe helps me that way.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe is my prescription. She helps me that way,\u201d says Iraq War vet James Harrington of his military working dog, Ryky\n\nCrowded spaces and remaining in one area for too long can make Harrington anxious. Ryky helps him combat that.\n\nNow in training to be a service dog, Ryky has Harrington\u2019s back. Literally.\n\nShe will stand behind him to ensure no one gets too close. She will rub against him if someone comes within a certain distance. If Harrington remains in one place for \u201ctoo long,\u201d she\u2019ll press against him and the two will move to an open area.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s always going to keep an eye out for me,\u201d Harrington says. \u201cDogs don\u2019t have to physically see you; they know where you are at all times. It\u2019s a sixth sense-type thing.\u201d\n\nJames Carafano, a national security expert at The Heritage Foundation, is also president of Esprit de Corps, a non-profit that educates the public about veteran affairs. Carafano says that returning military working dogs to their handlers is invaluable:\n\nAt the very least, reuniting them with their partner seems a small step for a large sacrifice. And make no mistake, such an act of generosity and caring will mean as much to the soldier as it does to their companion. We always say we want to give back. This seems to me an honorable and compassionate way to do that.\n\nMission K9 and the Humane Association are raising money to pay to send retired military working dogs back to the United States. The two groups organize transportation to bring the dogs to an airport where a former handler or adopting family waits.\n\nIf Congress changes the language of the NDAA to require that the dogs not be retired until after they are returned to the U.S., the organizations intend to arrange for domestic transport and the reunions with handlers.\n\n\u201cWe just want to make sure they go to good homes,\u201d Harrington says, \u201cbecause that\u2019s what they deserve.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The military classifies its working dogs as equipment, and those \"retired\" while overseas aren't granted transport to the U.S. and reunion with handlers.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The military classifies its working dogs as equipment, and those \"retired\" while overseas aren't granted transport to the U.S. and reunion with handlers.", "title": "The Fight to Allow Military Working Dogs to 'Retire' on U.S. Soil", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/140811_MilitaryDogsHarrington.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-08-27T11:57:49+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1tuuDM3"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The military classifies its working dogs as equipment, and those \"retired\" while overseas aren't granted transport to the U.S. and reunion with handlers.", "creator": "@dailysignal", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/140811_MilitaryDogsHarrington.jpg"}, "title": "The Fight to Allow Military Working Dogs to 'Retire' on U.S. Soil", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Security", "tag": "military,veterans", "published_time": "2014-08-23T03:01:39+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-08-27T11:57:49+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "James Harrington, military working dogs, Mission K9 Rescue, Lackland Air Force Base, Gus Bilirakis, American Humane Association, Marsha Blackburn, contract working dogs"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd84e7\"", "article_summary": "But for military working dogs, the end of a career doesn\u2019t lead to a ride home on a military transport, Ganzert explains.\nUnder the legislation, retired military working dogs would be transferred to the 341st Training Squadron if \u201cno suitable adoption\u201d is available.\nOrganizations are lobbying Congress to change the official language defining military working dogs.\nMore than 2,500 military working dogs currently serve, roughly 500 deployed at a time.\nA rank typically is assigned to each military working dog \u2014 one higher than the dog\u2019s handler."}
