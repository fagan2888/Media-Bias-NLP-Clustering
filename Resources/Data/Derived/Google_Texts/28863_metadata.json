America believes in the future.\u201d\n\nThe president also questioned the ideological consistency of those who champion free-market solutions - except when the free market is pointing to the wisdom of renewable energy. He singled out billionaire brothers Charles and David Koch, who are major donors to Republican political candidates.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s one thing if you\u2019re consistent in being free market,\u201d Obama said. \u201cIt\u2019s another thing when you\u2019re free market until it\u2019s solar that\u2019s working and people want to buy and suddenly you\u2019re not for it anymore. That\u2019s a problem.\u201d\n\nObama said the economics are now such that \u201csolar isn\u2019t just for the green crowd any more, it\u2019s for the green-eyeshade crowd too.\u201d\n\nThe president compared those who say that shifting to cleaner energy will cripple the economy with climate change deniers who hold up snowballs in February to argue that \u201csomehow disproves decades of scientific data.\u201d\n\nFossil fuel and utility interests have been working at the state level and elsewhere to undercut clean energy policies with arguments that the matter should be left to the free market.\n\nThe annual energy conference was hosted by Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid. The Nevada senator frequently targets the Koch brothers, depicting them as self-serving oil barons who pay huge sums to try to buy elections and advance their agenda of low taxes and less regulation at the expense of average Americans.\n\nObama used his appearance to announce new executive actions and other efforts aimed at making it easier for homeowners and businesses to invest in green energy improvements that in the past may have been impractical or unaffordable.\n\nThe moves, which include expanding the use of energy improvement loans, are designed to build on the clean power plant rules that the president announced earlier in the month to cut carbon dioxide emissions from coal-fired power plants by a third. They all feed into Obama\u2019s goal of cutting overall U.S. emissions by 26 percent to 28 percent over the next decade to combat climate change and encourage other countries to do likewise.\n\nThe actions Obama announced Monday focused on giving families and businesses more say in what types and how much power they rely on. That could mean rooftop solar panels, once largely the province of committed environmentalists, or other renewable energy innovations.\n\nAhead of Obama\u2019s remarks, Housing Secretary Julian Castro said the plan \u201chits the sweet spot\u201d by making clean energy more affordable for people and protecting the environment. He said people too often have been \u201cpriced out\u201d of clean-energy options.\n\nHowever, Utah Republican Rep. Rob Bishop, chair of the House Committee on Natural Resources, said Obama\u2019s policies were leveling \u201cincreased costs and decreased choices on all Americans and especially the most disadvantaged communities.\u201d\n\nThe Heartland Institute, a conservative think tank that denies manmade climate change and gets money from the Koch brothers was among groups co-sponsoring a simultaneous \u201caffordable energy summit\u201d in Las Vegas as a counterpoint to Reid\u2019s gathering. The organization, which previously received money from ExxonMobil, maintains that Obama\u2019s policies promote wind and solar power at the expense of conventional energy and \u201cwill inevitably cause skyrocketing electricity prices while providing little if any net environmental benefits,\u201d according to the summit\u2019s website.\n\nObama also announced the approval of a transmission line to support a planned 485-megawatt solar plant planned for Riverside County in California. The Blythe Mesa plant is expected to produce enough renewable energy to power more than 145,000 homes.\n\nWhile in Nevada, Obama also attended an evening fundraiser at the home of Las Vegas Sun publisher and businessman Brian Greenspun benefiting the Nevada State Democratic Party.\n\nJust back from his Martha\u2019s Vineyard vacation, Obama told the Democratic donors he was feeling \u201crefreshed, renewed, recharged\u201d - and \u201ca little feisty.\u201d\n\nHe declared himself ready for the challenges he faces dealing with a Republican Congress that disagrees with him on the budget, energy policy and other issues.\n\nHe said the country needs not just \u201ca president who, after a few gray hairs, seems to know what he\u2019s doing, but we also need a Congress that functions.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Matthew Daly and Julie Pace in Washington contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nFollow Nancy Benac on Twitter at http://twitter.com/nbenac", "article_metadata": {"description": "President Barack Obama on Monday accused fossil fuel interests and other critics of his energy policies of trying to restrict consumers from accessing solar, wind and other renewable sources in order to protect the status quo.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "President Barack Obama on Monday accused fossil fuel interests and other critics of his energy policies of trying to restrict consumers from accessing solar, wind and other renewable sources in order to protect the status quo.", "title": "Obama calls out fossil fuel interests for fighting solar", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/aug/24/obama-pushing-for-more-clean-energy-choices-for-co/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/08/24/c5be8b2bd6a8f7257f0f6a706700adbf.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/08/24/c5be8b2bd6a8f7257f0f6a706700adbf.jpg", "description": "President Barack Obama on Monday accused fossil fuel interests and other critics of his energy policies of trying to restrict consumers from accessing solar, wind and other renewable sources in order", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Obama calls out fossil fuel interests for fighting solar"}, "Author": "NANCY BENAC", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb633\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThat\u2019s not the American way,\u201d Obama said in a speech at a green energy conference in Las Vegas.\nThat could mean rooftop solar panels, once largely the province of committed environmentalists, or other renewable energy innovations.\nLAS VEGAS (AP) - President Barack Obama on Monday accused fossil fuel interests and other critics of his energy policies of trying to restrict consumers from accessing solar, wind and other renewable sources in order to protect the status quo.\nThe Blythe Mesa plant is expected to produce enough renewable energy to power more than 145,000 homes.\nWhile in Nevada, Obama also attended an evening fundraiser at the home of Las Vegas Sun publisher and businessman Brian Greenspun benefiting the Nevada State Democratic Party."}
