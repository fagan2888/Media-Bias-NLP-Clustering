He\u2019s expected to detail the program in his fiscal 2016 budget, to be released Feb. 2.\n\nThe Obama administration views medical research as an area of health-care policy the Republican-led Congress may be willing to help advance, even as it fights the president over the continued implementation of Obamacare, his signature legislative accomplishment. Obama\u2019s health secretary, Sylvia Mathews Burwell, foreshadowed the precision medicine proposal in a speech last week that was conciliatory toward Republicans.\n\n\u201cThe promise precision medicine has is that it gives us the ability to develop medical treatments that are highly tailored to the individual characteristics of patients,\u201d she said in the Jan. 15 speech at the New America Foundation, an advocacy group in Washington. \u201cI hope we can work with the Congress to scale up the initial successes we have seen in this promising avenue of scientific endeavor.\u201d\n\nPrecision medicine relies on tests such as genetic sequencing to identify patients who will respond to drugs such as Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc.\u2019s Kalydeco for cystic fibrosis. Advances in such therapies have been helped by the dramatic drop off in costs for sequencing.\n\n$1,000 Sequencing\n\nSince the whole human genome was first deciphered in 2003 by the National Institutes of Health and J. Craig Venter\u2019s Celera Genomics, the cost of sequencing an entire genome has fallen rapidly to a few thousand dollars per patient, making it a viable tool for drugmakers to employ in research.\n\nThe White House hinted at Obama\u2019s proposal in announcing yesterday that Michelle Obama\u2019s guests at the State of the Union address will include a cystic fibrosis patient, Bill Elder, who has been successfully treated with Kalydeco, which targets mutations in a gene underlying the disease.\n\n\u201cHis story is a testament to the promise of precision medicine, an emerging approach to treatment that takes into account patients\u2019 individual characteristics, and a kind of research the president hopes to expand,\u201d the White House said in a blog post.\n\nGenome Project\n\nMore than 1,800 genetic links to disease have been identified since the Human Genome Project, according to the NIH, and there are more than 2,000 genetic tests for disease conditions.\n\nThe gene that Kalydeco targets was discovered in 1989 by Francis Collins and a team of researchers. Collins led the NIH\u2019s Human Genome Project and now leads the entire agency.\n\nGenes -- pieces of chemical code that contain instructions for building cells and tissues -- are mostly the same in all people. Small variations can lead to differences in hair or eye color. Some may cause disease, so understanding how one individual\u2019s genetic makeup differs from another could help scientists develop treatments.\n\n\u201cPrecision medicine means identifying the subset of patients who will be most likely to respond to a specific treatment,\u201d Raju Kucherlapati, a Harvard Medical School genetics professor, said in a telephone interview. \u201cOne of the best ways to do that is through genetics,\u201d he said, while other methods include blood tests and imaging.\n\nDisease Links\n\nResearchers have been creating and delving into large databases of detailed patient records to understand the links between individual characteristics, such as genetic variation, and disease. The ability to collect data from widespread sources has bolstered studies of relatively rare conditions, including cystic fibrosis, Huntington\u2019s disease and muscular dystrophy, said Kucherlapati, who has held an annual conference at Harvard on the topic for the last decade.\n\nKnowledge of the genetic drivers of a disease \u201callows you to put patients into smaller buckets,\u201d Cary Pfeffer, a partner at venture capital firm Third Rock Ventures, which helps start biotechnology companies, said in a Jan. 13 interview. This could lead to highly customized therapies that are tailored to individual patients, or that allow doctors to better select the right treatment from available off-the-shelf medicines, he said.\n\nThe potential of genetics as a tool in drug development spurred Roche Holding AG\u2019s Genentech unit to commit as much as $60 million this year to 23andMe Inc. in a deal to study the DNA of customers with Parkinson\u2019s disease.\n\nParkinson\u2019s Research\n\n23andMe will help Genentech gather patients with Parkinson\u2019s in the hope of sequencing the genome of about 3,000 individuals. 23andMe will also gather clinical information on the patients, such as their symptoms and activity level, which can help Genentech draw connections between someone\u2019s genomic profile and the way that person experiences Parkinson\u2019s.\n\n\u201cWith sequencing technology, we\u2019re now at the point where speed and costs have reached a point where it\u2019s feasible to sequence 3,000 people,\u201d Alex Schuth, head of technology innovation and diagnostics in business development at Roche\u2019s Genentech, said by telephone. \u201cWe also have computation power - - you get an enormous amount of information, which needs to be stored and communicated.\u201d\n\nA national precision medicine effort might help coordinate the work of researchers at large centers across the country in finding potential treatments for rare disorders, Harvard\u2019s Kucherlapati said. People suffering from more common ailments, like Alzheimer\u2019s disease, might be tested and separated into groups that will respond to specific treatments, he said.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Alex Wayne, Caroline Chen and John Lauerman", "twitter": {"description": "President Barack Obama will urge Congress to spend U.S. taxpayers\u2019 money for research in \u201cprecision medicine,\u201d a burgeoning field of care in which treatments are tailored to an individual patient.", "title": "Obama Proposes U.S. Spending to Research Personalized Cures", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-01-21/obama-to-propose-u-s-spending-to-research-personalized-cures", "image": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iewF8s8DXv68/v1/-1x-1.jpg", "site": "@business", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-author": "Alex Wayne, Caroline Chen and John Lauerman", "parsely-type": "post", "keywords": "Congress", "news_keywords": "Congress", "parsely-link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-01-21/obama-to-propose-u-s-spending-to-research-personalized-cures", "parsely-title": "Obama Proposes U.S. Spending to Research Personalized Cures", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ff0000", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "parsely-pub-date": "2015-01-21T02:01:02.083Z", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "description": "President Barack Obama will urge Congress to spend U.S. taxpayers\u2019 money for research in \u201cprecision medicine,\u201d a burgeoning field of care in which treatments are tailored to an individual patient.", "parsely-tags": "Congress,Region: Global,Page: article", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://assets.bwbx.io/business/public/images/favicons/mstile-144x144-bbd2101292.png", "date": "2015-01-21T02:01:02.083Z", "parsely-section": "science-energy", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "og": {"site_name": "Bloomberg.com", "description": "President Barack Obama will urge Congress to spend U.S. taxpayers\u2019 money for research in \u201cprecision medicine,\u201d a burgeoning field of care in which treatments are tailored to an individual patient.", "title": "Obama Proposes U.S. Spending to Research Personalized Cures", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-01-21/obama-to-propose-u-s-spending-to-research-personalized-cures", "image": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iewF8s8DXv68/v1/-1x-1.jpg", "type": "website"}, "fb": {"status": "President Barack Obama will urge Congress to spend U.S. taxpayers\u2019 money for research in \u201cprecision medicine,\u201d a burgeoning field of care in which treatments are tailored to an individual patient."}, "parsely-post-id": "NIHVJA6K50Y001", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "parsely-image-url": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iewF8s8DXv68/v1/-1x-1.jpg"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce800\"", "article_summary": "Obama\u2019s health secretary, Sylvia Mathews Burwell, foreshadowed the precision medicine proposal in a speech last week that was conciliatory toward Republicans.\nPresident Barack Obama will urge Congress to spend U.S. taxpayers\u2019 money for research in \u201cprecision medicine,\u201d a burgeoning field of care in which treatments are tailored to an individual patient.\nSome may cause disease, so understanding how one individual\u2019s genetic makeup differs from another could help scientists develop treatments.\nParkinson\u2019s Research23andMe will help Genentech gather patients with Parkinson\u2019s in the hope of sequencing the genome of about 3,000 individuals.\nThis could lead to highly customized therapies that are tailored to individual patients, or that allow doctors to better select the right treatment from available off-the-shelf medicines, he said."}
