She goes online mainly for email via her University of Minnesota account, so the classic system for accessing the Internet is all she needs.\n\nAnd if a mail attachment is taking a long time to download? \u201cThen I go away, and I come back later,\u201d the 92-year-old St. Paul resident said. \u201cIt will be there. I am not throwing money down a rathole.\u201d\n\nWatson is among a small but significant percentage of U.S. adults clinging to dial-up, even as broadband becomes ubiquitous and Internet files become increasingly data-heavy and complex.\n\nRoughly 70 percent of U.S. adults used broadband as of May, according to recently released figures from the Pew Internet & American Life Project. That\u2019s up from 66 percent in April 2012.\n\nYet about 3 percent still are on dial-up connections, Pew said. Another 10 percent primarily use smartphones for Internet access, which Pew doesn\u2019t classify as broadband but says is increasingly speedy and reliable.\n\nIn fact, dial-up usage has stayed at 3 percent since 2011 after dipping from 7 percent in 2009 and 5 percent in 2010, according to Pew, which recently released a \u201cHome Broadband 2013\u201d study based on a survey.\n\nAaron Smith, the study\u2019s author, said he can only speculate about why some U.S. adults have stayed with dial-up even as broadband has become faster and more affordable. Pew has not included questions about dial-up in its surveys since 2009 because of the small sample size.\n\nDuring the recent U.S. economic crisis, about a third of dial-up users told Pew that they regarded broadband as too pricey, and about 1 in 5 said nothing would get them off dial-up.\n\nBroadband availability was an issue, too. About 15 percent of surveyed dial-up users lacked it.\n\n\u201cA small but non-trivial number of people still use that type of connection, while most people haven\u2019t thought about dial-up for a number of years now,\u201d Smith said.\n\nOn the business side, dial-up remains a small but stable revenue source for a number of Twin Cities Internet-access providers. These ISPs, including ipHouse and VISI, earn the bulk of their income from data-center management and business hosting; they keep their dial-up gear running as an afterthought.\n\nDial-up is \u201ca small portion of the business, but we keep the (modems) running and we support them,\u201d said DeAnne Boegli, communications director for VISI\u2019s parent, TDS Communications.\n\n\u201cSome people just want email and do not want to participate in the greater online experience,\u201d Boegli said. \u201cIt\u2019s all about choice.\u201d\n\nVISI, based in St. Paul, fully intends to shutter its dial-up business at some point \u2014 while figuring out alternatives for its dial-up customers, Boegli added \u2014 but this isn\u2019t imminent.\n\nSome dial-up users might qualify for a low-cost Comcast cable-based broadband called Internet Essentials that is aimed at low-income families, notably those who have children in the National School Lunch Program.\n\nInternet Essentials costs about $10 a month with Internet speeds that are exponentially faster than dial-up, and users have the option to purchase an Internet-capable computer for $150, according to Comcast.\n\nDan Wood, an ipHouse network engineer, says dial-up remains a viable technology, and not just for penny-pinching, set-in-their-ways home users. It is useful for ecological sensors and other kinds of remote-sensing equipment that need Internet connections but can get by with slower, intermittent ones, he noted.\n\nThe ISP\u2019s residential dial-up business \u201cis not a moneymaker,\u201d added Wood, \u201cbut we still have plenty of users.\u201d\n\nMany of these want to keep email addresses they had long used with local ISPs, such as Bitstream Underground, that ipHouse has acquired over the years. The ISP also took over the University of Minnesota\u2019s dial-up users when the U shut down its own dial-up services.\n\nSome people have used dial-up \u201cfor decades and have never had to change anything,\u201d Wood said. \u201cIf it is set up correctly, and it works, there\u2019s no reason to fiddle with it.\u201d\n\nWatson is among those happily using decades-old University of Minnesota email accounts via ipHouse dial-up connections and makes changes to her computer setup only when necessary.\n\nShe used a kind of Apple all-in-one computer known as an eMac (a cousin to the better-known iMac) for a time but had to upgrade when the University of Minnesota switched its email users over to Google Gmail-based service and the eMac\u2019s Web browser couldn\u2019t keep up.\n\nNow she is using a flat-panel iMac purchased second-hand. Her phone line connects to a small dial-up modem that plugs into one of her Mac\u2019s USB ports, thereby affording her dial-up service for $100 a year. DSL, a slower kind of broadband, would run her $30 a month.\n\nNah, the onetime university of Minnesota communications instructor and radio-station manager, said. \u201cI\u2019m tempted, but I\u2019m reluctant to spend my money.\u201d\n\nLikewise, Ann McGinn of St. Paul tolerates her slow but affordable dial-up service even though emailed photos of her beloved 5-year-old granddaughter take a while to load.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m retired, and I\u2019m not going anywhere,\u201d the former attorney and journalist said.\n\nMcGinn, 75, is an online power user, after a fashion. She uses RSS, a system for keeping track of updates to her favorite sites via subscriptions or \u201cfeeds,\u201d consolidated in a \u201creader\u201d app called NetNewsWire.\n\nAll this information takes a while to download via her USB modem, but once it\u2019s on her old Apple MacBook laptop, she has a kind of digital newspaper to keep her updated on the latest in news, politics, economics and the like.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t get upset when it\u2019s slow because I\u2019m used to it,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s adequate for what I need.\u201d\n\nShe also interacts with others around the country via a forum focused on women\u2019s issues. It is another low-bandwidth activity that works well over her VISI dial-up, which runs about $21 a month.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s so much to see and read \u2026 slowly but surely,\u201d she said.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Dial-up isn\u2019t dead: Why some consumers are opting for lower Internet speeds", "title": "Dial-up isn\u2019t dead: Why some consumers are opting for lower Internet speeds", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2013/09/03/dial-up-isnt-dead-why-some-consumers-are-opting-for-lower-internet-speeds/", "image": {"width": 300, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20130903__32fddd98-affc-43ca-880c-686702cec47ap1.jpg", "height": 450}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20130903__32fddd98-affc-43ca-880c-686702cec47ap1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2013-09-03T10:57:14+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-28T16:26:00+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd821e\"", "article_summary": "She has used a dial-up Internet connection \u2014 the kind that requires dialing a phone number and achieving comparatively poky speeds \u2014 since 1992.\nThe ISP also took over the University of Minnesota\u2019s dial-up users when the U shut down its own dial-up services.\nRoughly 70 percent of U.S. adults used broadband as of May, according to recently released figures from the Pew Internet & American Life Project.\nSome people have used dial-up \u201cfor decades and have never had to change anything,\u201d Wood said.\nHer phone line connects to a small dial-up modem that plugs into one of her Mac\u2019s USB ports, thereby affording her dial-up service for $100 a year."}
