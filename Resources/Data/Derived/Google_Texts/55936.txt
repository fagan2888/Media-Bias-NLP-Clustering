During her radio show on Tuesday, right-wing pundit and frequent Fox News contributor Laura Ingraham continued to wage war against the slight possibility of America experiencing a humane and realistic debate about immigration reform by comparing President Obama to a perpetrator of domestic violence.

Returning to one of her favorite talking points, Ingraham expressed skepticism about the Obama administration’s claims to be deporting people in record numbers. Contrary to what people believe, Ingraham insisted, policy on the border between the United States and Mexico was characterized by the “willful refusal to enforce laws, across the board, evenly, as they are supposed to be enforced.”

Ingraham then transitioned to a criticism of Rep. Paul Ryan, who recently enraged many members of the anti-reform right by voicing his support for eventually granting legal status to undocumented immigrants.

“It was fun to hear from Paul Ryan, I think it was yesterday, when he was talking about another mandate being delayed in Obamacare, and he’s huffing and puffing about that,” Ingraham said. “Well, what do you think was gonna happen with immigration, Paul? What do you think the administration was going to do with all your new enforcement mechanisms?”

Ingraham went on to derisively mimic Ryan, listing all of the “enforcement mechanisms” the Republican congressman had promised would be part of a new round of immigration reform. “It’s going to be different this time,” she said, pretending to be Ryan.
