A group called the Satanic Temple unveiled the Baphomet statue during a private event on in a Detroit industrial building on Saturday, which people could attend starting at $25 dollars a ticket.\n\nIts location was kept secret by the group until the last minute to avoid public demonstrations planned for its unveiling, according to the Independent. Leading up to the statue\u2019s unveiling, the group also received messages from people threatening to burn the venue of the event down and blow up the statue, according to the Raw Story. In response, around 250 people attended mass Saturday morning at St. Joseph\u2019s Church in prayer for the city and in protest of the statue\u2019s unveiling, according to the Detroit News.\n\nfirst look at The Satanic Temple statute of Baphomet that was unveiled tonight in Detroit pic.twitter.com/17BhW1faNi Photo: Johan Ordonez/AFP/Getty Images \u2014 The Bearded One (@_Beard_Life) July 26, 2015\n\nThe Satanic Temple originally intended to unveil the statue in public, but the owner of the venue, Bert\u2019s Marketplace, returned the rental feel to the group after finding out about the statue unveiling.\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\nThe group unsuccessfully attempted to have the statue displayed near a monument of the Ten Commandments, which was located on state grounds of the Oklahoma Capitol. But in June, the state Supreme Court ruled that the display of the Ten Commandments -- or any religious statues on state grounds -- violated the state\u2019s constitution. The Satanic Temple claimed the move as a victory, according to the New York Times.\n\nFollowing the unveiling of the satanic statue, the group intends to place it outside the Arkansas Statehouse in Little Rock, the same location where another Ten Commandments monument is planned.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://s2.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/themes/us_ibtimes/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "satanic statue, satan statue, baphomet, church protests satan statue, satantic statue unveiling, baphomet photos, satanic statue photos, detroit satan statue, satanic temple, satanic temple statue, ten commandments", "og": {"site_name": "International Business Times", "description": "The satanic statue was unveiled on Saturday in a location that was kept secret from attendees until the last minute.", "title": "Goat-Headed Satanic Statue Unveiling Protested By Hundreds At Catholic Mass", "url": "http://www.ibtimes.com/goat-headed-satanic-statue-unveiling-protested-hundreds-catholic-mass-2025036", "image": "http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/2015/07/26/satan-statue.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The satanic statue was unveiled on Saturday in a location that was kept secret from attendees until the last minute.", "title": "Goat-Headed Satanic Statue Unveiling Protested By Hundreds At Catholic Mass", "url": "http://www.ibtimes.com/goat-headed-satanic-statue-unveiling-protested-hundreds-catholic-mass-2025036", "image": {"src": "http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/2015/07/26/satan-statue.jpg", "identifier": "http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/2015/07/26/satan-statue.jpg"}, "site": "@IBTimes", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#000000", "fb": {"app_id": 263851690471857, "pages": 128026713884051}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/themes/us_ibtimes/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/IBTimes", "section": "World", "published_time": "2015-07-26T18:21:08-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-07-26T18:21:08-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "The satanic statue was unveiled on Saturday in a location that was kept secret from attendees until the last minute."}, "article_summary": "Hundreds of people attended Mass at a Detroit Catholic Church in protest of an 8.5-foot bronze statue of goat-headed Satan that hundreds came to see, according to the Associated Press.\nIn response, around 250 people attended mass Saturday morning at St. Joseph\u2019s Church in prayer for the city and in protest of the statue\u2019s unveiling, according to the Detroit News.\nIts location was kept secret by the group until the last minute to avoid public demonstrations planned for its unveiling, according to the Independent.\nFollowing the unveiling of the satanic statue, the group intends to place it outside the Arkansas Statehouse in Little Rock, the same location where another Ten Commandments monument is planned.\nThe Satanic Temple claimed the move as a victory, according to the New York Times."}
