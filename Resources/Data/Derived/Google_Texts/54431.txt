When you meet a triple-amputee riding up Boulder Canyon two hours into your first day of Ride The Rockies, your on-bike challenges feel smaller.

Tim Brown, the 30-year-old former Marine, is pushing himself across Ride The Rockies’ six-day, 471-mile route with his left arm and his right shoulder. Regarding the Boulder Canyon climb, “Hills are actually my strong point,” Brown said. “I’m so light weight.”

His steed is a custom bike that took nine months to put together. Brown, who lives in Rockville, Maryland, started bicycling February 2012. Brown was injured (“blown up,” he said) on his third deployment in Afghanistan, in February 2011.

He picked up bicycling as a means of exercise. Swimming wasn’t an option, he said.

“It’s tough, but it’s a great way to deal with stress,” Brown said. That’s not to mention the physical benefits: “You get in shape, and chicks like you more when you’re in shape.”

He’s with two other riders on this trip, all Ride The Rockies first-timers.

Fast forward to day three, a ride looping to the west of Steamboat Springs. It’s the shortest day yet of the ride at 54 miles and 3,831′ of elevation gain.

Here are photos from today’s seven-hour ride.
