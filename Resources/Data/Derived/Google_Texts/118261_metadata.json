Bailey missed Monday\u2019s practice, but he provided an update on the condition of his foot, which has kept him out of action for the last two weeks.\n\nHis status remains very much in question for Thursday\u2019s game.\n\nBroncos coach John Fox did not add details to Bailey\u2019s situation.\n\n\u201cOur final injury report comes out tomorrow, and we\u2019ll leave it at that,\u201d Fox said.\n\nMeanwhile, guard Chris Kuper (ankle) has been a limited participant on Monday and Tuesday.\n\nFox did talk about the practice week leading up to the game, calling it \u201cexcellent.\u201d\n\nSaid Fox: \u201cThe guys have been focused and understandably so. It\u2019s the start of the new season.
