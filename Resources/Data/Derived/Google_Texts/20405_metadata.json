We weren\u2019t focused on what we needed to do from an offensive standpoint,\u201d Wittman said.\n\n\u201cComing out of timeouts, a guy doesn\u2019t even know he\u2019s supposed to catch the ball, and we turn it over.\u201d\n\nWall agreed.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s terrible,\u201d the point guard said.\n\nAsked whether the players or Wittman were at fault, Wall answered: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t put it on the coach, because he\u2019s doing a great job of drawing it up. \u2026 Like he always says, if you don\u2019t know, you\u2019ve got time before you walk on the court to ask again. So, it\u2019s all on us as players.\u201d\n\nThe Wizards are fifth in the Eastern Conference and still had a chance to end Sunday with a guaranteed place in the postseason, depending on results of later games. But they dropped 2 1/2 games behind No. 4 seed Toronto and, with eight games remaining, they can\u2019t wind up with 50 victories.\n\n\u201cWe show a sense of urgency one game, and another game, we take it off,\u201d Wall said. \u201cTo be where we want to be and go as far as we did last year, we have to turn it around or \u2026 we\u2019ll be done quick.\u201d\n\nHouston entered the day third in the Western Conference, a half-game behind No. 2 Memphis, and the Rockets\u2018 biggest concern is having enough players ready to go in the playoffs.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s nice to win the games, but it would be really nice to get healthy. That\u2019s our biggest thing,\u201d said coach Kevin McHale, who noted that Howard will sit out Monday against Toronto in the second game of a back-to-back set, and also made a passing reference to Patrick Beverley perhaps missing the rest of the season.\n\nCorey Brewer scored 15 points for Houston, including pairing with Pablo Prigioni for consecutive 3-pointers that pushed the lead back up to 85-75 with eight minutes left after Washington had pulled within four.\n\nHarden only made seven of 20 shots, but went 9-for-10 at the foul line. He added six assists and had an into-the-stands block of Beal\u2019s 3-point try with 25 seconds left.\n\n\u201cI was surprised he got up there. He\u2019s not known for blocking shots,\u201d Howard said. \u201cThat\u2019s what MVPs do.\u201d\n\nPorter, the No. 3 overall pick in the 2013 draft, added six rebounds for the Wizards. He replaced Paul Pierce, who shot 1-for-6 and had two points.\n\n\u201cHe might not have his legs as much as we need,\u201d Wall said about Pierce, \u201cso he might need to take a game or two off.\u201d\n\nTrevor Ariza, who left Washington after last season, contributed 13 points and eight rebounds.\n\nThree of the Wizards\u2018 reserves were missing \u2014 Kris Humphries and Garrett Temple were sidelined with injuries, while DeJuan Blair was out for personal reasons.", "article_metadata": {"description": "One game after clinching a playoff berth, the Rockets delayed the Wizards' bid to secure their own spot, beating their opponent 99-91 on Sunday behind Harden's 24 points.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "One game after clinching a playoff berth, the Rockets delayed the Wizards\u2019 bid to secure their own spot, beating their opponent 99-91 on Sunday behind Harden\u2019s 24 points.", "title": "James Harden helps Rockets prevent Wizards from clinching playoff spot", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/mar/29/james-hardens-24-points-lead-surging-rockets-over-/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/03/29/Rockets_Wizards_Basketball_.JPEG-03f3a.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/03/29/Rockets_Wizards_Basketball_.JPEG-03f3a.jpg", "description": "One game after clinching a playoff berth, the Rockets delayed the Wizards' bid to secure their own spot, beating their opponent 99-91 on Sunday behind Harden's 24 points.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "James Harden helps Rockets prevent Wizards from clinching playoff spot"}, "Author": "Howard Fendrich", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Sports, Washington Wizards, John Wall, Dwight Howard, Otto Porter"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca94b\"", "article_summary": "James Harden scored 24 points, and Dwight Howard had 11 points and 10 rebounds over 19 minutes, playing in his third game back from a right knee injury, for the Rockets (50-23).\n\u201cWe show a sense of urgency one game, and another game, we take it off,\u201d Wall said.\nLosing for the fifth time in six games, which delayed their bid to secure a postseason berth, the Wizards were beaten, 99-91, on Sunday by the Houston Rockets.\nThey can\u2019t even seem to run plays properly right after coach Randy Wittman draws them up during a timeout.\nThree of the Wizards\u2018 reserves were missing \u2014 Kris Humphries and Garrett Temple were sidelined with injuries, while DeJuan Blair was out for personal reasons."}
