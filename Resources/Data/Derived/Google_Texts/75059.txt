Eddyville, KY

Federal authorities have arrived at the scene of a Kentucky plane crash that a seven-year-old girl survived after it killed four members of her family.



Kentucky State Police Sgt. Dean Patterson says Federal Aviation Administration officials have arrived, and investigators with the National Transportation Safety board also were expected to get to the scene on Saturday.



The FAA says a small Piper PA-34 reported engine trouble and lost contact with air traffic controllers as it was flying over the southwestern part of Kentucky late Friday afternoon.



About a half hour later, a Lyon County resident called 911 and told dispatchers that a seven-year-old girl had walked to his home and said she had been involved in a plane crash.



The girl has been released from a hospital.
