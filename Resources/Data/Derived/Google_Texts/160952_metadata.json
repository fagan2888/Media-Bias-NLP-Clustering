For the best female jumpers in the world, Feb. 11 will be a momentous day after years of fighting for the right to compete, including an unsuccessful court case to be included in Vancouver four years ago.\n\nThe International Olympic Committee finally decided in April 2011 to add women\u2019s jumping to the Sochi program. The delay can be partly blamed on Eddie \u201cThe Eagle\u201d Edwards, whose terrible form and questionable bravado at the 1988 Calgary Games. That brought the wrong kind of publicity to the sport and persuaded the governing body to introduce tougher qualifying restrictions, which ultimately affected female jumpers. The growth in elite women\u2019s jumping was evident in the first women\u2019s World Cup event of the season in December at Lillehammer, Norway, when 70 female jumpers from 15 countries \u2014 the largest start list ever \u2014 competed.\n\nHere are five things to know about the event at the RusSki Gorki Jumping Center at the Mountain Cluster east of Sochi:\n\nWHY SO LONG? Female ski jumpers have heard all the excuses about why they weren\u2019t allowed into the Olympics sooner, including not having enough elite jumpers. But they were also told the female body wasn\u2019t thought to be strong enough to take the strain of repeated jumps, and even that it might affect their ability to have children. Former world champion Lindsay Van of the United States said she had people ask if her uterus had fallen out as a result of ski jumping. Van and Jessica Jerome were among the top competitors who filed the unsuccessful suit ahead of the 2010 Vancouver Olympics. \u201cI didn\u2019t see it as something noble, I saw it more as a moral responsibility,\u201d Jerome said at a media summit last year. The lawsuit failed, with a Canadian court ruling that the IOC, not Vancouver organizers, was the only body authorized to make the call. But the case generated widespread attention.\n\nKID BALLERINA IS BIG FAVORITE: Despite her small stature \u2014 she\u2019s 4 feet, 11 inches tall \u2014 Japan\u2019s Sara Takanashi is one of the biggest gold-medal favorites in any sport heading into Sochi. The 17-year-old Takanashi has won eight of nine World Cup events this season and is a runaway leader in the standings. Takanashi, who graduated from high school in 2012, credits ballet lessons as a child with helping her maintain balance during her jumps. \u201cThe Olympics in Sochi are my big goal,\u201d Takanashi said at a World Cup meet last year. \u201cTo fulfil my dream about a gold medal would be a huge success, but I will be glad about any position near the top.\u201d\n\nTHE COMEBACK: Perhaps the only credible threat to Takanashi\u2019s supremacy could come from American teenager Sarah Hendrickson, if she has recovered sufficiently from knee surgery. Hendrickson beat Takanashi at last year\u2019s world championships but tore her anterior cruciate ligament in August and has been fighting to be fit for Sochi ever since. Hendrickson only returned to jumping this week, but has been included in the U.S. team for Sochi. \u201cThe feeling of that first jump back was one of the best sensations in the entire world,\u201d Hendrickson said. \u201cOn the second jump, I let go of the bar and felt completely comfortable. All my nerves simply disappeared. My knee feels very good considering the situation.\u201d Van and Jessica Jerome also will be on the American team.\n\nONE SHOT: While the men\u2019s ski jumpers have three shots at a medal \u2014 two individual competitions and a team event \u2014 the women only get one chance. The women only compete on the normal hill \u2014 90 meters long \u2014 whereas the men also have an individual competition on a larger 120-meter hill. While there have been mixed team events on the World Cup \u2014 with two men and two women on each team \u2014 that format is not on the schedule for Sochi.\n\nTHE FORMAT: The competition is held over two rounds, with the top 30 advancing to the second jump. The winner is determined by points, not purely on the length of the jump, with the total score a combination of distance and style. The competitors start with 60 points and receive two points for every meter jumped beyond 95 meters and two deducted for every meter under 95. There are five judges, with the best and worst scores thrown out, and the other three scores added together to determine a style score.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Women's ski jumping will finally make its Olympic debut in Sochi \u2014 90 years after the men competed in the sport for the first time at the Winter Games.
