Disney Junior will introduce ‘Muppet Moments,’ an entirely new short-form series, to Disney Junior beginning April 3, 2015. The new series will feature the Muppets interacting with young children, discussing ordinary, every day topics, like ‘apologies, favorite foods, Obamacare and manners’ — well, three out of four anyway.

To celebrate the announcement, two videos have been released. The first talks about the series itself, while the second features the Muppets in some never-before-seen audition tapes as they try out for some of the more popular and well-known roles of programs currently featured on the channel.

‘Muppet Moments’ will debut on Disney Junior on Friday, April 3 at 8:25 am, 8:55 am, 9:25 am and 9:55 am ET/PT, followed by a new short daily through Friday, May 8. New shorts will continue to debut throughout 2015 and will also be available on the WATCH Disney Junior app.

UPDATE: Disney Junior has also released this excerpt from the upcoming series, titled ‘Let’s Eat’
