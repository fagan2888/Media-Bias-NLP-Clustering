The goal is to ease demand on Venezuela\u2019s power grid.\n\nWilliam Murray, chairman of the Religious Freedom Coalition in Washington, D.C., has studied centrally planned societies, recently writing a book called \u201cUtopian Road to Hell: Enslaving America and the World with Central Planning.\u201d He believes he knows what the real problem is.\n\n\u201cThe reason that there\u2019s an electricity shortage, a power shortage, in Venezuela is because power in Venezuela is supplied in the same way that Bernie Sanders wants to supply education and medicine in the United States \u2013 free of charge,\u201d Murray told WND. \u201cThere is no charge for electricity in Venezuela.\u201d\n\nAccording to Bloomberg, the Venezuelan government has rationed electricity and water for months and encouraged citizens to avoid waste. Venezuela is in the midst of a prolonged drought that has reduced output at hydroelectric dams, which supply the majority of the country\u2019s power.\n\nBut rationing is pointless if electricity is freely available, Murray noted.\n\n\u201cIt is considered a right of the people to get power, and because of that, there\u2019s no way to ration it other than for the government to cut it off and tell people they can\u2019t have it,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you don\u2019t pay for something, if you have no skin in the game, if you have absolutely no money coming out of your pocket for the price of the goods you\u2019re receiving, you\u2019re not going to limit yourself in what you\u2019re going to receive.\u201d\n\nVenezuela indeed has taken drastic measures to try and limit the amount of electricity the population uses. Last month, the government ordered more than 250 shopping malls to eschew electrical power from 1 p.m. to 3 p.m. and 7 p.m. to 9 p.m. for the next three months. Most malls, unable to find an alternate power source, have been closing down during those time slots.\n\nYahoo News reported Venezuelan companies are largely unable to import the necessary equipment to generate their own power because the government enforces strict capital controls that have led to a shortage of foreign currency.\n\nElectricity rationing is nothing new to Venezuela. In April 2015 the government implemented a rationing plan to try and counter a surge in demand due to rising temperatures. Officials cut the workday for public officials to six hours, asked private companies to increase energy efficiency and inspected malls and factories to ensure they met reduced power consumption goals.\n\nAn article in the Guardian written at the time admitted, \u201cThe country\u2019s average annual consumption per household is 5,878 kilowatt-hours, double the average of the region owing largely to sizable subsidies that allow consumers to run air conditioners with little regard to cost.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s the problem with a socialist system, according to Murray.\n\n\u201cWhen you have a subsidized government such as this where things are centrally planned and they decide what the people need and how much the people should pay rather than it being determined by how much the product cost to produce, this is the problem that you have,\u201d he said.\n\nNaturally, the socialist regime in Venezuela has blamed the electricity crisis on changing weather patterns that caused a drought and on \u201csabotage\u201d by political enemies. Critics, meanwhile, have blamed Maduro\u2019s administration for failing to anticipate the problem and not investing enough in the country\u2019s power grid.\n\nMurray believes the critics are closer to the truth.\n\n\u201cThe true problem here is that there\u2019s no money to build the infrastructure because they don\u2019t charge for the product,\u201d Murray explained. \u201cThat\u2019s the problem, and they can blame weather patterns, they can blame whatever they want, but the thing is they have been forced to cut off power now for more than a decade because the infrastructure\u2019s collapsing, nothing new is being built, nothing is being repaired.\u201d\n\nAs Murray alluded, Venezuela has suffered a number of electricity crises over the past several years. In 2010, for example, then-President Hugo Chavez added three days to the Easter week holiday to try and conserve power, just like Maduro did this year. Three years later, widespread blackouts led to numerous complaints and protests around the country.\n\nThe solution to these frequent crises is simple, according to Murray, and it involves embracing the free market.\n\n\u201cIf they want to fix the power situation in Venezuela, all they need to do is charge for it,\u201d he reasoned. \u201cNow I know that seems like an unusual or extreme thing, but we have cities in this country, and Detroit is an example, where they\u2019re saying people should not have to pay their water bills, that this is a right and if they\u2019re behind on their water bill, that doesn\u2019t mean they should have to pay for it, that somehow they should be able to have this free. And you cannot have consumable products delivered for free. The resources simply aren\u2019t there, and people are not \u2013 are not \u2013 going to limit themselves in what they get.\u201d\n\nMurray said electricity crises are not nearly as frequent in the United States because the free enterprise system is more flexible than socialism.\n\n\u201cThe free enterprise system can produce more of something when there\u2019s a shortage, and a socialist system can\u2019t because they have to produce these plans of a few individuals who think what\u2019s going to be needed, and very rarely are they correct,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Free Press For A Free People Since 1997", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.1", "og": {"site_name": "WND", "description": "Venezuelans will \u201cenjoy\u201d an extended Easter holiday next week as a worsening electricity shortage has forced the government to shut down the country for five days.
