In reality, the insurance companies have lost so much money on ACA-related claims that they\u2019re shrinking or outright killing their marketplace provider networks to recoup their losses. Your preferred doctor or specialist or hospital may be dropped. That\u2019s why that line of copy is there, and UT Southwestern argues that there\u2019s simply not much it can do at this point to change it. Come December 31, 2015, its hospitals and clinics won\u2019t be in network for plans purchased on the marketplace this enrollment period.\n\n\u201cWhen we get offered a rate that is less than Medicaid, it\u2019s hard to participate,\u201d says Dr. Bruce Meyer, the executive vice president for Health System Affairs at UT Southwestern. \u201cI don\u2019t know about other health systems in the region, but I know because of our relationship with Texas Health Resources that they were in the same plans that we were in that have been cancelled. It\u2019s much broader than UT Southwestern.\u201d\n\nUTSW notes that Blue Cross Blue Shield of Texas, the state\u2019s largest insurer, killed its PPO exchange plans. Cigna nixed its, too. Assurant Health\u2019s has vanished. Most, if not all, of Texas\u2019 insurance companies have switched their ACA offerings to HMOs, or Health Maintenance Organizations, to rein in spending. HMOs are much narrower than PPOs (Preferred Provider Organizations), which have a broader variety of specialists and care settings to choose from. With those PPOs gone, many providers have been dropped from plans on the marketplace. So that\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing, Meyer argues.\n\n\u201cAll of the plans, literally, that we have been participating with were cancelled by the various insurance companies. And that happened relatively recently, like the middle of October,\u201d Meyer says. \u201cWe\u2019re negotiating with them to get into plans, but for some plans we\u2019ve been told that they just won\u2019t put us in, that they want to keep it a very narrow network and they don\u2019t want to have us in it. Well, OK, I\u2019m happy to put up our data about the total cost of care, but it is what it is.\u201d\n\nNikki Mitchell, a spokeswoman for Baylor Scott & White Health, says its hospitals were also part of BCBSTX\u2019s since-departed PPO plan. She sent over a document that states plainly: \u201c Almost all \u201d\u2014emphasis theirs\u2014\u201cBSWH facilities will be out-of-network for any Blue Cross plan sold on the exchange.\u201d\n\nIn June, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Texas reported losing $400 million in 2014 because it paid out for more Obamacare claims than it brought in via premiums. To recoup, it asked the state to hike its rates. In July, the Richardson-based insurer announced that it would be outright shedding PPO plans during this enrollment period.\n\n\u201cWhen the Health Insurance Marketplace opened, we went \u2018all in,\u2019 making a calculated risk to offer individual PPO and HMO products in all 254 counties\u2013a commitment that no other Texas insurer was willing to make,\u201d wrote Dr. Dan McCoy, BCBSTX\u2019s chief medical officer, in an editorial published this week on D Healthcare Daily. (He wasn\u2019t available to chat Thursday.) \u201cWhile we know the discontinuance of our PPO product for individuals will be disruptive, it is clear that keeping the individual PPO policies would limit our ability to provide sustainable coverage to all of our members over time.\u201d\n\nYou\u2019re seeing the effects of these decisions throughout the state. Look to Houston, where the new insurance plans have dropped one of the premiere cancer treatment centers in the world, M.D. Anderson. To get treatment there under the HMO plans, patients will have to pay about 20 percent more for these now out-of-network services. Meyer says the rates being offered to UT Southwestern\u2019s clinics and hospitals through these HMO plans are financially untenable.\n\n\u201cThe state requires us to be a viable financial enterprise,\u201d he says. \u201cWe have to show that we can maintain financial viability. Some of the plans we\u2019ve been offered simply don\u2019t do that.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"com.silverpop.brandeddomains": "www.pages05.net,dhome.dmagazine.com,directory.dmagazine.com,dmagazine.com,dmagazine.mkt5665.com,frontburner.dmagazine.com,frontrow.dmagazine.com,healthcare.dmagazine.com,realestate.dmagazine.com,sidedish.dmagazine.com,stylesheet.dmagazine.com", "description": "Earlier this week, Wylie H. shared an interesting Facebook post from a UT Southwestern patient that culled this paragraph of text from the medical institution\u2019s", "og": {"site_name": "FrontBurner", "description": "Earlier this week, Wylie H. shared an interesting Facebook post from a UT Southwestern patient that culled this paragraph of text from the medical institution\u2019s website: \u201cIf you plan to obtain coverage through this option, please note that UT Southwestern University Hospitals and Clinics will not be contracted with any of the insurance plans currently available through the Affordable Care Act Health Insurance Marketplace during the 2016 calendar year.\u201d On its face, it may look like UT Southwestern is attempting to opt out of caring for patients who purchased Obamacare.
