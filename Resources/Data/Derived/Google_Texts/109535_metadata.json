During a live press conference, Brantly revealed that his colleague, Nancy Writebol, had been released on Tuesday. Though the world would like to credit the pair\u2019s recovery to treatment with the experimental ZMapp serum, experts urge it\u2019s too soon to say if the drug played any part at all in the healing process.\n\nBrantly and Writebol\u2019s release was a result of two back-to-back negative blood tests for Ebola, proving they no longer had any strains of the virus in their system. During the televised press conference, Dr. Bruce Ribner, medical director of the Emory University Hospital\u2019s Infectious Disease Unit, announced that he expected the patients to make a full recovery in due time, but as of now they pose \u201cno public health threat.\u201d\n\nIn his first public appearance since falling ill with the Ebola virus 31 days ago, Brantly addressed the media with a statement of gratitude, explaining how he was \u201cthrilled to be alive, to be well, and to be reunited with [his] family.\u201d In his emotional statement, the doctor also reminded the media that while he and Writebol were fully healed, the outbreak in West Africa was far from over. \u201cI encourage those in positions of leadership and influence to do whatever possible to bring this Ebola outbreak to an end,\u201d urged a well but still fragile-looking Brantly.\n\nIt is now confirmed that the patients are fully healed of the Ebola virus, but what lead to their recovery is more opaque. \u201cWe have no idea,\u201d said Ribner in response to a journalist questioning whether or not ZMapp played a role. \u201cThey were the very first individuals to ever receive this agent. Frankly, we do not know whether it helped them, whether it made no difference, or, theoretically, whether it delayed their recovery.\u201d Rather than credit ZMapp, Ribner suggested that the recovery was largely due to the care administered at Emory University Hospital. \u201cWe have no idea [if the drug helped], but even going into this, we knew that the key to resolving the Ebola virus infection was aggressive supportive care and we knew certainly we could do that at a better level than the facilities they were at in Liberia,\u201d Ribner said.\n\nThe FDA, as well as other companies, are currently working to speed up studies into possible Ebola drug treatments, but Ribner was not able to comment on any specific drug candidate, adding only that \u201cwe\u2019ve looked at a variety of agents that may be available.\u201d Still, even without proving the success of ZMapp, information learned from Brantly and Writebol\u2019s cases has done much to help advance science\u2019s understanding of the Ebola virus. At the moment, a number of doctors are working on writing medical journals on Brantly and Writebol\u2019s care with the hopes of distributing the information to colleagues in Africa.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "us, ebola, patients, kent, brantly, and, nancy, writebol, released, after, isolation, doctors", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Though doctors were mum on the success of the experimental ZMapp serum, American Ebola patient Dr. Kent Brantly spoke for the first time after being released from the isolation.", "title": "US Ebola Patients Released, But Why Are Doctors Hesitant To Credit ZMapp As A Cure?", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/us-ebola-patients-kent-brantly-and-nancy-writebol-released-after-isolation-doctors-299138", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/21/dr-kent-brantly.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Though doctors were mum on the success of the experimental ZMapp serum, American Ebola patient Dr. Kent Brantly spoke for the first time after being released from the isolation.", "title": "US Ebola Patients Released, But Why Are Doctors Hesitant To Credit ZMapp As A Cure?", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/us-ebola-patients-kent-brantly-and-nancy-writebol-released-after-isolation-doctors-299138", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/21/dr-kent-brantly.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/21/dr-kent-brantly.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Conditions", "published_time": "2014-08-21T13:27:14-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-08-21T13:41:33-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Though doctors were mum on the success of the experimental ZMapp serum, American Ebola patient Dr. Kent Brantly spoke for the first time after being released from the isolation."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2787\"", "article_summary": "After being kept in isolation for nearly three weeks for Ebola virus treatment, Dr. Kent Brantly was discharged from Emory University Hospital in Atlanta, Ga., early Thursday.\nIt is now confirmed that the patients are fully healed of the Ebola virus, but what lead to their recovery is more opaque.\nDuring a live press conference, Brantly revealed that his colleague, Nancy Writebol, had been released on Tuesday.\n\u201cWe have no idea,\u201d said Ribner in response to a journalist questioning whether or not ZMapp played a role.\nAt the moment, a number of doctors are working on writing medical journals on Brantly and Writebol\u2019s care with the hopes of distributing the information to colleagues in Africa."}
