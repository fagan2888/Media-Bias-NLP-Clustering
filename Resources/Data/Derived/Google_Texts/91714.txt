TBS’ Conan O’Brien spent some time Thursday night taking aim at fellow Turner Broadcasting property CNN over the cable news network’s “over-the-top” and “insane” coverage of the Ebola outbreak. This phenomenon was brought into sharp focus when O’Brien’s sidekick Andy Richter sneezed and CNN broke in with full breaking news coverage of the incident.



What followed was an elaborate “instant reaction” to the sneeze, complete with incessant slow-motion replays and interviews with various experts and bystanders, including the host himself, “Conrad O’Brium.”
