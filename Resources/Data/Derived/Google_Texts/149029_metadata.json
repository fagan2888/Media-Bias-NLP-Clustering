Angela Giron, will run for Pueblo County clerk and recorder.\n\n\u201cSeeing how apathetic our clerk was during the whole recall process was eye opening,\u201d said Head, referring to current Democratic Pueblo Clerk Gilbert Ortiz, who has served two terms. \u201cWe need better leadership.\u201d\n\nHead, a Republican, plans to file the necessary paperwork on Monday and will have an official campaign kickoff Tuesday morning at the Pueblo County Courthouse.\n\nGiron, a Democrat, was the subject of a recall for her support of tougher gun-control laws passed last year. Senate District 3 leans heavily in favor of Democrats, but still, more than 55 percent of voters in the special election opted to oust Giron from office.\n\nThe recall of Giron cost Pueblo taxpayers about $270,000. Millions of dollars were spent by outside groups in an effort to save Giron and her colleague, Senate President John Morse of Colorado Springs, who was also ousted in a recall election.\n\nHead and his fellow organizers with Pueblo Freedom and Rights collected more than 13,400 signatures and needed to have 11,300 verified to force the special election. Only about 6 percent of the signatures submitted in Giron\u2019s recall effort were deemed invalid because in real time Head utilized the secretary of state\u2019s website to make sure voters lived in the district and were registered.\n\n\u201cFrom the smartphones, we had the secretary of state\u2019s voter registration website locked in and at the ready,\u201d Head said at the time. \u201cIn 30 seconds, we were able to punch in a name, ZIP code and birth date and confirm that people signing were actually registered and lived in the district. We even registered some people that wanted to sign.\u201d\n\nFollow Kurtis on Twitter: @kurtisalee\n\n", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Gilbert Ortiz,gun control,John Morse,Pueblo County Clerk and recorder,Pueblo Freedom and Rights,recall,Sen.
