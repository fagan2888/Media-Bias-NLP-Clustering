Since 2010 the reductions have amounted to $1 billion a year while costing the government $8 billion it could have redeemed through enforcing compliance with tax laws, he said.\n\n\u201cI don't know any organization in my 20 years of experience in the private sector that has said \u2018I think I'll take my revenue operation and starve it for funds to see how it does,\u2019 \u201d Koskinen said in his prepared testimony. \u201cThe IRS will have 11,000 fewer people working during this upcoming filing season while processing the largest number of returns in its history.\u201d\n\nKoskinen also praised the 95,000 IRS employees for their experience and \u201cgreat tradition of public service\u201d and pledged, if confirmed, to \u201ccreate a working environment that allows employees to reach full their potential.\u201d Good management, he said, requires that the IRS chief \u201clisten to employees and see them not as part of the problem but part of a solution.\u201d Employees are the ones who know the problems and the ones who will go out and execute the solutions, Koskinen added. \u201cI want to create a system where information flows freely, across silos,\u201d he said. \u201cConsistent messaging and participation, I have found, energizes people.\u201d\n\nThe nominee referenced his other \u201cbest friends\u201d in the inspector general\u2019s office and Government Accountability Office as well as the National Taxpayer Advocate and the IRS whistleblower office. He promised to look for important patterns in congressional inquiries -- one of the sore points among lawmakers that emerged during this spring\u2019s IRS controversies.\n\nKoskinen declined to take a position -- pending receipt of public comments -- on the Treasury Department and IRS\u2019 recent proposed rule to clarify criteria for determining whether social welfare nonprofits are devoting too much of their agenda to politics. Hatch complained that the proposal released early this month \u201chammers social welfare groups but lets unions slip by,\u201d while Baucus called the proposal a \u201cpositive step.\u201d The nominee said that, \u201cOverall, what is needed is clarity for all organizations so that in the future they know what they can do to be comfortable\u201d they\u2019re within the law.\n\nThough both the top senators said they expect Koskinen to be confirmed, Hatch had hoped the confirmation hearing could have been postponed until the committee\u2019s investigation of the targeting problem was complete. Baucus said \u201cit\u2019s time to move\u201d because filing season is approaching and the IRS has been without a permanent commissioner for more than a year.\n\nAfter being interrupted for floor votes, the hearing was cut short because Republicans invoked a rule allowing them to object to having such a hearing within two hours of the Senate returning from a recess. So Baucus recessed the hearing \u201cuntil the appropriate time.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Charles S.
