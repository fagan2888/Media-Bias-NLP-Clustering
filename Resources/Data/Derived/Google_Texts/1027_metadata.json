Smith \u2014 UIC Alumni magazine\n\nWhen the Affordable Care Act was established in 2010, Dan Yunker accepted the challenge.\n\nYunker, who has spent most of his 25-year professional career in the health care industry, understood that consumers would face an uncertain health care environment.\n\nAs senior vice president and chief financial officer of the Metropolitan Chicago Healthcare Council, he envisioned a solution that would reshape consumers\u2019 existing relationship with health care. In 2012, the council launched Land of Lincoln Health, Illinois\u2019 first consumer-oriented and operated health insurance plan.\n\n\u201cI felt so strongly about this issue that I wasn\u2019t willing to let go, especially knowing how many lives this could impact,\u201d says Yunker, a 1992 graduate in psychology in the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences.\n\nYunker received the 2015 UIC City Partner Award Sept. 18, presented by UIC Chancellor Michael Amiridis.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been like building a plane while in flight, but we knew this was the right thing to do,\u201d Yunker says of the three-year-old insurance program. \u201cWe\u2019re making a difference and impacting lives.\u201d\n\n\u2018Patients are the ones who benefit\u2019\n\nOn the local health care scene, Yunker has a reputation as a game-changing leader. John DeNardo, director of UIC\u2019s master of healthcare administration program, calls him a \u201cdistinguished, innovative forward thinker\u201d with \u201chis finger on the pulse of the changing health care landscape.\u201d\n\nYunker has been at the Metropolitan Chicago Healthcare Council for the last decade, the past year as president and CEO. He has worked to exchange local health care\u2019s long-standing competitiveness for collaboration.\n\nYunker spearheaded the MetroChicago Health Information Exchange, which allows Chicago-area health care institutions to securely share patient data so that health care professionals can more quickly treat patients.\n\n\u201cThis was less about connecting via technology and more about removing local competitive politics,\u201d Yunker says. \u201cAnd patients are the ones who benefit.\u201d\n\nYunker orchestrated the creation of the Center for Advancing Provider Practices, which allows hospitals to better manage their advance-practice registered nurses and physician assistants.\n\nHe assisted in developing the Wage Index Review, which helped Chicago-area providers secure $250 million in Medicare reimbursement that the region would have otherwise lost.\n\nAs a lecturer in the UIC School of Public Health since 2012, Yunker shares his in-depth knowledge of health care finance with students. He has placed several at Metropolitan Chicago Healthcare Council and Land of Lincoln Health.\n\n\u201cI hope my students leave equipped to succeed and contribute to the health care field and ready to help their organizations fulfill their missions,\u201d he says.\n\nIf they do, Yunker will have created a ripple effect that impacts Chicago and beyond.\n\n\u201cAnd that would be something, wouldn\u2019t it?\u201d he says.", "article_metadata": {}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9409\"", "article_summary": "Yunker, who has spent most of his 25-year professional career in the health care industry, understood that consumers would face an uncertain health care environment.\nYunker spearheaded the MetroChicago Health Information Exchange, which allows Chicago-area health care institutions to securely share patient data so that health care professionals can more quickly treat patients.\n\u201cWe\u2019re making a difference and impacting lives.\u201d\u2018Patients are the ones who benefit\u2019On the local health care scene, Yunker has a reputation as a game-changing leader.\nAs senior vice president and chief financial officer of the Metropolitan Chicago Healthcare Council, he envisioned a solution that would reshape consumers\u2019 existing relationship with health care.\nAs a lecturer in the UIC School of Public Health since 2012, Yunker shares his in-depth knowledge of health care finance with students."}
