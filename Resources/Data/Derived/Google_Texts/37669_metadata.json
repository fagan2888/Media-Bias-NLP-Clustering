The clinic offers prescriptions to patients, with or without insurance. (Photo: Alejandra Armstrong/Cronkite News Service) Story Highlights A Dignity Health index shows that the Murphy School District community is one Phoenix's neediest\n\nThe Hispanic population is high risk for some chronic illnesses, such as diabetes and hypertension\n\nThe uninsured rate dropped to 13.6 percent in 2014 from 17.1 percent in 2013 in Arizona\n\nNot far from a sewage treatment plant, a landfill and the Maricopa County jail annex are the four schools and hundreds of families that make up the Murphy Elementary School District in South Phoenix, where more than 80 percent of its residents are Hispanic, most of them poor and many undocumented.\n\nThey live in neighborhoods where streets are lined with family-owned repair shops, scrap metal recycling sites, wrecking yards, dilapidated houses and ramshackle mobile homes. And like nearly one-third of Arizona\u2019s Hispanic population, many don\u2019t have health insurance.\n\nAt the center of the district shines a beacon of hope. The Murphy Education and Health Center, sandwiched between an unkempt empty lot and a mobile home park, appears out of place with its trimmed landscape of Palo Verde trees, industrial design and pristine glass windows and doors. When the sun hits the center just right, it literally shines.\n\nThe school district, in partnership with the nonprofit Mission of Mercy, offers a free clinic to community members every second and fourth Friday. The clinic, located at 3140 W. Buckeye Road, hopes to add more days, but there isn\u2019t enough money to do it now. Mission of Mercy Program Director Paula Carvalho has worked with nonprofits like the Mission of Mercy most of her adult life.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not a nurse. I\u2019m not a health professional,\u201d said Carvalho, who, among other things, helps raise money for the program. \u201cFor me, the work that I do has to come back to me in a way that I feel like I\u2019m contributing.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a way of being and knowing that you\u2019re in service and that you are contributing to a greater good, a bigger mission something greater than yourself,\u201d she said.\n\nEveryone in the school district area, bounded by 19th and 49th avenues, and from McDowell to Lower Buckeye roads, has access to this building and the Mission of Mercy clinic inside \u2014 something Medical Director Bradley Smith calls unique compared to other nonprofit clinics.\n\nMission of Mercy runs five other clinics in Arizona. The locations include Avondale, South Phoenix, Maryvale, North Central Phoenix and Mesa, all underserved communities.\n\nEach clinic provides primary care for children and adults with chronic illnesses, prescribes free medicine and doesn\u2019t have requirements for patients to meet for eligibility, meaning anyone \u2014 insured, uninsured, legal citizens or undocumented immigrants \u2014 can receive medical care at the clinic, few questions asked.\n\n\u201cMy personal belief is, you know, if they are lying to me or taking advantage, that\u2019s between them and God,\u201d Smith said.\n\nA doctor sees a patient at the Mission of Mercy clinic. The clinic's patients are 58 percent adult women, most of them Hispanic. (Photo: Alejandra Armstrong/Cronkite News Service)\n\nA community in need\n\nOn some days, women from the community come to the center for \u201ccafecitos,\u201d or coffee talk. On one Wednesday in October, the topic was breast cancer. They learn the clinic will be performing mammograms in December.\n\nSome probably have never had one.\n\nGriselda, 44, and her sister Maria, 40, arrive at the center in a their run-down SUV. There are 10 women in the classroom, all Hispanic, all mothers.\n\nGriselda started regularly coming to the free clinic at Murphy School District two years ago. Maria has only been to the doctor a few times in the last few years. The two sisters are undocumented and have no health insurance. They are also a part of the majority demographic of patients at the clinic: 58 percent are adult females.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there is anything particularly special about the Murphy district, or that area, but it falls in line with other areas of the Valley that are particularly in need of healthcare, dental care, etc.,\u201d Smith said.\n\nThe Mission of Mercy assesses community need for a clinic in part by using Dignity Health\u2019s Community Need Index scores. Scores are on a one-to-five scale with one being the lowest need and five being the highest need. Arizona has both a high percentage of uninsured residents and a growing Hispanic population. Nearly half of the Latino population in Arizona who live without health insurance say it\u2019s because they cannot afford it, according to the Arizona Health Survey in 2010.\n\nThe CNI score for zip code 85009 \u2013 and the Murphy School District area \u2013 is five. Dignity Health uses income barriers, as well as cultural/language, educational, insurance and housing barriers to formulate the scores.\n\nCarvalho said most live without health insurance because they can\u2019t afford it, are employed by a company that doesn\u2019t offer benefits or are afraid to ask about insurance because of perceived attitudes toward undocumented and poor populations.\n\nAccording to a report by the Morrison Institute for Public Policy released last year, parts of Phoenix, Tucson, as well as tribal and rural communities are most affected by the lack of health care options. \u201cIn other words, impoverished urban areas (with its large number of Latino residents) and rural areas (with its limited healthcare access) are most at risk,\u201d it said.\n\nA patient visits the Mission of Mercy clinic, which sees about 60 patients every second and fourth Friday of the month.

The uninsured rate dropped to 13.6 percent in 2014 from 17.1 percent in 2013 in Arizona, according to Census data. While those numbers seem promising, there still is a large group of vulnerable people in Arizona who, like Griselda and Maria, are left uninsured, some with no solution in the near future.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s say somebody migrates here from Mexico, they tend to go with the people they feel most comfortable with or who they made friends with, or who speak the same language,\u201d Smith added. \u201cSo the Murphy district is a good example, I think, of a lot of families who don\u2019t have documentation, their kids may not have been born here, therefore don\u2019t have access to Medicaid program AHCCCS [Arizona Health Care Cost Containment System].\u201d\n\nArizona State University health and wellness student Yanet Cora Kopnina volunteers with Mission of Mercy by leading health classes for the Murphy community.\n\n\u201cMurphy has four schools, lots of people and a very large Hispanic population,\u201d Kopnina said. \u201cThese people don\u2019t have access to health care so educating them is very important to prevent or to help manage chronic health issues- in part, so they don\u2019t go to the Emergency Room when they just need a primary care doctor.\u201d\n\nHispanics may need a visit to a primary care doctor more often than they realize because they are at high risk for certain chronic illnesses due to genetics and lifestyle choices.\n\nThe two most prevalent chronic illnesses in Hispanic patients are diabetes and hypertension, or high-blood pressure.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say those (diabetes and hypertension) are more common in Hispanics, but I think it\u2019s out of control with the Hispanic population for a couple of reasons,\u201d Smith said.\n\nA patient checks into the Mission of Mercy clinic, which is available to anyone in the Murphy Elementary School District community.

The nearest grocery store to the Murphy School District is a Food City \u2014 a local grocery chain known for its low prices and ethnic and specialty items \u2014 located a mile from the district\u2019s office.\n\nGriselda and Maria buy groceries from Food City because of its proximity. Typical meals for them include chicken with rice and vegetables, soup, quesadillas, beans and rice.\n\nA Safeway, a Fry\u2019s and a Basha\u2019s all are located on the outskirts of the community more than five miles away, a trek that some people in the community can\u2019t afford to take too often.Between them, there are 10 children and three grandchildren. The sisters waited two hours at St. Vincent de Paul for two food boxes so they could celebrate Thanksgiving with their family.\n\nOther convenience stores and fast food restaurants are closer than any of those supermarkets \u2014 Fred\u2019s Grocery, Rita\u2019s Mexican Food, Jack in the Box and Whataburger, to name a few.\n\nThrough Mission of Mercy, volunteer Ingrid Sawyer teaches a class on chronic diseases to the Murphy school district community. Her class covers several topics from depression to eating healthy over a course of six weeks.\n\n\u201cUnderserved communities don\u2019t have the research or knowledge to apply healthy practices for themselves let alone pass on those practices to their children,\u201d Sawyer said.\n\nOne in four people in Arizona report being obese. According to a Morrison Institute Public Policy report, that 25 percent attributed income as a driving factor of their condition.\n\nObesity is a leading cause of Type II diabetes, which Smith says is a prevalent chronic illness he sees at the Murphy clinic.\n\nGriselda started coming to the classes offered at the Murphy Education and Health Center because she wanted to learn.\n\nSince the center has been open, she\u2019s taken classes that have taught her about youth drug usage, safety in the house and high blood pressure, which she has suffered from for years. She and her sister continue to join the \u201ccafecitos\u201d conversation every Wednesday.\n\nThey made appointments at the clinic for mammograms in December, as did nearly 50 other women in the community.\n\nThe two sisters, both in their 40s, have never had one.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://azc.cc/1Y5Mypn", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "PHOENIX -- The Murphy School District area of South Phoenix is one of the city's highest-need communities.
