Ted Barrett and Tom Cohen\n\nCNN\n\nWASHINGTON (CNN) \u2014 Senate Democrats dropped the filibuster bomb Thursday, and now the question is what kind of fallout will result from the so-called nuclear option.\n\nBy a 52-48 vote, the Senate ended the ability of minority Republicans to continue using filibusters to block some of President Barack Obama\u2019s judicial and executive nominations, despite the vehement objections of Republicans.\n\nMajority Democrats then quickly acted on the change by ending a filibuster against one of Obama\u2019s nominees for a federal appeals court.\n\nObama later cited what he called \u201can unprecedented patter of obstruction in Congress\u201d during his presidency for the move led by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid.\n\n\u201cA deliberate and determined effort to obstruct everything, no matter what the merits, just to refight the results of an election is not normal,\u201d Obama said of the change. \u201cAnd for the sake of future generations, it cannot become normal.\u201d\n\nRepublicans warned the controversial move would worsen the already bitter partisan divide in Washington, complaining it took away a time-honored right for any member of the Senate minority party to filibuster.\n\n\u201cThis changes everything, this changes everything,\u201d veteran GOP Sen. John McCain of Arizona told reporters. He blamed newer Democratic senators who never served as the minority party for pushing the issue, adding: \u201cThey succeeded and they will pay a very, very heavy price for it.\u201d\n\nSenate GOP leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky called Thursday\u2019s maneuvering a diversion from the problem-plagued Obamacare issue that has been giving the White House and Democrats political headaches.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll regret this and you may regret it a lot sooner than you think,\u201d McConnell warned, adding that \u201cthe Democratic playbook of broken promises, double standards and raw power \u2014 the same playbook that got us Obamacare \u2014 has to end. It may take the American people to end it, but it has to end.\u201d\n\nCNN chief political analyst Gloria Borger said Democrats seem to believe that things couldn\u2019t get much worse, with judicial vacancies increasing and Republicans increasing their use of filibusters after an agreement earlier this year that cleared some presidential appointees.\n\n\u201cI think there is probably a little bit of \u2018calling your bluff\u2019 going on here; that Harry Reid basically threw up his hands and said, enough of this, it\u2019s time to do it,\u201d Borger said. Now, she added, the question was whether angry Republicans would further harden their positions in the already bitter political climate which she said \u201cwill get worse.\u201d\n\nThursday\u2019s change affected presidential executive nominations such as ambassadors and agency heads, along with judicial nominations except for Supreme Court appointees.\n\nIt did not affect the ability of Republicans to filibuster legislation.\n\nUnder the old rules, it took 60 votes to break a filibuster of presidential nominees. The change means a simple Senate majority of 51 now suffices in the chamber Democrats currently control with a 55-45 majority.\n\nThe nuclear option deployed by Reid allowed a procedural vote that required a simple majority to change the threshold for approving presidential and judicial nominees, instead of a super majority typically required.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time to get the Senate working again,\u201d the Nevada Democrat said on the Senate floor. \u201cNot for the good of the current Democratic majority or some future Republican majority, but for the good of the United States of America. It\u2019s time to change. It\u2019s time to change the Senate before this institution becomes obsolete.\u201d\n\nReid followed through on threats dating back years after Republicans blocked three judicial nominees to the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, known as the highest court in the land after the Supreme Court.\n\nBoth parties have been guilty of political hijinks involving filibusters.\n\nIn 2005, Republicans who then held the majority threatened the nuclear option to prevent Democratic filibusters of President George W. Bush\u2019s judicial nominees. The confrontation was averted thanks to an agreement by a bipartisan group of 14 senators.\n\nObama, then a senator, opposed the nuclear option at that time.\n\n\u201cI urge my Republican colleagues not to go through with changing these rules,\u201d he said on the Senate floor in 2005. \u201cIn the long run it is not a good result for either party. One day Democrats will be in the majority again and this rule change will be no fairer to a Republican minority than it is to a Democratic minority.\u201d\n\nAsked about Obama\u2019s past stance compared to his support Thursday for Reid\u2019s move, White House spokesman Josh Earnest cited increased obstruction of Obama nominees for the need to get the Senate working again.\n\n\u201cThe circumstances have unfortunately changed for the worse since 2005,\u201d Earnest said, noting that there were 50 judicial vacancies when Obama took office compared to 93 today and that many of the President\u2019s nominees have bipartisan support but can\u2019t get an up-or-down Senate vote.\n\nFurious Republicans accused Reid of reneging on a pledge against using the nuclear option.\n\n\u201cIt is another partisan political maneuver to permit the Democratic majority to do whatever it wants to do, and in this case it is to advance the President\u2019s regulatory agenda and the only cure for it that I know is an election,\u201d said veteran GOP Sen. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee.\n\nUntil now, Reid hadn\u2019t necessarily had support from enough of his own Democratic caucus to pass a rules change. Some Democratic senators were reluctant to change the rules because of reverence for the institution and, more importantly, because they know Democrats will not always be in the majority.\n\nVeterans such as Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California, who had been opposed to the nuclear option to change the Senate rules, recently decided to back Reid\u2019s move. Feinstein and others, like fellow Democratic Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont, said things were so broken in Washington that the nuclear option was the only way to fix it.\n\nThree Democrats voted with Republicans on Thursday in opposing the nuclear option \u2014 Sens. Carl Levin of Michigan, Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Mark Pryor of Arkansas.\n\nHowever, Republicans argued Democrats were just trying to manufacture a crisis in order to create a distraction from the Obamacare rollout debacle.\n\n\u201cSounds to me like Harry Reid is trying to change the subject and if I were taking all the incoming fire that he is taking over Obamacare I\u2019d try to change the subject too,\u201d House Speaker John Boehner said Thursday.\n\nCNN\u2019s Ashley Killough, Lisa Desjardins, Alan Silverleib and Paul Steinhauser contributed to this report.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2013 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.
