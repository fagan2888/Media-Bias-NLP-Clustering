Matt Stonie shocked the world of competitive eating Saturday when he beat eight-time champion Joey Chestnut for the Nathan’s Hot Dog Eating Contest title.

Stonie, 23, has a long list of accomplishments in his Major League Eating profile, including 14.5 pounds of birthday cake, 101 three-inch tacos, 10.5 pounds of frozen yogurt. Colorado’s own big eater Bryan “Big Sexy” Beard shared with me some thoughts on Stonie during our interview earlier this week:

The one guy that I’m enjoying watching chase Joey is Matt Stonie. They both live in San Jose, Calif. A couple years ago when he first got into it, I competed with him a couple times. The kid is amazing. It is ridiculous what this kid is doing. And I had the pleasure of sitting next to those two at the cow brain taco eating contest at the zombie pub crawl in Minneapolis a couple years ago. They just thoroughly embarrassed me. I think they were in the 50s and I think I hit, like, 12. It was cold cow brains. I understand you can get past the taste, but at this point, I’m looking down and I’m seeing its actual form of brain and it’s cold and it doesn’t taste like beef like I thought it was going to. It was one of those, just pack it up, pack it in because you’re eating with the best two in the world. They came to duel it out.
