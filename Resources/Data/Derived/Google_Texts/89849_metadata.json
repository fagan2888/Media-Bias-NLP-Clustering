Nate and the folks at eHealth are experts when it comes to Obamacare. Given all of the questions and uncertainties surrounding the Affordable Care Act, I was thrilled when Nate agreed to come on the show.\n\nThe Topics Covered on the Show\n\nWe covered just about every topic relevant to Obamacare in this nearly one hour interview, including the following:\n\nHow the Obamacare subsidies work and how you can determine whether you qualify\n\nWhether you can keep your existing health insurance policy even if it doesn\u2019t meet the new standards under Obamacare\n\nHow the platinum, gold, silver and bronze plans work\n\nWhat the out-of-pocket caps are and how they work for both individuals and families\n\nWhy those who do not receive a subsidy will have more health care insurance options and how to find these additional choices\n\nWhether you can switch plans in the middle of the year\n\nWhat are \u201cqualifying events\u201d that might allow you to change plans in the middle of the year\n\nWhether it\u2019s a good idea to wait until you\u2019re sick before buying insurance\n\nHow to determine if a health plan covers your existing doctors and area hospitals\n\nWhy the cost of health insurance is going up\n\nHow your age affects the premiums you\u2019ll pay\n\nHow Obamacare subsidies are calculated and tools to help you determine your eligibility\n\nIn addition, Nate and I discuss those states that may allow individuals to keep their existing insurance plans.
