A Tucson woman celebrated her 100th birthday Sunday, Jan. 3. Virginia Staub spent the day surrounded by friends and family.



The room was filled with pictures from the past 100 years of her life. Staub joined the army in 1942 and served for three years. But now, her life is very different. She has settled down in Tucson for the past 10 years and is enjoying the sunshine.



Two years ago she said was forced to start walking with a cane, but although her mobility is limited, her mind is still sharp. Staub’s son credited her longevity to having to walk everywhere, because Staub never got her driver’s license, and her positive attitude.



Staub said she was able to celebrate 100 years because of her diet.



“As my son would say, ‘I ate everything that came down the pipe,’ and this is true. And I ate fried foods - I'm from Kentucky, you know - fried chicken. And I never drank a whole lot, but I drank when I wanted to. I don't recommend it for everyone, but it worked for me and I'm thankful,” Staub said.
