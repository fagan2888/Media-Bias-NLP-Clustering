Vaughan et al. Cell Reports\n\nScientists have discovered one way that lung cancer spreads: through the breaking of protein ties that keeps cells together.\n\nThe images above depict microscopic photos of such protein ties: on the left, they\u2019re normal, and on the right they are severed. The ones on the right are lung cancer cells; because the tie is broken, they\u2019re way more likely to break down and spread throughout the body. The study was published in Cell Reports and conducted by researchers at the Cancer Research UK Manchester Institute.\n\nThe binding keeping cells together is controlled by a protein called TIAM1. When cell maintenance breaks down, TIAM1 gets impaired and allows cells to fall apart, then spread throughout the body.\n\n\u201cThis important research shows for the first time how lung cancer cells sever ties with their neighbors and start to spread around the body, by hijacking the cells\u2019 recycling process and sending it into overdrive,\u201d Dr. Angeliki Malliri, a lead author of the study, said in a press release. \u201cTargeting this flaw could help stop lung cancer from spreading.\u201d\n\nTypically, lung cancer spreads to lymph nodes in the chest, abdomen, neck, or armpit, as well as the liver, bones, or brain, according to Cancer Research UK. Lung cancer is particularly likely to spread through the lymph system because it enters lymph vessels around the bronchi in the lungs and begin forming clusters in lymph nodes, which are groups of immune cells.\n\nAccording to the National Cancer Institute, 2014 saw over 220,000 new cases of lung cancer in the U.S., and about half this number died from lung cancer. In the UK, there are some 43,500 new cases of lung cancer every year, and it's the most common cause of cancer deaths in the UK. \u201cLung cancer causes more than one in five of all cancer deaths in the UK and it\u2019s vital that we find effective new treatments to fight the disease and save more lives,\u201d Nell Barrie, Cancer Research UK\u2019s senior science information manager, said in the press release.\n\nThe authors of the study hope that their research will be one step forward for those looking to stop lung cancer in its tracks once it\u2019s been detected.\n\n\u201cEarly stage research like this is essential to find treatments which could one day block cancer spread \u2014 which would be a game changer,\u201d Barrie said in the press release. \u201cIt\u2019s also crucial that we find ways to diagnose the disease earlier, when treatment is more likely to be successful and the cancer is less likely to have spread.\u201d\n\nSource: Vaughan L, Tan C, Chapman A, Nonaka D, Mack N, Smith D. \u201cHUWE1 Ubiquitylates and Degrades the RAC Activator TIAM1 Promoting Cell-Cell Adhesion Disassembly, Migration, and Invasion.\u201d Cell Reports, 2014.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "lung cancer, how lung cancer spreads, tiam1", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Scientists analyzed microscopic images of the protein ties that keep cells stuck together, finding these bonds broken in lung cancer cells.", "title": "How Lung Cancer Spreads, And How Scientists Might Stop It", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/how-lung-cancer-spreads-scientists-pinpoint-severed-protein-cancerous-cells-315518", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/12/26/breaking-tiam1-ties.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Scientists analyzed microscopic images of the protein ties that keep cells stuck together, finding these bonds broken in lung cancer cells.", "title": "How Lung Cancer Spreads, And How Scientists Might Stop It", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/how-lung-cancer-spreads-scientists-pinpoint-severed-protein-cancerous-cells-315518", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/12/26/breaking-tiam1-ties.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/12/26/breaking-tiam1-ties.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Innovation", "published_time": "2014-12-26T15:12:06-05:00", "modified_time": "2014-12-26T15:20:16-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Scientists analyzed microscopic images of the protein ties that keep cells stuck together, finding these bonds broken in lung cancer cells."}, "article_summary": "According to the National Cancer Institute, 2014 saw over 220,000 new cases of lung cancer in the U.S., and about half this number died from lung cancer.\nWhen cell maintenance breaks down, TIAM1 ties are impaired, making cancerous cells more likely to break off and spread.\nCell ReportsScientists have discovered one way that lung cancer spreads: through the breaking of protein ties that keeps cells together.\n\u201cTargeting this flaw could help stop lung cancer from spreading.\u201dTypically, lung cancer spreads to lymph nodes in the chest, abdomen, neck, or armpit, as well as the liver, bones, or brain, according to Cancer Research UK.\nThe study was published in Cell Reports and conducted by researchers at the Cancer Research UK Manchester Institute."}
