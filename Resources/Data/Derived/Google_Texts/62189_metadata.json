Keeping important details to yourself may harm you in the long run. Doctors also know a lot of things we don\u2019t, so we patients have to ask the right questions.\n\nArmand Leone, Jr., MD, JD, MBA, board certified diagnostic radiologist and partner and co-founder of Britcher, Leone & Roth, shares these five things your doctor knows, but may not tell you unless you ask.\n\n1. Having elective surgery on a Friday or in the afternoon carries a higher mortality and complication rate than earlier in the week or day.\n\nObviously, when the situation is urgent, surgery can\u2019t wait, but for elective surgery, you might want to consider the timing. Make no mistake about it \u2014 ALL surgeries come with risks and complications. \u201cOn Monday, everybody there \u2014 surgeons, nurses, residents \u2014 are regular staff,\u201d Dr. Leone told Care2. \u201cAt about 4:00 p.m. on Friday, regular crews leave. When you have surgery at the end of the day, those 12 critical post-op hours happen during the night. Complications occur on the weekends, but it\u2019s more difficult to get immediate action on them because covering physicians don\u2019t know the patients as well and are less quick to intervene for another doctor\u2019s patient.\u201d\n\n2. Fatal medication errors spike by 10 percent every July as new medical residents start taking care of patients (J Gen Intern Med 2010).\n\nDepending on the situation, patients can\u2019t always be aware of what medications they\u2019re given. If you\u2019re conscious and clearheaded, Leone says you should have a rough idea of the medications you\u2019re supposed to get. \u201cAsk the nurses, confirm the details, and if it doesn\u2019t seem right or if the medication looks different from what you\u2019re usually given, ask the nurse to check with the doctor. Be vigilant and, in a nice way, ask questions. You don\u2019t want to become a pain in the ass, but it\u2019s your ass on the line.\u201d\n\n3. A misdiagnosis occurs in at least one out of every 20 patient encounters in doctors\u2019 offices (BMJ Qual Saf 2014).\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s start with this: Most medical errors in a primary care setting don\u2019t make a difference. Primary care docs have less time to talk and examine a patient, so there are certain mental short cuts.\u201d For example, a doctor sees 10 patients with the flu and you come in with flu symptoms. There\u2019s a bias toward diagnosing the flu. Leone says about half of this type of error have the potential for serious injury, but only a small percentage actually result in serious injury. \u201cThe good news is that most times, if a doctor sees a patient and gives the wrong diagnosis, with continuity of care, it gets reassessed.\u201d\n\nSo, what\u2019s a patient to do? \u201cIf you sense your doctor is rushed or not listening, or that the diagnosis may not be right, you need to break the autopilot and focus them. Ask your doctor: \u2018If the diagnosis isn\u2019t right, how and when will we know?\u2019 or \u2018How will we know if treatment is working?\u2019\u201d Your doctor should respond with something concrete so you have something to gauge and will know when to follow up.\n\n4. Your doctor\u2019s surgical and procedure complication rates and how they compare to the national rates for the same procedure.\n\nIt\u2019s not unreasonable to ask. \u201cFor any procedure, there are known complications and national averages,\u201d said Leone. \u201cA doctor should have a good idea of their personal complication rate. The surgeon who is dismissive or says it\u2019s \u2018not a problem\u2019 or it\u2019s a \u2018walk in the park\u2019 bothers me. I want the surgeon who goes in knowing there could be a complication and acknowledging they need to be on the lookout. If I ask a doctor about complication rates, I just want an honest answer. It doesn\u2019t have to be an exact number. At the end of the day, it\u2019s not so much the complication rate, but that they\u2019re aware that complications can occur. I just want to know they\u2019re watching carefully for complications and they\u2019re ready to deal with them.\u201d\n\n5. Doctors know the limits of modern medicine and most don\u2019t choose heroic cancer treatments or end-of-life care.\n\nSo what do doctors know that we don\u2019t? Sometimes, they know that heroic treatment won\u2019t change the outcome. \u201cJust because it can be done, it doesn\u2019t mean you should do it,\u201d said Leone. \u201cYou have to be realistic about the chances for a cure. There\u2019s a physical, emotional, and financial cost to medical treatment. Treatment is not without risks and drugs are not without adverse effects. When you know that, you can balance the equation differently. Is there a reason to put yourself through the ringer? Is it worth it? Quality of life is as important as length of life. That\u2019s why most doctors opt for less heroic end-of-life care, unless there\u2019s a specific reason to do otherwise.\u201d\n\nLeone believes that when patients are clinging to hope, it may be difficult for doctors to be completely honest about the prognosis. Patients have to ask the hard questions. What is the likelihood of a cure? How long will this treatment lengthen my life and what will my quality of life be?\n\nThe bottom line is that we patients should be partners in our own care. If we have a concern, it\u2019s up to us to ask questions. A good doctor won\u2019t mind. If your doctor discourages questions or dismisses your concerns, it\u2019s time to find a new doctor.\n\nRelated Reading\n\n5 Ways to Partner with Your Doctor\n\nDoes Your Doctor Touch You?\n\nWhy This Doctor Struggled as a Patient for a Day\n\nPhoto: AlexRaths, photographer | iStock | Thinkstock", "article_metadata": {"description": "If you want to make the most out of your time with your doctor, you've got to be honest.
