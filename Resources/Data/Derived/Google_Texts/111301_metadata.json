But microplastic is quickly emerging as the most problematic, threatening wildlife, human health and entire ecosystems.\n\nA recent European Commission report suggests that approximately 10 per cent of the global plastic manufactured each year (265 million tonnes) ends up in the oceans or other water systems. Plastic does not biodegrade fully: it photo-degrades into tiny particles that release toxic chemicals used in its production. Densities have been recorded at 100,000 particles per square meter. And fish, birds and marine mammals mistake it for food, clogging their digestive systems with garbage. Plastic makes its way up the food chain, right to the human dinner table.\n\nScientists have even coined a new term to describe it: the \u201cplastisphere\u201d is here. In some oceanic areas the plastic is so thick that organisms have begun evolving there, as if it were a new, toxic, ecosystem. Sadly, our precious Great Lakes may not be far behind.\n\nRecent evidence suggests we face a similar plague of plastic, much of it derived from microbeads used for largely cosmetic purposes: facial exfoliators, body scrubs, even toothpaste. Massive consumption of these products has sent plastic from bathroom drains to lake basins. Lakes Erie and Ontario seem hardest hit but all the lakes are acting as reservoirs for this toxic collection. Since getting the plastic out is an engineer\u2019s nightmare, stopping the deluge is of urgent necessity.\n\nWe need at least three thrusts of action here.", "article_metadata": {"description": "In some oceanic areas plastic waste is so thick that organisms have begun evolving there, as if it were a new, toxic, ecosystem.
