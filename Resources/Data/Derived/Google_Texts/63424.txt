The New Hampshire Republican Party is calling on New Hampshire Democrats to disavow vandalism to the GOP headquarters on Friday, when a pro-Obamacare message was spray-painted on the rear of the building.

The message reads “WWJD Healthcare for everyone,” in all capital letters. The New Hampshire Republican Party tweeted a picture on Monday morning.

“Our building was clearly vandalized by liberal political activists who disagree with our fiscally responsible values,” said NHGOP executive director Matt Slater in a statement. “Instead of trying to engage in a serious debate about the issues facing our country, these cowardly extremists decided to spread their liberal agenda by damaging on our property. This type of outrageous and illegal political activism should be condemned by the New Hampshire Democrat Party. They need to send a clear message to liberal activists that their shameful tactics have no place in politics.”

The vandalism was discovered Friday afternoon and reported to the police shortly after that, said NHGOP spokesman Ryan Williams. A police report will not come out until Tuesday, due to the Columbus Day holiday weekend.

“We’re calling on the New Hampshire Democratic Party to denounce these outrageous liberal tactics,” Williams told The Daily Caller, saying they need to make it clear such activity will “not be tolerated.”

The NHGOP is looking into the costs for removing the damage.
