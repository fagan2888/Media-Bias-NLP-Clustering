It's linked to obestity, diabetes, and poor cholesterol. With that being said, you\u2019re most likely still going to drink the sweet stuff, as half the U.S. population downs a can on a regular basis. In that case, I have some good news for you. A recent study shows some of soda's effects can be reversed by simply walking around a bit more.\n\nThe study was headed by Dr. Amy Bidwell, who at the time worked at Syracuse University. Bidwell had 22 healthy, college-aged students drink soda every day: two servings of lemon-lime soda with 75 grams of fructose, to be exact. The researchers took regular observations of their bodies\u2019 response to the fructose intake by recording their blood sugar, insulin levels, and other measures of general and metabolic health, The New York Times reported. The volunteers were also asked to complete questionnaires about their day-to-day diet and were equipped with an activity monitor to measure their daily amount of physical activity.\n\nHalf of the volunteers were asked to move around twice as much as they normally would and complete a total of 12,000 steps a day; this translates to about six miles. The control half were advised to carry on with as much physical activity as they normally would. It\u2019s not surprising that results strongly reflected the amount of physical movement volunteers completed each day. Participants who increased their number of daily steps \u201cwiped out all of the disagreeable changed wrought by the extra fructose,\u201d The Times reported. Even with the extra fructose intake, active young people were able to maintain normal blood sugar and cholesterol levels.\n\nBidwell asserts that her findings do not suggest a \u201ckey\u201d to drinking as much soda as your heart desires without any of the nasty side effects. Instead, the researcher hopes her results send out this simple yet important message: \u201cIf you are going to regularly consume fructose, be sure to get up and move around.\u201d\n\nThe science behind Bidwell\u2019s results is rather simple. Fructose, the form of sugar found in soft drinks, is metabolized in the liver where much of it becomes fatty acids. These fatty acids can either stay in the liver and contribute to nonalcoholic fatty liver disease or leave via the bloodstream and cause biological trauma elsewhere in the body. Physical movement is able to change how the body uses fructose and nearly erase any negative effects that too much fructose can cause to the body.\n\nOther than offering us some forgiveness for the six rum and cokes we may have downed last Friday, this study also offers additional good news: You don\u2019t have to be a runner to be healthy! One needn\u2019t complete a questionnaire to understand that the general consensus on running is that it\u2019s not fun. Even hardcore runners will complain every so often about this form of exercise.\n\nThis study shows that young people don\u2019t need to go to any extreme lengths to achieve a healthy amount of physical activity. Most volunteers in the study didn\u2019t even formally exercise. They simply \u201csat less, moved more,\u201d said Bidwell, explaining that doing things such as taking the stairs, parking further away from the store, or even just taking a casual stroll can be enough to help you get on the track to good health.\n\nSource: Bidwell A, Fairchild TJ, Redmond J, Wang L, Keslacy S, Kanaley JA.
