Photo: Chris Hyde\n\nScream queen Maria Sharapova shrieked mostly out of frustration before outlasting Estonian Kaia Kanepi 4-6, 6-3, 6-2 in a scrappy Brisbane International quarterfinal on Thursday.\n\nKanepi, the 2012 Brisbane International champion, threatened at one stage of their error-riddled display to do what few can - silence Sharapova.\n\nHowever, four-time grand slam champion Sharapova regained her composure to book a likely semi-final showdown with world No.1 Serena Williams.\n\nSharapova launched into her trademark screams on each point but little else resembled the world No.4 as she struggled to find her serving groove against the hard-hitting Kanepi.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe third seed was in her first tournament in five months after recovering from a shoulder complaint - and it showed on Thursday.\n\nIn just her second match since August after being gifted a Brisbane quarterfinal berth due to Aussie Ashleigh Barty's withdrawal, Sharapova faced her toughest assignment yet against world No.30 Kanepi.\n\nAnd the first Estonian to reach a grand slam quarterfinal and win a WTA tour title appeared up for the challenge, claiming the first set in 48 minutes.\n\nNo one held their serve in the first four games of the two-hour match as both mixed ugly unforced errors with thundering service returns.\n\nSharapova only held her serve twice amid a total of five breaks in the opening set.\n\nThe second began like the first with the pair trading breaks in the first two games before a Kanepi double fault gifted Sharapova a 4-2 lead and she didn't look back.\n\nSharapova broke again in the third game of the third to set up the win but she was left with plenty of homework to do ahead of her likely pre-Australian Open test against Williams.\n\nAAP", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Tennis", "application-name": "The Sydney Morning Herald", "og": {"site_name": "The Sydney Morning Herald", "description": "Scream queen Maria Sharapova shrieked mostly out of frustration before outlasting Estonian Kaia Kanepi 4-6, 6-3, 6-2 in a scrappy Brisbane International quarterfinal on Thursday.", "title": "Maria Sharapova into Brisbane International tennis quarter-finals", "url": "http://www.smh.com.au/sport/tennis/maria-sharapova-into-brisbane-international-tennis-quarterfinals-20140102-3079s.html", "image": "http://www.smh.com.au/content/dam/images/3/0/7/b/i/image.related.articleLeadwide.620x349.3079s.png/1388636050607.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@smh", "image": {"src": "http://www.smh.com.au/content/dam/images/3/0/7/b/i/image.related.articleLeadwide.620x349.3079s.png/1388636050607.jpg"}, "description": "Scream queen Maria Sharapova shrieked mostly out of frustration before outlasting Estonian Kaia Kanepi 4-6, 6-3, 6-2 in a scrappy Brisbane International quarterfinal on Thursday.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Maria Sharapova into Brisbane International tennis quarter-finals"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "Open The Sydney Morning Herald", "robots": "ACAP allow-present prohibited-modification=annotation", "fb": {"app_id": 193677504039845}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.smh.com.au", "msapplication-task": "name=Weather;action-uri=http://www.smh.com.au/weather;icon-uri=http://www.smh.com.au/favicon.ico;", "description": "Scream queen Maria Sharapova shrieked mostly out of frustration before outlasting Estonian Kaia Kanepi 4-6, 6-3, 6-2 in a scrappy Brisbane International ..."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda7f9\"", "article_summary": "Screamer: Maria Sharapova of Russia plays a forehand in her match against Kaia Kanepi of Estonia at Brisbane International.\nPhoto: Chris HydeScream queen Maria Sharapova shrieked mostly out of frustration before outlasting Estonian Kaia Kanepi 4-6, 6-3, 6-2 in a scrappy Brisbane International quarterfinal on Thursday.\nKanepi, the 2012 Brisbane International champion, threatened at one stage of their error-riddled display to do what few can - silence Sharapova.\nHowever, four-time grand slam champion Sharapova regained her composure to book a likely semi-final showdown with world No.1 Serena Williams.\nIn just her second match since August after being gifted a Brisbane quarterfinal berth due to Aussie Ashleigh Barty's withdrawal, Sharapova faced her toughest assignment yet against world No.30 Kanepi."}
