November fourth\u2019s electoral shellacking rendered the Chicago community organizer an ineffectual lame duck.\n\nWhatever unilateral actions he undertakes during his remaining two years in office can be undone by a smart and crafty Republican Congress \u2014 provided it uses its power of the purse.\n\nThe new focus of evil in the modern world has a profession and a name: MIT Professor Jonathan Gruber. Gruber represents the tyranny of the unscrupulous and agenda-driven \u201cexpert.\u201d The hypnotic spell cast by these experts should be known, now and forever, as the \u201cGruber Effect.\u201d\n\nAny honest discussion of the Gruber Effect must begin with Republican Governor Mitt Romney. Remember that Romney was easily dazzled (cowed) by Gruber\u2019s MIT credentials. As Massachusetts governor, Romney consulted with Gruber to concoct the Bay State\u2019s government-run health care monstrosity, along with its dictatorial \u201cindividual mandate.\u201d\n\nBack in 2011, the Washington Post\u2019s Jennifer Rubin interviewed Professor Gruber:\n\nGruber says in the one face-to-face meeting he had with Romney, it was clear Romney had made the \u2018final call.\u2019 Gruber tells me: \u2018He was the champion of the plan. He really was the consummate management consultant.\u2019 And, Gruber says, the [Obamacare] plan that passed and is now operating is not fundamentally different from the individual mandate plan that Romney \u2018championed.\u2019 Gruber says, \u2018The framework is basically the same.\u2019 Moreover, Romney understood that the bill would be a framework, with the details to be filled in later (e.g., the definition of \u2018affordable\u2019 health care). \u2018He said so at the signing ceremony,\u2019 Gruber recollects. So the notion that the plan was hijacked by the Democratic-controlled legislature is simply not so, he asserts.\n\nThat means one of two things: A) Romney agreed with Gruber\u2019s scheme to construct an authoritarian government program that was so convoluted it took an \u201cexpert\u201d to explain its complexities to \u201cstupid voters\u201d; B) Romney is as weak-minded and gullible (\u201cstupid\u201d) as the average Obama supporter. You know, the \u201c47 percent of the people\u201d Romney told a gathering in Boca Raton, Florida \u201cwho will vote for the president no matter what.\u201d\n\nIn either case, Romney\u2019s association with the condescending and dissembling Gruber disqualifies him from seeking the presidential nomination in 2016, unless, of course, it\u2019s the Democratic Party nomination.\n\nRubin\u2019s warning to Republican primary voters in 2011 is relevant today:\n\nIn short, Gruber is the most powerful voice (and the most dangerous one for the Romney campaign) for three fundamental points: 1) Romney championed the individual mandate, overriding concerns about personal freedom; 2) the plan today is pretty much the same as what Romney signed into law; and 3) without it in all likelihood we wouldn\u2019t have Obamacare today. That might sound like a reason for Democrats to vote for him, but in a Republican presidential primary all of that may be the death knell of the Romney candidacy.\n\nExperts in the media, joined by many expert Republican pundits, said Romney\u2019s moderate views made him an ideal candidate to face Obama in 2012. So, in a moment of sheer insanity, Republicans nominated Mitt Romney for the presidency.\n\nRepublican voters fell victim to the Gruber Effect.\n\nThe Gruber Effect has another designation: The \u201cAgency Theory,\u201d formulated by Yale University psychologist Stanley Milgram.\n\nBeginning in 1961, one year after Hitler\u2019s henchman Adolf Eichmann was tried and hanged in Israel for his part in the Holocaust, Dr. Milgram sought to understand if the millions of Germans that participated in the organized slaughter of 6 million Jews were accomplices to murder or, as many of them insisted, gullible dupes who were \u201cjust following orders.\u201d\n\nIn what became known as \u201cMilgram\u2019s Experiment,\u201d an associate pretending to be a participant in the study sat in one room with electrodes attached to his body. He was called the \u201cLearner.\u201d\n\nIn an adjacent room, another study participant, referred to as the \u201cTeacher\u201d (in this case a genuine volunteer), sat in front of a phony electric-shock generator. The machine\u2019s settings ranged from 15 volts (slight shock), 350 volts (danger) to 450 volts (certain death).\n\nAnother ringer for Dr. Milgram was dressed in an authoritative white lab coat. He was called the \u201cAdministrator\u201d and stood alongside the unsuspecting Teacher.\n\nThe experiment went something like this: The Teacher asked the Learner a series of written questions; the Learner intentionally answered most of the questions incorrectly; the Administrator (the authoritative-looking guy in the white lab coat) instructed the Teacher to give the Learner an electric shock for every wrong answer, increasing the voltage along the way.\n\nIf the feigned screams of the Learner caused hesitation in the Teacher, the Administrator was instructed to give the Teacher one of four verbal prods:\n\n\u201cPlease continue.\u201d \u201cThe experiment requires you to continue.\u201d \u201cIt is absolutely essential that you continue.\u201d \u201cYou have no other choice but to continue.\u201d\n\n100 percent of the Teachers participating in the study were willing to shock the Learner up to 300 volts. A whopping 65 percent were willing to subject the Learner to a lethal 450 volts of electricity for his incorrect answers.\n\nThey were following orders from the authoritative expert in the authoritative white coat.\n\nIn an article published in 1974, Dr. Milgram noted, \u201cStark authority was pitted against the subjects\u2019 strongest moral imperatives against hurting others, and with the subjects\u2019 ears ringing with screams of the victims, authority won more often than not. The extreme willingness of adults to go to almost any lengths on the command of an authority constitutes the chief finding of the study and the fact most urgently demanding explanation.\u201d\n\nMIT\u2019s Jonathan Gruber said the \u201clack of transparency\u201d he built into Obamacare is responsible for its passage; that the lies and complex formulations which shielded the law\u2019s dictatorial nature prevented \u201cstupid voters\u201d from derailing it.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d rather have [Obamacare] \u2026 than not,\u201d said Romney and Obama\u2019s egotistical expert to 310 million American souls.\n\n\u201cYou have no other choice but to continue,\u201d Gruber effectively said.\n\nNow, it falls to a Republican Congress to cripple and then repeal this liberty-crushing machine before its crackling electrical current rises to a deadly 450 volts.", "article_metadata": {"description": "You don't like Obamacare?
