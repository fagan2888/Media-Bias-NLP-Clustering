And, refunds are available, according to a post on its Facebook page.\n\n\u201cIf you purchased a ticket to Hunahpu's Day directly through Eventbrite.com, you will automatically be refunded your money,\u201d Cigar City said in its post. \u201c We will begin these refunds starting Monday.\n\n\u201cIf you paid for your ticket with cash or credit card in person, please email refund@cigarcitybrewing.com and we will directly communicate with you to determine the best way to get your money back.\u201d\n\nVideo posted on the website Beerpulse.com shows angry customers after the brewer ran out of Hunahpu Imperial Stout, even though patrons were promised three bottles each.\n\nAccording to the brewer's website, it brews the award-winning beer only once a year.\n\nThe brewer at 3924 W. Spruce St. acknowledged the event's shortcomings Saturday on its Facebook page: \u201cSo, today did not go as expected. We realize that there were a lot of issues with duplicate tickets, way too long waits in lines, and all of that. ...\n\n\u201cWe're completely sorry for all issues that happened today. It really sucked. We completely understand how much it sucked and hate how much it sucked. We don't want it to suck ever again. We will do what we can to make it right.\u201d\n\nAnd, then the company made the free beer offer available today.\n\n\u201cWe will not charge a dime for any beers served in the tasting room tomorrow. We are going to try and tap all of the remaining kegs leftover from today, too,\u201d the posting said.", "article_metadata": {"taboola-pub-time": "Sun, 09 Mar 2014 10:53:56 -0400", "Description": "Cigar City Brewing's fifth annual Hunahpu's Day Release Party didn't go as planned on Saturday, and there were lots of disgruntled beer fans.", "og": {"site_name": "TBO.com", "description": "Cigar City Brewing's fifth annual Hunahpu's Day Release Party didn't go as planned on Saturday, and there were lots of disgruntled beer fans.", "title": "Cigar City offers refunds, free beer after Hunahpu Day", "url": "http://www.tbo.com/events/cigar-city-offers-refunds-free-beer-after-hanahpu-day-20140309/", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20140309/ARTICLE/140309184/AR/0/AR-140309184.jpg", "height": 340}, "updated_time": "2014-03-09T11:24:00Z-04", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "tbo.com", "description": "Cigar City Brewing's fifth annual Hunahpu's Day Release Party didn't go as planned on Saturday, and there were lots of disgruntled beer fans.", "title": "Cigar City offers refunds, free beer after Hunahpu Day", "image": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20140309/ARTICLE/140309184/AR/0/AR-140309184.jpg", "site": "@TBOcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 522234267826834}, "msvalidate.01": "29E67031F86E7FB6DF9823924E21B8B4", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/tbocom", "published_time": "2014-03-09T10:53:56Z-04", "modified_time": "2014-03-09T11:24:00Z-04"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdcc69\"", "article_summary": "To make up for the trouble after the brewer was swamped with customers, the company is offering free beer in the tasting room today.\n\u201cWe will not charge a dime for any beers served in the tasting room tomorrow.\nCigar City Brewing's fifth annual Hunahpu's Day Release Party didn't go as planned on Saturday, and there were lots of disgruntled beer fans.\nWe will do what we can to make it right.\u201dAnd, then the company made the free beer offer available today.\n\u201cIf you purchased a ticket to Hunahpu's Day directly through Eventbrite.com, you will automatically be refunded your money,\u201d Cigar City said in its post."}
