This is because it clarified the grounds on which the eventual Reagan Revolution would be won. Reagan framed the choice as:\n\n\u201cWhether we believe in our capacity for self-government or whether we abandon the American revolution and confess that a little intellectual elite in a far-distant capital can plan our lives for us better than we can plan them ourselves.\u201d\n\nFifty years later, this choice remains at the center of our political debates. Our debt crisis has grown worse. The regulatory state has returned to high tide after ebbing temporarily under Reagan.\n\nWhere friends of limited government can take heart is that, today, there is a stronger voice than ever for Reagan\u2019s style of principled-but-inclusive, libertarian-tinged conservatism. I refer to not just the presidential hopefuls who, thanks to their tea party cred, seem to most excite the base. But also the think tanks, litigation centers, and grassroots organizations that focus on winning long-term victories for our freedoms.\n\nLook at the Goldwater Institute\u2019s work to upend the education establishment through Education Savings Accounts that create competition in education services by empowering parents instead of bureaucrats.\n\nOr how Illinois Policy Institute changed the terms of debate in that deep blue state, and ultimately defeated a movement to amend the Illinois Constitution and replace the state\u2019s flat income tax with a progressive rate structure. Now, over the next five years alone, nearly $30 billion will stay in the hands of Illinois\u2019 families and businesses instead of going to politicians in Springfield.\n\nOr the success of Foundation for Government Accountability \u2013 working with its allies in several states to stop the Medicaid expansion provisions in Obamacare. This is a major win for taxpayers, keeping millions of able-bodied Americans from becoming dependent on government for their health insurance.\n\nAt the Atlas Network, we talk of the challenges embraced by these groups as some of \u201cToday\u2019s Berlin Walls.\u201d The three organizations above are among the eight finalists for our 2014 Templeton Freedom Award, the biggest prize for honoring excellence by free-market think tanks.\n\nThe Berlin Wall seemed like a permanent barrier to freedom when Ronald Reagan said, \u201cMr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall.\u201d But less than three years later, it was gone.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Brad Lips", "description": "They're not physical obstructions anymore, but no less dangerous for freedom.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "Fifty years ago this month, Ronald Reagan burst onto the national political stage for the first time with a televised speech in support of Barry Goldwater\u2019s presidential campaign.  \u201cA Time for Cho", "title": "Who Has The Courage And Clarity To Topple Today\u2019s Berlin Walls?", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2014/10/08/who-has-the-courage-and-clarity-to-topple-todays-berlin-walls/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/1762245-e1409274896850.jpg", "height": 516}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "They're not physical obstructions anymore, but no less dangerous for freedom.", "title": "Who Has The Courage And Clarity To Topple Today\u2019s Berlin Walls?
