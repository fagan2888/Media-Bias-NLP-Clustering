Philipps\u2019 series was published in The Gazette and on gazette.com May 19-21, 2013.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re a little shocked and very happy,\u201d said Joanna Bean, managing editor of The Gazette, who, along with others, worked with Philipps on his award-winning series. \u201cWe are really happy to still be doing important journalism on the institutions in our town and on the people who live here.\u201d\n\nPhilipps journalism journey began when he was a paperboy as a youth, he said. In 2002, Philipps began an internship at The Gazette, which led to a staff position.\n\n\u201cWe write for our neighbors,\u201d he said.\n\nPhilipps, who covers the military for The Gazette, was also a Pulitzer finalist in 2010 for a series of \u201cpainstaking stories on the spike in violence within a battered combat brigade returning to Fort Carson after bloody deployments to Iraq, leading to increased mental health care for soldiers.\u201d\n\nPhilipps negotiates the balance of covering an institution, the U.S. Army, and the soldiers, neighbors and community members, who make up the massive government organization.\n\n\u201cInjured soldiers are the people we go to the grocery store with, we sit in the movie theaters with; they are very much a part of our community,\u201d Bean said. \u201cTheir story needs to be told. They are our friends and neighbors and family.\u201d\n\nPhilipps\u2019 Pulitzer-winning series has led to congressional hearings on the issues, according to the newspaper.\n\nHis series \u201cfocused on how the Army was discharging veterans, many of them with traumatic brain injuries or post-traumatic stress disorder, for minor misconduct. The brain injuries made them more likely to get into trouble but the discharges left them without military medical benefits to help them treat their injuries,\u201d The Gazette said on its Facebook page.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Colorado Springs Gazette reporter wins Pulitzer Prize", "title": "Colorado Springs Gazette reporter wins Pulitzer Prize", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/04/14/colorado-springs-gazette-reporter-wins-pulitzer-prize/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "height": 630}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-04-14T15:57:58+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-04-14T15:57:58+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8576\"", "article_summary": "David Philipps, a reporter with The Gazette newspaper in Colorado Springs, was awarded a Pulitzer Prize for national reporting Monday for a series on the mistreatment of wounded combat veterans.\nThe 2014 Pulitzer Prize winners were announced Monday at Columbia University.\nPhilipps\u2019 series was published in The Gazette and on gazette.com May 19-21, 2013.\nIn 2002, Philipps began an internship at The Gazette, which led to a staff position.\nThey are our friends and neighbors and family.\u201dPhilipps\u2019 Pulitzer-winning series has led to congressional hearings on the issues, according to the newspaper."}
