This includes permission for the government to help private companies build new vaccine production facilities.\n\nFood safety\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration gets $2.72 billion, $132 million more than last year. That includes a $104.5 million increase for food safety - almost the $110 million the agency says it needs to implement new rules to fight foodborne disease outbreaks that sicken 48 million Americans every year.\n\nAntibiotic resistance efforts\n\nThe bill includes $375 million to various agencies to battle antibiotic resistant germs.\n\nMammograms\n\nIt renews a provision that requires Medicare and Medicaid to pay for mammograms for women starting at age 40, despite federal recommendations that the breast cancer screenings can wait until women are 50.\n\nStray pets\n\nUSDA may not license \"class B dealers who sell dogs and cats for use in research, experiments, teaching, or testing.\" The provision is aimed at brokers believed to haunt animal shelters looking to sell unwanted pets for medical research.\n\nLosers:\n\nObamacare\n\nThe bill is full of digs at the Affordable Care Act, commonly referred to as Obamacare. It delays the so-called Cadillac tax on the most generous health insurance plans, costing the government an estimated $87 billion in revenue from 2018, when it was supposed to kick in, through 2025.\n\nIt also holds up a tax against medical devices, which device makers have been fighting against for years. And it slashes money for risk corridors, which compensate insurance companies that get stuck with sicker-than-expected patients. Insurance companies had insisted on this provision in return for the health care law's requirement that they take all comers, no matter how sick they are.\n\nDietary guidelines\n\nThe joint USDA/FDA food guidelines, which come out every five years, were due by the end of December. The bill holds that up after a big fight over an advisory panel's recommendations that included limiting salt, eating less meat and, most controversially, eating a plant-based diet that protects the environment. Now the agencies cannot release their guidelines until they can show they are \"based on significant scientific agreement; and \u2026 limited in scope to nutritional and dietary information\".\n\nSalt limits\n\nCongress is preventing the Agriculture Department from putting into effect any rule cutting sodium levels in federally provided meals \"until the latest scientific research establishes the reduction is beneficial for children.\"\n\nMenu labels\n\nThe FDA delayed its plan to require restaurants to add calorie counts to menus. The bill makes sure the calorie counts stay off menus for now.\n\nGene editing\n\nSome members of Congress were horrified by reports about an easier way to genetically modify plants and animals called gene editing. The bill specifically prohibits FDA from even looking at a plan to genetically modify a human embryo. Experts say this effectively bars even a private company from trying to market such a treatment since it would need FDA approval if it were used on an embryo intended to create a pregnancy. It wouldn't stop privately funded lab research, however.\n\nGun research\n\n\"None of the funds made available in this title may be used, in whole or in part, to advocate or promote gun control,\" the bill reads. Health agencies such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have taken this over the years as a warning not to undertake any research on gun deaths.\n\nGMO Salmon\n\nFDA won't be able to allow the sale of genetically modified salmon until it has a plan for labeling the fish. And out of FDA's budget \"not less than $150,000 shall be used to develop labeling guidelines and implement a program to disclose to consumers whether salmon offered for sale to consumers is a genetically engineered variety.\" When FDA approved GM salmon last month it said companies didn't have to label it, provoking the fury of anti-GMO groups.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Congress singles out genetically modified salmon, menu labels and mammograms in a spending bill that comes up for a vote Friday.", "og": {"site_name": "NBC News", "description": "Congress singles out genetically modified salmon, menu labels and mammograms in a spending bill that comes up for a vote Friday.", "title": "Budget Bill Limits New Food Advice, Edited Humans, GM Salmon", "url": "http://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/budget-bill-limits-new-food-advice-edited-humans-gm-salmon-n482126", "image": "http://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2015_11/926296/2015-02-26t144801z_2059444516_gm1eb2q1r4t02_rtrmadp_3_usa-congress_cf655b7751a3ac35dde721c5c47d18a9.nbcnews-fp-1200-800.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "NBCNews.com", "description": "Congress singles out genetically modified salmon, menu labels and mammograms in a spending bill that comes up for a vote Friday.", "creator": "NBCNews", "image": {"src": "http://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2015_11/926296/2015-02-26t144801z_2059444516_gm1eb2q1r4t02_rtrmadp_3_usa-congress_cf655b7751a3ac35dde721c5c47d18a9.nbcnews-fp-1200-800.jpg"}, "title": "Budget Bill Limits New Food Advice, Edited Humans, GM Salmon - NBC News", "site": "NBCNews", "card": "summary"}, "blitz": "mu-e1e842c9-946002e6-ea8f0454-41b29546", "DC.date.issued": "2015-12-18", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=319740707, app-argument=http://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/budget-bill-limits-new-food-advice-edited-humans-gm-salmon-n482126", "fb": {"app_id": 10150138890205613}, "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/pages/Maggie-Fox/262695730411456"}, "google-site-verification": "K8bowvEbzWfPQ76x6f9SCxMVwicVXrhiClRg80ak8ZA", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Health,Health news,Business News,Congress,Consumer,Economy,Science News"}, "article_summary": "The provision is aimed at brokers believed to haunt animal shelters looking to sell unwanted pets for medical research.\nPandemic preparednessPublic health agencies get $72 million to prepare for a flu pandemic.\nFood safetyThe Food and Drug Administration gets $2.72 billion, $132 million more than last year.\nWhen FDA approved GM salmon last month it said companies didn't have to label it, provoking the fury of anti-GMO groups.\nPlanned ParenthoodThe bill doesn't defund the health provider, despite promises from many lawmakers to do just that."}
