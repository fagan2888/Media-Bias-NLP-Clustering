REDDING, Calif. -

Local registered dietitian and nutrition professor at Shasta College, Joanne Tippin, said the study released by the World Health Organization that says processed and red meats can cause cancer is valid.

She said the study revealed what health officials have said all along, red meat and processed meat can be healthy in moderation.

The study said processed meat, for example cold cuts or hotdogs, increase the risk for colon and stomach cancer.

Tippin said the study isn't surprising, but it does suggest a balanced diet is important.

"The good information from that, is that you don't have to cut it out altogether, but perhaps look at how frequently you allow yourself to do that," Tippin explained.

"So do two servings, because people are always, well what does that mean? So a serving size is about 3-4 ounces so if you can limit your red meat to, about you know, six ounces a week. That would be the recommendation," she added.

Tippin said other factors cause carcinogens on meat, like the way the meat is cooked. She said it's best to cook on low temperatures so none of the meat gets charred.

Tippin also said exposure to processed meat at a young age can increase risk for breast cancer.
