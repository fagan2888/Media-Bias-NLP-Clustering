One of those in Cleveland County is making it impossible for some people to get anywhere.\n\nCarolyn Drive is a half-mile long stretch of gravel road, a quarter-mile east of 149th Street and Harrah Newalla Road. Residents along Carolyn Road told News 9 the road washed away last week, and with every rain it's getting worse.\n\n5/10/2015 Related Story: Sinkhole Traps Residents In McLoud\n\nThey said nine families live along Carolyn Drive, which they said has been in existence for two decades. Those residents, they said, include three people who are disabled, and three newborn babies.\n\nOkey McCarty said his wife is disabled, and they live at the end of the road. \u201cWe called the county, and the county said it's not a county road, so they won't help us at all.
