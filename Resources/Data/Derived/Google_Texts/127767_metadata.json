The fact that hundreds of thousands of people pushed Obamacare over the 7 million goal is a far bigger story than the website crashing for a while.\n\nThe Washington Post, meanwhile, fronted this headline, which works fine:\n\nHealthCare.gov hiccups amid deadline-day frenzy\n\n\n\nAmericans racing to sign up before midnight encounter glitches\n\nSee James Fallows for more on the slant that shows up too often in the Murdoch-era Journal.\n\n\u2014 Check out this great site from NYU on undercover reporting and its role in the great stories of the last 150 years.\n\nThis collaboration with NYU Libraries collects many decades of high-impact, sometimes controversial, mostly U.S.-generated journalism that used undercover techniques. It grows out of the research for Undercover Reporting: The Truth About Deception (Northwestern University Press, 2012), which argues that much of the valuable journalism since before the U.S. Civil War has emerged from investigations that employed subterfuge to expose wrong. It asserts that undercover work, though sometimes criticized as deceptive or unethical, embodies a central tenet of good reporting\u2014to extract significant information or expose hard-to-penetrate institutions or social situations that deserve the public\u2019s attention. The site, designed as a resource for scholars, student researchers and journalists, collects some of the best investigative work going back almost two centuries.\n\nLook at the \u201cOther People\u2019s Work\u201d section, which highlights dozens of undercover reports ranging from the mattress factories of Minnesota in 1888 to a Toronto Star report from last year on child labor in Bangladesh. Fascinating.\n\n\u2014 This Fortune piece on \u201cWhy America\u2019s fear of \u2018too big to fail\u2019 is irrational\u201d is a bit off (emphasis mine):\n\nThe U.S. Federal Reserve recently concluded that six of America\u2019s biggest banks enjoy about $8.5 billion a year in savings, mostly in the form of paying lower borrowing costs than smaller institutions. That might sound unfair, but that\u2019s a pretty small price U.S. taxpayers effectively pay to avoid another financial crisis. In addition, the Troubled Asset Relief Program, though unpopular, actually netted a profit for taxpayers as the government\u2019s investments have been gradually wound down; and then there is the case of Ally, the former General Motors finance subsidiary, whose planned IPO will result in a gain for the public.\n\n\n\nStill, the fear of \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d persists. The reason for this is a lack of understanding of why our biggest banks can\u2019t really be allowed to fail. \u201cToo big to fail\u201d doesn\u2019t exist because we have sympathy for Citigroup or JPMorgan Chase or because Wall Street is too powerful. It exists to preserve the integrity of the global financial system, which is a complex and interconnected web of financial relationships that cannot realistically be insulated from the downfall of even a single large bank.\n\nFortune is saying that these TBTF subsidies are what Americans pay to avoid financial crises. That\u2019s just staggeringly wrong. Those subsidies (which most studies conclude are far larger than $8.5 billion a year) are what banks get because markets perceive them as too big to fail and thus lend to them at lower rates.\n\nBut big banks got these indirect subsidies for years years before the 2008 crisis too. An implicit government backstop doesn\u2019t prevent a financial crisis from occurring. If anything, it makes it more likely.\n\n\n\n\n\nRyan Chittum is a former Wall Street Journal reporter, and deputy editor of The Audit, CJR's business section.
