The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that around 1 in 20 or 5% of hospitalized patients will contract an HAI. Worldwide, the rate of nosocomial infections is between 3.5% and 12% of admissions in developed regions. This has created a market opportunity for companies that can test for, treat and help prevent these infections. This opportunity is detailed in Kalorama Information's report, The Market for Hospital-Acquired Infection Control (Sterilization, Cleaning, Testing, Treatment)\n\n\n\nThis report focuses on preventing, testing and treating infections in the healthcare environment. The major consideration is given to bacterial nosocomial infections because a) they are the most frequent type of infections spread in the health care delivery setting, and b) the practical aspects of diagnosis and therapy are more meaningful based on a combination of medical and financial considerations.\n\nThe report will provide a market analysis in the areas of Prevention, Testing and Treatment.\n\n\n\nMarket analysis in this report considers primarily the epidemiological considerations and the size patient groups both in the United States and globally, where available. We have accumulated the most recent data available, understanding that virtually no organization does extensive studies on these applications on a regular basis.\n\n\n\nMany studies are highly localized and may only apply to a community, state or country (more often countries that are not a part of the major markets for nosocomial diagnostic and therapeutic products). In many instances, we have had to draw from broader epidemiologic data, that is, on data that reach outside of the hospital and primary care environment in order to construct a picture of the infection prevention, testing and treatment needs.\n\n\n\nIn looking at infections in the health environment, we consider the diagnostic and therapeutic technologies that are currently available and attempt to project trends for preventing, detecting and treating these infections. To some extent, we are limited by the activity of the industries associated with the activities mentioned above for these infections. For the most part, these activities are limited and the advanced technologies seen in other areas of medical application are not necessarily present in terms of microbiology.\n\n\n\nThe majority of competitive participation for Hospital-Acquired Infection control and is in the United States and Europe. However, competition is steadily escalating in the United States and Europe, which is encouraging more participation in other areas such as Asia and Latin America.\n\nCompanies in this report
