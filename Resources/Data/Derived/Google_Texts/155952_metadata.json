That, and also, the Affordable Care Act,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cYou know, we\u2019ve got to change that because we have built in some unfortunate incentives that discourage full-time employment. A lot of employers believe if you don\u2019t work 40-hours a week you don\u2019t get benefits and that includes you don\u2019t get health care benefits; that might include you\u2019re not eligible for the family medical leave; you\u2019re not eligible for paid sick days.\u201d\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office projects that the employer mandates will costs businesses $167 billion from 2016 to 2025.\n\n\u201cThere is a disincentive in our system that we need to deal with and I really worry about it because there is a trend to try and move more and more people into part-time work; and how many of you are part-time workers?\u201d Clinton added. \u201cAnd sometimes you want to work part-time, it fits into your family, it fits into your life obligations but sometimes you want to work full-time but you can\u2019t get a full-time job. So, I want to look at all the employment rules.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30; polling-uri=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/1.xml; polling-uri2=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/2.xml; polling-uri3=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/3.xml; polling-uri4=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/4.xml", "application-name": "TheBlaze.com", "twitter": {"description": "Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton told a gathering in Iowa City that the Affordable Care Act, better known as Obamacare, is pushing people into part-time jobs.  \u201cWe have built in some unfortunate incentives that discourage full-time employment,\u201d said the former secretary of state who has backed the Obamacare...", "creator": "@FredLucasWH", "url": "http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2015/12/17/hillary-makes-major-admission-about-of-obamacares-impact-on-jobs/", "image": "http://www.theblaze.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Screen-Shot-2015-12-17-at-10.45.23-AM.png", "title": "Hillary Makes Major Admission About Obamacare\u2019s Impact on Jobs", "site": "@theblaze", "card": "summary", "account_id": 1512944287}, "keywords": "hillary, has, stinging, criticism, obamacares, impact, jobs", "sailthru.tags": "campaign-2016, hillary-clinton, obamacare, politics, video, watch, author-fred-lucas, site-theblazecom", "facebook-count": 151, "gplus-count": 1, "msapplication-TileColor": "#282b2d", "sailthru.guid": "theblazecom/1052412", "categories": "campaign-2016,hillary-clinton,obamacare,video,watch,politics", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://www.theblaze.com/wp-content/plugins/theblaze_livetile/img/medium150x150.png", "comment-count": 54, "description": "Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton told a gathering in Iowa City that the Affordable Care Act, better known as Obamacare, is pushing people into part-time jobs.  \u201cWe have built in some unfortunate incentives that discourage full-time employment,\u201d said the former secretary of state who has backed the Obamacare...", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://www.theblaze.com/wp-content/plugins/theblaze_livetile/img/wide310x150.png", "linkedin-count": 0, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://www.theblaze.com/wp-content/plugins/theblaze_livetile/img/small70x70.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://www.theblaze.com/wp-content/plugins/theblaze_livetile/img/large310x310.png", "fb": {"admins": 517831498}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.theblaze.com/", "viewport": "width=device-width", "og": {"site_name": "The Blaze", "description": "Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton told a gathering in Iowa City that the Affordable Care Act, better known as Obamacare, is pushing people into part-time jobs.  \u201cWe have built in some unfortunate incentives that discourage full-time employment,\u201d said the former secretary of state who has backed the Obamacare...", "title": "Hillary Makes Major Admission About Obamacare\u2019s Impact on Jobs", "url": "http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2015/12/17/hillary-makes-major-admission-about-of-obamacares-impact-on-jobs/", "image": {"width": 584, "identifier": "http://www.theblaze.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Screen-Shot-2015-12-17-at-10.45.23-AM.png", "type": "image/png", "height": 387}, "type": "article"}, "dc.date": "2015-12-17T11:03:39+00:00", "twitter-count": 0}, "article_summary": "\u201cYou know, we\u2019ve got to change that because we have built in some unfortunate incentives that discourage full-time employment.\n\u201cWe have built in some unfortunate incentives that discourage full-time employment,\u201d said the former secretary of state who has backed the Obamacare law.\nDemocratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton told a gathering in Iowa City that the Affordable Care Act, better known as Obamacare, is pushing people into part-time jobs.\n\u201cAnd sometimes you want to work part-time, it fits into your family, it fits into your life obligations but sometimes you want to work full-time but you can\u2019t get a full-time job.\nIn addition to blaming Obamacare, Clinton also said the Family and Medical Leave Act signed into law by her husband, President Bill Clinton, shares some blame for so many part-time jobs as well."}
