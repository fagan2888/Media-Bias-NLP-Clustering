Bruce replied that he only wished to speak with an advisor, and wasn\u2019t harassing anyone. She responded: \u201cSitting here until somebody is available is harassing. Would you like for me to call campus security?\u201d\n\nWe only see 30 seconds of the encounter, and it\u2019s of course possible that Bruce did something off-camera that made Dawson\u2019s accusation of harassment more credible. But the evidence of Bruce\u2019s prior email correspondence with her certainly suggest that she\u2019s an irritable and unhelpful administrator. Bruce later clarified on Twitter that he had hoped to avoid her by going to the office to speak with a different advisor since \u201che found her unhelpful in the past,\u201d according to The Huffington Post.\n\nBruce isn\u2019t the first student to complain about this particular administrator:\n\nOne student, Amber Wann, said she had difficulty getting into a couple classes she needed and was worried she would fall behind. When she asked if there was a way to avoid the waitlist, Dawson replied in an email, \"I will not continue to answer the same question.\" Wann tweeted a screenshot of the exchange\u2026 Another student, Austin Smith, tweeted about an encounter he had with Dawson during the advisory office's posted open hours. Smith said that he arrived about halfway through the time-slot, but Dawson told him they had finished early and were moving on to a workshop.\n\nThe surge in tuition prices over the last two decades is in no small part due to the fact that American universities have created vast armies of administrators to fill out purported \u201cstudent services\u201d and advising positions. Given how much students are paying for these extravagances, one would expect people like Dawson to be a little more customer-focused in the course of their jobs.\n\nAlso, is the definition of harassment now just \u201canything that bothers anyone\u201d at university campuses?", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "'Would you like for me to call campus security?'", "title": "Nightmare Administrator Thinks Student Waiting Patiently for Assistance Is Harassing Her", "url": "http://reason.com/blog/2015/05/15/nightmare-administrator-thinks-student-w", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14317130055834.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "'Would you like for me to call campus security?'", "title": "Nightmare Administrator Thinks Student Waiting Patiently for Assistance Is Harassing Her", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14317130055834.jpg", "creator": "@robbysoave", "site": "@reason", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 17548474116}, "article": {"tag": "Culture", "published_time": "2015-05-15T18:15:00+00:00", "author": "http://reason.com/people/robby-soave"}, "msvalidate.01": "212A68A07785B3080038A845C4EE8905", "google-site-verification": "-AmMiilAN-pnjWt369CUWae-VQ-b9wmH4fSGyhbkQxw", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9b09\"", "article_summary": "The student, Kevin Bruce, was waiting in the advising offices of the Georgia university when Dawson accused him of harassing her and ordered him to leave.\nA Kennesaw State University student recorded a short video of his unpleasant interactions with a woman named Abby Dawson, who may be the most unhelpful advisor in history.\nWann tweeted a screenshot of the exchange\u2026 Another student, Austin Smith, tweeted about an encounter he had with Dawson during the advisory office's posted open hours.\nBruce replied that he only wished to speak with an advisor, and wasn\u2019t harassing anyone.\nBut the evidence of Bruce\u2019s prior email correspondence with her certainly suggest that she\u2019s an irritable and unhelpful administrator."}
