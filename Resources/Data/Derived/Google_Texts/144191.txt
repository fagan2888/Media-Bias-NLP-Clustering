× Proposal would provide free basic phone, Internet service in West Valley City

WEST VALLEY CITY, Utah – Residents in West Valley City may soon have access to phone and internet services for free thanks to a deal with a California-based service provider.

Ooma is looking to build a fiber optic network that would reach more than 40,000 homeowners in West Valley City, and basic phone and internet services would be free—though residents would pay taxes and fees.

According to a press release from West Valley City, the city council is reviewing a proposal from the Macquarie Capital Group regarding the fiber network. If the deal is accepted, West Valley City residents would pay a utility fee to access the network and private companies would then provide free basic Internet service.

The press release states similar services cost at least $65 per month and that this service could save users at least $540 each year.

West Valley City Manager Wayne Pyle stated in the press release they are considering the proposal.

“Our city council is always searching for ways to provide maximum value and benefit to our residents in return for the dollars they contribute to the community.Wiring our entire community with world-class fiber to the home ensures that our residents will have unmatched access to all of the services that the network can provide.”

Eric Stang, Ooma CEO, said they look forward to progressing with the plan.

“We are excited to be working with West Valley City to get our service to its residents,” Stang said. “West Valley City’s unparalleled initiative will not only save its citizens money, it will allow them to stay connected in ways they cannot yet imagine.”
