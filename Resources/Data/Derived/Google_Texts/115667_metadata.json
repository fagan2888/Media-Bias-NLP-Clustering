That\u2019s a doubling of the salary threshold for overtime eligibility from the previous $23,660 a year. The salary level will be updated every three years.\n\nDOL estimated that this will result in about 4.2 million more employees qualifying for overtime pay under the new rule.\n\nEmployers can satisfy up to 10 percent of the salary level with bonuses, incentive payments or commissions, provided they're offered on at least a quarterly basis.\n\n\u201cThe overtime rule in some way or another is going to impact the workforce across the United States and every company needs to review its eligibility rules for all the benefits it provides,\u201d Will Hansen, the ERISA Industry Committee's senior vice president of retirement policy, told Bloomberg BNA.\n\nImplications for 401(k) Plans\n\nHansen addressed the rule\u2019s implications for sponsors of Section 401(k) plans. He noted, for example, that a 401(k) plan may define \u201ccompensation\u201d to include or exclude overtime pay. Sponsors of 401(k) plans may also have different eligibility and contribution rates depending on whether an employee is paid by the hour or is on salary.\n\nHansen said plan sponsors should \u201cdive into the details\u201d to see how the overtime rule might affect nondiscrimination testing, which requires that the plan not discriminate in favor of highly compensated employees as to contributions or benefits.\n\nFor example, if a company increases its hourly workforce and decreases its salaried workforce, but only salaried workers are eligible for the plan, low-paid employees are being dropped from the plan, which could make passing nondiscrimination testing more difficult, he said.\n\nBeyond 401(k) plans, the overtime rule has the potential to impact many other benefits.\n\n\u201cIf the company differentiates benefits based on the number of hours, part-time versus full-time, hourly or salaried, this could impact in a positive or negative way all benefits\u201d ranging from health care eligibility to tuition reimbursement and transportation subsidies, Hansen said.\n\nHours and Compensation Audit\n\nThe overtime rule is an opportunity for employers to do an inventory of their current benefits and associated costs.\n\n\u201cWe are advising our clients to first understand what the right classification is for their employees and do a fresh wage and hour and compensation audit,\u201d just as they did when the Affordable Care Act was passed, Mark Sinatra, CEO of Staff One HR in Dallas, told Bloomberg BNA.\n\nThe audit should comprise the following steps, Sinatra said:\n\nA deep dive review into the hours worked and the proper classification of employees; Assessing the steps employers need to take in response to those findings, including the cost of implementation; and Making sure that any changes are documented in the company handbook, job descriptions, salary classifications, and are communicated to the employees.\n\nCompanies also need to determine whether changes in benefits will allow them to remain competitive in the marketplace, he said.\n\nComplying with the overtime rule may also put a strain on employers\u2019 benefits budgets, Sinatra said. For 401(k) plans, a key question will be, \u201cwhat is the benefits vesting period and the company match?\u201d\n\n\u201cCertainly the trend in the last few years is employers providing more employer-sponsored benefits, such as gym programs and wellness. There\u2019s not an unlimited budget. Will the pie expand, and if so, by how much?\u201d\n\nSome employers may also convert ancillary benefits they typically pay for, such as dental, vision, life and disability insurance, into benefits that employees voluntarily pay for if salaries increase due to the overtime rule, he said.\n\nSee related story, Overtime Rule Sparks Debate over Next Steps.\n\nStay on top of the latest industry trends and news coverage with a free trial to the Benefits Practice Resource Center.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.bna.com/employers-ponder-benefit-b57982072987/", "image": "http://www.bna.com/uploadedImages/BNA_V2/Company/BnaSocialShare.jpg", "description": "Employer-sponsored benefits will be under the microscope as companies consider the consequences of having to pay more employees time-and-a-half for time worked...", "title": "Employers Ponder Benefit Changes Under New DOL Overtime Rule"}, "csrf-token": "yZhMktNS9QjbnJ-t9G0w-714SoguHCDiX7-5eE1hJCP1DdlMywNRFV2hDEdqTetp1PbiQy3JX3V4qRm4mmtjsX3EAP48nT2ksppQUbvdmlA1:hLpVTzvfGkwqlPuzbQmjYs-MV1l8P9gIK6nooQ4ya85B0sr-fUCR5C0EKRvTp59AFg9EivDCaJbq3T291lG8FdNtN4b4ZiQLiVDcQwc_lyc1", "description": "Employer-sponsored benefits will be under the microscope as companies consider the consequences of having to pay more employees time-and-a-half for time worked", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "fragment": "!"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1bc5\"", "article_summary": "Complying with the overtime rule may also put a strain on employers\u2019 benefits budgets, Sinatra said.\nDOL estimated that this will result in about 4.2 million more employees qualifying for overtime pay under the new rule.\nHours and Compensation AuditThe overtime rule is an opportunity for employers to do an inventory of their current benefits and associated costs.\nSee related story, Overtime Rule Sparks Debate over Next Steps.\nHe noted, for example, that a 401(k) plan may define \u201ccompensation\u201d to include or exclude overtime pay."}
