The other reason may be the complexity of the insurance system and widespread ignorance about how it works.\n\nAt least that\u2019s the impression that The Brooklyn Ink gathered from a visit to an information session this week about the Affordable Care Act held in South Brooklyn.\n\nNationwide, a little more than 106,000 successfully signed up for healthcare during the law\u2019s first month, according to data released by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services\u2014a figure much smaller than the 500,000 expected. The blame was placed mainly on technical problems with HealthCare.gov, the federal exchange where residents in many states must go to purchase insurance. Two thirds of the \u201chigh-priority bugs\u201d in the system have been fixed, according to congressional testimony this week.\n\nNew York, which runs its own healthcare exchange, is doing better. As of November 12th, 48,162 people had enrolled in a low-cost health insurance plan and 197,011 had completed the full application process and been determined eligible for the program, according to officials from the New York State Department of Health. Still, this is a small percentage of the 1,675,731 people who are uninsured in New York state. Out of that number, 271,457 live in Brooklyn, according to a report released by the Urban Institute Health Policy Center in January.\n\nA major roadblock for Obamacare seems to be a lack of education about how it works. At least that\u2019s how Deborah Carter sees it. Carter, 57, is president of the Gravesend Houses Resident Association in Coney Island, and traveled to an information workshop over the weekend at Christ Temple United Baptist Church, 2678 86th Street, in South Brooklyn.\n\n\u201cI came here for my people,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re afraid that they\u2019ll have to pay more and they really need a better understanding. People are asking questions about this,\u201d said Carter, who represents 1,680 residents in her housing complex.\n\nThe event, which was sponsored by the National Action Network of South Brooklyn Chapter, a civil rights organization founded in 1991 by Reverend Al Sharpton, is one of a series of three that will be taking place in South Brooklyn in the next few months.\n\nQueenie Huling, 65, the President of NAN South Brooklyn, organized the South Brooklyn event with the help of Reverend Frank Mason, who leads Christ Temple United. Huling said it was important to make all of the resources physically available for the community, referring to the navigators from the Brooklyn Chamber of Commerce and the state-certified counselors who were on hand to provide the public with answers and to help those eligible for coverage with their sign-up.\n\n\u201cIt gave the public an opportunity to ask the questions. Things like: \u2018How does it work? What are the benefits for the public?\u2019 A lot of people have those questions,\u201d said Huling.\n\nRican Vargas, of Coney Island, was one of the 53 people \u2013 all who ranged from middle-aged to senior citizens \u2013 who showed up at the workshop on Saturday afternoon. Mr. Vargas, who runs his own business, doesn\u2019t have health insurance. \u201cIt\u2019s crazy times, man,\u201d he said later, over the phone. \u201cThey need to get it together with this whole Affordable Healthcare Act thing.\u201d\n\nOne of the navigators on site was able to get Vargas enrolled, and like him, 13 others were also assisted though not all of them enrolled in a health plan by the day\u2019s end.\n\n\u201cYou have some people that don\u2019t have computers, that don\u2019t have access to computers, or that are not computer literate\u2014at least not enough to walk through the whole enrollment process alone,\u201d Huling said. \u201cThe process can take anywhere from 15 minutes to an hour, so imagine the person who isn\u2019t computer literate. How long do you think it would take them?\u201d she asked.\n\nShem Hing, 34, who works for the Brooklyn Chamber of Commerce as a navigator at two Brooklyn public libraries\u2014in Sunset Park and Kings Highway\u2014says he deals with all kinds of people and not with people who fit a specific stereotype associated with government assistance.\n\n\u201cI meet all kinds of people here, very interesting people,\u201d Hing said. \u201cI\u2019ve met businessmen, musicians, artists, immigrants. People who work, people who don\u2019t work.\u201d\n\nThe common denominator, he says, is always that \u201cI could help them.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know it\u2019s busy here, but it\u2019s not enough.,\u201d Hing added. \u201cWe want to get people coverage.\u201d\n\nThe deadline to enroll for coverage that starts on Jan. 1 is Dec. 15, and those who don\u2019t sign up and remain uninsured will have until March 31 to enroll or risk being fined as much as 1 percent of their income.\n\nFor more information on available counseling schedules through the Brooklyn Public Library System and the Brooklyn Chamber of Commerce, please refer to this link.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "affordable care act,brooklyn,christ temple united baptist church,coney island,deborah carter,frank mason,gravesend houses,health,healthcare,marlboro,medicaid,medicare,national action network,new york,obamacare,quinnie huling,south brooklyn,brooklyn life,health care reform,politics", "framework": "Alkivia Framework 0.8", "generator": "WooFramework 5.5.3", "description": "Computer glitches matter but a lack of education is the biggest challenge ahead of the Affordable Healthcare Act.", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0; maximum-scale=1.0; user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca068\"", "article_summary": "Queenie Huling, 65, the President of NAN South Brooklyn, organized the South Brooklyn event with the help of Reverend Frank Mason, who leads Christ Temple United.\nThe event, which was sponsored by the National Action Network of South Brooklyn Chapter, a civil rights organization founded in 1991 by Reverend Al Sharpton, is one of a series of three that will be taking place in South Brooklyn in the next few months.\nAt least that\u2019s the impression that The Brooklyn Ink gathered from a visit to an information session this week about the Affordable Care Act held in South Brooklyn.\nFor more information on available counseling schedules through the Brooklyn Public Library System and the Brooklyn Chamber of Commerce, please refer to this link.\nThe other reason may be the complexity of the insurance system and widespread ignorance about how it works."}
