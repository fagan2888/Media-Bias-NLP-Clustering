A year ago, the medical center was more than $5 million in the hole, and medical associates was flush only because of a big payment from the federal government for effectively using electronic medical records, said Anthony Wagner, chief business officer for the health system and Georgia Regents University.\n\nThe health system was \u201csignificantly underwater,\u201d he said. This year, it is $8.2 million ahead, though not quite up to the $10.6 million it had budgeted, Wagner said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had good growth for this year and good year-over-year growth,\u201d he said.\n\nUniversity System of Georgia Chancellor Hank Huckaby, who sits on the board, concurred.\n\n\u201cThis is a tremendous turnaround from one year ago,\u201d he said.\n\nGRU President Ricardo Azziz, who chairs the boards, said the administration set \u201caggressive goals\u201d for this fiscal year.\n\n\u201cAnd we\u2019re almost there,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile expenses were a little high, many expenses \u2013 such as for increased information technology related to coding changes \u2013 were \u201cfrontloaded\u201d in the first half of the year and will smooth out going forward, Wagner said.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re in a good position to make a strong run in the second half of the year,\u201d he said.\n\nThe environment will not be helpful, however, Azziz said. Rating agencies like Fitch Ratings and Moody\u2019s have negative outlooks for nonprofit hospitals this year, he said.\n\n\u201cThese are not good times for nonprofit hospitals and health systems,\u201d Azziz said. That the health system is doing well in spite of conditions is \u201ca tribute to the team on the ground,\u201d he said. Because of state opposition to the Affordable Care Act, with Georgia refusing to expand Medicaid, \u201cwe will end up with the cost and the burden of ACA without any additional funding,\u201d Azziz said.\n\nThe health system is also increasingly being called upon to help support the rest of the university because of cuts in federal and state funding. Since fiscal 2009, state support has been cut by $76 million, nearly one-third of its state funding, Azziz said.\n\n\u201cAll of these things are really headwinds of significance,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Augusta, georgia, newspaper, classifieds, augusta chronicle news, news, sports, entertainment, local information, masters, golf, masters tournament, local businesses, shopping, daily deals, north augusta, SRS, south carolina, CSRA, aiken, Health, Metro, Latest News, Tom Corwin", "og": {"site_name": "The Augusta Chronicle", "description": "During meetings of the health system board and the board that governs its medical center, a much rosier financial picture appeared.", "title": "Georgia Regents turns around finances", "url": "http://chronicle.augusta.com/news/health/2014-01-23/georgia-regents-turns-around-finances", "image": "http://chronicle.augusta.com/sites/default/files/images/sms-default-facebook-share.png", "type": "article"}, "description": "Augusta Georgia\u2019s source for News, Entertainment, Sports, Weather, Classifieds, Jobs, Autos, Real Estate and Masters information from The Augusta Chronicle, chronicle.augusta.com"}, "article_summary": "Since fiscal 2009, state support has been cut by $76 million, nearly one-third of its state funding, Azziz said.\nThat the health system is doing well in spite of conditions is \u201ca tribute to the team on the ground,\u201d he said.\nDuring meetings of the health system board and the board that governs its medical center, a much rosier financial picture appeared.\nThe health system was \u201csignificantly underwater,\u201d he said.\nThe health system is also increasingly being called upon to help support the rest of the university because of cuts in federal and state funding."}
