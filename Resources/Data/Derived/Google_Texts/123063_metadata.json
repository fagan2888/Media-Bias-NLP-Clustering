The way it\u2019s done was in full view last weekend, when sixteen Republican hopefuls pressed into the Crowne Plaza Hotel in Nashua, for two days of Q & A and coffee huddles with local voters. It was democracy at its best.\n\nSince 1952, winning the presidency almost always starts with a win in the New Hampshire primary, the first in the nation by law. In the months ahead, thousands of New Hampshire voters will flock to bars, diners, neighbor\u2019s homes, and packed gatherings like the Nashua event to size up candidates. They will know more about the candidates than anyone else in America. Last weekend they heard that Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker buys his shirts at Kohl\u2019s and former Hewlett Packard CEO Carly Fiorina started out as an office temp and lost a\n\ndaughter to addiction.\n\nHere\u2019s what came out of it:\n\nThere will be no Jeb Bush coronation. Though the former Florida governor (son of one president, brother of another) is leading in the polls, it\u2019s not by much. \u201cNo one\u2019s giving it to me,\u201d Bush said. There was less enthusiasm for Bush than his closest rival in the polls, Walker.\n\nWalker\u2019s got momentum. Since 2010, he has waged three victorious battles for his state\u2019s governorship, including defeating a recall effort mounted by public employees\u2019 unions, which bussed in 100,000 agitators to disrupt the state capitol.\n\nWalker told the New Hampshire crowd that when Wisconsin voters elected\n\nhim and a Republican majority in the legislature, he had to \u201cgo big and go bold,\u201d not \u201cjust nibble around the edges.\u201d Walker ended tenure and seniority, so that teachers would be hired on merit and paid on performance. Reading scores and graduation rates shot up. He also turned a multi-billion state deficit into a surplus without raising taxes. As Walker recited these facts, the Nashua audience\n\nwent wild.\n\nThe other applause getters were three first-term U.S. Senators: Ted Cruz of Texas, Rand Paul of Kentucky, and Marco Rubio of Florida. All three are gaining in the polls, and are way ahead of Republicans who have run for president before and are trying it again , like Rick Perry from Texas and Mike Huckabee from Arkansas. Youth seems to be an advantage.\n\nPerry cautioned that \u201cwe\u2019ve spent eight years with a young, inexperienced United States Senator,\u201d meaning Obama. But Cruz is no novice. He served as Solicitor General of Texas and argued nine cases before the United States Supreme Court.\n\nThe Nashua crowd cheered Cruz\u2019s promise to repeal \u201cevery last page of\n\nObamacare\u201d and end Common Core. The audience erupted again when he attacked confirming New Yorker Loretta Lynch as the next U.S. Attorney General. Weeks earlier, Lynch had testified that she supports whatever Obama does on immigration by executive order. Cruz says he can\u2019t stand by while Congress\u2019s lawmaking power is usurped. Jeb Bush took the opposite stand, and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell says she\u2019ll be approved soon.\n\nRubio flaunted his youth (age 43) , as he always does, telling crowds they don\u2019t want to go back to \u201cyesterday.\u201d But the room fell quiet when he suggested a pre-emptive strike against Iran now might be better than allowing Iran to get the bomb.\n\nThe sixteen presidential hopefuls also included two non-politicians, Fiorina and deal maker Donald Trump. Fiorina isn\u2019t showing in the polls yet, but the Nashua crowd cheered her for making it to the top on her own, not on her husband\u2019s coattails like Hillary. Political strategists are talking about her for vice presidential nominee.\n\nTrump\u2019s largely dismissed as a celebrity bomb thrower, but Iowa insiders who came to Nashua say the he\u2019s \u201cin it to win it.\u201d He\u2019s hired the team that won the Iowa caucus in 2012 for Rick Santorum, beating out Mitt Romney. Trump cracked that \u201cpoliticians are never going to solve the problems we have.\u201d We\u2019re getting our clocks cleaned by China, Japan and Mexico because U.S. negotiators don\u2019t know how to make a good deal. The tycoon\u2019s got one constituency nailed\n\ndown. The hotel waitresses lined up to get pictures with him, while ignoring the other contenders.\n\nBetsy McCaughey is author of \u201cBeating Obamacare 2014\u201d (Regnery, 2014) and a senior fellow at the London Center for Policy Analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "Sizing up the contenders in New Hampshire.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Sizing up the contenders in New Hampshire.", "title": "BETSY MCCAUGHEY: Democracy at its best", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/apr/24/betsy-mccaughey-democracy-its-best/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/04/19/4_192015_new-hampshire8201.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/04/19/4_192015_new-hampshire8201.jpg", "description": "Sizing up the contenders in New Hampshire.", "card": "summary", "title": "BETSY MCCAUGHEY: Democracy at its best"}, "Author": "Betsy McCaughey", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Politics, Nashua, Carly Fiorina, Scott Walker, Jeb Bush"}, "article_summary": "Betsy McCaughey is author of \u201cBeating Obamacare 2014\u201d (Regnery, 2014) and a senior fellow at the London Center for Policy Analysis.\nThere was less enthusiasm for Bush than his closest rival in the polls, Walker.\nIn the months ahead, thousands of New Hampshire voters will flock to bars, diners, neighbor\u2019s homes, and packed gatherings like the Nashua event to size up candidates.\nIt was democracy at its best.\nThough the former Florida governor (son of one president, brother of another) is leading in the polls, it\u2019s not by much."}
