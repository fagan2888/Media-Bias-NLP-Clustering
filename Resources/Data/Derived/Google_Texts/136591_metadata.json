I don\u2019t think it is more dangerous than alcohol,\u201d the president said an interview with The New Yorker.\n\nSmoking marijuana is \u201cnot something I encourage, and I\u2019ve told my daughters I think it\u2019s a bad idea, a waste of time, not very healthy,\u201d Obama said.\n\nObama\u2019s administration has given states permission to experiment with marijuana regulation, and newly passed laws in Colorado and Washington legalizing marijuana recently went into effect. The president said it was important for the legalization of marijuana to go forward in those states to avoid a situation in which only a few are punished while a large portion of people have broken the law at one time or another.\n\nThe president said he is troubled at the disproportionate number of arrests and imprisonments of minorities for marijuana use. \u201cMiddle-class kids don\u2019t get locked up for smoking pot, and poor kids do,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd African-American kids and Latino kids are more likely to be poor and less likely to have the resources and the support to avoid unduly harsh penalties.\u201d\n\nHe said in the interview that users shouldn\u2019t be locked up for long stretches of time when people writing drug laws \u201chave probably done the same thing.\u201d\n\nBut Obama urged a cautious approach to changing marijuana laws, saying that people who think legalizing pot will solve social problems are \u201cprobably overstating the case.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd the experiment that\u2019s going to be taking place in Colorado and Washington is going to be, I think, a challenge,\u201d the president said.\n\nEthan Nadelmann, the executive director of the Drug Policy Alliance praised Obama\u2019s words, saying his use of the word \u201cimportant\u201d about the new Colorado and Washington laws \u201creally puts the wind in the sails of the movement to end marijuana prohibition.\n\nCritics of the new laws raise concerns about public health and law enforcement, asking whether wide availability of the drug will lead to more underage drug use, more cases of driving while high and more crime.\n\n\u201cSaying that marijuana is not as harmful as alcohol is like that rattlesnakes are not as harmful as cobras,\u201d said Dr. Jeff Reynolds, who leads Long Island\u2019s Council on Alcoholism and Drug Dependence.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got a public health challenge on our hands, and the president just made our jobs a lot harder.\u201d\n\nA recent Gallup poll found for the first time ever a majority of people think the drug should be legalized altogether.\n\nOn Long Island, the reaction to Obama\u2019s remarks drew mixed reviews.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t approve of the message that would be sending to the younger people in our society,\u201d Amanda Olcott, of Garden City, told CBS 2\u2019s Jennifer McLogan.\n\n\u201cI feel like marijuana is a natural thing,\u201d said Matt Vincelli, of Garden City. \u201cIt does grow from the earth. It\u2019s not like it\u2019s methamphetamine or something.\u201d\n\nSome complained about the nation\u2019s inconsistency, with one state sending a joint smoker to prison and another declaring pot legal.\n\n\u201cOur country\u2019s in a hypocritical state,\u201d said Aron Cohen, of Great Neck. \u201cWe\u2019re sending so many mixed signals to our citizens, to kids.\u201d\n\nPastor Rassan Hoskins agrees with Obama that current anti-drug laws disproportionately punish the poor in black and Latino communities.\n\n\u201cPot in and of itself, I don\u2019t think that it rises to the level of illegality,\u201d he said. \u201cWhile I\u2019m a minister, so I don\u2019t think there necessarily has to be a need to get high at all.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, children McLogan spoke with said their parents, like Obama, are urging them not to smoke marijuana.\n\n\u201cYou should only do it if it\u2019s a medicinal purpose,\u201d said\n\nGov. Andrew Cuomo announced his support for medical marijuana in his State of the State address earlier this month.\n\nThe plan would allow 20 hospitals to dispense marijuana to people suffering from cancer and some other diseases under state Department of Health regulations.\n\nIf it happens, New York would join 21 other states, including New Jersey and Connecticut, that already allow some form of medical marijuana.\n\nCuomo\u2019s medical marijuana plan will be enacted by executive order, not legislation, and will be more restrictive than programs in some other states like California.\n\nYou May Also Be Interested In These Stories\n\n(TM and \u00a9 Copyright 2014 CBS Radio Inc. and its relevant subsidiaries.
