In King v. Burwell, the court \u2014 if it follows the plain text of the law, which says that only individuals purchasing coverage on an \u201cexchange established by the state\u201d are eligible for federal insurance subsidies \u2014 could cause disruption to individuals in the 36 states that did not establish a state exchange, and instead rely on the federally run healthcare.gov exchange. For this reason, many observers have argued that conservatives need to present an alternative vision of health reform before the court rules.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nI wholeheartedly agree with that position. However, I fear that many of the proposals being discussed by Republicans in Washington do not truly represent conservative reform.\n\nTake one major issue related to Obamacare: taxes. The law is chock full of them \u2014 no fewer than 18 revenue raisers totaling over $1 trillion through 2022.Yet several alternative proposals being discussed by Republicans don\u2019t actually repeal the law\u2019s tax increases. Instead, they repeal the law\u2019s tax increases, only to replace them with new revenue hikes. So, rather than raise taxes by more than $1 trillion, as Obamacare did, these plans raise taxes by perhaps, say, \u201conly\u201d $500 billion.\n\nThis puts Republicans in the positions of being \u201ccheap\u201d Democrats, or Democrat-lite. We\u2019ll raise taxes \u2014 but just \u2026 less than Obamacare. We\u2019ll spend hundreds of billions on new entitlement programs \u2014 but just \u2026 less than Obamacare.\n\nBut the problem with programs that look like Obamacare is that they bring with them many of Obamacare\u2019s problems. Remember when the Congressional Budget Office concluded that Obamacare will result in more than 2 million Americans working fewer hours, or leaving the labor force altogether? That\u2019s because the law\u2019s insurance subsidies are structured in ways that will cause individuals to work fewer hours, keeping their income low to maintain eligibility for subsidized insurance. Some so-called conservative health plans also have characteristics that will discourage work \u2014 even if perhaps less than Obamacare does.\n\nSo why talk about \u201cconservative\u201d health care reform if our vision turns us into cheap liberals? Why complain that Obamacare is expanding welfare and dependency, only to propose a similar \u2014 albeit smaller \u2014 program that could well have the same effects? If conservatives oppose Obamacare\u2019s tax increases on the middle class, then why did one \u201cconservative\u201d health adviser propose accelerating the law\u2019s tax on health plans by phasing it in sooner?\n\nThe reality is that while Beltway insiders in the elite salons of Washington can do and say whatever they want, the American people know better. A majority of voters \u2014 and even larger majorities of conservative and Republican voters \u2014 believe that \u201cany replacement of Obamacare must repeal all of the Obamacare taxes and not just replace them with other taxes.\u201d In other words, the voters won\u2019t be fooled by quasi-liberal health plans masquerading in conservative clothing.\n\nThe other good news is that truly conservative health plans exist. Last year, I outlined a plan with America Next, the conservative policy group I founded. The plan focuses like a laser beam on controlling the health care issue that matters most to Americans \u2014 skyrocketing health costs. The plan empowers the states to enact reforms that can bring down costs, while also guaranteeing access for individuals with pre-existing conditions. Rather than stifling states with additional regulations from Washington, the America Next plan offers them incentives to improve their insurance markets in ways that offer more choices and lower costs. As a result, Americans should benefit from new avenues to buy portable health insurance they can own themselves \u2014 through their church, alumni group or trade association \u2014 and lower premiums, too. In fact, the Congressional Budget Office previously analyzed reforms similar to those in the America Next plan and found that they could reduce individual health insurance premiums by thousands of dollars per family.\n\nI recognize there are other good conservative plans out there \u2014 and that\u2019s great. For instance, the Republican Study Committee proposed reforming the tax treatment of health insurance without repealing and replacing the tax increases in Obamacare. We should have a robust debate and show both the Supreme Court and the American people that there are better ways to enact true reforms. But I don\u2019t believe that any plan that repeals and replaces Obamacare\u2019s trillions in taxes and spending is a conservative alternative \u2014 and the American people agree.\n\nRecently, the left gave us an instructive lesson on why this debate about a conservative alternative is so important. The advocacy group Families USA released a report calling for a veritable orgy of new Obamacare-related spending \u2014 new subsidies, insurance mandates, even a proposal to extend subsidized insurance to illegal immigrants. It\u2019s an important reminder, first that the left will always want more government intrusion in health care, and second that conservatives can never hope to outspend the left by acting as cheap liberals. That\u2019s why it\u2019s so important for our party to outline a conservative \u2014 repeat, conservative \u2014 vision for health care.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO Magazine", "description": "Proposals by Washington Republicans do not truly represent conservative reform.", "title": "The GOP Mustn\u2019t Offer Obamacare Lite", "url": "http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2015/02/gop-obamacare-alternative-114820.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2015/02/01/150201_doctor_gty_629.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Obamacare,Health Care,Republicans,Opinion,Bobby Jindal,GOP,Affordable Care Act", "twitter": {"site": "@politicomag", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politicomag"}, "description": "Proposals by Washington Republicans do not truly represent conservative reform.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Some so-called conservative health plans also have characteristics that will discourage work \u2014 even if perhaps less than Obamacare does.\nRecently, the left gave us an instructive lesson on why this debate about a conservative alternative is so important.\nTake one major issue related to Obamacare: taxes.\nThe other good news is that truly conservative health plans exist.\nSo why talk about \u201cconservative\u201d health care reform if our vision turns us into cheap liberals?"}
