There is a number of staff who have not received a paycheck since the previous pay period. So, we'll go in, meet with the staff, meet with the residents. We'll provide the assurance that they need, specifically the staff that they need to keep coming to work. We'll get them paid and we'll take care of the residents.\"\n\nHe says while the state takes operational control it'll also be seeking other parties which might be interested in taking over the facility to operate it.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "video", "description": "State agency takes over Deseret Health Care facility due to company's insolvency.", "language": "english", "author": "Chris Frank", "og": {"description": "State agency takes over Deseret Health Care facility due to company's insolvency.", "title": "State takes over Wichita Deseret Senior Care facility", "url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/State-takes-over-Wichita-Deseret-Senior-Care-facility-302493981.html", "image": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/445/C49/445C49F2227341CFB570E1CE6D593BCA", "video": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/DAF/2F1/DAF2F183B5684BD2B19CE57E08BBC60D.mp4", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.kake.com", "description": "State agency takes over Deseret Health Care facility due to company's insolvency.", "title": "State takes over Wichita Deseret Senior Care facility", "url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/State-takes-over-Wichita-Deseret-Senior-Care-facility-302493981.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/deseret.jpg", "creator": "@KAKEnews", "site": "@KAKEnews", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "video_type": "video/mp4", "video_height": 288, "keywords": "State takes over Wichita Deseret Senior Care facility", "google-site-verification": "H0mev8O__gMqb34WcvOyZgBXFMRQZvDAQ0YTSGJ9hGQ", "video_width": 512, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "State takes over Wichita Deseret"}, "article_summary": "The Kansas Department of Aging and Disability Services is taking control of the Deseret Health Care facility in Southeast Wichita.\nAbout the same time last week several Deseret employees contacted KAKE news that Deseret didn't pay them which we reported on last Friday.\nEmployees then expressed their concern about their own financial problems with not getting paid but also concern for the future of the care facility and their job future.\nHe says while the state takes operational control it'll also be seeking other parties which might be interested in taking over the facility to operate it.\nAgency Commissioner Joe Ewert says, \"The facility ownership over the operations, Deseret Health Group, contacted us last week and indicated to us they were insolvent.\""}
