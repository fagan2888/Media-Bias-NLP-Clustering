Provo, Utah, and Gainesville, Florida are not far behind.\n\nSLIDESHOW: The 10 Best Cities for Jobs That Let You Have a Life\n\nThe 10 best cities for a good work and life balance are spread around the country, mainly in the Midwest, in Florida, in the South and out West. None is on the East Coast.\n\nTo compile its annual list, NerdWallet took into consideration such criteria as average hours worked per week in each city, length of time of the average daily commute, the median income for full-time workers, and the median rent in each city.\n\nIn the 10 cities that scored best, the average resident works less than 34 hours a week, while the mean travel time to work is under 18 minutes. Nationally, 11 percent of employees work more than 50 hours a week. Keep in mind, of course, that a large part of these cities\u2019 workforces are made up of state university employees \u2013 i.e., public workers who may well be members of job-protecting unions.\n\nRelated: Lie on a Resum\u00e9 and You May Lose More Than a Job\n\n\u201cAmericans spend more time at the office than most workers in other countries,\u201d noted NerdWallet in its study, citing a well-known conclusion. However, people \u201cwho seek a healthy work-life balance can reduce stress and improve the quality of their lives.\u201d\n\nAll of the cities that scraped the bottom of the barrel in this study are either on the East Coast or in California.\n\nHere are the six worst cities for work/life balance:\n\nDale City, Virginia, near Washington D.C.
