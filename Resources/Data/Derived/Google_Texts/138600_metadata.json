But an exchange official said Thursday that the cause was most likely a mistake by a call center worker.\n\nThe breach occurred two weeks ago after a worker at the exchange\u2019s call center put notepads containing callers\u2019 names, birth dates and Social Security numbers into a backpack and left the call center. The backpack was later discovered outside a Hartford deli, where the worker had been waiting for a ride. He told officials with Maximus, the company that runs the call center, that he\u2019d accidentally left without the bag.\n\nIt was a policy violation for the worker to take personally identifiable information out of the office, said Virginia Lamb, general counsel of Access Health CT, the state's exchange.\n\n\u201cHe did have his reasons,\u201d she told members of the exchange\u2019s board during a meeting Thursday. \u201cHe didn\u2019t have at the time a place to lock up his data. He put it in his backpack.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was a very bad decision,\u201d Lamb added. \u201cBut so far at least, we have not seen evidence of criminality.\u201d\n\nThe worker was relatively new at the call center and had finished his training at the end of April, Lamb said. At the time of the breach, he hadn\u2019t yet been assigned a desk.\n\nThe worker is currently on administrative leave. Lamb said it\u2019s the policy of both Access Health and Maximus to terminate a worker who violates policies that lead to a data breach, but she said the company wanted to finish the investigation first and cooperate with the police department.\n\nSince the breach occurred, Maximus has stopped using paper in its call center and has put wipe boards in each terminal. Workers sometimes write down callers\u2019 information because they use two separate computer systems, and writing things down allows them to avoid asking callers for information twice, exchange officials have said.\n\nThe exchange sent letters last Thursday and Friday to 395 people affected by the breach, offering them credit monitoring, credit resolution services and identity theft insurance. People were also offered a phone number to call, and 44 have called so far, exchange Chief Operating Officer Peter Van Loon said.\n\nSome of the letters were returned as undeliverable, Van Loon said. The exchange is trying to find accurate addresses for those people.\n\nExchange board members raised questions about how the breach could have occurred and about what happened after it was discovered. The person who found the backpack notified the office of his state representative, Jay Case of Winsted, and brought it to the Legislative Office Building. A GOP staffer then notified the exchange.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never heard of a situation where you find something and your impulse is, \u2018I\u2019ll bring it to my state representative,\u2019\u201d board member Dr. Robert Scalettar said.\n\nBoard member Bob Tessier focused on Maximus.\n\n\u201cHave they given us any explanation of how someone could engage in this kind of blatant violation, not only of the rules and the terms of this person\u2019s employment, but frankly any kind of common sense?\u201d he asked, adding that it appeared no one was supervising.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t say we have a good explanation,\u201d Lamb said.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Health Care, Access Health CT, Affordable Care Act, data breach, Obamacare", "original-source": "http://ctmirror.org/2014/06/19/irs-hartford-police-conducting-criminal-investigation-on-access-health-data-breach/", "og": {"site_name": "The CT Mirror", "description": "The Internal Revenue Service and Hartford police are conducting a criminal investigation of the data breach involving information on clients of Connecticut\u2019s health insurance exchange.
