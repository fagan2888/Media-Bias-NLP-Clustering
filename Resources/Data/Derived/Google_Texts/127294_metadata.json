Luis Guti\u00e9rrez, a leading voice in the House in the push for immigration reform for years, said Monday that opponents of President Barack Obama\u2019s new executive order, which could suspend deportation for some 5 million immigrants, are trying to scare people into not applying for the relief.\n\n\u201cThe fear campaign is just starting,\u201d Guti\u00e9rrez said during a press call. \u201cThey are trying to keep our immigrants from signing up just like they were trying to keep people from signing up for ObamaCare.\u201d\n\nThe Illinois Democrat, who as far back as 2010 has pushed the president \u2013 in the absence of congressional action \u2013 to use executive powers to give temporary relief from deportation to millions of undocumented immigrants, criticized some Republicans who have in recent days suggested that immigrants should not apply for a benefit they say stems from an act that will not stand court challenges.\n\n\"There's going to be fear-mongering from the Republican Party,\u201d Guti\u00e9rrez said in the call he held with fellow Democrats Sen. Robert Menendez of New Jersey and Rep. Zoe Lofgren of California.\n\nGuti\u00e9rrez said he is now on a mission to spur as many of the estimated 5 million undocumented immigrants who could qualify for the three-year suspension of deportation to apply. He said he will be traveling across the country to spread the word about who qualifies for relief from deportation \u2013 a benefit that also allows people to obtain a work permit and often also a driver's license \u2013 and to encourage people to submit applications.\n\n\u201cWe received a couple of thousand phone calls,\u201d he said of his staff. \u201cThey want to know if the president\u2019s action applies to them, their families, their next-door neighbors.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cWe\u2019re telling people to be patient and work with us to learn all the details.\u201d\n\nMenendez, who long has led the effort in the Senate to pass a comprehensive immigration reform bill, said that the president's executive order, which calls for tighter border enforcement as well as protection from deportation among other things, falls short of what he and Guti\u00e9rrez and others had hoped for, but it still \u201cis a game-changer for millions.\u201d\n\n\u201cMore families will be able to stay together without fear of deportation,\u201d Menendez said.\n\n\n\nHe too noted that now supporters of the president\u2019s executive action must put their energy into making sure people sign up, as well as continuing to push for Congress to pass a reform bill that would establish more permanent solutions.\n\nBoth Menendez and Guti\u00e9rrez stressed that the executive order only temporarily addresses the almost 12 million people who live in the United States illegally. They said that only Congress, by way of immigration reform, can put forth an enduring solution.\n\nElizabeth Llorente is the Politics Editor/Senior Reporter for Fox News Latino, and can be reached at Elizabeth.Llorente@Foxnewslatino.com.
