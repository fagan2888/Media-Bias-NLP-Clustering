When the sensitive, cynical Milo moves in with his uptight, volatile sister and her sweet, uncomplicated husband, Lance (Luke Wilson), the siblings are forced to confront the personal traumas that have kept them apart for so long.\n\nDespite its darkness, \u201cThe Skeleton Twins\u201d is funny and honest and bittersweet. Hader and Wiig transform from comics to full dramatic actors with a wide range and depth, building on their on-screen chemistry from \u201cSNL.\u201d In an interview with Salon, director Craig Johnson discussed his vision for the film, the role that comedy and improv played in it and how Hader and Wiig joined the cast.\n\nYou mentioned that your family didn\u2019t have the same types of issues as Maggie and Milo. So then \u2014 where did you get the idea and source material? (Warning: spoiler alert ahead!)\n\nWell, you know, we all have\u2013 every family is weird, you know, on some level. And I think that, you know, I like my family a lot but it doesn\u2019t mean we don\u2019t have our own quirks and idiosyncrasies and struggles and all of that but you know, the idea just came\u2026My co-writer Mark Heyman and I were in film school actually and a lot of these Sundance movies were coming out at the time \u2014 \u201cThe Squid and the Whale,\u201d \u201cMe, You, and Everyone We Know,\u201d \u2014 that were really inspiring us and we just sat down one day and we want to write a movie and we want it to be funny, we want it to be a little sad, sometimes at the same time, like these movies we love. But what do we want to write about? We just sort of threw around ideas and subject matter, and one of the things that Mark talked about was a student-teacher relationship that went down at his high school that he went to, and he knew the teacher who was very beloved, and he knew the student, and it was a real kind of complex sort of issue. That sort of a student-teacher relationship is very black-and-white, not cool, everyone knows that\u2013 but we were very interested in exploring that idea of a student-teacher relationship that had some nuance and complexity to it. Then we kind of built it out from there and the character of the student just kind of\u2013 we gave him a sister, and then we made that whole thing backstory, basically, and we became more interested in the sibling relationship.\n\nIn this movie, there are so many traumatic things that happen to these people that it could have easily become manufactured or melodramatic. Instead, the tragedies felt real. How did you keep that from happening?\n\nYeah, totally. Well, there\u2019s two things: I think these tragic events create a domino-effect and one thing leads to another, and I think it doesn\u2019t feel like too much or feel like it\u2019s overwhelming you with melodrama because it just sort of parsed out incrementally, what happened and what went on.\n\nI feel like the whole theme of the movie is dealing with dark shit with a sense of humor. That\u2019s how I get through dark stuff\u2026I laugh at things that scare me. My sister does, too. I have a sister who is two years younger than me and we\u2019re very very close and we connect with this weird off-beat sense of humor, and when we\u2019re going through dark times, that still can kind of connect us. And that was a major element to the movie, to explore the relationship between siblings who go through really dark stuff.\n\nComedy is often used as a way to talk about tragedy \u2014 something that comedians like Louis C.K. and Tig Notaro do so well, for example, and what made them so popular.\n\nThat\u2019s kind of what the movie\u2019s about, honestly. I think it works so well because people relate to it. Everyone deals with dark stuff in their lives. And I think that if you don\u2019t laugh in the face of darkness, you\u2019re just done for. To talk more just about the tone of the movie \u2014 the tightrope between the funny and the sad \u2014 I think that\u2019s just how life is. I wanted the movie to feel like real life and real life is never split into genres. It\u2019s never a tragedy and it\u2019s never a comedy; it\u2019s often both, sometimes in the same day, sometimes within the same argument with people. I love that. You bring up Louis C.K. and Tig Notaro, and I think that they\u2019re so effective because they give you a release mechanism. It\u2019s like, \u201cIt\u2019s okay now.\u201d It makes you able to deal with the darkness and the sadness because I\u2019m going to talk about it in this funny way that rings true to people.", "article_metadata": {"description": "\"SNL\" alumns Bill Hader and Kristen Wiig co-star in the director's sophomore film, which premiered at Sundance", "title": "\u201cThe Skeleton Twins\u201d director Craig Johnson on comedy, tragedy and Bill Hader", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "\"SNL\" alumns Bill Hader and Kristen Wiig co-star in the director's sophomore film, which premiered at Sundance", "title": "\u201cThe Skeleton Twins\u201d director Craig Johnson on comedy, tragedy and Bill Hader", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/01/20/the_skeleton_twins_director_craig_johnson_on_comedy_tragedy_and_bill_hader/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/01/skeletontwins.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "\"SNL\" alumns Bill Hader and Kristen Wiig co-star in the director's sophomore film, which premiered at Sundance", "title": "\u201cThe Skeleton Twins\u201d director Craig Johnson on comedy, tragedy and Bill Hader", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/01/skeletontwins.png", "creator": "@prachigu", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Prachi Gupta", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, bill hader, Comedy, craig johnson, Drama, dramedy, Film, kristen wiig, luke wilson, Movies, SNL, Sundance, sundance 2014, the skeleton twins", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf282\"", "article_summary": "Topics: bill hader, Comedy, craig johnson, Drama, dramedy, Film, kristen wiig, luke wilson, Movies, SNL, Sundance, sundance 2014, the skeleton twins, Entertainment NewsWhen it\u2019s released in theaters, audiences will be stunned by the emotional power of \u201cThe Skeleton Twins,\u201d director Craig Johnson\u2019s sophomore film that stars \u201cSNL\u201d alumn Bill Hader in his most serious, emotionally complex role yet.\nMilo and Maggie, played by Hader and fellow \u201cSNL\u201d alumn Kristen Wiig, are estranged adult siblings brought together when Milo attempts suicide.\nComedy is often used as a way to talk about tragedy \u2014 something that comedians like Louis C.K.\nIt\u2019s never a tragedy and it\u2019s never a comedy; it\u2019s often both, sometimes in the same day, sometimes within the same argument with people.\nDespite its darkness, \u201cThe Skeleton Twins\u201d is funny and honest and bittersweet."}
