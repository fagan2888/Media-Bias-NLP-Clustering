OREGON CITY, Ore. (AP) - Two people were killed Sunday when they were hit by a passenger train south of Oregon City.

The Clackamas County Sheriff’s Office says an Amtrak train traveling from Eugene to Portland struck two people on the railroad tracks around 11 a.m.

Deputy Marcus Mendoza said in a statement that initial interviews suggest the deaths were suicides. The collision occurred in an area that is closed to pedestrians.

Authorities did not immediately identify the victims.

Amtrak spokesman Mike Tolbert says 38 passengers were aboard the train. No injuries were reported. Tolbert says the train traveled on to Portland by Sunday afternoon.

Law enforcement representatives from Amtrak and Union Pacific Railroad, which owns the tracks, are assisting with the sheriff’s office in the investigation.

Oregon City is about 15 miles south of Portland.
