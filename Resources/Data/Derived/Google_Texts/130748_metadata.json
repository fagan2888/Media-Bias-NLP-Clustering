And 8.2 million people could lose their insurance coverage if Republicans finally succeed (after trying dozens of times) in repealing the health care law, which could result in an estimated 9,800 deaths annually.\n\nThere\u2019s your real death panel. As Ted Cruz delivered his sermon announcing his candidacy for president from Liberty University this morning, he drew a rousing cheer from the audience when he said he\u2019d repeal Obamacare. Never mind that the GOP plan by Hatch-Upton-Burr to replace Obamacare will drive millions to tears as they would no longer be able to afford coverage.\n\nThe Ted Cruzes of the world should restrain their glee until they understand what taking away Obamacare will mean to Americans.\n\n57 percent of customers in the Obaamacare exchanges were previously uninsured. 24 to 27 million people would be uninsured over the next decade if it weren\u2019t for Obamacare. Obamacare will cost 20 percent less than originally projected. Almost 30 million people have become insured under Obamacare. Medical bills are now easier to pay thanks to Obamacare.\n\nThanks to Obamacare, millions of people can no longer be denied health care because of preexisting conditions, and women can\u2019t be charged more simply for being a woman. And for the first time since 2003, fewer adults are avoiding or delaying filling prescriptions or seeking medical care. They\u2019re also no longer skipping preventative care like flu shots, blood work, and cancer screenings because of cost.\n\nSo Ted Cruz can preach all he wants to the right-wing extremists about the evils of Obamacare, but it\u2019s made a positive difference in millions of American people\u2019s lives. Instead of orchestrating the anti-Obamacare shut down of our government, costing taxpayers billions, he could be working to improve the law, bringing health and well-being to millions more.\n\n[moko_youtube src=\u201ddRmYXEISW8I\u201d]\n\nH/T: Mother Jones", "article_metadata": {"description": "It's 5 years since Congress passed Obamacare and it was signed into law, so here are the 5 facts you MUST know to freak out republicans.", "generator": "Powered by Visual Composer - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.", "og": {"site_name": "Blue Nation Review", "description": "It's 5 years since Congress passed Obamacare and it was signed into law, so here are the 5 facts you MUST know to freak out republicans.", "title": "5 Facts on Obamacare's 5th Birthday That'll Make Republicans Sick", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://bluenationreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/obamacare.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-03-23T14:06:07-04:00", "url": "http://bluenationreview.com/obamacare-facts-ted-cruz-doesnt-want-know/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Blue Nation Review", "description": "It's 5 years since Congress passed Obamacare and it was signed into law, so here are the 5 facts you MUST know to freak out republicans.", "title": "5 Facts on Obamacare's 5th Birthday That'll Make Republicans Sick", "image": {"src": "http://bluenationreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/obamacare.jpg"}, "creator": "@JillEBond", "site": "@bluenationrev", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Blue Nation", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/bluenationreview", "section": "Economy", "tag": "barack obama,obamacare,ted cruz", "published_time": "2015-03-23T16:00:47-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-03-23T14:06:07-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, height=device-height, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Obamacare is working, whether Republicans like Ted Cruz want to admit it or not.\nAnd 8.2 million people could lose their insurance coverage if Republicans finally succeed (after trying dozens of times) in repealing the health care law, which could result in an estimated 9,800 deaths annually.\nThanks to Obamacare, millions of people can no longer be denied health care because of preexisting conditions, and women can\u2019t be charged more simply for being a woman.\nAs Ted Cruz delivered his sermon announcing his candidacy for president from Liberty University this morning, he drew a rousing cheer from the audience when he said he\u2019d repeal Obamacare.\nThey\u2019re also no longer skipping preventative care like flu shots, blood work, and cancer screenings because of cost."}
