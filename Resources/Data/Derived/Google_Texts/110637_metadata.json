But Georgetown wasted a late five-point edge before finishing with a spirited victory over another top program trying to move back into The Associated Press Top 25.\n\nAaron Bowen scored 22 points as Georgetown\u2019s reserves outscored Indiana\u2019s bench 24-2 in a game that drew just as many red-and-white clad fans from Indiana as the blue and gray of the Hoyas, who are based in Washington, D.C.\n\nGeorgetown took a 74-69 lead with 1:37 to go but Kevin \u201cYogi\u201d Ferrell scored Indiana\u2019s final eight points, including two 3-pointers \u2014 the second with 12 seconds to left \u2014 to tie it 77-all. The Hoosiers went nearly three minutes without scoring before Ferrell hit a pair of free throws with 87 seconds left to start the comeback.\n\nHanner Mosquera-Perea blocked Georgetown freshman L.J. Peak\u2019s layup attempt with about two seconds to go to send it to overtime.\n\nSmith opened the extra 5 minutes with a short jumper, Smith-Rivera made a 3 and Smith tipped in Smith-Rivera\u2019s shot to take a lead they never relinquished.\n\n\u201cI believe that no matter who\u2019s guarding me 1-on-1 that I can score on them.\u201d Smith said.\n\nFerrell led the Hoosiers with 27 points (5 of 10 on 3-pointers) but he missed two 3-point attempts and had two crucial turnovers in overtime. Indiana had 17 turnovers overall.\n\n\u201cWe play with a lot of freedom, but we\u2019ve got to continue making our decision-making better,\u201d Indiana coach Tom Crean said. \u201cToday turnovers were as big a part of losing the game as anything else.\u201d\n\nTroy Williams had 23 points and James Blackmon, Jr. made 6 of 12 3s in scoring 22 points for the fourth-highest scoring offense in the nation (86.3 coming in). Indiana was 13 of 31 from long range.\n\nTrailing 40-30 at halftime, the Hoyas abandoned an emphasis on the inside game that produced many missed layups in the opening 20 minutes and spread the offense with Smith \u2014 6-foot-10, 350-pounds \u2014 on the bench.\n\nSmith-Rivera made two 3s to start the half and a third about 4:30 in.\n\n\u201cIt was definitely a rhythm changer,\u201d Smith-Rivera said. \u201cIt changed how they were guarding us.\u201d\n\nBut Georgetown didn\u2019t make its move until Smith returned. The Hoyas scored 15 of the next 18 points \u2014 Blackmon\u2019s 3 was the Hoosiers only points \u2014 to take a 56-54 lead with 8:41 remaining, their first advantage since going up 10-9 at 13:21 of the first half.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Hoyas used a big second half run to catch the long-range shooting Hoosiers (10-3) but wasted a late five-point lead and needed overtime for a spirited victory over another top program trying to move back into the rankings.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "The Hoyas used a big second half run to catch the long-range shooting Hoosiers (10-3) but wasted a late five-point lead and needed overtime for a spirited victory over another top program trying to move back into the rankings.", "title": "D\u2019Vauntes Smith-Rivera scores 29 points as Georgetown tops Indiana in overtime", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/dec/27/dvauntes-smith-rivera-scores-29-points-georgetown-/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/12/27/indiana-georgetown-basketballjpeg-00d72.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/12/27/indiana-georgetown-basketballjpeg-00d72.jpg", "description": "The Hoyas used a big second half run to catch the long-range shooting Hoosiers (10-3) but wasted a late five-point lead and needed overtime for a spirited victory over another top program trying to mo", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "D\u2019Vauntes Smith-Rivera scores 29 points as Georgetown tops India"}, "Author": "Howie Rumberg", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Sports, Joshua Smith, Georgetown, D Vauntes Smith Rivera"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe131e\"", "article_summary": "Smith scored 12 of his 14 points after his return and D'Vauntes Smith-Rivera scored seven of his 29 points in overtime, leading Georgetown to a 91-87 victory over Indiana on Saturday in the Indeed Invitational at Madison Square Garden.\nNEW YORK \u2014 Georgetown tried early to counter the far-flinging Indiana Hoosiers by pounding the ball into their bigger frontcourt, led by behemoth center Joshua Smith.\nThat all changed when Smith made his first appearance of the second half, nearly six minutes in.\nFerrell led the Hoosiers with 27 points (5 of 10 on 3-pointers) but he missed two 3-point attempts and had two crucial turnovers in overtime.\n\u201cIt changed how they were guarding us.\u201dBut Georgetown didn\u2019t make its move until Smith returned."}
