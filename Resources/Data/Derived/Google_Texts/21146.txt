Brian Bearden scored 23 points Saturday night as the Germantown boys basketball team defeated Menomonee Falls, 83-47, for the Warhawks' 60th consecutive victory.

The two time defending Division 1 state champions moved within two of the state record winning streak of Whitefish Bay Dominican. Germantown plays at Cedarburg on Friday and against Dominican on Saturday in the NY2LA Sports Classic at Homestead.
