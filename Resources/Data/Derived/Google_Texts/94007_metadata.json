The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) estimates monthly health-care costs for the average American will be about $328 for a mid-tier silver plan, before subsidies.\n\nSales projections for the 2013 holiday season have been less than jolly before Wal-Mart\u2019s accusation. Last week, new figures from Gallup showed consumers plan to spend an average of $704 this year on gifts compared to $786 last year. Back in Septmeber, store traffic measurement firm ShopperTrak, predicted 2013 was supposed to be the weakest shopping since 2009. Retail sales for November and December, which is when the bulk of holiday shopping is done, were expected to rise 2.4%, less than the 3% increase in 2012 and the 4% increase in 2011 and 2010.\n\nChris Christopher, director of consumer economics at IHS, says potentially-higher insurance premium costs aren\u2019t the only reasons bringing down holiday sales projections this year. \u201cIt\u2019s clear consumers\u2019 mood and confidence took a hit in October due to the government shutdown; as did the bickering over the debt ceiling. Consumer sentiment fell a bit further in November as well. And related to the consumer mood, when they see the ACA site not operating very well, they think the government is not effective\u2014that is a big downer.\u201d\n\nPeter Galvin, senior vice president of marketing for SOASTA, a company that performs cloud and mobile testing for brands, says consumers\u2019 lack of confidence in the government has shoppers preferring to shop online over brick-and-mortar shops.\n\n\u201cWhen you see uncertainty in the marketplace on the economic side of things, it gives consumers pause,\u201d Galvin says. \u201cThey believe they may be able to get better deals online or can control the amount of money they spend and save on gas.\u201d\n\nJack Kleinhenz, chief economist at the National Retail Federation, says overall economic uncertainty will have an impact on consumer spending this holiday season. Health-care for many is a necessity, and not just an optional expense, he says.\n\n\u201cThere are so many uncertainties in the economy this year,\u201d Kleinhenz says. \u201cTo the effect of consumers receiving cancellation notices\u2026this is certainly politically a problem and health-care is likely to be more expensive. There are budget challenges for consumers. But at the same time, the economy has been performing.\u201d\n\nConsumers may decide to rein in their spending this year in anticipating of higher health-care cost next year, Christopher says. \u201cThere are a lot of people who think costs will increase next year and they are worried about that. But that is not what is driving the overall decline in holiday sales. There just has been a loss of consumer confidence and momentum over the past few months.\u201d\n\nComparatively, sales were weak in 2012, so spending may appear to be better this year, Christopher says.\n\n\u201cYear over year, things may not look so bad. Last year\u2019s spending was above water, but it still wasn\u2019t a great holiday season\u2014we had Hurricane Sandy, the fiscal cliff crisis, and there was the school shooting [at Sandy Hook] in Connecticut that kept people out of the malls for a bit,\u201d he says. \u201cSo it may be possible that holiday sales will look stronger than last year, but only because last year was very weak.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.modified": "2016-01-10 10:23:09 EST", "dcterms.abstract": "The upcoming holiday shopping season is expected to be slower than previous years, but is
