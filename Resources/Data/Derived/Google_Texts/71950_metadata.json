He reported the software entrepreneur had arrived in Portland to collaborate on a graphic novel about his time in Belize:\n\nOne of high-tech's most flamboyant and controversial luminaries had arrived in Portland, free of the Belize authorities he said were trying to kill him and focused on a variety of media projects he believed would help tell his life story.\n\nBut the man who made his fortune and his name with his eponymous anti-virus software said the one thing he was not here for is the vibrant, high-tech community.\n\nThat was another life. A life before guns, a tropical island, women and a life on the lam.\n\n1.

September -- The San Jose Mercury News reports McAfee plans to launch a new company to make the Internet hack-free but prefers Portland to Silicon Valley:\n\nWhile McAfee plans to launch his new company in or around Silicon Valley, he clearly prefers the relative quiet of Portland over Silicon Valley. \"The motto of the city is 'Keep Portland weird,' \" McAfee said. \"Well that fits right in with me. I'm not going to be living down here. It has changed a lot since last I worked here (26 years ago). It has grown. The traffic is nightmarish. It's just too busy for me.\n\n-- The Portland Business Journal reports McAfee says he passed on helping fix the Obamacare website. He told USA Today: \"They considered my solution political suicide.\"\n\nKeeping Portland Weird: John McAfee says he passed on fixing Obamacare site http://t.co/ZxPgpObnef via @PDXBizJournal \u2014 Wendy Culverwell (@PDXBIZWendy) October 25, 2013\n\n5. Nov. 25 -- McAfee is evicted from his luxury apartment, hit with a protective order by the landlord.
