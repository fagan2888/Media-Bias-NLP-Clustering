(Maybe carbon regulation will be added to the list; stay tuned.) For the most part, however, neither has gotten much respect. I think this may finally be changing on health reform, as the evidence piles up for a dramatic improvement in coverage in states that didn\u2019t obstruct the law. But financial reform is still unloved, attacked by the right as anti-business and by the left as too weak to work.\n\nThere is, however, an important new GAO report suggesting that reform is mattering a lot on one key hot-button issue: too big to fail. I\u2019m not, however, seeing much clear writing about this; the always excellent Mike Konczal is on the case, but I suspect that most readers won\u2019t know enough about the background to appreciate what\u2019s going on.\n\nSo here\u2019s an explanation. If you go back to what happened in 2008, you had a situation in which the impending collapse of some key financial institutions threatened to bring down the whole world economy. So they were bailed out \u2014 with many people complaining that the bailouts rewarded bad behavior. Indeed, some people \u2014 including me \u2014 argued for taking troubled banks into receivership, so that none of the bailout would go to stockholders. But key officials at Treasury argued that they didn\u2019t have the legal authority.\n\nThis episode created a concern: now that everyone knew that big financial institutions would be bailed out if they went bad, wouldn\u2019t this (a) give such too-big-to-fail institutions a continuing advantage, because their government guaranteed safety would make them able to borrow cheaply, and (b) encourage irresponsible behavior? And there was a fair bit of evidence for (a): large financial institutions did indeed seem to have a funding advantage.\n\nTo deal with this, Dodd-Frank created Ordinary Liquidation Authority, otherwise known as resolution authority \u2014 giving the government the legal authority to seize institutions the way it arguably should have in 2008-2009.\n\nBut Republican leaders fiercely opposed financial reform \u2014 and claimed that resolution authority actually made too-big-to-fail worse, because it institutionalized bailouts. This always seemed implausible; bailouts will happen in crises, one way or another. And if financial reform was a giveaway to the banks, why did Wall Street, which used to look relatively favorably on Democrats, turn overwhelmingly Republican after reform passed?\n\nStill, you\u2019d like some evidence. And GAO has the goods. There was indeed a large-bank funding advantage during and for some time after the crisis, but it has now been diminished or gone away \u2014 maybe even slightly reversed. That is, financial markets are now acting as if they believe that future bailouts won\u2019t be as favorable to fat cats as the bailouts of 2008.\n\nThis news is part of broader evidence that Dodd-Frank has actually done considerable good, on fronts from consumer protection to bank capitalization. Of course it should have been stronger; and I don\u2019t expect it ever to look as good as Obamacare increasingly does. But claims that it was counterproductive now look like claims that black is white.
