LOUIS (AP) \u2014 The nation\u2019s Heartland is ridding itself of the scourge of homemade methamphetamine, with lab seizures down by nearly half in many high-meth states. Any celebration is muted: Meth use remains high, but people are increasingly turning to cheaper, imported Mexican meth rather than making their own.\n\nMeth lab busts and seizures are down 40 percent or more in states that traditionally lead the country in the undesirable category, narcotics experts told The Associated Press.\n\nEnforcement actions and stricter laws are partly responsible, but the meth now coming through Mexican cartel pipelines is so cheap and pure that it is supplanting meth made in homes or soda bottles inside cars. The cartels have even expanded their meth reach to rural areas and small towns.\n\n\u201cThe great news is that meth from Mexico doesn\u2019t explode, doesn\u2019t burn down your house and your neighbor\u2019s home, doesn\u2019t contaminate your property, doesn\u2019t kill children the way meth labs have done here in the U.S. for decades,\u201d said Jason Grellner, the chief narcotics officer in Franklin County, Missouri.\n\nMeth lab seizures peaked nationally in 2004, when nearly 24,000 labs were seized. The Drug Enforcement Administration reported 11,573 seizures last year (the most recent available), up 363 from 2012.\n\nGrellner\u2019s county has often topped 100 meth lab seizures in a year, but have only had about a dozen this year. Statistics provided by the Missouri State Highway Patrol show 558 meth lab seizures occurred statewide for the first six months of 2014, putting Missouri on pace for 1,116. That would be a 34 percent drop from the 1,496 meth lab seizures in 2013, and only a little over half in 2012.\n\nThe decline is more pronounced in other high-meth states.\n\nIn Tennessee, lab seizures are down 40 percent this year, said Tommy Farmer, director of the Tennessee Meth and Pharmaceutical Task Force. Oklahoma had 160 meth lab seizures through September and is on pace for 213 \u2014 about half last year\u2019s seizure total, Oklahoma Bureau of Narcotics spokesman Mark Woodward said.\n\nOne only needs to go to the morgue to know that, despite fewer lab busts, the meth problem isn\u2019t going away.\n\nIn Oklahoma, which tracks meth-related deaths, 167 died of meth overdoses last year \u2014 up from 140 in 2012 and 108 in 2011, Woodward said. Figures for 2014 weren\u2019t available. \u201cI don\u2019t think meth use has ever been higher in the state of Oklahoma,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Mexican cartels have long controlled the market for illegal drugs such as cocaine and heroin. Meth was trickier. For years, many U.S. users have chosen to make their own, first in homemade labs that often caught fire or ruined houses. The Drug Enforcement Administration\u2019s website lists thousands of homes contaminated by meth.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Mexican meth increasingly supplanting at-home labs", "title": "Mexican meth increasingly supplanting at-home labs", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Mexican meth increasingly supplanting at-home labs", "title": "Mexican meth increasingly supplanting at-home labs", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/11/08/mexican_meth_increasingly_supplanting_at_home_labs/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/11/meth-labs-decline.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Mexican meth increasingly supplanting at-home labs", "title": "Mexican meth increasingly supplanting at-home labs", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/11/meth-labs-decline.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Jim Salter", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe07fd\"", "article_summary": "Any celebration is muted: Meth use remains high, but people are increasingly turning to cheaper, imported Mexican meth rather than making their own.\nGrellner\u2019s county has often topped 100 meth lab seizures in a year, but have only had about a dozen this year.\nMeth lab seizures peaked nationally in 2004, when nearly 24,000 labs were seized.\nStatistics provided by the Missouri State Highway Patrol show 558 meth lab seizures occurred statewide for the first six months of 2014, putting Missouri on pace for 1,116.\nThat would be a 34 percent drop from the 1,496 meth lab seizures in 2013, and only a little over half in 2012."}
