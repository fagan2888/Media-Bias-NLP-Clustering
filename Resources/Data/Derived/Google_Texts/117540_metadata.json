He says some of his most frequent visitors were Violet Township Paramedics.\n\nWolford has health issues that affect his ability to walk.\n\nHe says he is required to wear leg braces, but says the last time he was discharged from the hospital he was having trouble with failing straps on his braces, and chaffing that wasn\u2019t allowing his injury to heal properly.\n\nViolent Township Fire\u2019s new community paramedic helped Wolford find the resources to repair his braces which enabled the patient to take part in physical therapy.\n\nNow, instead of repeated falls, Wolford is slowly getting back on his feet.\n\n\"What we're really doing is navigating them through the health system,\u201d Violent Township Fire Lt. J.D. Postage said. \"It's just the little things sometimes that make the huge difference.\u201d\n\nCommunity paramedics make house calls to patients after they are discharged from the hospital.\n\nParamedics help patients with everything from filling prescriptions to applying for home health care to securing rides to doctor\u2019s appointments.\n\nThe Affordable Health Care Act fines hospitals if patients are re-admitted within 30 days of discharge.\n\nMount Carmel Health Systems says it\u2019s developing the community paramedic pilot program to make sure patients get well and stay well.\n\n\"The goal is to help people find their best health so they don't have to spend as much time in the hospital. We want to close the revolving door,\u201d Mount Carmel\u2019s Director of Community Outreach Brian Pierson said.\n\nViolet Township Fire Chief Mike Little says that not only makes health care more affordable for everyone, but says fewer calls to 911 frees up firefighters for other emergencies.\n\n\"These are the patients that may be calling us two, three, four times a week,\u201d Chief Little said.\n\nThe community paramedic concept is new in Central Ohio, but Wolford says the improvements to his health are proof the pilot program is making a difference.", "article_metadata": {"description": "It's a new approach to patient care and it could make health care more affordable for all of us.", "og": {"site_name": "WBNS-10TV Columbus, Ohio", "description": "It's a new approach to patient care and it could make health care more affordable for all of us.", "title": "Paramedic Program Helps Get Patients On The Road To Better Health", "url": "http://www.10tv.com/content/stories/2016/02/19/paramedic-program-helps-get-patients-on-the-road-to-better-health.html", "image": "http://www.10tv.com/content/videos/2016/02/19/paramedic-program.jpg", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 100480996669326}, "dfp-id": 8919, "dfp-adunit": "10TV_ROS/10TV_News", "google-site-verification": "oAfV5ExqDpMG7IN3s-onYSMOZYzGcQsWBAOUMvXCw_c", "dfp-targeting": "{\"cat\":\"news\"}"}, "article_summary": "Mount Carmel Health Systems says it\u2019s developing the community paramedic pilot program to make sure patients get well and stay well.\nIt's a new approach to patient care and it could make health care more affordable for all of us.\nParamedics help patients with everything from filling prescriptions to applying for home health care to securing rides to doctor\u2019s appointments.\nThe community paramedic concept is new in Central Ohio, but Wolford says the improvements to his health are proof the pilot program is making a difference.\nThe Affordable Health Care Act fines hospitals if patients are re-admitted within 30 days of discharge."}
