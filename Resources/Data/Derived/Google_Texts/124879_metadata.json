Ron Wyden (OR), the top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee.\n\nEarlier this year he, along with several other Senate lawmakers, introduced legislation that would impose penalties on the Pentagon if it fails meet a legally mandated goal of being fully auditable by September 2017.\n\nRelated: The Pentagon's $766 Million Afghan 'Slush Fund' Comes Under Scrutiny\n\nThe filling station \u201cappears to be exactly the type of unacceptable boondoggle that our legislation aims to prevent,\u201d he said Monday in a letter to Defense Secretary Ash Carter.\n\n\u201cWith this in mind, please provide my office, in writing, an update on DOD\u2019s auditability efforts, including the best current estimate of when the department will be audit-ready,\u201d Wyden added.\n\nStarting in 1997, the Government Accountability Office has been required to audit the federal government\u2019s consolidated financial statements but the watchdog agency has repeatedly said its reviews of the Pentagon are not based on accurate data. This is a particularly troubling claim since the department accounts for over half of U.S. discretionary spending.\n\nRelated: The Fight Against ISIS Has New Price Tag: $5 Billion and Counting\n\nIn a slow-moving effort to lower expectations, Pentagon officials have hinted to congressional lawmakers several times, in Capitol Hill hearings or elsewhere, that the agency might not be able to meet the 2017 goal.\n\nThe audit bill, originally introduced by Wyden, Sen. Joe Manchin (D-WV) and GOP presidential rivals Rand Paul (KY) and Ted Cruz (TX), calls for increased oversight every year the department fails to meet the 2017 target. It would eventually strip the Pentagon\u2019s ability to transfer funds between its accounts, a process dubbed \u201creprogramming.\u201d\n\nThe legislation, which is also backed by Democratic White House hopeful Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and Senate Budget Committee chair Mike Enzi (R-WY), would reward the Pentagon if it met the fiscal goal, including granting it greater ability to reprogram funds.\n\nBut after the SIGAR report, it\u2019s clear the Pentagon faces a deeply skeptical audience.\n\nIn his letter, Wyden said the watchdog\u2019s \u201cmost disturbing findings \u2026 concern the DOD\u2019s behavior,\u201d noting the department\u2019s \u201cbaffling\u201d claim that no one at the agency has any knowledge of the task force, even though it was dissolved less than a year ago.\n\n\u201cMore disturbing still, the SIGAR clearly stated that its review \u2018was hindered by DOD\u2019s lack of cooperation\u2019 and paints a picture of a department restricting access and failing to deliver on commitments,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cSeveral of my colleagues have already publicly committed to plumbing this report and its disturbing conclusions. I will wholeheartedly assist them in those efforts,\u201d said Wyden.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "A senior Democrat senator pressing for an update on legally-mandated audit of the Defense Department\u2019s financial records after a recent federal watchdog study found the U.S. spent almost $43 million building a natural gas station in Afghanistan.", "title": "The $43 Million Gas Station: Why We Need to Audit the Pentagon", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/11/17/43-Million-Gas-Station-Why-We-Need-Audit-Pentagon", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/03142013_pentagon_money_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/11/17/43-Million-Gas-Station-Why-We-Need-Audit-Pentagon", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/03142013_pentagon_money_article.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "A senior Democrat senator pressing for an update on legally-mandated audit of the Defense Department\u2019s financial records after a recent federal watchdog study found the U.S. spent almost $43 million building a natural gas station in Afghanistan.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "But after the SIGAR report, it\u2019s clear the Pentagon faces a deeply skeptical audience.\nA senior Democrat senator is pressing for an update on the legally-mandated audit of the Defense Department\u2019s financial records after a recent federal watchdog study found the U.S. spent almost $43 million building a natural gas station in Afghanistan.\nA report by the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR) found the department awarded a roughly $3 million contract to Central Asian Engineering to construct the gas station but the final price tag wound up being $42.7 million, with $12.3 million spent on direct costs and $20 million in overhead.\nThe discovery still has many Capitol Hill lawmakers seeing red, including Sen.
