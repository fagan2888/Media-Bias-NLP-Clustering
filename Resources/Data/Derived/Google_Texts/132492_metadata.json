Pebble Beach is known for its great weather, breathtaking views and sandy beaches. It is located on the Monterey Peninsula in Monterey County, Calif.\n\nThere were a number of great stories at this year\u2019s AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am. Vaughn Taylor, who lost his game over the years, rallied on Sunday to win for the first time in a decade. With his win, the one-time Ryder Cup player punched his ticket to the Masters.\n\nEarlier in the week during a practice round, Jordan Spieth, the No. 1 golfer in the world had a great moment with his caddie Michael Greller.\n\nGreller, stepped to the tee box on the stunning par-3 seventh hole, and hit a full on shank. Spieth\u2019s reaction to the shot is priceless: Afer Greller\u2019s chili pepper, you can hear Spieth and the rest of the group laughing as Greller walks back to the bag.\n\nCheck out the full video below.\n\n\n\nWhat\u2019s worse than a shank at Pebble?\u2026 A shank with World No. 1 @JordanSpieth watching. Sorry, @Michael_Greller.https://t.co/ZeKKf65P9R \u2014 Under Armour Golf (@UAGolf) February 11, 2016\n\nJustin Timberlake also joined the party while playing at Spyglass Hill, the second course used during the AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am.\n\nTimberlake, playing alongside tour pro Justin Rose took a moment to serenade a small group of fans after the music star spotted a fan carrying a guitar.\n\nTimberlake also did \u201cThe Carlton\u201d dance from The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air with the the man who made if famous, Alfonso Ribeiro.\n\nSpieth had another great moment Sunday on the practice putting green after his putter was taken away from him. While waiting to tee off, Dustin Johnson\u2019s son, Tatum, for a moment stole Spieth\u2019s putter.\n\nThe moment was captured by Janet Gretzky, the mother of Johnson\u2019s fiancee, Paulina Gretzky. Below is the video she posed on Instagram.\n\nA video posted by @janetgretzky on Feb 13, 2016 at 6:26pm PST\n\nFan favorite Bill Murray was not hard to spot on Saturday at Pebble, as the lifelong Chicago Cubs fan was spotted wearing some amazing Cubs pants.
