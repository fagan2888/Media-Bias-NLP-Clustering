The topic of the discussion was big data in healthcare.\n\nPanelists, including former national health IT coordinator Dr. Farzad Mostashari, Dr. Bob Kocher of investment firm Venrock and athenahealth Executive Vice President and COO Ed Park, mostly concurred with Connolly, who moderated the talk.\n\nPark said that there is too much data and too little ability to act on it now. Mostashari then noted that insights gained from analytics are creating new tasks for healthcare professionals, and not all of the tasks fit into current workflow. \u201cIt\u2019s impossible if you\u2019re trying to operate in the old business model,\u201d the former national coordinator said.\n\nPark said that the traditional \u201cthree Vs\u201d of big data, namely volume, variability and velocity, still apply, particularly the latter. \u201cI\u2019m real excited about the velocity of data,\u201d he said, because velocity of data movement is accelerating. For example, Park said, data from an emergency department is \u201cnot helpful if the person entered the ED two months ago,\u201d\n\nMostashari also picked up on the ED example, saying that the most accessible potential of big data in healthcare today is in admission-discharge-transfer notifications. Say a patient of a primary care physician showed up in a hospital ED an hour ago. \u201cYou know that. What are you going to do about it?\u201d he asked.\n\nMostashari said that 91 percent of clients of Aledade , the startup company he launched to support physician-led Accountable Care Organizations, receive event notifications. The challenge for these practices now is to develop protocols for responding to such notifications.\n\nAgain, though, the financial incentives have to be right. \u201cThe more you move to caring for total populations, the more there is a business case for that,\u201d Mostashari said.\n\nAs a physician, Kocher said he just wants to know how patients are feeling, whether they are in for an office visit the office or in their daily lives. \u201cI\u2019m excited about patient-reported outcomes,\u201d he said.\n\nIf practitioners are paid for managing populations, it makes sense to seek and act on data from outside traditional care settings. \u201cOne of the first places we could begin building that is in behavioral health,\u201d he offered.", "article_metadata": {"description": "There's a growing sense of angst and frustration in the \"data liberaci\u00f3n\" movement these days, and much of it has do with the difficulty of fighting the status quo in healthcare.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "MedCity News", "description": "There's a growing sense of angst and frustration in the \"data liberaci\u00f3n\" movement these days, and much of it has do with the difficulty of fighting the status quo in healthcare.", "title": "Health Datapalooza: Fee-for-service hampers big data", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://medcitynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/20150601_095807.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-06-02T05:38:33-04:00", "url": "http://medcitynews.com/2015/06/health-datapalooza-fee-for-service-hampers-big-data/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://medcitynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/20150601_095807.jpg", "creator": "@nversel", "description": "There's a growing sense of angst and frustration in the \"data liberaci\u00f3n\" movement these days, and much of it has do with the difficulty of fighting the status quo in healthcare.", "card": "summary", "title": "Health Datapalooza: Fee-for-service hampers big data"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 148725768475669}, "google-site-verification": "xudQg7nxVR9ifmMTY4Tf-0wVtX9b6rWLQd0utCweGOc", "keywords": "weight loss, obesity, overweight,diabetes,massachusetts,medical devices,obesity,startups,healthcare innovation, medcity news,medcity news,san francisco, startups, life sciences,accelerator,rock health,startup advice,startup funding,patient monitoring system, motion sensors ,dc,healthcare it,washington,foodborne pathogens, diagnostics company, diagnostic platforms,minimally invasive surgery, laser surgery,cambridge,dealflow,hospitals,wellpoint, healthways, health and wellness, employee wellness programs,investing,wellness,medtronic, shanghai innovation center, china, r&d,china,mdt,minneapolis,minnesota,publics,twin cities,ulcerative colitis, abbott labs, humira,abbott labs,doctors,pharmaceuticals,skin disorders, pharmaceuticals, md anderson cancer center,cancer,texas,renal denervation, st. jude medical,st. jude medical,stj,emr, ehr, electronic health records, electronic medical records, certified emr,certified emr,ehr,electronic health records,electronic medical records,advanced cellular technology,amyotrophic lateral sclerosis,embryonic stem cells,geron corporation,lou gehrig\\'s disease,macular degeneration,regenerative medicine,spinal cord damage,value-based healthcare system, obamacare, fee-for-service model,california,cleveland,health insurance,insurance,ohio,pennsylvania,politics,cancer treatment options library, aetna, aet, healthcare it,aet,aetna,health it,phi,philadelphia,Athenahealth, Big Data, Ceci Connolly, Ed Park, Farzad Mostashari, hdpalooza15, Health Datapalooza, healthcare reform, Population Health, pricewaterhousecoopers, Robert Kocher, Venrock, Washington D.C., , MedCity News", "article": {"section": "Daily", "tag": "Washington D.C.", "published_time": "2015-06-01T13:23:20-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-02T05:38:33-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,width=device-width,user-scalable=no,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdefb4\"", "article_summary": "The topic of the discussion was big data in healthcare.\nPark said that the traditional \u201cthree Vs\u201d of big data, namely volume, variability and velocity, still apply, particularly the latter.\nIf practitioners are paid for managing populations, it makes sense to seek and act on data from outside traditional care settings.\n\u201cI\u2019m real excited about the velocity of data,\u201d he said, because velocity of data movement is accelerating.\n\u201cThere won\u2019t be major change until payment shifts\u201d away from fee-for-service to rewarding value and outcomes, Ceci Connolly, managing director of PricewaterhouseCoopers\u2019 Health Research Institute , said Monday during the opening session of Health Datapalooza in Washington."}
