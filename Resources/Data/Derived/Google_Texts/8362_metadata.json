The new model offers motivation for hospitals and healthcare systems to become larger and have better access to resources.\n\n\"All that this will mean is higher quality care at a lower cost because of scale,\" Faas said. \"It's going to mean more locations and a better focus on prevention and wellness and it's going to put real choice in the market.\n\n\"That's our goal.\"\n\nFaas said Metro administrators and CHS will have an equal representation for decisions that affect West Michigan.\n\nLast year was Metro's most successful in terms of growing its footprint, Faas said, employing more medical professionals and building the amount of cash on hand at about $120 million. A partnership with CHS rids Metro of $160 million of debt with \"no financial handcuffs once we do the deal,\" Faas said.\n\nThe partnership positions Metro to compete with Spectrum Health and Mercy Health St. Marys, and gives it more ability in the marketplace to grow. CHS is a for-profit organization with 135 affiliated hospitals nationwide, including the renowned Cleveland Clinic.\n\n\"We're working with CHS as an equity owner that can help us resolved ... (much) of the major issues currently facing Metro ... standing between us and where healthcare needs to go,\" Faas said.\n\nAndrew Krietz covers breaking and general police/fire news for MLive | The Grand Rapids Press.
