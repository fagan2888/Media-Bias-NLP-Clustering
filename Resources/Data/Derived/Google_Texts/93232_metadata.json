This new development probably will continue to set the retailer apart from its peers, however. Some companies are cutting hours and full-time positions completely in order to get under the threshold for the mandatory offering of health benefits outlined in President Obama\u2019s health-care overhaul, formally known as the Affordable Care Act, or ACA.\n\nTrader Joe\u2019s had determined that government subsidies, which would have been available anyway to lower-income workers, made it impractical to continue paying for coverage itself. The Post said it obtained a confidential memo from Trader Joe\u2019s Chief Executive Dan Bane to employees outlining the plan.\n\n\u201cDepending on income you may earn outside of Trader Joe\u2019s, we believe that with the $500 from Trader Joe\u2019s and the tax credits available under the ACA, many of you should be able to obtain health care coverage at very little if any net cost to you,\u201d Bane wrote in the memo to workers.\n\nFollow Russ Britt on Twitter @russbrittmktw\n\nFollow Health Exchange on Twitter @MWHealthBlog", "article_metadata": {"article.created": "2013-09-12T14:38:35-04:00", "application-name": "MarketWatch.com", "twitter": {"domain": "Marketwatch.com", "description": "Add specialty retailer Trader Joe's to the list of employers who will cut health-care benefits to its part-time workers -- but it's not untethering those workers completely from coverage.", "title": "Trader Joe\u2019s takes away health plans, but offers stipend: report", "url": "http://blogs.marketwatch.com/health-exchange/2013/09/12/trader-joes-takes-away-health-plans-but-offers-stipend-report/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/MWimages/MW-DR328_mw_soc_NS_20150801233302.png"}, "site": "MarketWatch", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.author": "Russ Britt", "article.section": "Markets", "keywords": "benefit cuts,Obamacare,Trader Joe's", "article.headline": "Trader Joe\u2019s takes away health plans, but offers stipend: report", "msapplication-task": "name=SmartMoney;action-uri=http://www.smartmoney.com/;icon-uri=http://www.smartmoney.com/favicon.ico", "news_keywords": "benefit cuts,Obamacare,Trader Joe's", "author": "Russ Britt", "article.page": "Health Exchange Blog", "description": "Add specialty retailer Trader Joe's to the list of employers who will cut health-care benefits to its part-time workers -- but it's not untethering those workers completely from coverage.", "article.published": "2013-09-12T14:38:35-04:00", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "msapplication-tooltip": "MarketWatch", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.marketwatch.com/health-exchange/2013/09/12/trader-joes-takes-away-health-plans-but-offers-stipend-report/", "app_id": 283204329838}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/marketwatch", "image_count": 2}, "og": {"site_name": "Marketwatch", "description": "Add specialty retailer Trader Joe's to the list of employers who will cut health-care benefits to its part-time workers -- but it's not untethering those workers completely from coverage.", "title": "Trader Joe\u2019s takes away health plans, but offers stipend: report", "url": "http://blogs.marketwatch.com/health-exchange/2013/09/12/trader-joes-takes-away-health-plans-but-offers-stipend-report/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/MWimages/MW-DR328_mw_soc_NS_20150801233302.png", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Health Exchange", "article.id": "BL-MW243B-1130", "article.updated": "2013-09-12T14:38:35-04:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0c80\"", "article_summary": "The Post said it obtained a confidential memo from Trader Joe\u2019s Chief Executive Dan Bane to employees outlining the plan.\nBloomberg NewsTrader Joe\u2019s had bucked the industry trend by offering low-cost health, dental and vision plans to its part-time workers.\nAdd specialty retailer Trader Joe\u2019s to the list of employers who will cut health-care benefits to its part-time workers \u2014 but it\u2019s not untethering those workers completely from coverage.\nTrader Joe\u2019s had determined that government subsidies, which would have been available anyway to lower-income workers, made it impractical to continue paying for coverage itself.\nFollow Russ Britt on Twitter @russbrittmktwFollow Health Exchange on Twitter @MWHealthBlog"}
