And talk. And talk. But all that talking means they may sometimes fail to listen to teammates, and miss key information. Or, they may fail to listen to what a customer really wants and lose a sale.\n\nYoung extroverts need to be more aware of how their outgoing ways can be perceived by more introverted and experienced workers.\n\nDan Schawbel, author of \u201cPromote Yourself: The New Rules for Career Success,\u201d says that millennial extroverts need to be conscious of how introverts operate.\n\n\u201cInstead of being overly aggressive with an introvert, allow them to talk first and support what they have to say. This will make them more inclined to want to work with you,\u201d he says.\n\nWrite to Anita Bruzzese in care of USA TODAY/Gannett, 7950 Jones Branch Drive, McLean, VA 22108.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Anita Bruzzese", "description": "Ask an introvert about an extroverted colleague and you're likely to hear how these outgoing co-workers talk too much, have trouble staying on task and ...", "pubdate": "2013-09-14 19:50:40", "author": "Anita Bruzzese", "og": {"site_name": "TribLIVE.com", "description": "Ask an introvert about an extroverted colleague and you're likely to hear how these outgoing co-workers talk too much, have trouble staying on task and ...", "title": "Introverts battle many career obstacles", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://triblive.com/csp/mediapool/sites/TribLIVE/assets2/img/logos/triblive/TribLIVELogo.jpg", "updated_time": "2013-09-15 14:11:10.445", "url": "http://triblive.com/business/headlines/4695336-74/extroverts-says-introvert", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"description": "Ask an introvert about an extroverted colleague and you're likely to hear how these outgoing co-workers talk too much, have trouble staying on task and ...", "title": "Introverts battle many career obstacles", "app": {"url": {"ipad": "tribbird://", "iphone": "tribbird://"}, "name": {"ipad": "TribLIVE News and Sports", "iphone": "TribLIVE News and Sports"}, "id": {"ipad": 328217517, "iphone": 328217517}}, "creator": "@triblive", "site": {"identifier": "@triblive", "id": 20269833}, "image": "http://triblive.com/csp/mediapool/sites/TribLIVE/assets2/img/logos/triblive/TribLIVETwitter.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.date": "2013-09-14 19:50:40", "sailthru.canonical": "http://triblive.com/business/headlines/4695336-74/extroverts-says-introvert", "sailthru.title": "Introverts battle many career obstacles", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=328217517", "fb": {"app_id": 144410955752326}, "sailthru.tags": "Newsletter, News, Wire Stories", "headline": "Introverts battle many career obstacles", "keywords": "extroverts, says, introverts, introvert, talk", "article": {"category": "Business", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/triblive", "published_time": "2013-09-14 19:50:40", "subcategory": "Headlines", "mainsection": "News", "section": "News", "publishedtoweb": "2013-09-14 19:50:40", "modified_time": "2013-09-15 14:11:10.445", "tag": "extroverts, says, introverts, introvert, talk", "subsection": "Headlines", "title": "Introverts battle many career obstacles", "author": "Anita Bruzzese"}, "docauthor": "Anita Bruzzese", "sailthru.description": "Ask an introvert about an extroverted colleague and you're likely to hear how these outgoing co-workers talk too much, have trouble staying on task and ..."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd5a7e\"", "article_summary": "Introverts battle many career obstaclesEmail Newsletters Sign up for one of our email newsletters.\nDan Schawbel, author of \u201cPromote Yourself: The New Rules for Career Success,\u201d says that millennial extroverts need to be conscious of how introverts operate.\nWhile there is much discussion about how introverts can get ahead and work and overcome some issues that may cause them to be overlooked in favor of the more outgoing extroverts, Dembling says there are plenty of career issues facing extroverts.\n\u201cI think one of the things I learned that really surprised me was that extroverts say when they don't have enough interaction, they feel sad,\u201d she says.\n\u201cInstead of being overly aggressive with an introvert, allow them to talk first and support what they have to say."}
