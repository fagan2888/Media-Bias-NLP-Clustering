Tom Wolf\u2019s got his first report card, so to speak.\n\nA new Franklin & Marshall College poll out Thursday finds nearly two in five Pennsylvania voters (38 percent) consider the governor\u2019s job performance to be \u201cexcellent\u201d or \u201cgood.\u201d\n\nThe results split along party lines as expected, with 58 percent of Democrats saying Wolf is doing an \u201cexcellent/good\u201d job and 61 percent of Republicans saying he is performing \u201conly fair/poor.\u201d\n\nWhen ranked with his predecessors, Wolf fairs better than recently-ousted Republican Gov. Tom Corbett, who hovered at just 30 percent \u201cexcellent/good\u201d job performance at the beginning of his term. But stacked against popular former Governors Ed Rendell and Tom Ridge, Wolf falters a bit \u2014 Rendell and Ridge began their terms with just below and just above 50 percent of voters, respectively, considering their job performance \u201cexcellent/good.\u201d\n\nWolf\u2019s approval rating remained stagnate at 40 percent, the same as the college\u2019s October 2014 survey. There was a slight uptick in the number of Pennsylvania voters undecided about Wolf, rising from 18 to 22 percent since the last poll.\n\nThe best news for Wolf, however, lies in the number of Pennsylvanians who believe the state is headed in the right direction. Though more Pennsylvanians (47 percent) responded that the state was off on the wrong track, the 39 percent who do believe the state is moving forward is the highest percentage since the college\u2019s February 2010 survey.\n\nJust last October, only 28 percent of Pennsylvanians were positive about the state\u2019s future, while a solid majority (61 percent) were pessimistic.\n\nAnother win for Wolf? His budget plan is much better liked by the people of Pennsylvania than the Republicans in the legislature. A majority (59 percent) support the plan proposed in Wolf\u2019s first budget address.\n\nThe Franklin & Marshall poll surveyed 597 Pennsylvania voters from March 17 to 23 and has a margin of error of +/- 4.2 percent.\n\nMarch 26th, 2015 | Posted in Front Page Stories, Governor, Poll, Top Stories | 11 Comments", "article_metadata": {"description": "The newly-elected Governor has the support of the people so far.", "generator": "WordPress 4.1.11", "og": {"url": "http://www.politicspa.com/fm-poll-wolf-receives-good-numbers-in-first-survey-of-his-tenure/64779/", "image": "http://www.politicspa.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Governor-Wolf7-300x221.png", "type": "article", "description": "The newly-elected Governor has the support of the people so far.", "title": "F&M Poll: Wolf Receives Good Numbers in First Survey of His Tenure"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 775768999125308}, "keywords": "f&m poll,governor,tom wolf,approval,pa-gov,f&m poll", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbcd0\"", "article_summary": "F&M Poll: Wolf Receives Good Numbers in First Survey of His TenureWritten by Abby Smith, Contributing WriterNewly-elected Gov.\nThe Franklin & Marshall poll surveyed 597 Pennsylvania voters from March 17 to 23 and has a margin of error of +/- 4.2 percent.\nTom Wolf\u2019s got his first report card, so to speak.\nThere was a slight uptick in the number of Pennsylvania voters undecided about Wolf, rising from 18 to 22 percent since the last poll.\nTom Corbett, who hovered at just 30 percent \u201cexcellent/good\u201d job performance at the beginning of his term."}
