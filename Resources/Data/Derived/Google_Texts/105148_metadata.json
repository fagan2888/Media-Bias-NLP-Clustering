They want to restore the 40-hour definition.\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office said that going back to the 40-hour rule would cost the government about $53 billion over the next decade and kick 1 million people off insurance they now have through their employers. An estimated 500,000 to 1 million people would seek government-subsidized coverage through Medicaid or Obamacare\u2019s health care exchanges.\n\nUndeterred, House Republican leaders urged support of the bill. They cited a study that says Americans making less than $30,000 per year were most likely to have their hours cut because of the mandate, which imposes fines on employers that do not offer insurance.\n\nThe Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee will hold its first hearing of the year on the issue, too.\n\nSen. Susan M. Collins, Maine Republican, said Mr. Obama\u2019s veto vow seemed to break his pledge to work on needed fixes for the law.\n\n\u201cHe initially said, \u2018Bring me your ideas,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cWhy he\u2019s shutting it down is beyond me.\u201d\n\nSen. Joe Donnelly, Indiana Democrat, said the 30-hour threshold is forcing restaurants, school districts and other employers to cut workers\u2019 hours to 29 or less to avoid the mandate, so it should be reset at the traditional 40 hours.\n\n\u201cWe need to make this change as fast as we can,\u201d said Mr. Donnelly, who stressed that he does not want to repeal Obamacare.\n\nHe joined Ms. Collins, Sen. Lisa Murkowski, Alaska Republican, and Sen. Joe Manchin III, West Virginia Democrat, as the chief sponsors of the legislation in the Senate.\n\nThe White House argues that the bill would create the problem it intends to solve by exposing an even greater number of people \u2014 those who work 40 hours per week \u2014 to pared-down hours among employers that try to duck the mandate.\n\nMs. Collins slammed those warnings as \u201cbogus.\u201d\n\nThe budget scoring reflects the number of employers who will refuse to insure their workers and pay a penalty, which she interpreted as an inherent sign that the mandate will not work as planned.\n\nShe said employers are committed to offering insurance to workers who put in a standard 40 hours, and that would not change.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Congressional lawmakers, including Democrats, rebuked the White House on Wednesday for refusing to allow tweaks to Obamacare, saying President Obama is reneging on his promise to work to fix problems in the law.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Congressional lawmakers, including Democrats, rebuked the White House on Wednesday for refusing to allow tweaks to Obamacare, saying President Obama is reneging on his promise to work to fix problems in the law.", "title": "Senators slam White House threat to veto $53B Obamacare hours fix", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jan/7/senators-slam-wh-threat-veto-53b-obamacare-fix/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/01/07/ap248607598047.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/01/07/ap248607598047.jpg", "description": "Congressional lawmakers, including Democrats, rebuked the White House on Wednesday for refusing to allow tweaks to Obamacare, saying President Obama is reneging on his promise to work to fix problems", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Senators slam White House threat to veto $53B Obamacare hours fix"}, "Author": "Tom Howell Jr.", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Labor, Social Issues, Politics, Senate, White House"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0997\"", "article_summary": "The House has a vote slated for Thursday, and Senate Republican leaders said they can\u2019t imagine giving up even after Mr. Obama\u2019s veto promise.\nUndeterred, House Republican leaders urged support of the bill.\nCongressional lawmakers, including Democrats, rebuked the White House on Wednesday for refusing to allow tweaks to Obamacare, saying President Obama is reneging on his promise to work to fix problems in the law.\nCritics say that is pushing employers to cut some workers\u2019 hours to stay below the threshold for having to comply with the Obamacare business mandate.\nA day after the White House said it would veto a bill to re-establish the 40-hour workweek standard, House and Senate members said they would press ahead and dare the president to oppose them."}
