( Brandon Hopper / Daily Record )\n\nTigers junior Cody Simms delivers against Pueblo South on Saturday at Justin Field. The Colts won 7-0. (Brandon Hopper / Daily Record)\n\nJared Baros got ahead of the Tigers on Saturday, and the Colts stayed there.\n\nThe Pueblo South junior placed three pitches consistently, and kept Ca\u00f1on City off-balance in a 7-0 Colts win in a South-Central League game at Justin Field.\n\nIn his complete-game performance, Baros allowed just two hits.\n\n\"We're working backwards, we're feeding into the pitcher, what he's trying to do,\" Tigers coach Tim Ritter said. \"We're going out there fishing for curveballs, then we let fastballs go by and we get behind in the count and so you're swinging at his pitches.\"\n\nBaros said his slider was his best pitch Saturday, and he was successful because he kept the ball down in the zone and had good command. He said earlier this season he'd struggled to find his rhythm and control.\n\n\"Today was a good example of what he can do,\" Colts coach J.R. Crowell said. \"He was nice and fluid, nice a loose. The run early helped settle him down.\"\n\nPueblo South scored a run in the second inning thanks to a lead-off triple by Cory Voss. Baros helped his own cause two batters later with a sacrifice fly to plate Voss.\n\nThe Tigers almost struck early against Baros. In the first inning, Neiko Paolino drew a walk and Logan Nethercot followed him with a single. Cameron Brosh moved the runners up a spot with a sacrifice bunt, but the threat didn't lead to any runs.\n\n\"That's the first time I'd seen him \u2014 a lot of these guys had faced him before,\" Nethercot said. \"He was good, he got ahead of us, and when you get ahead of somebody, you can throw what you want.\"\n\nBack-to-back errors in the second by Colts third baseman Brandon Maes put more runners in scoring position, but Baros fielded a sacrifice bunt attempt and fired to third to force out Dante Teigen, and later picked off a runner at second base.\n\nOn Deck Tuesday: Ca\u00f1on City @ Pueblo West, 4 p.m.* Thursday: Ca\u00f1on City vs. Pueblo East, 4 p.m.* April 12: Ca\u00f1on City @ Pueblo Central, 10 a.m.* * South-Central League game\n\nThe game was close for most of the way. Jared Mews' single in the fifth, followed by a wild pitch to put runners at second and third, meant the tying run was on second base. After an intentional walk to Nethercot to load the bases, cleanup hitter Brosh made a solid contact, but Mike Ramirez fielded the ball and forced out Nethercot at second.\n\nCody Simms was the starting pitcher for the Tigers and worked three-plus innings, giving up two hits, four walks and getting one batter to strike out. He was followed by Trey Owen, Jarett Koch and Nethercot on the mound as the team searched for someone to get ahead in counts and limit damage. The first three pitchers walked a total of six batters.\n\n\"First pitch strikes for us was 27 percent,\" Ritter said. \"We're getting behind in the count and having to come in on fastballs. You can get away with that for a little bit, but if you keep doing that in a game, you're going to get beat and that was the difference.\"\n\nThe Colts finally broke open a big inning in the seventh when they put up four runs on four hits.\n\nVoss had a three-hit game and scored three times.\n\nFor the Tigers, Nethercot was 1 for 1 and walked twice (once intentionally).\n\nThe Tigers are now 5-2 overall but 0-2 in league. Pueblo South improved to 4-5 and 1-2.\n\nCa\u00f1on City's next game will be at 4 p.m. Tuesday against the Pueblo West Cyclones (3-3-1, 1-0).", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.canoncitydailyrecord.com/canoncity-sports/ci_25502935/pueblo-south-colts-jared-baros-throws-2-hitter", "modificationDate": "2014-04-05T14:18:14-0600", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site49/2014/0405/20140405__06drcbaw~1_300.jpg", "sailthru.author": "By Brandon Hopper \n \n  hopperb@canoncitydailyrecord.com", "description": "Pueblo South junior Jared Baros placed three pitches consistently, and kept Ca\u00f1on City off-balance in a 7-0 Colts win in a South-Central League game at Justin Field.", "ag": {"canon": "CanonCityDailyRecord:article:25502935:view"}, "startDate": "2014-04-05T14:17:32-0600", "og": {"url": "http://www.canoncitydailyrecord.com/canoncity-sports/ci_25502935/pueblo-south-colts-jared-baros-throws-2-hitter", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site49/2014/0405/20140405__06drcbaw~2.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Pueblo South junior Jared Baros placed three pitches consistently, and kept Ca\u00f1on City off-balance in a 7-0 Colts win in a South-Central League game at Justin Field.", "title": "Pueblo South Colts' Jared Baros throws 2-hitter to beat Ca\u00f1on City Tigers"}, "twitter": {"domain": "canoncitydailyrecord.com", "description": "Pueblo South junior Jared Baros placed three pitches consistently, and kept Ca\u00f1on City off-balance in a 7-0 Colts win in a South-Central League game at Justin Field.", "title": "Pueblo South Colts' Jared Baros throws 2-hitter to beat Ca\u00f1on City Tigers", "url": "http://www.canoncitydailyrecord.com/canoncity-sports/ci_25502935/pueblo-south-colts-jared-baros-throws-2-hitter", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site49/2014/0405/20140405__06drcbaw~2.jpg", "site": "@CCDR_news", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-04-05T14:17:32-0600", "sailthru.site": "canoncitydailyrecord.com", "endDate": "2024-04-05T14:15:47-0600", "sailthru.title": "Pueblo South Colts' Jared Baros throws 2-hitter to beat Ca\u00f1on City Tigers", "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "sailthru.section": "Sports", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "google-site-verification": "oCjqPZ-ii-IZW-fBJ0mmX5dmH5aafePG3FLx_kSYFiA", "byline": "By Brandon Hopperhopperb@canoncitydailyrecord.com", "sailthru.image.full": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site49/2014/0405/20140405__06drcbaw~1.jpg", "pubDate": "2014-04-05T14:20:06-0600", "news_keywords": "Canyon City news, Colorado news, world news, national news, local news, business news, sports news, entertainment news, us news, Canyon City Daily Record"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe28e5\"", "article_summary": "( Brandon Hopper / Daily Record )Tigers junior Cody Simms delivers against Pueblo South on Saturday at Justin Field.\nThe Pueblo South junior placed three pitches consistently, and kept Ca\u00f1on City off-balance in a 7-0 Colts win in a South-Central League game at Justin Field.\nOn Deck Tuesday: Ca\u00f1on City @ Pueblo West, 4 p.m.* Thursday: Ca\u00f1on City vs. Pueblo East, 4 p.m.* April 12: Ca\u00f1on City @ Pueblo Central, 10 a.m.* * South-Central League gameThe game was close for most of the way.\nFor the Tigers, Nethercot was 1 for 1 and walked twice (once intentionally).\nPueblo South improved to 4-5 and 1-2."}
