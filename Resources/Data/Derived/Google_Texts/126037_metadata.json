Brian Andrews, a reporter from WFOR-TV in Miami, remarked that Salerno\u2019s computer screen was displaying some all-too-familiar text.\n\n\u201cThe screen says \u2018I\u2019m sorry but the system is temporarily down,\u2019\u201d Andrews said.\n\n\u201cUh-oh,\u201d Sebelius said, according to WFOR. (It should be noted that when the \u201cuh-oh\u201d response is heard on video, Sebelius\u2019 face is inadvertently blocked on camera, so the clip itself doesn\u2019t show her saying those words; she\u2019s reported to have said it, however, by WFOR.)\n\nUPDATE: The new video below from Fox News shows the latter exchange occurring from a different angle, and Sebelius is not depicted saying \u201cuh-oh,\u201d as WFOR previously reported. \u201cUh-oh\u201d is stated by someone else not depicted in the clip, according to the video.\n\n// ]]>\n\n\u201cThat happens every day,\u201d Salerno interjected, WFOR reported. \u201cIt must mean a lot of people are on there trying to get coverage.\u201d\n\nWilly Williams of Miami was also working with a navigator to get signed up online.\n\n\u201cIt went down three times,\u201d Williams told the station, noting he thought he was making progress, \u201cbut we\u2019re just going to keep trying.\u201d\n\nSebelius said the Obamacare website wasn\u2019t sufficiently tested before its disastrous Oct. 1 launch. According to WFOR, she added, \u201cHad I known then what I know now, things would have been different.\u201d\n\nSebelius also acknowledged widespread user frustration during a news conference.\n\n\u201cFor a number of them, they are frustrated with the web experience that they had but eager enough for the coverage that they\u2019re going to return over and over again,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat I know is that if that if you\u2019re not in that situation and you tried the website a couple of times, we\u2019re going to have to work extra hard to get you back.\u201d\n\nAndrews said Sebelius also revealed how many people in south Florida successfully signed up for Obamacare on Tuesday using the website: two.\n\nHere\u2019s the clip from WFOR:\n\nThis post has been updated to reflect that a Fox News video shows Kathleen Sebelius not saying \u201cuh-oh,\u201d as first reported by WFOR-TV. Those words are stated by someone else not depicted in the clip, according to the Fox News video.\n\n(H/T: Weasel Zippers)\n\n\u2013", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30; polling-uri=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/1.xml; polling-uri2=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/2.xml; polling-uri3=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/3.xml; polling-uri4=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/4.xml", "application-name": "TheBlaze.com", "twitter": {"description": "You'd think visiting friendly territory would provide embattled Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius a bit of a breather from the heat she's taken lately for the relentlessly failing Obamacare website.
