The federal government spent around $5 billion to set up the state marketplaces.\n\nRep. Tim Murphy, R-Pa., asked Slavitt whether it was appropriate for state exchanges to transfer to HealthCare.gov after spending hundreds of millions of dollars of taxpayer money.\n\n\u201cShouldn\u2019t there be other consequences for that? They\u2019ve failed but they\u2019ve spent all this money then later said \u2018gee sorry it didn\u2019t work out.\u2019 Does that seem appropriate?\u201d Murphy asked.\n\nSlavitt responded by saying that states have the right to change their minds and to move to the federal exchange, but if money had been misspent or the money is no longer needed, then CMS has the right to take money back.\n\nSlavitt said that CMS had managed to recover money back from states such as Maryland, and has so far recovered $200 million from states. It has also denied a number of funding requests by states this year, he said.\n\n\u201cIf we believe that there\u2019s money that has been either improperly spent or money part of a grant that\u2019s no longer needed we have every ability to collect that money and bring it back.\u201d\n\nDemocrats on the committee blasted Republicans for what they saw as hampering the implementation of the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cThe majorities\u2019 effort are simply designed to hamper implementation and undermine the Affordable Care Act regardless of the fact,\u201d Rep. Frank Pallone, R-N.J., said, after saying that the uninsured rate fell to 9 percent.", "article_metadata": {"prism.subsection1": "house", "classification": "/FOX NEWS/POLITICS/EXECUTIVE/Health care", "dcterms.modified": "2015-12-08 04:26:53 EST", "dcterms.abstract": "A top ObamaCare official was grilled Tuesday by lawmakers on the condition of state-run exchanges after many have been dogged by issues and others have been closed entirely, despite being given considerable federal funding.", "twitter": {"description": "A top ObamaCare official was grilled Tuesday by lawmakers on the condition of state-run exchanges after many have been dogged by issues and others have been closed entirely, despite being given considerable federal funding.", "creator": "@foxnews", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/12/08/lawmakers-grill-top-obamacare-official-over-cost-state-exchanges.html", "image": "http://a57.foxnews.com/media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2015/12/02/0/0/694940094001_4642295108001_120215-do-obamacare.jpg?ve=1", "title": "Lawmakers grill top ObamaCare official over cost of state exchanges", "site": "@foxnews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "dc.format": "text/html", "dc.publisher": "Fox News", "parsely-metadata": "{\"tags\":[\"/FOX NEWS/POLITICS/EXECUTIVE/Health care\"],\"author\":\"\",\"subSection\":\"politics/house\",\"title\":\"Lawmakers grill top ObamaCare official over cost of state exchanges\",\"image_url\":\"http://a57.foxnews.com/media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2015/12/02/0/0/694940094001_4642295108001_120215-do-obamacare.jpg?ve=1\",\"pub_date\":\"2015-12-08T20:53:00Z\",\"link\":\"http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/12/08/lawmakers-grill-top-obamacare-official-over-cost-state-exchanges.html\",\"type\":\"article\",\"identifier\":\"13b585de-c50b-481a-baac-35723cb19864\",\"section\":\"politics\"}", "prism.aggregationType": "subsection", "prism.channel": "fnc", "dc.description": "A top ObamaCare official was grilled Tuesday by lawmakers on the condition of state-run exchanges after many have been dogged by issues and others have been closed entirely, despite being given considerable federal funding.", "dc.identifier": "13b585de-c50b-481a-baac-35723cb19864", "dc.language": "en-US", "pagetype": "article", "classification-isa": "healthcare", "description": "A top ObamaCare official was grilled Tuesday by lawmakers on the condition of state-run exchanges after many have been dogged by issues and others have been closed entirely, despite being given considerable federal funding.", "prism.section": "politics", "fb": {"app_id": 113186182048399}, "dc.source": "FoxNews.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "dc.title": "Lawmakers Grill Top Obamacare Official Over Cost Of State Exchanges", "dcterms.created": "2015-12-08 04:26:53 EST", "og": {"site_name": "Fox News", "description": "A top ObamaCare official was grilled Tuesday by lawmakers on the condition of state-run exchanges after many have been dogged by issues and others have been closed entirely, despite being given considerable federal funding.", "title": "Lawmakers grill top ObamaCare official over cost of state exchanges | Fox News", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/12/08/lawmakers-grill-top-obamacare-official-over-cost-state-exchanges.html", "image": "http://a57.foxnews.com/media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2015/12/02/0/0/694940094001_4642295108001_120215-do-obamacare.jpg?ve=1", "type": "article"}, "dc.type": "Text.Article", "dc.date": "2015-12-08", "parsely-page": "{\"tags\":[\"/FOX NEWS/POLITICS/EXECUTIVE/Health care\"],\"author\":\"\",\"subSection\":\"politics/house\",\"title\":\"Lawmakers grill top ObamaCare official over cost of state exchanges\",\"image_url\":\"http://a57.foxnews.com/media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2015/12/02/0/0/694940094001_4642295108001_120215-do-obamacare.jpg?ve=1\",\"pub_date\":\"2015-12-08T20:53:00Z\",\"link\":\"http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/12/08/lawmakers-grill-top-obamacare-official-over-cost-state-exchanges.html\",\"post_id\":\"13b585de-c50b-481a-baac-35723cb19864\",\"type\":\"article\",\"section\":\"politics\"}"}, "article_summary": "State exchanges in Hawaii, Oregon and Nevada have all moved to Healthcare.gov -- now used by 38 states.\nThey\u2019ve failed but they\u2019ve spent all this money then later said \u2018gee sorry it didn\u2019t work out.\u2019 Does that seem appropriate?\u201d Murphy asked.\nA top ObamaCare official was grilled Tuesday by lawmakers over federal funds given to states to set up their own health care exchanges, after many have been dogged by issues and others have closed up shop entirely.\nRep.
