But coming out of a strong second-place showing in South Carolina on Saturday, he seems to be emphasizing them more and aiming his message at a broader audience.\n\n[GOP candidates chart different paths as race goes national on Super Tuesday]\n\n\"There are a lot of people here today,\" he said in Franklin, Tenn. \"Only a few of you have I ever met in person. I don't know your personal story. And yet I know this: Because you are Americans, you, like me, are just a generation or two removed from someone who made your future the purpose of their lives as well.\"\n\nHere in a ballroom at a casino hotel Sunday night, Rubio recalled recently being asked about the GOP's minority outreach and responding with a story about the ethnically diverse coalition of South Carolina leaders who backed him.\n\n\n\nRepublican presidential candidate Sen.

And I was standing next to the African American Republican senator from South Carolina. That sounds pretty minority to me.\"\n\nA central argument in Rubio's attempt to distinguish himself from Sen. Ted Cruz (Tex.) and Donald Trump is his oft-stated belief that he can unite the party more effectively and give Republicans a better chance to win the general election.\n\n\"We are the party of everyone. We are going to grow this party and take our message to everyone,\" Rubio said.\n\n[For Cruz and Rubio, the moment has arrived: A three-man race with Trump]\n\nThe pace of the primary campaign is beginning to pick up. A week after Tuesday's caucuses, a dozen states will hold nominating contests. Until now the votes have been spaced out and held one at a time so candidates have been able to tailor their messages accordingly.\n\nRubio is still hitting themes aimed at conservative audiences. For example, he promised Sunday to fight Obamacare and appoint Supreme Court justices who hew to the Constitution's original meaning.\n\nBut more and more, he's sounding a unity theme that an already nominated Republican would be expected to emphasize.\n\n\"Americans are the descendants of people that came here whether it was two centuries ago or two years ago because they refused to live in a society that told them that they could not be who they wanted to be,\" Rubio said in Franklin. \"America is the descendants of slaves who overcame that horrifying institution to claim their stake to the American dream.\"", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Florida senator tries to set himself apart from Donald Trump and Ted Cruz.", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "The Florida senator tries to set himself apart from Donald Trump and Ted Cruz.", "title": "Rubio sounding general election notes as GOP primary pace picks up", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/02/22/rubio-sounding-general-election-notes-as-gop-primary-pace-picks-up/", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/Wires/Images/2016-02-22/Getty/511685160.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@WaPoSean"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/02/22/rubio-sounding-general-election-notes-as-gop-primary-pace-picks-up/", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "rubio election; rubio campaign; rubio republicans;", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "rubio election; rubio campaign; rubio republicans;"}, "article_summary": "(Reuters)NORTH LAS VEGAS \u2014 Marco Rubio, enmeshed in a heated Republican presidential primary, is sounding more like a candidate pitching himself to a broader general election audience.\nRepublican presidential candidate Marco Rubio promises voters to bring together the Republican party \"faster than anyone else in this race.\"\nRepublican presidential candidate Sen.
