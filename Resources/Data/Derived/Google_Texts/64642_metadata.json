Lamar Smith, R-Texas, head of the House Committee on Science, Space and Technology.\n\nThe House of Representatives voted 237-190 on Wednesday afternoon to pass a bill that would limit the type of scientific research the Environmental Protection Agency can use when crafting regulations to protect the environment and public health.\n\nDubbed the \u201cSecret Science Reform Act of 2014,\u201d the bill\u2019s intention is to increase transparency at the EPA by making it so the agency can\u2019t use any science that is \u201chidden and flawed,\u201d according to bill sponsor Rep. Lamar Smith (R-TX). Smith and his Republican colleagues say the bill is needed so that the public can independently check the EPA\u2019s basis for issuing regulations limiting air and water pollutants from various sources.\n\nWhile the bill may sound noble on its face, scientists overwhelmingly take issue with its tenets. For one, they say, the bill does not understand why some scientific data is confidential \u2014 namely because much of it uses private medical data of voluntary test subjects to test pollutants, while some contains trade secrets and industry data.\n\n\u201cSome of the best real-world public health research, which relies on patient data like hospital admissions, would be excluded from consideration because personal data could not, and should not, be made public,\u201d wrote Union of Concerned Scientists director Andrew Rosenberg in Roll Call. \u201cDemanding public release of full raw data the agency cannot legally disclose is simply a way to accuse the agency of hiding something when it has nothing to hide.\u201d\n\nThis is the second time this week that the House has passed a bill seeking to hamper the activities of the EPA, despite there being no chance that either would become law. On Tuesday, the House quietly passed the Science Advisory Board Reform Act, which would make it easier for scientists with financial ties to corporations to advise the EPA, and prohibits independent scientists from talking about their own research on the board.\n\nRepublicans maintained on the House floor on Wednesday that their \u201cSecret Science\u201d bill wouldn\u2019t require that personal data or trade secrets be made public. Indeed, the bill states that \u201cNothing \u2026 shall be construed as requiring the public dissemination of information the disclosure of which is prohibited by law.\u201d Republicans maintain that data can still be used without disclosing personal information or trade secrets.\n\nThe White House disagrees, saying in a memo released Monday that doing so would cost the agency thousands of dollars for each scientific study it uses, thereby making it harder and more time-consuming to meet the requirements for each study it wants to use. Indeed, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) reports that the EPA relies on approximately 50,000 scientific studies per year, and that meeting the goals of the House \u201cSecret Science\u201d bill would cost between $10,000 and $30,000 per study.\n\nThe result, the CBO noted, would be that the number of studies relied upon by the EPA would be cut in half. That would mean EPA regulations based on less sound science, and less EPA regulations overall.\n\n\u201cIn short, the bill would undermine EPA\u2019s ability to protect the health of Americans, would impose expensive new mandates on EPA, and could impose substantial litigation costs on the Federal government,\u201d the White House memo reads. \u201cIt also could impede EPA\u2019s reliance on the best available science.\u201d\n\nOpponents of the legislation on Wednesday took to the floor to voice their outrage, saying the bill represented a \u201cwolf in sheep\u2019s clothing\u201d \u2014 a disingenuous play for \u201ctransparency\u201d within the EPA, when all Republicans really want is less EPA regulation.\n\n\u201cThe bill before us today is a wolf in sheep\u2019s clothing. It\u2019s a dangerous attack on the power of knowledge,\u201d said Rep. Katherine Clark (D-MA). \u201cRather than argue with the indisputable facts on air pollution \u2014 a losing bet \u2014 this bill attempts to discredit the science as secret, when in fact there\u2019s nothing secret about it. The only secret here is the true intent of this bill.\u201d\n\nRepublicans insisted this wasn\u2019t true, saying their only intent was increased transparency in EPA rulemaking. Many made comparisons to MIT economist Jonathan Gruber, who controversially stated that President Obama\u2019s health care law only succeeded because of a lack of political transparency in the administration, and \u201cthe stupidity of the American voter.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy the defensiveness about transparency? Why the defensiveness about the truth? Why the defensiveness about more participation as it relates to science?\u201d asked Rep. Peter Roskam (R-IL). \u201cWhat they have to defend is the orthodoxy that allowed the other side to create Obamacare and the architect of Obamacare, Jonathan Gruber, said this is a tortured way to make sure [the Congressional Budget Office] scores it this way and so forth and so on.\u201d\n\nRep. Randy Weber (R-TX), a co-sponsor of the bill, also brought Gruber into the conversation.\n\n\u201cIt makes you kind of wonder if the opponents of this legislation, like Mr. Gruber, believe that the American people are \u2018too stupid to understand\u2019 the costly impact of the EPA\u2019s overreaching regulations,\u201d he said. \u201cTrust me when I say Americans are not stupid, and they deserve and demand the truth from the start.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "Opponents of the legislation argued on the House floor that the bill represented a \"wolf in sheep's clothing\" -- a disingenuous play for \"transparency\" within the EPA, when all Republicans really want is less EPA regulation.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "Opponents of the legislation argued on the House floor that the bill represented a \"wolf in sheep's clothing\" -- a disingenuous play for \"transparency\" within the EPA, when all Republicans really want is less EPA regulation.", "title": "House Passes Bill To Stop EPA From Using \u2018Secret Science\u2019 To Craft Pollution Rules", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/climate/2014/11/19/3594566/house-passes-epa-secret-science-bill/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/AP100810021913.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Opponents of the legislation argued on the House floor that the bill represented a \"wolf in sheep's clothing\" -- a disingenuous play for \"transparency\" within the EPA, when all Republicans really want is less EPA regulation.", "creator": "@@emorwee", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/AP100810021913-320x213.jpg", "title": "House Passes Bill To Stop EPA From Using \u2018Secret Science\u2019 To Craft Pollution Rules", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-climate", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/AP100810021913.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/AP100810021913.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2014-11-19T16:56:49+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/emorweee"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fceb04\"", "article_summary": "Climate House Passes Bill To Stop EPA From Using \u2018Secret Science\u2019 To Craft Pollution Rules CREDIT: AP Photo/Drew Angerer Rep.
