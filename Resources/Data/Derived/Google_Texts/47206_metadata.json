She would like to receive physical education credit for the time she spends training. ( Mark Blakley )\n\nHigh school freshman Jenna Culotta, 14, has a cowboy hat, a horse named Scarlett and a talent for rodeo barrel racing. That means she rides Scarlett like a race car driver around a three-barrel loop.\n\nWhat Jenna would like, please (the rule book says rodeo riders must strive to be well-mannered) is physical education credit for the hours of practice that have made her a barrel race contender.\n\nCalifornia ranks third in the nation in the number of high school rodeo riders, trailing Texas and Idaho, although the number is small -\u2013 just 595 California high school students are registered with the National High School Rodeo Association.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a dying sport,\u201d said Christie Baute. She\u2019s the mother of two rodeo contestants in the Los Angeles County town of Agua Dulce, near Santa Clarita. \u201cAnd those of us who are involved are passionate about it.\u201d\n\nBut the idea of P.E. credit for the sport is anathema to physical education teachers. Barrel racing, goat tying and bull riding aren\u2019t interscholastic sports, they say, and rodeo competitors aren\u2019t coached by school coaches or supervised by school supervisors.\n\n\u201cHow in the world can you consider having something that is totally out of a school district\u2019s ability to oversee get credit?\u201d said Keith Johannes, with the California Association for Health, Physical Education, Recreation and Dance, a membership organization for P.E. teachers.\n\n\u201cThat physical education matters so little that they would not even care to see what\u2019s going on,\u201d Johannes said. \u201cIt is the ultimate put-down for physical education.\u201d\n\nBill Under Consideration in Sacramento\n\nNow the riders\u2019 quest for physical education credit, and the privileges such credit would bring, has captured the attention of state Sen. Jean Fuller (R-Bakersfield).\n\nFuller, who said she grew up in the small Kern County town of Shafter where her No. 1 hobby was a horse, is the author of Senate Bill 138, which would clarify to local school boards that they are free to award high school physical education credit to rodeo competitors, if they would like to do so.\n\nRodeo competitors say the bill would give them the cherished perquisites enjoyed by other high school athletes who receive physical education credit for their sports: the right to opt out of the state graduation requirement of two years of P.E. instruction; time in their school schedules (because they\u2019re not enrolled in P.E.) to take other requirements or study halls; and, most important, an \u201callowed absence\u201d when they leave school early to travel to faraway rodeos.\n\nThe bill passed the Senate and is scheduled for a July 1 hearing in the Assembly Education Committee.\n\nAt a committee hearing this spring, Fuller said a group of high school rodeo competitors approached her in Bishop last year and asked her to bring the bill forward. Their intelligence, fitness and ambition to reach the top of the high school rodeo world impressed her, she said. In the gallery of the hearing room sat about a dozen high school rodeo competitors, in cowboy hats and Western yoke-style shirts.\n\n\u201cI ask you today to look in their eyes to see if we, as adults, should limit them in any way,\u201d Fuller said.\n\nAt the hearing, Cindy Lederer, a 35-year veteran teacher of physical education and a representative of the California Association for Health, Physical Education, Recreation and Dance, voiced the group\u2019s \u201cextreme opposition\u201d to the bill.\n\n\u201cCalifornia was the first state to mandate physical education minutes at all levels,\u201d Lederer said. \u201cHowever, those minutes are disappearing, due to the House and Senate who are constantly creating exemptions and passing bills like this one.\u201d\n\nTechnically, school boards already have the right to grant physical education credit to rodeo competitors or, for that matter, to any activity the boards deem worthy.\n\nIn the Stanislaus County city of Oakdale \u2014 its official slogan is \u201cCowboy Capital of the World\u201d \u2014 Oakdale High School has recognized rodeo as a sport for 20 years, said Leandra Spence, adviser to the Oakdale High School rodeo club, at the hearing.\n\nBut Fuller said school boards would feel more comfortable if rodeo were listed in the regulations along with two other specifically identified activities that can earn physical education credit: Junior Reserve Officer Training Corps and marching band.\n\nStephanie Nabors raised three high school rodeo competitors in Mariposa, and one of them is now a member of the Fresno State University rodeo team. \u201cI would like them to be treated like any other athlete,\u201d she said. When her daughters missed school on Fridays for a rodeo, they had to take time during the rodeo to complete a written assignment about physical education to pick up the credit.\n\n\u201cThese kids are working their butts off,\u201d Nabors said. \u201cIt\u2019s 110 degrees. They shouldn\u2019t have to sit down and write a two-page essay because they\u2019re not in a one-hour P.E. class.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think it would help,\u201d Culotta, the 14-year-old rodeo rider, said of receiving P.E. credit for her rodeo practices and competitions. She said she would use the time for homework, which would be useful in the fall when she is a freshman at Saugus High School in Santa Clarita.\n\nYet even if the bill becomes law, the decision to grant physical education credit will remain up to the local school board. Jeff Hallman, athletic director of Saugus High School, said he\u2019d never heard of P.E. credit for rodeo riders.\n\n\u201cOur district has guidelines about who is able to get out of physical education,\u201d Hallman said. \u201cUnless you\u2019re a world-class athlete going to the Olympics kind of person, you\u2019re probably not going to get out of P.E.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Student rodeo riders and their parents are lobbying for it, but the idea is anathema to physical education teachers.", "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"Should High School Rodeo Riders Get P.E.
