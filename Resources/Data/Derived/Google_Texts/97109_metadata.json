The bill comes after several court cases triggered by election procedures during Colorado\u2019s September recalls of former Senate President John Morse and former Sen. Angela Giron.\n\nSponsors say the bill would set an earlier deadline for replacement candidates to petition onto the ballot. Instead of 15 days before the final election day, the deadline would be 15 days before clerks send out mail ballots. The aim is to give more time for overseas voters and others who vote by mail to weigh in on recall efforts. The reform bill would also change some of the rules for how the petitions to start a recall election are run in the first place \u2014 including transparency training for circulators.\n\n\u201cThis legislation updates a lot of old, dusty statutes, ensuring we prevent fraud in the petitioning process and have accessible elections. We want to give voters ample opportunity to exercise their right to vote,\u201d Sen. Pat Steadman of Denver, one of the bill\u2019s sponsors, said in a statement.\n\nThe legislation would also eliminate an aspect of recall elections \u2014 a two-part ballot in which a voter can only select a replacement candidate if they vote \u201cyes\u201d on the recall in the first place \u2014 that has been found to be unconstitutional.\n\nSenate Minority Leader, Republican Bill Cadman of Colorado Springs, said that the bill is obviously motivated by the two recall elections that ousted Democrats last fall and he believes the question of whether and how to reform recall election procedures should be put to a statewide vote.\n\nCadman wasn\u2019t the only Republican to lampoon the proposed legislation hours after it was introduced. Secretary of State Scott Gessler, whom the bill\u2019s sponsors say was given ample opportunity to weigh in on the measure during a three-month stakeholder process, was equally dismissive of the proposed recall election law cleanup.\n\nKurtis Lee of the Denver Post reports that Gessler said the legislation \u201cdoubles down\u201d on what the Secretary believes are failed election policies \u2014 otherwise known as last session\u2019s contentious election modernization act which instituted all mail ballots, same day voter registration and shorter residency requirements. Like Cadman, Gessler also argued that the legislation is a constitutional overreach.\n\nThe sponsors countered that the legislation should be non-partisan because complex and contradictory recall election laws doesn\u2019t serve anyone, least of all the voters who have the right to recall elected officials from office\n\n\u201cWe live in America, a country founded on democratic participation. We want every eligible voter to vote in every election. In the past recall elections, we had dismal voter turnouts,\u201d said co-sponsor Sen. Matt Jones of Louisville in a statement. \u201cThis update allows enough time that everyone will get a mail ballot, ensuring our military troops overseas can participate, as well.\u201d\n\nThe bill, introduced today, has been assigned to the Senate State, Veterans, & Military Affairs committee.\n\n\n\nWhen is it Jessica\u2019s Law?\n\nJessica\u2019s Law, named after the child victim of a violent assault case in Florida, refers to laws that have been passed in states throughout the country setting mandatory minimum sentences for child sex offenders. Colorado Republicans have proposed the legislation for the past couple of years, but with no success. This year is different. Democrats today gave initial passage in the House to HB 1260, a slightly softer version of the bill, followed by an amendment to name it \u201cJessica\u2019s Law\u201d after the 10-year-old whose attack inspired a national movement.\n\nDemocratic support for a modified version of the Jessica\u2019s Law bill, lead by sponsor Mike Foote, a Democrat from Lafayette, enraged Republicans who accused Democrats of stealing the issue from them. Because the bill lacks a mandatory sentence of 25 years for first offenders, they argued it doesn\u2019t merit the name \u201cJessica\u2019s Law.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is simply playing politics with our children for the second year in a row,\u201d said Rep. Libby Szabo of Arvada, who has tried to carry the stricter legislation in PAST sessions.\n\nFoote said his bill is simply the Colorado version of the Florida law. He added that more than half of the other states who\u2019ve passed such a law \u2014 including Washington, Oregon, New Mexico, Wyoming, and both Dakotas \u2014 have amended it in some way. He added that Jessica\u2019s family has voiced support for his legislation.\n\nFoote\u2019s version of Jessica\u2019s Law would tier the mandatory minimums for someone who sexually assaults a child beginning with 10 years for a class four felony and ranging up to 24 years for a class two felony.\n\nIn debate over whether the bill could be amended on the floor to more closely resemble the original Florida legislation, Rep. Frank McNulty of Highlands Ranch became enraged by what he considered the watering down of the measure.\n\n\u201cMichael, this is the worst kind of politics. You should be ashamed of yourself,\u201d McNulty admonished Foote from the floor before being silenced by the sitting speaker.\n\nEventually the House gave the bill initial approval.\n\n\u201cThis is about remembering Jessica. This is about a Colorado solution that addresses this horrific crime,\u201d said Rep. Dan Pabon of Commerce City.\n\nThe bill will be back for final approval, likely this week.\n\nSenate moves to extend standard co-pay to physical therapy, chiropractors, massage therapists and acupuncturists\n\nWith the contentious Affordable Care Act sign-up deadline approaching at the end of the month, the Senate today debated the merits of preventative and alternative care in a surprisingly bipartisan way. HB 1108 would mandate that standard copay fees apply to physical and occupational therapy as well as visits to chiropractors, acupuncturist sand massage therapists. The bill is sponsored by moderate Democrat Sen. Lois Tochtrop of Thornton.\n\nTochtrop said the legislation would ultimately save everyone money on health care by encouraging patients to get adequate rehabilitation to avoid repeat surgeries on critical areas like bung knees or hips. She also sees the legislation as a way to strike out against Colorado\u2019s spiraling prescription drug addition.\n\nSome legislators on both sides of the aisle derided the bill as a mandate would cause insurance rates to go up.\n\nSenator Irene Aguilar of Denver, who is a physician, lamented that the bill put her at odds with Tochtrop, with whom she generally agrees. Aguilar said the bill would not, in effect, make this kind of alternative care more affordable. Thought it would cap co-pays, consumers would see those costs on the other end when they pay their premiums, she argued.\n\nAguilar proposed an amendment to chop everything but occupational and physical therapy from the legislation, noting that both forms of treatment are part of the Affordable Care Acts essential benefits.\n\nThe mere mention of the ACA lured Republicans to the floor. Sen. David Balmer of Centennial said he and his colleagues are in no mood to start telling people what qualifies as standard co-pay care.\n\n\u201cNow that we\u2019re in this cesspool, let\u2019s not make it about deciding what kinds of providers make the cut,\u201d he said.\n\nAguilar\u2019s amendment failed, as did the bill itself on first vote. Tochtrop appealed that decision and the measure scraped through for a final vote this week.\n\n\n\nLegislature celebrates St. Patrick\u2019s Day\n\nIn the House today, Rep. Cherylin Peniston of Westminster ran a cross-the-aisle guessing game involving a jar of more than 2,000 green chocolate balls. Rep. Polly Lawrence of Littleton made the closest guess about the number of candies and was awarded both the chocolate and an elegant green sports coat that traditionally has been passed back and forth in the House around St. Patrick\u2019s Day. Peniston announced Lawrence as the winner with the following limerick:\n\n\u201cThere once was a leg named polly\n\nwho learned her math skills\n\nin construction, by golly.\n\nshe calculated each chocolate ball\n\nwithin 68 of the exact number did she fall,\n\nwhich earned her the House green jacket, folly.\u201d\n\nOutside the House chambers, a gaggle of irish dancers performed in honor of the day:\n\nCreating community alerts for violent hit and runs\n\nWhile members of the House made merry on St. Patrick\u2019s Day, the tone was more solemn in the Senate as that chamber contemplated HB 1191, a bill that would create a public alert about hit-and-run accidents in the style of the \u201cAmber alert'\u201d that notifies communities of a child abduction. The alter program would allow public safety officials to inform the public when there has been a hit and run resulting in death or serious injury and seek or share any information \u2014 such as car color, direction of travel, or plate number \u2014 that may help lead to an arrest.\n\nThe bill\u2019s sponsor, Sen. Steve King of Grand Junction, noted the alert system is vital because hit and runs are the third most difficult kind of case to crack after arson and homicide.\n\nSen. Mike Johnston of Denver came to the floor thanking King for running the bill. He told the story of a dear friend who lost his daughter and two baby girls crossing 15th Street when a drunk-driver ran a red light.\n\n\u201cThe only reason they found him was because his plate was wedged in the stroller,\u201d Johnston said.\n\nHe added that in tragedies like his friend\u2019s, people just want to help. He said the bill would give the public those tools.\n\nThe measure passed handily on its first vote in the Senate. It will come up for a final vote this week.\n\nFerrets all the way down\n\nHB 1267, a measure to allow counties and municipalities to partner with the federal Fish and Wildlife Service to re-introduce the endangered back-footed ferret onto their lands, hit an unexpected snag in the House today when Rep. Jerry Sonnenberg of Sterling worried that the measure might unintentionally hinder oil and gas development.\n\nThe bill\u2019s sponsor, Rep. Randy Fischer Fort Collins, said that wasn\u2019t the intent of the bill. In lieu of an amendment, he added clarification in a legislative declaration to clarify that the measure was about ferrets, not fracking. The bill was further narrowed to just three trial communities for the first five years.\n\nRep. Tim Dore of Elizabeth, who supported similar legislation that applied just to privately-owned lands last year, said the trial phase was a good idea.\n\nHe said the introduction of the ferrets sometimes pushes prairie dogs into unintended acreage. After all, he noted, \u201cThe prairie dog population doesn\u2019t tend to want to just hang out and get eaten, so they move next door\u2026\u201d\n\nEleven other states have similar legislation to preserve the black-footed ferret, which is one of the most endangered species in North America.\n\nThe House gave the measure initial approval and will revisit it for a final vote this week.\n\nSenate procrastinates contentious controlled burns bill\n\nAfter HB 1007 saw major heat in the House, the Senate was primed for debate on the bill to allow county commissioners to regulate when farmers schedule their controlled burns. Though the bill has a Democratic sponsor Rep. Millie Hamner of Dillon in the House and Republican sponsor, Sen. Larry Crowder of Alamosa in the Senate, many GOP legislators representing rural districts have come out in opposition to the bill.\n\nToday the Senate procrastinated on giving the bill a final vote. First, senators delayed the vote until May 8, but then changed their minds and said they\u2019d get to it tomorrow.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Colorado Independent", "description": "Notes from the 69th day of the 2014 legislative session.", "title": "Controversial recall election reform introduced; Senate debates alternative care coverage while House bickers over mandatory minimums for pedophiles", "url": "http://www.coloradoindependent.com/146526/controversial-recall-election-reform-introduced-senate-debates-alternative-care-coverage-while-house-bickers-over-mandatory-minimums-for-pedophiles", "image": "http://coloradoindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/cap-note.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "google-site-verification": "i2NY0iV2fHy9AAYv78ajpH43BN_IO8SUYAgP0XBcpQs", "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://coloradoindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/cap-note.jpg?w=640"}, "site": "@COIndependent", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1", "article": {"published_time": "2014-03-18T05:46:42+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-03-18T05:46:42+00:00", "author": "http://www.coloradoindependent.com/author/tessa-cheek"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8b72\"", "article_summary": "Controversial recall election reform introduced; Senate debates alternative care coverage while House bickers over mandatory minimums for pedophilesWrangling over recall reform billToday Democrats introduced SB 158, a bill designed to bring Colorado\u2019s recall election statutes into line with the state constitution while still allowing for all-mail ballots.\nWe want to give voters ample opportunity to exercise their right to vote,\u201d Sen.
