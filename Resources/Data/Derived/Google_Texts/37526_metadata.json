Each state has a different emissions cutback goal and a unique plan to meet it based on how power is generated in the state and other factors.\n\nThe states whose governors are banking on winning their lawsuit against the EPA are preparing for the Clean Power Plan anyway, not just because they are hedging their bets, but because they\u2019re hearing from industry that if they don\u2019t prepare for it, coal-based power companies will be at a competitive disadvantage in the future, Becker said.\n\n\u201cWe were in the same pickle three years ago when a dozen governors or attorneys general were suing EPA over whether or not EPA had authority to require permits for greenhouse gases,\u201d Becker told Climate Central on Wednesday. \u201cWhile that was going on, these same states as well as the rest of the states were earnestly trying to adopt legislation and regulatory authority to make the permitting program work. The same thing is happening now.\u201d\n\nKentucky, a major coal-producing state and a NACAA member that is among 12 states suing to stop the Clean Power Plan, is holding stakeholder meetings \u2014 21 of them so far \u2014 but no other preliminary work is being done there to prepare for implementing the Clean Power Plan just in case it survives legal challenges and is eventually finalized, John Lyons, Kentucky assistant secretary for climate policy, told Climate Central on Wednesday.\n\nIn South Dakota, which is not a member of NACAA but is among the states suing the EPA, regulators are still finalizing their comments on the Clean Power Plan, but are generally opposed to it because the CO2 emissions cuts outlined in the plan would require coal-fired power plants in the state to be shut down, Brian Gustafson, administrator of the South Dakota Air Quality Program, told Climate Central.\n\nHe said he is unsure what the state\u2019s options will be if the Clean Power Plan goes into effect, adding that 74 percent of the state\u2019s electric power comes from hydroelectric generators and other renewables, but they don\u2019t count toward the state\u2019s EPA-recommended emissions reductions goals.\n\nThe EPA has repeatedly declined to discuss on the record how it devised each state\u2019s CO2 emissions reductions goal. The agency will not allow journalists to speak to EPA experts about the details of the Clean Power Plan.\n\nRich Alonso, an attorney at the law firm Bracewell and Giuliani representing energy companies and utilities, said the Clean Power Plan will impact utilities more than any other rule the EPA has ever proposed.\n\nSpeaking at SEJ, Alonso said the Clean Power Plan\u2019s call for coal-fired power plants to implement energy efficiency measures could be costly for utilities, and if it were possible for utilities to make their power plants any more efficient, power plant operators would have done so already as a cost cutting measure.\n\nWhatever the fate of the Clean Power Plan, utilities know that coal burning for electricity generation has an uncertain future, he said.\n\n\u201cThere is no such thing as a coal-fired electric utility in the country right now,\u201d he said. \u201cEveryone who burns coal burns natural gas. Everybody\u2019s diversifying. Coal is on the way out, there\u2019s no doubt about it.\u201d\n\nA coal processing operation.

We\u2019re going from 95 percent capacity in terms of electric generation provided by coal to 78 percent by 2020.\u201d\n\nHe said Kentucky is still writing its comments to the EPA about the Clean Power Plan.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got 17 pages of concerns, so I\u2019m not sure I\u2019d categorize that as accepting of the proposal,\u201d Lyons said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of opposition in this state to that plan. We as regulators are just trying to absorb what that rule is prescribing.\u201d\n\nBecker compared the Clean Power Plan to the Affordable Care Act, saying both are complicated, costly and facing a wave of opposition from politicians who want to see their demise.\n\nBut the industry may eventually support the Clean Power Plan, he said.\n\n\u201cIs it going to be easy for everyone? No,\u201d Becker said. \u201cThe alternative is to do nothing more with greenhouse gases, and that\u2019s not an option. Reducing greenhouse gases is going to make things more efficient and vice-versa. It\u2019s going to make things cheaper in industry operations.\u201d\n\nBarring delays caused by legal challenges, the EPA is expecting to finalize the Clean Power Plan by mid-2015. Public comments on the plan are being taken through October.\n\nYou May Also Like:\n\nA Tale of Two Cities: Miami, New York and Life on the Edge\n\nWarming Puts Emperor Penguins at Risk of Extinction\n\nNew Greenland Ice Melt Fuels Sea Level Rise Concerns\n\nMassive Iceberg Breaks off Pine Island Glacier in Antarctica\n\nSoaring Temps in West Antarctica May Fuel Sea Level Rise", "article_metadata": {"description": "Sue the Obama Administration to derail its plan to slash carbon dioxide emissions from coal-fired power plants, but prepare for the cuts anyway.", "og": {"image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://assets.climatecentral.org/images/made/01-10-14_Guard_aussie_coal_600_315_s_c1_c_c.jpg", "height": 315}, "title": "States Suing to Stop CO2 Cuts Prep For Them Anyway"}, "twitter": {"description": "Sue the Obama Administration to derail its plan to slash carbon dioxide emissions from coal-fired power plants, but prepare for the cuts anyway.", "title": "States Suing to Stop CO2 Cuts Prep For Them Anyway", "image": "http://assets.climatecentral.org/images/made/01-10-14_Guard_aussie_coal_600_315_s_c1_c_c.jpg", "creator": "@bobbymagill", "site": "@climatecentral", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "RepostUsAPIKey": "5fecfdbc7abba92a63dd2fe9faddcd49", "date": "2014-09-11", "keywords": "Clean Power Plan, EPA, CO2, carbon emissions, carbon dioxide emissions, existing power plants, coal-fired power plants, climate change, global warming, climate scientist, global warming facts, causes of global warming, effects of global warming, global climate change, agw, anthropogenic global warming, climate change facts, recent climate change", "news_keywords": "Clean Power Plan, EPA, CO2, carbon emissions, carbon dioxide emissions, existing power plants, coal-fired power plants, climate change, global warming, climate scientist, global warming facts, causes of global warming, effects of global warming, global climate change, agw, anthropogenic global warming, climate change facts, recent climate change"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc30e\"", "article_summary": "States Suing to Stop CO2 Cuts Prep For Them AnywayPublished: September 11th, 2014Sue the Obama Administration to derail its plan to slash carbon dioxide emissions from coal-fired power plants, but prepare for the cuts anyway.\nThe Clean Power Plan is the Obama administration\u2019s proposal to slash CO2 emissions from existing coal-fired power plants by 30 percent below 2005 levels by 2030.\nThe agency will not allow journalists to speak to EPA experts about the details of the Clean Power Plan.\nBut the industry may eventually support the Clean Power Plan, he said.\nWhatever the fate of the Clean Power Plan, utilities know that coal burning for electricity generation has an uncertain future, he said."}
