And that\u2019s often what we see with HHS.\u201d\n\nThe AAF report is based on government-wide Information Collection Budgets compiled as part of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. According to those ICBs, HHS in 2008 imposed roughly 412 million hours of paperwork. By 2016, hundreds of new ACA regulations helped push HHS\u2019s paperwork burden to roughly 700 million hours. The next closest agency, the Securities and Exchange Commission, imposes 225 million hours.\n\n\u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be that surprising,\u201d said Batkins, AAF\u2019s director of regulatory policy. \u201cWhen you fundamentally redo health care, and establish exchanges, and expand Medicaid and create a million different rules for tax credits and exemptions, there\u2019s going to be some associated forms of paperwork with it.\u201d\n\nThe AAF is part of the American Action Network, a think-tank started by Norm Coleman, a former Republican senator from Minnesota, and Fred Malek, a longtime Republican fundraiser and strategist. But nonpartisan analysts have also questioned the benefits of the president\u2019s signature legislative achievement.\n\nJust two months before the AAF report, a 22-page December analysis from the Congressional Budget Office concluded that Obamacare will cost the American economy the equivalent of 2 million jobs by 2025.\n\n\u201cThe labor force is projected to be about 2 million full-time-equivalent workers smaller in 2025 under the ACA than it would have been otherwise,\u201d according to the CBO study. \u201cThree-quarters of that decline will occur because of health insurance expansions, which raise effective tax rates on earnings from labor.\u201d\n\n\u201cSome people would choose to work fewer hours; others would leave the labor force entirely or remain unemployed for longer than they otherwise would,\u201d according to the CBO, which crunches economic numbers for both parties in Congress.\n\nThe AAF and CBO reports come as the Affordable Care Act is again front-and-center in an election year, with Republican presidential candidates vowing on the campaign trail to gut Obamacare, and Democrats insisting the president\u2019s namesake isn\u2019t going anywhere without a fight.\n\nTexas Sen. Ted Cruz promises to repeal the ACA completely, while GOP front-runner Donald Trump has said he will replace Obamacare with \u201csomething better.\u201d\n\nEven Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton has acknowledged the ACA needs to be streamlined.\n\n\u201cPart of the challenge is to clear away all the smoke and try to figure out what is working and what isn\u2019t,\u201d Clinton said days ago at a forum in Florida. \u201cThis is going to be challenging and I don\u2019t think we should throw the baby out with the bath.\u201d\n\nThe Obama administration has steadfastly brushed aside criticism of the ACA\u2019s impact on the economy, repeatedly citing a record 72 straight months of private sector job gains.\n\nHouse and Senate Republicans two months ago sent a long-promised repeal of most of the ACA to the White House, where the president promptly vetoed the bill. But House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wisc., has promised to have a replacement for Obamacare ready to go by the time a new president takes office next year.\n\n\u201cThe idea that Obamacare is the law of the land for good is a myth,\u201d the Wisconsin Republican said in January. \u201cThis law will collapse under its own weight, or it will be repealed.\u201d\n\nAccording to a 2014 study led by Harvard Medical School researchers, paperwork consumes about one-sixth of a typical American physician\u2019s day \u2014 due largely to changes to U.S. health policy dictated by Obamacare.\n\nThe 2014 study, published in the International Journal of Health Services, predicted the trend would continue cutting into the time doctors spend with patients.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Two years after an eye-popping survey\u00a0on U.S. doctors struggling to deal with growing administrative demands\u00a0on health-care practitioners,\u00a0a new study\u00a0has", "og": {"site_name": "InsideSources", "description": "Two years after an eye-popping survey\u00a0on U.S. doctors struggling to deal with growing administrative demands\u00a0on health-care practitioners,\u00a0a new study\u00a0has", "title": "Report: Obamacare Fuels Massive Growth in HHS Paperwork \u2013 InsideSources", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://www.insidesources.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/bigstock-Medical-Paperwork-91420340.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-03-09T08:59:39+00:00", "url": "http://www.insidesources.com/obamacare-fuels-massive-growth-in-hhs-paperwork/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Two years after an eye-popping survey\u00a0on U.S. doctors struggling to deal with growing administrative demands\u00a0on health-care practitioners,\u00a0a new study\u00a0has", "title": "Report: Obamacare Fuels Massive Growth in HHS Paperwork \u2013 InsideSources", "image": "http://www.insidesources.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/bigstock-Medical-Paperwork-91420340.jpg", "creator": "@InsideSourcesDC", "site": "@InsideSourcesDC", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.insidesources.com", "section": "Politics", "tag": "paperwork burden", "published_time": "2016-03-09T00:46:14+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-03-09T08:59:39+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "According to those ICBs, HHS in 2008 imposed roughly 412 million hours of paperwork.\nBy 2016, hundreds of new ACA regulations helped push HHS\u2019s paperwork burden to roughly 700 million hours.\nThe next closest agency, the Securities and Exchange Commission, imposes 225 million hours.\n\u201cWhenever we\u2019re talking about forms, or paperwork or costs, we have to realize that someone has to bear those costs,\u201d Batkins told InsideSources.\n\u201cThe idea that Obamacare is the law of the land for good is a myth,\u201d the Wisconsin Republican said in January."}
