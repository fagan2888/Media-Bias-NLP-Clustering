The 65-page document claims that the administration\u2019s policies have helped stabilize the nation\u2019s fiscal condition by slashing the deficit and creating a plan to stabilize the it as a share of the country\u2019s Gross Domestic Product.\n\nOMB projects the 2015 deficit will be $455 billion, a reduction of $128 billion below the original estimate. It\u2019s expected to fall to as low as 2.2 percent of GDP by 2018 before beginning to climb again. OMB additionally estimates that the deficit will stabilize at 2.7 percent of GDP in five to ten years.\n\nRelated: Wall Street Should Pay for the Recessions They Cause\n\nThe White House\u2019s deficit triumphalism is a bit ironic, given the fact that much of the reduction the OMB report trumpets is the result of across-the-board spending cuts known as sequestration, which became law as part of the Budget Control Act of 2011. The White House has very publicly indicated that wants to do away with those cuts in future budgets.\n\nBudget hawks, including economists from the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, were unimpressed with the OMB report, essentially grading the current outlook as \u201cbetter than nothing\u201d but not particularly good.\n\n\u201cOverall, the MSR doesn't really change the outlook for the President's policies,\u201d CFRB said in a release. \u201cThey are an improvement over the status quo but don't do enough to ensure debt is on a clear downward path as a share of GDP over the long term. The budget would need to go further, particularly on entitlement reform, to accomplish that.\u201d\n\nThe MSR spends a considerable amount of time criticizing Republican Congressional budget proposals, particularly their adherence to the sequester.\n\nThe Republican plan, according to the White House, \u201cwould lock in the mindless austerity of sequestration and weaken America\u2019s economy at a time of accelerating growth.\u201d\n\nRelated: Illinois Is Not Alone \u2013 States Facing $1 Trillion Pension Shortfall\n\nThe MSR also takes the GOP to task for a budget gimmick that allows the budget sequester to fall on domestic spending programs, but not the military. The proposal would funnel billions of dollars to the military through an off-budget account for Overseas Contingency Operations, which is not supposed to be used for normal defense spending.\n\n\u201cThis approach fails to provide the stable, multi-year budget on which defense planning is based, undermines a mechanism meant to fund incremental costs of overseas conflicts, and locks in unacceptable funding cuts for national security activities at non-defense agencies such as State, USAID, and Homeland Security.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The White House Office of Management claimed that the administration\u2019s policies have stabilize the nation\u2019s fiscal condition.
