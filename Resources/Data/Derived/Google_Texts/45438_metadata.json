Parker wasn\u2019t playing for France, and Spain had Pau Gasol back in its ranks, besides playing at home.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a painful and disappointing defeat,\u201d Pau said. \u201cWe had such high expectations and had played so well until now.\u201d\n\nSpain had averaged 88 points per game through its first six wins, all blowouts. But France cut off Spain\u2019s passing lanes and forced it into solo efforts.\n\nSpain\u2019s guards didn\u2019t adjust by looking for Pau and Marc Gasol in the post enough, and then compounded that by missing all but two of their 22 attempts from beyond the 3-point arc.\n\n\u201cEveryone thought we had won this before it started, but we didn\u2019t prepare well for the game and were trying to play catchup the entire way,\u201d Spain guard Juan Carlos Navarro said. \u201cThey prepared better than we did. We relied on doing what we always do, defend and get out on the break, but our shots didn\u2019t fall, and they played with a lot of poise.\u201d\n\nBoris Diaw scored 15 points and Thomas Heurtel added 13 for a France team which pulled in 50 rebounds to Spain\u2019s 28.\n\nPau had 17 for Spain, but his brother Marc and Serge Ibaka each went 1-of-7 from the field to combine for just 5 points.\n\nSerbia awaits France on Friday after it routed Brazil 84-56 in the other quarterfinal.\n\nThe U.S. plays Lithuania in the other semifinal in Barcelona on Thursday.\n\nPau scored in the post to spark Spain\u2019s 12-4 run to open the third period and edge ahead 40-39.\n\nA brief scuffle marred that span when France\u2019s Florent Pietrus slapped Sergi Llull in the back of the head after an argument. Pietrus was awarded an unsporstmanlike technical foul.\n\nSpain entered the final period with a one-point lead but without any clear plan of attack.\n\nDiaw nailed a backbreaking 3 after France again beat Spain to the offensive boards to take a 51-45 lead and force Juan Orenga to call time-out with 6:41 left.\n\nA contested jumper by Pau brought Spain to within three points with under two to play, but Heurtel scored five points to quash the comeback and spark chants for Orenga\u2019s resignation in a loss that hurt almost as much as the Spanish football team\u2019s early elimination from this summer\u2019s World Cup.\n\nPau left open the possibility that this was his last game for Spain, which he has led to one world championship in 2006, two Olympic silver medals, and two European titles.\n\n\u201cYou never know when your last game or tournament will be,\u201d the new Chicago Bull center said. \u201cI would like to play until I am 50, but I doubt it. We have great young players coming up and I\u2019m sure that we have a good team in the future.\u201d\n\nWhether or not Pau continues, Spain will likely not have such a chance to try and finally beat the U.S. with Pau now 34, and the Olympics two years away.\n\nSerbia\u2019s result also reversed a group matchup, as Serbia lost to Brazil last Wednesday, when Spain also beat France.\n\nThis time, Brazil and its trio of NBA centers in Varejao, Tiago Splitter and Nene were ineffective, as Serbia bettered the bigger Brazilians inside and out, and turned a five-point halftime advantage into a rout by outscoring Brazil 29-10 in the third period.\n\nSerbia was led by guard Milos Teodosic, who scored 23 points, hit three 3-pointers, and made four assists. Shooting guard Bogdan Bogdanovic scored 12 points, and centers Miroslav Raduljica and Nenad Krstic added 10 each.\n\nVarejao and Vieira had 12 points each for Brazil.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "France upsets Spain 65-52 in FIBA World Cup quarterfinals", "title": "France upsets Spain 65-52 in FIBA World Cup quarterfinals", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/09/11/france-upsets-spain-65-52-in-fiba-world-cup-quarterfinals/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140911_092913_evan-fournier.jpg", "height": 436}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140911_092913_evan-fournier.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-09-11T09:31:11+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T05:00:55+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda799\"", "article_summary": "MADRID \u2014 France upset Spain 65-52 in front of its stunned fans in the quarterfinals of the Basketball World Cup on Wednesday.\nParker wasn\u2019t playing for France, and Spain had Pau Gasol back in its ranks, besides playing at home.\nPau scored in the post to spark Spain\u2019s 12-4 run to open the third period and edge ahead 40-39.\nSerbia\u2019s result also reversed a group matchup, as Serbia lost to Brazil last Wednesday, when Spain also beat France.\nLast summer, Tony Parker helped France end Spain\u2019s quest for a third consecutive European title."}
