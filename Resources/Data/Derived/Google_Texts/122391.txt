State DelegateÂ Barbara Comstock, a former aide to retiring Rep. Frank Wolf (R-Va.) Â today announced her campaign to succeed her former boss, who is stepping down after representing Virginia’s 10th District for 17 terms.

“I am running for Congress because I believe my strong recordÂ as a common sense conservative leader is what is needed in Congress. I know how to effectively fight for Northern Virginia’s hard working taxpayers having first learned from Congressman Wolf working in his congressional office,” Comstock said.

“Common sense isn’t very common in Congress today, but in the state legislature, we have to operate within budget limits and produce results. I will bring that skill to Congress,” Comstock continued. Â “I have a demonstrated record of winningÂ important legislative victories for Northern Virginians as well as winningÂ hard fought, principled elections.Â Â Whether it is repealing and replacing Obamacare, promoting policies for a healthier economy; or fighting to protect our national security and dedicated military;Â I will be aÂ tireless advocate for one of the most vibrant and diverse communities in the Commonwealth and I will demand and work hard for common sense results.
