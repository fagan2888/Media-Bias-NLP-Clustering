This tax-free money can be used to cover certain medical expenses.\n\nCome 2018, employers may be less likely to offer that benefit.\n\nThat\u2019s when the high-cost plan tax, or Cadillac tax, a provision of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), kicks in.\n\nThe tax applies to employer-sponsored health plans that exceed $10,200 for a single person or $27,500 for family plans. After 2018, these amounts will increase with inflation.\n\nThe tax will be 40 percent of the difference between the total cost of health benefits for an employee in that year and the threshold amount for that year.\n\nFor big employers, that adds up to big money.\n\nA report from The Kaiser Family Foundation suggests that about 19 percent of employers currently have a plan that would exceed the threshold when FSAs are factored in.\n\nIn future years, as inflation and health insurance premiums rise, more firms are likely to be affected.\n\nLaura T. Kerekes, chief knowledge officer at ThinkHR.com, told Healthline that the tax targets generous employer-provided healthcare plans. She believes it will heavily impact industries where unions have negotiated richer health benefits in lieu of higher wages.\n\nThe only way for employers to avoid the tax is to keep health costs below the threshold. One way to do that is to stop offering FSAs.\n\nRead More: Why Some People Don't Buy Health Insurance \u00bb\n\nHow Flexible Spending Accounts Work\n\nFSAs are only available through an employer. It\u2019s a way for employees to set aside a portion of their compensation for medical expenses.\n\nEmployees decide on the amount and make the deposits, but employers can also contribute. Deposits are capped at $2,550 per year for 2015.\n\nThe money can only be used for qualified medical expenses within the plan year. This includes deductibles and copayments but not insurance premiums.\n\nEmployers don\u2019t have to, but they can choose to allow up to $500 to be carried over into the next year. Alternatively, employers can offer a grace period of up to two and a half months to spend leftover FSA funds. They can\u2019t do both.\n\nThere are some tax advantages for employers, and employees don\u2019t have to pay income tax on the money.\n\nAvoiding the Cadillac Tax\n\nHector De La Torre, executive director of the Transamerica Center for Health Studies, said it\u2019s important to note that the exact formulas for calculating the tax have not yet been released by the IRS.\n\nEven so, employers are already seeking ways to avoid the tax. Not that it\u2019s simple.\n\n\u201cEmployers should review each of their plan offerings and every contribution they make to employee health to determine their exposure. Even if only one of their offerings is over the threshold, the tax will be due,\u201d De La Torre told Healthline.\n\nHe said multistate employers must also consider geographic differences. They need to look at plans in all regions in which they operate.\n\nEmployers should review each of their plan offerings and every contribution they make to employee health to determine their exposure. Hector De La Torre, Transamerica Center for Health Studies\n\nKerekes said it\u2019s likely that all employer-sponsored group health plans will be included, but that stand-alone dental and vision plans would not. Employer and employee contributions to FSAs are also expected to be included.\n\nBesides capping or eliminating FSAs, Kerekes said employers may also consider eliminating health insurance options for premium or higher cost plans.\n\nThey may also use less expensive provider networks, reduce covered services, and increase deductibles and cost sharing.\n\nRead More: The Most Important Aspects of the Affordable Care Act \u00bb\n\nWhat Happens if the Cadillac Tax Is Repealed?\n\nOpponents of the tax are talking repeal, but there\u2019s a lot to consider.\n\n\u201cIf the Cadillac tax is eliminated and the trend continues shifting to employees funding more of the costs of their healthcare, it will remain to be seen if that will actually reduce healthcare costs in the long run,\u201d Kerekes said.\n\n\u201cOur government will also need to determine how to make up for the shortfall with no Cadillac tax revenue to pay for the government-mandated ACA-related expenses,\u201d she added.\n\nMichael Morrisey, Ph.D., is department head and professor of health policy and management at the Texas A&M School of Public Health.\n\nThe argument is that if we have to pay more out of pocket because our insurance hasn\u2019t yet kicked in, we will consume less healthcare. Michael Morrisey, Ph.D., Texas A&M School of Public Health\n\nHe told Healthline that the Cadillac tax is one of the few components of the ACA that is actually likely to lead to reduced healthcare spending.\n\n\u201cThe argument is that if we have to pay more out of pocket because our insurance hasn\u2019t yet kicked in, we will consume less healthcare. Common sense and some pretty good research supports that view,\u201d he said. \u201cThe tax, however, does generate a lot of revenue. One estimate I\u2019ve seen suggests that the tax would generate something like $931 billion in tax revenue between 2020 and 2029.\u201d\n\nMorrisey added, \u201cIt\u2019s numbers like that that make it hard for Congress to find alternative budget savings. Eliminating the Cadillac tax does mean that healthcare costs will rise more rapidly than they otherwise would have.\u201d\n\nMorrisey said the tax would affect the nature of employee compensation.\n\n\u201cExpect firms to eliminate FSAs and increase deductibles,\u201d he said. \u201cSome will increase wages to compensate for these reductions, but employees will have to pay taxes on those higher wages.\u201d\n\nRead More: Comparing Health Insurance Plans \u00bb", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Obamacare, Affordable Care Act, flexible spending accounts, Cadillac tax, Obamacare Cadillac tax, healthcare tax, healthcare tax hurts flexible spending accounts", "og": {"site_name": "Healthline", "description": "The next big test of the Affordable Care Act will be implemented in 2018, but employers are already studying their options for when the so-called \u201cCadillac tax\u201d kicks in.", "title": "Will Obamacare Tax Spell the End of Flexible Spending Accounts?", "url": "http://www.healthline.com/health-news/will-obamacare-tax-spell-the-end-of-flexible-spending-accounts-090915", "image": "http://www.healthline.com/hlcmsresource/images/News/ACA/090815_cadillactax_THUMB.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.healthline.com/hlcmsresource/images/News/ACA/090815_cadillactax_THUMB.jpg", "description": "The next big test of the Affordable Care Act will be implemented in 2018, but employers are already studying their options for when the so-called \u201cCadillac tax\u201d kicks in.", "card": "summary", "title": "Will Obamacare Tax Spell the End of Flexible Spending Accounts?"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP", "DC.date.issued": "2015-09-09", "fb": {"app_id": 239371929577489}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "The next big test of the Affordable Care Act will be implemented in 2018, but employers are already studying their options for when the so-called \u201cCadillac tax\u201d kicks in."}, "article_summary": "That\u2019s when the high-cost plan tax, or Cadillac tax, a provision of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), kicks in.\nRead More: Why Some People Don't Buy Health Insurance \u00bbHow Flexible Spending Accounts WorkFSAs are only available through an employer.\nRead More: The Most Important Aspects of the Affordable Care Act \u00bbWhat Happens if the Cadillac Tax Is Repealed?\nThe tax applies to employer-sponsored health plans that exceed $10,200 for a single person or $27,500 for family plans.\nIn future years, as inflation and health insurance premiums rise, more firms are likely to be affected."}
