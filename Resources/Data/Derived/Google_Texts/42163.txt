Heartland Institute Senior Fellow Benjamin Domenech was a guest on Wednesday night’s “All In with Chris Hayes” on MSNBC. Juding from my Twitter feed, many Hayes fans (who call themseles #inners) are not happy that Ben is a frequent guest. But Hayes picks him because he’s good.

Ben points out that the Tea Party faction, both in Congress and among he people, “never really trusted the Republican establishment or the leadership in the House to actually fight the fight” against Obamacare or stand strong against raising the debt limit. “The reason you got to this point,” Ben continued, “is that you had, essentially, on one side a plan being advocated by Ted Cruz and people of his persuasion, and then you had leadership sort of saying, ‘Well, don’t do that,’ without offering them an alternative.”

Chris Hayes says that the Tea Party faction and right-wing activists are “lying” to the American people and the Republican leadership in Washington. But Ben points out, rightly, that the bigger lie was that Obamacare was ready for prime time. The government shutdown is over. Obamacare will continue to be a disaster for the left.
