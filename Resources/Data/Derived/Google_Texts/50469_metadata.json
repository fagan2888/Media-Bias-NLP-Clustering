After leading churches in Fort Myers and Naples with telecast services, Davis resigned from the pulpit disillusioned and burned out from disappointing experiences, determined never to pastor a church again. What followed was a life completely opposite from the one he had lived before.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t want to be associated with being a preacher,\u201d he said. \u201cI tried to run from this. I ran for two and a half years but when it\u2019s in you nothing else will work for you.\u201d\n\nTwo and a half years later he was living in Tampa when he found himself attending a service at Triumphant Fellowship Church. The pastor of the church recognized him from his previous days in the ministry and invited him to preach, but Davis said that he recalled being full of doubts.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t want to tell him that I had gotten out of church,\u201d he said. \u201cAs dirty and nasty as I had become I thought that God had lifted his anointing from me.\u201d\n\nBut after the first service, his confidence grew until eventually other evangelistic opportunities opened for him in the area.\n\nOn Oct. 20, Davis, 42, of Riverview, was welcomed as the new bishop of Greater Love Christian Center in Plant City. The church is part of Faith Cathedral, a network of churches that Davis founded on the principles of love and acceptance for all.\n\n\u201cI try to make sure that every church I\u2019m associated with is a no condemnation zone,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not our job to change you but to preach and minister to you.\u201d\n\nDavis explained that he was presiding over Greater Love Christian Center as bishop of Faith Cathedral when B. Franklin Echols, founder and bishop over the church, died. Davis served in the interim until he was called to be the church bishop.\n\n\u201cI am still in awe because I never expected to be here. I knew I was loved but I didn\u2019t know I was loved that much and that I would be taking the people of this church to the next level,\u201d Davis said.\n\nBorn in Miami, Davis holds degrees from Moody Bible Institute and the AME Catechism with the African Methodist Episcopal Church and has been a consecrated bishop since 1992 with the Joint College of Bishops. He ministers at Greater Love Christian Center with his wife Sharon Davis, who is also a church overseer. They have two children: Ta\u2019Shara Davis, 2, and Taurus Jr., 8 months.", "article_metadata": {"taboola-pub-time": "Sat, 02 Nov 2013 12:29:00 -0400", "Description": "PLANT CITY \u2013 At first Bishop Taurus Davis believed that he had left the ministry for good.
