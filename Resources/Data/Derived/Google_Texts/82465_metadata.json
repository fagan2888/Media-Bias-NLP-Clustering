That deal was blocked, but the companies\u2019 latest attempt to merge is being reviewed by federal regulators. (Ed Bailey/AP)\n\nThomas Stemberg, whose inability to buy a printer ribbon on a holiday weekend led to the conception of Staples, the office-supply\u00ad superstore he co-founded in 1985, died Oct. 23 at his home in Chestnut Hill, Mass. He was 66.\n\nThe cause was gastric cancer, said a son, Will Stemberg.\n\nMr. Stemberg was a recently dismissed supermarket-chain executive in New England when he conceived the idea for Staples. \u201cOn the Fourth of July weekend in 1985, my printer ribbon ran out, and I couldn\u2019t find a single place to buy a replacement,\u201d he later wrote in an essay for the New York Times. \u201cI envisioned a Toys \u2018R\u2019 Us or Home Depot for office supplies. That\u2019s how Staples was born.\u201d\n\nHe wrote the business plan for Staples. With backing from a former rival in the supermarket business, Leo Kahn, he opened the first store in 1986 in Brighton, Mass.\n\nHe described his business plan as simple: equalizing how much small and large stores paid for the same supplies.\n\n\u201cBack then, if you were a small business, you went to a small stationary store and paid $3.68 for a dozen ballpoint pens,\u201d Mr. Stemberg told the Fairfield County Business Journal. \u201cBut big businesses were paying less than $1 for the same pens.\u201d\n\nThe chain today is the largest U.S. office-supply retailer and has more than 1,600 stores in North America. It had revenue of $22.5 billion in its latest fiscal year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg News.\n\nStaples, based in Framingham, Mass., also spawned competitors, such as Office Max and Office Depot. Staples\u2019s plan to acquire Office Depot, a deal valued at $6.3 billion, is under review by the Federal Trade Commission.\n\nMr. Stemberg served as chief executive until 2002 and chairman until 2005. That year, he joined Highland Consumer Partners, a Wellesley, Mass.-based venture capital firm, where he was managing general partner. The firm focuses on the consumer industry.\n\nHe also was a founder of Olly Shoes, a children\u2019s footwear retailer, and Zoots, a dry cleaner.\n\nThomas George Stemberg, the son of Austrian immigrants, was born in Newark on Jan. 18, 1949. His father was Jewish and his mother was Catholic, and they had fled the Nazis in the late 1930s.\n\nHe was 11 when his father died, and Thomas moved with his mother to her native Vienna, where he attended an American school and became a basketball standout.\n\n1 of 83 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad \u00d7 Notable deaths of 2015 View Photos A look at those who have died this year.

The company then began talks to spin off his division.\n\n\u201cThey were selling the division out from under me, and I got into an argument and was fired,\u201d Mr. Stemberg told the Fairfield County Business Journal. He then went into business with Kahn to start Staples.\n\nOne of the company\u2019s major early backers was Bain Capital, an investment firm co-founded by Mitt Romney. Mr. Stemberg, in turn, became a significant backer of Romney, the former Massachusetts governor who was the Republican presidential nominee in 2012.\n\nRomney often mentioned Staples on the campaign trail as an example of an American success story. Romney also credited Mr. Stemberg with pushing the then-governor to advocate for universal health care in Massachusetts. The law became a model for the federal Affordable Care Act, often called Obamacare.\n\nMr. Stemberg\u2019s marriages to Maureen Sullivan and Dola Hamilton ended in divorce. Survivors include his third wife, Katherine Chapman; six sons; three stepdaughters; and three grandchildren, according to the Boston Globe.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Thomas Stemberg died, Thomas Stemberg obituary, Thomas Stemberg and staples", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Mr. Stemberg launched Staples in 1986 and built it into the country\u2019s largest office-supply retailer.", "title": "Thomas Stemberg, founder of Staples office-supply chain, dies at 66", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/thomas-stemberg-founder-of-staples-office-supply-chain-dies-at-66/2015/10/23/aed8d670-79a3-11e5-a958-d889faf561dc_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2015/10/23/Obituaries/Images/Merlin_44115.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "Thomas Stemberg died, Thomas Stemberg obituary, Thomas Stemberg and staples", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost"}, "eomportal-uuid": "aed8d670-79a3-11e5-a958-d889faf561dc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "description": "Mr. Stemberg launched Staples in 1986 and built it into the country\u2019s largest office-supply retailer."}, "article_summary": "Thomas Stemberg, left, the founder of Staples, with David Fuentes, announcing a 1996 merger with Office Depot.\nMr. Stemberg was a recently dismissed supermarket-chain executive in New England when he conceived the idea for Staples.\nRomney also credited Mr. Stemberg with pushing the then-governor to advocate for universal health care in Massachusetts.\nMr. Stemberg, in turn, became a significant backer of Romney, the former Massachusetts governor who was the Republican presidential nominee in 2012.\nMr. Stemberg returned to the United States to attend Harvard University, earning a bachelor\u2019s degree in 1971."}
