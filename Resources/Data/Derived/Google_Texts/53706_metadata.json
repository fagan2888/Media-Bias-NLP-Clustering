We know that U.S. 59 is being converted to Interstate 69, but we really don\u2019t want all that traffic coming right through the middle. There needs to be a bypass and there needs to go south and east,\u201d said the county judge.\n\nEmmett also noted the I-69 bypass would be an important component to handle traffic from the Port of Houston, as well as from ports in Galveston and Freeport.\n\nHarris County Commissioner Jack Cagle, who represents Precinct 4, agreed that transportation is one of the main issues that must be dealt with.\n\n\u201cHe is spot on with regard to that,\u201d said Cagle. \u201cThat\u2019s one of the reasons why in our last bond election the voters approved 74 percent that they were wanting us to invest more in that area,\u201d the commissioner added.\n\nIn a press conference held after his speech, Emmett called for Texas to expand Medicaid using federal funding provided through the Affordable Care Act as the most viable way to do it.\n\nThe county judge had opinions on how Texas legislators criticize Medicaid expansion.\n\n\u201cThe same people who wanna lower property taxes, also don\u2019t wanna take that federal money. Well, the easiest way to lower property taxes is to take the federal dollars,\u201d Emmett underlined.\n\nThe future of the Astrodome was a topic that Emmett referred to as one of Harris County\u2019s additional challenges and he hinted the local landmark could be used in 2017 when Houston hosts the Super Bowl.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019ve seen any of the spectacular light shows that have been done on the sides of buildings, like when Rice had its Centennial, the same kind of thing can be done with the Dome,\u201d Emmett explained.\n\nThe County Judge added he supports building a parking lot under the Astrodome, which is an option the Harris County Commissioners Court will review this year.", "article_metadata": {"category": "News", "description": "He also called for Texas to expand Medicaid using federal funds as the most viable way.", "programs": "none", "og": {"site_name": "Houston Public Media", "description": "He also called for Texas to expand Medicaid using federal funds as the most viable way.", "title": "Judge Emmett Focuses His State Of The County Address On Transportation And The Astrodome | Houston Public Media", "url": "https://www.houstonpublicmedia.org/articles/news/2016/02/03/136538/judge-emmett-focuses-his-state-of-the-county-address-on-transportation-and-the-astrodome/", "image": {"secure_url": "https://www.houstonpublicmedia.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/02194756/Photo-for-story-on-the-State-of-the-County-Address-02-02-2016-1200x800.jpg", "url": "https://www.houstonpublicmedia.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/02194756/Photo-for-story-on-the-State-of-the-County-Address-02-02-2016-1200x800.jpg", "height": 800, "width": 1200, "identifier": "https://www.houstonpublicmedia.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/02194756/Photo-for-story-on-the-State-of-the-County-Address-02-02-2016-1200x800.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg"}, "type": "article"}, "story_id": 465398727, "twitter": {"description": "He also called for Texas to expand Medicaid using federal funds as the most viable way.", "title": "Judge Emmett Focuses His State Of The County Address On Transportation And The Astrodome", "url": "https://www.houstonpublicmedia.org/articles/news/2016/02/03/136538/judge-emmett-focuses-his-state-of-the-county-address-on-transportation-and-the-astrodome/", "image": "https://www.houstonpublicmedia.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/02194756/Photo-for-story-on-the-State-of-the-County-Address-02-02-2016-1200x800.jpg", "creator": "@houstonpubmedia", "site": "@houstonpubmedia", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Al Ortiz", "wordCount": 428, "org_id": 220, "datePublished": "2016-02-03T06:56:39+00:00", "fb": {"admins": 37511993, "app_id": 1520489194943572, "pages": 27589213702}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "article": {"section": "News", "tag": "transportation", "published_time": "2016-02-03T06:56:39+00:00"}, "keywords": "News, Affordable Care Act, astrodome, ed emmett, harris county, i 69, Jack Cagle, medicaid, transportation", "google-site-verification": "QOrBnMZ1LXDA9tL3e5WmFUU-oI3JUbDRotOWST1P_Dg", "has_audio": 1, "bitly-verification": "7777946f1a0a"}, "article_summary": "/ DownloadAl Ortiz | Houston Public MediaHarris County Judge Ed Emmett delivered his ninth State of the County address on Tuesday at NRG Center and spoke about the county\u2019s accomplishments and challenges.\nThe County Judge added he supports building a parking lot under the Astrodome, which is an option the Harris County Commissioners Court will review this year.\nThere needs to be a bypass and there needs to go south and east,\u201d said the county judge.\nAs he addressed the city\u2019s heavy traffic, Emmett singled out an option he thinks is essential.\nHe also called for Texas to expand Medicaid using federal funds as the most viable way."}
