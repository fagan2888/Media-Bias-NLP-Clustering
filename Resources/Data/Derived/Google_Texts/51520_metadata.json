They can know the plays all day, but as long as you\u2019re going out there and you\u2019re cutting hard and you\u2019re doing all the things to make the play work it still should be effective.\u201d\n\nDenver\u2019s starting five struggled all game. They made only 11-of-49 shots (22 percent) from the field.\n\n\u201cIt was a challenge,\u201d said Arthur, a starter who was held to 2-of-13 shooting. \u201cThey switched a lot. We\u2019ve got to work on our switch offense a little bit more and try to exploit that.\u201d\n\nMudiay\u2019s misery. Point guard Emmanuel Mudiay finished with 2-of-15 shooting in 23 minutes. His four points were his fewest in a March game. He scored four points against Dallas on Feb. 26.\n\nThe Clippers went under screens, forcing Mudiay to shoot. And the rookie was cold.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d say most of the shots he took he was wide open,\u201d said coach Michael Malone. \u201cThey guarded him the same way the last time we played them, and that\u2019s what Emmanuel is going to have to continue to work on.\n\n\u201cIf teams are going to continue to go under and dare him into taking those shots, he has to step into them and make them pay.\u201d\n\nMudiay went into Sunday\u2019s game averaging 12.3 points.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Los Angeles Clippers read Nuggets\u2019 offense like an open book", "title": "Los Angeles Clippers read Nuggets\u2019 offense like an open book", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/03/27/los-angeles-clippers-read-nuggets-offense-like-an-open-book/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160327__DeAndre-Jordanp1.jpg", "height": 421}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160327__DeAndre-Jordanp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2016-03-27T19:24:47+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-15T05:43:42+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "LOS ANGELES \u2014 The Nuggets missed 12 of their first 16 shots Sunday against the Clippers, who knew exactly what was coming offensively.\nClippers center DeAndre Jordan was calling out Denver\u2019s plays to get his team\u2019s defense set as the Nuggets were running them.\nNuggets Mailbag: Pose a question for Christopher DempseyArthur added that the Nuggets should have been able to execute regardless.\nWe\u2019ve got to work on our switch offense a little bit more and try to exploit that.\u201dMudiay\u2019s misery.\n\u201cI\u2019d say most of the shots he took he was wide open,\u201d said coach Michael Malone."}
