But when she and her husband decided to try in vitro fertilization, the price was far higher than she ever expected, and it seemed as though having a family would be out of her reach.\n\n\u201cIVF is expensive, and for that type of procedure they won\u2019t let you make payments,\u201d Anderson says. \u201cIt costs nearly $20,000 and they want their money upfront, before the procedure begins.\u201d\n\n[Read: Egg Freezing: A New Frontier in Fertility.]\n\nThen one day when she was browsing Facebook, Anderson came across a link to the crowdfunding site GoFundMe, where people could ask for money from friends, family and strangers to help fund anything from medical bills and college tuition to vacations and weddings. \u201cI thought about it, but because I\u2019ve never gone public with the fact that I couldn\u2019t have children, I was nervous,\u201d she says. \u201cAs a woman, it\u2019s a hard thing to tell people.\u201d\n\nBut after speaking with her husband, they decided to create a crowdfunding campaign titled the Anderson Baby Fund. \u201cI created the page and sat on it for a month before I decided to launch it,\u201d Anderson says. \u201cI figured that if we were going into debt to have a family, we could use all the help we can get.\u201d\n\n[Read: How to Deal With the Stress of Debt.]\n\nAnderson is one of thousands of people who use websites such as GoFundMe or\u200b Indiegogo\u200b\u200b to raise money for medical treatment \u2013 and it\u2019s no wonder why. A 2013 analysis by the personal finance website NerdWallet found that 1.7 million Americans live in households that will declare bankruptcy due to medical bills, and 10 million insured\u200b Americans ages 19 to 64 \u200bface bills they are unable to pay. Part of that reason stems from high deductibles as a result of the Affordable Care Act, says Debra Lowe\u200b, administrative director of The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center\u2019s revenue cycle. \u200b\u201cPeople who have historically had insurance weren\u2019t used to having a high out-of-pocket expense,\u201d Lowe says. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing people with $5,000 or $10,000 deductibles, which we really hadn\u2019t before.\u201d\n\n[See: Infographic: How to Read Your Hospital Bill.]\n\nWhile high medical bills\u200b are a major part of the problem, Americans' inability to save further compounds it. A 2011 study by the National Bureau of Economic Research found that a quarter of Americans could not come up with $2,000 in 30 days in the case of an emergency, and 19 percent would only be able to do by selling or pawning possessions. \u201cIt\u2019s no surprise that more and more people are turning to crowdfunding,\u201d Lowe says.\n\nOne campaign titled \u201cJuan Carlos family needs you!\u201d has raised more than $125,000 in the past five days to help pay for the medical bills of a cyclist who was hit by a car in California. However, how successful your campaign is depends on how good you are at getting the word out, Lowe says. \u201cIf you have friends who are willing to contribute, it can be great,\u201d she says.\n\nAnderson shares her page on Facebook and Twitter frequently to try and solicit donations, but is worried she's just clogging up her friends\u2019 feeds. \u201cI don\u2019t want to annoy people with my problem,\u201d she says.\n\nSince starting her campaign in February, Anderson has raised more than $5,000 from 47 donations, the largest of which have been two separate donations of $1,000. \u201cIt makes me feel blessed that people are willing to give,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen someone who doesn\u2019t know me is willing to give to help us accomplish something that just often happens to other people by accident, the feeling is overwhelming.\u201d\n\nAnderson can withdraw money at any time, which she's found beneficial as she and her husband began the fertility process. \u201cWe had to do a trial run to see if we were a candidate for IVF, and we\u2019re already in $3,000 just from that,\u201d she says.\n\n[Read: Socked With an Out-of-Network Medical Bill?]\n\n\n\nSo what should you do if you want to start a crowdfunding campaign of your own? Start with a heartfelt, personal story, says Lexi Georgiadis\u200b, a representative with IndieGogo. \"Making the campaign really personal is key, especially for medical bills,\" she says. \"You want to give people something they can connect with.\"\n\nNext, prepare to put in a lot of work, says Kelsea Little,\u200b a customer happiness agent with GoFundMe. \u200b\"The more effort you put into your GoFundMe campaign, the more you will get out of it,\" she says. \"A successful campaign takes frequent sharing on social media, and asking others to share as well.\"\n\nFinally, be sure to update your contributors on your progress. \"If you\u2019re proactive about the campaign, post updates regularly and write to the people who contributed \u2013 that helps encourage people to share it,\" Georgiadis says.\n\nHowever, raising money using GoFundMe or Indiegogo isn\u2019t free. GoFundMe takes a total of\u200b 7.9 percent plus 30 cents from each donation as a fee, while Indiegogo charges either a 4 percent or 9 percent fee, depending on the type of campaign you choose.\n\nAnderson needs another $13,000 to begin her IVF procedure, but is confident she\u2019ll reach her goal. \u201cWe\u2019re excited at the idea of being parents,\u201d she says. \u201cAll the people who have helped us and continue to help us will know they played a role in helping give us a family.\u201d\n\n", "article_metadata": {"usn-stitial-fact": "{\"slug\":\"160202\",\"text\":\"Heart disease affects people of all ages.\"}", "usn-comments-mode": "facebook", "description": "One couple can't afford fertility treatments, so they're turning to others for help starting a family.", "zone": "healthandwellness/articles", "author": "Amir Khan", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "One couple can't afford fertility treatments, so they're turning to others for help starting a family.", "title": "Crowdfunding Your Medical Bills", "url": "http://health.usnews.com/health-news/health-wellness/articles/2014/08/21/crowdfunding-your-medical-bills", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/e0/aa9f2c0a5d94db8fbb48b419a7d82f/52337WideModern_laptoptyping_012314.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "One couple can't afford fertility treatments, so they're turning to others for help starting a family.", "site": "@USNews", "card": "summary", "title": "Crowdfunding Your Medical Bills - US News"}, "usn-platform-id": "a", "site": "health-news", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "published_at": "2014-08-21", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/dims4/USNEWS/02c57dc/2147483647/thumbnail/80x80/quality/85/?url=%2Fcmsmedia%2Fe0%2Faa9f2c0a5d94db8fbb48b419a7d82f%2Fresizes%2F500%2F52337WideModern_laptoptyping_012314.jpg", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "keywords": "LTHealth [Consumer Advice],health-tech [Consumer Advice],pregnancy,healthwellness [Consumer Advice],personal finance,infertility,Amir Khan", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/usnewsandworldreport", "published_time": "2014-08-21"}, "usn-content-type": "article", "social_id": "http://t.usnews.com/Z2t4wi", "viewport": "width=980", "news_keywords": "IVF, crowdfunding, medical bills, gofundme, donation, facebook, Affordable Care Act"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda80e\"", "article_summary": "While high medical bills\u200b are a major part of the problem, Americans' inability to save further compounds it.\nA 2013 analysis by the personal finance website NerdWallet found that 1.7 million Americans live in households that will declare bankruptcy due to medical bills, and 10 million insured\u200b Americans ages 19 to 64 \u200bface bills they are unable to pay.\n\"Making the campaign really personal is key, especially for medical bills,\" she says.\n\u200b\"The more effort you put into your GoFundMe campaign, the more you will get out of it,\" she says.\nThen one day when she was browsing Facebook, Anderson came across a link to the crowdfunding site GoFundMe, where people could ask for money from friends, family and strangers to help fund anything from medical bills and college tuition to vacations and weddings."}
