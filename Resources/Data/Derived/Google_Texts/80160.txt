If you're counting on your home state to save Obamacare subsidies for residents—and their individual insurance markets—you might be in for quite a long wait.

A pending Supreme Court decision might end often-generous financial aid to 6.4 million Obamacare customers in 34 states as early as July. But experts say most of those states will be unwilling politically or unable logistically—or perhaps both—to take steps that could quickly restore that money.

And it's not clear that even the handful of states like Pennsylvania and Delaware that have taken such steps to protect those subsidies will be able to complete that effort fast enough to be in effect for 2016 open enrollment this fall.

"The odds that the states, that any one of the states, can fix this is very small," said Robert Laszewski, president of Health Policy and Strategy Associates consulting firm. "They have to start enrollment on Oct. 1. They're not going to be ready in three months."

"You're looking at at least a year," Laszewski said.
