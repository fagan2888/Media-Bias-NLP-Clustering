It\u2019s likely some people submitted more than one application out of frustration with the slow process and that many aren\u2019t eligible for expansion, as Virginia hasn\u2019t chosen to expand coverage, Simmonds said.\n\n\n\n\u201cGoing forward, we continue to make system enhancements that we believe will maximize opportunities for applicants to have self-directed eligibility determinations \u2014 an eligibility determination that can be accomplished without a human touch using the federal hub data to determine eligibility,\u201d Simmonds said via email. \u201cWe believe that this is critical as we move forward to cover the health insurance gap.\u201d\n\nStill, it\u2019s a backlog that gives some weight to the fears of Republicans who say Medicaid expansion, which would add anywhere from 200,000 to 400,000 people to a program with about 1 million enrollees currently, would overwhelm the system.\n\nWith a Saturday budget deadline looming, Richmond is at a standstill.\n\nThe Senate proposed its own version of Medicaid expansion, but the House shot it down. House Republicans proposed expanding the session by 30 days to work out a deal, but Senate Democrats killed it. That leaves mere hours for Republicans and Democrats to reach a compromise, or end the session without a biennial budget and return later.\n\nMedicaid applications ultimately are processed in each of Virginia\u2019s more than 100 Department of Social Services offices.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that if they were to expand, we would need additional help,\u201d said Joanna Spar, benefits programs supervisor at the Roanoke County Department of Social Services.\n\nExpansion or not, that workload probably will increase when the backlogged applications from Healthcare.gov trickle down from the state, she said.\n\n\u201cThe applications and cases have increased a little bit because what we\u2019re finding with the new health care reform and what the government is imposing for those that don\u2019t have health benefits, we\u2019ve had an influx of those who have applied,\u201d said Spar, even if applicants don\u2019t ultimately qualify for coverage.\n\nThere\u2019s a difference between the number of applications and actual cases. Applications are simply the number of people who apply for Medicaid, while cases represent Medicaid enrollees.\n\nIn Spotsylvania County, expansion could mean another 3,000 to 5,000 eligible people \u2014 and probably even more than those who would apply in hopes of being eligible, said Gail Crooks, director of the Spotsylvania Department of Social Services. Crooks said her office is always looking to be more efficient, but expansion would demand more hands on deck.\n\n\u201cWould we need help if they went to Medicaid expansion? I believe we would,\u201d Crooks said.\n\nShe has added two benefit eligibility workers to her budget request.\n\n\u201cThe primary reason for the request was while we could certainly put them to use right now, they were primarily tied to the possibility of Medicaid expansion,\u201d Crooks said.\n\nBut in Spotsylvania, recent applications and enrollment haven\u2019t necessarily spiked with the health-coverage requirement under the Affordable Care Act. Rather, her office experienced massive increases during a population boom in the early 1990s and early 2000s, and after the Great Recession hit in 2008.\n\n\u201cWe as a locality have been experiencing increases in caseload for quite a while,\u201d Crooks said.\n\nTerry Rephann, a regional economist with the University of Virginia\u2019s Weldon Cooper Center for Public Service, has researched the labor impacts of expansion on various areas of Virginia\u2019s economy. While he hasn\u2019t researched the specifics for local Departments of Social Services, he said expansion would require more people to handle applications and cases.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re just talking about people who do the paperwork, I would imagine it would have to increase because you have a lot more people who are going to be eligible,\u201d Rephann said. \u201cBut how much they\u2019re going to have to increase the budget to accommodate, that I don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nKathryn Watson is an investigative reporter for Watchdog.org, and can be reached at kwatson@watchdog.org.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Virginia has a Medicaid backlog, fueling fears that the commonwealth may not be ready to expand the program yet.", "title": "Medicaid applications from Healthcare.gov overloading VA system  - Watchdog.org", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2013/02/nova-traffic.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-03-07T08:59:28+00:00", "url": "http://watchdog.org/131517/medicaid-backlog-expansion/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Watchdogorg", "section": "News", "tag": "backlog,expansion,Government,House of Delegates,medicaid,Republicans,Richmond,Senate,Terry McAuliffe", "published_time": "2014-03-07T08:58:56+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-03-07T08:59:28+00:00"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Virginia has a Medicaid backlog, fueling fears that the commonwealth may not be ready to expand the program yet.", "title": "Medicaid applications from Healthcare.gov overloading VA system  - Watchdog.org", "image": {"src": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2013/02/nova-traffic.jpg"}, "creator": "@watchdogorg", "site": "@watchdogorg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive", "description": "Virginia has a Medicaid backlog, fueling fears that the commonwealth may not be ready to expand the program yet."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce1db\"", "article_summary": "Medicaid applications ultimately are processed in each of Virginia\u2019s more than 100 Department of Social Services offices.\nThe Department of Social Services has hired temporary staff, and some DSS employees are working nights and weekends, said Necole Simmonds, director of public affairs for the Department of Social Services.\nThe Senate proposed its own version of Medicaid expansion, but the House shot it down.\nBy Kathryn Watson | Watchdog.org, Virginia BureauALEXANDRIA, Va. \u2014 With Medicaid expansion in limbo, the Virginia Department of Social Services already is backlogged and working overtime to handle the 50,000 applications directed to the state from Healthcare.gov.\n\u201cThe primary reason for the request was while we could certainly put them to use right now, they were primarily tied to the possibility of Medicaid expansion,\u201d Crooks said."}
