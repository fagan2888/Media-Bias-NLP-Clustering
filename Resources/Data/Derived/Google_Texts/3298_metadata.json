In a no-refusal checkpoint, a driver who refuses a sobriety test \u2014 either a breath test or a standard field sobriety test \u2014 could be compelled to undergo a blood test.\n\nA judge is either on site or on call to rule on probable cause and can issue a warrant for the test. A certified phlebotomist is at the ready, and blood is drawn at the checkpoint.\n\nAccording to state law, drivers in Mississippi give their \u201cimplied consent\u201d to a blood or breath sample if an officer lawfully requests it. A search warrant becomes necessary if a driver refuses, and a first-time refusal results in a 90-day license suspension.\n\nIs this constitutional? The Mississippi Highway Safety Patrol did not return repeated requests for comment.\n\nBut Ronald Wright, a law professor and the associate dean for academic affairs at Wake Forest University in Winston-Salem, N.C., said the tactic is not in keeping with the spirit of the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and its prohibition against unreasonable search and seizures.\n\n\u201cState statutes might give the police certain authority in a traffic setting that they wouldn\u2019t have in other settings,\u201d Wright said. \u201cOne thing that worries me is typically a warrant is based on probable cause. Probable cause, in normal doctrine, cannot be based on refusal to cooperate. We\u2019re allowed to be uncooperative, and police are not supposed to draw any inferences from that.\n\n\u201cTo the extent that a judge is issuing a normal warrant and then they\u2019re using the fact someone says no as evidence, I think that\u2019s contrary to traditional Fourth Amendment practice.\u201d\n\nJohn Bowman, communications director for the National Motorists Association, said the 30 states that perform these checkpoints, are violating drivers\u2019 rights.\n\n\u201cBackers of no-refusal point out that the police secure warrants before the invasive testing, but often the justification for the warrant is flimsy at best,\u201d Bowman said. \u201cAnd remember, we\u2019re not talking about breath tests here. We\u2019re talking about taking a person\u2019s blood, sometimes against their will. This has the potential to become a gross violation of personal privacy.\u201d\n\nOriginally appeared on Watchdog.org.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Refuse a DUI Checkpoint, and You May Be Subject to a Blood Test.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Refuse a DUI Checkpoint, and You May Be Subject to a Blood Test.", "title": "Blood Testing Could Be in Store for Mississippi Drivers at DUI Checkpoints", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/4446135487_ca2bedaffd_o.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-09-15T17:40:18+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1qXrvaw"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Refuse a DUI Checkpoint, and You May Be Subject to a Blood Test.", "creator": "@dailysignal", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/4446135487_ca2bedaffd_o.jpg"}, "title": "Blood Testing Could Be in Store for Mississippi Drivers at DUI Checkpoints", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Law", "tag": "constitution", "published_time": "2014-09-16T03:01:22+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-09-15T17:40:18+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "DUI Checkpoint, laws for dui checkpoints, mississippi dui checkpoint, dui blood test, mississippi highway safety patrol"}, "article_summary": "Over Labor Day weekend, the Mississippi Highway Safety Patrol ran a no-refusal DUI checkpoint in Oxford, home of the University of Mississippi.\nIn a no-refusal checkpoint, a driver who refuses a sobriety test \u2014 either a breath test or a standard field sobriety test \u2014 could be compelled to undergo a blood test.\nAccording to state law, drivers in Mississippi give their \u201cimplied consent\u201d to a blood or breath sample if an officer lawfully requests it.\nA judge is either on site or on call to rule on probable cause and can issue a warrant for the test.\nProbable cause, in normal doctrine, cannot be based on refusal to cooperate."}
