Authorities identified the driver who was killed as Siara Jaramillo of Longmont.\n\nThornton residents Francisco Garcia, 32, and Andres Garcia, 26, received minor injuries.\n\nAfter the initial crash, a 2006 Freightliner truck driven by Obdulio Ramos, 37, of Westminster and a 2006 Ford Escape driven by William Rivas, 37, of Hudson, struck the first two vehicles.\n\nRamos and Rivas were not injured.\n\nState troopers closed all three northbound lanes of the highway in Broomfield to investigate what triggered the 6:21 a.m. collision near Colorado 7, Trooper Josh Lewis said.\n\nOne lane was reopened at about 9:20 a.m., and the other two lanes opened about 10 a.m.\n\nJaramillo was driving a silver 2007 Kia Rio south on the northbound side of I-25 when it slammed head-on into a blue 1994 Toyota pickup truck driven by Francisco Garcia, said State Partol Sgt. Rob Madden.\n\n\u201cTo go head-on on the highway, someone had to have been going the wrong way,\u201d Madden said.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear whether the woman crossed the median or entered the highway from on off-ramp, he said.\n\nTroopers have questioned several witnesses.\n\nThe injured men were taken to Good Samaritan Medical Center for treatment.\n\nKirk Mitchell: 303-954-1206, denverpost.com/coldcases or twitter.com/kirkmitchell", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Broomfield crash kills one and closes NB I-25 for hours", "title": "Broomfield crash kills one and closes NB I-25 for hours", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/07/25/broomfield-crash-kills-one-and-closes-nb-i-25-for-hours/", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150725__crashp1.jpg", "height": 457}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150725__crashp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-07-25T08:04:16+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-22T14:25:03+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe3cf5\"", "article_summary": "State troopers closed all three northbound lanes of the highway in Broomfield to investigate what triggered the 6:21 a.m. collision near Colorado 7, Trooper Josh Lewis said.\nAfter the initial crash, a 2006 Freightliner truck driven by Obdulio Ramos, 37, of Westminster and a 2006 Ford Escape driven by William Rivas, 37, of Hudson, struck the first two vehicles.\nState troopers are investigating whether drugs or alcohol contributed to the crash.\n\u201cTo go head-on on the highway, someone had to have been going the wrong way,\u201d Madden said.\nIt\u2019s unclear whether the woman crossed the median or entered the highway from on off-ramp, he said."}
