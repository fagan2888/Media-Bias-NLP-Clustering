But while the health industry and huge majorities in Congress are praising this bipartisan effort, the American people should ask for a refund.\n\nCreated in 1997, the Sustainable Growth Rate (SGR) formula was designed in such a way that if Medicare\u2019s costs grew too much, automatic cuts to Medicare doctor payments would take place. The costs have risen exponentially. However, Congress has continuously overridden this law since 2003, creating a so-called \u201cDoc Fix\u201d nearly 20 times in the last 12 years.\n\nThis year, House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) worked with House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-California) to create bipartisan legislation that would take this annual legislative headache off the table forever.\n\nThe bill, known as H.R. 2, overwhelmingly passed the House, and last week did so in the Senate, then became law with President Obama\u2019s signature. It offsets the cost of eliminating the payment cuts\u2014again, set in place to reduce spending\u2014with small levels of means-testing, changes to the Medicare payment system that, at least in theory, encourage quality of care instead of quantity of care, and other changes to various health care incentives.\n\nH.R. 2 also extended a number of federal health care programs, including the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program (CHIP). All told, it is estimated to save $35 billion in the first decade, and $235 billion in the second decade, compared to projected deficits.\n\nPushing Yet Another Debt Problem Onto American Kids As a whole, H.R. 2 has some worthwhile, if small, steps towards real entitlement reform. Changing payment incentives to prevent overutilization will, in theory, lead to more effective use of resources and a higher-quality experience for patients, and means-testing is a no-brainer in intellectually honest policy circles.\n\nIf payment cuts are permanently ended, today\u2019s politicians will have successfully pushed yet another debt problem onto tomorrow\u2019s elected officials and citizens. But these small successes are not enough to stop the bait-and-switch from Congress as it eliminates the threat of payment cuts, which was the main driver behind creating H.R. 2. If payment cuts are permanently ended, today\u2019s politicians will have successfully pushed yet another debt problem onto tomorrow\u2019s elected officials and citizens.\n\nThe first problem with the SGR portion of H.R. 2 is the argument that it is health-care reform. That premise, popular among supporters of H.R. 2, continues the myth that getting rid of payment cuts reforms Medicare for the better.\n\nWhile payment reductions to doctors are certainly an imperfect method of controlling costs\u2014although such rationing tactics are standard in Britain and other nations, as well as the Affordable Care Act and, clearly, the 1990s Medicare system\u2014eliminating them without substantive Medicare reform is a path to fiscal failure.\n\nThe Cato Institute\u2019s Michael Cannon may have said it best. \u201cIf this bill passes, it will be easier for Congress to ignore runaway Medicare spending \u2014 and that spending will begin to run away even faster,\u201d he says. \u201cReformers might be better off leaving the SGR in place and preserving the leverage it creates until political realities have changed \u2014 that is, until there is a president who will support broader Medicare reform.\u201d\n\nAgain, stopping payment cuts to doctors is not reforming Medicare. It\u2019s merely throwing a rhetorical and legislative shield at what the cuts are designed to do: slow Medicare\u2019s enormous cost growth.\n\nPromised Reforms Never Materialize The second problem with the proposed SGR changes is the reliance on promises, such as the one House Speaker John Boehner (R-OH) made in a piece at National Review Online. According to Boehner, H.R. 2 \u201cwill\u2026set the stage for further reforms in the future to help seniors and taxpayers.\u201d A spokesman for Boehner, Michael Steel, reiterated this to me, stating that \u201cthis agreement is not the silver bullet that will save Medicare, but it is a good, responsible first step\u2014and the only way we are likely to make any progress with President Obama in the White House.\u201d\n\nLast year Boehner told voters that if Republicans were given control of Congress, he would lead the GOP against Obama\u2019s proposed amnesty by using Congress\u2019 control of the purse. However, Boehner\u2019s record on holding to promises is suspect, to say the least. In 2010, the then-minority leader said he would cut $100 billion from the federal budget in 2011. That number was dropped to just over $60 billion shortly after Boehner took the speaker\u2019s gavel from Pelosi, and in the end he managed to eliminate a mere $38 billion, taking only $352 million out of the 2011 budget.\n\nLikewise, last year Boehner told voters that if Republicans were given control of Congress, he would lead the GOP against Obama\u2019s proposed amnesty by using Congress\u2019 control of the purse. As we now know, the speaker negotiated his way to another loss against Obama.\n\nThe Law Changes Little About Medicare\u2019s Debt Explosion A third flaw with the SGR portion of H.R. 2 is a political argument from its supporters, perhaps most eloquently Americans for Tax Reform\u2019s Ryan Ellis. According to Ellis, Congress must work with the political realities it is given, so he supports H.R. 2 as it stands. This might make sense, if the SGR component of H.R. 2 was actually about entitlement reform instead of another opportunity for Congress to push the issue of solving Medicare down the road.\n\nOnce again, Republicans in Congress failed to make gains against the federal behemoth\u2019s continuous, unsustainable growth. As is typical, supporters of H.R. 2 are making the political reality argument rather than admit that, once again, Republicans in Congress failed to make gains against the federal behemoth\u2019s continuous, unsustainable growth. This failure is taking place despite GOP control of Congress\u2019 purse, and the many opportunities for political leverage that have passed Boehner by since 2011.\n\nAccording to Steel, Republicans \u201ccertainly understand the need to save Medicare for future generations, which is why the House has passed a series of balanced, fiscally-responsible budgets that address the issue.\u201d However, those \u201cfiscally-responsible budgets\u201d do not implement Medicare reform for a full decade, which is just five years before Medicare\u2019s main trust fund is expected to be exhausted, and fail to touch Social Security.\n\nAs with any proposal, fiscal concerns should be a top priority. The Congressional Budget Office projects that H.R. 2 will save $35 billion over the first decade, and Boehner\u2019s op-ed notes an estimated $235 billion in savings for the second decade of reform. However, such savings are not due to the SGR part of H.R., but rather the means-testing and payment reforms it includes.\n\nBut these projected savings are tiny compared to a program that spent nearly $500 billion in 2013 alone, and is expected to grow dramatically over the next 20 years. Without major changes to Medicare, tax increases, drastic cuts, or both will be necessary\u2014and some of those tax increases will hit people who don\u2019t even use Medicare.", "article_metadata": {"item-publish-date": "Mon, 20 Apr 2015 07:37:37 EDT", "og": {"site_name": "The Federalist", "description": "A new law eliminating Medicare\u2019s annual 'doc fix' makes tiny cuts at the expense of ignoring the calamity Medicare means for America\u2019s finances.", "title": "Ditch The Permanent \u2018Doc Fix\u2019 For Real Entitlement Reform", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://thefederalist.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/6104068209_d134b246f5_b.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-04-20T10:04:51+00:00", "url": "http://thefederalist.com/2015/04/20/ditch-the-permanent-doc-fix-for-real-entitlement-reform/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Federalist", "description": "A new law eliminating Medicare\u2019s annual 'doc fix' makes tiny cuts at the expense of ignoring the calamity Medicare means for America\u2019s finances.", "title": "Ditch The Permanent \u2018Doc Fix\u2019 For Real Entitlement Reform", "image": {"src": "http://thefederalist.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/6104068209_d134b246f5_b.jpg"}, "creator": "@FDRLST", "site": "@FDRLST", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article": {"section": "Health Care", "tag": "doc fix,Entitlement Reform,Entitlements,John Boehner,Medicare,Sustainable Growth Rate", "published_time": "2015-04-20T07:37:37+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-04-20T10:04:51+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "A new law eliminating Medicare\u2019s annual 'doc fix' makes tiny cuts at the expense of ignoring the calamity Medicare means for America\u2019s finances."}, "article_summary": "Last week, the so-called \u201cDoc Fix\u201d\u2014Congress\u2019 annual tradition of delaying scheduled payment cuts to Medicare doctors\u2014became a thing of the past.\nIf payment cuts are permanently ended, today\u2019s politicians will have successfully pushed yet another debt problem onto tomorrow\u2019s elected officials and citizens.\n2, continues the myth that getting rid of payment cuts reforms Medicare for the better.\nAccording to Boehner, H.R.\nHowever, Congress has continuously overridden this law since 2003, creating a so-called \u201cDoc Fix\u201d nearly 20 times in the last 12 years."}
