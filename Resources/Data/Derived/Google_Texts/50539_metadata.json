Seeks Medical Marijuana Dispensaries For 7 Counties", "article_keywords": ["taloumis", "dispensaries", "dispensary", "process", "medical", "marijuana", "think", "applications", "mass", "counties", "open", "company", "seeks"], "article_url": "http://www.wbur.org/2014/07/09/mass-seeks-medical-marijuana-dispensaries-for-7-counties", "article_text": "The state Department of Public Health has officially begun the process to approve medical marijuana dispensaries in seven counties that so far do not have any in the planning stage.\n\nThe seven counties considered \u201copen\u201d for dispensaries are Suffolk, Bristol, Hampden, Berkshire, Franklin, Dukes and Nantucket. Applicants who had previously applied to open dispensaries in those counties were ultimately rejected.\n\nFour dispensary teams invited to apply will have to submit their applications between August 1 and August 29.\n\nChristopher Taloumis of JCS Holdings, Inc. originally wanted to open a registered marijuana dispensary, or RMD, in Dennis. But another team was approved to move forward with a dispensary there. So Taloumis is looking elsewhere and has narrowed down the possibilities to a few locations.\n\nHe says he\u2019s glad DPH is stressing good geographic distribution of the facilities.\n\n\u201cA lot of these people that are going to the RMDs are sick,\u201d Taloumis said. \u201cIt\u2019s very unpleasant for them to have to get in the car and drive a long distance. So I think the more RMDs there are, closer to patients, providing better access is what it\u2019s all about.\u201d\n\nDPH is using mapping software to distribute the facilities according to factors including highway access and rates of HIV and cancer \u2014 diseases considered qualifying conditions for medical marijuana.\n\nThe organization Coastal Compassion originally applied to open a dispensary in New Bedford, but another group was selected to proceed with a dispensary in Bristol County \u2014 in Fairhaven. That company, Brighton Health Advocates, was ultimately disqualified.\n\nWith Bristol County now open for a dispensary again, Keogh says his company will look in several South Shore communities in order to identify an appropriate location and secure support from local leaders. The company may seek to open its marijuana cultivation facility in New Bedford, with the dispensary elsewhere in the county.\n\nAsked whether the application process has been more difficult than expected, Keogh calls it a challenge.\n\n\u201cAs with any kind of emerging industry, there\u2019s no road map,\u201d he said. \u201cI think to our benefit, we were able to manage our expectations and roll with the changes.\u201d\n\nTaloumis says the process hasn\u2019t been as cut and dry as he expected.\n\n\u201c[The Department of Public Health], I think, is doing the best it can in new territory,\u201d Taloumis said. \u201cBut I can honestly say I\u2019ve never had more sleepless nights in my life.\u201d\n\nDPH faced widespread criticism for not thoroughly vetting applicants before provisionally approving 20 planned dispensaries in January. After revelations of false or misleading claims on applications, and accusations of political favoritism, DPH launched a more thorough verification process and nine of the original 20 dispensaries were eliminated.\n\nPatriot Care Corp. has received a provisional certificate of registration for a proposed dispensary in Lowell. The company is also now allowed to apply for new locations for two dispensaries in the open counties. CEO Bob Mayerson says Patriot Care has already zeroed in on a site in Greenfield, in the western part of the state, and will now start seeking a site for a third proposed facility.\n\n\u201cFinding the right location that also has the perfect confluence of community support for that location is the challenge,\u201d Mayerson said.\n\nMass Medicum Corp., the fourth team seeking to open a dispensary in one of the seven open counties, says it will look at sites in Suffolk County.\n\nKaren van Unen, executive director of the state\u2019s medical marijuana program, told the teams at an informational session on Wednesday that the scores on their original applications will stand, but they\u2019ll have to submit extensive documentation to apply for the new sites. They will then go through the more extensive vetting the other teams did.\n\n\u201cDepending on how the verification process goes, additional decisions may need to be made,\u201d van Unen said, indicating that any problems discovered on applications might lead to disqualification. \u201cBut you\u2019re literally picking [up] where you left off.\u201d\n\nThe dispensary groups that have already received provisional certificates are now moving on to local permitting and state inspections.\n\nRelated Coverage:\n\nStory continues below\n\nMost Popular Expand", "article_metadata": {"description": "Four dispensary teams were invited to apply in seven counties that so far do not have any dispensaries in the planning stage.", "og": {"site_name": "wbur", "description": "Four dispensary teams were invited to apply in seven counties that so far do not have any dispensaries in the planning stage.", "title": "Mass.
