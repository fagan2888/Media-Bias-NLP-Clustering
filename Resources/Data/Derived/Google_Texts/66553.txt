MOUNT KISCO, N.Y. -- It's been a time in the healthcare industry when when it seems the only constant has been change.

Joel Seligman knows that better than most.

The president and chief executive officer of Northern Westchester Hospital in Mount Kisco, Seligman oversaw NWH's recent partnership agreement with North Shore-LIJ, which operates 12 hospitals in New York City and Long Island.

"They're all these opportunities to make the system better, and I believe that's what we're living through," Seligman said. "I think we're in Year 2 or 3 of a 10-year revolution that is going to be very chaotic and disjointed and is not going to feel good all the time, but at the end of it, I think we will have for the first time something you can call a healthcare delivery system."

Our changing healthcare system is among the topics Seligman discussed with Daily Voice Founder and CEO Carll Tucker in the latest installment of a new series "Daily Voice Leaders," which spotlights many of the key decision makers in Westchester County.

Seligman also discussed:

Area hospitals' partnership and growth efforts.

Future of the "Community Hospital" atmosphere.

Changes NWH patients can expect.

How current growth might play out.

Long-term outlook for NWH.

Affordable Care Act.
