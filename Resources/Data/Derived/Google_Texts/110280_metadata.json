This legislation funds the operations of government for the remainder of the fiscal year. Wonder Woman fans can cheer that buried in the bill was a $10,000 grant for a theater program to explore the comic book heroine.\n\nThis $85 billion war budget contains $6 billion earmarked for projects benefiting\u2026 big defense contractors.\n\nThat is just one of the many outrageous projects buried in this 1,582-page bill. The legislation gives the Department of Education more money to continue nationalizing education via \u201ccommon core.\u201d Also, despite new evidence of Obamacare\u2019s failure emerging on an almost daily basis, the Omnibus bill does nothing to roll back this disastrous law.\n\nEven though the Omnibus bill dramatically increases government spending, it passed with the support of many self-described \u201cfiscal conservatives.\u201d Those wondering why anyone who opposes increasing spending on programs like common core and Obamacare would vote for the bill, may find an answer in the fact that the legislation increases funding for the \u201cOverseas Continuing Operations\u201d \u2014 which is the official name for the war budget \u2014 for the first time since 2010. This $85 billion war budget contains $6 billion earmarked for projects benefiting Boeing, Lockheed-Martin, and other big defense contractors.\n\nEver since \u201csequestration\u201d went into effect at the beginning of last year, the military-industrial complex\u2019s congressional cheering session has complained that sequestration imposed \u201cdraconian cuts\u201d on the Pentagon that will \u201cdecimate\u201d our military \u2014 even though most of the \u201ccuts\u201d were actually reductions in the \u201cprojected rate of growth.\u201d In fact, under sequestration, defense spending was to increase by 18 percent over ten years, as opposed to growing by 20 percent without sequestration.\n\nMany of the defenders of increased war spending are opponents of welfare, but they are willing to set aside their opposition to increased welfare spending in order to increase warfare spending. They are supported in this position by the lobbyists for the military-industrial complex and the neoconservatives, whose continued influence on foreign policy is mystifying. After all, the neocons were the major promoters of the disastrous military intervention in Iraq.\n\nWhile many neocons give lip service to limiting domestic spending, their main priority remains protecting high levels of military spending to maintain an interventionist foreign policy. The influence of the neocons provides intellectual justification for politicians to vote for ever-larger military budgets \u2014 and break the campaign promises to vote against increases in spending and debt.\n\nFortunately, in recent years more Americans have recognized that a constant defense of liberty requires opposing both war and welfare. Many of these Americans, especially the younger ones, have joined the intellectual and political movement in favor of limiting government in all areas. This movement presents the most serious challenge the bipartisan welfare-warfare consensus has faced in generations. Hopefully, the influence of this movement will lead to bipartisan deals cutting both welfare and warfare spending.\n\nThe question facing Americans is not whether Congress will ever cut spending. The question is will the spending be reduced in an orderly manner that avoids inflecting massive harm on those depending on government programs, or will spending be slashed in response to an economic crisis caused by ever-increasing levels of deficit spending. Because politicians are followers rather than leaders, it is ultimately up to the people what course we will take. This is why it is vital that those of us who understand the dangerous path we are currently on do all we can to expand the movement for liberty, peace, and prosperity.\n\nRegards,\n\nRon Paul\n\nfor The Daily Reckoning\n\nEd.
