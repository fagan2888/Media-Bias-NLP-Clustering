The rule has been well-received among some patient advocates, but congressional Democrats have been largely silent, while the pharmaceutical industry and medical community have waged an aggressive campaign to stop it.\n\nThe campaign is bearing fruit. The letter from House Democrats, according to Drew Hammill, a spokesman for House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi (Calif.), was made necessary because Big Pharma and oncologist lobbyists had pushed many Democrats to the brink of signing a much more aggressive Republican letter. The letter expresses concerns with the proposed rule, but doesn't call for it to be withdrawn.\n\n\"Members are outlining their concerns, but this letter is in furtherance of getting an effective rule in place under the current timeline. This in no way is an effort to slow down or undermine the administration' s efforts,\" Hammill told HuffPost after this story published.\n\nOn Wednesday, Hammill said: \"A number of members have expressed concern about the scope and size of this initiative while recognizing problems with current payment rules. Leader Pelosi hopes that CMS will continue to actively engage members and advocacy organizations as the particulars of this test are finalized.\"\n\nHammill said Pelosi is urging members to sign the letter, which is being circulated by Rep. Richard Neal (D-Mass.).\n\nThe Democratic letter gives HHS the opportunity to quickly answer the questions and move forward with the rule, while the GOP missive aims to stop it cold. All of the tussling takes place amid the implicit threat to attach a rider to legislation that would block the rule. If Republicans think they can do so without much Democratic opposition, there's little to stop them. Pelosi's alternate letter can be seen as an attempt to show there is division between the parties in how frightened they respectively are of the powerful lobbies at work here.\n\nPelosi encouraged her caucus to get behind the Neal letter to fend off the GOP attack. In fact, Pelosi\u2019s office even helped with the letter: Democrats forgot to scrub their data from the document before circulating it, and an inspection of its properties reveals that it was last handled by a health policy fellow in Pelosi\u2019s office.\n\nThe Republican letter simply asks for HHS to withdraw its new rule, citing \"deep concerns.\"\n\nPushing an alternate letter is a strategy Pelosi has employed effectively before. When the administration wanted to issue a rule insisting that brokers have a fiduciary duty to clients, Republicans were in full-throated opposition, and Pelosi created a rival outlet for Democrats to go on record with their concerns. The rule went forward and a vote against it later on Thursday is expected to gather little Democratic support.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A fight over drug prices is entering a new phase.", "sailthru.expire_date": "2016-04-28 13:14:36 -0400", "og": {"site_name": "The Huffington Post", "description": "A fight over drug prices is entering a new phase.", "title": "House Democrats Push Back On Obama Plan To Cut Drug Prices", "url": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/house-democrats-hhs-drug-prices_us_5720e639e4b0b49df6a9c93f", "image": "http://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/2000_1000/5720eb2c2200002900254abe.jpeg?cache=sgeitgd8uy", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A fight over drug prices is entering a new phase.", "title": "House Democrats Push Back On Obama Plan To Cut Drug Prices", "image": {"width": 2000, "identifier": "http://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/2000_1000/5720eb2c2200002900254abe.jpeg?cache=sgeitgd8uy", "height": 1000}, "creator": "@ryangrim,@JeffYoung", "site": "@HuffPostPol", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2016-04-27 13:14:36 -0400", "al": {"ios": {"url": "huffpostnews:///?editionID=us&entryID=us_5720e639e4b0b49df6a9c93f", "app_store_id": 306621789, "app_name": "The Huffington Post"}}, "taboola.category": "politics", "fb": {"app_id": 46744042133}, "keywords": "PhRMA,medicare part b,Richard Neal,prescription drugs,HHS,must reads", "article": {"section": "Politics", "tag": "PhRMA,medicare part b,Richard Neal,prescription drugs,HHS,must reads", "published_time": "2016-04-27 13:14:36 -0400", "modified_time": "2016-04-28 11:32:51 -0400", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/jcydc"}, "viewport": "width=1000"}, "article_summary": "WASHINGTON -- A group of House Democrats is organizing an effort that could slow down an Obama administration plan to reduce drug prices, according to a letter obtained by The Huffington Post.\nThe letter from House Democrats, according to Drew Hammill, a spokesman for House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi (Calif.), was made necessary because Big Pharma and oncologist lobbyists had pushed many Democrats to the brink of signing a much more aggressive Republican letter.\nHammill said Pelosi is urging members to sign the letter, which is being circulated by Rep.
