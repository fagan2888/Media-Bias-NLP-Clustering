There were 80 veterans in the Senate from 1973 to 1975, and 347 in the House from 1977 to 1978.\n\nSenate Historian Donald A. Ritchie says that military service used to be very helpful in winning elections. Having fewer veterans now has a downside for comity in Congress.\n\n\u201cIn the past there were active reserve units on Capitol Hill and veterans used to meet for service-related breakfasts and other occasions,\u201d Ritchie says. \u201cThose included members of both parties and both ends of the political spectrum, and helped to bridge some of the partisan divides.\u201d\n\n\n\nOne of the best-known veterans on Capitol Hill is Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), who was a prisoner of war in Vietnam. Rep. Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.) lost both legs in the Iraq war. The three House members who served the longest ago \u2013 all in the 1940s \u2013 are Republican Ralph Hall of Texas and Democrat John Dingell of Michigan, both of whom served in World War II, and Democrat Charles Rangel of New York, who served just after the war. Sen. Mark Kirk (R-Ill.), a Navy reservist, served in three different military actions: Bosnia, Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\n>> Get discounts on health products and services with your AARP Member Advantages.\n\nOne senator and eight House members are still serving in the Reserves, and six House members are still serving in the National Guard, according to the Congressional Research Service.\n\nChart: Pew Research Center\n\nAlso of Interest\n\nSee the AARP home page for deals, savings tips, trivia and more", "article_metadata": {"page_title": "blog", "twitter": {"description": "Why are there so few veterans in Congress these days?
