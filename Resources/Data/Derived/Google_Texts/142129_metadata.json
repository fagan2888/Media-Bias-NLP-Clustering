Chris Christie won his war of words with Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky over government surveillance. But the combative presidential hopeful fell off his high horse by aligning with the Wall Street-Washington axis seeking to convert Social Security into a glorified means-tested welfare program.\n\nDeclaring the social-insurance system \u201cbroken\u201d is no way to win a primary, let alone the presidency. Like Walter Mondale\u2019s ill-fated pledge to raise taxes in 1984, promising to overhaul earned-benefit programs that remain popular with older Americans would assure electoral shipwreck. As Bush 41 veteran Lloyd Green notes, seniors haven\u2019t voted Democratic since 1992; in 2012, Republicans captured voters older than 45 years of age.\n\nMr. Christie also sounded like overpaid multinational executives who think U.S. wages are too high, whining that Social Security and Medicare consume too much of the federal budget. He framed things completely backward: These self-financing programs have been budget bracers, not budget busters, for a generation.\n\nIndeed, revenues flowing into the four related earned-benefit funds (Social Security, disability, Medicare hospitalization, and Medicare supplementary medical) have generated annual surpluses since the late 1980s, ranging from $121 billion to $221 billion between 1998 and 2009. Not even President Obama\u2019s payroll-tax cut in 2011 and 2012 spilled red ink on the combined balance sheet.\n\nYes, the retirement of the baby boomers and disability claims are eating into those surpluses; the 2014 excess, for example, was merely $11 billion. But the governor and his fellow candidates should be yanking at the roots of the projected shortfalls: slow-growth, upside-down demographics \u2014 including anemic marriage and birth rates triggered by Roe v. Wade \u2014 and the hemorrhaging of private-sector, family-wage jobs stemming from ballooning trade deficits.\n\nToo bad Mr. Christie wasn\u2019t briefed by CNBC host Larry Kudlow, a fellow Garden State conservative eyeing a U.S. Senate run, who argues Social Security would be \u201cin fine shape\u201d if annual GDP growth was 3.5 percent. Instead, the governor risks outdoing Mitt Romney, who infamously demeaned 47 percent of Americans as \u201ctakers.\u201d\n\nGiven the dislocations shaking Middle America, this is no time for any Republican to weaken the rung that tens of millions of aging middle-income folk have been clinging to since the 2008 market crash. As Jack Kemp\u2019s top economic adviser, John Mueller, insists: Pay-as-you-go social insurance can \u201cprovide a valuable form of retirement security that the private market cannot duplicate.\u201d\n\nEspecially as Wall Street has reaped bonanza after bonanza since George H.W. Bush slashed taxes on capital (while boosting taxes on labor) and Bill Clinton dismantled the Glass-Steagall firewall separating investment from commercial banking, as well as windfalls from the Troubled Asset Relief Program and a host of corporatist-globalist trade deals. All these policy departures from the Reagan era have devastated the U.S. manufacturing sector, a key source of American strength and wealth, and the economic security of Americans without college degrees.\n\nMr. Christie claimed his cuts will mostly hit well-endowed households with annual retirement income in excess of $200,000. Yet who among Republican voters \u2014 most of whom support increased funding of Social Security and Medicare, according to the Pew Research Center \u2014 believes middle-income folk would be spared?\n\nOn the stump, Mr. Christie likewise peddles the \u201cpremium-support\u201d theories of House Ways and Means Chairman Paul Ryan, proposals that would force seniors to bargain-hunt with insurance carriers, mega-hospitals, pharmaceutical giants and medical specialists. Another winning idea for the campaign trail.\n\nThough Americans may not like Obamacare, they still prefer having a third party \u2014 whether it be employers or a trusted system like Medicare in retirement \u2014 mediating for them the \u201cbig, complicated, nutty, messy market,\u201d as columnist Peggy Noonan describes the health sector.\n\nInstead of relitigating the New Deal, the GOP should heed Carly Fiorina, the candidate enjoying the biggest debate boost, who last week demanded that the government \u201cget its house in order before it goes to the American people and takes something away from them.\u201d\n\nBetter yet, follow the promising path pioneered by Mike Huckabee. Rather than \u201crob seniors of the benefits our government promised\u201d and they paid for, the former Arkansas governor is promoting research, in line with House Energy and Commerce Chairman Fred Upton\u2019s 21st-Century Cures Act, to combat debilitating diseases like Alzheimer\u2019s, which now cost the U.S. health system $200 billion a year.\n\nNot only would cures preserve Medicare by reducing long-term outlays, but more importantly, they would deliver a tangible coveted by the voters while rebranding the GOP as the party of science, progress and growth.\n\nPerhaps Chris Christie is too invested in ideological budget-cutting to learn from his debating companions. But as long as he entertains privatizing Social Security and Medicare for the sake of America\u2019s bondholders, the New Jersey heavyweight won\u2019t redeem his low single-digit poll numbers \u2014 or connect with middle-income voters that his party desperately need to win not just the debates, but the election of 2016.\n\n\u2022 Robert W.
