She was wonderful,\u201d Marcus Roach, 39, of Clairton said about his friend of 18 years. \u201cShe was my go-out-and-eat buddy, my Applebee's buddy.\u201d\n\nJones' relationship with the man whom police identified as the main suspect in her death, William Arrington, 36, of Turtle Creek, got serious in April, Roach said. It soured recently, however, and Jones, 32, told Roach that she was going to end it, he said.\n\nRoach led police to Jones' house along McMasters Avenue in Wilkins about 12:30 a.m. Saturday, and police found her cellphone in the toilet and evidence of a struggle. They found her body in woods across the street. An autopsy is pending.\n\nArrington was \u201cmost likely responsible\u201d for Jones' death, Homicide Unit Lt. Andrew Schurman said. Arrington had not been charged as of 9 p.m. Saturday.\n\nArrington shot himself and was in critical condition in a local hospital, Schurman said. He was transported there from a family member's house in Wilkinsburg on Saturday afternoon, the lieutenant said.\n\nRoach said Arrington, whom he also knew, was originally from Philadelphia.\n\nJones' children are 16 and 10, Roach said. She worked as a tax preparer for Jackson Hewitt and in the housing department of the Urban League of Greater Pittsburgh, said the Downtown nonprofit's president, Esther Bush, who recalled teasing Jones about her first name when they met.\n\n\u201cWe smiled about it, and I told her I appreciated having somebody with a name that sweet working at the Urban League,\u201d Bush said.\n\nIn November 2010, Arrington pleaded guilty to two counts each of terroristic threats and simple assault. He was sentenced to three to six months in jail and two years of probation.\n\nHe pleaded guilty in May 2008 to robbery, aggravated assault and intimidating a witness or victim. Common Pleas Judge Donald E. Machen sentenced him to 11\u00bd to 23 months in the Allegheny County Jail.\n\nMonday will be a difficult day at work, Bush said.\n\n\u201cThe Urban League is very much involved in trying to stop the violence in the community working with different coalitions and on a national level,\u201d Bush said. \u201cWhen something like this happens, and it hits very close to home, the message is just too clear how we need to stop this violence in our neighborhood.\u201d\n\nStaff writer Natasha Lindstrom contributed to this report.
