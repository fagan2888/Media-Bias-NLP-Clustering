And going through another transition like that would be very difficult.\u201d\n\nTo be clear, small businesses in Vermont still have to buy plans sold on the exchange. They just don\u2019t have to purchase those plans through the state-run insurance portal known as Vermont Health Connect.\n\nDirect enrollment with private insurers has worked so far, according to Bishop, so policy makers ought to leave well enough alone.\n\nThere\u2019s one problem though: The federal Affordable Care Act requires Vermont to develop an exchange for small businesses.\n\nLawrence Miller, chief of health care reform for the Shumlin administration, shares Bishop\u2019s view on the uselessness of developing of what state and federal bureaucrats call a \u201cSHOP,\u201d (or the Small Business Health Options Program.)\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re doing in Vermont works,\u201d says Miller. \u201cLet\u2019s not spend extra money on an extra SHOP website that doesn\u2019t add a whole lot of value.\u201d\n\nThe obstacle to that plan lies in something called section 1332 of Obamacare. Miller says the state will soon seek a special waiver that would allow it to avoid the small business exchange mandate contained in that provision.\n\n\"What we're doing in Vermont works. Let's not spend extra money on an extra shop website that doesn't add a whole lot of value.\" - Lawrence Miller, chief of health care reform for the Shumlin administration\n\nIf Vermont doesn\u2019t get the waiver, then it has three possible options. It could use a federal version of the SHOP website, which would carry minimal costs. It could buy an exchange for small businesses from a state that got theirs to work.\n\n\u201cOr we could do what in my mind is the worst choice of all,\u201d Miller says, \u201cwhich is build out SHOP as part of the existing infrastructure build at Vermont Health Connect, which would probably be a $10 or $12 million exercise.\u201d\n\nMiller says the state likely won\u2019t learn until next year whether it will get a waiver from the federal mandate. He will present these three options to lawmakers on Friday, in case Vermont doesn\u2019t receive a waiver.", "article_metadata": {"category": "VPR News", "description": "When it comes to buying health insurance, the last few years have been a roller coaster for small businesses in Vermont.
