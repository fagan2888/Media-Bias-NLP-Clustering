Officials estimated that as many as 100,000 travelers could pass through the station daily once rail service starts in 2016.\n\nAbout 50 percent of downtown workers now commute by alternative transit \u2014 on foot, or by bus, bike or light rail \u2014 rather than cars, and city planners said it\u2019s time for a change in traffic flow to try to accommodate everyone.\n\nOther one-way sections have been the topic of discussion for change.\n\nThose spots are Welton Street between 15th and 17th streets, and East 19th Avenue between Broadway and Park Avenue and East 20th Avenue between Park and Lincoln Street.\n\nRyan Parker: 303-954-2409, rparker@denverpost.com or twitter.com/ryanparkerdp", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Downtown 18th Street will be converted for two-way traffic", "title": "Downtown 18th Street will be converted for two-way traffic", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/01/17/downtown-18th-street-will-be-converted-for-two-way-traffic/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140117__20140118_A3_CD1818THSTREETp1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140117__20140118_A3_CD1818THSTREETp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-01-17T20:24:50+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-28T06:03:55+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf67c\"", "article_summary": "A section of a downtown Denver street is being converted from a one-way to accommodate visitors to the LoDo area, the manager of Denver Public Works announced Friday.\nThe cost of the project is $550,000, and work will begin this summer, said Emily Williams, Denver Public Works spokeswoman.\nThe two-block stretch of 18th Street between Wynkoop and Blake streets will be converted from a one-way to a two-way section, according to Denver Public Works.\nStudies were launched in response to developments at Denver Union Station that would necessitate the change.\nThe decision to convert the stretch followed an in-depth study, professional observations and stakeholder meetings, according to Denver Public Works."}
