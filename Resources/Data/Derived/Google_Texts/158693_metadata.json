But agencies may gain an advantage if they also are involved before a patient even enters the hospital for treatment.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t like to use the word post-acute anymore,\u201d says Keith Myers, CEO of LHC Group (NASDAQ: LCHG). \u201cWe say regularly now that we\u2019re not post-acute, we\u2019re non-acute. In many of our hospital joint ventures, we\u2019re having just as big an impact on the pre-acute side.\u201d\n\nLHC Group is in a particularly good position to comment on the evolving relationship between home health providers and hospitals. Hospital joint ventures have long been a niche play for the Lafayette, Louisiana-based company, which employs more than 10,000 people and has a 25-state footprint. About 50% of LHC\u2019s revenue comes from JV relationships with hospitals and health systems, Myers pointed out in a recent conversation with Home Health Care News.\n\nCurrently, LHC Group has partnered with more 60 hospitals and health systems, including a recently inked JV with Baton Rouge General Hospital. Preventing \u201ccostly and avoidable hospital readmissions\u201d is one of the key objectives of that venture, Myers stated in a press release when the deal was announced earlier this month. And preventing readmissions is a goal that many home health providers now have\u2014Affordable Care Act policies mean hospitals face Medicare reimbursement cuts if they readmit too many patients, incentivizing them to work more exclusively with home health agencies that can stop that from happening.\n\nSince forging its first hospital joint venture in 1998, just four years after its founding, LHC has developed a time-tested approach to prevent rehospitalizations.\n\n\u201cThe critical first step is to have the ability to risk-stratify your patient population and to update that on a regular basis,\u201d Myers says. \u201cIf we have 500 patients on census at one of our JV locations, we have to know which 50 are highest risk and focus additional resources\u2014which we don\u2019t typically get reimbursed for in fee-for-service\u2014to those patients, to bend the cost curve by avoiding unnecessary inpatient costs.\u201d\n\nA call center at the LHC home office takes calls from the field, and workers there follow scripts so that they can efficiently triage alerts and deploy caregivers to intervene before a hospital readmission is necessary, Myers says. Utilizing high-skilled clinicians such as nurse practitioners is another key part of the strategy.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve learned over 22 years, that\u2019s how you avoid the rehospitalizations,\u201d he says.\n\nBut a singular focus on rehospitalization may not be enough to be a stand-out hospital partner these days. Recent Medicare initiatives, such as a bundled payment program for hip and knee replacements, make it imperative for hospitals and their partners to keep quality high while making the episode of care as cost-efficient as possible. Here, a pre-acute focus is a differentiator, Myers says.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re helping to drive value in the hospitals that are in those [hip and knee] bundles,\u201d he says, \u201cI don\u2019t have the data readily available, but I\u2019ll take a shot and say one-third or more of the value we\u2019re creating is coming from our interaction with patients on a pre-acute basis. Planning the care path before surgery is resulting in reduction in length-of-stay by about 30% to 35% on those patients. So it\u2019s not just reducing rehospitalization, but bringing down length-of-stay post-op. And, they\u2019re moving out of the hospital to home health faster because of our interaction.\u201d\n\nLHC Group is not the only home health provider that sees itself occupying the \u201cnon-acute\u201d category; the concept has been embraced by the Partnership for Quality Home Healthcare, a provider association that Myers currently chairs. LHC Group also certainly is not the only provider pursuing hospital partnerships\u2014and the volume of potential transactions in its docket indicates just how avid hospitals are to find the right \u201cnon-acute\u201d partners.\n\nAs of the third quarter of 2015, LHC Group had reviewed more than 264 acquisition or hospital JV opportunities, Myers said on an earnings call in November. While he did not share exact updated numbers in advance of this week\u2019s upcoming earnings release, he indicated that the pipeline is not getting any smaller.\n\nWritten by Tim Mullaney", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Home Health Care News", "description": "When it comes to preventing hospital readmissions and controlling costs after joint replacements and similar procedures, home health agencies and other post-acute providers play a crucial role.
