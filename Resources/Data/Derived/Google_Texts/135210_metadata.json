Short Term Medical is a great option for financial protection during that period in case the unexpected happens.\n\nThe IHC Group announces Connect Net, a new Short Term Medical (STM) plan underwritten by Independence American Insurance Company (IAIC). Combining IHC\u2019s 20-year experience in administering and underwriting STM, Connect Net plans are designed for consumers who want protection from the financial impact of an unexpected claim while they are waiting for a permanent major medical plan to become effective.\n\nBenefits of Connect Net include affordability and broader network access versus the standard STM plans thanks to IHC\u2019s partnership with a national carrier. It also features an office visit copayment, copayments for prescription drugs and a $2,000,000 coverage limit per policy period.\n\n\u201cOne of the most common questions we are asked on our website, http://www.healthedeals.com, is what are the enrollment deadlines for an Obamacare plan,\u201d said Dave Keller, Chief Marketing Officer of IHC Specialty Benefits. \u201cMany people are procrastinators, and they are surprised to find out when they are ready to enroll for a permanent plan that the start date for their Obamacare policy can be as much as 45 days from the day they apply. Short Term Medical is a great way to provide financial protection during that period in case the unexpected happens.\u201d\n\nConsumers can choose a monthly pay option for their short term medical needs, or a pre-payment option for up to 185 days. These plans are not designed to replace Obamacare coverage, but to bridge the gap between open enrollment periods.\n\nEnrollment for Connect Net can be done entirely on-line with the help of a licensed insurance agent, or by calling 888-452-6522.
