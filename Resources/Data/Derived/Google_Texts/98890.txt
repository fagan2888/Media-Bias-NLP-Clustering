A retrial for a 31-year-old man charged in a Lawrence apartment killing has ended in another hung jury.

The Lawrence Journal-World reports that Douglas County District Judge Paula Martin declared a mistrial Friday in Dustin D. Walker's felony murder trial. Prosecutors alleged that Walker killed 39-year-old Patrick Roberts in March 2014 during a botched robbery attempt. But defense attorney Blake Glover said Walker and his cousin, Archie Robinson, didn't break into Roberts' apartment but went there to buy marijuana.

Walker was already convicted of an aggravated burglary charge at his first trial in February, but those jurors could not agree on the felony murder charge. Prosecutors plan to announce Dec. 2 whether they will seek another retrial.

Robinson, of Topeka, was convicted earlier in the killing.
