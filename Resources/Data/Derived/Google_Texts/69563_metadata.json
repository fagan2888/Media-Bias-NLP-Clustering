Elaine Schwartz, D-Hollywood.\n\n\u201cIs there any reason why anyone should go to medical school unless they wanted to be a surgeon?\u201d she asked.\n\nRep. Cary Pigman, R-Avon Park, says the 155-page bill is really about providing access to care in communities without enough physicians. That\u2019s accomplished by lifting the mandate that nurse practitioners work under physician supervision and the ban on their prescribing controlled substances, he said.\n\n\u201cIn my neck of the woods, this is the difference between access and none at all,\u201d said Pigman, a hospital emergency room doctor.\n\nSeveral legislators and a lobbyist for the Florida Medical Association criticized how the bill will increase the number of people allowed to prescribe controlled substances. The highly addictive narcotics are at the heart of Florida\u2019s notorious pill-mill crisis.\n\nIn a written statement that quoted FMA President Alan Harmon, the group said: \"Florida is on the verge of recovering from a massive statewide pill-mill crisis. Yet now, the Florida House is considering a bill that would unleash thousands of new practitioners into our communities with prescription pads poised to prescribe narcotics.\"\n\nNot all nurses would be affected by the bill. It creates standards for \"advanced practice\" registered nurses, which includes nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, nurse anesthetists and nurse midwives.\n\nPigman said that although the bill removes restrictions on nurse practitioners, it does not increase their scope of practice beyond their skills and training. For example, he said, the bill would not allow nurse practitioners to perform abortions.\n\n\u201cWe were extraordinarily careful that only a doctor can perform an abortion,\u201d he said.\n\nAnd doctors who specialize should not feel their business is being crowded out, Pigman said. The bill would not create new nurse \u201cspecialties,\u201d such as dermatology, unless the Florida Board of Nursing opts to add them.\n\n\u201cThis in no way eliminates the physician\u2019s ability to care,\u201d he said.\n\nNurse practitioners also would be required to carry the same level of insurance as doctors, the bill says. The advanced practice registered nurses are not guaranteed they would be paid the same as doctors, the bill said. They would also have to negotiate reimbursement rates with private insurance companies, just like doctors.\n\nRep. Jose Oliva, R-Hialeah and the special committee\u2019s chairman, said the bill would echo rules already enacted in dozens of other states.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not trailblazing here. It\u2019s already been done,\u201d he said.\n\n--Health News Florida is part of WUSF Public Media.
