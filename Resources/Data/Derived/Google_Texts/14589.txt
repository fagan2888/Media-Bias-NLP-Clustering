Through June 5: For William Stockman, art is a daily ritual. He consumes information around him — through news accounts or personal observation — and makes it a muse for his frequent drawings. Stockman’s not reporting current events exactly, but reducing the characters he encounters to basic archetypes, simply rendered in charcoal or pastel. “Athletes, politicians, disaster victims, celebrities and characters from Stockman’s life find themselves born again as rough-edged apparitions,” according to Gildar Gallery, which hosts a show of recent work curated by Simon Zalkind. “Someone Called Me By My Name,” Gildar Gallery, 82 S.
