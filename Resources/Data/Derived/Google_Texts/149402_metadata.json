Jay Livingstone, Winthrop Housing Authority Chairman Joseph Boncore, Lydia Edwards, Paul Rogers and Diana Hwang. The First Suffolk and Middlesex District Senate district encompasses Revere, Winthrop, East Boston and other parts of Boston and Cambridge.\n\nRizzo served one term as Revere mayor until he lost the seat by 117 votes last year. He served as a councilor-at-large for a dozen years, and is the longtime owner of an insurance agency. Rizzo said he knows the value of a legislative seat to a city or town, which prompted his decision to run.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a seat I\u2019m very prepared for and I could make an effective difference starting on the first day,\u201d he said.\n\nIf elected, Rizzo said the opioid epidemic would be a top priority. He said while Beacon Hill has adopted legislation to combat narcotics abuse, it will also take other measures to solve the problem. Rizzo said the district has among the highest rates for drug abuse and overdoses.\n\nRizzo would also invest in what he called a \u201c21st century transportation system,\u201d including commuter rail, roads, bridges and sidewalks. He also wants to invest in education, and making sure schools are funded so students can keep up with the global economy. Rizzo also cited job creation and affordable housing as key issues.\n\nMorabito is serving his second term as a Revere councilor-at-large. He has worked as a manager at Johnnie\u2019s Foodmaster for 18 years. As a city councilor, he learned much about state laws and what a city can and cannot do, he said. If elected, he said he would resign from the council.\n\nMorabito said he would also focus on the opioid crisis, and providing treatment for addicts who want to beat their addiction, rather than serve jail time. He would continue work begun by Gov. Charlie Baker, who signed a bill this month that would make it more difficult for opioid prescriptions to be written and abused. Morabito said he would also focus on fair wage equality and getting funding for early education.\n\n\u201cNot all issues can be handled on the local level,\u201d he said. \u201cThis developed in me as a desire to help people. I can help more people as a state senator than I can on the local level.\u201d\n\nLivingstone, a second term state representative, said if elected, he would build on work he\u2019s done in the House. He supports early education funding, criminal reform and equal pay for women.\n\nPrior to serving in the House, Livingstone was a labor law attorney.\n\nAs the only legislator in the race, he has an advantage because of his relationships with House and Senate lawmakers, he said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m already in the middle of some of the issues that will be dealt with,\u201d Livingstone said.\n\nBoncore has been a member of the Winthrop Housing Authority for six years, and is a public defender in Boston and Chelsea courts where he works with clients who are mentally ill or suffering from addiction. He said the commonwealth is spending too much money putting addicts in jail, when rehabilitation programs cost half as much.\n\nHe would also focus on ensuring that children have access to quality schools.\n\n\u201cEducation is a great equalizer in our society,\u201d he said. \u201cToo many children are falling through the cracks. Pre-K needs to be universal throughout the district and the commonwealth.\u201d\n\nEnsuring public transportation is available and working is his priority, citing immobility as the major cause of poverty in society. He would work to reinstate late-night service on the commuter rail and keep fares reasonable.\n\nEdwards is a legal services attorney at Greater Boston Legal Services, a Boston-based agency that provides free legal assistance to low-income residents, where she learned Spanish and Portuguese. Edwards also lobbied to bring about the domestic workers bill of rights. Enacted in 2014, the measure bans discrimination for people of color and lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender workers.\n\nWhile working on the legislation, Edwards said she learned to navigate the State House.\n\nIf elected, Edwards said she would focus on income equality, affordable housing and development, affordable education and transportation.\n\n\u201cThe fact of the matter is, change comes to the State House,\u201d she said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t come from within the State House.\n\nRogers has been a small business owner in the software and technology field for 20 years. But he said most people know him in East Boston for his work in the community as a leader in social media. Rogers\u2019 Facebook group \u201cEast Boston Open Discussion\u201d has nearly 6,000 members, he said, and has been a great way for residents to have a voice in what\u2019s happening in the community.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m different because I\u2019ve already been out in this community before this campaign even started,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is nothing really new for me.\u201d\n\nRogers\u2019s priorities would be public education, public transportation, and housing and development, he said. He said people have been priced out of housing in the district because developers are purchasing property and raising rents. Rogers said he would work to find solutions to stabilize the housing market so people could afford to continue living in the neighborhood.\n\nIn education, he would focus on getting more computational-based sciences incorporated in classrooms.\n\nHwang is the founder and executive director of the Asian American Women\u2019s Political Initiative, the only political organization for Asian American leadership in the country. She started as an aide to former Rep. Deborah Blumer, who wrote the original Affordable Care Act.\n\nHwang said she has spent her career fighting for women and would focus on issues such as pay equity, family leave, women\u2019s reproductive rights and strengthening protection for victims of sexual, mental and physical abuse.\n\nHwang said she is a daughter of immigrants and felt how much her parents worried about money growing up. There was a time when both of her parents lost their jobs.\n\n\u201cThe people in this district need someone representing them, who understands their issues, and shares their struggle,\u201d Hwang said. \u201cI will be able to hit the ground running on the first day.\u201d\n\nGayla Cawley can be reached at gcawley@itemlive.com.
