It\u2019s not like illegal aliens are running around the country, getting picked up by the cops and then released when immigration won\u2019t touch them, only to go out on crime sprees, right? Unfortunately, we now need to stop by in Ohio and see yet another example of this phenomenon which doesn\u2019t happen. (Fox News)\n\nAn illegal immigrant suspected of murdering one woman, wounding another and attempting to rape a 14-year-old girl was released earlier this month by Ohio sheriff\u2019s deputies after U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents told them not to hold him, law enforcement officials said Tuesday. Juan Emmanuel Razo, 35, was arrested Monday after a shootout with police following a crime spree police say began with the attempted rape of a girl in a park in Painesville, about 30 miles northeast of Cleveland. He later shot a woman in front of her children and murdered a 60-year-old woman in nearby Concord Township, according to police. While Razo is being held on $10 million bond, authorities are trying to explain why he was allowed to remain in the U.S. illegally after local authorities questioned him just three weeks ago.\n\nI was doing some quick checking and it doesn\u2019t look like any of these places are even sanctuary cities. This was just a straight up case of the police getting hold of the guy, the feds telling them not to bother holding him or even knowing who he was, and his being cut loose because he wasn\u2019t currently wanted for any crimes aside from being here illegally. We may later find out what he\u2019d been up to prior to this, but the judge was obviously upset at the initial hearing.\n\n\u201cI have somebody who we don\u2019t know who he is, why he is in this country, why he is here illegally and why he allegedly committed a murder,\u201d Painesville Municipal Court Judge Michael Cicconetti thundered at Razo\u2019s arraignment, noting the suspect has no green card, birth certificate or driver\u2019s license. \u201cI can\u2019t set a bond high enough,\u201d he continued. \u201cHow in the hell do I even know it\u2019s him?\u201d Cicconetti later told Fox News he did not understand how federal authorities could have ordered Razo released on July 7 when local deputies questioned him and contacted Border Protection officials, given that no one could even verify his identity.\n\nWell, that answers the first of my questions. They couldn\u2019t even verify who Razo was because he didn\u2019t have any appropriate identification. (At least not accurate, legal identification.) But wait\u2026 weren\u2019t we supposed to be issuing ID to all of the illegal immigrants? I\u2019m sure somebody told me that that would help them come out of the shadows and be more productive citizens. Heck, they\u2019ve been doing it in New York all year.\n\nHere\u2019s a free clue for legislators when it comes to these proposals. This discussion is an almost perfect parallel to the gun control argument, as strange as that may sound. When you pass laws restricting the rights of law abiding citizens regarding gun ownership, the only people you actually impact are those who tend to obey the law. When you say we should give ID to all the illegal aliens, the ones who are living lives of crime are not going to be all that interested in a document which will help identify them.\n\nRazo is behind bars and, assuming we can manage to do anything that makes sense, is likely to stay there. That may come as small comfort to the family of his 60 year old murder victim, the children who saw their mother shot or the little girl he tried to rape. But you all keep on yelling at Trump. He clearly doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s talking about.\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "Man, that Trump guy has no idea what he\u2019s talking about, right?", "title": "Your next released illegal immigrant murderer is in \u2026 Ohio", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2015/07/29/your-next-released-illegal-immigrant-murderer-is-in-ohio/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary", "creator": "@JazzShaw"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "article": {"published_time": "2015-07-29T22:01:40+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-07-29T20:59:37+00:00"}, "keywords": "aliens, crime, Donald Trump, illegal immigrants, illegal immigration, murder, rape,", "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "article_summary": "Your next released illegal immigrant murderer is in \u2026 Ohioposted at 6:01 pm on July 29, 2015 by Jazz ShawBoy, that Trump guy was way off base, wasn\u2019t he?\nUnfortunately, we now need to stop by in Ohio and see yet another example of this phenomenon which doesn\u2019t happen.\nHe later shot a woman in front of her children and murdered a 60-year-old woman in nearby Concord Township, according to police.\nI\u2019m sure somebody told me that that would help them come out of the shadows and be more productive citizens.\nBut wait\u2026 weren\u2019t we supposed to be issuing ID to all of the illegal immigrants?"}
