Facebook is mulling the creation of health apps as part of an initiative that could also include online “support communities,” according to a report.

Reuters said the company has been meeting with medical industry experts and entrepreneurs and will create a group to test the apps. It said Facebook is still in the “idea-gathering stage.”

If Facebook does enter the health and wellness space, it will join an increasingly crowded market, alongside Apple’s new “Health” app, and Google’s program to advance medicine using big data.

Facebook’s potential move into healthcare could open a vast and valuable new area of data collection for the social network, which has been pushing for new ways to build detailed, personal profiles of its users so it can better target advertisements at them.

In June, Facebook began using the Internet browsing histories of its users for advertising purposes. It also required users to download a separate instant messaging app in order to send and receive Facebook messages on mobile phones, which could help Facebook gather data on user behavior.

Any Facebook move into health care will draw scrutiny from privacy advocates, who say Facebook has gone too far in its collection of user data. According to Reuters, Facebook may roll out its first health application “quietly and under a different name,” so as not to alert users that they are handing health information to Facebook. The report cited internal Facebook research that found many of its users were unaware that the image-sharing site Instagram is owned by Facebook.

A Facebook spokesman declined to comment.
