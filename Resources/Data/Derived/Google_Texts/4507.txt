The founder and president of the Christian Action Network, Martin Mawyer, was a guest on Fox News Channel’s Hannity where he said there are 35 terrorist training compounds scattered throughout the United States under the lead of Sheikh Gilani and governed by Muslims of America. Mayer explained that these groups are protected by the U.S. Constitution.

“We spent two-and-a-half years investigating this group and during that time we interviewed law enforcement about why these groups, why these facilities were allowed to exist in the United States. We got a host of reasons, but the number one reason is they are protected by the U.S. Constitution and they are protected by state constitutions in the United States. Really, law enforcement’s hands are tied in trying to shut these groups down.”

Mawyer said he believes these groups are planning another attack on Americans.

“Not only do I believe that, not only will people who watch this documentary believe that, but even the law enforcement officials that we have spoken with – not the ones based in Washington D.C., but the field officers – they believe that. We’ve had law enforcement tell us they have weapons of mass destruction.”

Mawyer was unable to disclose the specifics of the WMD’s to Hannity. He did say that al-Qaeda would “love” to have multiple compounds in the U.S. to hide terrorists and weapons.

“I would say without a doubt al-Qaeda would love to have such compounds that range from 25 acres to 300 acres sitting on American soil in order to hide terrorists, hide weapons, and train future jihadists for the United States. It’s shocking.” Advertisement – story continues below
