It has been a policy disaster for regular folks.\n\nHistory will note that Insure Tennessee came from their own governor. It was Gov. Bill Haslam\u2019s humanitarian proposal to extend Medicaid coverage to more than a quarter-million uninsured Tennesseans. What he got back, on a platter, was a miserable insult that unfolded shamefully over the two-year session.\n\nLast year the defiant Republican-led Senate marched the prisoner down to the dungeon. Last week, the Republican House speaker threw away the key, turning the matter over to a new \u201ctask force\u201d \u2014 all white, all male, all Republican. RIP, Insure Tennessee.\n\nLeft grieving on the sidelines, once again, are those thousands of uninsured folks from Memphis to Mountain City. Forget that the costs would be covered by federal dollars already set aside but spurned by your legislature. As Nashville Congressman Jim Cooper tweeted after the funeral:\n\n\u201cTennesseans waited 2 years while Gov. Haslam negotiated a plan with the federal gov\u2019t. ... Now we have to wait at least another year? Cancer patients don\u2019t have that kind of time.\u201d\n\nWhat the General Assembly did find enthusiasm for were the so-called \u201cbathroom bill\u201d with its callous ridicule of human beings, and also the loony \u201cBible bill\u201d to make it our official state book (Editor's note: Governor Haslam vetoed the Bible bill on Thursday) . Turns out that one has hidden costs that nobody thought about until Attorney General Herbert Slatery pointed out conflicts with Title IX. I only hope his news conference was a setup for a veto.\n\nBuy Photo Tennessean columnist Keel Hunt (Photo: File / The Tennessean)\n\nThese are lousy laws. Responsible leaders, in whatever days remain in this sorry session, should walk them back to committee. That would be a fine use of a \u201ctask force\u201d (read, graveyard) study. Failing that, both are worthy of the governor\u2019s veto.\n\nAdd to all that the legislature\u2019s failure to embrace a modern highway program and its disruptive meddling in Nashville\u2019s affordable housing policy and the stability of annexation progress in Memphis.\n\nWhat all these miseries have in common is this: They are the price we pay for legislative pandering to an array of special interests \u2014 ranging from government-hating think tanks to well-heeled developers to extremists who dislike anyone unlike themselves.\n\nWhat the rest of us get is national ridicule and the outsized costs, both human and economic, of unintended consequences.\n\nLook to our east, where North Carolina is now reaping the whirlwind for its version of the lamebrain \u201cbathroom bill\u201d \u2014 all thanks to legislators there who likewise cannot say \u201cno\u201d to meanness and extremism. Corporations, tourism leaders and high-grossing entertainers alike are now saying \u201cno\u201d to North Carolina. Is Tennessee next?\n\nSometimes elected officials, because they are so buffered at Legislative Plaza, confuse the glad-handing of their colleagues in the corridor for the approval of citizens back home. These are not the same thing, of course, and the legislature\u2019s rejection of Insure Tennessee demonstrates this point.\n\nActual polling, as recently as last week, has shown a majority of Tennesseans favor expanding Medicaid. Regular folks understand it is not Obamacare, and in any case they do not value political games over the needs of families and hospitals.\n\nBut this is what one-party government gets you: peevish politics, slavish pandering to the loudest screamers, no backbone, no courage, just small-gauged thinking, and they call it good policy.\n\nAmong the legislature\u2019s 132 members, there are indeed a handful of heroes who push back against this darkness, but they are isolated in this angry age. When our legislature is in session anymore, its gerrymandered majorities live in a comfort zone of no consequences, avoidance of accountability, and prideful politics with no thought of the price.\n\nAccountability will not come in the vaulted chambers of the state House and Senate. It will not come at all until August and November, when the next elections come.\n\nThat is when you and I \u2014 and the thousands of Tennesseans who were left uninsured, who are in fact not powerless \u2014 will have our say about the job performance of dunces.\n\nKeel Hunt is a Tennessean columnist and the author of \"Coup: The Day the Democrats Ousted Their Governor.\" Reach him at Keel@TSGNashville.com.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://tnne.ws/1Skm1Ex", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "One-party government gets you peevish politics, slavish pandering to the loudest screamers, no backbone, no courage.", "og": {"site_name": "The Tennessean", "description": "One-party government gets you peevish politics, slavish pandering to the loudest screamers, no backbone, no courage.", "title": "Train wreck: The price we pay for pandering", "url": "http://www.tennessean.com/story/opinion/columnists/2016/04/17/train-wreck-price-we-pay-pandering/83030062/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/tennessean.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "One-party government gets you peevish politics, slavish pandering to the loudest screamers, no backbone, no courage.", "title": "Train wreck: The price we pay for pandering", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/b57b6bb2f84024eb6cf4deb5a0dba1337f30afba/c=85-0-423-338&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2016/02/24/Nashville/Nashville/635919060901216686-ttdnashville.jpg", "creator": "@tennessean", "site": "@tennessean", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600028886", "fb": {"app_id": 121487414583460}, "viewport": "width=1070", "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Organizations/Tennessee General Assembly", "gci-asset-type": "story", "gci-categories": "Organizations/Tennessee General Assembly", "title": "Train wreck: The price we pay for pandering", "author": "Keel Hunt", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "opinion/columnists", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/1a96f19545d172efd667ce6f47805eed34491670/c=173-0-427-338/local/-/media/2016/02/24/Nashville/Nashville/635919060901216686-ttdnashville.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/cb83d05393f3e4cb17f6c96aa5c9c5d9b89c2048/c=85-0-423-338/local/-/media/2016/02/24/Nashville/Nashville/635919060901216686-ttdnashville.jpg", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/d6f29255218053fbec4160e0e8e0ed0ac2642b45/c=29-0-479-338/local/-/media/2016/02/24/Nashville/Nashville/635919060901216686-ttdnashville.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/a7c4cfb5482912500b9de90e34331fe94a4e0361/c=0-52-506-338&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/2016/02/24/Nashville/Nashville/635919060901216686-ttdnashville.jpg", "publishtime": "2016-04-17T09:25:38.120000-05:00", "shorthed": "Train wreck: The price we pay for pandering", "articleid": 83030062, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/48dedab3e4b584cce1d82825c2ef9cc1370ce3da/c=0-52-506-338/local/-/media/2016/02/24/Nashville/Nashville/635919060901216686-ttdnashville.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/c81cb01dfba9f72f51af51aae7b4d1ed9ac002c0/c=215-0-404-338/local/-/media/2016/02/24/Nashville/Nashville/635919060901216686-ttdnashville.jpg"}}, "news_keywords": "Tennessee General Assembly, Insure Tennessee, Keel Hunt, Nashville news"}, "article_summary": "These are not the same thing, of course, and the legislature\u2019s rejection of Insure Tennessee demonstrates this point.\nHistory will note that Insure Tennessee came from their own governor.\nRIP, Insure Tennessee.\nOne-party government gets you peevish politics, slavish pandering to the loudest screamers, no backbone, no courage.\nBill Haslam\u2019s humanitarian proposal to extend Medicaid coverage to more than a quarter-million uninsured Tennesseans."}
