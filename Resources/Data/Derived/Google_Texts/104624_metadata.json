One particularly alarming trend among self-proclaimed members and supporters of ISIS online is the repeated use of images of young children to promote the cause.\n\nThe diversity of such online endeavors is bewildering and has posed a significant problem for social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter, which have struggled to ban the most violent and harrowing images surfacing from the groups\u2019 two warfronts in Iraq and Syria. There are many variations to ISIS\u2019 online promotional material\u2013from the celebratory photos of severed heads and burning cartons of cigarettes for being un-Islamic to Western-style memes using American coffins.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nPossibly fearing termination of their Twitter accounts, many ISIS supporters have begun posting their propaganda using the term \u201cDawlah\u201d for ISIS\u2013the Arabic word for \u201cstate.\u201d The \u201cDawlah\u201d hashtag on Twitter reveals a number of disturbing images of young children wielding automatic weapons and participating in ISIS rallies, used in an attempt to sell the image that ISIS is popular with children.\n\nA child leads a demonstration supporting #ISIS, wanting them to come back to #Idlib http://t.co/Fsne8EHSPN pic.twitter.com/0YYAIUVCb8 \u2014 ?? ????? #?????

Still, a cursory look at Facebook also uncovers the use of children in images meant to convey positive feelings towards Islamists globally:\n\nIn addition to being used for international propaganda campaigns, the Daily Mail reports that many of these children are made to fight and trained to kill. A recent video released by ISIS from Iraq shows children, appearing as young as eight years old, on the sidelines of a mass execution, forced to watch the adults do away with captured Iraqi soldiers.\n\nWhile ISIS continues to devastate much of northern Iraq, reports on the ground show that many Sunni Muslims, even those of Kurdish ethnicity, fear the antidote as much as they fear the poison. \u201cWe are more afraid of Iran than of ISIS,\u201d said one resident of Mosul to Spanish newspaper ABC, attempting to draw a line between ISIS, which kills indiscriminately, and \u201cSunni militias formed by tribes and Baathists,\u201d comprised mostly of locals and not jihadists imported from the warfront in Syria, as many ISIS jihadists are.\n\nAs ISIS continues its march towards Baghdad, its aggression in promoting its cause is likely to grow, even from the extreme heights such brutality has reached in images posted online. Images of children used as props and trained as soldiers are a stark reminder that ISIS\u2019 struggle against the West is not only a political one, and barely religious; it is a war of ideology and morality by a group determined to impose a morality in which such cardinal ethical transgressions are routine and proper.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Children Used as Props in Jihad", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Children Used as Props in Jihad", "title": "Children Used as Props in Jihad - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Big-Peace/2014/06/20/ISIS-child-tank.jpg", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2014/06/20/the-armed-children-of-isis-social-media-propaganda/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Children Used as Props in Jihad", "title": "Children Used as Props in Jihad - Breitbart", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Big-Peace/2014/06/20/ISIS-child-tank.jpg", "creator": "@francesmartel", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true", "app_id": 1243316582352556}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Iraq, ISIS, Twitter,National Security,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "National Security", "tag": "Twitter", "published_time": "2014-06-20T11:35:02-07:00", "categories": "National Security"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0896\"", "article_summary": "One particularly alarming trend among self-proclaimed members and supporters of ISIS online is the repeated use of images of young children to promote the cause.\nThere are many variations to ISIS\u2019 online promotional material\u2013from the celebratory photos of severed heads and burning cartons of cigarettes for being un-Islamic to Western-style memes using American coffins.\nStill, a cursory look at Facebook also uncovers the use of children in images meant to convey positive feelings towards Islamists globally:In addition to being used for international propaganda campaigns, the Daily Mail reports that many of these children are made to fight and trained to kill.\nImages of children used as props and trained as soldiers are a stark reminder that ISIS\u2019 struggle against the West is not only a political one, and barely religious; it is a war of ideology and morality by a group determined to impose a morality in which such cardinal ethical transgressions are routine and proper.\nA recent video released by ISIS from Iraq shows children, appearing as young as eight years old, on the sidelines of a mass execution, forced to watch the adults do away with captured Iraqi soldiers."}
