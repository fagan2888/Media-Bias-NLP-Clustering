They can carry a range of harmful bacteria and viruses, with the most known of them all being Lyme disease. One Boston man\u2019s recent experience with Lyme disease, however, exposes numerous holes in the U.S. health care system\u2019s ability to diagnose and treat the disease.\n\nAllen Bargfrede, an associate professor of music business at Berklee College of Music in Boston, became infected while in Spain for a conference. He had just gotten in the shower when he saw the tick on his ankle. \u201cI washed it off and didn\u2019t think about it anymore,\u201d he told Good Morning America. \u201cI remember thinking to myself, \u2018I hope I don\u2019t get sick from that.\u2019\u201d\n\nBut he did. Two days later, he found on his ankle the trademark sign of an initial infection: a bull\u2019s eye rash. He subsequently started experiencing symptoms of Lyme disease, including a fever, cough, and headaches. The headaches were strange, he said, causing \u201csevere anxiety.\u201d\n\nIt took 10 months for Bargfrede to find a doctor who would diagnose and treat him with the necessary antibiotics. The reason for this was because the American test for Lyme disease only tests for infection caused by the most common species of tick, called Borrelia burgdorferi. Additionally, doctors tend to suggest that the illness may be something else if tests come back negative.\n\nThe test, called ELISA (Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay), is followed with a Western blot, and both are used to test for antibodies trying to fight the Lyme infection. However, the infection can have a prolonged incubation period, making it even more difficult for results to come up positive. Experts say accuracy improves with the progression of the disease, as antibodies begin to appear \u2014 by that point the patient may already be suffering.\n\nWhat Bargfrede really needed was a C6-based ELISA test, which looks for infection caused by up to 18 species of ticks, including the one responsible for his illness, Borrelia garinii. He finally got the test, which is only provided in Europe, after a doctor who believed he had Lyme disease recommended he go back to Europe for tests. His test came back positive, but the doctor still wouldn\u2019t give him antibiotics on the basis that \u201che didn\u2019t believe the test.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll the while, I can\u2019t think straight, and can hardly get out of bed,\u201d he told GMA. \u201cI was fighting for my life and with my doctor.\u201d After trying other doctors \u2014 including one who wrongly prescribed him an IV (intravenous) solution of silver, which led to liver and kidney failure \u2014 he finally found one who would prescribe IV antibiotics. Finally, he was getting better.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s (CDC\u2019s) protocol for handling Lyme disease has been widely criticized. Add to that the availability of mostly unproven Lyme disease tests from various labs across the country, and it\u2019s apparent that these problems are not only complex but confusing for everyone. \u201cAn exemption in federal regulations allows many labs to offer Lyme tests without proof that they accurately identify the disease, leaving anxious patients and their doctors to decide which tests to believe,\u201d a report from the New England Center for Investigative Reporting said.\n\nBut with nearly 300,000 people becoming sick with Lyme disease every year, a set of cohesive steps is growing crucial. The CDC says that no other methods for diagnosis, such as DNA tests or blood tests, have been reliable yet. \u201cCertainly there is a lot of movement in terms of using [the c6-based ELISA test] more broadly in the U.S.,\u201d Dr. Paul Mead, chief of epidemiology and surveillance for the CDC\u2019s Lyme disease program, told GMA. \u201cWe are suggesting that as data becomes available to support that alternative, it would be a good possibility.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "mans, 10, month, lyme, disease, stint, exposes, holes, confusion, treating, it, us", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "It took 10 months of suffering before a Boston man discovered he had Lyme disease, since in the U.S., diagnostic tests aren't the most reliable.", "title": "Man's 10-Month Lyme Disease Stint Shows How Confusing It Is To Treat", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/mans-10-month-lyme-disease-stint-exposes-holes-confusion-treating-it-us-291944", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/07/08/tick.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "It took 10 months of suffering before a Boston man discovered he had Lyme disease, since in the U.S., diagnostic tests aren't the most reliable.", "title": "Man's 10-Month Lyme Disease Stint Shows How Confusing It Is To Treat", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/mans-10-month-lyme-disease-stint-exposes-holes-confusion-treating-it-us-291944", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/07/08/tick.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/07/08/tick.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2014-07-08T15:23:09-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-07-08T15:23:08-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "It took 10 months of suffering before a Boston man discovered he had Lyme disease, since in the U.S., diagnostic tests aren't the most reliable."}, "article_summary": "One Boston man\u2019s recent experience with Lyme disease, however, exposes numerous holes in the U.S. health care system\u2019s ability to diagnose and treat the disease.\nThey can carry a range of harmful bacteria and viruses, with the most known of them all being Lyme disease.\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s (CDC\u2019s) protocol for handling Lyme disease has been widely criticized.\nHe subsequently started experiencing symptoms of Lyme disease, including a fever, cough, and headaches.\nBut with nearly 300,000 people becoming sick with Lyme disease every year, a set of cohesive steps is growing crucial."}
