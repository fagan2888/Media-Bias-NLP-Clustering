No more than 15 to 20 percent can be spent on administrative costs.\n\nInsurers that fail to meet the standard owe policyholders a refund. Refunds are paid directly to consumers who purchase their own insurance or to employers for company-sponsored plans, and the companies then forward the rebates to their workers.\n\nUnited Healthcare is responsible for the majority of the rebates \u2013 $4.1 million for small-group policies and $777,000 for large-group policies \u2013 for missing the guidelines in 2014. Coventry Health and Life Insurance owes about $833,000 in refunds, while CIGNA owes almost $589,000.\n\nOther companies owing refunds in North Carolina include Golden Rules Insurance, Connecticut General Life Insurance, Mid-West Life Insurance and Madison National Life Insurance.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30;polling-uri=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wral.com/rss/48&id=1;polling-uri2=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wral.com/rss/48&id=2;polling-uri3=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wral.com/rss/48&id=3;polling-uri4=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wral.com/rss/48&id=4;polling-uri5=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wral.com/rss/48&id=5;cycle=1", "dcterms.created": "2015-11-23 15:08:27", "description": "Health insurers will have to give $8.5 million in premiums back to individual and business customers for failing to meet requirements of the Affordable Care Act, state Insurance Commissioner Wayne Goodwin said Monday.", "application-name": "WRAL.com", "dcterms.modified": "2015-11-23 15:08:27", "outbrain": {"ob_desc": "id_asset=15131357|asset_type=story"}, "twitter": {"description": "Health insurers will have to give $8.5 million in premiums back to individual and business customers for failing to meet requirements of the Affordable Care Act, state Insurance Commissioner Wayne Goodwin said Monday.", "title": "NC consumers to get $8.5M in health insurance rebates :: WRAL.com", "url": "http://www.wral.com/nc-consumers-to-get-8-5m-in-health-insurance-rebates/15131357/", "image": "http://wwwcache.wral.com/asset/lifestyles/healthteam/2013/11/18/13127675/13127675-1426881544-160x120.jpg", "site": "@wral", "card": "summary"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#041E30", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "/favicons/mstile-70x70.png", "robots": "index,follow", "pinterest": "nohover", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "/favicons/mstile-310x310.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "/favicons/mstile-310x150.png", "fb": {"app_id": 334167666672300}, "author": "WRAL", "article": {"published_time": "2015-11-23T15:08:27-05:00"}, "msapplication-square150x150logo": "/favicons/mstile-150x150.png", "og": {"site_name": "WRAL.com", "description": "Health insurers will have to give $8.5 million in premiums back to individual and business customers for failing to meet requirements of the Affordable Care Act, state Insurance Commissioner Wayne Goodwin said Monday.", "title": "NC consumers to get $8.5M in health insurance rebates :: WRAL.com", "url": "http://www.wral.com/nc-consumers-to-get-8-5m-in-health-insurance-rebates/15131357/", "image": "http://wwwcache.wral.com/asset/lifestyles/healthteam/2013/11/18/13127675/13127675-1426881544-646x485.jpg", "type": "article"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "msapplication-TileImage": "/favicons/mstile-144x144.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2554\"", "article_summary": "Other companies owing refunds in North Carolina include Golden Rules Insurance, Connecticut General Life Insurance, Mid-West Life Insurance and Madison National Life Insurance.\nCoventry Health and Life Insurance owes about $833,000 in refunds, while CIGNA owes almost $589,000.\nUnited Healthcare is responsible for the majority of the rebates \u2013 $4.1 million for small-group policies and $777,000 for large-group policies \u2013 for missing the guidelines in 2014.\nUnder the federal health law, insurers must spend at least 80 percent of their premium revenue \u2013 85 percent for large-group policies \u2013 on paying medical claims and improving the quality of health care for customers.\nRefunds are paid directly to consumers who purchase their own insurance or to employers for company-sponsored plans, and the companies then forward the rebates to their workers."}
