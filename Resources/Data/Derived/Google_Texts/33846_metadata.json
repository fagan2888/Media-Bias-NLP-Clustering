He grew up on a farm in rural Yell County, Arkansas, before he graduated from Harvard magna cum laude and from Harvard Law. Then, he volunteered for the infantry. An Army Ranger, he did stints in Iraq and Afghanistan, earning a Bronze Star.\n\nThe conservative media swoons, too. Breitbart.com once called him \u201cone of the best candidates running for Congress this election cycle\u2014and possibly ever.\u201d Karl Rove\u2019s American Crossroads anointed him \u201ca conservative leader and rock-star candidate,\u201d and the National Review, which once did a four-part hagiography on Cotton, concluded that \u201che seems to have it all.\u201d Ubiquitous GOP neocon-sigliere Bill Kristol is Cotton\u2019s No. 1 fan, gushing about a \u201cbond beyond pure policy\u201d and, yes, mentioning Cotton among a couple of dozen possible \u201916 candidates. Kristol\u2019s Weekly Standard has been an efficient factory churning out dozens of gushing items since Cotton emerged on the scene\u2014best read, Dave Weigel suggested, \u201cwhile listening to John Phillip Sousa and cooling an apple pie.\u201d\n\nBeyond the resum\u00e9, Cotton adroitly bridges the contentious factions within the party. His Tea Party bona fides are unquestioned; he is popular with the Republican establishment; and he has big money backing from K Street, from mega-donors like Sheldon Alderson and from right-wing advocacy groups like Heritage Action and, most prolifically, the Club for Growth. As Ed Kilgore put it last fall, while vainly hoping Arkansas voters might quash Cotton\u2019s rise: \u201c[H]e manages to be a True Believer in the most important tenets of all the crucial Republican factions. He\u2019s adored by Neocons, the Republican Establishment, the Tea Folk, the Christian Right, and most of all by the Con-Con cognoscenti that draw from both these last two categories.\u201d\n\nCrucially, Cotton has no major apostasy to rattle the Tea Party faithful. Most 2016 contenders have their vulnerabilities: Bush (immigration and education), Marco Rubio (immigration), Chris Christie (any number of policies and choice of photo-op partner). Governors like Mike Pence of Indiana and John Kasich of Ohio advocated for Medicaid expansion in their states, an unforgiveable surrender to Obamacare among Tea Party activists. Meanwhile, Cotton scrupulously avoided taking a position on the privatized version of Medicaid expansion in Arkansas, calling it a \u201cstate-based issue.\" Like his hedging on the state\u2019s minimum wage ballot initiative, Cotton used rhetorical triangulation during the campaign against Pryor without ever doing anything to sully his right-wing scorecards. Cotton\u2019s relative political inexperience is a strength: His short record as a True Conservative is squeaky clean.\n\nCotton would be well-positioned to run to the right of Bush or Romney\u2014or for that matter, almost anyone. He cast himself as an outlier even from the Arkansas Republican delegation when he voted against the Farm Bill (the \u201cFood Stamp Bill,\u201d Cotton called it) and against disaster relief (\u201cI don\u2019t think Arkansas needs to bail out the northeast,\u201d he said when he voted against the Hurricane Sandy Disaster Relief Bill). He voted for the Republican Study Committee Budget\u2014sort of a Paul Ryan Budget on steroids that would eventually raise to 70 the eligibility age for Social Security and Medicare\u2014and during the shutdown fight last year, he voted against the omnibus appropriations bill that kept the government running. During the debate over raising the debt ceiling, he called a potential national default \u201cshort-term market corrections,\u201d saying, \u201cI\u2019d like to take the medicine now.\"\n\nDouthat\u2019s framework raises the question of whether Cotton would be too conservative for the GOP primary. For someone that far right to win the nomination, Douthat writes, a candidate would need to capture \u201csecular conservatives plus religious conservatives to start, and then just enough moderate conservatives to win.\u201d A candidate would have to present himself as palatable and electable, persuade donors that he was a winner, and broaden his appeal.\n\nThis would almost certainly be an easier path for Cotton than for, say, Ted Cruz, who has led noisy tactical grandstanding and public fights with GOP leadership, making enemies among Republican elites. One of the intriguing Senate subplots this year will be where Cotton positions himself in the GOP's intraparty squabbles over tactics, particularly with respect to Cruz, a far-right fellow traveler who could become a national political rival.\n\nMake no mistake, Cotton is a rigid ideologue. But while his votes may track with a flamethrower like Cruz, Cotton\u2019s mannered, upright style contrasts with the bombastic figures who might excite the base while putting off moderates. Cotton votes with the \u201chell-no caucus,\u201d but his public persona is more like \u201cNo, sir.\u201d His cheers from the Tea Party and the near-perfect scorecard from Heritage haven\u2019t hurt his standing among the Republican establishment and moderate conservatives who regard him as a star in the making. He\u2019s \u201cthe last, best hope for GOP hawks,\u201d as Politico put it when Cotton first eyed a Senate run. Cotton\u2019s neocon cred, along with that biography Republican consultant Ralph Reed deemed \u201cout of central casting,\u201d gets him entr\u00e9e to many establishment circles beyond the reach of Tea Party firebrands. In a GOP primary, he could rally the base without positioning himself as an insurgent in a Cruz mold.\n\nOn national security, Cotton is radically different from another Tea Party favorite, Sen. Rand Paul. The Kentucky senator hopes to reorient GOP foreign policy, arguing for less intervention, more diplomacy, more congressional oversight, more stringent legal limits on surveillance and drone strikes, and ultimately a reduction in spending. Cotton, by contrast, has been called the \u201cparty\u2019s most aggressive next-generation advocate for military action overseas.\u201d For Cotton, the Iraq War was a \u201cjust and noble war\u201d; on foreign policy, he has said, \u201cGeorge Bush largely did have it right.\u201d Cotton argues for an aggressive, interventionist military posture abroad, more defense spending, and an executive branch empowered on matters of national security. Pick a topic\u2014Syria, Iran, Russia, ISIS, drones, NSA snooping\u2014and Cotton can be found at the hawkish outer edge of the debate, demanding a continuation or escalation of the Cheney line more consistently and vociferously than nearly any of his peers. (During his senate campaign, he told a tele-townhall that ISIS and Mexican drug cartels joining forces to attack Arkansas was \u201can urgent problem.\")\n\nPaul and Cotton, in other words, are heading for a showdown. Zack Beauchamp at Vox called it the battle for \u201cthe GOP\u2019s foreign policy soul.\u201d Paul\u2019s clever gambit has been to frame his critique of neoconservatives as an attack on Obama, hoping to woo Tea Party support. Cotton, unimpeachably right-wing on every issue, doesn't have to angle for credibility with Tea Party voters in the \"soul\" fight. (Cotton was even willing to risk backing Obama to advance the neocon position on Syria.) Moreover, Cotton hasn\u2019t been shy about using his recent military experience as a trump card when arguing to continuously ratchet up the War on Terror.\n\nAny discussion of a primary that could draw a dozen candidates is necessarily an oversimplification. (Don\u2019t forget Rick Perry, Bobby Jindal, Scott Walker, Mike Huckabee, Rick Santorum.) Pragmatic GOP voters, or what\u2019s left of them, may decide a national general-election campaign would bring Cotton's weaknesses to the fore. His public persona can be awkward or stiff (\u201cI\u2019m warm, dammit,\u201d he once joked to Politico) and his adherence to talking points can veer toward the robotic. Plus, Democratic strategists would have no trouble portraying Cotton's voting record as extreme.\n\nBut Cotton would scramble a GOP primary in unpredictable ways. Stylistically he would be an elite/establishment Republican; he would bow to no one in military enthusiasm and dedication to Tea Party economics; he would pass muster with religious conservatives. If he were to captivate the foreign policy hardliners and the anti-food stamp spendthrifts, and woo Republican kingmakers to help him in the invisible primary, he might peel off moderates who smell a winner.\n\nA Cotton run would ignite two big questions. Will the GOP remain a party of bellicose hawks? And is the party ready to put a candidate who fully champions Tea Party domestic policies on top of the ticket? He may be a long shot to run in 2016, but an eventual run for higher office seems inevitable. He has been training for the role of picture-perfect conservative. If GOP voters decide to turn to the bench early, they may start clamoring for young Tom Cotton.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "//assets.newrepublic.com/assets/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "In a post last September, New York Times columnist Ross Douthat wrote about the path to victory in a potentially wide-open GOP primary: \u201c[Y]ou want to seem conservative enough&nbsp;but not too right-wing, electable but not a liberal sellout, a safe choice for donors who also makes the party\u2019s activists feel respected...
