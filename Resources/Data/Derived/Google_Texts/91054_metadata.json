To be sure, I\u2019m not the first person to make this argument and Ginsburg has publicly pushed back on talk of her leaving. What\u2019s changed in recent weeks, however, are new poll numbers that suggest Democrats are at very real risk of losing their majority in the Senate. While such an outcome next fall would be demoralizing for Democrats, it wouldn\u2019t have much of a policy impact. No matter who controls the Senate, House Republicans are hardly leaping at the opportunity to work with President Obama. It would, however, make it much harder for Democrats to fill the judiciary with progressive judges\u2026 Considering that Harry Reid was forced to employ the nuclear option against the filibuster to get Obama\u2019s lower court judges past Senate GOP obstruction tactics, does anyone really doubt that Republicans would block Obama\u2019s supreme court nominees? Unlike today where Republicans would have to take the unprecedented step of using the filibuster to stop a potential nominee, a GOP-controlled Senate could simply vote one down with a 51-vote majority. Democrats would have little recourse to stop them.\n\nLiberals have bitter memories of watching the Court\u2019s lefty lions wait too long and then end up being replaced by Republican appointees. William Brennan tried to outlast 12 years of Republican presidents in the 1980s but finally stepped down in 1990. His replacement, David Souter, worked out okay for the left. Thurgood Marshall followed a year later. His replacement, Clarence Thomas, didn\u2019t.\n\nAs such, ever since election day 2012, they\u2019ve wanted their elder statesmen on the Court to make way sooner rather than later. Because of two developments over the past six months, they now need them out much sooner. Thanks to ObamaCare, the GOP\u2019s odds of taking back the Senate have risen, and thanks to Harry Reid, Democrats no longer have to worry about the current Republican minority filibustering a cloture vote on a SCOTUS nominee. (Technically, although it\u2019s been stripped away for lower court appointments, the right to filibuster remains in effect for Supreme Court confirmations. Reid won\u2019t wait five minutes to nuke that part of it too, though, once a SCOTUS vacancy opens up.) If you want to get a young, radically liberal judge rubber-stamped by 51 Democrats, now is the time.\n\nBut based on what Ginsburg told Reuters last July, she\u2019s not going anywhere:\n\nBrushing off political calculations, she said, \u201cIt really has to be, \u2018Am I equipped to do the job?\u2019 \u2026 I was so pleased that this year I couldn\u2019t see that I was slipping in any respect.\u201d She said she remains energized by her work as the senior liberal, a position she has held since 2010 when Justice John Paul Stevens retired, and calls being a justice \u201cthe best job in the world for a lawyer.\u201d She has previously said she wanted her tenure to at least match the nearly 23 years of Justice Louis Brandeis, which would get her to April 2016, and said she had a new \u201cmodel\u201d in Justice Stevens, who retired at age 90 after nearly 35 years on the bench. Reinforcing the message that she might not leave before her health requires it, she mused of another former colleague, \u201cI wonder if Sandra regrets stepping down when she did?\u201d\n\nThree points here in response to Cohen. One: Although Democrats have a freer hand now to approve a new liberal appointee than they\u2019ve had in years, midterm politics will provide some restraint on Obama, needless to say. Landrieu, Pryor, and the rest of the red-state gang already have a heavy burden to shoulder; having the White House try to ram through a radical progressive will make it heavier. If Ginsburg has a change of heart and wants to make it easy on team Democrat, she\u2019ll aim for the lame-duck session.\n\nTwo: Obama can and will still get a SCOTUS nominee past a Republican-controlled Senate, even if/when the new majority leader reinstates the filibuster rules to bring the cloture threshold back to 60. Congress won\u2019t allow the Supreme Court to operate for years with eight justices. Some sort of deal will be struck, possibly involving a new Senate \u201cgang\u201d (groan), to fill the vacancy. The trade-off for O will be that he\u2019ll have to appoint someone who\u2019s nominally further towards the center than he\u2019d like, but that\u2019s okay. When was the last time a Democratic justice broke with the pack on any major decision? They\u2019re bench is entirely liberal. Some of them are simply more scrupulous about hiding it than others.\n\nThree: Cohen\u2019s overselling the possibility of a Republican president appointing someone in 2017 and having him/her confirmed by a Republican Senate. I know I\u2019ve linked it before but here again is Sean Trende\u2019s odds of the Democrats retaking (or holding) the Senate in 2016. They\u2019re sky high, just because there are so many vulnerable GOP incumbents who happen to be up that year. Factor in the certainty of higher Democratic turnout in a presidential election year and everything\u2019s in their favor. Odds are that President Jeb Bush or Ted Cruz would have to get his first nominee past a majority from the other party \u2014 and Republicans know it, which is yet another incentive for them to forge some sort of \u201cgang\u201d for 2015-16. If they\u2019re willing to approve a centrist-y Obama nominee over the last two years of his term, Democratic \u201cgang\u201d members will need to approve a centrist-y nominee from the next Republican president in 2017-18.\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "Appointments.", "title": "So, how many Supreme Court retirements will there be this year?", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2014/02/14/so-how-many-supreme-court-retirements-will-there-be-this-year/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "article": {"published_time": "2014-02-14T22:21:46+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-02-14T22:27:19+00:00"}, "keywords": "appointment, brennan, breyer, cohen, ginsburg, marshall, Supreme Court,", "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "article_summary": "(Technically, although it\u2019s been stripped away for lower court appointments, the right to filibuster remains in effect for Supreme Court confirmations.\nSo, how many Supreme Court retirements will there be this year?\nCongress won\u2019t allow the Supreme Court to operate for years with eight justices.\nThree: Cohen\u2019s overselling the possibility of a Republican president appointing someone in 2017 and having him/her confirmed by a Republican Senate.\nNo matter who controls the Senate, House Republicans are hardly leaping at the opportunity to work with President Obama."}
