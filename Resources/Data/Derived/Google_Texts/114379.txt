Jurors have found a Glenpool grandmother charged with possession of and manufacturing child pornography guilty.

The Tulsa County jury returned its verdict Friday evening.

The district attorney's office said the jurors recommended a total sentence of 25 years in prison on both counts.

Prosecutors say Sally Deupree met Ricky Lewis on Craigslist and received from him nude photos of a 2-year-old girl and asked Lewis to make a child porn video and send it to her. No video was ever found, but photos were.

At Deupree's trial, Lewis testified she knew he had problems with child porn and never reported it, and bailed him out of jail after his first arrest.

Deupree's attorney argued his client only agreed with Lewis because she was in love with him.

Ricky Lewis was sent to prison for 60 years after pleading guilty in April.

Sentencing for Deupree is set for October 14.

The year-long case also involves another woman.

Brittany Dick is already spending 51 years in prison, after admitting that she sent the same man a nude photo of her 2-year-old daughter.
