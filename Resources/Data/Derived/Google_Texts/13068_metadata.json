Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), a longtime opponent of the bill.\n\nDonald \u201cD\u201d Taylor, the general president of the Las Vegas-based UNITE HERE, met with the Senate Minority leader for a private meeting Tuesday that reportedly touched on the union\u2019s grievances with President Obama\u2019s signature health care law, according to the Las Vegas Review Journal.\n\nMcConnell confirmed that the two met in the nation\u2019s capital, adding that it was Taylor who requested the get-together.\n\n\u201cIt was a fairly brief meeting but it\u2019s safe to say this is a good example of some of the president\u2019s union constituents who were very enthusiastically for him who think Obamacare has been a disaster for them,\u201d McConnell said after the meeting.\n\nThe Kentucky Republican added that Taylor did not get into the specifics of his complaints against the Affordable Care Act, but he said the meeting was an \u201cexchange of pleasantries.\u201d\n\nA spokeswoman for the union leader told the Review Journal Tuesday that Taylor had indeed travelled to the nation\u2019s capital, but she would not confirm if he had additional meetings in Washington.\n\nTaylor did not meet with Senate Majority Leader and Obamacare supporter Sen. Harry Reid (D-Nev.), a spokesperson with the senator\u2019s office confirmed.\n\nWhen asked about Taylor\u2019s Obamacare complaints, the Senate Majority Leader replied: \u201cI\u2019ll talk with D.\u201d\n\nThe union leader\u2019s visit to the nation\u2019s capital comes weeks after him and Terry O\u2019Sullivan of the Laborers\u2019 International Union of America complained in a letter to Reid and Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) that the White House has been ignoring their Obamacare complaints.\n\nLabor leaders are upset that the Affordable Care Act doesn\u2019t offer benefits or subsidies that would help offset the cost to workers\u2019 union-negotiated plans.\n\nAnd contrary to earlier reports, these concerns have not been addressed by the Obama administration, Taylor and O\u2019Sullivan said in their letter to Pelosi and Reid.\n\n\u201cIf the administration honestly thinks that these proposed rules are responsive to our concerns, they were not listening or they simply did not care,\u201d the union leaders said. \u201cIt would be a sad irony indeed if the signature legislative accomplishment for an administration committed to reducing income inequality cut living standards for middle income and low-wage workers.\u201d\n\nTaylor added in an interview last week with the Washington Post: \u201cWe want to hold the president to his word: If you like your health-care coverage, you can keep it, and that just hasn\u2019t been the case.\u201d\n\n\u2013\n\nFollow Becket Adams (@BecketAdams) on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30; polling-uri=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/1.xml; polling-uri2=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/2.xml; polling-uri3=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/3.xml; polling-uri4=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/4.xml", "application-name": "TheBlaze.com", "twitter": {"description": "The chief of the national hotel workers union is \u201cbitterly disappointed\u201d with the Affordable Care Act -- and he decided this week to meet with Sen.
