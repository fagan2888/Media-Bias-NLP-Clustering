NORWICH, England (AP) - Xherdan Shaqiri had an assist on his debut to help Stoke earn a 1-1 draw at Norwich on Saturday in the Premier League.

Shaqiri, who looked lively throughout, set up Mame Biram Diouf for Stoke’s opener in the 11th minute before Russell Martin equalized for the hosts in the 28th.

The Switzerland international became Stoke’s record signing when he joined from Inter Milan for 12 million pounds ($18.8 million) and was given his first start on the right wing by manager Mark Hughes.

His free kick was headed in by Diouf before Martin levelled with a shot between the legs of goalkeeper Jack Butland. It was Butland who rescued a point for Stoke in the second half, making saves from Graham Dorrans, Cameron Jerome and Nathan Redmond.
