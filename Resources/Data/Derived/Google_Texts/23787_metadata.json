Frank Pallone Jr.\n\nAnd the beneficiary was Rep. Frank Pallone of Monmouth County, who defeated a friend of Pelosi\u2019s, Rep. Anna Eshoo of California, to become the top-ranking Democrat on the Energy and Commerce Committee.\n\nThe secret vote in the Democratic caucus was 100-90, and came a day after Pelosi was reelected minority leader without opposition. Pelosi had publicly endorsed Eshoo, saying the representative of Silicon Valley would provide new vision on the committee.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a solid rebuke to Pelosi,\u201d said Ross Baker, a Rutgers University political scientist. \u201cThere\u2019s an undercurrent of discontent with her leadership, but it\u2019s very unfashionable to express it publicly against the first woman to be speaker of the House.\u201d\n\nPallone also benefitted from his record as a party soldier and vigorous defender of the Affordable Care Act, his ability to raise money and spread it around to colleagues, and his seniority over Eshoo on the committee. With the two most senior Democrats retiring, Pallone was third and Eshoo was fifth.\n\n\u201cThis is good for New Jersey,\u201d said Rep. Bill Pascrell Jr., D-Paterson, who helped Pallone line up votes. \u201cIt\u2019s a very prestigious committee, and Frank\u2019s worked hard since he\u2019s been in Congress.\u201d\n\nThe committee\u2019s jurisdiction includes health insurance, food and drug regulations, telecommunications and some environmental policy.\n\nIn a statement, Pallone said he was \u201chumbled\u201d by the outcome.\n\n\u201cI am committed to developing real solutions to challenges that average Americans face, while building an agenda that will make our party stronger for years to come,\u201d Pallone said.\n\nOf the $1.6 million Pallone spent through Oct. 15 from his reelection campaign account, $805,000 went to other candidates, including $270,000 to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. Pallone had also spent another $3 million last year on an unsuccessful bid for U.S. Senate.\n\nAfter Democrats lost at least a dozen seats on Nov. 4, Pascrell had called for Pelosi to postpone leadership elections to allow time for an in-depth examination of what happened and where the party needed to go next year.\n\n\u201cIt really shows there\u2019s kick in our rank-and-file, that were not going to be led by the nose,\u201d Pascrell said of Pallone\u2019s win.\n\nA committee\u2019s ranking minority member is often consulted on hearings and can pick some witnesses. When legislation is being considered, the ranking member has a say in which amendments the minority party will offer.\n\nPallone, who was first elected in 1988, has headed the House Democrats\u2019 messaging operation, which involves lining up members to give speeches on topics the party wants to stress at the start of sessions.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not a job that everybody wants to have, but Pallone was regarded as the ultimate good soldier among House Democrats, and he picked up a lot of credit for that,\u201d Baker said.\n\nEmail: jackson@northjersey.com Blog: northjersey.com/thepoliticalstate\n\n", "article_metadata": {"apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "description": "A close election for a leadership post on a powerful committee became an outlet for House Democrats to vent unhappiness with Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi on Wednesday.", "copyright": "North Jersey Media Group Inc.", "author": "HERB JACKSON", "og": {"url": "http://www.northjersey.com/cm/2.1593/news/pallone-gains-top-house-committee-post-1.1136719", "site_name": "NorthJersey.com", "image": "http://www.northjersey.com:80/polopoly_fs/1.569892!/fileImage/httpImage/071813pallone-dngnk.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "A close election for a leadership post on a powerful committee became an outlet for House Democrats to vent unhappiness with Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi on Wednesday."}, "title": "Pallone gains top House committee post", "robots": "noarchive,noodp,noydir", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=446490632", "fb": {"admins": "100002050123125,739916158,1235266096", "app_id": 130358300392751}, "DC.creator": "HERB JACKSON", "msvalidate.01": "697A26605161B513EFE2AD6E581F4AA8", "google-site-verification": "swyvR_LXSGMOxOz1638gujs38OoVP3sZwJgdjySjnXM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=2.0, user-scalable=yes", "DC.title": "Pallone gains top House committee post"}, "article_summary": "A close election for a leadership post on a powerful committee became an outlet for House Democrats to vent unhappiness with Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi on Wednesday.\nWhen legislation is being considered, the ranking member has a say in which amendments the minority party will offer.\nRep.
