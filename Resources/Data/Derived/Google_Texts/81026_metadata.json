And the more small companies \u2013 without the wherewithal to similarly rig \u2013 suffer.\n\nThe long-term, permanent solution is to reduce the size, scope and sphere of influence of government. The less government tries to micromanage things \u2013 the more it steps back and lets the private sector do its magical goodness \u2013 the better off we all are.\n\nIn the meantime, may we please at least stop the government busy-bodying that is so bad even the busybodies in question acknowledge its absurdity?\n\nDish Network Surprise Winner In Spectrum Auction\n\nIn what appeared to be an unprecedented move, Dish also secured all of its winning bids through entities that qualified for a 25% discount set aside by the Federal Communications Commission for small businesses. As a result, Dish and its partners will only owe about $10 billion, saving more than $3 billion\u2026.\n\nWait \u2013 what set asides?\n\nFCC to Set Aside Spectrum for Smaller Wireless Firms\n\nFederal regulators plan to set aside a portion of choice spectrum for smaller wireless carriers at an auction of TV airwaves scheduled for next year\u2026.\n\n\n\nAccording to people familiar with the matter, the Federal Communications Commission plans to reserve a portion of that spectrum to prevent the two largest wireless carriers (Verizon and AT&T) from purchasing it all.\n\nWait \u2013 I thought an auction was\u2026an auction. Everyone can participate and bid \u2013 and the highest bids win.\n\nBut this isn\u2019t Reality \u2013 this is GovernmentLand. In GovernmentLand, bureaucrats try to warp reality to meet their perverse worldview. It\u2019s unfair that successful entities are successful \u2013 government must rig the system against them.\n\nYet again, government isn\u2019t picking winners and losers \u2013 it\u2019s picking losers at the expense of winners.\n\nExcept Dish isn\u2019t a loser \u2013 and it certainly isn\u2019t small. It\u2019s currently worth $17.9 billion. Not exactly the Little Guy for whom government was trying to rig the game. And that\u2019s the point.\n\nThe road to Hell is paved with good government intentions. Its attempts at making things \u201cfair\u201d nearly always fail \u2013 miserably. Big companies can always find a way around whatever attempts at \u201cfairness\u201d government makes.\n\nDish has said it followed all of the auction\u2019s rules\u2026.\n\nDish probably did. And that\u2019s the point.\n\nAnd no matter how many times bureaucrats fail at micromanaging \u2013 no matter how many times the private sector eats their lunch \u2013 each and every time they are surprised anew.\n\nRegulators May Reject Dish Entities\u2019 Spectrum Discount Claims\n\nShortly after the auction wrapped up, (Federal Communications Commission) FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler told the commission\u2019s staff to study SNR and Northstar\u2019s (the two Dish front companies) applications closely, and told the staff that he thought something didn\u2019t smell right, one of the people said.\n\nGet that? Government sets up stupid rules. Company adheres to their letter \u2013 while eviscerating the ridiculous spirit. Government then unilaterally undoes the legal result it ham-handedly created.\n\nHow\u2019s that for economic and marketplace certainty?\n\nLook, the government should pull the plug on Dish\u2019s purchases \u2013 as a way to unwind the inanity of its own making. We the Consumers are best served by the best winning \u2013 not those winning by best rigging the system.\n\nAnd going forward, rather than government yet again breaking the private sector and then having to attempt to repair it \u2013 just leave it alone.\n\nIt is under those unfettered circumstances that things always go best.\n\n[Originally published at Red State]", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://blog.heartland.org/2015/05/government-tries-to-micromanage-a-market-and-yet-again-fails-miserably/", "type": "activity", "image": "http://blog.heartland.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/regulationsmaze.jpg", "site_name": "Somewhat Reasonable", "title": "Government Tries to Micromanage a Market \u2013 And Yet Again Fails Miserably"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "Except Dish isn\u2019t a loser \u2013 and it certainly isn\u2019t small.\nThe less government tries to micromanage things \u2013 the more it steps back and lets the private sector do its magical goodness \u2013 the better off we all are.\nWe the Consumers are best served by the best winning \u2013 not those winning by best rigging the system.\nThe bigger government is \u2013 the more room there is for big companies who wish to do so to rig the system.\nWait \u2013 I thought an auction was\u2026an auction."}
