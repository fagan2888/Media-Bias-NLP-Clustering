It\u2019s freedom of religion and freedom of speech, and we will all be up there,\u201d Olsen said. \u201cBut are they really putting them up to wish everyone a happy holiday from the atheists and the Satanists, or are they up there to protest baby Jesus?\u201d\n\nOlsen told the Democrat that she rejects the idea that displays representing religious holidays in the Capitol are examples of \u201cgovernment-sponsored religion.\u201d\n\n\u201cFreedom of religion\u2026 makes America great,\u201d said Olsen. \u201cOur heart is not to cause any contention; it\u2019s simply to say Merry Christmas. It\u2019s really important that people understand that.\u201d\n\nThe Democrat reports that signs accompany the displays in the rotunda with the disclaimer \u201cThe State of Florida does not endorse or sponsor the views expressed by persons or displays in this area.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Times-Union, \u201cThe state agency offered no explanation with its approval of the displays.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The temple\u2019s display depicts a falling angel about to be engulfed in the fires of Hell.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The temple\u2019s display depicts a falling angel about to be engulfed in the fires of Hell.", "title": "Satanic Temple Display Approved for the Florida Capitol's Holiday Decorations", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/141204_SatanicTemple_Scanlon.png", "updated_time": "2014-12-04T23:08:10+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1wAlQwu"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The temple\u2019s display depicts a falling angel about to be engulfed in the fires of Hell.", "title": "Satanic Temple Display Approved for the Florida Capitol's Holiday Decorations", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/141204_SatanicTemple_Scanlon.png"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Society", "tag": "religious liberty", "published_time": "2014-12-04T17:39:59+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-12-04T23:08:10+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "satanic temple florida ,Lucien Greaves, Pam Olsen, Florida prayer network,  Freedom from Religion Foundation,"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbf6e\"", "article_summary": "The Florida Department of Management Services recently approved an application for a holiday display from the Satanic Temple despite rejecting the same group\u2019s \u201cgrossly offensive\u201d display last year, according to the Florida Times-Union.\nVisitors to the Florida Capitol building this holiday season will be treated to a festive display of\u2026 a Satanic Temple.\nThe Florida Prayer Network and the International House of Prayer Tallahassee will display Nativity scenes.\n\u201cThe Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster,\u201d which \u201cworships\u201d a plate of spaghetti and meatballs, was also approved for a display in the Capitol.\nIncluding the temple, a few other proposed displays will join the traditional Hanukkah menorah and Christmas trees in the first-floor rotunda of the Capitol."}
