That\u2019s not the lowest price Minnesota motorists have seen at the pump this year, however. Regular gas briefly dipped below $2 per gallon in January and peaked in late July at $2.79.\n\nNationally, average gasoline prices are at their lowest point for a Labor Day weekend since 2004, a result of low oil prices and a quiet hurricane season that has allowed Gulf Coast refineries to churn out fuel. Crude oil prices have plunged because producers are still furiously pumping oil.\n\nTara Albaugh had several reasons to smile when she filled the tank of her band-new Dodge Grand Caravan for the very first time Friday.\n\nHer two young children love the new minivan. Their trips around town have been \u201cjoy rides.\u201d And the price of gas was $2.39 per gallon at the Minnoco in her Minneapolis neighborhood.\n\n\u201cAnytime I see a price that begins with a 2 I am happy, and it\u2019s really nice to see it below $2.50,\u201d Albaugh said as she pumped the cheap fuel.\n\nLow prices are expected to stay around for a while, barring unexpected disruption, such as a refinery outage. Two weeks ago, BP restored its giant Whiting, Indiana, refinery to full production, ending an outage that had caused prices to spike in Chicago and that sent ripples as far as Minnesota.\n\nPatrick DeHaan, an oil analyst for GasBuddy, told the Star Tribune (http://strib.mn/1Kxkdaz ) that Minnesota prices could dip below $2 per gallon by late December.\n\nGasoline demand typically drops after Labor Day as summer travel season winds down, keeping downward pressure on prices even as refineries cut output to perform maintenance.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Star Tribune, http://www.startribune.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "Low gasoline prices for Labor Day weekend have taken a load off Minnesota motorists' wallets as they make their final summer trips and send their kids off to college.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Low gasoline prices for Labor Day weekend have taken a load off Minnesota motorists\u2019 wallets as they make their final summer trips and send their kids off to college.", "title": "Minnesota motorists see relief at gas pumps for Labor Day", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/sep/5/low-labor-day-gas-prices-take-load-off-minnesotans/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/09/05/71f9b664ed952c27810f6a7067004dd6.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/09/05/71f9b664ed952c27810f6a7067004dd6.jpg", "description": "Low gasoline prices for Labor Day weekend have taken a load off Minnesota motorists' wallets as they make their final summer trips and send their kids off to college.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Minnesota motorists see relief at gas pumps for Labor Day"}, "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd14d\"", "article_summary": "That\u2019s not the lowest price Minnesota motorists have seen at the pump this year, however.\nMINNEAPOLIS (AP) - Low gasoline prices for Labor Day weekend have taken a load off Minnesota motorists\u2019 wallets as they make their final summer trips and send their kids off to college.\nGasoline demand typically drops after Labor Day as summer travel season winds down, keeping downward pressure on prices even as refineries cut output to perform maintenance.\nCrude oil prices have plunged because producers are still furiously pumping oil.\nNationally, average gasoline prices are at their lowest point for a Labor Day weekend since 2004, a result of low oil prices and a quiet hurricane season that has allowed Gulf Coast refineries to churn out fuel."}
