Her legislation was blocked from being made part of NDAA in the final days of the 113th Congress.\n\nShe described the Human Rights report as \u201cshocking\u201d and said it \u201cneeds to be read by every Member of Congress who cares about the women and men who put on the uniform to defend this nation.\u201d\n\nGillibrand highlighted that the Defense Department estimates 62 percent of people who report sexual assault said they experienced retaliation, adding that the figure \u201chas not changed in years.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese sickening stories of retaliation against survivors should make every American angry.
