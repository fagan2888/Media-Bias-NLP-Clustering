If they wish to further pursue the merger they proposed 13 months ago, one of the two entities would have to divest its outpatient surgical center. Cottage operates the first freestanding outpatient surgical center in the state \u200b\u2014 \u200bwith 40 employees and four operating theaters. There, 2,500 operations were performed last year. Sansum just opened one of California\u2019s newest centers only three months ago and performed 30 operations there last month.\n\nIn reply, Cottage CEO Ron Werft and Sansum executive Kurt Ransohoff jointly announced Cottage would sell its surgical center and equipment \u200b\u2014 \u200bbut not the real estate. Werft said no price had been envisioned, but specialized brokerage firm Cain Brothers has been hired. Discussions between the FTC and the two health-care operations have occurred in the past 13 months, but very little written down, said Werft. \u201cWhat we are able to determine is this is a big concern, and we have to address it,\u201d he said. Asked if divesting the Cottage center will be sufficient for the FTC to green light the merger, Werft said, \u201cWe don\u2019t know. We aren\u2019t in a position to predict what the FTC will do.\u201d Likewise, Werft stressed no sale would take place if the merger were not approved.\n\nThe merger would combine the county\u2019s largest outpatient medical care provider, Sansum, \u200band its largest in-patient care provider, Cottage. In the post\u2013Affordable Care Act landscape, \u201cintegrated service\u201d has emerged as a potent new buzzword, and the proposed merger purports to provide just that. Some primary-care doctors have expressed concern they might be left out in the economic cold should the merger be approved. Some big employers have expressed concern that further monopolization of medical care might drive up the cost of employee health care. Werft stated that the divestiture will delay the merger process by at least six months. For the 40 employees now working for Cottage\u2019s surgical center, he acknowledged, \u201cThis will be an unsettling time.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://media.independent.com/img/croppedphotos/2012/01/06/01062012-Cottage-Hospital-Tour-1.jpg", "description": "The Feds Have Expressed Concerns About A Monopoly.", "title": "Sansum-Cottage Merger on Hold"}, "verify-v1": "ILofteeXjEGSBFwUf9oRyP4hdhxQ7F35jPp2MwAQrUE=", "y_key": "33d4a6dfbd23f58a", "description": "The Feds Have Expressed Concerns About A Monopoly.", "title": "Sansum-Cottage Merger on Hold"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9d70\"", "article_summary": "Asked if divesting the Cottage center will be sufficient for the FTC to green light the merger, Werft said, \u201cWe don\u2019t know.\nIf they wish to further pursue the merger they proposed 13 months ago, one of the two entities would have to divest its outpatient surgical center.\nCottage operates the first freestanding outpatient surgical center in the state \u200b\u2014 \u200bwith 40 employees and four operating theaters.\nFor the 40 employees now working for Cottage\u2019s surgical center, he acknowledged, \u201cThis will be an unsettling time.\u201d\nThe merger would combine the county\u2019s largest outpatient medical care provider, Sansum, \u200band its largest in-patient care provider, Cottage."}
