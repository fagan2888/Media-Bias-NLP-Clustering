All these years later, there are lots of conflicting studies about how many nutrients are actually lost during the soaking process, including from a camp of folks who think beans are more nutritious after soaking because they lose their phytic acid, which can reduce the body\u2019s ability to absorb nutrients.\n\nSome dried beans, including red kidney beans, release potentially toxic substances into the water when soaking, so it\u2019s definitely a good idea to drain them. And all beans lose some gas-producing sugars when soaked.\n\nThe studies I looked at found that the amount of nutrients lost during soaking is negligible, and the loss of gas-producing sugars is worth throwing out the water.\n\nThe truth is that eating beans more regularly will allow your digestive system to get used to all that extra fiber \u2014 especially the billions of bacteria that call your intestines home.\n\n\u2013 Addie Broyles, Cox Newspapers", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://health.heraldtribune.com/files/2014/11/hfnutribrief.jpg"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}}, "article_summary": "Really old dried beans will take a much longer time to soften, and even then, the texture will be off.\nQ: Why soak dried beans before you cook them?\nSome dried beans, including red kidney beans, release potentially toxic substances into the water when soaking, so it\u2019s definitely a good idea to drain them.\nA: First off, the freshness of your beans makes more of a difference in cooking time than how long you soak them will, or if you soak them at all \u2014 although soaking them does help them cook more evenly.\nAdelle Davis\u2019 1947 book, \u201cLet\u2019s Cook It Right,\u201d encourages us to cook beans in the same water that they\u2019ve been soaked in, so as to not throw away the nutrients that leach into the water."}
