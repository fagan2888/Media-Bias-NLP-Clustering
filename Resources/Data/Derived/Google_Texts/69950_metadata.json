( Trevor L Davis / Loveland Reporter-Herald )\n\nNext week is shaping up to be quite the exciting one for the Thompson Valley softball team.\n\nThe Eagles head down the final stretch of the regular season breathing down the neck of crosstown rival Mountain View in the race for the Northern Conference title.\n\nHaving handed the first-place Mountain Lions (14-3, 11-1) their only league loss of the season in mid September, the second-place Eagles still control their own destiny. The two rivals meet again in both teams' league finale Thursday at MVHS, which could serve as a pseudo league championship.\n\nBut in order for that to happen, the Eagles have to take care of business against two other league foes first, starting with Saturday's home finale against Boulder.\n\nThompson Valley pitcher Kailyn McVay threw a six-inning one-hit shutout in her team's win over Boulder on Saturday. (Trevor L Davis / Loveland Reporter-Herald)\n\nThe last-place Panthers provided some resistance early but couldn't hang around long enough to put any real scare into the Eagles, who rode a dominant pitching performance by Kailyn McVay for a 10-0 six-inning victory at Centennial Ball Park.\n\n\"This game was as important as next week's games, so we just remained focused and did our jobs and got it done,\" said McVay, who allowed just one hit, struck out nine and walked none to improve to 8-1 this season.\n\nSaturday was the final home game for the Eagles' lone senior, Allie Mason, a four-year starter for TVHS and a key cog in the middle of the order since she was a freshman.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMason scored three times Saturday, including \u2014 fittingly \u2014 the game-ending run in the sixth when she was driven home by Janessa Rivera, who was the catalyst offensively with three hits, two runs and two RBI.\n\n\"Allie's a kid who's really grown, who the rest of the kids in the program look up to as a leader,\" said TVHS coach Bryon Rutherford, whose team improved to 11-5 overall and 10-2 in league play. \"It's going to hurt not to have her next year, but we're going to ride her the rest of this year as long as we can.\"\n\nRutherford had a short practice Thursday and gave his team a day off Friday because of the Mountain View-Thompson Valley football game (a 40-23 Eagles' win). So their bats weren't exactly sharp to begin the game Saturday. Eventually, though, they got it going just enough to enact the 10-run rule.\n\nFreshman Makenna McVay led off the Eagles' first with a single and came around to score on one of the Panthers' eight errors on the day later in the inning to give her team a 1-0 lead.\n\nTVHS added four in the third, including RBI by Kami Reiger and Rivera, and four more in the fifth, with runs driven in by Elizabeth Texeira and Katie Seja. The Eagles nearly ended it in five, up 9-0, but had to wait another frame to finish it off as Mason came around from second on Rivera's third base hit of the contest.\n\n\"We've bonded so much this season, so leaving them is going to be a little hard, but we've still got a lot of games,\" Mason said. \"We're going to take it all the way.\"\n\nThompson Valley still can't focus on its potential massive rematch with Mountain View quite yet, as a road game at third-place Silver Creek (11-5-1, 9-3) on Tuesday still looms. The Raptors are, after all, one of just two teams in the league to beat the Eagles this year.\n\n\"We definitely can't overlook any team,\" Mason said. \"We're going to play our hearts out against Mountain View and Silver Creek because we really want to get this conference title for our school.\"\n\nSean Star: 970-669-5050, sstar@reporter-herald.com or twitter.com/seanvstar\n\nEagles 10, Panthers 0\n\nAt Centennial Ball Park\n\nBoulder 000 000 \u2014 0 1 8\n\nThompson Valley 104 041 \u2014 10 8 0\n\nW \u2014 Kailyn McVay.
