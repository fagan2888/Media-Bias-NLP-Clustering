There was a chance to do it and I felt good, my legs felt good,\u201d he said. \u201cI knew it would be one of my rare chances to win a stage.\u201d\n\nThe 170-kilometer (105.4-mile) stage from Gerardmer to Mulhouse \u2014 in the Vosges mountain range near the German border \u2014 featured six mostly moderate uphill treks that posed Martin little problem, even though he is not a reputed climber.\n\n\u201cWhen the stage started to climb I realized I was stronger and started to attack and then things went well,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re close to Germany and that was an extra incentive.\u201d\n\nIt was a good day for France with Gallopin set to defend the yellow jersey on Monday \u2014 Bastille Day \u2014 and for Germany, where most attention was on the national team\u2019s World Cup final against Argentina in Brazil later on Sunday.\n\nMartin plans to have his feet up in front of the television to follow the match.\n\nPHOTOS: Tour de France, Stage 9 \u2013 Sunday, July 13, 2014\n\n\u201cOf course I will watch it,\u201d said Martin, who had a winning time of 4 hours, 10 minutes. \u201cLet\u2019s say Germany will win \u2014 that\u2019s for sure. I\u2019m a good omen. Let\u2019s say 3-0.\u201d\n\nGallopin, of the Lotto Belisol team, finished several minutes behind but did well enough to erase his deficit of more than three minutes to Nibali.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s with great pride that I will ride on the national holiday day in the yellow jersey,\u201d the 26-year-old Gallopin said. \u201cIt\u2019s a little bit scary, but I will enjoy the day.\u201d\n\nGallopin leads Nibali by 1 minute, 34 seconds.\n\nThe last Frenchman to wear the yellow jersey was Thomas Voeckler in 2011. He also wore it in 2004 \u2014 the year disgraced cyclist Lance Armstrong won the sixth of his seven Tour crowns, before later being stripped of all of his titles for doping.\n\nShortly before the day\u2019s most difficult climb \u2014 a Category 1 ascent up Le Markstein \u2014 Martin broke away about 60 kilometers (37 miles) from the end. Gallopin\u2019s chasing group was about two minutes behind them and Nibali more than six minutes adrift.\n\nMartin was no threat to Nibali\u2019s yellow jersey, but the 26-year-old Gallopin was.\n\nNibali was losing more and more ground, and urged his Astana teammates to step up the pace as they reached the last of climbs \u2014 a short, but sharp climb up Grand Ballon. But they had left themselves far too much to do.\n\nMartin, who narrowly beat Tour champion Chris Froome in last year\u2019s time trial, continued to surge ahead, with a favorable wind behind him making for a quick descent down to the finish for his third career stage win.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Tony Martin wins 9th stage of Tour de France; Gallopin takes lead", "title": "Tony Martin wins 9th stage of Tour de France; Gallopin takes lead", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/07/13/tony-martin-wins-9th-stage-of-tour-de-france-gallopin-takes-lead/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140713_113612_tony-martin.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140713_113612_tony-martin.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-07-13T11:39:40+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T05:07:04+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc998c\"", "article_summary": "\u201cIt\u2019s with great pride that I will ride on the national holiday day in the yellow jersey,\u201d the 26-year-old Gallopin said.\nThe last Frenchman to wear the yellow jersey was Thomas Voeckler in 2011.\nPHOTOS: Tour de France, Stage 9 \u2013 Sunday, July 13, 2014\u201cOf course I will watch it,\u201d said Martin, who had a winning time of 4 hours, 10 minutes.\nMartin was no threat to Nibali\u2019s yellow jersey, but the 26-year-old Gallopin was.\nMULHOUSE, France \u2014 German rider Tony Martin broke ahead early and comfortably held on to win the hilly ninth stage of the Tour de France on Sunday, while Frenchman Tony Gallopin took the yellow jersey from overnight leader Vincenzo Nibali of Italy."}
