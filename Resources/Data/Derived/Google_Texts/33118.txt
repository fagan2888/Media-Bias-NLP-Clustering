Birthdays can be tough when you lose a parent. Amanda Sanchez lost her dad in 2007 while he was on active duty.

The organization's mission is to serve the children of fallen active duty military personnel who have given their lives while defending the United States of America.

Through the organization, Amanda was able to have a memorable birthday. Amanda received two big boxes filled with 13 gifts for her 13th birthday.
