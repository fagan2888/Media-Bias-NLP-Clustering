These fat cats do not represent the best interests of American entrepreneurs, American workers, American parents and students, or Americans of any race, class, or age who believe in low taxes and limited government. The chamber\u2019s business is the big business of the Beltway, not the business of mainstream America.\n\nIf you are a business owner who believes your country should strictly and consistently enforce its borders and deport illegal immigrants who violate the terms of their visas, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce doesn\u2019t represent you.\n\nIf you are a worker who believes that the feds should punish illegal aliens who use fake documents to obtain jobs instead of rewarding them with \u201clegal status,\u201d the U.S. Chamber of Commerce doesn\u2019t champion you.\n\nIf you are a parent or educator who opposes top-down federal education schemes such as Common Core that undermine local control, dumb down rigorous curricula, and threaten family privacy while enriching big business and lobbying groups, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce doesn\u2019t speak for you.\n\nIf you are a taxpayer who has had enough of crony capitalism and publicly funded bailouts of failing corporations, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce doesn\u2019t work for you.\n\nLast year, the Chamber poured more than $52 million into K Street lobbying efforts on behalf of illegal-alien amnesty, Fed Ed Common Core programs, and increased federal spending. This year, chamber bigwigs are paving the perilous pathway to GOP capitulation. The Left hardly needs to lift a finger against tea-party candidates and activists who are bravely challenging the big-government status quo. The Chamber has already volunteered to spend $50 million subsidizing the Republican incumbency-protection racket and attacking anti-establishment conservatives.\n\nAllow me to say, \u201cI told you so.\u201d In 2010, when President Barack Obama hypocritically attacked the Chamber for accepting \u201cforeign donations\u201d right before the midterm elections, many on the right rushed to the group\u2019s side. But as I warned then, the purported enemy of my enemy is . . . sometimes my worst enemy. Barely three months after their Kabuki campaign fight, Obama and the Chamber had already kissed and made up.\n\nThe Chamber joined hands with the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations on a joint campaign to support Obama\u2019s increased government infrastructure and spending proposals, stuffed with Big Labor payoffs.\n\nThe Chamber is one of the staunchest promoters of mass illegal immigration, and it joined with the AFL-CIO and American Civil Liberties Union to oppose immigration-enforcement measures.\n\nThe Chamber opposed E-verify and sued Arizona over its employer-sanctions law.\n\nThe Chamber supported a pro-Obamacare, pro-TARP, pro-stimulus, pro-amnesty Democrat in Arizona over his free-market GOP challenger.\n\nThe Chamber supported the George W. Bush/Obama TARP, the Bush/Obama auto bailout, and the billion-dollar, pork-stuffed stimulus.\n\nThis isn\u2019t about letting the best ideas and businesses thrive. It\u2019s about picking winners and losers. It\u2019s about \u201cmanaging\u201d competition and engineering political outcomes under the guise of stimulating the economy and supporting \u201ccommerce.\u201d What\u2019s in it for the statist businesses that go along for the ride with Obama and his team of corruptocrats? Like they say in the Windy City: It\u2019s all about the boodle \u2014 publicly subsidized payoffs meted out to the corruptocrats\u2019 friends and special interests.\n\nIn the case of Common Core, the Chamber has made common cause with the left-wing, corporate-bashing Center for American Progress in a new Bootleggers and Baptists coalition. They are strange bedfellows who both profit from increased federal government intervention. For giant corporate publishers, such as Pearson and other big-business ventures backed by the Chamber, it\u2019s all about cashing in on the public schools\u2019 Common Core captive guinea pigs in testing, teaching, data collection, and data analysis.\n\nFor big-government advocacy groups, such as CAP, it\u2019s all about diminishing state, local, and parental control over local education and curricular decisions, expanding Washington\u2019s regulatory reach into the classroom, and ensuring the perpetuation of the Fed Ed bureaucracy.\n\nWhen businesses get in the government handout line, it\u2019s not a \u201cpublic-private partnership.\u201d It\u2019s corporate welfare. It\u2019s venture socialism. Whatever you call it, it stinks as much under Democrat administrations as it does under Republican ones.\n\nAlways beware of Washington business-boosters wearing false free-market facades.\n\n\u2014 Michelle Malkin is the author of Culture of Corruption: Obama and His Team of Tax Cheats, Crooks & Cronies (Regnery 2010).
