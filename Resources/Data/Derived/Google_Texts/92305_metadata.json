We cannot afford to provide every service in every location.\"\n\nKentuckyOne Health employs more than 15,000 people at 200 sites across the Commonwealth. Its partners include St. Joseph Regional Medical Centers in Berea, Mt. Sterling and Martin County, a medical center in Shelbyville tied to Jewish Hospital, numerous group medical practices, the Frazier Rehab & Neuroscience Center, the James Graham Brown Cancer Center and Our Lady of Peace adult psychiatric facility in Louisville.\n\n\"Some of this may be eliminating duplication of service,\" Schansberg said. \"You're gonna have maybe whole departments that are gonna get hacked, or whatever.\"\n\nBrinkley has declined comment since announcing the staff reductions via KentuckyOne Health's web site Monday.\n\n\"Preventive care has a greater emphasis,\" said Schansberg. \"So those jobs would be relatively safe.\"\n\nBut competition could make administrative and direct-care jobs vulnerable.\n\nVia online message, Brlnkley advises that laid off employees will receive severance based upon seniority. KentuckyOne Health also will offer out-placement services and counseling, including extended employee assistance programs.\n\n\"We presently are notifying affected employees,\" said Barbara Mackovic, a KentuckyOne Health spokeswoman. \"It would be inappropriate to discuss details until that is complete.\"\n\nMackovic said KentuckyOne Health expects to complete notifications by February 28. She would not confirm whether KentuckyOne Health would terminate all employees affected by that date. Schansberg said versatility could be offer some protection.\n\n\"If you're a highly skilled worker and they really value you, they can probably find some other place for you,\" Dr. Schansburg said. \"But there's limits to that too.\"\n\nCopyright 2014 WAVE 3 News.
