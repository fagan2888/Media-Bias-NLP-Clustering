But at least Sen. Mike Lee.\n\nThree of the Utah Republican\u2019s closest allies in the Senate \u2014 Ted Cruz of Texas, Rand Paul of Kentucky, and Marco Rubio of Florida, are running for the Republican presidential nomination.\n\nLee said he hopes \u201cto be of service\u201d to each of them, but he\u2019s not planning to endorse any of them any time soon, he said Friday at a breakfast with reporters hosted by the Christian Science Monitor.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not inclined to endorse any one of them at this point because I can\u2019t endorse one of them without un-endorsing one of the others. At this point, I don\u2019t see any reason to do that,\u201d Lee said.\n\nLee\u2019s endorsement could prove valuable in the primaries, as candidates look to shore up their conservative credentials. In the previous Congress, Lee had the highest score of any lawmaker from Heritage Action, a conservative advocacy group.\n\nLee is Cruz\u2019s closest ally in the Senate, and he was elected to the upper chamber in the same cycle as Paul and Rubio.\n\nAfter Cruz made his announcement on March 23, Lee released a statement that said \u201cthe most important thing for conservatives to focus on in the presidential race is not the candidate we run, but the agenda we run on.\u201d\n\nLee said he hoped his party would nominate someone who is \u201cprincipled, and positive, and proven.\u201d\n\n\u201cSomeone who\u2019s not afraid to admit why he or she is a conservative. Not afraid to demonstrate that commitment to conservative principles,\u201d he said.\n\nAt the Iowa Freedom Summit in January, the first major event for would-be 2016 conservative contenders, Lee described his ideal candidate as \u201cnot necessarily the guy who just shouts the word freedom the loudest. He\u2019s not necessarily the guy who dials up his criticism of the president to 11 or 12.\u201d\n\nIn assessing the strengths and weaknesses of Cruz, Paul, and Rubio, Lee praised the Texas senator\u2019s \u201cpassion\u201d and \u201capproach to constitutional issues.\u201d\n\n\u201cIdeologically I share a lot in common with Ted Cruz. I like his passion. I like his dedication to conservative principles and his willingness to fight even when it\u2019s hard,\u201d Lee said.\n\nBut Lee also noted that \u201csome of those same characteristics have been characterized by some as a weakness, as an Achilles\u2019 heel for him.\u201d\n\nLee supported Cruz in instigating the government shutdown over Obamacare in October 2013. On the campaign trail, Cruz has said that he and Lee were \u201cpunished\u201d for the episode, as party leadership pressured PACs to cut off their funding.\n\nOn Friday, Lee downplayed those claims.\n\n\u201c[Cruz] may have felt more of a difference at the time than I did, you\u2019d have to ask him. I\u2019m not aware of any conspiracy to shut us out of anything. I\u2019m not aware of any one person or one group of people who has the ability do that,\u201d Lee said.\n\nLee also heaped praise on Paul and Rubio \u2014 the former for his 13-hour filibuster over the Obama administration\u2019s drone strike policy, and the latter for his ability as a speaker.\n\nAlthough Cruz, a collegiate debate champion, is well-known for his speaking ability, Lee said that Rubio could be the best orator in the Republican field.\n\n\u201cAt least among the current field of presidential candidates, I don\u2019t know if we have any other candidate who is as good as Rubio is at communicating, delivering a speech, and inviting the audience into kind of an emotional journey as he speaks,\u201d Lee said.\n\nRubio has not officially launched his campaign yet, but he is expected to announce his candidacy on April 13 in Miami.\n\nLee said that Rubio could be hurt by his involvement in the bipartisan Gang of Eight, which devised a set of comprehensive immigration reforms in 2013. His role in crafting the legislation could \u201cconcern\u201d the conservative primary voter base , according to Lee.\n\nAnd Paul\u2019s views on foreign policy, which some view as radically isolationist, could be a liability according to Lee. Not to mention that Paul\u2019s positions are often linked to his father\u2019s, former Texas Rep. Ron Paul, who sought the GOP nomination in 2008 and 2012.\n\nLee said that the elder Paul\u2019s \u201cidiosyncratic\u201d views could could be a \u201cchallenge\u201d for his son to overcome.", "article_metadata": {"liveFyreID": "aHR0cDovL3RyYWlsYmxhemVyc2Jsb2cuZGFsbGFzbmV3cy5jb20vMjAxNS8wNC9jcnV6LWFsbHktbWlrZS1sZWUtcHJhaXNlcy1nb3AtY2FuZGlkYXRlcy1idXQtZG9lc250LWVuZG9yc2Utb25lLmh0bWwv", "generator": "WordPress 3.9.12", "author": "Michael Marks", "og": {"site_name": "Trail Blazers Blog", "description": "WASHINGTON -- It\u2019s a position everyone can relate to: four friends start a job, they each make a name for themselves, and before you know it three of them are\u2026", "title": "Cruz ally Mike Lee praises GOP candidates, but doesn\u2019t endorse one", "url": "http://trailblazersblog.dallasnews.com/2015/04/cruz-ally-mike-lee-praises-gop-candidates-but-doesnt-endorse-one.html/", "image": "http://trailblazersblog.dallasnews.com/wp-content/themes/dallasnews/images/facebook-default-black.jpg", "type": "article"}, "LastModifiedDate": "2015-04-10T10:50:32Z", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image"}, "PublishDate": "1970-01-01T00:00:00Z", "wp-parsely_version": "1.7", "viewport": "width=device-width", "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"publishtime": "1970-01-01T00:00:00Z"}}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe22e2\"", "article_summary": "Lee is Cruz\u2019s closest ally in the Senate, and he was elected to the upper chamber in the same cycle as Paul and Rubio.\n\u201cI\u2019m not inclined to endorse any one of them at this point because I can\u2019t endorse one of them without un-endorsing one of the others.\nAnd Paul\u2019s views on foreign policy, which some view as radically isolationist, could be a liability according to Lee.\nIn the previous Congress, Lee had the highest score of any lawmaker from Heritage Action, a conservative advocacy group.\nLee said that the elder Paul\u2019s \u201cidiosyncratic\u201d views could could be a \u201cchallenge\u201d for his son to overcome."}
