A 23-year-old American was killed in Friday night's devastating six-part attack in Paris, according to California State University, Long Beach.

Nohemi Gonzalez, a CSU Long Beach student, was in Paris attending Strate College of Design for a semester abroad program, the school said.

Gonzalez was one of 17 CSU Long Beach students studying abroad at Strate, according to a school official. The 16 other students are safe, according to the school.

Gonzalez, from El Monte, California, was a junior studying design.

"I'm deeply saddened by the news of the passing of Long Beach State University student Nohemi Gonzalez. Our thoughts and prayers are with her family and friends during this sad time," said university President Jane Close Conoley.

The university will hold a vigil Sunday.

The U.S. Embassy in Paris also confirmed her death.

A State Department spokesperson said, "We can confirm that one American citizen has been killed in the attacks. Out of respect for the privacy of the family, we have nothing further at this time. We continue to reach out to other Americans affected by these attacks, including several Americans who were injured."
