Lebanese media said Satem was a 19-year-old from Wadi Khaled, in north Lebanon close to the Syrian border.\n\n(Reporting by Dominic Evans; Editing by Kevin Liffey)", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Reuters Editorial", "Author": "Reuters Editorial", "DCSext.PageNumber": 1, "twitter": {"description": "A statement in the name of the al Qaeda-linked militant group Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant claimed responsibility on Saturday for a suicide bombing in the Hezbollah stronghold of southern Beirut that killed at least five people two days ago.", "title": "Islamic State group claims Beirut bombing: statement", "image": "http://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20140104&t=2&i=826680701&w=&fh=545px&fw=&ll=&pl=&sq=&r=CBREA0316HM00", "creator": "@Reuters", "site": "@Reuters", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "DCSext.rChannel": "Article -
