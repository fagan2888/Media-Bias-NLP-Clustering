At tax time the following year, people need the MNsure forms to reconcile the subsidies they received with what they should have collected based on their actual income.\n\nIn addition, people who qualify for tax credits can defer the benefit until tax time \u2014 a circumstance where taxpayers this winter might be eager to get paperwork and file returns as quickly as possible.\n\nDelaney said another batch of forms is scheduled to go out this week. He did not offer a specific timeline for when the job would be done.\n\n\u201cWe are keenly aware of the tax filing deadline,\u201d Delaney said. \u201cWe will definitely have them out before then.\u201d\n\nMNsure officials said the new automated process for generating forms will benefit taxpayers in the long run, but some have been expressing frustration on social media about this year\u2019s experience.\n\nAs of March 6 last year, MNsure had sent more than 33,000 forms, and had another 1,300 documents to deliver. As of Tuesday, 25,156 forms had been mailed, Delaney said, with another 21,675 forms yet to be sent.\n\nLike last year, MNsure has delayed sending many forms to ensure accuracy. Forms are more complicated when people have coverage for only part of the year, Delaney said, or when changes in income or household composition change eligibility for tax credits.\n\nIn the end, the error rate on forms during the 2015 tax season was less than 3 percent. That was better than for the federal HealthCare.gov exchange, which in February 2015 said that about 20 percent of filers who got tax credits through the website \u2014 roughly 800,000 people \u2014 would be receiving corrected forms.\n\nTwitter: @chrissnowbeck", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Star Tribune", "description": "Officials with the state health exchange had hoped to mail all of the documents in February.", "title": "Thousands of MNsure users still waiting for tax forms", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/thousands-of-mnsure-users-still-waiting-for-tax-forms/370719641/", "image": {"url": "http://assets.startribune.com/static/img/branding/logos/strib-social-card.png?d=1464201091", "width": 1680, "identifier": "http://assets.startribune.com/static/img/branding/logos/strib-social-card.png?d=1464201091", "height": 876}, "type": "article"}, "google-site-verification": "bLXTXkzm4dJ8hcJy1LXawtxXxGP3JhInARj69uCiMiM", "twitter": {"description": "Officials with the state health exchange had hoped to mail all of the documents in February.", "title": "Thousands of MNsure users still waiting for tax forms", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/thousands-of-mnsure-users-still-waiting-for-tax-forms/370719641/", "image": {"src": "http://assets.startribune.com/static/img/branding/logos/strib-social-card.png?d=1464201091", "identifier": "http://assets.startribune.com/static/img/branding/logos/strib-social-card.png?d=1464201091"}, "site": "@StarTribune", "card": "summary"}, "description": "Officials with the state health exchange had hoped to mail all of the documents in February."}, "article_summary": "MNsure still hasn\u2019t sent more than 21,000 tax forms to people who bought coverage through the state\u2019s health insurance exchange last year.\nBased on income projections, MNsure shoppers access tax credits to discount premiums as they pay for coverage during the year.\nAt tax time the following year, people need the MNsure forms to reconcile the subsidies they received with what they should have collected based on their actual income.\nAs of March 6 last year, MNsure had sent more than 33,000 forms, and had another 1,300 documents to deliver.\nMinnesota launched the MNsure exchange in late 2013 to implement the federal Affordable Care Act, which makes tax credits available to individuals and families that buy private health insurance policies through a government-run exchange."}
