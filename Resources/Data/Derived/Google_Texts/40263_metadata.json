CPPIB agreed to pay $12 billion in a transaction that grants it access to U.S. middle-market loans.\n\n\u0093Senior debt is an attractive asset class for CPPIB\u0092s investors,\u0094 says GE Antares CEO David Brackett.\n\nCPPIB is an active private equity investor, and also invests in debt \u0096 including leveraged loans, high yield bonds and mezzanine loans, plus intellectual property and other financing options.\n\nThe pension fund beat out big-name bidders, including Apollo Global Management (NYSE: APO), Ares Management (NYSE: ARES), the Blackstone Group (NYSE: BX), Kolhberg Kravis Roberts & Co. (NYSE: KKR), Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc. (NYSE: MTU), SunTrust Banks Inc. (NYSE: STI) and Guggenheim Securities that reportedly came out for the auction.\n\nThe acquisition of Sponsor Finance also gives the firm something it didn\u0092t have before \u0096 relationships with more than 300 private equity firms. GE Capital\u0092s Sponsor Finance unit is a large part of the reason the firm won Mergers & Acquisitions M&A Mid-Market Lender of the Year award for 2014.\n\nThough CPPIB gains middle-market loan access through the acquisition, the Sponsor Finance unit is losing its GE access. \u0093GE was a tremendous partner for us together we built what we think is the preeminent player in the senior debt space,\u0094 says Brackett. Under the new ownership, the unit, which will now be known as Antares Capital, will have more autonomy, and plans to expand beyond senior debt into mezzanine and junior debt, according to Brackett. For its part, CPPIB is bringing a AAA rating and permanent capital base to the deal.\n\nBrackett and John Martin, also CEO, will lead Antares Capital, which will remain headquartered in Chicago. A significant amount of Antares\u0092 management team reinvested in the deal, alongside CPPIB. The monetary amount reinvested was not disclosed, and in the grand scheme of things opposite CPPIB\u0092s investment, the management team\u0092s contribution may not look that large, but \u0093personally, it feels very meaningful,\u0094 says Antares CEO Martin.\n\nAntares, perhaps the most prized subset of GE Capital Sponsor Finance, was birthed by executives who met at Heller Financial, the Chicago-based finance firm that rose to prominence in the \u009180s and \u009190s by focusing only on the middle market. The firm developed a culture of nurturing talent, and in 1996, a dozen Heller executives, including Brackett, left to form Antares Capital, which was backed by Mass Mutual Life Insurance Co. After acquiring Heller in 2001 for $5.3 billion, GE added Antares in 2005.\n\nThe fate of the company\u0092s senior secured loan program, a joint venture between GE Capital Sponsor Finance and Ares, is not yet determined. \u0093Given the nature of the process, we really did not have the ability to engage with Ares about what our partnership would look like going forward,\u0094 says Martin. \u0093We were just able to start those conversations late yesterday, and those conversations are continuing.\u0094\n\nThe sale of GE Capital Sponsor Finance is part of GE CEO Jeffrey Immelt\u0092s larger plan to divest nearly all of GE Capital, which he announced April 10. Shedding the unit will allow GE to strip its Systemically Important Financial Institution status and focus on its industrial operations.\n\nEven with the Sponsor Finance unit\u0092s sale penned, GE has several more GE Capital divisions to unload. The only units the company is keeping are GE Capital Aviation Services, Energy Financial Services and Healthcare Equipment Finance, which are related to its industrial side.\n\nMitsubishi UFJ and Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Inc. are expected to bid for GE Capital Asia. And in early June, GE reportedly hired investment banks to sell its health care, railcar and franchise finance units.\n\nBy 2018, and with the sale of GE Capital, GE expects industrial earnings to make up more than 90 percent of the company\u0092s total earnings.\n\nFor more information on related topics, visit the following:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.themiddlemarket.com/news/lender_news/for-antares-capital-new-ownership-means-expansion-beyond-senior-debt-256722-1.html", "image": "http://cdn.themiddlemarket.com/media/newspics/david-brackett.jpg", "site_name": "Mergers & Acquisitions, Latest News", "title": "For GE Capital\u2019s Coveted Antares Unit, New Owner Means Expansion Beyond Senior Debt"}}, "article_summary": "\u0093Senior debt is an attractive asset class for CPPIB\u0092s investors,\u0094 says GE Antares CEO David Brackett.\nBy 2018, and with the sale of GE Capital, GE expects industrial earnings to make up more than 90 percent of the company\u0092s total earnings.\nThough CPPIB gains middle-market loan access through the acquisition, the Sponsor Finance unit is losing its GE access.\nEven with the Sponsor Finance unit\u0092s sale penned, GE has several more GE Capital divisions to unload.\nThe fate of the company\u0092s senior secured loan program, a joint venture between GE Capital Sponsor Finance and Ares, is not yet determined."}
