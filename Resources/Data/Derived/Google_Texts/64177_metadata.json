I\u2019m hoping this is the year,\u201d said Rand, who hosted an Affordable Care Act event Tuesday at the diner. \u201cI believe it\u2019s important. I would love it if everyone could have insurance.\u201d\n\nAdditional Images Mike Sajecki, 27, a cook at Becky\u2019s Diner in Portland, has health insurance this year because he obtained coverage during the first round of sign-ups. His insurance costs $230 per month and includes dental and vision. \u201cI can afford that,\u201d he said.

People can sign up on the marketplace through Feb. 15.\n\nThe marketplace is where those without insurance \u2013 including those who work but can\u2019t obtain coverage from an employer \u2013 can purchase subsidized individual insurance.\n\n\u201cThe kids never think they\u2019re going to get sick,\u201d Rand said. \u201cBut you never know what\u2019s going to happen to you.\u201d\n\nThe marketplace enrolled 44,000 Mainers for coverage this year \u2013 7.1 million nationwide \u2013 and health care advocates hope thousands more uninsured Mainers will obtain benefits for 2015. Emily Brostek, executive director of Consumers for Affordable Health Care, an Augusta nonprofit that advocates for reforms and helps people purchase insurance on healthcare.gov, said the statewide network of groups that helps people sign up has been \u201cslammed\u201d with calls this week from potential enrollees.\n\nNationally, news reports said 100,000 people applied for coverage on Saturday, a sharp contrast to the glitch-filled rollout last year when the website did not work smoothly for months. State-by-state numbers are not yet available, and are typically released monthly.\n\nMike Sajecki, a cook at Becky\u2019s Diner, said he didn\u2019t need any convincing from Rand, and had purchased an ACA plan for 2014. Sajecki, 27, said he mostly had been without insurance in recent years, forcing him to pay out-of-pocket for several ailments, including a collapsed lung that cost him $12,000.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m still paying that one off,\u201d he said.\n\nSajecki said a few years before the ACA marketplace began offering insurance for 2014, he purchased an individual policy. But with a $500 monthly premium, it was too expensive and he had to drop coverage. The ACA plan he\u2019s now using costs $230 per month and includes dental and vision.\n\n\u201cI can afford that,\u201d the Portland resident said.\n\nRand\u2019s business is too large to be eligible for tax credits that reduce health care costs for small businesses with 25 or fewer employees. However, Mitchell Stein, an independent health policy analyst, said the federal government also has set up a marketplace for small businesses \u2013 called SHOP \u2013 that in theory should make offering health coverage more affordable for businesses than in the past.\n\n\u201cThe marketplace is having insurance companies compete with each other to keep the rates low, just like for individuals,\u201d Stein said. \u201cBut each company is going to have to make its own decision. Everyone realizes it\u2019s not going to be the right decision for every small-business owner.\u201d\n\nThe ACA mandates that businesses offer employees health benefits or pay a penalty, but exempts businesses with 50 or fewer full-time employees.\n\nAccording to one Maine legislative report, as many as 80 percent of Maine businesses have fewer than 10 employees.\n\nDave Cousens, president of the Maine Lobstermen\u2019s Association, said at Tuesday\u2019s event that his health care costs were cut in half, and he persuaded his three sons, all lobstermen, to obtain ACA coverage.\n\n\u201cIf you own a business, and you don\u2019t have health insurance, your whole livelihood is at risk,\u201d Cousens said. \u201cFishermen don\u2019t like change, but they\u2019re hearing success stories. I just tell them to check it out.\u201d\n\nThe Maine Lobstermen\u2019s Association is promoting ACA coverage to lobstermen through an $80,000 federal grant. The group has met with thousands of lobstermen and helped hundreds sign up, although the group does not know how many completed the process and obtained coverage.\n\nHager, the federal DHHS official, said grass-roots efforts \u2013 including personal appeals like Rand\u2019s to her workers \u2013 are what make the ACA effective.\n\n\u201cThe ACA is working in Maine, working in Portland and throughout the country,\u201d Hager said. \u201cThis is a three-month enrollment period, and all hands are on deck.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "As the new round of Obamacare insurance sign-ups begins, small businesses look into coverage for workers and a help network in Maine gets slammed with calls.", "generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "description": "As the new round of Obamacare insurance sign-ups begins, small businesses look into coverage for workers and a help network in Maine gets slammed with calls.", "title": "Owner of Becky's Diner hopes to serve up health insurance for employees - The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 1000, "identifier": "http://www.pressherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/540506_579236-ACA0001.jpg", "height": 635}, "updated_time": "2014-11-19T00:12:37-04:00", "url": "http://www.pressherald.com/2014/11/19/health-care-on-beckys-diner-menu/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "As the new round of Obamacare insurance sign-ups begins, small businesses look into coverage for workers and a help network in Maine gets slammed with calls.", "creator": "@pressherald", "image": "http://www.pressherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/540506_579236-ACA0001.jpg", "title": "Owner of Becky's Diner hopes to serve up health insurance for employees - The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "site": "@pressherald", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=951845858", "fb": {"admins": 769488179, "app_id": 178078215650057}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/pressherald", "section": "Health care", "published_time": "2014-11-19T04:00:00-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-11-19T00:12:37-04:00"}, "google-site-verification": "QWs9pxQP8fwo2-nR5mWopc6qCK2D3920f7bl-U-zkso", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd3e0\"", "article_summary": "Gregory Rec/Staff Photographer Owner Becky Rand hopes to find affordable health insurance that she can offer to all of her employees at Becky\u2019s Diner in Portland.\n\u201cIf you own a business, and you don\u2019t have health insurance, your whole livelihood is at risk,\u201d Cousens said.\nBecky Rand would like to offer health care coverage for employees at her restaurant \u2013 Becky\u2019s Diner on the Portland waterfront \u2013 so she\u2019s crunching the numbers to see if it\u2019s financially possible.\nRand\u2019s business is too large to be eligible for tax credits that reduce health care costs for small businesses with 25 or fewer employees.\nSajecki said a few years before the ACA marketplace began offering insurance for 2014, he purchased an individual policy."}
