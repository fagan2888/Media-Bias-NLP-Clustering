All-cash real estate sales made up 38.9 percent of housing transactions in January 2015. While that’s a slight decline from the same month in 2014, it’s still well above historical averages, according to a new report by CoreLogic.

January marked the 25th consecutive monthly decline in the proportion of home sales made with all cash. Cash sales reached their peak in January 2011, when they comprised 46.5 percent of sales, but they averaged 25 percent prior to the housing bust. CoreLogic predicts the level of all-cash housing sales should fall back down to 25 percent by 2018.
