It may be the last milestone for many veterans who bore witness to the event, report Stacy Meichtry and Marion Halftermeyer, who write:\n\nFor decades, D-Day commemorations have served as a potent reminder of the shared sacrifice of American, Canadian, British and other Western forces to free Europe from the clutches of totalitarianism. Not only was the battle pivotal in defeating Adolf Hitler, it turned the page on centuries of European bloodshed, leading the way to a new order. With every year that passes, fewer and fewer veterans can muster strength to report to the commemorations. When Gen. Raaen traveled to Normandy a decade ago, he was accompanied by about 25 veterans and four historians. On his current visit, he says, it is the other way around: only a few veterans were able to come, along with a couple dozen historians\n\nReuters\n\nRose petals dropped by helicopters fall around the Statue of Liberty in New York Friday.\n\nEuropean Pressphoto Agency\n\nA honor guard walk along the the base of the Statue of Liberty during an event marking the 70th anniversary of D-Day.\n\nEuropean Pressphoto Agency\n\nA band and a Honor Guard gather at the base of the Statue of Liberty during the event.\n\nEuropean Pressphoto Agency\n\nFrench war veterans Jean Stefkovic, left, and Pierre Martinez talk during the event.\n\nKeith Bedford forThe Wall Street Journal\n\nFrench sailors from the frigate La Fayette are pictured during the event.\n\nKeith Bedford forThe Wall Street Journal\n\nA fire boat sprayed red, white, and blue water during the event.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "The 70th anniversary of D-Day was marked at the Statue of Liberty with an event that included the release of roses from helicopters flying overhead.", "title": "Photos: D-Day Anniversary Marked at Statue of Liberty", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2014/06/06/photos-d-day-anniversary-marked-at-statue-of-liberty/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-DD121_NYDDAY_P_20140606140629.jpg"}, "site": "WSJNY", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "New York", "article.headline": "Photos: D-Day Anniversary Marked at Statue of Liberty", "description": "The 70th anniversary of D-Day was marked at the Statue of Liberty with an event that included the release of roses from helicopters flying overhead.", "article_section": "New York", "author": "WSJ Staff", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "testkeys": "C", "article.page": "Metropolis Blog", "page.subsection": "Metropolis", "article.summary": "The 70th anniversary of D-Day was marked at the Statue of Liberty with an event that included the release of roses from helicopters flying overhead.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "page.content.format": "responsive", "article.published": "2014-06-06T18:26:53-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-158", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2014/06/06/photos-d-day-anniversary-marked-at-statue-of-liberty/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-METROB-20767", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "New York", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "The 70th anniversary of D-Day was marked at the Statue of Liberty with an event that included the release of roses from helicopters flying overhead.", "title": "Photos: D-Day Anniversary Marked at Statue of Liberty", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2014/06/06/photos-d-day-anniversary-marked-at-statue-of-liberty/", "image": {"width": 749, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-DD121_NYDDAY_P_20140606140629.jpg", "height": 499}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Metropolis", "article.id": "BL-METROB-20767", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2014-06-06T21:03:21-04:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0ec4\"", "article_summary": "European Pressphoto AgencyA honor guard walk along the the base of the Statue of Liberty during an event marking the 70th anniversary of D-Day.\nEuropean Pressphoto AgencyA band and a Honor Guard gather at the base of the Statue of Liberty during the event.\nRose petals are dropped from helicopters Friday during a ceremony remembering D-Day on Liberty Island in New York Keith Bedford for The Wall Street JournalThe 70th anniversary of D-Day was marked at the Statue of Liberty with an event that included the release of rose petals from helicopters flying overhead.\nKeith Bedford forThe Wall Street JournalFrench sailors from the frigate La Fayette are pictured during the event.\nKeith Bedford forThe Wall Street JournalA fire boat sprayed red, white, and blue water during the event."}
