NEW YORK (MainStreet) â€” While some consumers wait anxiously for the annual health care open enrollment period, other Americans are in a rush to choose benefits despite its lasting consequences.

Many employees simply skim over the material and fail to conduct any research on their health care benefits. It turns out that 41% of employees spent 15 minutes or less researching their benefit options during the 2013 open enrollment season and 24% spent five minutes or less, according to a survey by Aflac, the Columbus, Ga. voluntary insurance company.

In comparison, Americans spend an average of 10 hours researching the purchase of a new car, four hours shopping for computers and at least two deciding what television to buy.

The opportunity for employees to change and choose the insurance plan they will use for the next year starts Nov. 15 and ends Feb. 15.

Employees need to spend more time to review their health care options carefully and should consider it as part of their entire financial plan, says Michael Zuna, Aflac's chief marketing officer.

"We need to spend more time, especially in the changing health care environment," he said. "Now more than ever, [health care buyers] need to take the time to understand the details."

Instead of viewing open enrollment as a chore, employees should see this as a "big opportunity to save more money in their health plan," Zuna says. By picking the appropriate plan, consumers can minimize risk and save money by avoiding duplicating their coverage, since 42% of people waste $750 on mistakes on their health plan. Some consumers will add vision coverage when it is already covered by their major medical plan.
