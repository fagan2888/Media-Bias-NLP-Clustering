Surprise: New York Senator Kirsten Gillibrand isn’t the only woman in Congress to say she’s been at the receiving end of “different” treatment by her male colleagues since taking her place in the upper house boys’ club. In an interview with CNN’s Gloria Borger, Senator Elizabeth Warren said that she, too, has been treated differently as a woman in the Senate — but when asked to elaborate, she simply said, “Nope.”

“I’ve said all I’m going to say,” Warren said. “I wish it were [surprising]. But it’s hard to change these big, male-dominated institutions. What I am very happy about is that there are now enough women in the United States Senate to begin to change that place, and I believe that’s just powerfully important.
