Ted Cruz\u2019s tax proposal would cost $8.6 trillion over the course of a decade.\n\nIn addition to adding nearly $9 trillion to the deficit, the nonpartisan think tank estimates an additional $12.2 trillion would be tacked on the following decade.\n\nCruz proposed simplifying the tax code by eliminating the seven current tax brackets, replacing them with a 10 percent flat income tax rate. Businesses would also see a lower rate in the form of 16 percent value-added tax. Companies would be allowed to deduct for employer contributions to retirement plans, and employer and employee payments for health insurance. \u201cUnclaimed depreciation, net operating losses and inventories and credits accumulated through 2016\u201d could also be deducted, although it would no longer allow for deductions or exemptions on business sales to nonprofits or governments.\n\nThe corporate income tax, payroll taxes for Social Security and Medicare, the estate tax and the gift tax would all be eliminated under the plan.\n\n\u201cMost of the revenue loss would stem from repealing payroll taxes ($12.2 trillion), cutting individual income taxes ($11.9 trillion), and eliminating the corporate income tax ($3.5 trillion),\u201d the analysis reads. \u201cThe VAT would raise $19.2 trillion over the decade, offsetting only 70 percent of the cost of the tax cuts.\u201d\n\nThe Washington Post reports much of the lost revenue could be made up through spending cuts and the repeal of Obamacare.\n\nOf the Republican 2016 field, Donald Trump\u2019s plan is the only proposal that would increase the deficit more than Cruz\u2019s proposal, raising it by an estimated $9.5 trillion over the course of 10 years.\n\nDo You Support Ted Cruz's 10% Flat Tax Proposal?
