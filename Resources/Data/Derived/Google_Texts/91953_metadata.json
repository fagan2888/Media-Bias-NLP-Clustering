Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, Gary Peters of Michigan, and Ron Wyden of Oregon announced their backing of the accord Tuesday, garnering the support needed to prevent a resolution of disapproval from making it to the White House.\n\nBut according to Politico, it\u2019s not clear if the 41 Democrats will stick together and actually filibuster the disapproval legislation later this week.\n\nIndeed, some of the president\u2019s fellow Democrats who have announced their support for the Iran deal have promised to allow an up-or-down vote on the disapproval resolution.\n\nAlso today, Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., broke from the majority in his party, announcing his opposition to the agreement.\n\nIran has shown no signs of changing its \u201cdeplorable\u201d behavior, Manchin said in a statement, specifically in its long history of sponsoring terrorism, and the accord \u201cdoes nothing to guarantee\u201d a shift in the regime\u2019s actions.\n\nHe said the estimated $100 billion Tehran will receive in sanctions relief under the agreement will be used in part to continue funding terrorism, further destabilizing the region.\n\nHe also expressed concerns of cheating, adding that if Iran violates the accord, he has \u201cgrave doubts that we will have unified, committed partners willing to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon.\u201d\n\nManchin is the fourth Democrat to reject the deal, joining Sens. Chuck Schumer of New York, Bob Menendez of New Jersey, and Ben Cardin of Maryland.\n\nSen. Maria Cantwell of Washington is the only Democratic senator still undecided.\n\nAll 54 Republicans are expected to reject the accord.\n\nCongress reconvenes Tuesday and has until Sept. 17 to vote on the deal.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Democrats cinched the 41 votes needed to prevent a resolution of disapproval from making it to the White House.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Democrats cinched the 41 votes needed to prevent a resolution of disapproval from making it to the White House.", "title": "Senate Democrats Secure Crucial 41 Votes for Iran Deal", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150908_ManchinIran_Johnson_SS.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-09-08T23:06:24+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1IWfVlD"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Democrats cinched the 41 votes needed to prevent a resolution of disapproval from making it to the White House.", "title": "Senate Democrats Secure Crucial 41 Votes for Iran Deal", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150908_ManchinIran_Johnson_SS.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Featured Topics", "tag": "middle east", "published_time": "2015-09-08T14:08:54+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-09-08T23:06:24+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Iran deal, Joe Manchin, resolution of disapproval, Barack Obama, Chuck Schumer, Bob Menendez"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0aa8\"", "article_summary": "Democrats today cinched the 41 votes needed to filibuster the Republican-led effort to send a rejection of the Iran nuclear agreement to President Barack Obama\u2019s desk.\nIndeed, some of the president\u2019s fellow Democrats who have announced their support for the Iran deal have promised to allow an up-or-down vote on the disapproval resolution.\nBut according to Politico, it\u2019s not clear if the 41 Democrats will stick together and actually filibuster the disapproval legislation later this week.\nCongress reconvenes Tuesday and has until Sept. 17 to vote on the deal.\nAlso today, Sen.
