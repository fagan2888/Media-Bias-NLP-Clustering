Mumbai has always been the most expensive city in India, where real estate prices compete with other Asian property hotspots like Hong Kong and Singapore. And big ticket deals that make it to the headlines in India are almost always from Mumbai.

Home to Bollywood, one of the largest movie industries in the world, and the headquarters of some of the largest Indian corporates, Mumbai has seen several multi-million dollar property deals this year. The biggest so far is the 7.5 billion rupees [$113 million] paid by an industrialist for a 50,000 square-foot property in one of the city's posh areas, according to Colliers India.

Movie stars and cricketers also hit the limelight while shopping for high-end properties, priced at upwards of 300 million rupees ($4.5 million), in the heart of the city.

"These are one-off deals by billionaires who can afford it, there is no depth in the market. For most people, the cost of real estate is unrealistic, compared to what they earn," Vivek Talwar, a real estate investor, said.

As a result, those already invested in the market are finding it difficult to sell and builders of new condominiums are desperately offering freebies such foreign holidays and free parking to little effect.

"Today customers are not running after anybody, you have to offer around 15-20 percent discount to get a deal done," said Talwar, adding that only apartments in the range of $45,000-$65,000 in far flung suburbs of Mumbai were selling. Other than that, the sales scene is dire.
