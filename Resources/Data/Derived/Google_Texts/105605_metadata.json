Obama missed more than 64 percent of votes in 2008, and Kerry missed even more \u2014 nearly 90 percent \u2014 in 2004.\n\nFULL QUESTION\n\nRubio claimed last night that Obama & Kerry missed 60 to 70 percent of their Senate votes when they ran for president. What are the facts?\n\nFULL ANSWER\n\nSen. Marco Rubio of Florida has missed nearly 34 percent of the U.S. Senate votes in 2015, partly due to campaigning for the Republican nomination for president.\n\nSome of his constituents are not happy about it.\n\nSouthern Florida\u2019s Sun-Sentinel, which endorsed Rubio for the U.S. Senate in 2010, published an editorial on Oct. 27 with the headline \u201cMarco Rubio should resign, not rip us off.\u201d\n\nSun-Sentinel, Oct. 27: You are paid $174,000 per year to represent us, to fight for us, to solve our problems. Plus you take a $10,000 federal subsidy \u2014 declined by some in the Senate \u2014 to participate in one of the Obamacare health plans, though you are a big critic of Obamacare. You are ripping us off, senator.\n\nDuring CNBC\u2019s Republican debate on Oct. 28, moderator Carl Quintanilla asked Rubio about the newspaper\u2019s criticism. Rubio said that the editorial was \u201cevidence of the bias that exists in the American media today,\u201d and noted that the paper had previously endorsed two Democrats, Secretary of State John Kerry and President Barack Obama, who both ran for president while serving in the U.S. Senate and missed even more votes than Rubio has.\n\nQuintanilla, Oct. 28: So when the Sun-Sentinel says Rubio should resign, not rip us off, when they say Floridians sent you to Washington to do a job, when they say you act like you hate your job, do you? Rubio: Let me say, I read that editorial today with a great amusement. It\u2019s actually evidence of the bias that exists in the American media today. Quintanilla: Well, do you hate your job? Rubio: Let me \u2014 let me answer your question on the Sun-Sentinel editorial today. Back in 2004, one of my predecessors to the Senate by the name of Bob Graham, a Democrat, ran for president missing over 30 percent of his votes. I don\u2019t recall them calling for his resignation \u2014 Quintanilla: Is that the standard? Rubio: Later that year, in 2004, John Kerry ran for president missing close to 60 to 70 percent of his votes. I don\u2019t recall the Sun \u2014 in fact, the Sun-Sentinel endorsed him. In 2008, Barack Obama missed 60 or 70 percent of his votes, and the same newspaper endorsed him again. So this is another example of the double standard that exists in this country between the mainstream media and the conservative movement.\n\nA few readers have asked us if Rubio was right about the percentage of votes missed by Obama and Kerry. In short, yes, he was.\n\nWhile campaigning for the Democratic nomination in 2008, then-Sen. Obama of Illinois missed 64.3 percent of votes in calendar year 2008, according to the website GovTrack.us, which tracks missed votes by members of Congress.\n\nObama, who announced he was running for president in February 2007, missed 37.6 percent of votes that year. So, over the nearly two years that Obama was a candidate for president, he missed 46.3 percent of votes in the Senate.\n\nAnd he still got the Sun-Sentinel\u2018s endorsement in 2008, as Rubio said.\n\nIn comparison, Sen. John McCain, who was the Republican nominee for president in 2008, missed 80.5 percent of votes that year, and 55.9 percent of votes the year before that.\n\nJohn Kerry, who was the Democratic nominee for president in 2004, missed 89.8 percent of the votes that year, while he was still a U.S. senator for Massachusetts. Kerry also missed 64.1 percent of votes in 2003, but he didn\u2019t formally announce he was seeking the Democratic nomination until September of that year.\n\nThe Sun-Sentinel still endorsed Kerry over President George W. Bush.\n\nRubio also mentioned Bob Graham, a former U.S. senator for Florida, who briefly ran for the Democratic nomination for president in the 2004 cycle.\n\nGraham was officially a candidate from May 2003 until October 2003, when he dropped out of the race. He missed 32.5 percent of the Senate votes that year.\n\nBut while the Sun-Sentinel may not have complained about Graham missing votes \u2014 as far as we could find \u2014 other newspapers certainly have been critical of Republican and Democratic senators for missing votes while pursuing the White House, as the Washington Post\u2018s Philip Bump pointed out on Oct. 30.\n\nRubio, at 33.7 percent, has missed the most votes this year of the five senators currently seeking the presidency. And Sen. Bernie Sanders, at 3.4 percent, has missed the fewest.\n\nIn between them are Sens. Lindsey Graham, Ted Cruz and Rand Paul, who as of Oct. 31 have missed 26.9 percent, 23.8 percent and 4.8 percent, respectively.\n\nWe should point out that Rubio gave the percentage of missed floor votes by Kerry and Obama in election years (2004 and 2008, respectively). Those figures \u2014 \u201c60 to 70 percent,\u201d as Rubio said \u2014 cannot be compared with the percentage of votes missed in an off-election year.\n\nIn order to make an apples-to-apples comparison, we calculated the percentage of missed votes through the first nine months of the year before the general election year for the senators currently running for president and those who won their parties\u2019 nominations in 2004 and 2008.\n\nBelow is a chart showing those percentages. By this measure, Rubio missed a higher percentage of votes than Obama, but not higher than Kerry.\n\nSouth Florida Sun-Sentinel. \u201cMarco Rubio should resign, not rip us off.\u201d 27 Oct 2015.\n\nSouth Florida Sun-Sentinel. \u201cElect Marco Rubio to the U.S. Senate.\u201d 17 Oct 2010.\n\nSouth Florida Sun-Sentinel. \u201cChoose Kerry.\u201d 17 Oct 2004.\n\nSouth Florida Sun-Sentinel. \u201cMake it President Barrack Obama.\u201d 26 Oct 2008.\n\nBump, Philip. \u201cThe problem with Marco Rubio\u2019s defense of his missed votes.\u201d Washington Post. 30 Oct 2015.\n\nSen.
