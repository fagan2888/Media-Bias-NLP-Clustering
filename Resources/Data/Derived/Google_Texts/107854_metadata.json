One attack came on Sept. 26, CrowdStrike says, the day after President Barack Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping announced their deal in the White House Rose Garden. CrowdStrike, which employs former FBI and National Security Agency cyberexperts, did not name the corporate victims, citing client confidentiality. And the company says it detected and thwarted the attacks before any corporate secrets were stolen.\n\nThe day of the September meeting President Obama said the two leaders agreed that neither government \"will conduct or knowingly support the cyber-enabled theft of intellectual property, including trade secrets or other confidential business information for commercial advantage.\"\n\nCrowdStrike\u2019s timeline of recent attempted attacks may show that the Chinese did nothing but pay lip service to the Obama administration on this matter. And worse, they\u2019re ongoing. The company said that \u201cmany of the China-affiliated actors [are] persistently attempting to regain access to victim networks even in the face of repeated failures.\"\n\nIn addressing whether these intrusions mean the cyber agreement between the U.S. and China failed, Alperovich said it \u201cdepends on what is done about it and how long the current situation persists.\u201d\n\nThe delay in execution of the agreement is somewhat understandable, he continued, but going forward it needs to be made clear what the \u201cparameters for success\u201d are. In other words, what was the timeframe for implementation?\n\nEven if that is cleared up, however, the U.S. government and all private cybersecurity companies must remain vigilant.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Not exactly surprising. .05/26/2016 0:37:59AM EST.", "author": "Leah Barkoukis", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Not exactly surprising.", "title": "Day After Agreement on Cybersecurity Between US and China, Security Firm Reports Cyberattack From China", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/leahbarkoukis/2015/10/19/day-after-agreement-on-cybersecurity-between-us-and-china-security-firm-reports-cyberattack-from-china-n2067928", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015/292/b8bafbdd-5f01-495a-948a-88b5d183b546.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Not exactly surprising.", "title": "Day After Agreement on Cybersecurity Between US and China, Security Firm Reports Cyberattack From China", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/leahbarkoukis/2015/10/19/day-after-agreement-on-cybersecurity-between-us-and-china-security-firm-reports-cyberattack-from-china-n2067928", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015/292/b8bafbdd-5f01-495a-948a-88b5d183b546.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Day After Agreement on Cybersecurity Between US and China, Security Firm Reports Cyberattack From China , Leah Barkoukis, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2495\"", "article_summary": "The day after President Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping reached an agreement on cyber theft last month, China attempted to hack American corporate intellectual property, cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike recently announced.\nAnd the company says it detected and thwarted the attacks before any corporate secrets were stolen.\nOne attack came on Sept. 26, CrowdStrike says, the day after President Barack Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping announced their deal in the White House Rose Garden.\nCrowdStrike, which employs former FBI and National Security Agency cyberexperts, did not name the corporate victims, citing client confidentiality.\nEven if that is cleared up, however, the U.S. government and all private cybersecurity companies must remain vigilant."}
