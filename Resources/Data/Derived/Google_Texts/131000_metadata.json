Larry Lockman (R-Amherst) in 1990. Now that phrase features prominently in a new anti-Lockman mailing from the Maine Democatic Party.\n\nApparently Lockman's political career has been dotted with controversial commentary. In February, Bangor Daily News writer Mike Tipping noted that Lockman\u2014a first-term representative who has \"quickly established himself as a vocal leader\" of the Maine GOP's tea party wing\u2014was once active in campaigning against income taxes but switched focus in the mid-1980s to HIV fearmongering and denouncing gay men. In one 1987 letter to the Lewiston Sun Journal, Lockman wrote:\n\nIn the overwhelming majority of cases, people are dying because of their addiction to sodomy. They are dying because progressive, enlightened, tolerant people in politics and in medicine have assured the public that the practice of sodomy is a legitimate alternative lifestyle, rather than a perverted, depraved crime against humanity.\n\nHe also called anal sex \"biologically-insane\" and the \"normalization of homosexuality\" one of the most pressing moral issues of our time. In the early 1990s, Lockman became highly concerned with protesting abortion. A letter-to-the-editor of the Lewiston Sun Journal quotes Lockman saying the following:\n\nIf a woman has (the right to abortion), why shouldn\u2019t a man be free to use his superior strength to force himself on a woman? At least the rapist\u2019s pursuit of sexual freedom doesn\u2019t (in most cases) result in anyone\u2019s death.\n\nA woman's bodily autonomy comes second to either an embryo's or a man's claims on it, but certainly somebody other than the woman herself has a right to it, of that much Lockman is certain! (And can we just pause to recognize the utter creepiness of the phrase \"the rapist\u2019s pursuit of sexual freedom\"?)\n\nAfter the Bangor Daily News column came out, Lockman released a statment saying \"I have always been passionate about my beliefs, and years ago I said things that I regret. ... today I am focused on ensuring freedom and economic prosperity for all Mainers.\"", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "If a woman has the right to an abortion a man should \"be free to use his superior strength to force himself\" on her said state Rep.
