While the release of undercover videos by an antiabortion activist group fueled conservative outrage toward Planned Parenthood over the summer, even some of the most conservative House members had backed away in recent weeks from calls to defund the group entirely.\n\nFederal funding for abortions is already banned, and the proposal to bar Planned Parenthood from drawing on Medicaid or family-planning grant funds to pay for non-abortion health care would prompt Democrats to join together to block the spending bill, spurring a possible government shutdown.\n\nMeanwhile, Republicans on Capitol Hill have moved to channel conservative outrage over Planned Parenthood in other directions. A special investigative panel was created in October, and the Senate on Thursday is set to pass a budget \u201creconciliation\u201d bill that is expected to reach Obama\u2019s desk, where it will be vetoed because it includes a repeal of the Affordable Health Care Act.\n\nAnd all that was in the works before last Friday\u2019s killings at a Planned Parenthood clinic in Colorado, which has put antiabortion politicians on the defensive.\n\n[Before Colorado shooting, a trail of allegations of violence against women]\n\nA House Republican aide, responding to Pelosi\u2019s comments, said, \u201cThe main focus for action on Planned Parenthood is with the Senate and the reconciliation bill, which they will vote on this week or next.\u201d\n\nIn an interview Thursday, Planned Parenthood President Cecile Richard said she welcomed the move. \u201cCertainly any standing down of this very aggressive attack against women\u2019s health access is a good sign,\u201d she said. \u201cI do think that it is a further illustration, though, that the actions they are taking in Washington are 100 percent political. \u2026 Access to women\u2019s health care is a completely nonpartisan issue.\u201d\n\nWhile a provision totally defunding Planned Parenthood might no longer be on the table, conservatives are pushing for other related measures. One that has gained significant traction among House conservatives would allow states to individually decide whether to exclude Planned Parenthood from Medicaid reimbursements. That measure, however, would face equally stiff opposition from Hill Democrats and President Obama, making it highly unlikely to end up in the final bill.\n\n\u201cFor most of the riders to succeed, I\u2019m probably going to have some support on the other side,\u201d said Rep. Tom Cole (R-Okla.), a senior appropriator, said Wednesday. \u201cThe ones that are strictly R vs. D, that\u2019s just harder because we\u2019ve got to be able to get this bill to the floor in the Senate and we\u2019ve got to have a presidential signature.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The defunding rider is not in omnibus spending bill, but other provisions could still be on the table.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/madebonis", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "The defunding rider is not in omnibus spending bill, but other provisions could still be on the table.", "title": "Pelosi: Republicans have already caved in spending fight over Planned Parenthood", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2015/12/03/pelosi-republicans-have-already-caved-in-spending-fight-over-planned-parenthood/", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2015/09/17/Interactivity/Images/2015-09-08T052443Z_01_LJJ002_RTRIDSP_3_USA-PLANNEDPARENTHOOD.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@mikedebonis"}, "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "Planned Parenthood, Congress, shutdown, Nancy Pelosi", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/madebonis"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "Planned Parenthood, Congress, shutdown, Nancy Pelosi"}, "article_summary": "Meanwhile, Republicans on Capitol Hill have moved to channel conservative outrage over Planned Parenthood in other directions.\nAnd all that was in the works before last Friday\u2019s killings at a Planned Parenthood clinic in Colorado, which has put antiabortion politicians on the defensive.\nOne that has gained significant traction among House conservatives would allow states to individually decide whether to exclude Planned Parenthood from Medicaid reimbursements.\n\u201cCertainly any standing down of this very aggressive attack against women\u2019s health access is a good sign,\u201d she said.\nHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) told Reuters on Wednesday that Republicans \u201chad purposefully taken the Planned Parenthood language out\u201d of their latest proposal for a massive government spending bill that must be passed ahead of a Dec. 11 deadline."}
