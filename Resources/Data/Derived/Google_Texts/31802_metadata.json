He served about 17 months at a minimum-security prison camp and three to four months in a halfway house, wearing an electronic monitor, he said at the board\u2019s meeting in Deerfield Beach.\n\nSettlement of the licensure case calls for a reprimand, $15,000 fine, three years\u2019 probation with indirect supervision by another physician, and courses in ethics. In addition, Massam will provide 300 hours of free services to indigent patients, said Diane Kiesling, who acted as prosecutor for the Department of Health on the licensure case.\n\n\u201cThere is no question about his clinical abilities,\u201d she told the board. \u201cIt seems a good way to give back.\u201d\n\nAt the time of his sentencing two years ago, Highlands Today reported that Massam wired the money to a bank in Austria and used it for expenses related to his divorce.\n\nNearly three dozen cases are on the board\u2019s agenda on Friday. Typically, most are resolved through a negotiated settlement between the doctor's attorney and the DOH prosecutors, as long as the Board of Medicine agrees.\n\n--Health News Florida is part of WUSF Public Media.
