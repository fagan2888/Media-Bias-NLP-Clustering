He did not have insurance at the time of his health crisis. The hospital\u2019s decision is final, according to the Texas Advanced Directive Act, which has been on the books since 1999.\n\nDunn suffers from an apparent non-cancerous mass on his pancreas that impacts the connection of his small intestine to the pancreas. His liver and kidneys are also negatively impacted, increasingly so after eight weeks of this fight between the hospital and Dunn\u2019s mother, Evelyn.\n\nThe decision by Houston Methodist triggered a 10-day notice before life-sustaining care was to be removed. The removal has been delayed twice by the courts while the constitutionality of the Texas Advanced Directive Act is challenged.\n\nNonetheless, the pro-life community is appalled by the hospital\u2019s actions and is acting by calling attention to Dunn\u2019s case and petitioning the hospital to change course.\n\n\u201cAt this hospital and hospitals around the state, we see that they have a different philosophy. They\u2019re using this law to cover up that anti-life ethic and actually to make these decisions against the wishes of the patient,\u201d said Texas Right to Life Legislative Director John Seago.\n\nBut in addition to denying treatment, Seago said the hospital is also refusing Dunn to get treatment anywhere else.\n\n\u201cThe law only gives you 10 days, so if an ethics committee decides they want to take away the treatment, they only give the family 10 days to transfer to another facility,\u201d he explained. \u201cThat is extremely difficult because the hospital decided they don\u2019t want to treat the patient anymore. However, you can\u2019t transfer without their help.\u201d\n\nGet the hottest, most important news stories on the Internet \u2013 delivered FREE to your inbox as soon as they break!

Out of respect for the family and because of patient privacy laws, we cannot discuss the particulars of the case. We are providing the best possible care to the patient and we continue to care for him. We are working with the courts to get guidance on who has legal guardianship of the patient.\n\n\u201cWithin the patient\u2019s family there is disagreement on the appropriate end-of-life care for this patient. We feel strongly that every decision we have made is in the best interest of the patient, and the Houston Methodist staff works hard and compassionately every day to help families who are facing difficult end-of-life issues. Houston Methodist is a faith-based, values-centered organization that strives to make the best choices for all our patients. We will continue assisting the family through this painful process.\u201d\n\nWhile Dunn\u2019s family succeeded in winning a couple of court-ordered delays against the hospital, Seago said the hospital tried to play some stunning hardball of its own by requesting that Evelyn Dunn be stripped of medical power of attorney for her son.\n\n\u201cThe hospital is actually trying to take that right away from her,\u201d he said. \u201cShe has the medical power of attorney, and we see that the hospital wants someone else to be the medical guardian and to make medical decisions for Chris. We know that the first medical decision that they\u2019ll make, if they get it, is to withdraw his ventilator, which will occasion his death.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very disturbing that Houston Methodist Hospital is not just trying to use this unethical law, but they\u2019re actually going above and beyond, to take the decision-making authority out of the hands of Chris\u2019 mother,\u201d Seago said.\n\nHe said it\u2019s even more baffling when considering Evelyn Dunn is merely enforcing the decisions Chris himself is making.\n\n\u201cHe is capable of making his own medical decisions, but because he has a tube, he can\u2019t verbally say them,\u201d Seago said. \u201cHe can indicate with his head. He shakes his head \u2018yes\u2019 or \u2018no.\u2019 He uses his hands to indicate whether he wants something or not. He is communicative, but because he can\u2019t speak verbally, he has to have a surrogate speak on his behalf.\u201d\n\nIn the following video posted by Texas Right to Life titled \u201cHelp Chris See Christmas,\u201d Dunn can be seen pleading with attorneys to help him remain alive:\n\nIn addition to championing Dunn\u2019s case, Seago said Texas Right to Life is getting ready to fight for a repeal of the Texas Advanced Directive Act.\n\n\u201cThis hospital is using a legal process that we have to withdraw life-sustaining treatment, even if the patient and family are asking for it,\u201d Seago said. \u201cAt Texas Right to Life, we consider this Texas Advanced Directive Act to be the black spot on our state\u2019s pro-life record.\u201d\n\nGet the hottest, most important news stories on the Internet \u2013 delivered FREE to your inbox as soon as they break!
