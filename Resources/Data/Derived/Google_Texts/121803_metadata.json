I thought the \u201cliberalism is a mental disorder\u201d meme came close, but in the end was too easy. It\u2019s like having a madman as a villain in a story\u2013you don\u2019t have to explain, motivate or justify his behavior. It\u2019s the difference between \u201cFriday the 13th\u201d and \u201cCrime and Punishment.\u201d\n\nA recent sad experience with a friend undergoing rehab has left me with another analogue. I now think liberalism is an addiction and displays all the behaviors commonly associated with addictive behavior.\n\nWell, not \u201cliberalism\u201d per se. That policy-agenda is really an elaborate metaphorical delusion built to camouflage the true drug these poor souls crave so desperately: moral superiority.\n\nIt\u2019s as powerful as heroin or cocaine. It supplies a terrific high: all sense of personal failure, betrayal, guilt, ineffectiveness, irrelevance, of being nothing and nobody, disappears in a flash. Instead our hero feels extraordinarily good about himself. He is helping. He is compassionate. He is without sin. He is sensitive, caring, part of the solution and not the problem. He feels handsome, daring and heroic. He thinks it will get him laid. How could he not love this?\n\nHe cannot see the harm he is doing, either at the micro level or at the cataclysmic macro level; he cannot see how his \u201cgenerosity\u201d with other people\u2019s money, for example, has devastated the black community, turned it bitter, hopeless, impulsive, violent and addicted itself to free stuff from the gub\u2019mint as well as the crutch of \u201cracis\u201d to justify everything.\n\nBut you have seen this most explicitly in the last few weeks, as Obamacare, a hopelessly idiotic delusional program meant to redistribute wealth (in the form of medical care) to the unfortunates who\u2019ve never paid a tax in their lives, has crashed and burned. As anybody who knows anything about the addictive state knows, when the addict is threatened with the cut-off of his supply, he becomes a monster.\n\nI saw this with my friend, who it turned out had been lying to me for years about his addictions. He loved me; I kept him alive. But he could not help himself from using me and feeding me a tapestry of lies to keep the money coming. I thought I was \u201chelping,\u201d just as liberals think they are helping. But I learned, finally, that I was just enabling. This is a lesson liberals will never learn.\n\nAs the collapse of Obamacare reveals, they go into reflexive monster mode. Like any addict, they will lie, cheat, steal, even become violent when their supply is threatened. They have no moral qualms about betraying their closest friends because the moral part of them is dead. They see only the end of their high and that becomes the defining issue of their life. They will do anything to protect it. That is why they are such wily opponents and such aggressive defenders of what the whole of the rational world now realizes was fabrication, delusion and ultimately fantasy.\n\nSo if we look to liberate them from the agony they don\u2019t even know they suffer from, we must look to the known cures of addiction. Terrible, hard work, draining and demoralizing, but I think we are up to it.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Power Line", "description": "A distinguished writer and friend whom we greatly admire writes with timely thoughts based on painful experience, submitted for your consideration: I\u2019m always searching for a unified field th\u2026", "title": "A new theory of liberalism", "url": "http://on.powerlineblog.com/archives/2013/11/a-new-theory-of-liberalism.php", "image": "http://www.powerlineblog.com/wp-content/themes/powerline/images/icon.png", "locale": "en_US", "type": "powerlineblog:article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@powerlineus", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "NOODP", "wp-parsely_version": "1.7", "fb": {"admins": "505151,john.hinderaker,scottwynnjohnson,750972908", "app_id": 154257474630565}, "article": {"published_time": "2013-11-02T19:34:43+00:00", "modified_time": "2013-11-02T21:56:17+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "I now think liberalism is an addiction and displays all the behaviors commonly associated with addictive behavior.\nI thought the \u201cliberalism is a mental disorder\u201d meme came close, but in the end was too easy.\nA distinguished writer and friend whom we greatly admire writes with timely thoughts based on painful experience, submitted for your consideration:I\u2019m always searching for a unified field theory of liberalism that reconciles its craziness, destructiveness and sanctimony.\nWell, not \u201cliberalism\u201d per se.\nI saw this with my friend, who it turned out had been lying to me for years about his addictions."}
