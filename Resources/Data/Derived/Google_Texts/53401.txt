The NFL released its statement Tuesday on Broncos kicker Matt Prater’s suspension. Here is the full statement:

“Matt Prater of the Denver Broncos has been suspended without pay for the first four games of the 2014 regular season for violating the NFL Policy and Program for Substances of Abuse.

“Prater will be eligible to return to the Broncos’ active roster on Monday, October 6 following the team’s October 5 game against the Arizona Cardinals.

“Prater is eligible to participate in all offseason and preseason practices and games.”

The 30-year-old kicker violated the league’s substance-abuse policy. The violation was alcohol-related. Prater has been in the league’s alcohol program since soon after he was charged with driving under the influence Aug. 12, 2011. He had also been arrested for DUI in 2008, in Orlando, and is barred from drinking alcohol while in the intervention program.

The four-game suspension, which is expected to be announced Monday, was part of an agreement reached between Prater’s attorney, Harvey Steinberg, and the league, so an appeal is not expected. The NFL had initially threatened a one-year suspension.
