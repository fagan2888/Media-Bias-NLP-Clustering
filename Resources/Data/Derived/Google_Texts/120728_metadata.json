At least 27 freight cars derailed and lost their cargo.\n\nFirefighter Rodney Mullis, spokesman for the Hudson Fire District, said the train jumped the tracks as it headed through the farming town of 2,300 people early Sunday, damaging rail crossings.\n\nNone of the cars overturned until the train got south of town on Colorado\u2019s sparsely populated Eastern Plains. \u201cWe\u2019re thankful none of the cars came off the tracks in town and hit any houses,\u201d he said.\n\nMullis said there was no environmental impact, and front-end loaders will be used to clean up the coal that spilled.\n\nSloan said the railway has a number of options until the tracks are cleared, including sending trains through Cheyenne.\n\nHe said little impact is expected on interstate commerce. \u201cCold weather is ending and the demand at coal plants is tapering off. Some of them already have coal in stockpiles. They can also get coal from other sources,\u201d Sloan said.\n\nThere was no timetable for when the damaged track might reopen.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Coal train derails near Hudson, no injuries", "title": "Coal train derails near Hudson, no injuries", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/03/22/coal-train-derails-near-hudson-no-injuries/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150322__derailp1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150322__derailp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2015-03-22T11:24:20+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-25T00:58:00+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3ae9\"", "article_summary": "HUDSON \u2014 A train jumped its tracks early Sunday, dumping tons of coal from more than two dozen cars near the northern Colorado town of Hudson.\nBurlington Northern Santa Fe Railway Co. spokesman Joe Sloan didn\u2019t provide an estimate on how much coal was dumped in the accident.\nThere were 120 cars on the train carrying 17,000 tons of coal, he said.\nNo injuries were reported, but there was significant damage to the tracks, which have been shut down for repairs and cleanup.\nNone of the cars overturned until the train got south of town on Colorado\u2019s sparsely populated Eastern Plains."}
