Obama lied to us.\u201d\n\nInstead, Cleek said, \u201cIt\u2019s about control, about the government controlling our lives.\u201d He is quick to say that the Affordable Care Act cannot be immediately overturned, however.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t pull the rug out from people who are insured,\u201d Cleek said.\n\nThe candidate Name: Dr. Eugene Cleek\n\nAge: 67\n\nEducation: Undergraduate degree from Whittier College; medical degree from Autonomous University of Guadalajara in Mexico; post-graduate study at the University of California, Irvine; five-year residency at the Atlanta Medical Center in Georgia.\n\nOccupation: Trauma surgeon and medical director of the Enloe Hospital Trauma and Emergency Surgery Program in Chico.\n\nEndorsements: Cleek reported that he\u2019s been endorsed by \u201cmost all of the counties in the district. . . . Every (GOP) central committee that can endorse us has endorsed us,\u201d but some of the central committees haven\u2019t met yet.\n\nPlatform issues:\n\n* Simplify the tax system, and lower individual and corporate tax rates.\n\n* Develop new sources of clean, reliable energy while minimizing bureaucratic red-tape for entrepreneurial innovators.\n\n* Supports an amendment to the Constitution which forces Congress to live within its means.\n\n* Protect freedom, secure borders and maintain a strong armed forces.\n\nBut in his estimation, \u201cThat\u2019s not what is ruining medicine so badly.\u201d Instead, the problem is that \u201cthe doctor-patient relationship is now the patient-government-doctor relationship, and that works very poorly. . . . Why does the government come in and tell me how to do surgery?\u201d\n\nCleek added, \u201cThe closer we get to the people\u2019s needs, the better we do.\u201d\n\nThis philosophy squares with his ideas on farming, as well.\n\nCleek\u2019s family arrived in Northern California in 1850, homesteading the land in 1864 and building the first frame house in Glenn County.\n\n\u201cWe are solid into the land,\u201d Cleek said, adding, \u201cNobody cares about that land more than the farmers that own it. We need to turn farmers loose without restrictive regulations and let them farm the land.\u201d\n\nOn his family\u2019s land \u2013 where he and his wife of 38 years, Laurel, raised five children \u2013 \u201cWe farm walnuts, almonds, pecans and a few other little things,\u201d Cleek said, with evident pride. He mentioned that he\u2019d \u201chad his hands in the dirt\u201d as recently as the day before this interview.\n\nSchools and skills\n\nWith regard to education, Cleek again proposes less federal intervention. He believes, \u201cSchools are best run by local school boards, with parents and local communities developing curriculum and testing standards for their students.\u201d\n\nAs for higher education, the costs need to be more affordable for students, he said, and colleges and universities that receive federal tax dollars need to be more accountable \u201cfor their costs, and there must be greater financial transparency so that students and parents can make well-informed decisions regarding higher education.\u201d\n\nCleek also wants better avenues for training in skilled trades, such as paths that lead to careers as mechanics, electricians and plumbers.\n\n\u201cNot everyone wants to go to college,\u201d he said.\n\nCleek believes that he is not alone in being \u201cfed up\u201d with career politicians.\n\n\u201cWe need citizens who\u2019ve worked and understand what it takes to make the country real and what we have to do to make it happen,\u201d he said.\n\nHe challenges the notion that his lack of prior experience is a hindrance to being elected.\n\n\u201cIf you shoot for nothing, you hit it every time,\u201d Cleek said.\n\nHe explained that part of what has motivated him to run for his first elected office since high school \u2013 he was student body president at Orland High School \u2013 is a desire to \u201cbring back America to where it is supposed to be,\u201d believing that doing so is rooted in \u201cnot what\u2019s right for me, but what\u2019s right for the United States.\u201d\n\nCleek also said that \u201cI\u2019ve made zero political promises. My commitment is to do the right thing every time, regardless of consequences.\u201d\n\nSuccess breeds success\n\nHe believes that his prior successes in life \u2013 which includes being an Army surgeon in the Gulf War and caring for wounded soldiers and POWs along the borders of Iraq and Saudi Arabia, as well as 13 years in the Army Reserves \u2013 might be a fitting background to succeed in Congress.\n\n\u201cMaybe we need someone like me who doesn\u2019t need to prove anything,\u201d Cleek said.\n\nCleek also doesn\u2019t completely embrace the distinction of being the Republican candidate.\n\n\u201cWhen people ask me what party I am, I say \u2018I\u2019m an American,\u2019 \u201d he said.\n\nIndeed, if elected, Cleek plans to work with Democrats, Republicans and independents.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to represent them all,\u201d he said.\n\nThe 3rd Congressional District includes the vast majority of Solano County but not the cities of Benicia and Vallejo.\n\nReach Tanya Perez at 530-747-8082 or [email protected].
