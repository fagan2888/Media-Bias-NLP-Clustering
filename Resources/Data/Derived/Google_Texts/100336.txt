A $100 billion-plus budget can look like a locomotive barreling down the track, but what about the caboose?

That’s the Capitol Square term for any adjustments to the budget for the rest of the current fiscal year, which ends June 30.

The Governor’s number crunchers believe that the way taxes and transfer payments have been rolling in, the state has a bit more than $435 million to spend this year (for a total of $47.8 billion). About two-thirds is from federal payments, taxes and user fees designated for specific purposes.

Some of the biggest changes from the state’s original plan for fiscal year 2016:

* A $337 million increase over the original plan for highway construction, to $2.2 billion. This is up from $1.5 billion in fiscal year 2015. In addition, McAuliffe’s caboose calls for (a) an additional $16 million over plan for highway maintenance, to $1.57 billion, a figure that’s still below fiscal year 2015, (b) an additional $6.1 million, to $41.2 million for toll facilities and (c) another $30 million of assistance to localities for transit, bringing that total to $923.9 million.

* Medicaid spending (split 50/50 between the state and federal governments) would rise $343 million from the original plan for fiscal year 2016 to $8.8 billion. This is $701 million more than fiscal 2015. The state’s share of the increase from plan is $172 million. Medicaid officials have reported higher than expected enrollment, probably when people asking about Obamacare learn that their kids are eligible for Medicaid.

*Another $141 million (to $1.76 billion) for public employee health benefits

*A cut of $34 million in state payments to local school systems to fund the minimal Standards of Quality required by state law. (To $5.73 billion; this is still $243 million more than SOQ payments in fiscal year 2015.)

* An increase of $27 million (to $131.6 million) for administrative and support at the Department of Social Services

* Children’s protective services get an $18 million boost from the original plan (and from fiscal year 2015 spending, to reach $288 million)

* A $14.3 million increase, to $45.8 million for the rehabilitative industries section of the Department for the Blind and Vision Impaired.

*An additional $11.2 million (to $61.4 million) to boost payments to local and regional jails. The caboose doesn’t say anything about the per-inmate, per-day rate, so presumably this reflects more people staying longer behind bars

* Another $8.6 million for child care subsidies (to $156 million)

*A cut of $8.2 million (to $25.5 million) for regulation of assisted living facilities, adult day care and child welfare agencies.
