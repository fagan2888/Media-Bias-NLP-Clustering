NEW YORK â€”Thousands of New Jersey commuters will start to notice changes at the George Washington Bridge Bus Station Monday morning, when work on a yearlong $183 million overhaul of the upper Manhattan depot is scheduled to begin.

The first change will take place on the top level of the building, which will now accommodate riders who are boarding and unboarding buses, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey announced on Friday. The lower levels will be closed for reconstruction work.

Apart from that change, bus service to the station will not immediately change, Port Authority officials said.

Later, riders will notice new retail space and loading areas, improved handicapped accessibility, and improved signage, lighting and better arrival and departure information.

The distinct 51-year-old station, with a modern design featuring 26 triangular roof sections made of concrete, is located on the Manhattan end of the bridge at 179th Street, in Washington Heights. The station handles about 5 million passenger-trips a year, or about 10,000 round-trip riders per weekday, the bulk of them NJ Transit riders.

In addition to space for local and national retail stores, the revamped station will include a new waiting area, new arrival and departure information screens, five additional bus gates, and an elevator from the subway and street-level below in compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act, according to the Port Authority.

The start of work follows an initial authorization of the project by Port Authority commissioners in 2011, before the agency entered into a public-private partnership in January 2013 with a company known as GWBBS Development Venture, LLC,

Work on the GWB station comes after commissioners authorized $90 million in short-term improvements to the agency's much larger Port Authority Bus Terminal in midtown last month, following demands to reduce departure delays and alleviate passenger crowding and discomfort at the terminal, which is located a block east of the Lincoln Tunnel.
