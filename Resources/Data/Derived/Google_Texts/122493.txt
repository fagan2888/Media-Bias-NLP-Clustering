Broncos owner Pat Bowlen and his family were honored during the first television timeout Sunday, just before the Broncos took their first possession of the season.

A brief video tribute was shown on the big screens at Sports Authority Field at Mile High before a live camera focused on Bowlen’s family inside the owner’s box. Bowlen and his wife have seven children.

Bowlen was not in attendance. It was the first time he missed a Broncos regular-season or playoff game since he purchased the team in 1984.

Bowlen, 70, relinquished control of the team in July after acknowledging he is dealing with Alzheimer’s disease. In his 30 years as team owner, Bowlen helped guide the Broncos to six Super Bowl appearances and two Super Bowl victories.Close call: The Broncos had a seemingly easy win ahead of them with a 24-7 lead at the half, but the Colts came on strong in the fourth quarter. The Broncos held on to win 31-24.
