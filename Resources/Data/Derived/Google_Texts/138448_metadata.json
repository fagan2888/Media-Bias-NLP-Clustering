That sounds like something Joe Rogan would make people do on Fear Factor. But according to Fox News (who surprisingly didn't blame Obamacare for this), she is determined to prove the food is healthy. Hey, it's OK lady, I'll take your word for it:\n\nDorothy Hunter started her 30-day feast of eating only the dog and cat food she sells at her Paw's Natural Pet Emporium stores in Richland and Kennewick, Wash., on June 19. \"You would be surprised how tasty dog and cat food can be when it's made right,\" she told the Tri-City Herald last week. \"You really are what you eat and it's the same for your pets. I decided to eat this food for a month just to prove how good it tastes, as well as showcase its nutrition.\"\n\nSo, what has she enjoyed eating so far? Apparently Tiki cat food got really high praise as well as Natural Balance. \"I know people think this is crazy [WHAT? NO!],\" Hunter said,\" But I can't stress enough how important it is to read labels and see what's in the food you eat \u2014 whether it's pet food or human food.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt's hard to argue with that, especially in light of recent horrible events.\n\nImage via Shutterstock.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "going to the dogs, dog food, cat food, Jezebel", "author": "Rebecca \"Burt\" Rose", "og": {"site_name": "Jezebel", "description": "A Washington pet store owner is eating nothing but the all-natural dog and cat food she sells in her stores to prove the food is just as healthy for you as it is for your pets.", "title": "A Very Brave Woman Is Eating Nothing but Dog and Cat Food for 30 Days", "url": "http://jezebel.com/a-very-brave-woman-is-eating-nothing-but-dog-and-cat-fo-1600949740", "image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s----8_Lu1C--/c_fill,fl_progressive,g_north,h_358,q_80,w_636/zxoapacwyjjtfixrxd1v.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A Washington pet store owner is eating nothing but the all-natural dog and cat food she sells in her stores to prove the food is just as healthy for you as it is for your pets.", "title": "A Very Brave Woman Is Eating Nothing but Dog and Cat Food for 30 Days", "url": "http://jezebel.com/a-very-brave-woman-is-eating-nothing-but-dog-and-cat-fo-1600949740", "image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s----8_Lu1C--/c_fill,fl_progressive,g_north,h_358,q_80,w_636/zxoapacwyjjtfixrxd1v.jpg", "site": "@jezebel", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--7IykX4GV--/c_fill,fl_progressive,g_center,h_80,q_80,w_80/pch44wvo0v6acpdlt0f6.png", "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "fb": {"app_id": 40338819712}, "dynamic-stylesheet": "//x.kinja-static.com/assets/stylesheets/editor-621051396171a9ade757cbbd77315ea6.css", "keywords": "going to the dogs, dog food, cat food, Jezebel", "google-site-verification": "y-C42IsCl0lD8sGq7_zkNy87OIpl7gFSn3Km346YC48", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--2gXbBeUI--/c_fill,fl_progressive,g_center,h_200,q_80,w_200/pch44wvo0v6acpdlt0f6.png", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=10.0", "description": "A Washington pet store owner is eating nothing but the all-natural dog and cat food she sells in her stores to prove the food is just as healthy for you as it is for your pets."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdbedf\"", "article_summary": "\"You would be surprised how tasty dog and cat food can be when it's made right,\" she told the Tri-City Herald last week.\n],\" Hunter said,\" But I can't stress enough how important it is to read labels and see what's in the food you eat \u2014 whether it's pet food or human food.\"\nApparently Tiki cat food got really high praise as well as Natural Balance.\nA Washington pet store owner is eating nothing but the all-natural dog and cat food she sells in her stores to prove the food is just as healthy for you as it is for your pets.\nBut according to Fox News (who surprisingly didn't blame Obamacare for this), she is determined to prove the food is healthy."}
