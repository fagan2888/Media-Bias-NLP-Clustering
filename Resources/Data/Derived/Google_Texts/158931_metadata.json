Blum said he supports beefing up the Central Intelligence Agency\u2019s covert operations and \u201ceyeballs on the ground in the Middle East\u201d to gain better intelligence about what is happening.\n\nBlum said our allies today could be our enemies tomorrow \u201cand use our weapons to kill our nation\u2019s finest.\u201d\n\nMurphy said the United States should not be involved in foreign countries right now given the circumstances where the nation is expected to play \u201cworld police.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe need to, one, get more information, but two, it needs to be a solution that is a Middle East solution, that Sunni, Shiites and Kurds reach a solution,\u201d Murphy said.\n\nMurphy, a former speaker of the Iowa House from Dubuque, and Blum, a Dubuque businessman, met at Coe\u2019s Sinclair Auditorium for a debate televised live on KCRG 9.2. The debate was sponsored by KCRG-TV9 and The Gazette.\n\nThe candidates are vying to replace Democrat Rep. Bruce Braley, who is running for Senate.\n\nBlum and Murphy offered contrasting views on the Ebola virus, Medicare, immigration, minimum wage and the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare.\n\nOn Ebola, Murphy said the United States needs to boost the budget of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, so the nation has the tools it needs to contain the virus.\n\nBlum said he supported banning flights to certain locations, doing screenings in airports and sending doctors to treat patients in the country of origin rather the bringing patients to U.S. soil.\n\nTurning to domestic issues, Blum said he opposes raising the federal minimum wage, saying it would cost jobs. He proposed raising a tax credit for low-income families.\n\n\u201cIf we really want to help low-income families, let\u2019s raise the earned income tax credit (and) not raise the minimum wage,\u201d Blum said.\n\nMurphy said he supports raising the minimum wage, which he said will help grow the middle class.\n\nThe candidates also discussed the militarization of police forces, which became an issue after a police shooting in Ferguson, Mo.\n\nMurphy said he supports military surplus equipment being transferred to police departments. He said he\u2019d support ending a requirement that the equipment be used or the department forfeits it.\n\n\u201cWe need to focus on getting tools through the federal government, quite frankly getting more cops on the street, and getting more information about when the equipment should be used and how it should be used,\u201d Murphy said.\n\nBlum disagreed. Police have enough firepower without military equipment, he said.\n\n\u201cI believe it is beyond the pale. Police do not need military equipment,\u201d Blum said.\n\nBlum and Murphy will meet for a second debate Oct. 18 in Waterloo.\n\nA recent poll by The Polling Company puts Blum with a 40 percent to 39 percent edge among likely voters. The poll\u2019s margin of error is 4.9 percent.", "article_metadata": {"Description": "The Gazette | CEDAR RAPIDS - Candidates for Iowa's 1st Congressional District offered slightly different views last night for how the United States should handle foreign thre", "og": {"url": "http://www.thegazette.com/subject/news/politics/election/campaigns/in-debate-blum-and-murphy-draw-contrasts-on-isis-ebola-militarized-police-20141008", "site_name": "The Gazette", "image": "http://www.thegazette.com/storyimage/GA/20141008/ARTICLE/141009670/EP/1/8/EP-141009670.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "CEDAR RAPIDS - Candidates for Iowa's 1st Congressional District offered slightly different views last night for how the United States should handle foreign threats, such as Islamic State jihadists."}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thegazette.com/subject/news/politics/election/campaigns/in-debate-blum-and-murphy-draw-contrasts-on-isis-ebola-militarized-police-20141008", "description": "CEDAR RAPIDS - Candidates for Iowa's 1st Congressional District offered slightly different views last night for how the United States should handle foreign threats, such as Islamic State jihadists.", "site": "@gazettedotcom", "title": "In debate, Blum and Murphy draw contrasts on ISIS, Ebola, militarized police"}, "fb": {"app_id": 163646090334606}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "bt": {"modDate": "2014-10-08T22:30:00-05:00", "type": "thegazette_", "pubDate": "2014-10-08T22:30:07-05:00", "title": "In debate, Blum and Murphy draw contrasts on ISIS, Ebola, militarized police"}, "MobileOptimized": 320, "apple-touch-fullscreen": "yes", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "\u201cIf we really want to help low-income families, let\u2019s raise the earned income tax credit (and) not raise the minimum wage,\u201d Blum said.\nBlum and Murphy offered contrasting views on the Ebola virus, Medicare, immigration, minimum wage and the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare.\nTurning to domestic issues, Blum said he opposes raising the federal minimum wage, saying it would cost jobs.\nBlum and Murphy will meet for a second debate Oct. 18 in Waterloo.\nIn a debate at Coe College in Cedar Rapids, Democrat Pat Murphy and Republican Rod Blum expressed reluctance to send troops to the Middle East."}
