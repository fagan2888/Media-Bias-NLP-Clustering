Nikki Haley sought to respond to Americans\u2019 frustrations with Washington in her response to President Obama\u2019s final State of the Union address, while seeking to mitigate the damage done to the Republican brand by the candidacy of Donald Trump.\n\nSelected by Speaker Paul Ryan last month, Haley represents a new face for the GOP\u2014the first woman and the first minority governor of her state\u2014who saw her star rise in the aftermath of the Charleston shooting last year and overseeing the removal of the Confederate Battle Flag from the South Carolina state capital.\n\nSign up for and more view example\n\nThe pick reflects Ryan\u2019s desire to offer a positive counterbalance to the divisive Republican primary, while reflecting the frustration with the nation\u2019s capital with the choice of someone from outside of Washington.\n\n\u201cDuring anxious times, it can be tempting to follow the siren call of the angriest voices,\u201d Haley, 43, said, alluding to the bombastic Republican front-runner. \u201cWe must resist that temptation. No one who is willing to work hard, abide by our laws, and love our traditions should ever feel unwelcome in this country.\u201d\n\nListing many of the same themes that Trump is feeding off, Haley, the daughter of Indian immigrants, argued that the GOP could take a more constructive course.\n\nRead More: Meet the Republican Giving the State of the Union Response\n\n\u201cThe President\u2019s record has often fallen far short of his soaring words,\u201d she said. \u201cAs he enters his final year in office, many Americans are still feeling the squeeze of an economy too weak to raise income levels. We\u2019re feeling a crushing national debt, a health care plan that has made insurance less affordable and doctors less available, and chaotic unrest in many of our cities. Even worse, we are facing the most dangerous terrorist threat our nation has seen since September 11th, and this president appears either unwilling or unable to deal with it. Soon, the Obama presidency will end, and America will have the chance to turn in a new direction.\u201d\n\nMark Wilson\u2014Getty Images\n\nHaley laid blame on both parties, pledging that the GOP, with Ryan now at the helm and with the prospect of a new president, would seek to restore trust.\n\n\u201cWe as Republicans need to own that truth,\u201d she said. We need to recognize our contributions to the erosion of the public trust in America\u2019s leadership. We need to accept that we\u2019ve played a role in how and why our government is broken. And then we need to fix it.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s an important lesson in this. In many parts of society today, whether in popular culture, academia, the media, or politics, there\u2019s a tendency to falsely equate noise with results,\u201d she added.\n\nHaley retold the story of the Charleston shooting, in which nine black churchgoers were killed by a white man at Bible study at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church.\n\n\u201cOur people would not allow hate to win. We didn\u2019t have violence, we had vigils. We didn\u2019t have riots, we had hugs,\u201d she said. \u201cWe removed a symbol that was being used to divide us, and we found a strength that united us against a domestic terrorist and the hate that filled him.\u201d\n\nRead More: 10 Politicos to Watch in 2016\n\nSummarizing the Republican agenda of lower taxes, reforming education, and repealing Obamacare, Haley said the country has \u201cbig decisions to make\u201d in the coming election. Seeking to put a softer tone on GOP opposition to same-sex marriage, Haley called for respect on all sides of the issue.\n\n\u201cWe would respect differences in modern families,\u201d she said, \u201cbut we would also insist on respect for religious liberty as a cornerstone of our democracy.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "South Carolina Gov.
