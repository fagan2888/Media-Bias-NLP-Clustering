Since 2009, the categories have reflected product- and service-based companies. Today, many companies are both, according to Chamber President Lori Higgins.\n\n\u201cIt was kind of like comparing apples to oranges,\u201d she said, offering the auto industry as an example. When people take their cars into the shop, they have their brakes fixed and buy new tires. The mechanics who fix their brakes perform a service, but new tires are a product, an investment, Higgins said.\n\nSo, the Chamber developed new categories honoring businesses of various sizes.\n\nBusinesses that employ one or two workers are eligible for the micro business award. If a business has between three and 20 employees on payroll, it is considered a small business by the Chamber and can win an award in that category. A business with 21 or more employees falls into the general business category, and for the first time, nonprofits received special recognition with their own award category.\n\nThe Chamber accepts nominations for the Excellence in Business Awards; businesses can self-nominate.\n\nJudges assess applicants on business performance, innovation, community involvement and job creation, according to Higgins.\n\nThis year, Char Grandell of FASTSIGNS, Dean Hancy of PC Bits and Renee Sande of Anoka County Commute Solutions served as judges.\n\nImpact Services\n\nThe first not for profit award winner was Impact Services, formerly Anoka-Champlin Meals on Wheels.\n\nImpact Services is headquartered in Coon Rapids.\n\nAt its founding in 1973, Anoka-Champlin Meals on Wheels delivered 12 meals to homebound individuals each day. Today, Impact Services coordinates the delivery of more than 100 meals throughout Anoka County each and every day, according to Steve Griffiths, executive director.\n\nIn 2013, Impact Services launched a campaign, \u201cSenior Care is a Family Affair,\u201d to be proactive, encouraging families to start thinking about the aging process early, together.\n\n\u201cWe are absolutely blessed to have a community of businesses that support us in such a great way,\u201d Griffiths said, speaking on behalf of all MetroNorth nonprofit businesses.\n\nDesigned 4 Freedom\n\nTracy David Peterson, owner of Designed 4 Freedom in Shoreview, accepted the micro business award.\n\nDesigned 4 Freedom provides professional success coaching in one-on-one sessions, corporate training sessions, workshops and more. Designed 4 Freedom has several audio training CDs on the market, too.\n\nPeterson started the business six years ago, and it has grown tremendously in that time. In 2013 alone, the business collected 1,400 success testimonies from new customers, she said.\n\n\u201cOur success in our business means others in the community are experiencing success,\u201d Peterson said.\n\nEdward Jones \u2013 Circle Pines\n\nThe small business award went to Edward Jones \u2013 Circle Pines. Financial Advisor Teresa Elmstrand accepted the award.\n\nEdward Jones is a large investment firm with more than 10,000 offices across the United States.\n\nThe Circle Pines office continues to grow, doubling its number of employer retirement plans in 2013, according to the Chamber.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to teach people that finances can be fun,\u201d Elmstrand said, explaining the premise of a recent event, \u201cFood and Finance,\u201d a cooking class that incorporated financial tips and tricks.\n\nWarners\u2019 Stellian\n\nJeff Warner accepted the general business award on behalf of Warners\u2019 Stellian, the appliance store chain.\n\nEstablished in 1971, Warners\u2019 Stellian is in its third-generation as a family business. The Warner family runs eight stores in the Twin Cities metropolitan area and Rochester.\n\nThe company is based in St. Paul.\n\n2013 brought a focus on sustainability for the company, Jeff Warner, Jr. explained in a video presented during the awards.\n\nWarners\u2019 Stellian purchased a machine that super compresses packaging materials, which are then shipped out to become packaging materials again.\n\n\u201cWe want to be a leader,\u201d Jeff Warner, Jr. said.\n\nKeynote address\n\nStewart Mills, vice president of Mills Fleet Farm, delivered the keynote address Feb. 6.\n\nMills outlined the business\u2019 progression and his career\u2019s trajectory before confronting Main Street businesses\u2019 challenges in the coming years.\n\nOne of those challenges is the Affordable Care Act, Mills said.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act reduces supply, increases demand and does nothing to affect the delivery of health care, according to Mills, so it makes no economic sense and will hurt family businesses as they will incur higher fees and taxes because of it, he said.\n\nThe U.S. tax policy in general is \u201cprohibitive,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWall Street having a great year doesn\u2019t mean that Main Street is doing well,\u201d Mills said, adding that to be successful, the U.S. will need to focus on reviving Main Street, working from the bottom up, rather than vice versa.\n\nOlivia Koester is at\n\n[email protected]", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "ABC Newspapers", "description": "The MetroNorth Chamber of Commerce presented four awards at its 20th annual Excellence in Business Awards ceremony Feb. 6 at the Majestic Oaks Golf Club in Ham Lake.", "title": "Area businesses recognized by MetroNorth Chamber of Commerce", "url": "http://ecmpublishers.com/2014/02/17/area-businesses-recognized-by-metronorth-chamber-of-commerce/", "image": "https://abcnewspapers.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2014/02/MetroNorthChamber12-300x200.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 117651516683}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, width=device-width, height=device-height, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "MetroNorth Chamber of Commerce President Lori Higgins, left, and Board Chairman Bob Schlichte, right, pose with the 2013 Excellence in Business Award winners.\nBusinesses that employ one or two workers are eligible for the micro business award.\nWarners\u2019 StellianJeff Warner accepted the general business award on behalf of Warners\u2019 Stellian, the appliance store chain.\nEdward Jones \u2013 Circle PinesThe small business award went to Edward Jones \u2013 Circle Pines.\nThe MetroNorth Chamber of Commerce presented four awards at its 20th annual Excellence in Business Awards ceremony Feb. 6 at the Majestic Oaks Golf Club in Ham Lake."}
