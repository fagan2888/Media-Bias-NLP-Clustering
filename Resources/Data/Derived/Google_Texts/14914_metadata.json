Did the hammer come down in late 2012, when Sam Carter complained of a \u201cBola\u00f1o Bubble\u201d in The New Republic? Maybe it was the July 2013 publication in English of \u201cThe Unknown University,\u201d an omnibus of Bola\u00f1o\u2019s poetry that weighs in at a whopping 766 pages, in whose pages an eager reader can gorge on the late Chilean\u2019s idiosyncratic verse, charting its transition from avant-garde to nearly essayistic, until their vision fails. Or perhaps the fatigue can be traced to the simple fact that many of the biographical lacunae that made reading and writing about Bola\u00f1o so exciting have been filled in, rectified, leaving a man standing in a temple built to an idea.\n\nWhatever the cause, the last year has seen a marked reduction in sweeping, melancholic investigations into Roberto Bola\u00f1o\u2019s interior life. For years, the legend of Bola\u00f1o\u2014born in Chile, raised in Mexico, imprisoned by Pinochet\u2019s regime, released into a new life in Spain, dead at 50 from liver failure\u2014has been a reliably engaging narrative, drawing in new readers from corners normally unreached by literary fiction. The majority of his English-speaking readers discovered Bola\u00f1o after his death in 2003, creating an insatiable hunger for details about his mystery-shrouded personal life. As often happens, this vacuum birthed a plethora of romantic myths: Bola\u00f1o as addict, as profligate Latin lover, as pauper, as liar. Substantial articles appeared in nearly every magazine and website with even a passing interest in arts and culture, generating a canon written by fans trying desperately to understand the few certain facts about their favorite writer (full disclosure: I have also contributed to this body of work).\n\nOften, when parsing some supposition-based treatise on Bola\u00f1o\u2019s lived experiences, or one of the many articles written about the seeming impossibility of determining who he really was, I have wondered if our hunger for information about the author\u2019s private life is fundamentally American, a reiteration of the gauche hunger for illicit secrets engendered by our tabloid culture. Monica Maristain\u2019s \u201cBola\u00f1o: A Biography in Conversations,\u201d out Sept. 30 from Melville House, exposes the innocence of that assumption; the often-mawkish, possessive curiosity of Bola\u00f1o fans, it turns out, is global. Maristain, an Argentine journalist who lives and works in Mexico, has built a career on an interview she did with Bola\u00f1o that incidentally turned out to be the final such conversation he completed before his death. This text is now marketed as \u201cThe Last Interview,\u201d an unfortunate designation; Maristain\u2019s desperately quirky questions (\u201cHave you seen the most beautiful woman in the world?\u201d) read like rejects from Vanity Fair\u2019s musty Proust Questionnaire and offer little about Bola\u00f1o, other than a reiteration of his generally game and genial personality. The interview\u2019s accidental historic import catapulted Maristain into the position of Bola\u00f1o expert, earning her a seat on a panel discussion held at the Los Angeles Public Library last year and, presumably, paving the way for \u201cBola\u00f1o: A Biography in Conversations\u201d (first published in Spanish in 2012 as \u201cEl Hijo de Mister Playa\u201d).\n\n\u201cBola\u00f1o\u201d is an odd book, not exactly what I would call a biography; driven not by researched fact but the author\u2019s outsized preoccupation with its subject, its closest cousin is film critic David Thomson\u2019s 2006 \u201cNicole Kidman,\u201d a fever dream at the height of which Thomson shares his fantasy of encountering Kidman in a Paris cathouse, clad in \u201ca very revealing white brassiere, a size or two too small.\u201d Would that Maristain were as deliciously unhinged.\n\nInstead, she writes defensively, constantly attempting to define her authority and justify her book\u2019s existence. In the first pages, she presents a hopelessly skewed and saccharine account of the email correspondence she shared with Bola\u00f1o as they arranged the interview, an exchange she elevates to romantic encounter: \u201cHe wasn\u2019t shy in our correspondence: Please keep writing, he asked. [\u2026] He always ended conversations with an irresistibly sweet phrase.\u201d This brief contact, Maristain explains, inspired her to \u201cmake some attempt to bring him back, to let those who knew him best have their say.\u201d Indeed, Melville\u2019s publicity materials for the book promise \u201crich interviews with the people who knew Bola\u00f1o best,\u201d and \u201cnew light on aspects of Bola\u00f1o\u2019s life [including] the details of Bola\u00f1o\u2019s fatal illness and the drama of his final days.\u201d\n\nHere is who is not interviewed in Maristain\u2019s book: Carolina L\u00f3pez, the author\u2019s widow, to whom he was married for nearly 30 years, or Lautaro and Alexandra Bola\u00f1o, his children (although, in a sleight-of-hand she pulls often, Maristain includes some brief remarks from Lautaro that her endnotes reveal are actually lifted from his brief appearance in a documentary). It\u2019s evident that Bola\u00f1o\u2019s most intimate circle did not wish to be involved in the book; quotations from his mother, Victoria \u00c1valos, and sister, Mar\u00eda Salom\u00e9, are also sourced from elsewhere. Who, then, does Maristain contend \u201cknew him best\u201d? A cadre of friends, colleagues and admirers, largely from Bola\u00f1o\u2019s early days, as well as Bola\u00f1o\u2019s father Le\u00f3n, from whom he spent a significant portion of his life estranged.\n\nSeveral of the Spanish literati interviewed in the book\u2019s latter half hint at a falling-out with L\u00f3pez that all involved are of course too civilized to describe, but miniature character assassinations on L\u00f3pez are offered throughout, with Maristain\u2019s eager prodding. Although the reasons for the divide between L\u00f3pez and prominent figures such as Jorge Herralde and Ignacio Echevarr\u00eda are murky, the book\u2019s obvious slant\u2014and Maristain\u2019s clear partisanship\u2014makes \u201cBola\u00f1o\u201d almost useless as a resource about the author\u2019s life.", "article_metadata": {"description": "This book offers so much speculation posing as fact that it starts to seem like something darker: a revenge project", "title": "Don\u2019t be duped by \u201cBola\u00f1o\u201d: The dangers of the unauthorized biography", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "This book offers so much speculation posing as fact that it starts to seem like something darker: a revenge project", "title": "Don\u2019t be duped by \u201cBola\u00f1o\u201d: The dangers of the unauthorized biography", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/10/04/dont_be_duped_by_bolano_the_dangers_of_the_unauthorized_biography/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/09/roberto_bolano.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "This book offers so much speculation posing as fact that it starts to seem like something darker: a revenge project", "title": "Don\u2019t be duped by \u201cBola\u00f1o\u201d: The dangers of the unauthorized biography", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/09/roberto_bolano.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Lisa Locascio", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Biography, Books, Editor's Picks, Roberto Bola\u00f1o", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd89be\"", "article_summary": "Topics: Biography, Books, Editor's Picks, Roberto Bola\u00f1o, Media News, Entertainment NewsAfter a half-decade in which all things Roberto Bola\u00f1o were ravenously consumed, Anglophone readers seem to have finally hit Peak Bola\u00f1o.\nMonica Maristain\u2019s \u201cBola\u00f1o: A Biography in Conversations,\u201d out Sept. 30 from Melville House, exposes the innocence of that assumption; the often-mawkish, possessive curiosity of Bola\u00f1o fans, it turns out, is global.\nDid the hammer come down in late 2012, when Sam Carter complained of a \u201cBola\u00f1o Bubble\u201d in The New Republic?\nWhatever the cause, the last year has seen a marked reduction in sweeping, melancholic investigations into Roberto Bola\u00f1o\u2019s interior life.\nAs often happens, this vacuum birthed a plethora of romantic myths: Bola\u00f1o as addict, as profligate Latin lover, as pauper, as liar."}
