(Just click on the \u201cSee Plans Now\u201d button on the homepage and follow instructions.) But here\u2019s the problem: The monthly premium estimates provided on the website do not consider a person\u2019s specific age, household size or tobacco use \u2013 all critical factors when estimating premiums.\n\nHealthCare.gov visitors using the site\u2019s window-shopping tool are repeatedly told that \u201cthe final premium you pay may be lower, perhaps much lower, than the prices shown\u201d once they fill out an application and apply for government subsidies. But what the site doesn\u2019t say is that the actual premium may be higher, perhaps much higher, than the estimated premiums shown on the site.\n\nWe knew estimates would vary from the actual premiums once customers create an account, provide personal information and obtain accurate price quotes. HealthCare.gov discloses that on the page titled \u201cHow can I see Marketplace health plans and prices before I fill out an application?\u201d\n\nBut we didn\u2019t know how useless the website\u2019s window-shopper tool can be for certain consumers \u2013 a fact brought to our attention by ValuePenguin.com, a consumer finance website that provides its own comparison shopping tool for marketplace health plans. (Ezekiel J. Emanuel, a former White House adviser who helped design the Affordable Care Act, cites ValuePenguin.com and other alternatives to HealthCare.gov in a Nov. 15 article he coauthored on Politico called \u201cWho Needs HealthCare.gov?\u201d)\n\nWe decided to do a little comparison shopping of our own, based on the personal circumstances of two FactCheck.org staffers. (Important note: Nobody at FactCheck.org needs to shop on the individual market because, like most Americans, we get coverage through our employer \u2014 which in our case is the University of Pennsylvania.)\n\nFirst example: 54-year-old man shopping for a health plan that would cover him, his 55-year-old wife and two dependent children (ages 14 and 21). The family lives in suburban Philadelphia. None is a smoker.\n\nWe first compared the estimated monthly premiums provided by HealthCare.gov with the estimates provided by ValuePenguin.com, and then went to the insurance company websites for actual price quotes.\n\nFor our family of four, HealthCare.gov offers six Silver plans: four Independence Blue Cross plans and two Aetna plans. (We considered only the Silver plans to keep it simple.) The HealthCare.gov estimates ranged from $708.84 per month to $982 per month.\n\nNow, HealthCare.gov doesn\u2019t ask for ages or even an age range when providing plan information and premium estimates for family coverage. All it wants to know is the visitor\u2019s home state and county.\n\nValuePenguin.com asks for a little more information. Besides county and state, window shoppers have to provide household size, as well as ages and tobacco use for all family members. That website\u2019s estimates were higher \u2014 much higher. A whopping 69 percent higher for each exchange plan. The premium range: $1,201.44 to $1,666 per month. (And, remember, that\u2019s for a family of nonsmokers.)\n\nWe then went to Independence Blue Cross and Aetna websites to get actual quotes using their marketplace browsing features. Both websites asked for the same information as ValuePenguin.com \u2014 except that the insurance companies wanted birth dates, not just ages. We found, not surprisingly, that the insurers\u2019 price quotes were almost exactly the same as the estimates provided by ValuePenguin.com. In fact, they were exactly correct in three of the four Blue Cross plans. ValuePenguin.com\u2019s estimates were slightly off \u2014 lower by no more than 4 .5 percent \u2014 for the two Aetna plans.\n\nWhy was the HealthCare.gov website so far off the mark? The website discloses up front, while you are browsing for plans and prices, that the premium estimates are \u201cbased on a limited set of sample ages.\u201d But potential customers would have to dig deeper into the website to find out what sample ages the tool uses. (Go to the homepage, scroll to the bottom until you see \u201cQuick Information,\u201d and click on \u201cHealth Plans\u201d under the header \u201cPlan Information for Individuals and Families.\u201d)\n\nIn the case of a family of four, the website assumes that the husband and wife are both 30 years old. In our real life example, they are 55 and 54. That\u2019s important because the Affordable Care Act says insurance companies can charge older Americans up to three times more than younger ones.\n\nOf course, the closer a couple is to 30 years old, the better the estimate will be. And that brings us to our second example: a 29-year-old single man living in the city of Philadelphia.\n\nIn the case of single adults, HealthCare.gov asks one additional question that it does not ask of those seeking family coverage. It asks for an age range (\u201c49 or under\u201d or \u201c50 or over\u201d). It informs visitors at this point that \u201c[p]remium amounts in this tool are based on specific ages,\u201d but again you have to dig deeper to find that the specific ages are 27 for someone who selects \u201c49 or under\u201d and 50 for someone who selects \u201c50 or over.\u201d\n\nIn our second example, the 29-year-old man is close enough to age 27 that HealthCare.gov provided better estimates \u2014 but they were still too low. For six Silver plans, HealthCare.gov provided cost estimates that ranged from $209.85 to $291, while the insurance companies provided quotes ranging from $224.07 to $322. HealthCare.gov underestimated the actual cost of the Blue Cross plans by 7 percent and the Aetna plans by no more than 12 percent. (ValuePenguin.com provided a range of $224.07 to $310.71, which again was more accurate than the exchange.)\n\nYes, we know that HealthCare.gov tells visitors that these are merely estimates and actual prices may vary. At one point in the process, this caveat is provided:\n\nImportant note: The monthly premiums shown DO NOT take into account your income and household details. Premium amounts shown in this tool are only examples, based on a limited set of sample ages and scenarios. They may not fully reflect your individual situation. Actual plan pricing can change based on your household size, income, ages, and tobacco use.\n\nAt no point during the process of browsing for plans and prices are visitors informed that they may pay more \u2014 in some cases much more \u2014 for insurance than the estimated prices shown on the site. But the site repeatedly tells visitors that the actual prices may be lower. Every page during the process of surfing for plans and prices carries a blue box that says:\n\nIMPORTANT NOTE: The prices shown on this tool don\u2019t reflect the lower costs you may qualify for based on household size and income. Most people who apply will pay lower monthly premiums than those shown here. Households with yearly incomes up to about $46,000 for individuals or $94,000 for a family of 4 will qualify for lower costs. You\u2019ll get final quotes for specific plans based on your income and household after you complete a Marketplace application.\n\nOn one page \u2014 just before you see the plans and cost estimates \u2014 you are told twice about the possibility of lower costs. On that page, you get the \u201cimportant note\u201d above, plus this:\n\nMost people who apply will qualify for lower costs. Most people who apply for coverage in the Marketplace will qualify for lower costs on monthly premiums based on their household size and income. The chart on the right shows household sizes and income levels that qualify for lower costs. The lower your income within the ranges shown, the lower your premium costs will be. Some people with lower incomes within these ranges will qualify to save money on out-of-pocket costs like deductibles and copayments.\n\nIt is true that many people seeking insurance on the individual market will receive government subsidies that will help offset the cost of insurance premiums. In an Aug. 14 report, the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation estimates that \u201cabout half (48%) of people now buying their own insurance would be eligible for a tax credit that would offset their premium.\u201d In addition, more than 1 million people now buying their own insurance will be eligible for Medicaid, the report says.\n\n\u201cAmong the approximately half of current enrollees who will be eligible for tax credits, the average subsidy would be $5,548 per family, which would reduce their premium for the second-lowest-cost silver premium by an average of 66%,\u201d the KFF report says.\n\nThose estimates don\u2019t include people who are not currently part of the individual market but will buy coverage on the state and federal exchanges. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates that altogether about 80 percent of the 25 million Americans with insurance exchange plans in 2023 will receive subsidies.\n\nSo, it is important for HealthCare.gov to inform them that they may be eligible for a subsidy that could lower their costs.\n\nBut, by failing to disclose the fact that actual premiums may be far more than the estimates provided on its site, HealthCare.gov has the potential to mislead those same families as well as others who won\u2019t be eligible for subsidies at all.\n\nUpdate, Dec. 2: The so-called window shopping feature on HealthCare.gov has been improved and, as a result, so has the accuracy of the site\u2019s estimated monthly premiums. The site now asks visitors to provide specific ages for each household member when estimating the cost of premiums. It still does not, however, ask about tobacco use. See our Dec. 2 item \u201cHealthCare.Gov Improves Estimates\u201d for more details.\n\n\u2014 Eugene Kiely, with D\u2019Angelo Gore and Lori Robertson", "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "The HealthCare.gov estimates ranged from $708.84 per month to $982 per month.\nNow, HealthCare.gov doesn\u2019t ask for ages or even an age range when providing plan information and premium estimates for family coverage.\nFor six Silver plans, HealthCare.gov provided cost estimates that ranged from $209.85 to $291, while the insurance companies provided quotes ranging from $224.07 to $322.\nYes, we know that HealthCare.gov tells visitors that these are merely estimates and actual prices may vary.\nBrowsers beware: The estimated monthly premiums on HealthCare.gov may be misleading."}
