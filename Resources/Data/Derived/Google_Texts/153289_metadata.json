It started with police knocking on their doors and telling them to get out, they said. And they received a text from campus officials.\n\nUp to 75 students huddled in knots of half a dozen or more, sitting on grass or pavement, chatting and watching from half a block away as a few dozen uniformed men milled around emergency vehicles outside their blockaded building.\n\nAs Saturday afternoon dragged into evening, the stranded students complained about being simultaneously scared, bored and hungry \u2014 as well as concerned about lab reports not getting written and test materials not studied.\n\nThey watched and exclaimed as police escorted one student into the building.\n\n\u201cI spend a lot of money to go here, and I would have liked to have been a little better informed through this,\u201d said 19-year-old Jacob Massey.\n\nIt was \u201cvery annoying\u201d to lose all this time without much explanation, said 18-year-old Chanler Kelly.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Denver Police evacuate apartment building due to suspicious device", "title": "Denver Police evacuate apartment building due to suspicious device", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/04/11/denver-police-evacuate-apartment-building-due-to-suspicious-device/", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150411_044318_twitter.com-CCWES5HWEAE9wdN-1.jpg", "height": 450}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150411_044318_twitter.com-CCWES5HWEAE9wdN-1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-04-11T16:56:14+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-24T20:02:26+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Denver police gave the all clear just before 7 p.m for an apartment building near the Auraria Campus that was evacuated for 3\u00bd hours Saturday afternoon after a report of a suspicious device.\nPolice spokesman Sonny Jackson said roommates of a student had observed and reported a suspicious item about 3:30 p.m., but ultimately Denver fire and police technicians determined it was not an explosive or hazardous device.\nPolice Technician Eranda Piyasena said officials couldn\u2019t provide any information about what the device actually was.\nUniversity of Colorado Denver and Metropolitan State University students living at the complex were shut out of their residences, and without access to their cars, for 3\u00bd hours.\nIt was \u201cvery annoying\u201d to lose all this time without much explanation, said 18-year-old Chanler Kelly."}
