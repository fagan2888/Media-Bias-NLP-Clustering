Rand Paul (R-Ky.), an early adopter of the social network among presidential hopefuls thinks it is a winning strategy.\n\nPaul joined Snapchat in January 2014 and did an interview with CNN over the social media network earlier this year.\n\nThough commonly associated with sexting, Snapchat, which deletes photos and videos after viewing, also provides a perfect vehicle for Paul\u2019s message on privacy and NSA spying.\n\n\u201cWe reach thousands of kids that we might not ever have reached before,\u201d Paul told Politico\u2019s Mike Allen recently, as quoted by the Washington Post.\n\n\u201cBut \u2026 you have to have something to say to them too, and we tell them \u2026 that the government has no business looking at their phone records, and I think they appreciate that. I remember being a kid, and you\u2019re trying to escape from under the thumb of your parents. And then you don\u2019t want to replace your parents with the government. I think kids are quite open to the message of having a right to privacy.\u201d\n\nPeople born in 1998 will be eligible to vote in 2016 and Snapchat definitely reaches that demographic.\n\nMore than 60 percent of Snapchat users are between the ages of 18-24, according to a BI Intelligence report.\n\nIt\u2019s also an easy way to reach a large number of young voters. Snapchat announced in May that it had 200 million users who send about 700 million photos a day, WaPo reported.\n\nBut while Paul might have the GOP market on Snapchat cornered for now, Democratic 2016 hopefuls are starting to edge in on the millennial battleground.\n\nHillary Clinton starred in a Snapchat story to commemorate International Women\u2019s Day just last weekend, and according to the Washington Post, former Maryland governor Martin O\u2019Malley joined the social network recently as well.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "NGFB Pro 7.8.4U", "og": {"site_name": "Red Alert Politics", "description": "Rand Paul conducts an interview with CNN via Snapchat (Image via Screenshot) The 2016 election may be decided by 10-second disappearing photos and selfies.
