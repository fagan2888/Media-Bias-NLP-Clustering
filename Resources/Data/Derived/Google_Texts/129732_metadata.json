Then I went to Prosper, the second-largest lender in the industry. Prosper found investors in my loan in two days and I had my money in five.\n\nI never visited a branch or met a loan officer. And the interest rate of less than 9 percent beat the 13 percent offered by my brick-and-mortar bank.\n\nAfter borrowing the money, I wanted to know more. Who were these \u201cpeers,\u201d and why did they think I was such a good credit risk?\n\nThe answer took me deep into an industry that has already attracted some of the biggest names on Wall Street, like BlackRock and Goldman Sachs, but remains below the radar of most federal regulators. Peer-to-peer lending is still untested by recession, and analysts say it can carry big risks for investors. Consumers, largely unfamiliar with the industry, could face interest rates that exceed those of even the most expensive credit cards.\n\nThe name \u201cpeer-to-peer lending\u201d is somewhat misleading. While individuals do lend money, most of the funding for loans comes from hedge funds, insurance and investment companies, and wealth advisers. It took me three months to find one of the \u201cpeers\u201d who had invested in my loan.\n\nProsper, like the rest of the industry, is seeing exponential growth. The San Francisco-based service created $600 million worth of loans over the first three months of this year, more than triple what it did a year earlier, and it\u2019s hiring as many as 10 loan officers and other employees a week, says CEO Aaron Vermut.\n\nProsper competes with Lending Club, which went public in December, and has reported a 100-plus percent jump in the amount of money it lends year over year. Both companies expect their loan growth to double or triple in the foreseeable future.\n\nProsper and Lending Club are just two of dozens of companies trying to compete. Some, such as Upstart, specialize in loans for young borrowers with limited credit history. Others, such as OnDeck, which went public last year, focus on loans to small businesses.\n\nPeer-to-peers have been able to charge less than traditional banks largely because their costs are low. Prosper, Lending Club and others have no retail branches, and the risk is passed on to investors. As more investors put money into these loans, interest rates have fallen as well. Prosper loans in 2013 had an average rate of 16.8 percent. In 2015, the rate is 13.3 percent.\n\nEven with this growth, peer-to-peer lending is tiny compared with lending by big banks. JPMorgan, for example, has $187 billion in consumer loans on its balance sheet.\n\nThe lending peer I tracked down is Don Davis. I owe him $1,500. Davis\u2019 company, Prime Meridian Capital Management, owns 10 percent of my loan.\n\n\u201cI take you at your word you\u2019ll pay us back,\u201d Davis joked in an interview.\n\nDavis got into peer-to-peer lending in 2012 and owns more than 14,000 loans, in whole or in pieces. His $60 million-plus Prime Meridian Income Fund had a return of 8.5 percent in 2014.\n\nLike many investors, Davis was attracted to peer-to-peer lending because other types of debt, such as bonds, had become unattractive. With interest rates and yields stubbornly low, it\u2019s difficult to make much money in that market.\n\nHow does my 9 percent rate compare? Junk bonds, a risky type of debt, offer a yield of slightly more than 6 percent. Bonds from high-rated companies yield around 2 percent. And some of the safest types of debt, three- and five-year U.S. Treasury notes, yield 0.93 percent and 1.50 percent, respectively.\n\nPeer-to-peer lenders charge from 6 percent for highly qualified borrowers to more than 30 percent for extremely risky applicants.\n\n\u201cI see personal loans as being simple and transparent. That\u2019s why I like them,\u201d Davis said. \u201cWe looked at a lot of different investments that gave us the yield we were looking for, but many of them behind the scenes were overly complex and higher-risk.\u201d\n\nAs demand grows, federal regulation has been slow to keep up with the industry. The Federal Reserve, the banking industry\u2019s main regulator, has issued no rules on how the peer-to-peer industry should operate. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has been silent. Only the Securities and Exchange Commission has weighed in.\n\nIn 2010, the agency ruled that offering peer-to-peer loans to investors amounted to selling securities and said Prosper and Lending Club had to be registered with regulators and provide disclosures to investors about where their money was going.\n\nBut the SEC\u2019s job is to be a regulator for investors, not consumers.\n\nConsumers are largely protected for the moment. Because companies such as Prosper and Lending Club use a third-party bank \u2014 often it\u2019s Utah-based WebBank \u2014 to process the loan, the loan is protected under the Truth in Lending Act and other consumer laws.\n\nHowever, the industry remains untested. The loans have not been through an economic downturn, so there\u2019s no data on how many borrowers could default in a recession. And because the loans are unsecured, the only recourse for investors if borrowers fail to repay them is debt collectors.\n\nEven industry executives acknowledge that the runaway growth could backfire. For instance, while Prosper has seen substantial growth, the platform is not consistently profitable.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s frothiness in the industry right now,\u201d says Prosper\u2019s Vermut, \u201cand when the environment changes, we will find out who\u2019s really running a good business.\u201d\n\nKen Sweet covers banking and consumer finance issues for The Associated Press.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Why I skipped the bank and took out a loan from my \u2018peers\u2019", "og": {"description": "Why I skipped the bank and took out a loan from my \u2018peers\u2019", "title": "Borrowing without the bank", "url": "http://www.dallasnews.com/business/personal-finance/headlines/20150517-borrowing-without-the-bank.ece", "image": {"width": 1280, "identifier": "http://www.dallasnews.com/business/personal-finance/headlines/20150517-bankless_borrowing_43889415.jpg.ece/BINARY/original/BANKLESS_BORROWING_43889415.JPG", "height": 853}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "type": "article"}, "LastModifiedDate": "2015-05-18T01:26:58Z", "twitter": {"site": "@dallasnews", "card": "summary", "creator": "@dallasnews"}, "PublishDate": "2015-05-18T01:24:36Z", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Borrowing without the bank\", \"link\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/business/personal-finance/headlines/20150517-borrowing-without-the-bank.ece\", \"image_url\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/business/personal-finance/headlines/20150517-bankless_borrowing_43889415.jpg.ece/BINARY/original/BANKLESS_BORROWING_43889415.JPG\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"2299109\", \"pub_date\": \"2015-05-18T01:24:36Z\", \"section\": \"Economy & You Headlines\", \"author\": \"\", \"tags\": [\"dallas\", \"dallas fort worth\", \"dallas news\", \"dallas fort worth news\", \"dfw news\", \"dallas local news\", \"dallas fort worth local news\", \"dallas newspaper\", \"dallas morning news\", \"dallas morning news newspaper\"]}", "fb": {"admins": 1043783589, "page_id": 20946638799, "app_id": 258290334265148}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"image": "http://www.dallasnews.com/business/personal-finance/headlines/20150517-bankless_borrowing_43889415.jpg.ece/ALTERNATES/w660/BANKLESS_BORROWING_43889415.JPG", "publishtime": "2015-05-18T01:24:36Z"}}, "news_keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper"}, "article_summary": "And the interest rate of less than 9 percent beat the 13 percent offered by my brick-and-mortar bank.\nI visited my local bank and asked for a $15,000 loan but was offered an interest rate higher than my cards were charging.\nThe Federal Reserve, the banking industry\u2019s main regulator, has issued no rules on how the peer-to-peer industry should operate.\nEven with this growth, peer-to-peer lending is tiny compared with lending by big banks.\nThe first company I went to, Upstart, was willing to lend me money, but, again, the interest rate was too high."}
