Castle Rock police have called off a search for a mother and her two children Saturday night.

According to a news release by the department, after the woman saw news reports, she called police and “voluntarily brought them to the Castle Rock Police Department to verify their welfare.”

KerriAnne Mukhopadhyay, a spokeswoman for the town of Castle Rock, said the children are still with their mother.

Although police are investigating the woman, Monisha Bush, 30, for complaints of child abuse, she is not currently being detained, Mukhopadhyay said.

Police had said in an earlier news release that the children, a 5-year-old daughter and 2-year-old son, were last seen with their mother on Thursday, outside their daycare provider.

Police feared the children may be in danger as they are investigating a child abuse complaint. They did not specify the nature of the complaint or why they thought the children were endangered.
