A man told police he was riding his bicycle when a man attacked him with a butcher knife, cutting him twice on his right hand early Saturday morning.

It happened just before 4 a.m. near the Fabric Care Center in the 2900 block of East Harry.

Police said the victim walked himself to the hospital where he was treated for the minor injuries. The suspect is described as a male, about 6-feet tall, and wearing a dark blue hooded sweatshirt.

No money or property was reported taken from the victim. Police said it was unclear whether the two men knew each other or if this attack was the result of an attempted robbery.
