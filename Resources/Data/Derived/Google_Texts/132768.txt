Fort Walton Beach, FL---A former Viking is now set to be a Titan.

Former Fort Walton Beach star (class of 2011) Deiontrez Mount was selected Saturday as the first pick in the sixth round of the 2015 NFL Draft (177th overall) by Tennessee.

Spending his past four years in Louisville, Mount capped off his college career playing in 13 games, registering 37 tackles, 10.5 for a loss, and five sacks in his senior season.

The 6'5" 243 pound defensive end is now beginning his pro career in Nashville as one of 10 Cardinals selected in the three days of the Draft. That mark is second best of all schools, only trailing Florida State, who had 11 Seminoles selected by the pros.
