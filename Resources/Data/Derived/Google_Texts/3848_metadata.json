This extension will apply regardless of age, effecting more than 4,500 members of staff who are under the age of 25. The current base pay for Baristas is \u00a36.77 per hour. Supervisor pay will move from \u00a38.20 to \u00a38.72 per hour. Starbucks says it is supportive of the government\u2019s longer-term ambition to raise base pay to \u00a39.00 per hour.\n\nShelter\u2019s Tenancy Deposit Loan Scheme is part of the charity\u2019s Home Sweet Loan program in partnership with Generation Rent. Upon its implementation, Starbucks will provide interest-free loans to help its employees \u2013 or \u201cpartners,\u201d as they\u2019re called at the company \u2014 pay rental deposits when they are moving into a new home.\n\n\n\nStarbucks'\n\nColleen Chapman\n\nwill discuss\n\nBusiness Model\n\nTransformation\n\nInside a Company\n\nat SB '15 London\n\n\u201cWe know the cost of living is a key concern for many, with the average rental deposit in England now is \u00a31,226. And with over half of our partners being under 25 years old, that rent affordability especially is an issue that affects them. These initiatives are two of the ways we are able to support the great people that work with us,\" said Kris Engskov, president of Starbucks EMEA.\n\nRobb added, \u201cAfter successfully launching the programme with our own staff in 2013, it\u2019s great to see that Starbucks is following suit and helping their staff to move into a home without worrying about how they\u2019ll cover the cost. This will no doubt encourage other UK employers to follow their example and give renters the helping hand they need.\u201d\n\nStarbucks\u2019 efforts to take care of its employees extend to the States, where in 2013 CEO Howard Shultz pledged that the company would not cut hours or benefits for partners in response to Obamacare when many other large companies in the food service sector said they would need to shift applicable costs onto their workers; and last year, the coffee giant launched the Starbucks College Achievement Plan \u2014 an opportunity for eligible part-time and full-time employees to complete a Bachelor\u2019s degree with full tuition reimbursement through a collaboration with Arizona State University's online degree program.\n\nLuckily, Starbucks isn\u2019t alone in proactively setting a new bar for compensation for workers in the retail and food sectors: In 2014, IKEA announced would raise its average minimum wage in its US stores to $10.76 \u2014 a 17 percent increase over the current wage, and $3.51 above the current federal minimum wage \u2014 and earlier this year, IKEA UK followed suit by becoming the first UK retailer to pay workers above the new National Living Wage. And in July, Chipotle Mexican Grill expanded benefits formerly reserved for salaried employees to all workers, including full tuition reimbursements, sick pay, and paid vacations.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.sustainablebrands.com/news_and_views/organizational_change/hannah_furlong/starbucks_uk_give_home_sweet_loans_employees_und", "site_name": "sustainablebrands.com", "image": "http://www.sustainablebrands.com/sites/default/files/article_images/barista.jpg", "type": "website", "description": "Starbucks UK is going beyond government recommendations for the National Living Wage and will be the first private company to implement housing and homelessness charity Shelter\u2019s Tenancy Deposit Loan Scheme, to help its employees manage the cost of living.
