Fresh off his intimate SXSW show with Kanye West, Jay Z has teamed up with Jay Electronica for a new remix of Soulja Boy's "We Made It." The release marks the first collaboration between the two since "Shiny Suit Theory" in 2010, the same year Jay Z signed Electronica to his Roc Nation label.

This is the third track from Jay Electronica in the past month, but the New Orleans rapper is still intent on making up for lost time: "Apologies go out to all of my fans 'cause they waited so patiently/ this one is for all of the lost and forgotten black angels that prayed for me," he says, before deftly shifting pace and spinning rapid-fire references to the Sphinx and the pyramids, Obamacare and the Middle Passage.

Drake remixed the same track back in December, using the same soundbites from Eastbound and Down. Jay Z's verse includes a nod to that last version, along with a response to Drake's complaint in a recent Rolling Stone story that "Hov can’t drop bars these days without at least four art references." "Sorry Mr. Drizzy for so much art talk," he says, "silly me rappin’ about shit that I really bought/ while these rappers rap about guns they ain't shot/and a bunch of other silly shit that they ain't got." He seals the deal with what must be the first rhymed reference to Oscar-winning 12 Years a Slave star Lupita Nyong'o in a recorded track.
