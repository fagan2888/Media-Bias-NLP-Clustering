In light of these challenges, however, they've displayed remarkable courage and resilience,\" said Colonel Brian Tribus.\n\nInterviews with Afghan officials and witnesses in Kunduz showed the swiftness with which the city fell.\n\nThe first attacks hit at least eight police checkpoints forming a perimeter around the city center.\n\nSome questioned why Afghan National Police, and not better-armed army units or even special forces, were protecting the center of a city, especially given the Taliban had threatened to take it earlier this year.\n\n\"None of this should have come as a surprise to the security forces,\" said Omar Hamid, head of Asia analysis for IHS Country Risk security analysts.\n\n\"Under any normal tactical thinking, the Afghan forces would have put more seasoned troops in those positions.\"\n\nOthers noted that Kunduz officials had been asking for reinforcements for months.\n\n\"They asked for more troops but unfortunately did not get them,\" said Ghulam Bahawuddin Jilani, an Afghan politician.\n\nTALIBAN LEARN FROM MISTAKES?\n\nOn Monday morning, Kunduz had about 2,000 national police and 3,000 soldiers protecting the city, backed by about 1,000 militiamen linked to local power brokers, Kunduz police spokesman Sayed Sarwar Hussaini said.\n\nIf the battle for Kunduz exposed Afghan government forces' weaknesses, it also proved a public relations coup for the Taliban's tactical and strategic prowess.\n\nU.S. and Afghan officials have this year sought to portray the Taliban as unable to take and hold major territory and weakened by confirmation of the death of the movement's founder, Mullah Mohammad Omar.\n\nThe swift and well-planned assault on Kunduz, a city of 300,000, was intended to show the Taliban's new leader, Mullah Akhtar Mansour, is able to win in battle, a spokesman said.\n\n\"This is a message to those saying the Taliban had divided or weakened after Mullah Omar's death,\" Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said.\n\nHe added that fighters who stormed Kunduz were under instruction to treat civilians well, admitting the movement had made mistakes in the past, including alienating the public with its brutal interpretation of Islamic law.\n\n\"There is a separate section within the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan that will start its peaceful work later to invite people towards religion,\" Mujahid said, using the formal term used to describe the Taliban.\n\n\"They will not use any force or violence to force people into following sharia (Islamic law). We have learnt lessons from the past and will not repeat mistakes.\"\n\nWhether the Taliban can hold Kunduz remains to be seen. Government reinforcements have been stalled by Taliban disruptions to supply routes, but may arrive overnight.\n\n\"I have no doubt the Afghan forces will retake Kunduz eventually,\" said IHS's Hamid. \"But the damage to the reputation of Afghan forces is already done.\"\n\n(Additional reporting by Jessica Donati in Kabul and Jibran Ahmed in Peshawar, Pakistan.
