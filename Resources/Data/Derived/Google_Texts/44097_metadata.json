(AP) \u2014 The owner of the home where Rosie O\u2019Donnell\u2019s missing teen daughter was found earlier this week has been arrested for allegedly having inappropriate online communications with the 17-year-old girl, according to authorities and the star\u2019s spokeswoman.\n\nSteven Sheerer faces charges of child endangerment and distribution of obscenity to a minor, authorities said Saturday.\n\nThe Ocean County Prosecutor\u2019s Office declined to identify the victim, citing her age. But a spokeswoman for O\u2019Donnell said the case involves the star\u2019s daughter, Chelsea.\n\n\u201cHe was involved with a minor, and Rosie\u2019s concern has been and always will be the health, safety and well-being of her daughter,\u201d Cindi Berger told The Associated Press. \u201cRosie is profoundly appreciative for the work the Ocean County Prosecutor\u2019s Office has done and the diligence of the local police.\u201d\n\nSheerer, 25, was arrested Friday night at his home in Barnegat, police said. Chelsea O\u2019Donnell had been found at the home Tuesday, hours after her mother posted a statement online saying the girl had left home on Aug. 11.\n\nAuthorities have said police went to the home and the person answering the door initially did not want to reveal Chelsea\u2019s presence. Police said they told the occupant they would not leave until she came out; she then appeared and willingly left with police.\n\nSheerer\u2019s arrest came several hours after authorities had obtained the girl\u2019s cellphone with her mother\u2019s consent, prosecutors said. They allegedly found \u201cinappropriate communications\u201d that had occurred over the last several weeks between Sheerer and the minor.\n\nAuthorities seized a computer and other digital equipment at Sheerer\u2019s home when they executed a search warrant, but did not disclose further details.\n\nIt was not known Saturday if Sheerer had retained an attorney and a telephone number for him could not be located. His bail was set at $40,000 cash, and he faces up to 10 years in prison if convicted, authorities said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The owner of the home where Rosie O'Donnell's missing teen daughter was found earlier this week has been arrested for allegedly having inappropriate online communications with the 17-year-old girl, according to authorities and the star's spokeswoman.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "The owner of the home where Rosie O\u2019Donnell\u2019s missing teen daughter was found earlier this week has been arrested for allegedly having inappropriate online communications with the 17-year-old girl, according to authorities and the star\u2019s spokeswoman.", "title": "Steven Sheerer, man found with Rosie O\u2019Donnell\u2019s teen daughter Chelsea, to face charges", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/aug/22/man-faces-obscenity-charge-after-odonnells-daughte/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/08/22/ddaece06abf9d8257f0f6a7067008918.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/08/22/ddaece06abf9d8257f0f6a7067008918.jpg", "description": "The owner of the home where Rosie O'Donnell's missing teen daughter was found earlier this week has been arrested for allegedly having inappropriate online communications with the 17-year-old girl, ac", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Steven Sheerer, man found with Rosie O\u2019Donnell\u2019s teen daug"}, "Author": "Bruce Shipkowski", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Law Crime, Steven Sheerer"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb59e\"", "article_summary": "But a spokeswoman for O\u2019Donnell said the case involves the star\u2019s daughter, Chelsea.\nThe Ocean County Prosecutor\u2019s Office declined to identify the victim, citing her age.\nSteven Sheerer faces charges of child endangerment and distribution of obscenity to a minor, authorities said Saturday.\nIt was not known Saturday if Sheerer had retained an attorney and a telephone number for him could not be located.\nHis bail was set at $40,000 cash, and he faces up to 10 years in prison if convicted, authorities said."}
