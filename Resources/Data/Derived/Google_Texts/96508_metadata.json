Re-homing is \u201cnot right, not fair, not safe.\u201d\n\nAdam Crapser, a Korean-American adoptee who also was re-homed \u2014 in his case, dropped off at a state agency \u2014 faces deportation because none of his parents completed his U.S. naturalization papers.\n\nRe-homing is \u201cdevastating in so many ways,\u201d Mr. Crapser told The Washington Times in an email. \u201cI know I am one of many, and I\u2019m 40 years old now. My life is only to provide a future and life for my children and wife.\u201d\n\nMedia reports have put a spotlight on the legal practice of adoptive parents using personal or Internet networks to transfer custody of their adopted children. At least some of the adoptees\u2019 new homes have turned out to belong to child molesters.\n\nLawmakers in Maine and several other states, as well as in Congress, are moving to stop the practice.\n\nDetails about re-homing are expected to be compiled in a report due this fall from the Government Accountability Office.\n\nIn the case of Mr. Crapser, who was born in 1975, re-homing was just part of the abuse and neglect he experienced as an adoptee.\n\nBorn in South Korea to a Korean mother and a Western father, Mr. Crapser and his elder sister were abandoned to an orphanage by their mother. In 1979, a Korean adoption agency placed them with a Michigan family, with the help of state adoption officials.\n\nThe American family had other children and was very troubled.\n\n\u201cI remember a lot of fighting and yelling,\u201d as well as whippings and the sexual abuse of his sister, Mr. Crapser said. After the family moved to Portland, Oregon, they decided they didn\u2019t want Adam or his sister and relinquished them to an Oregon agency.\n\nMr. Crapser, now separated from his sister, went through several foster families and a group home before being placed with the Crapser family.\n\nBut life got worse: The parents were vindictive and violent in punishing Adam and their other children. Both parents eventually were found guilty of felony criminal mistreatment and child assault. The father also was found guilty of raping a daughter.\n\nWhat no parent or U.S. adoption official ever did was complete Mr. Crapser\u2019s naturalization papers, which caught the eye of immigration officials. They say that because Mr. Crapser is still a South Korean national \u2014 and has a criminal record in the U.S. \u2014 he should be sent back to South Korea, despite having lived in the U.S. for nearly four decades.\n\nMr. Crapser is a victim of re-homing, said Susan Soon-Keum Cox, vice president of policy and external affairs at Holt International Children\u2019s Services in Eugene, Oregon.\n\n\u201cHe was abandoned to the state of Oregon and it was the state of Oregon that put him into the second adoption that was just so horrible,\u201d Ms. Cox said.\n\nRe-homing exposed\n\nA 2013 expose on re-homing by Reuters news agency estimated that 261 children had been advertised as available for families through a now-closed Yahoo bulletin board. Seventy percent of the children were adopted from foreign countries such as Ethiopia and Russia.\n\nThe Reuters series, \u201cThe Child Exchange,\u201d found that parents released their adopted children to relatives or strangers with a simple power-of-attorney document, ignoring the federal Interstate Compact on the Placement of Children, which governs transfer of child custody across state lines, and state prohibitions against child abandonment and child trafficking.\n\nIn Ms. Lemma\u2019s case, she was re-homed without her biological sisters to live with her adoptive mother\u2019s parents.\n\n\u201cChildren matter more than cars,\u201d but it was easier to transfer ownership of a child than buy a car, Ms. Lemma said Thursday to Maine lawmakers who are considering a bill to ban re-homing.\n\nAccording to the Reuters series, re-homed children were sometimes subjected to mistreatment, sexual crimes and abandonment.\n\nIn May, an Arizona couple who talked to Reuters about their re-homing activities were formally charged with kidnapping two minors and transporting one across state lines with intent to engage in sexual activity. That couple \u2014 Nicole and Calvin Eason \u2014 used different identities to take custody of at least six boys and girls from other families, Reuters reported May 8.\n\nStates step up\n\nAt least six states have enacted laws to limit or outlaw re-homing, including Arkansas, where at least 10 cases of re-homing have been identified, a state lawmaker said.\n\nOne Arkansas case involved one of the state\u2019s lawmakers: state Rep. Justin Harris turned to re-homing in 2013 to deal with two sisters he and his wife adopted.\n\nThe Harrises, who have three boys, initially brought three young sisters into their home at their birth mother\u2019s request. At least two of the girls already had been sexually molested, the Arkansas Times reported in March. The Harrises started the formal adoption process in 2012 but soon released one sister to state therapeutic care. They also began keeping one sister apart from the other children in the home for their safety.\n\nWhen Mrs. Harris suffered a health crisis in the fall of 2013, the Harrises essentially re-homed their two adopted girls, sending them to live with a longtime friend of Mrs. Harris whose husband, Eric Cameron Francis, was a teacher in the child care center the Harrises own.\n\nFrancis later was charged with raping the older girl. Now divorced, he has been sentenced to prison, and all three of the girls have been adopted by new families, the Arkansas Times reported.\n\nArkansas\u2019 legislation, signed into law in April by Gov. Asa Hutchinson, forbids adoptive parents from assigning custody of their children to another household without a court order, unless the people are close relatives. Re-homing under other circumstances is a felony punishable by prison and fines.\n\nColorado, Florida, Louisiana, Ohio and Wisconsin also have adopted laws against re-homing, said the National Conference of State Legislatures.\n\nMaine, Maryland, Nebraska, New York and North Carolina lawmakers are considering laws against the practice.\n\nFederal action\n\nNo federal law specifically outlaws re-homing, although the issue is on the radar of some members of Congress.\n\nAn adoption safety bill by Reps. James R. Langevin, Rhode Island Democrat, and Robert J. Wittman, Virginia Republican, would make it illegal to \u201coffer to engage or engaging in the transfer of permanent custody or control of a minor in contravention of a required legal procedure.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Sens. Roy Blunt, Missouri Republican, and Amy Klobuchar, Minnesota Democrat, have sponsored a bill focusing on post-adoption services, which many see as a major part of the solution to distress and disruption in adoptive families.\n\nBoston-area child-welfare advocate Maureen Flatley, who has testified on the issue, said she sees three kinds of people who get caught up in re-homing.\n\nSome are \u201cwonderful families who have done everything they can think of\u201d to care for their adopted children but end up struggling to cope with problems and, after getting no help from agencies or states, turn to re-homing in desperation, Ms. Flatley said.\n\nA second group is adoptive parents who take children into their homes for \u201cthe wrong reasons\u201d and end up looking for some way to offload them.\n\n\u201cAnd then you have the stone-cold predators who get kids to take advantage of them, and take them off the grid and you never see them again,\u201d Ms. Flatley said. \u201cAll three groups are represented in this problem.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Adopted under false pretenses from Ethiopia in 2006, Tarikuwa Lemma was barely acclimated to America when her family \"re-homed\" her to relatives a few months later.
