The process involves using explosives to blast mountain tops, exposing underlying coal deposits, a less-expensive and labor-intensive method than underground mining. The resulting rock and soil debris is dumped into valleys at the foot of mountains.\n\nIn 2010, then-Governor Phil Bredesen petitioned the federal government to ban the practice in certain areas in eastern Tennessee. It is a proposal that has the support of the current administration.\n\n\u201cThis will protect the specific high-elevation ridgelines and conserve the mountains on these public lands in a manner that not only will protect existing natural habitat, but also the viewsheds, vistas and recreation opportunities that support local tourism,\u201d said Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation Commissioner Bob Martineau. \u201cWe welcome the public comment that will come in the next phase of this process.\u201d\n\nA draft proposal by the federal Department of the Interior would end the practice in 67,000 acres in the North Cumberland Wildlife Management Area. The department has set a Jan. 25 deadline to receive public comment about the proposal, which can be seen here.\n\nReach Anita Wadhwani at 615-259-8092 or on Twitter @AnitaWadhwani.\n\nSurface mining public hearings\n\nThe Department of the Interior will hold four public hearings, each beginning at 5:30 pm Eastern Standard Time.\n\nJan. 11: Wartburg Central High School; 1119 Knoxville Hwy.; Wartburg, TN 37887\n\nJan. 12: Roane State Community College; O\u2019Brien Theater; 410 W.H.
