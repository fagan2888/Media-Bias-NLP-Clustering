I’m new at MedCity News, but I’ve been covering health IT a long time; HIMSS15 two weeks ago was my 14th HIMSS conference. For at least the last six years, I’ve been conducting annual interviews with athenahealth CEO Jonathan Bush, either on audio or video.

This time, I had a professional video crew with me, thanks to Dr. Patricia Salber of “The Doctor Weighs In” blog. This is the result, filmed on location at the Hard Rock Café in Chicago before athenahealth’s annual Cloud Party. The party hadn’t started, but beer was flowing, though the gregarious Bush stayed mostly on point, and Mick Jagger made for a nice third wheel.

You got a taste of the interview in an April 17 story that also incorporated comments Bush made to MedCity Editor Chris Seper, but here, for the first time, is the whole thing.

We discussed such things as the CommonWell Health Alliance, federal health IT incentives, value-based purchasing, patient engagement and population health services. Enjoy.
