Photos and videos continue to surface on social media and news outlets depicting crowded, ill-equipped U.S. holding facilities.\n\n\u201cThe situation with the kids is that they came by themselves, they have no relatives here, and the consulates can\u2019t keep up,\u201d a Homeland Security spokesman told CNN. \u201cThey\u2019re in limbo. There\u2019s no one (back home) to deport them to.\u201d\n\n>>> The Smallest Victims of Obama\u2019s Immigration Policy\n\nPresident Obama has called this an \u201curgent humanitarian situation\u201d and is reportedly setting aside $2 million to hire lawyers for the children.\n\nCritics of the situation call it an \u201cadministration-made disaster,\u201d attributing the unprecedented 12-fold spike in underage migrant children to Obama\u2019s controversial Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. Rolled out in 2012, the program allowed many illegal immigrants who came to the U.S. as minors to escape deportation for two years. The White House gave them another two-year window last week.\n\nIn a letter to President Obama last Tuesday, Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer, a Republican, called the operation a \u201ca disturbing example of a deliberate failure to enforce border security policies and repair a broken immigration system.\u201d Brewer, who said the federal government never formally informed her administration of the practice, has demanded answers for the \u201cunwarranted policy of dumping.\u201d In the meantime, the state has made efforts to accommodate the incoming children\u2014ordering medical supplies, providing nutritional meals and supplying pillows and bedding until enough mattresses arrive.\n\n\u201cI am disturbed and outraged that President Obama\u2019s administration continues to implement this dangerous and inhumane policy, meanwhile neglecting to answer crucial questions our citizens demand and deserve,\u201d Brewer said.\n\n>>> Advancing the Immigration Nation: Heritage\u2019s Positive Path to Immigration and Border Security Reform", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Department of Homeland Security is \"dumping\" kids as young as 5 by the busload on Arizona cities because of failed immigration policy.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The Department of Homeland Security is \"dumping\" kids as young as 5 by the busload on Arizona cities because of failed immigration policy.", "title": "Unaccompanied Immigrant Children Fend for Themselves", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/immigthumb.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-06-10T12:29:53+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1uRU5M2"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The Department of Homeland Security is \"dumping\" kids as young as 5 by the busload on Arizona cities because of failed immigration policy.", "creator": "@dailysignal", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/immigthumb.jpg"}, "title": "Unaccompanied Immigrant Children Fend for Themselves", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Society", "tag": "immigration", "published_time": "2014-06-10T12:17:22+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-06-10T12:29:53+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcfd27\"", "article_summary": ">>> Advancing the Immigration Nation: Heritage\u2019s Positive Path to Immigration and Border Security Reform\nCritics of the situation call it an \u201cadministration-made disaster,\u201d attributing the unprecedented 12-fold spike in underage migrant children to Obama\u2019s controversial Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program.\n\u201cThe situation with the kids is that they came by themselves, they have no relatives here, and the consulates can\u2019t keep up,\u201d a Homeland Security spokesman told CNN.\nRolled out in 2012, the program allowed many illegal immigrants who came to the U.S. as minors to escape deportation for two years.\nAccording to CNN, the federal transport of \u201cunaccompanied alien children,\u201d ages 5 to 17, is part of a larger resettlement process, as Homeland Security and Border Patrol facilities in Texas have become \u201coverwhelmed\u201d by the recent influx of illegal immigrants crossing the border from Mexico and Central America."}
