All these years, every day, you\u2019ve been using recreational drugs. Should you tell your kids? Should you admit that on your next job application?\n\nBefore you protest that you have never, ever indulged in any kind of substance abuse, let me point out who\u2019s accusing you. It\u2019s the American Life League, a purportedly Catholic organization that wants you to know the \u201ctruth\u201d about the impact of the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling that Hobby Lobby and similar organizations can refuse to provide coverage for birth control in their employee benefits program.\n\nOn its website and in widely distributed media releases, the League states, \u201cThe birth control pill and its progeny do not treat a medical condition, but rather are promoted as a way for women to avoid pregnancy. Therefore, these pills are not actual medical services but are, in fact, recreational drugs.\u201d\n\nSoooo, those of you who used The Pill anytime since its development in the \u201860s are classified by them as recreational drug users. Of course, the guys who use Viagra are treating \u201ca medical condition\u201d and the cost of their pills is covered by employer-paid and government insurances. When sexually active women try to prevent an unwanted pregnancy, they\u2019re just having fun. And the guys using the little blue pills aren\u2019t?\n\nBy the way, the American Life League\u2019s website will also help you \u201cidentify sex education funding streams and other programs you must fight\u201d in case you also want to prevent schools and social agencies from teaching children anything about what used to be cutely called the \u201cfacts of life.\u201d I wonder if these folks who want to eliminate sex education and limit access to birth control are the same crowd howling with outrage about their tax money being used to assist struggling single moms and neglected children.\n\nNote thousands of women are prescribed contraceptives for dozens of health reasons, such as endometriosis, having nothing to do with birth control. But all that is almost beside the point. The ruling is actually about more than women and sex.\n\nJustice Samuel Alito wrote in the majority opinion that its decision \u201cshould not be understood that an insurance coverage mandate must necessarily fall if it conflicts with an employer\u2019s religious beliefs.\u201d Then he went on to say there are other means by which women can obtain birth control and abortions without violating an employer\u2019s religious freedom. He may be right about that.\n\nBut what about an employer who doesn\u2019t believe in other things? Can he refuse to provide coverage for employees who do believe in them and need them? Parents with unusual but strongly held religious beliefs who refuse to get appropriate medical treatment for their children often have their parental rights taken away by a court. So why is it okay for an employer to say \u201cI don\u2019t believe in this or that, so I won\u2019t help you or your kids get it no matter how serious an issue it is for you.\u201d?\n\nIn a blistering 35-page dissenting opinion Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg asked whether the ruling would extend to employers with religiously grounded objections to blood transfusions (Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses); antidepressants (Scientologists); medications derived from pigs, including anesthesia, intravenous fluids, and pills coated with gelatin (certain Muslims, Jews, and Hindus); and vaccinations.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act was not intended to force any person to do anything that violates their religious beliefs, but when major for-profit corporations claim personhood so they can inflict the owner\u2019s belief on others, that\u2019s just plain wrong.\n\nJustice Ginsburg concluded, \u201cThe Court, I fear, has ventured into a minefield.\u201d\n\nEDITOR\u2019S NOTE: A former state assemblywoman from Jersey City, Joan Quigley is the president and CEO of the North Hudson Community Action Corp. in Union City.
