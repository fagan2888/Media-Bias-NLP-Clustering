This week only, the Student American Dental Hygienist's Association at Gulf Coast is offering free appointments, including exams, cleanings, oral hygiene instruction and any necessary x-rays to children ages 3-12; and this year, the Dental Assisting Program will also provide free sealants on Friday for those who qualify.

Dental Programs Coordinator Laura Justice said, "It has been growing in popularity and the excitement builds. You know, we have patients calling weeks before the events even been advertised, people are starting to expect it each year."

The exams will be available to kids ages 3-12 Monday through Thursday. Last year appointments ran out quickly--so if you want to set up an exam time for your child contact the clinic as soon as you can.
