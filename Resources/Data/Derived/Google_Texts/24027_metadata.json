Bland was found hanging in her jail cell three days later.\n\nThe footage from trooper Brian Encinia\u2019s car initially shows the officer handing Bland a ticket for failing to signal a lane change. The trooper becomes agitated after Bland refuses to put out her cigarette, repeatedly ordering her to get out of the car.\n\n\u201cI refuse to talk to you other than to identify myself,\u201d Bland responded.\n\nThe officer began shouting at her.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to yank you out of here \u2026 I\u2019m going to drag you out,\u201d he yelled as they struggled in the car.\n\nHe then drew his Taser and pointed it at her, yelling, \u201cI will light you up.\u201d\n\nThe Taser was left out of Encinia\u2019s incident report among other details of the altercation, but the report noted that Bland was \u201cargumentative and uncooperative.\u201d\n\nAfter Bland was forced out of the car and placed in handcuffs, she shouted a slew of expletives, screaming off-camera that the officer \u201cslammed\u201d and knocked her head into the ground.\n\n\u201cI got epilepsy,\u201d she said along with an expletive.\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d the officer replied. \u201cGood.\u201d\n\nBland was subsequently charged with assaulting a public servant and taken to Waller County Jail. Encinia stated in his arrest affidavit that Bland was handcuffed for officer safety.\n\n\u201cBland began swinging her elbows at me and then kicked my right leg in the shin. I had a pain in my right leg and suffered small cuts on my right hand,\u201d the report said.\n\nA spokesman for the Texas Department of Public Safety denied Wednesday that the 52-minute video had been doctored despite lapses in the images, blaming \u201ctechnical issues\u201d after receiving criticism on social media.\n\nThree days following the arrest, police said they found Bland, 28, dead in her jail cell from \u201cself-inflicted asphyxiation.\u201d\n\nThe Waller County Sheriff\u2019s Office released surveillance Monday of Bland\u2019s jail cell during the three hours before her death. The video does not show the inside of Bland\u2019s cell, only the hallway leading to the door.\n\nIt shows about a 90-minute period without activity in the hallway. About two hours before she was found dead, the video shows an officer checking in with her and Bland telling him, \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d\n\nThe video then shows an officer peering into the cell, presumably seeing Bland dead and immediately grabbing another officer for help. An EMT rolls a stretcher into her cell, and additional medics are shown moving in. Her body is not shown.\n\n\u201cThe jailer looked through the window and observed Ms. Bland hanging from her privacy partition in her cell,\u201d Capt. Brian Cantrell of the Waller County Sheriff\u2019s Office told reporters. \u201cI\u2019d also like to reiterate that she was found in a semi-standing position with ligatures surrounding her neck. Ms. Bland was then placed on the floor for jailers to perform CPR.\u201d\n\nBland\u2019s death was originally filed as a suicide, but scrutiny from family and friends pushed police to reopen the case.\n\nWaller County District Attorney Elton Mathis told reporters her death \u201cis being treated like a murder investigation.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis team of investigators is committed to conducting a thorough and impartial investigation. When the Texas Rangers and FBI investigation is complete, it will be turned over for review by the district attorney, who has indicated it will also be brought before a grand jury,\u201d a Department of Public Safety spokesman said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Sandra Bland was found dead in her jail cell three days after a violent altercation with a state trooper.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Sandra Bland was found dead in her jail cell three days after a violent altercation with a state trooper.", "title": "Trooper Threatened Sandra Bland With Taser", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150722_SandraBland_Johnson.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-07-23T16:46:20+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1fnhrX5"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Sandra Bland was found dead in her jail cell three days after a violent altercation with a state trooper.", "title": "Trooper Threatened Sandra Bland With Taser", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150722_SandraBland_Johnson.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Law", "tag": "overcriminalization", "published_time": "2015-07-22T21:07:48+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-07-23T16:46:20+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Sandra Bland, Brian Encinia, dashcam video"}, "article_summary": "The footage from trooper Brian Encinia\u2019s car initially shows the officer handing Bland a ticket for failing to signal a lane change.\n\u201cGood.\u201dBland was subsequently charged with assaulting a public servant and taken to Waller County Jail.\nThe trooper becomes agitated after Bland refuses to put out her cigarette, repeatedly ordering her to get out of the car.\nBland was found hanging in her jail cell three days later.\nTexas law enforcement released a graphic dashcam video Tuesday showing a routine traffic stop escalate into a violent altercation between Sandra Bland and a state trooper, leading to her arrest."}
