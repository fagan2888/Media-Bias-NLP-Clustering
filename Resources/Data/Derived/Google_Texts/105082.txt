With temperatures in the 90's, Monday was not the day to be without air conditioning. However, that was apparently the case at Northwest Florida Community Hospital.

Friends and relatives of patients told us the air conditioning went out on the second floor of the hospital Monday morning. Some tell NewsChannel 7 that the air units were running on generators. The problem reportedly begin last night, after a power outage.

"To tell them, 'I told y'all,' then things started coming around. They started bringing in portable A/C units and stuff like that. My mother did not need to be sweating in the bed without A/C and she just had back surgery," said Frankie Bryant, a patient's son.

Hospital administrators admit the air conditioning was not working, and had been running on generators, but say the problems have been repaired.
