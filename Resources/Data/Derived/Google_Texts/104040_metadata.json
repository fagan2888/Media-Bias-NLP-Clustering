Lindsey Graham says that Sen. Ted Cruz is not a more acceptable nominee than Donald Trump.\n\nTuesday on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe,\u201d Graham said Trump\u2019s \u201cmessage is not a good message for us. And it will catch up with us in general. So if you really want to make Hillary Clinton president of the United States, vote for Donald Trump. Dishonest beats crazy.\u201d\n\nGraham, who has endorsed Jeb Bush, was asked by NBC\u2019s Willie Geist, \u201cIf Donald Trump is not acceptable candidate to you, Ted Cruz is close behind him in a lot of the polls. Leading him a little bit in Iowa, depending on which poll you look at. Would Ted Cruz be a more acceptable nominee to you then Donald Trump?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Graham insisted. Host Joe Scarborough interjected, \u201cYou\u2019re in trouble then my man.\u201d\n\nSpeaking about Cruz, Graham said, \u201cHe\u2019s going to get killed.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019d rather have Donald Trump the nominee than Ted Cruz?\u201d asked Geist.\n\nGraham did not answer the question, instead arguing, \u201cWhen I think of Evangelical Christians, the first thing in my mind is Donald Trump. No! When I think of problem solver, the first think in my mind is not Ted Cruz.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll I can say, I\u2019ve learned one thing in 20 years. If a law is named after the president of the United States and they\u2019re still president, you\u2019re probably not going to repeal it,\u201d Graham said. Cruz \u201ctook our party down a strange road of shutting down the government to repeal Obamacare and those of us who thought that was a bad tactical choice he said. \u2018You\u2019re actually for Obamacare.\u2019 I\u2019ll never forget that.\u201d\n\nGraham then compared Cruz to Joe McCarthy, the Cold War-era anti-Communist crusading senator, saying, \u201cThat\u2019s Joe McCarthy stuff because you disagree with how to repeal Obamacare, you\u2019re for the thing that you actually are against. I don\u2019t like that kind of politicking.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ll tear him to shreds,\u201d Graham said. \u201cAt the end of the day the next president needs to be ready on day one to be commander-in-chief and bring this country together. I don\u2019t think Donald Trump and Ted Cruz are ready on day one to be commander-in-chief. They can\u2019t bring this country together and Jeb Bush can. He will beat Hillary Clinton.\u201d\n\nWATCH:\n\nFollow Steve on Twitter and Facebook", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Steve Guest", "description": "Lindsey Graham said that Sen.
