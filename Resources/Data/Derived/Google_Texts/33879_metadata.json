However, the data also revealed that nine Pioneer ACO participants had withdrawn or transferred to MSSP, with some citing financial concerns. For example, the University of Michigan Health System in a July 2013 release announced its decision to transition to MSSP, citing differences in the way the programs measure quality and cost of care as a reason for the switch.\n\nJust last week, San Diego-based Sharp HealthCare announced that it would drop out of the Pioneer program, citing the program\u2019s financial model. Sharp HealthCare is the 10th participant to exit the program, meaning that just 22 of the original 32 participants remain.\n\nAlison Fleury, CEO of Sharp\u2019s ACO, told Modern Healthcare that the system broke even during the first two years of the program and lowered hospital readmission rates while improving the quality of care. However, she said, \u201cBecause the Pioneer financial model is based on national financial trend factors that are not adjusted for specific conditions that an ACO is facing in a particular region, the model was financially detrimental to Sharp ACO despite favorable underlying utilization and quality performance.\u201d\n\nIn addition, CMS data showed 54 of the 114 MSSP participants had lower-than-projected costs in their first year. Of those, just 29 produced enough savings to earn significant bonus payments, while the other 60 participants\u2019 spending exceeded their benchmark.\n\nA Brookings Institute blog post \u2014 by Larry Kocot, a visiting fellow in the Economic Studies program at the Brookings Institution, and the Brookings Institution\u2019s Engelberg Center for Health Care Reform\u2019s Farzad Mostashari and Ross White \u2014 details the challenges several ACO participants faced, including:\n\nCollecting and reporting quality measures in an efficient manner;\n\nCreating incentives for stakeholders to be engaged and committed to the ACO;\n\nDeveloping IT systems to support clinical transformation;\n\nForming appropriate governance structures; and\n\nInterpreting CMS data and reconciling it with their internal data.\n\nAccording to the blog post, \u201cFor these reasons, it is unreasonable to expect a majority of ACOs to be able to satisfy both criteria for shared savings \u2014 reducing costs and improving quality \u2014 in their first, or perhaps even second or third year.\u201d\n\nChecking in With PCMHs\n\nPatient-centered medical homes typically use a team-based approach that focuses on care coordination, prevention, and increased communication and decision-making between patients and their providers. The focus on increased patient involvement has led many PCMHs to invest in health information technology, such as patient registries and electronic health records.\n\nThe federally qualified health center advanced care practice is the innovation center\u2019s main demonstration project. It examines the ability of PCMHs to improve care and reduce costs. According to CMS data, there are nearly 470 participating clinics and health care organizations.\n\nIn an interview with California Healthline, Mark Friedberg, senior natural scientist at RAND Corp., clarified that there are many studies being conducted examining various aspects of the medical home concept \u2014 including studies of medical home interventions and medical home models, which are related but distinct types of studies that are not directly comparable to each other. He said that reaction to the medical home model so far has been \u201cmixed to positive.\u201d\n\nFriedberg said he has not yet seen a successful example of a medical home intervention (in other words, a pilot intended to help practices achieve medical home models) in a peer-reviewed journal. His own study, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, questioned the ability of a multipayer medical home intervention to reduce health care spending and improve quality. Similarly, a separate survey published in the journal Health Affairs concluded that few PCMHs have been able to engage patients successfully.\n\nMeanwhile, some insurer-run PCMHs have reported success in both reducing costs and improving quality metrics.\n\nFor example, CareFirst BlueCross BlueShield \u2014 which runs a four-year-old PCMH initiative in the District of Columbia, Maryland and Northern Virginia \u2014 reported that its PCMH helped reduce the length of patient stays at hospitals, as well as overall hospitalizations among participating patients. The insurer reported $130 million in overall savings, or about 3.5%, compared with its estimated spending under the fee-for-service reimbursement system.\n\nLooking Forward\n\nThe conflicting data surrounding PCMHs and the withdrawal of nearly one-third of Pioneer ACO participants begs the question: Will these ACA care models ultimately be successful and will there be substantial data to make that assessment?\n\nPCMHs\n\nSome experts say that despite the conflicting data and ongoing studies examining various parts of PCMHs it is premature to try to determine the full benefits of the program or ways to improve them.\n\nFriedberg said it could take a few more years before researchers have a clear picture of what PCMH interventions are most successful and efficient.\n\nSimilarly, Amy Cheslock, vice president of payment innovation at WellPoint, during an Alliance for Health Reform briefing earlier this summer said her organization expects to see mixed results while providers and insurers participating in PCMHs tackle major changes in care coordination and delivery. She said, \u201cThis isn\u2019t like a light switch where you turn it on and it is universally better.\u201d\n\nACOs\n\nMeanwhile, the future and success of the CMS\u2019 two ACO programs have drawn mixed responses from health care experts and participants.\n\nSeveral Pioneer ACO participants \u2014 including CHE Trinity Health, St. Vincent\u2019s Health Partners and Universal American \u2014 sent letters to CMS arguing that the program\u2019s rules force ACOs to take on a large amount of risk with little control over the outcome, concerns cited by some of the participants that have exited the program.\n\nHowever, not all ACO participants have reported such difficulties. Andrew Racine \u2014 senior vice president and chief medical officer at Montefiore Medical Center \u2014 and Stephen Rosenthal \u2014 vice president of network management at Montefiore \u2014 in an email to California Healthline described the program as both \u201cexciting\u201d and \u201crevealing.\u201d Racine and Rosenthal expressed confidence in the program and reported no concerns over the 10 Pioneer ACO participants that have withdrawn or transitioned to the MSSP \u2014 a program that has attracted the attention of some health care experts.\n\nMostashri, former National Coordinator for Health IT, told California Healthline that in light of the issues faced by several Pioneer ACO participants, ACOs\u2019 real success or failure will be determined by how MSSP participants fare, not necessarily the Pioneers.\n\nHe said, \u201cValuable lessons can be learned from the Pioneer ACOs, but the real action now is in MSSP,\u201d which has more than 300 participants, including physician-led organizations, that are generating measurable results.\n\nAround the Nation\n\nHere\u2019s what else is making news on the road to reform.\n\nWill the next Medicaid expansion holdout please step forward?
