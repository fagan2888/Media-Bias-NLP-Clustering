This debate represents a battle between Ronald Reagan-style conservative economic policy and Barack Obama-style liberal economic policy.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\n\u201cFor years and years and years, he\u2019s kind of been the key economic voice at the New York Times, and for 10 years I was the economic correspondent for the Wall Street Journal for the editorial page so it\u2019s sort of also Wall Street Journal versus New York Times,\u201d Moore said when asked about his face-off with Krugman. \u201cBut the sort of real debate is over, the whole theme is socialism versus capitalism. I kind of feel sorry for Paul Krugman because there couldn\u2019t be possibly a worse time for him to defend socialism when we see what\u2019s happening in Greece and we see what\u2019s happening in Puerto Rico and we see what\u2019s happening in these South American countries. China has moved more toward socialism and their stock market is collapsing. So, I think it\u2019s a pretty easy debate to say socialism is very like the Berlin wall coming down when Communism collapsed. It\u2019s a system that only works until you run out of other people\u2019s money and these countries are running out of other people\u2019s money.\u201d\n\nMoore added that these liberal economic policies led to so many collapses worldwide.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what\u2019s caused so many of these financial disasters around the world,\u201d Moore said. \u201cI\u2019m really going to hit him on that and I\u2019m also going to hit him on how he was one of the key architects of Obamanomics. Obamanomics has underperformed in every single regard. Obamanomics has not created the jobs, we\u2019re 7 to 8 million jobs behind where we should be. Our GPD is about $2.5 trillion below where it should be if we had a Reagan-style expansion. Reagan\u2019s expansion was based on capitalism and Obama\u2019s expansion has been based on socialism.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think it will be interesting to see how he responds to my charge that the people who have been hurt the most by Obama\u2019s policies, which have really been outside of Krugman\u2019s textbook, have been middle and low income people,\u201d he continued. \u201cThe left always says how much they care about the poor and the poor have really been hurt by Obama\u2019s policies. They don\u2019t have the jobs, they don\u2019t the good-paying jobs, they\u2019re losing income, blacks, hispanics, young people and single women have always been the big losers under Obama.\u201d\n\nListen to the full audio interview with this reporter and watch the full video with Breitbart\u2019s Michelle Moons below.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Exclusive \u2014 Moore: Krugman Will Defend Obamanomics Which Is Based on Socialism", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Exclusive \u2014 Moore: Krugman Will Defend Obamanomics Which Is Based on Socialism", "title": "Exclusive \u2014 Moore: Krugman Will Defend Obamanomics Which Is Based on Socialism - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/07/Obama-Wisconsin.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/07/09/exclusive-moore-krugman-will-defend-obamanomics-which-is-based-on-socialism/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Exclusive \u2014 Moore: Krugman Will Defend Obamanomics Which Is Based on Socialism", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/07/Obama-Wisconsin.jpg", "title": "Exclusive \u2014 Moore: Krugman Will Defend Obamanomics Which Is Based on Socialism - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "app_id": 1243316582352556, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "capitalism, Freedom Fest, obamanomics, Paul Krugman, socialism, Stephen Moore,Big Government, Economics, Obama,obamanomics", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Big Government", "tag": "Stephen Moore", "published_time": "2015-07-09T05:32:15-07:00", "categories": "Big Government,Obama,Economics"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc977\"", "article_summary": "Moore is debating Krugman on Friday morning in Las Vegas at Freedom Fest.\nSo, I think it\u2019s a pretty easy debate to say socialism is very like the Berlin wall coming down when Communism collapsed.\nObamanomics has not created the jobs, we\u2019re 7 to 8 million jobs behind where we should be.\nThis debate represents a battle between Ronald Reagan-style conservative economic policy and Barack Obama-style liberal economic policy.\n\u201cBut the sort of real debate is over, the whole theme is socialism versus capitalism."}
