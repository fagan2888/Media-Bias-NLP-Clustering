I\u2019ve never seen a party that doesn\u2019t grab opportunities thrown at it like this,\u201d he declared. And \u201cthey [Republicans] should be taking this issue and making it a national referendum issue against every Democrat, and for every Republican in the country.\u201d\n\nHe speculated that Republicans have not made executive amnesty an issue because \u201cthey have a lot of donors, and a lot of their lobbyists telling them they want this. The Chamber of Commerce wants open borders, the Wall Street Journal wants open borders.\u201d\n\nCaddell slammed Republicans for not making executive amnesty a main issue in 2014, arguing, \u201cthese Republicans don\u2019t seem to understand that the country is in a massive shift. Huge majorities saying the president doesn\u2019t have the authority to do this, he shouldn\u2019t do it without the Congress, and they should challenge it, even in New York.\u201d And \u201cholding the ball is the worse strategy, it is a disaster. The Republicans lost the Senate that they should have won in 2000 and 2012, because they refused to quote \u2018be controversial about anything.\u2019\u201d\n\nFollow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett", "article_metadata": {"description": "Former Democratic pollster Pat Caddell blasted the Republican Party for not making the president's planned executive amnesty a national issue on Friday's", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Former Democratic pollster Pat Caddell blasted the Republican Party for not making the president's planned executive amnesty a national issue on Friday's", "title": "Caddell: Republicans Are 'Stupid Party' for Not Running Against Amnesty - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Breitbart-TV/2014/10/10/Caddell%20Thumbnail.jpg", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/video/2014/10/10/caddell-republicans-are-stupid-party-for-not-running-against-amnesty/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Former Democratic pollster Pat Caddell blasted the Republican Party for not making the president's planned executive amnesty a national issue on Friday's", "title": "Caddell: Republicans Are 'Stupid Party' for Not Running Against Amnesty - Breitbart", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Breitbart-TV/2014/10/10/Caddell%20Thumbnail.jpg", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true", "app_id": 1243316582352556}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Neil Cavuto, Senate, Twitter,Breitbart TV,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Breitbart TV", "tag": "Twitter", "published_time": "2014-10-10T16:22:22-07:00", "categories": "Breitbart TV"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd011c\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThe Republican Party, they\u2019re not called the stupid party for nothing.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERFormer Democratic pollster Pat Caddell blasted the Republican Party for not making the president\u2019s planned executive amnesty a national issue on Friday\u2019s \u201cYour World with Neil Cavuto\u201d on the Fox News Channel.\nThe Chamber of Commerce wants open borders, the Wall Street Journal wants open borders.\u201dCaddell slammed Republicans for not making executive amnesty a main issue in 2014, arguing, \u201cthese Republicans don\u2019t seem to understand that the country is in a massive shift.\nI\u2019ve never seen a party that doesn\u2019t grab opportunities thrown at it like this,\u201d he declared.\nThese people are able to, are willing to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory given the opportunity,\u201d he stated."}
