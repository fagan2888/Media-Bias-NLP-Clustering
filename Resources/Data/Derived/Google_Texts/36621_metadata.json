She lived on fast food and was an admitted couch potato.\n\n\u201cI ate out a lot and it would be a salad, bread, the entr\u00e9e, and dessert. It would be all of it,\" Jones confessed. \"When I got fast food, it would be chicken fingers and fries. It was just a free for all. There was no exercise.\u201d\n\nJacinda had experienced weight problems since her youth, but her life changing moment came on an airplane in 2010.\n\n\u201cI had went to Vegas, and the seat belt buckle wouldn\u2019t and I was too embarrassed to ask for the extender,\" she said.\n\nFollowing the trip, she began thinking about gastric bypass surgery.\n\n\u201cMy mom told me I needed to have the surgery, and I was so scared of surgery, I told her to give me one more shot to do this, and I told her if it fails this time, I will have the surgery,\" remarked Jones.\n\nAt 32 years old, Jacinda was obese and pre-diabetic. She had high blood pressure and no energy.\n\n\u201cI also developed what\u2019s called benign intracranial hypertension. It\u2019s where my body either doesn\u2019t get rid of or makes too much spinal fluid because of my weight,\" she explained. \"It would give me headaches because I had too much pressure on my spine, and it also pushed on my optic nerves and I could have gone blind. I went to an opthamologist and he said you\u2019ve got to lose weight.\u201d\n\nThe woman who once weighed 350 pounds and struggled to get her seat belt fastened on an airplane is now training to run in a 5K.\n\nAnd then she turned to an unexpected place: her job. Jacinda works as a claims specialist for Progressive Insurance in the company\u2019s Bowling Green office. She began taking advantage of the company\u2019s employee wellness program called Healthy U.\n\nProgressive offers employees a host of healthy living tools such as on-site fitness centers and health clinics, exercise and nutrition coaching, gym membership reimbursement, and fitness challenges.\n\n\u201cFor us, we see it as really critical to the success of the company in the sense that you need to have happy and healthy employees,\" replied Lynn Major, Business Leader of Compensation and Benefits at Progressive. \u201cWhen people are happy and healthy they want to come to work, they\u2019re able to come to work, so you don\u2019t have absenteeism issues, but you also have people who are fully engaged. They\u2019re feeling good, so they\u2019re going to be productive.\u201d\n\nProgressive is among 50 percent of the nation\u2019s employers offering some type of employee wellness program, according to a recent survey from the Rand Corporation. Lynn Major says healthy workers save themselves and the company money.\n\n\u201cIn our instance, at Progressive, we pay a significant portion to cover our employees from a medical plan standpoint, but the employee also participates in that cost. By an employee caring about their own health and wellness, it reduces their costs too. Obviously, they\u2019re contributing to the cost of paying for their medical coverage, as well,\" Major added.\n\nWorkplace wellness programs are also becoming more popular at universities. Ben Spitler works at WKU as a maintenance technician. Ben hardly ever went to the doctor, but last year he decided to have a biometric screening at the health clinic on campus. That\u2019s when he found out that he had high cholesterol, which made sense, given his family history of heart disease.\n\n\u201cMy dad\u2019s father had his first heart attack in his 50s and ended up having open heart surgery and died in his 60s. My father just had his first heart attack at 55 just a few weeks ago,\" explained Spitler. \"It\u2019s definitely something that hits home and something I want to get a handle on before I get into my 40s or 50s.\u201d\n\nHis doctor wanted to put Ben on a cholesterol-lowering drug.\n\n\u201cI told him I\u2019d really like to try to get it down on my own. I didn\u2019t be on the medicine in my 30s. He said as high as mine was, the chances of getting it down weren\u2019t very good,\" Spitler commented. \"I said to give me six months, and after that six months, he was shocked.\u201d\n\nIn that time, Ben had dropped his cholesterol by 85 points and lost 30 pounds. The university rewarded his success with a one-time cash payment, which Ben says paid for his gym membership.\n\nWKU launched a revamped employee wellness program last January to help employees target chronic health conditions like heart disease and diabetes.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s interesting that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that 75 percent of overall health care in this country is associated with chronic illnesses,\" explained Wade Pinkard, Employee Wellness Manager at WKU.\n\nThose chronic conditions, Pinkard says, are associated with four lifestyle behaviors that we all have control over: physical inactivity, a poor diet, smoking, and too much alcohol. The employee wellness program at WKU offers employees health screenings and website for exercise and nutrition coaching, as well as incentives for joining Weight Watchers and smoking cessation programs.\n\nIn the program\u2019s first year, Pinkard says nearly half of faculty and staff completed at least one activity.\n\n\u201cAnecdotally, we\u2019ve had several employees report to us that they were unaware they were border line hypertensive, they hadn\u2019t had their blood pressure checked in some time, and that came out during the screening process,\" he replied. \"Another individual who had very high cholesterol, he followed up with his primary care physician and was put on medication. He made some lifestyle changes with help through the program and was able to get off that medication as a result.\u201d\n\nMost employee wellness programs precede the Affordable Care Act, but the federal health care law is likely to get more employers on board. Obamacare gives employers with wellness programs more latitude to increase insurance premiums on workers who don\u2019t meet certain health guidelines.\n\nSoeren Mattke is a Senior Scientist at the Rand Corporation, a non-profit research group. He took one major corporation and studied its wellness program over a seven-year period.\n\n\u201cWhat we found is that the overall program returned $1.50 for every $1 invested,\" explained Mattke.\n\nBased on his research, Mattke says workplace wellness programs offer employers no immediate financial benefit, but long-term, they can lead to reduced health care costs.\n\nIn the two years since Jacinda Jones began her weight loss journey, she has dropped more than 150 pounds. It\u2019s easy to see how she has physically changed, but Jacinda says her emotional transformation has been just as spectacular. Sharon Bessette is Jacinda\u2019s supervisor.\n\n\u201cBefore Jacinda began her weight loss routine and her goal to change her life, she was a very quiet, introverted person, not much interaction, did her own thing, not a lot of confidence. Once she made the decision to start losing weight and live healthier, she became a whole new person,\" remarked Bessette. \"Her confidence was out the roof, she performed better at work, she had a more bubbly personality and attitude about life when interacting with people. She\u2019s done a 180 from where she was before.\u201d\n\nThe 350 pound woman who felt hopeless two years ago is right now training for a 5-K. Today, Jacinda exercises regularly, eats out less, and counts calories.\n\n\u201cBut there are those times that I just get bored and I\u2019ll eat when I\u2019m bored. I eat when I\u2019m happy, I eat when I\u2019m sad,\" Jones said. \"It\u2019s hard, it\u2019s still hard to this day.\u201d\n\nKeeping the weight off will be a lifetime chore, but her employer, she says, has her back.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Health", "description": "At 170 pounds, Jacinda Jones is half the woman she used to be. \u201cI\u2019d managed to get up to 350, actually I don\u2019t know the exact weight because my scale", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://wkyufm.org/post/bowling-green-woman-credits-dramatic-weight-loss-employer", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/wkyu/files/styles/medium/public/201401/JACINDA1.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "At 170 pounds, Jacinda Jones is half the woman she used to be. \u201cI\u2019d managed to get up to 350, actually I don\u2019t know the exact weight because my scale", "title": "Bowling Green Woman Credits Dramatic Weight Loss to Employer"}, "story_id": 267031802, "twitter": {"site": "@wkupublicradio", "card": "summary", "creator": "@wkupublicradio"}, "author": "Lisa Autry", "org_id": 0, "dc": {"title": "Bowling Green Woman Credits Dramatic Weight Loss to Employer"}, "nid": 42873, "datePublished": "2014-01-27", "keywords": "health, Bowling Green", "wordCount": 1419, "has_audio": 1, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc1ad\"", "article_summary": "She began taking advantage of the company\u2019s employee wellness program called Healthy U.\nHe took one major corporation and studied its wellness program over a seven-year period.\nWKU launched a revamped employee wellness program last January to help employees target chronic health conditions like heart disease and diabetes.\nObamacare gives employers with wellness programs more latitude to increase insurance premiums on workers who don\u2019t meet certain health guidelines.\nWorkplace wellness programs are also becoming more popular at universities."}
