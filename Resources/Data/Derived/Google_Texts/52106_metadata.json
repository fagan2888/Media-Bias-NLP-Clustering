Last April, angry mobs torched the city of Baltimore on the day of the funeral for Freddie Gray, an African-American man who died while being transported to jail in police custody. Reports revealed they had failed to strap him into a seatbelt in the police van, leaving him vulnerable to spinal cord injuries. The incident was described as reckless endangerment.\n\nThe first trial, involving Officer William Porter, ended in a hung jury last December. Five more trials for the officers involved are expected in the coming months.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Officer Edward Nero not guilty in Freddie Gray case..05/27/2016 9:42:47AM EST.", "author": "Cortney O'Brien", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Officer Edward Nero not guilty in Freddie Gray case.", "title": "Not Guilty: Officer Nero Fully Acquitted in Freddie Gray Trial", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/cortneyobrien/2016/05/23/freddie-gray-trial-n2167384", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2016/133/95dd6520-cb47-4d9f-96e0-f0a039a7055d.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Officer Edward Nero not guilty in Freddie Gray case.", "title": "Not Guilty: Officer Nero Fully Acquitted in Freddie Gray Trial", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/cortneyobrien/2016/05/23/freddie-gray-trial-n2167384", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2016/133/95dd6520-cb47-4d9f-96e0-f0a039a7055d.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Not Guilty: Officer Nero Fully Acquitted in Freddie Gray Trial, Cortney O'Brien, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "The first trial, involving Officer William Porter, ended in a hung jury last December.\nOfficer Edward Nero, one of six police officers who were charged in the death of Freddie Gray last year, has been acquitted of all charges after a hearing in Baltimore on Monday.\nLast April, angry mobs torched the city of Baltimore on the day of the funeral for Freddie Gray, an African-American man who died while being transported to jail in police custody.\nOf course, the concern is whether or not the unrest will escalate into the violence we witnessed last year.\nReports revealed they had failed to strap him into a seatbelt in the police van, leaving him vulnerable to spinal cord injuries."}
