On November 4th, the city\u2019s voters will decide whether to tax sodas and other sugar-sweetened beverages.\n\n\u2018My entire family has been a part of activism around Berkeley.\u2019\n\n\u2014 Dr. Vicki Alexander\n\nNo such tax has ever passed anywhere in the nation.\n\nThe effort is bringing out progressives in Berkeley who have lobbied for social change for decades. Berkeley city leaders and health advocates have joined a coalition to support the measure, in hopes of igniting a nationwide fight against soda consumption. Meanwhile, the beverage industry is spending big to defeat the measure.\n\nA History of Activism\n\nThe supporters of Measure D see it as the next chapter in Berkeley\u2019s history of social activism. Dr. Vicki Alexander has been working on public health and other social issues in this community for half a century.\n\n\u201cMy entire family has been a part of activism around Berkeley,\u201d says Alexander. \u201cThe Free Speech Movement the Free Mandela Movement \u2014 just one after another after another \u2014 we were involved.\u201d\n\nAlexander was there 50 years ago at UC Berkeley confrontation at Sproul Hall between students and the administration \u2014 a confrontation credited with launching the Free Speech Movement. Berkeley also helped launch an effort toward healthy eating, led by Alice Waters and Berkeley\u2019s schoolyard gardens.\n\nTwo years ago, funding cuts threatened some of those gardens, and the seed was planted for the beverage tax, says Alexander.\n\n\u201cThe parents of the kids who benefited from the gardens in the schools,\u201d Alexander says, \u201cand people in the community who benefited from the gardens started [asking], \u2018How can we have a source of funding that\u2019s ongoing?\u2019\u201d\n\nBuilding A Coalition\n\nThey knew they were taking on a tough opponent \u2014 the beverage industry. Beverage taxes have been tried in 30 cities and states. They\u2019ve all failed.\n\nThe opposition often successfully argues that this kind of tax would hurt low-income minority communities. So early on Berkeley activists began building a coalition that included African-Americans and Latinos.\n\nCarol McGruder works with the Berkeley chapter of the NAACP. She says she\u2019s involved as part of her focus on health in the African-American community. She says she was \u201cvery disappointed\u201d when New York City\u2019s local NAACP sided against the ban on large servings of soda that was proposed there.\n\n\u201cAnd in Richmond I know that big soda hired a lot of people from the community, from minority groups, to do telephone polling against it,\u201c McGruder says.\n\nThe Berkeley pro-tax campaign is also tapping into a broad network of community groups. Take the Ecology Center. It\u2019s been around for more than 40 years, and is known for pioneering Berkeley\u2019s curbside recycling program.\n\nThe Ecology Center marshaled resources including campaign foot soldiers like 22-year-old Kad Smith, who works on nutrition programs for the center. He\u2019s spending weekends canvassing, and his evenings phone banking.\n\n\u201cOur message is that there is an overwhelming and urgent health crisis in our community,\u201d says Smith. \u201cWe see those disparities especially in south and west Berkeley, which is a low-income community, which is also populated by a lot of people of color. It\u2019s an overwhelming health crisis with obesity, diabetes.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cyes\u201d campaign is also drawing support from outside the community. Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who tried and failed to put a cap on the size of sodas sold in that city, recently donated $85,000 to the Berkeley effort.\n\nBig Money From a Big Opponent\n\nDrive around Berkeley and you will see bright red \u201cYes on D\u201d signs blooming in yard after yard, suggesting the measure\u2019s success is at hand. But the beverage industry is very good at fighting this fight, very good at sowing doubt about the benefits of this kind of tax. So far they\u2019ve spent more than $1.6 million dollars in Berkeley.\n\nAt the Ashby BART station, it\u2019s easy to see where some of that money is going. There are signs everywhere that say, \u201cMeasure D is not what is seems.\u201d A bunch of them have a big piece of glossy fruit that on the outside looks like an apple and on the inside looks like an orange. The tagline says, \u201cOn November 4th, vote no on Measure D.\u201d\n\nKatie Merrill is a democratic political strategist based in Berkeley. She says the beverage industry\u2019s tactics work. It\u2019s easier to kill this kind of measure than to pass it.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re hearing the measure is flawed, it won\u2019t do what it says it will; the money won\u2019t be spent in the way that the proponents say it will.\u201d says Merrill.\n\nThe beverage industry argues there\u2019s no guarantee the tax income will support school gardens or other health programs. Instead it will end up in Berkeley\u2019s general fund, where it could be used to pay for anything.\n\nCampaign spokesman Roger Salazar says the anti-tax support is coming from some unions and small businesses.\n\nJoshua Kemper owns one of those small businesses, Smokey J\u2019s BBQ on Shattuck Avenue. Campaign fliers for No on D cover the tables in his small restaurant. He says the tax could hurt his business.\n\n\u201cIt would be passed onto the people that buy stuff here,\u201d Kemper says. \u201cThat\u2019s increasing the cost of the overall food. They\u2019re spending more money when they come here, but I don\u2019t see any of that.\u201d\n\nTo get their message out, the no campaign is also paying teams of young people, some from as far away as Hayward, who are going door to door, every day until the election. They\u2019re articulate and very persuasive. Salazar says they\u2019re relying on that kind of street outreach.\n\n\u201cThey go out, share the information that we have,\u201d says Salazar. \u201cEncourage them to read the initiative for themselves.\u201d\n\nIs Big Soda The Next Big Tobacco?\n\n\u201cBerkeley vs. Big Soda\u201d is the official tag line of the Yes on D campaign. The slogan is featured on their t-shirts, their yard signs, and is even the campaign\u2019s website URL. Proponents argue that there are parallels between the soda industry and tobacco companies.\n\nThe Yes on D campaign even hosted a forum called \u201cIs Soda The New Tobacco,\u201d featuring Stan Glantz, a UCSF professor of medicine who has long fought for public health policies, including tobacco taxes to reduce smoking.\n\nPolitical strategist Katie Merrill says those who think they can take on the soda industry should consider it a long haul.\n\n\u201cThe soda industry is not the tobacco industry, it\u2019s not the oil industry,\u201d says Merrill. \u201cPeople haven\u2019t spent 30 years in high visibility battles against the soda industry\u201d\n\nStill, it\u2019s just that kind of battle that Berkeley activists say they\u2019re known for.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Proponents have built a coalition; the beverage industry is fighting back hard.", "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"In Berkeley, Soda Tax Measure Is New Front in Social Activism\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/2014\\/10\\/20\\/in-berkeley-soda-tax-measure-is-new-front-in-social-activism\\/\",\"pub_date\":\"2014-10-20 10:39:24\",\"mod_date\":\"2014-10-23 11:41:02\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":22116,\"author_id\":\"8344\",\"author_name\":\"State of Health\",\"author_display_name\":\"State of Health\",\"tags\":[\"Measure D\",\"Soda Tax\"],\"categories\":[\"Community Health\",\"Policy\"],\"image\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/sites\\/27\\/2014\\/10\\/Screen-Shot-2014-10-20-at-10.36.01-AM-e1413826601647.png\"}", "og": {"site_name": "State of Health", "description": "Proponents have built a coalition; the beverage industry is fighting back hard.", "title": "In Berkeley, Soda Tax Measure Is New Front in Social Activism", "url": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/2014/10/20/in-berkeley-soda-tax-measure-is-new-front-in-social-activism/", "image": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/wp-content/uploads/sites/27/2014/10/Screen-Shot-2014-10-20-at-10.36.01-AM-640x417.png", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@kqedhealth", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@"}, "fb": {"app_id": 160023622793}, "keywords": "measure d,soda tax", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "\u201cThe soda industry is not the tobacco industry, it\u2019s not the oil industry,\u201d says Merrill.\nPolitical strategist Katie Merrill says those who think they can take on the soda industry should consider it a long haul.\nTwo years ago, funding cuts threatened some of those gardens, and the seed was planted for the beverage tax, says Alexander.\n\u201cEncourage them to read the initiative for themselves.\u201dIs Big Soda The Next Big Tobacco?\nProponents argue that there are parallels between the soda industry and tobacco companies."}
