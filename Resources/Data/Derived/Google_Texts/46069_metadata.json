From ancient Athens to George Orwell, the violation of the integrity of language by sophistical legerdemain has been recognized as the eternal enabler of political tyranny.\n\nThe 6-3 decision, which legitimized giving federal subsidies to people living in states without an exchange, obviously contradicts the law as written. What the majority of the Court did was to rewrite legislation in clear violation of the Constitution\u2019s separation of powers, which gives the law-making power to Congress. As Justice Scalia wrote in dissent, the majority \u201cignores the American people\u2019s decision to give Congress \u2018[a]ll legislative Powers\u2019 enumerated in the Constitution. They made Congress, not this Court, responsible for both making laws and mending them.\u201d\n\nThis usurpation of legislative power in turn depended on ignoring the plain language of the law. Again Scalia: \u201cWords no longer have meaning if an Exchange that is not established by a State is \u2018established by the State.\u2019\u201d One recalls Thucydides\u2019 famous observations on the corruption of language by contests for political domination: \u201cWords had to change their ordinary meaning and to take that which was now given them.\u201d So too in King vs. Burwell, the majority has changed the \u201cordinary meaning\u201d of the word \u201cstate\u201d and made it take on the meaning \u201cfederal government.\u201d\n\nYet this political abuse of language by the Court is nothing new. In the first Obamacare case three years ago, National Federation of Independent Business vs. Sebelius, Justice Roberts justified unconstitutionally imposing a financial \u201cpenalty\u201d on those without medical insurance by calling it a \u201ctax,\u201d rewriting the law in contradiction of the frequently publicized intent of those writing the law that the penalty was not a tax. The \u201cordinary meaning\u201d of \u201cpenalty\u201d was changed to \u201ctax.\u201d Just as \u201cWar is Peace\u201d and \u201cIgnorance is Strength\u201d in 1984\u2019s Oceania, now in America \u201cState is Federal Government\u201d and \u201cPenalty is Tax.\u201d\n\nBut long before these two decisions we have been subjected to bad laws predicated on disrespect for clear language. Sexual harassment law, with its vague language like \u201chostile and intimidating,\u201d has been an inducement to use the law as a weapon in interpersonal and professional disputes by inviting subjective, irrational, self-interested, and preposterous interpretations of what constitutes \u201chostile and intimidating.\u201d Title IX similarly encourages using subjective or even neurotic \u201cfeelings\u201d to determine that a woman \u201con the basis of sex\u201d has been discriminated against. These laws violate one of the fundamental aims of clear writing\u2013\u2013 precision. It is no wonder, then, that they have generated countless acts of injustice and censorship backed by the coercive power of the state.\n\nUsing vague language and violating the clear meaning of words undermine the fundamental idea opposed to tyranny\u2013\u2013that citizens are ruled by laws and not men, for a free state functions by verbal deliberation and written laws. Thus the precision and stability of language lies at the heart of political freedom. Scalia alludes to this fundamental principle: \u201cThe Court forgets that ours is a government of laws and not of men. That means we are governed by the terms of our laws, not by the unenacted will of our lawmakers.\u201d And both rulings have replaced the legislative mechanism for exercising that \u201crule by law\u201d\u2013\u2013 elected representatives, accountable to the people, write the laws\u2013\u2013with rule by decree based on the ideological preferences or prejudices of an elite.\n\nIn \u201cPolitics and the English Language,\u201d Orwell said, \u201cPolitical speech and writing are largely the defense of the indefensible,\u201d and \u201cPolitical language . . . is designed to make lies sound truthful.\u201d The corrupted, dishonest language of these Supreme Court decisions is an expression of political, not legal speech, and the effect is to defend both the indefensible weakening of the Constitution, and the concentration of power in the federal government.\n\nIn other words, these decisions are serving the century-long progressive program of replacing a republic of separated powers designed to protect freedom and individual rights, with a technocratic oligarchy of concentrated and expanding powers designed to aggrandize itself and eliminate the mediating institutions\u2013\u2013state governments, churches, businesses, and private organizations\u2013\u2013that could check its ambitions. We see this aim in the writings of Woodrow Wilson, who in 1887 complained that the president \u201cwas empowered [by the veto] to prevent bad laws, but he was not to be given an opportunity to make good ones,\u201d and who longed to \u201copen for the public a bureau of skilled, economical administration\u201d made up of the \u201chundreds who are wise\u201d empowered to rule the thousands who are \u201cselfish, ignorant, timid, stubborn, or foolish.\u201d We read it too in Progressivism\u2019s foremost theorist, Herbert Croly, when in 1909 he wrote, \u201cThe people are not Sovereign as individuals . . . They become Sovereign only in so far as they succeed in reaching and expressing a collective purpose.\u201d And we hear it in a speech of FDR in 1932, when he spoke of \u201cmodifying and controlling our economic units,\u201d \u201cdistributing wealth and products more equitably,\u201d qualifying \u201cthe freedom of action of individual units within the business,\u201d and effecting \u201cthe re-definition of these rights [of property] in terms of a changing and growing social order.\u201d\n\nToday it\u2019s obvious that the progressives\u2019 \u201ccollective purpose\u201d is being realized: for decades the federal government has been subordinating businesses and churches to the federal government, weakening the powers of the sovereign states, pursuing \u201csocial justice\u201d through laws written by anonymous, unelected, unaccountable executive office functionaries, and working to achieve radical egalitarianism by the redistribution of property through tax law and social welfare entitlements. What is missing from this \u201ccollective purpose\u201d are the foundational purposes of the American Republic: the protection of individual rights and property, the fostering of political freedom and autonomy, and defending both freedom and rights against the tyrannical ambitions of elites and masses alike. Rather, today we see at work \u2013\u2013in the executive tyranny of Barack Obama, in the intrusive regulatory power of unelected agencies like the IRS and the EPA, and in the hubris of the Supreme Court in rewriting plainly written law to serve the progressive agenda\u2013\u2013the \u201cnew instruments of public power\u201d of the sort that FDR boasted about in 1936. Lost has been the Founders\u2019 concern to protect the people\u2019s freedom from the tendency of power to corrupt those who possess it.\n\nThis dismantling of the Constitutional political order has depended on the corruption of language. As Orwell wrote in 1946, \u201cOne ought to recognise that the present political chaos is connected with the decay of language, and that one can probably bring about some improvement by starting at the verbal end.\u201d If we want to recover our political heritage, we need, as Scalia did in his dissent, to continually call out the violence against language that has always accompanied the expansion of tyranny.", "article_metadata": {"rating": "general", "description": "Troubling implications beyond the further erosion of the separation of powers.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"site_name": "Frontpage Mag", "description": "Troubling implications beyond the further erosion of the separation of powers.", "title": "The Orwellian King-Burwell Majority", "url": "http://www.frontpagemag.com/fpm/259234/orwellian-king-burwell-majority-bruce-thornton", "image": "http://www.frontpagemag.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_full/public/uploads/2015/06/king-burwell.jpg?itok=TABoD0lU", "updated_time": "2015-06-29T01:23:42-04:00", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.frontpagemag.com/fpm/259234/orwellian-king-burwell-majority-bruce-thornton", "image": "http://www.frontpagemag.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_full/public/uploads/2015/06/king-burwell.jpg?itok=TABoD0lU", "description": "Troubling implications beyond the further erosion of the separation of powers.", "card": "summary", "title": "The Orwellian King-Burwell Majority"}, "article": {"published_time": "2015-06-29T00:19:43-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-29T01:23:42-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1a67\"", "article_summary": "In \u201cPolitics and the English Language,\u201d Orwell said, \u201cPolitical speech and writing are largely the defense of the indefensible,\u201d and \u201cPolitical language .\nAs Justice Scalia wrote in dissent, the majority \u201cignores the American people\u2019s decision to give Congress \u2018[a]ll legislative Powers\u2019 enumerated in the Constitution.\nWhat the majority of the Court did was to rewrite legislation in clear violation of the Constitution\u2019s separation of powers, which gives the law-making power to Congress.\nThus the precision and stability of language lies at the heart of political freedom.\nThe 6-3 decision, which legitimized giving federal subsidies to people living in states without an exchange, obviously contradicts the law as written."}
