In fact, if Clinton does run, there should be a law that only Rebecca Traister and Rebecca Traister-approved journalists are allowed to write about the campaign. That would be a great law.\n\nBut that is not the law because of the free press being the backbone of a democratic society and all of that. So instead we have to read people like Maureen Dowd write about Clinton and who she really is and everything she may or may not symbolize as a woman in power and what about a grandmother in the White House and is she relatable and where do babies come from and why does my finger hurt every time I do this and Thomas J. can\u2019t see without his glasses why won\u2019t someone put his glasses on?\n\nIn her column for the New York Times this weekend, Dowd compared Clinton to the ice princess from \u201cFrozen\u201d because both are apparently icy women obsessed with control. After concluding that Raymond Chandler\u2019s taxonomy of blonde women does not capture the essence of Clinton or Elsa from \u201cFrozen,\u201d Dowd moves to conjure her own definition of the two women \u2014 one who is an actual person in the world and the other who is a pretend cartoon princess.\n\nDowd observes that these women share problems in common, like freezing everything with their ice powers and scaring people. \u201cThose close to them think that the queen of Hillaryland and the Snow Queen from Disney\u2019s \u201cFrozen\u201d have special magical powers, but worry about whether they can control those powers, show their humanity and stir real warmth in the public heart,\u201d she writes. (Dowd did not disclose the identities of her Washington or Arendelle sources.)\n\nBoth women also want to \u201clet it go\u201d: \u201cAfter feeling stifled at times and misunderstood, after suffering painful setbacks, the powerful and polarizing Elsa and Hillary proclaim from their lofty height that they\u2019re going to \u2018let it go\u2019 and go for it.\u201d\n\nBut whereas Elsa the fictional ice princess was genuinely able to \u201clet it go\u201d without being punished by the people of Arendelle (a bloody coup would have been a downer of a finale and probably precluded a sequel in the franchise), Dowd does not believe Clinton will ever really \u201clet it go\u201d:", "article_metadata": {"description": "Will Hillary \"let it go\" or keep being an icy control freak obsessed with \"caution and calculation\"?", "author": "Katie McDonough", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Will Hillary \"let it go\" or keep being an icy control freak obsessed with \"caution and calculation\"?", "title": "Maureen Dowd compares Hillary Clinton to \u201cFrozen\u201d princess because both are ice queens or something!", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/06/15/maureen_dowd_compares_hillary_clinton_to_frozen_princess_because_both_are_ice_queens_or_something/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/hillary_clinton4.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Will Hillary \"let it go\" or keep being an icy control freak obsessed with \"caution and calculation\"?", "creator": "@kmcdonovgh", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/hillary_clinton4.jpg", "title": "Maureen Dowd compares Hillary Clinton to \u201cFrozen\u201d princess because both are ice queens or something!", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Maureen Dowd compares Hillary Clinton to \u201cFrozen\u201d princess because both are ice queens or something!", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, 2016 Elections, comparing real people to pretend cartoon characters, frozen, Gender, Hillary Clinton, let it go, Maureen Dowd, New York Times, Sexism", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf3f9\"", "article_summary": "In fact, if Clinton does run, there should be a law that only Rebecca Traister and Rebecca Traister-approved journalists are allowed to write about the campaign.\nDowd observes that these women share problems in common, like freezing everything with their ice powers and scaring people.\nIn her column for the New York Times this weekend, Dowd compared Clinton to the ice princess from \u201cFrozen\u201d because both are apparently icy women obsessed with control.\n(Dowd did not disclose the identities of her Washington or Arendelle sources.)\nBut that is not the law because of the free press being the backbone of a democratic society and all of that."}
