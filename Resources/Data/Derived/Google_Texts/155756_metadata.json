Gorgeous, high-minded, beautifully acted and sluggish, it may be a stretch for those more accustomed to the Olivia Pope-Doug Stamper-Ray Donovan versions of fixers.\n\nThe historical drama provides a portrait of Thomas Cromwell, the enigmatic consigliere to King Henry VIII, who cleverly worked the angles in the Tudor court always thinking a few steps ahead. Nothing viewers have seen the murderous modern TV fixers do was beyond his reach.\n\nMark Rylance, the Tony Award-winner rarely seen on American TV, portrays Cromwell as a tortured soul, survivor of an abusive father who tragically lost his family to the plague, who dedicates himself to king and country. Damian Lewis (\u201cHomeland\u201d) plays King Henry VIII, obsessed with producing a male heir to the throne. Claire Foy (\u201cLittle Dorrit\u201d) plays the future queen Anne Boleyn.\n\nRunning Sundays through May 10, it\u2019s all about intrigue and backroom dealings with the Protestant reformation as a backdrop in what \u201cMasterpiece\u201d bills as an \u201cunromanticized retelling.\u201d\n\nFans of Mantel\u2019s Booker Prize-winning novels will rave, those who appreciate costume drama, attention to detail, beautiful cinematography (true to the period, using only natural light) and world-renowned actors will be enthralled. Those who find entertainment value in the \u201cScandal\u201d/\u201dHouse of Cards\u201d/\u201dRay Donovan\u201d versions of power plays and conquests may find \u201cWolf Hall\u201d a tad slow going.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Claire Foy,Damian Lewis,Hilary Mantel,Mark Rylance,Masterpiece,PBS,RMPBS,Thomas Cromwell,Wolf Hall", "language": "en, sv", "og": {"site_name": "Ostrow Off The Record", "description": "\"Wolf Hall,\" the six-hour adaptation of Hilary Mantel's novels, \"Wolf Hall\" and \"Bring Up the Bodies,\" premieres Sunday at 10 p.m. on RMPBS.
