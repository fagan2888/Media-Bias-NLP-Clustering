Nancy Pelosi (D-CA). Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) \u2019s push to pass Obamacare, in which she said infamously said: \u201cwe have to pass the bill so that you can find out what is in it.\u201d\n\nPaul Ryan has come out as a politically transgendered Republican. When he was first elected to Congress, he promised to balance budgets, cut taxes, and hold the president accountable for his actions. But now he's Obama's pointman on Obamatrade. He completed his political reassignment surgery when he said today that we have to pass Obamatrade to find out what's in it .\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s declassified and made public once it\u2019s agreed to,\u201d Ryan said of Obamatrade in Rules Committee testimony on Wednesday. It came right after an incredible exchange where Ryan attempted a ploy to try to save immigration provisions contained within the Obamatrade package as a whole\u2014specifically TiSA\u2014that were exposed by Breitbart News earlier on Wednesday, a problem for which he put forward a phony non-solution designed to get more votes for his Obamatrade agenda but not stop the immigration provisions.\n\nBut Paul Ryan pushing amnesty isn't anything new. He voted with a minority of Republicans and a majority of Democrats to fully fund Homeland Security without any provisions stopping Obama's illegal amnesty. He's voted to raise the debt ceiling repeatedly, and voteed for giant omnibus budgets that no one has read that have fully funded Obamacare.\n\nAt this point, very little separates Paul Ryan from Nancy Pelosi, which is why it seems clear that Ryan is bipolitically fluid. But he is in good standing with the rest of the liberal political transvestites in the GOP, or LGOP as I call them, like his boss John Boehner. Ryan has successfully transitioned from his former political gender not only on the issues, but on the process as well.\n\nRyan has endorsed a style of governance where the government votes on non-national security bills in secret \u2013 that is, where the legislation being voted on is kept from the public until after the vote. This is like something out of the old Soviet Union, but Ryan has no shame about it, telling reporters that to find out what's in it, you have to vote for it, just as Nancy Pelosi did.\n\nHis budgets were much the same, hundreds and hundreds of pages of provisions not released until the last minute, so no one had time to read them. While technically public, they were no more public than flashing the contents of a phone book in front of a person's face for half a second and then calling that \"disclosure.\"\n\nAnd to think that Ryan was Mitt Romney's VP choice, picked for his conservative credentials. Now I think it is quite clear he was picked for other reasons. Do you think residents of Ryan's district are proud to have a representative who is a transitioning Republican?", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.americanthinker.com/blog/2015/06/paul_ryan_politically_transgenders_into_nancy_pelosi.html", "image": "http://www.americanthinker.com/assets/images/at-painter-og-image.png", "title": "Blog: Paul Ryan politically transgenders into Nancy Pelosi"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "At this point, very little separates Paul Ryan from Nancy Pelosi, which is why it seems clear that Ryan is bipolitically fluid.\nHe also made a gaffe in his House Rules Committee testimony on par with former Speaker Rep.
