Sixty-two percent reported that they increased premium contributions, and 40 percent increased deductibles.\n\nThirty percent increased co-pays for services such as office visits and prescription medications, and 28 increased out-of-pocket maximums that employees pay for their health care, according to survey results.\n\nThe use of wellness as a cost-containment continued to gain traction in 2013. Forty-six percent of survey respondents indicated they now have some form of wellness program, which compares to 43 percent in 2012 and 40 percent in 2010.\n\nAbout half of the wellness programs are tied to employer medical plans, and 48 percent of companies responding to the survey said they conduct annual biometric health screenings of employees, checking blood pressure, cholesterol and blood glucose levels.\n\nAn employer-sponsored family health plan in West Michigan had an average monthly premium of $1,097 in 2013, up 6.9 percent from the average monthly premium of $1,026 in 2012 and 8.9 percent from 2011\u2019s average of $1,007.\n\nThe averages are across all types of health plans \u2014 HMO, PPO and POS \u2014 and represent the premiums after employers altered benefits to mitigate higher costs.\n\nMonthly premiums for a two-person health plan averaged $883, up from $826 a year earlier. A one-person plan averaged $398 in premiums, which compares to $379 in 2012.\n\nOn average, employers responding to the annual cost survey require employees to cover 27 percent of the premium for a family plan, 28 percent for a two-person plan and 24 percent for a one-person plan.\n\nAs they\u2019ve pushed more of the cost for health coverage onto employees, employers have sought to add other benefits to make up for a perceived \u201ctake away,\u201d said Shannon Enders, a benefits consultant with Lakeshore Employee Benefits in Muskegon. Enders said he\u2019s seen an uptick in the last few years in employers adding benefits such as dental, optical or disability coverage that they can offer at a fixed cost as they switch to a lower-cost high-deductible medical plan.\n\nThe 15 percent an employer can \u201ceasily\u201d save on high-deductible health premiums typically more than covers the price to add other benefits, which helps to keep employees satisfied, Enders said.\n\n\u201cThey view you as bringing more range in \u2018what I can and can\u2019t have,\u2019\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Survey results show employers in West Michigan followed the same path in 2013 as past years to stem the ever-rising cost of health coverage.
