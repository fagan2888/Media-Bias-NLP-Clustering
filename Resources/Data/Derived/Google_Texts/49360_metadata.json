Apparently, Obama thinks differently. Our soldiers should be treated with respect and should not be subject to the downfalls of the American political system. It\u2019s very disheartening to hear that our soldiers are suffering even more than usual because our politicians can not agree on anything. The last people that should suffer is them. Again, Obama thinks differently. I wish the troops the best and hope I can make a difference in getting some entertainment back to them.\u201d\n\nBrown had a message for Obama and his administration:\n\n\u201cI would tell the president that he needs a reality check. He should go serve for a year in the Middle East and see firsthand what it is like to be there. Obviously, he has no clue and no empathy for these men and women.\u201d\n\n[poll id=\u201d116\u2033]", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.4.3", "og": {"site_name": "BizPac Review", "description": "Ultimate Fighting Championship superstar Matt \u201cThe Immortal\u201d Brown took time out from training for an upcoming battle with former interim champ Carlos Condit to offer BizPac Review a few thoughts about how U.S. troops overseas are suffering under the government shutdown.
