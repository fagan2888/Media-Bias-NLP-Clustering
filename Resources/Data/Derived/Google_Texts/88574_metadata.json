Cory Gardner is in a very close race to defeat liberal incumbent Sen. Mark Udall. Violent and chaotic conflicts continue in Ukraine, Syria and Iraq; we have a crisis along the southern border of the U.S.; our economy continues to underperform and too many people are unemployed or underemployed; and we\u2019ve got half-a-dozen unresolved scandals in Washington, especially the shame of the Veterans Administration, which have eroded Americans\u2019 confidence in their own government. But, hey, this is politics so Mark Udall wants to talk about \u2026 abortion and contraception. Those are the subjects of his latest attack ad against Cory Gardner.\n\n\n\nMissing from the ad, of course, is that Colorado women are losing access to their health care because Mark Udall cast the deciding vote for ObamaCare. Thousands have had their coverage cancelled. Many women lost their doctors and have to drive further from home or work for treatments and hospital visits.\n\n[pullquote]\n\nIf Sen. Udall\u2019s lame tactics make you shake your head, it might be best to just look away from the race for Texas Governor between Attorney General Greg Abbott (R) and State Sen. Wendy Davis (D).\n\nAbbott is well ahead of Davis in the polls and Texans broadly support his conservative agenda. As a result, Davis\u2019s rhetoric has become so shrill she has begun airing an ad that accuses Abbott of \u201csiding with a corporation over a rape victim.\u201d The ad \u2013 which I will not link to here \u2013 is a classic political attack ad with a scary voiceover and zero regard for context and legal complexity. Davis\u2019s over-the-top antics will be tough to beat. But it\u2019s only August.\n\n\n\nTactics like these are motivated by a world view that sees women as easily manipulated single issue voters. But that\u2019s not what I see as I travel the country as Chairwoman of the American Conservative Union Foundation and most recently as the Chairwoman of the Unlocking Potential (UP) Project.\n\n\n\nI founded the UP Project because everywhere I go I meet strong, intelligent women who are tired of being taken for granted and are sick of current political environment belittling them. From career women to dedicated public servants to stay-at-home moms, they are thirsty for a genuine debate about real issues impacting their lives.\n\n\n\nThe flood of bad news concerns them greatly. Women age 55 to 64 will carry the bulk of ObamaCare\u2019s premium hikes. Poverty among women is at a record high. Roughly 55.3 million women have left the workforce since the Great Recession; over a quarter million have dropped out since May alone.\n\n\n\nBut here\u2019s some good news. The Democrats\u2019 \u201cwar on women\u201d won\u2019t work this year. Those of us who demand more from our politics are organizing like never before.\n\nConservative women are going to force the nation\u2019s politicians to talk about real issues. We\u2019re going to hold Democrats to account for their failed policies. And we\u2019re going to spearhead a conservative victory in 2014.\n\n2016 Election Headquarters The latest headlines on the 2016 elections from the biggest name in politics.
