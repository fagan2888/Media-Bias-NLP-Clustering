The damage seems completely unchecked to Cramer, with only the occasional up day for Valeant providing any relief.\n\nThe problem is that Valeant won't go down without swinging, and as long as it remains on its feet, the drug group simply cannot advance for any sustained period of time.\n\nCramer considers this situation to be an unholy alliance, where there is no referee or group out there to police it to kick it out of the industry.\n\n\"Until Valeant settles, I think this bear market in pharma can't end and the money will simply continue flowing into other sectors,\" Cramer said.\n\nValeant did not immediately return CNBC calls for comment.", "article_metadata": {"AssetType": "blogpost", "description": "Jim Cramer sees a dark cloud hanging over the pharma sector, thanks to Valeant.
