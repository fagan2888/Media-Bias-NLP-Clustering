But on June 13, 2012, Rubio cast a very odd vote: he voted to save the indefensible federal sugar program.\n\nTo put it in perspective, this put Rubio on the other side from Sens. Pat Toomey, Tom Coburn, Jon Kyl, Jim DeMint, Mike Lee and Rand Paul.\n\nThe federal sugar program drives up sugar prices for American consumers and American food companies while putting U.S. taxpayers at risk, all to profit a sugar industry that is utterly dependent on big government for its existence.\n\nRubio is from Florida, which partially explains it. He's justified his support for this corporate welfare on the grounds that Brazil also subsidizes its sugar. \"If you do it unilaterally, you're going to wipe out your agricultural industry,\" Rubio has said when pressed on the topic in 2012.\n\nStay abreast of the latest developments from nation's capital and beyond with curated News Alerts from the Washington Examiner news desk and delivered to your inbox.

They kept throwing fundraisers for him throughout the campaign.\n\nThe Fanjul fundraisers stuck out, because the business lobby was generally supporting Charlie Crist in the GOP primary. Similarly, the sugar vote sticks out because Rubio generally opposes corporate welfare \u2014 he's firmly against the Export-Import Bank, and he introduced a measure to abolish Obamacare's insurance bailout known as the \"risk corridors.\"", "article_metadata": {"description": "Marco Rubio has amassed an excellent voting record in the U.S. Senate, from a conservative, libertarian perspective.
