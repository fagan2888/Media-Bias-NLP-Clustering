You may want to get out your health insurance plan and review it, especially if you're concerned about the size of your premiums, co-pays or deductibles. In the coming weeks, many Americans will get a chance to consider new options that may be better for their health and their wallets.

At J.C. Blair Memorial Hospital in Huntingdon Gail Young is gearing up for a busy few months.

A Certified Application Counselor for the Affordable Care Act, she's preparing to help residents choose their best plan.

"Even with it being the third year, it just seems like so many people even if they have their insurance they're still a little baffled by all the ins and outs," she says.

And Young's heard from many people who've found it difficult to pay their deductibles and co-pays, costs that continue to creep up.

Young says, "I have found that individuals that have enrolled in marketplace insurance themselves are learning that they made a poor choice of insurance plans."

If that's your situation, you may be able to get a better deal, when open enrollment on the healthcare marketplace, begins November 1, running until January 31, 2016.

But since not everyone qualifies for Obamacare, J. C. Blair is offering other residents a chance to find their best healthcare option.

On Tuesday, September 29 from 3 p.m. to 6 p.m. and on Wednesday September 30 from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m., the hospital will host a forum on not only the ACA, but also on the Medicaid and Medicare programs, with representatives of the Huntingdon County Medical Assistance Office and the Area Agency on Aging.

They'll clarify the differences among the programs to help you figure out which program you may qualify for.
