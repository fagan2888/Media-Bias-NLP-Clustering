So I\u2019m always interested in reading pieces about him, especially when they have a sensational-seeming headline like the one mentioned. And, while Tyson doesn\u2019t defend Scientology because he\u2019s secretly a member, what he has to say about it is somewhat worrying nonetheless.\n\nThe interviewer begins by asking Tyson his opinion on the current state of science, but then quickly pivots to Scientology because \u201cthe intergalactic story of Xenu does encroach on your territory a bit.\u201d Tyson responds cautiously, mentioning by way of comparison the \u201ccrazy\u201d Catholic belief that the Eucharist wafer is literally transformed into the body of Christ during Mass. He then elaborates:\n\n\u201cWhat matters is not who says who\u2019s crazy, what matters is we live in a free country. You can believe whatever you want, otherwise it\u2019s not a free country\u2014it\u2019s something else. If we start controlling what people think and why they think it, we have case studies where that became the norm. I don\u2019t care what the tenets are of Scientology. They don\u2019t distract me. I don\u2019t judge them, and I don\u2019t criticize them.\u201d\n\nThis response is typical of Tyson\u2019s diplomatic approach to the culture wars, like when he explained last year why he doesn\u2019t use the term \u201catheist\u201d to describe himself. \u201cHe has as much interest in meeting with other people to discuss their absence of belief in God as in meeting with non-golfers to talk about their absence of a passion for watching golf,\u201d as NPR\u2019s Tania Lombrozo explained.\n\nBut Tyson\u2019s contention that he doesn\u2019t care enough about Scientology\u2019s claims to judge or criticize them is at odds with his recent emergence from his diplomatic tortoise shell, criticizing Florida\u2019s proposed ban on using the term \u201cclimate change\u201d in government communications. Of that controversy Tyson said, \u201cNow we have a time where people are cherry picking science. The science is not political. That\u2019s like repealing gravity because you gained 10 pounds last week.\u201d\n\nBut even this attack is somewhat oblique, because he\u2019s not directly accusing the powers that be but those of us who put them in power: \u201cWe should be talking about what we are going to do about this. I don\u2019t blame the politicians for a damn thing because we vote for the politician. I blame the electorate.\u201d\n\nBut in his effort to be tactful, Tyson fails to appreciate the power of the powers that be, and that\u2019s why he should be concerned with the teachings and influence of Scientology. Educating the electorate is necessary but not sufficient for rectifying the harmful effects of ideology; education alone can\u2019t do much to influence those in power in the here and now.\n\nThe sins of fundamentalist religion are all around us, and have been since the beginning of recorded history\u2014from the Canaanite genocide by the Israelites to the Christian crusades to the rise of the Islamic State. And while Scientology doesn\u2019t have a hold on the rest of the world, and is only a small religion practiced by a minority here in America, the psychological and physical damage it inflicts on many of the individuals who get caught up in it is still real.\n\nConsider what the HBO documentary \u201cGoing Clear\u201d has exposed.
