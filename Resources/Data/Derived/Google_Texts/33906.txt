With the PGA Tour stopping in Denver this week for the BMW Championship at Cherry Hills Country Club, the Broncos are planning on hosting three of golf’s biggest stars — Rory McIlroy, Bubba Watson and Phil Mickelson — for their game Sunday night against the Indianapolis Colts.

The Broncos’ opener will be played at Sports Authority Field at Mile High, where McIlroy and Mickelson will have passes waiting.

There is no two-round cut as the BMW only invites the top 70 so McIroy, Watson and Mickelson will be around Sunday.

Wouldn’t it be something if one of them won the tourney by day and celebrated with a ceremonial wave to the Broncos’ crowd by night?

Update: The Broncos made arrangements early Monday with McIroy and Michelson. Watson was included later Monday evening.
