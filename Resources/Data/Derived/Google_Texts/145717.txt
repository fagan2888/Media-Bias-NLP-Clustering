KNOXVILLE (WATE) – Remote Area Medical is hosting another free medical clinic in Knoxville for those in need.

The event is scheduled at the Jacob Building in Chilhowee Park on February 6 and 7. Volunteers will pass out entry numbers at 3 a.m. on the first of the clinic. Entry is first come, first served. Hundreds of people started lining up early.

The goal for many is to get free medical treatment through RAM. Most can’t afford health insurance even with President Obama’s Affordable Care act.

“Places like this people need. People just can’t go with these health problems and not be able to get them addressed,” Karen Braswell of Morristown said.

Braswell is uninsured and needs dental work done. She says Gov. Haslam’s failed Insure Tennessee plan would have helped her out of the coverage gap. That’s where RAM steps in to provide free medical, dental, and vision care.

“Health care is a right wherever it is in the world, healthcare is a right. It’s like the services of the police and the fire department,” Stan Brock of Remote Area Medical said.

Brock founded the organization and has been putting together the free clinics for years. He said a couple from Knox County, Kentucky were the first to arrive. They need dental and vision care.

“If I was to have to pay $1500 to have some dental work and you don’t got it, it means a whole lot,” Howard Butler of Knox County, Kentucky, said.

The Butlers have never been to a RAM clinic before. They say without it, they would have to delay treatment they desperately need.

The gates at Chilhowee Park will open at midnight and tickets will be handed at 3 a.m. You’ll need that to enter the clinic. Organizers expect to treat around one thousand people by the end of the weekend.

People are encouraged to dress accordingly for the weather, bring regular medications and expect a long wait. Doors open on February 6 at 6 a.m. The event ends on February 7 at 2 p.m.
