Very scared,\u201d he said.\n\nBut he recovered to escape further damage and then drove in the tying run with a line single in the bottom half of the inning to push Chicago\u2019s Jackie Robinson West past Las Vegas Mountain Ridge 7-5 in the U.S. final on Saturday and into the Little League World Series title game.\n\n\u201cI thought we were just going to give them the lead,\u201d he said of his feelings after Brad Stone\u2019s two-run shot had put Las Vegas ahead 5-4. \u201cBut I thought at some point we were going to get something going.\u201d\n\nTwo walks and Houston\u2019s rocket off the glove of the second baseman in the bottom half tied it. A fielder\u2019s choice and an error made it 7-5.\n\nEd Howard then came on in relief of Houston, getting a 1-6-3 double play to end the game and send the Chicago team up against South Korea, which is seeking its third World Series title in Sunday afternoon\u2019s championship game.\n\nWhile the Chicago team celebrated on the field and posed for pictures, \u201cSaturday In The Park\u201d by Chicago fittingly played over the public address system.\n\nThere were also chants of \u201cU-S-A! U-S-A!\u201d\n\nBack in Chicago, friends, family and fans joined in the celebration, too.\n\n\u201cWe saw people dancing in the streets,\u201d said Trey Hondras, who hit a two-run homer and had two of his team\u2019s six hits while driving in three runs. \u201cI swear it looked like Michael (Jordan) was still playing back there.\u201d\n\nThe Great Lakes Region champions trailed 3-0 after the first inning and 5-4 heading into the home half of the fifth. But they came back against a Las Vegas squad which had rolled over them 13-2 on Aug. 17.\n\nThe Illinois team, called \u201cthe pride of Chicago\u201d by mayor Rahm Emmanuel, had eliminated the Taney Dragons from Philadelphia, featuring Sports Illustrated cover girl Mo\u2019ne Davis, by a 6-5 score on Thursday night in its most recent game.\n\nThe latest win was almost too much for exhausted manager Darold Butler to handle.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s still unreal,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m still going through the game in my mind, how exciting it was and how intense it was. Right now it hasn\u2019t hit me.\u201d\n\nThe Chicago team is the first member of the Urban Initiative \u2014 formed in 1999 to help local Little League programs in low-income urban neighborhoods \u2014 to make it to the LLWS since Harlem in 2002.\n\nDespite the earlier rout at the hands of the powerhouse Las Vegas team, Butler had come into the American title game confident. He said he had good reason.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the players. After losing they were ready to play that team again,\u201d Butler said. \u201cIf they could have played them the next day, they were anxious to play them again. They weren\u2019t happy with their performance and they knew they were better than that.\u201d\n\nLas Vegas manager Ashton Cave said his players were in tears after the defeat. He added that the Chicago team clearly had turned things around in the rematch.\n\n\u201cThey put the bat on the ball. They hit some tough pitches and they put them in play,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause of that, they were able to generate some runs early. When you see teams twice, there\u2019s going to be different results the second time.\u201d\n\nAlmost before many in a crowd of 27,428 at Lamade Stadium had even found their seats, Las Vegas took a 3-0 lead against Houston. Three singles loaded the bases before Houston retired two hitters, but Drew Laspaluto lashed a double off the wall in center to clear the bases.\n\nChicago came right back on Hondras\u2019 line-drive homer to right after Pierce Jones\u2019 leadoff walk. Marquis Jackson then singled and raced all the way to third on a wild pitch before scoring on Darion Radcliff\u2019s hard single.\n\nIn the second, Hondras\u2019 single to left brought in Jaheim Benton, pinch-running for Cameron Bufford, who had walked and moved up on a wild pitch by Las Vegas starter Brennan Holligan. Holligan had befuddled Chicago in the earlier meeting, but not this time.\n\nAfter Stone ripped his line-drive homer for a 5-4 Las Vegas lead, Jackie Robinson West didn\u2019t buckle.\n\nHolligan struck out the leadoff batter in the bottom half, but walked the next two hitters and was replaced by Austin Kryszczuk, who had two hits for the West champs. Houston, next up, hit a foul pop to left that was dropped. Then he tied it with a liner off the second baseman\u2019s glove.\n\n\u201cI thought I was going to be out,\u201d he said of the dropped pop-up. \u201cBut on the next pitch I tried to square it up and hit a gap.\u201d\n\nWith runners on the corners, Brandon Green\u2019s force-play grounder brought in the lead run. Then Howard\u2019s in-between hop got under Kryszczuk\u2019s glove to make it 7-5.\n\nHoward then shut the door in the sixth.\n\n\u201cWe can play baseball for Chicago, too,\u201d he said with a grin.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Great Lakes Region champions trailed 3-0 after the first inning and 5-4 heading into the home half of the fifth.
