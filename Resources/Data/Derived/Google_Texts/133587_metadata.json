His answer? Economic literacy hasn\u2019t gotten better. It\u2019s gotten worse.\n\n\u201cAt one time you had a lot of people who hadn\u2019t had any economics saying foolish things. Now you have well-known economists saying foolish things,\u201d he said.\n\nAlthough he didn\u2019t name names, New York Times columnist Paul Krugman must rank high on the list of guilty parties. There was a time, not long ago, when The New York Times called for a zero minimum wage and Krugman agreed with them. The reason? A minimum wage law isn\u2019t just a restriction on employers. It\u2019s also a restriction on workers.\n\nA $15 minimum wage, for example, means that you won\u2019t have a job if you can\u2019t produce $15 worth of goods and services in an hour. A lot of young people can\u2018t do that \u2013 especially kids that have never had a job before.\n\nThen there is a common sense point: at risk teenagers from low-income households will never learn the skills they need to be successful in the labor market if they never get a first job. As scholars at the Brookings Institution forcefully point out:\n\nFinding and keeping a job is a key step in a young person\u2019s transition to adulthood and economic self-sufficiency. Employment obviously allows young people to cover expenses for themselves and their families, but it also provides valuable opportunities for teens and young adults to apply academic skills and learn occupation-specific and broader employment skills such as teamwork, time management, and problem-solving. Additionally, it provides work experience and contacts to help in future job searches.\n\nFinally, economists almost universally understand that the minimum wage law is a lousy poverty tool:\n\n\u00b7 Only 11.3 percent of workers who earn the minimum wage live in households officially defined as poor.\n\n\u00b7 A whopping 63.2 percent of workers who earn the minimum wage are second or even third earners, living in households with incomes equal to twice the poverty line or more.\n\nFlash forward to last Saturday. In an editorial endorsing a $15-an-hour minimum wage, the editors of The New York Times repeat the canard that the typical minimum wage earner is a lone individual trying to \u201ceke out a living\u201d on that wage, ignoring all economic research to the contrary. Then, for the first time ever if memory serves, they make an economic argument for intervention:\n\nMarkets do reliably establish the prices of goods and services when businesses have to compete. When businesses compete for workers, for example, wages rise because employees gain a modicum of bargaining power. The law has long recognized, however, that low-wage workers seldom have bargaining power. An adequate federal minimum wage effectively substitutes for that lack.\n\nWow. When you walk into Walmart\u2019s, how much bargaining power do you have? Zilch. But is that bad? Not at all. If you want to bargain over price, go to a garage sale. Walmart has low prices -- not because customers have bargaining power, but because it is competing with other stores for customers.\n\nThe same thing is true in the labor market. Hourly workers almost never bargain over their wages. It\u2019s typically take it or leave it. But employers compete against other employers \u2013 on wages, benefits and other aspects of work. Competition keeps wages as high as they are, just as competition keeps Walmart\u2019s prices as low as they are.\n\nThat brings us to Paul Krugman, who repeatedly argues that small increases in the minimum wage do not cause unemployment. Economic studies and even the Congressional Budget Office disagree with him. In fact, David Brooks summarized much of the contrary evidence in a column on the very same op ed page Krugman writes for. And in the Wall Street Journal, Andrew Puzder notes that there are already indications of layoffs because of minimum swage increases in San Francisco and Seattle.\n\nKrugman does make one valid point: the market for labor is not like the market for wheat. But then he ignores all the implications of that point.\n\nIn the market for wheat, there is just wheat and a price. But in the market for labor, a lot more is involved than an hour\u2019s worth of work and a wage. Some fast food restaurants will send workers home when business is slow. A lot of employers have on-call scheduling \u2013 requiring employees to be ready for last minute shifts, but requiring them to call in an hour or so ahead of time to see if they are really needed. Some employers start paying their employees, not when they show up for work, but when the first customer arrives. Some employers have flexible hours \u2013 allowing employees to come and leave at times that best fit their family needs. Working conditions matter. We are having a serious slump in agriculture produce because farms can\u2019t attract enough workers even with a $17-an-hour wage.\n\nWhen government forces employers to pay higher wages, employers typically react by changing these other aspects of the job, including reducing other types of spending on their employees \u2013 less training and fewer fringe benefits, such as health insurance. Economist Richard McKenzie summarizes what we know about this subject:\n\n\u00b7 When the minimum wage was increased in 1967, economist Masanori Hashimoto found that workers gained 32 cents in money income but lost 41 cents per hour in training \u2014 a net loss of 9 cents an hour in full-income compensation.\n\n\u00b7 Similarly, Linda Leighton and Jacob Mincer in one study, and Belton Fleisher in another, concluded that increases in the minimum wage reduce on-the-job training and, as a result, dampen long-run growth in the real incomes of covered workers.\n\n\u00b7 Additionally, North Carolina State University economist Walter Wessels determined that a wage increase caused New York retailers to increase work demands. In most stores, fewer workers were given fewer hours to do the same work as before.\n\nOn balance it appears that employees are left worse off.\n\nEven if there were an argument for a minimum wage, there is no conceivable argument for making the minimum the same in all parts of the country. Even Krugman admits that imposing the national US minimum wage on Puerto Rico has cost jobs. Historically, the minimum wage has been set at about half the average wage in the economy. A $15 minimum in 2020 would be close to that in Washington, Seattle, Boston and New York. But it would have a much bigger impact in other parts of the country. In Miami, the average wage right now is less than $15.\n\nThere is a far more effective way of helping low income families. It\u2019s called the Earned Income Tax Credit. It\u2019s targeted (it supplements family income, but only if your income is low) and it encourages work (the more you earn, the higher your rebate). Almost all economists understand this.\n\nYet Paul Krugman recently asserted that the minimum wage makes the EITC more effective. He\u2019s wrong. The reverse is true. Combining the EITC with a minimum wage makes workers worse off \u2013 as Steve Landsburg shows, using supply and demand curves in a demonstration that any freshman in Econ 101 can follow.\n\nKrugman, by the way, is not alone. Apparently, a number of well-known economists have signed a public letter endorsing a higher minimum wage and repeating many of the myths debunked in this post.
