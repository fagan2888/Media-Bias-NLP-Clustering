It also told 363,000 people that they could lose financial aid because their incomes could not be verified.\n\nThe 115,000 people \u201cwill lose their coverage as of Sept. 30,\u201d said Andrew M. Slavitt, the No. 2 official at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which runs the federal insurance marketplace.\n\nSome of them may be able to have their coverage reinstated retroactively if they produce the documents that they were repeatedly asked to provide in recent months, Mr. Slavitt said.\n\nAt the end of May, the administration said, 966,000 people were found to have discrepancies in their immigration and citizenship records. Most sent in documents as requested. In mid-August, the administration sent letters to about 310,000 people who had failed to respond. They were supposed to submit documents by Sept. 5, but the 115,000 consumers failed to do so, Mr. Slavitt said.\n\nMany consumers and lawyers who work with them said that they had tried to submit immigration and citizenship papers, but that they experienced problems transmitting documents through HealthCare.gov. Other people said they sent the documents by mail to a federal contractor in Kentucky but never heard back from the contractor or the government.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cWe heard from lots of consumers who told us they sent in their documents multiple times or tried to upload them through HealthCare.gov,\u201d said Mara Youdelman, a lawyer at the National Health Law Program, an advocacy group for low-income people.\n\nJenny Rejeske, a health policy analyst at the National Immigration Law Center, which represents immigrants, said: \u201cIt is unduly harsh to terminate coverage while there are still technical problems with the federal system for verifying citizenship and immigration status. And there has not been adequate notice to people who speak languages other than English and Spanish.\u201d\n\nFlorida leads the list of states whose residents are losing coverage because of immigration and citizenship issues, with 35,100. Federal officials said they were ending coverage for 19,600 people in Texas, 6,300 in Georgia, 5,300 in North Carolina, 5,200 in Pennsylvania, 4,000 in Illinois and 2,400 in New Jersey. The numbers released on Monday are for 36 states using the federal insurance marketplace. They do not include terminations in California, New York and other states running their own insurance exchanges.\n\nFederal subsidies for the purchase of private insurance are a cornerstone of the Affordable Care Act. More than eight out of 10 people who selected health plans through the exchanges from October through mid-April were eligible for subsidies, including income tax credits. But in many cases, the government could not verify the incomes people reported when they applied for subsidized insurance.\n\nThis does not mean that they provided false information or were ineligible for assistance. The government tried to verify incomes by checking 2012 tax return information, but consumers may have switched jobs or received pay raises since filing those returns. As a result, officials said, the information in their applications may not match the data in federal files or in sources available to the government.\n\nMr. Slavitt said that on May 30 there were roughly 1.2 million households (and a total of 1.6 million people) with \u201cdata-matching issues.\u201d\n\nSince then, the government said, it has closed cases for 467,000 households with data discrepancies, and 430,000 cases are \u201ccurrently in the process of being resolved.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are still about 279,000 households with unresolved income-related data-matching issues that haven\u2019t sent in supporting information, representing 363,000 individuals,\u201d Mr. Slavitt said. They will soon receive letters from the government asking for proof of income, and if they do not reply by Sept. 30, they may lose some or all of their subsidies.\n\nThey would still be eligible for coverage, but in many cases could not afford it. In some cases, they would also have to repay some or all of the subsidies they received.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIt is also possible that some people could receive larger subsidies if their incomes are lower than what they expected when they applied.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20140915214555, "twitter": {"description": "The Obama administration said it would terminate health insurance for 115,000 people on Oct. 1 because they had failed to prove they were eligible for coverage.", "title": "U.S. to End Coverage Under Health Care Law for Tens of Thousands", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/16/us/us-to-end-coverage-under-health-care-law-for-tens-of-thousands.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003116869"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_150_black.png", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/16/us/us-to-end-coverage-under-health-care-law-for-tens-of-thousands.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003116869", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/16/us/us-to-end-coverage-under-health-care-law-for-tens-of-thousands.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "us", "channels": "NytNow", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/us/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "Sept. 15, 2014", "edt": "NewYork", "keywords": "Health Insurance and Managed Care,Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (2010),Illegal Immigration,Obama  Barack,Federal Aid (US),Citizenship and Naturalization", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Robert Pear", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "per": "Obama, Barack", "byl": "By ROBERT PEAR", "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "The Obama administration said it would terminate health insurance for 115,000 people on Oct. 1 because they had failed to prove they were eligible for coverage.", "tom": "News", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "description": "The Obama administration said it would terminate health insurance for 115,000 people on Oct. 1 because they had failed to prove they were eligible for coverage.", "CG": "us", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "Sept. 15, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "News", "article": {"author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/p/robert_pear/index.html", "section_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/pages/national/index.html", "section": "U.S.", "modified": "2014-09-16", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/us/index.jsonp", "tag": "Citizenship and Naturalization", "published": "2014-09-15", "section-taxonomy-id": "23FD6C8B-62D5-4CEA-A331-6C2A9A1223BE"}, "slug": "16enroll", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20140916133536, "hdl_p": "U.S. to End Coverage Under Health Care Law for Tens of Thousands", "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/16/us/us-to-end-coverage-under-health-care-law-for-tens-of-thousands.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_291_black.png", "type": "article", "description": "The Obama administration said it would terminate health insurance for 115,000 people on Oct. 1 because they had failed to prove they were eligible for coverage.", "title": "U.S. to End Coverage Under Health Care Law for Tens of Thousands"}, "pdate": 20140915, "des": "Citizenship and Naturalization", "articleid": 100000003116869, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "U.S. to End Coverage Under Health Care Law for Tens of Thousands", "PST": "News"}, "article_summary": "2 official at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which runs the federal insurance marketplace.\nFederal subsidies for the purchase of private insurance are a cornerstone of the Affordable Care Act.\nThe numbers released on Monday are for 36 states using the federal insurance marketplace.\nThe 115,000 people \u201cwill lose their coverage as of Sept. 30,\u201d said Andrew M.
