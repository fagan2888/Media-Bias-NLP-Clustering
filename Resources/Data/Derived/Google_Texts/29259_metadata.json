Embarrassed by incontinence caused by Crohn\u2019s disease, she found living out of her car a more dignified alternative to life in a public shelter. So she would park her 1992 Cadillac Eldorado outside 24-hour grocery stores or fast food joints for easy bathroom access. She spent her days wracked with worry over her next meal, her next accident, the next time her condition would inevitably drive her to Sutter General\u2019s emergency department, and whether she would need yet another surgery. Vasquez estimates she made six to eight visits to emergency rooms per year during her time on the streets.\n\n\u201cI was really ashamed, and I didn\u2019t want to be a burden on anyone, even if it was someone I grew up with,\u201d she says. \u201cI felt ashamed that I was homeless and in that condition.\u201d\n\nVasquez isn\u2019t an anomaly. Homeless and low-income individuals frequently use expensive emergency departments for issues better addressed, and potentially prevented, by primary care and behavioral health professionals. Prompted by this heavy use, outreach programs are implementing proactive strategies to break the cycle for good.\n\n\u201cThis is home to them,\u201d says Medua Odum, one of WellSpace Health\u2019s ED navigators who works with frequent users of Sutter General and Memorial emergency departments. \u201cIt\u2019s familiar, and they know they\u2019re going to get taken care of here.\u201d\n\nWellSpace Health and Sacramento Steps Forward are employing tactics that have proven successful in diverting patients like Vasquez from the emergency department and connecting them with services that will enable them to live healthier lifestyles off the streets. WellSpace Health, a federally qualified health center offering primary care, pediatric dental and integrated behavioral health services to underserved populations, has a series of programs that address unsheltered populations. Now, Sacramento Steps Forward, a local nonprofit that acts as a unifying body for service providers throughout the county, is launching its Common Cents program using strategies similar to those WellSpace has found effective.\n\nA 2002 study by the University of California San Francisco found that homeless individuals use emergency departments three times more often than the general population. Holly Harper, regional community benefits manager for Sutter Health Sacramento Sierra Region, estimates the base cost of each emergency room visit is $1,000. And with the introduction of the Affordable Care Act, emergency departments are seeing a flood of people who don\u2019t know where to go for care. The Colorado Hospital Association found that hospitals in states that expanded Medicaid under the ACA saw a 5.6 percent increase in ED visits between 2013 and 2014, compared to only 1.8 percent in nonexpansion states.\n\nVasquez\u2019s ED boomerang cycle stopped when she was referred to one of Wellspace Health\u2019s ED navigators, who are embedded in emergency departments at Sutter General and Sutter Memorial. These navigators work first with hospital staff to identify frequent users of expensive emergency department services, then meet with patients to figure out what\u2019s causing their repeated visits and help them access resources that will elevate their health and quality of life.\n\nVasquez ended up receiving a referral to WellSpace\u2019s T3 Program (Triage, Transport and Treat), which provides intensive case management. A case manager helped her access financial resources through Social Security and procure housing. WellSpace doctors helped her reduce the number of medications she was on and taught her how to change her colostomy bag. Since connecting with WellSpace, Vasquez has not had a single visit to the emergency room.\n\nSutter reports an 85 percent decrease in hospital recidivism among T3 patients like Vasquez. During the first three quarters of 2014, Sutter ED navigators connected with 263 patients, made an average of 13.5 referrals per patient to services, including primary and mental health care, insurance resources, food banks, housing and transportation, and enrolled 116 patients in their T3 program.\n\nThe best practices implemented by WellSpace are part of what is informing Sacramento Steps Forward\u2019s Common Cents Program, which will launch in January. The program seeks to reduce high-cost alternatives like emergency health care by bringing together housing and a broad array of services already available in the community.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re worried about what you\u2019re going to eat or where you\u2019re going to sleep, you\u2019re not going to prioritize your doctor\u2019s appointment or getting into substance abuse treatment.\u201d Jodi Nerell, director of behavioral health services, WellSpace Health\n\nThe reason Wellspace Health is able to make such an impact on the homeless population can be broken down into three parts:\n\nMeet Individuals Where They Are\n\nWhether it\u2019s because they\u2019ve been traumatized by a system that\u2019s broken or simply due to a lack of awareness, the unsheltered population won\u2019t always use available services. Because of the high rate at which homeless and low-income individuals use emergency departments, and given that Wellspace Health is a health center, emergency departments are a great place for employees to first make contact with those who may unnecessarily overuse the hospital\u2019s resources. For Vasquez, it was her only point of entry to the system.\n\nCommon Cents will deploy outreach workers to geographical areas found to have a high rate of mortality among the homeless population, including the central city, Oak Park and along public transportation routes.\n\nFocus on Housing First\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re worried about what you\u2019re going to eat or where you\u2019re going to sleep, you\u2019re not going to prioritize your doctor\u2019s appointment or getting into substance abuse treatment,\u201d says Jodi Nerell, director of behavioral health services at WellSpace Health.\n\nNerell says that while a small portion of the population isn\u2019t ready to come indoors, most individuals require only some sense of basic stability and safety before they are ready to unpack and investigate issues related to mental and physical health or substance abuse.\n\nED navigators offer housing information to interested patients, and T3 case managers transport them to housing intakes and help with paperwork.\n\nCommon Cents will contract with Sacramento Self Help Housing for a minimum of 20 interim housing units for people awaiting more permanent housing placement.\n\nOffering Individualized Care\n\nWhile WellSpace Health does not require individuals in its housing units to use supportive services, many resources are available onsite. At Vasquez\u2019s housing complex on Stockton Boulevard, a doctor visits twice a week. There are exam rooms, and every other Friday there are drop-offs from a food bank. Case managers go so far as to drive residents to the DMV or Social Security office, or sit in on doctor\u2019s appointments. According to Amber Salazar, who runs WellSpace\u2019s health care access and case management program, it\u2019s important that individuals are allowed to craft their own treatment plan with the support of a case manager.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s appropriate for one person may not be appropriate for another,\u201d she says. \u201cThat\u2019s key to engaging with the client and maintaining a relationship. You have to come from a very respectful place.\u201d\n\nTo meet the array of needs of all the individuals they encounter, outreach workers with Common Cents will come from a variety of backgrounds.\n\n\u201cOutreach has a lot of subpopulations,\u201d says SSF executive director Ryan Loofbourrow. \u201cFor example, we\u2019ve found that veterans respond better if it\u2019s a veteran that is the outreach worker. It\u2019s important that we\u2019re looking at who the outreach worker is and what the need is.\u201d He also plans to use existing relationships between bike cops and homeless adults, as well as Wind Youth Services, which works with homeless youth.\n\nCommon Cents will also pilot a common assessment software tool that will allow outreach workers to get people into a system accessible to all service providers. While the current tool targets chronically homeless and homeless veterans, there are plans to add assessment tools geared toward youth and families.\n\n\u201cThe idea is that through the assessment we get a list of programs they are eligible for, and whittle it down to what\u2019s available,\u201d says Michele Watts, deputy director for SSF. \u201cFrom there, it\u2019s about what the participant wants, driven by where they are located, where they want to be located, past experiences \u2014 offering them some choice from that list after the assessment is complete.\u201d\n\nVasquez calls the T3 program a godsend. January will mark three years since she moved out of her car and into housing. She\u2019s gotten her medical condition under control to the extent that she now enjoys a more active lifestyle. She has a gym membership, rides her bike and enjoys walks with her 2-year-old Chihauhua, Bubbles.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s so many good things to say about WellSpace and the case managers,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m so very thankful for this program. To me, it\u2019s been a miracle.\u201d\n\nAs Sacramento Steps Forward prepares to roll out Common Cents, for individuals struggling like Vasquez did, perhaps there is even more help on the way.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Comstock's magazine", "description": "Connecting homeless to health care saves money in the ER", "title": "Fight of the Navigators - Comstock's magazine", "url": "http://www.comstocksmag.com/longreads/fight-navigators", "image": "http://www.comstocksmag.com/sites/main/files/imagecache/medium/main-images/0115_ft_philanthropy_lead_ss.jpg", "type": "article"}, "google-site-verification": "umVpM1cBr-I5rMMhPezFzbIn0D4VT8Q78uD5_x_ctvQ", "msvalidate.01": "62E808F8EECF5694F9DD5332F07E0E03", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9fbb\"", "article_summary": "ED navigators offer housing information to interested patients, and T3 case managers transport them to housing intakes and help with paperwork.\n\u201cThis is home to them,\u201d says Medua Odum, one of WellSpace Health\u2019s ED navigators who works with frequent users of Sutter General and Memorial emergency departments.\nA 2002 study by the University of California San Francisco found that homeless individuals use emergency departments three times more often than the general population.\nWellSpace Health, a federally qualified health center offering primary care, pediatric dental and integrated behavioral health services to underserved populations, has a series of programs that address unsheltered populations.\nSince connecting with WellSpace, Vasquez has not had a single visit to the emergency room."}
