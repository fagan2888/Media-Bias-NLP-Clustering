With the help of Martin, who was a visitor to Port Canaveral they were able to remove the hooks and fishing line that were in the feet and wings of the pelican.\n\nOnce the obstructions were removed, the pelican was freed back into the wild amid cheers from citizens who watched the rescue as it took place.\n\nRelated Story:\n\nPatrick Sean Coats Wanted By Brevard County Sheriff Without the compassion and care of the wonderful visitors of Port Canaveral the Pelican would have suffered immensely and succumbed to his injuries. I would like to personally thank Martin for assisting in the rescue efforts and Karen Skurla for filming the rescue as it took place and for reaching out to us to commend the actions of Deputy Ferrante. I am always amazed at the abilities of our Deputies to stand strong as our first line of defense against criminals but even more so at their ability to shift gears and come to the rescue of an innocent creature like this in need.
