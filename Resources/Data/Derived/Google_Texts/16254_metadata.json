Its subsequent collection and analysis by law enforcement did not implicate defendant\u2019s constitutional rights.\"\n\nAt trial, Williford admitted to raping and killing Taft, but defense attorneys argued that a variety of mental disorders combined with drinking and prescription drug abuse factored into the attack and kept him from fully realizing the consequences of his actions.\n\nWake County prosecutors, who sought the death penalty, never disputed Williford\u2019s mental issues but argued that he knew what he was doing when he intentionally broke into the house and beat Taft in the head with a heavy rock.\n\nA 15-year member of the state school board, Taft lived in Greenville but was staying with her sister at 2710 Cartier Drive \u2013 the home of a longtime friend who was out of town \u2013 after having cosmetic surgery.\n\nTaft\u2019s sister found her unconscious on the morning of March 6, 2010, and called 911 thinking there had been a complication with the surgery. It wasn\u2019t until Taft was at the hospital that they realized she had been beaten and raped.\n\nShe died three days later.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30;polling-uri=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wral.com/rss/48&id=1;polling-uri2=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wral.com/rss/48&id=2;polling-uri3=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wral.com/rss/48&id=3;polling-uri4=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wral.com/rss/48&id=4;polling-uri5=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wral.com/rss/48&id=5;cycle=1", "dcterms.created": "2015-01-06 08:05:00", "description": "The North Carolina Court of Appeals on Tuesday ruled that use of a discarded cigarette butt as evidence in the trial of a man accused in the death of North Carolina State Board of Education member Kathy Taft was constitutional and that Jason Williford, convicted for Taft's murder, got a fair trial.", "application-name": "WRAL.com", "dcterms.modified": "2015-01-06 14:25:39", "outbrain": {"ob_desc": "id_asset=14331804|asset_type=story"}, "twitter": {"description": "The North Carolina Court of Appeals on Tuesday ruled that use of a discarded cigarette butt as evidence in the trial of a man accused in the death of North Carolina State Board of Education member Kathy Taft was constitutional and that Jason Williford, convicted for Taft's murder, got a fair trial.", "title": "State appeals court upholds use of cigarette butt as evidence in murder of state school board member :: WRAL.com", "url": "http://www.wral.com/state-appeals-court-upholds-use-of-cigarette-butt-as-evidence-in-murder-of-state-school-board-member/14331804/", "image": "http://wwwcache.wral.com/asset/news/local/2010/04/19/7445807/7445808-1420550409-160x120.jpg", "site": "@wral", "card": "summary"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#041E30", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "/favicons/mstile-70x70.png", "robots": "index,follow", "pinterest": "nohover", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "/favicons/mstile-310x310.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "/favicons/mstile-310x150.png", "fb": {"app_id": 334167666672300}, "author": "WRAL", "keywords": "kathy taft, jason williford, north carolina school board", "article": {"published_time": "2015-01-06T08:05:00-05:00"}, "msapplication-square150x150logo": "/favicons/mstile-150x150.png", "og": {"site_name": "WRAL.com", "description": "The North Carolina Court of Appeals on Tuesday ruled that use of a discarded cigarette butt as evidence in the trial of a man accused in the death of North Carolina State Board of Education member Kathy Taft was constitutional and that Jason Williford, convicted for Taft's murder, got a fair trial.", "title": "State appeals court upholds use of cigarette butt as evidence in murder of state school board member :: WRAL.com", "url": "http://www.wral.com/state-appeals-court-upholds-use-of-cigarette-butt-as-evidence-in-murder-of-state-school-board-member/14331804/", "image": "http://wwwcache.wral.com/asset/news/local/2010/04/19/7445807/7445808-1420550409-640x480.jpg", "type": "article"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "msapplication-TileImage": "/favicons/mstile-144x144.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca325\"", "article_summary": "\"Local law enforcement and (North Carolina State) Crime Lab scientists worked tirelessly to solve this brutal murder, with DNA evidence helping investigators zero in on the right suspect,\" North Carolina Attorney General Roy Cooper said in a statement.\n\"The defendant did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy in the parking lot, he abandoned his cigarette butt by discarding it.\nWilliford's had appealed his 2012 conviction, saying police should have obtained a search warrant before collecting the butt and using it as evidence against him.\n\"Today's ruling means law enforcement can continue to combine old-fashioned detective work with high-tech science to solve cases and achieve justice.\"\nIt wasn\u2019t until Taft was at the hospital that they realized she had been beaten and raped."}
