Partisanship may be necessary for election, but not for how you govern.\u201d\n\nStudents attending the event had the opportunity to ask questions after Zoeller\u2019s speech.\n\nZoeller answered questions on political issues such as privacy and climate change with plans based on state and citizen action rather than focusing on the federal government as a whole.\n\n\u201cIt seems to me that he always makes sure to focus on the issues that citizens think are important, rather than his personal thoughts,\u201d junior Julie Ross said. \u201cEven though I don\u2019t vote in the 9th district, I\u2019m glad I could learn about the values he stands for, because each representative in Congress directly affects all of us.\u201d\n\nZoeller encouraged students to vote in each election they could and to get involved in political campaigns they cared about.\n\n\u201cDialogue between parties and between people is important if your goal is to get any work done,\u201d Zoeller said. \u201cYou need to get that dialogue started, because there is a lot of hard work to do.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "IU's No Label's chapter invited\u00a0Zoeller to speak.", "generator": "Gryphon 20160217001 (Foundry 6.1-20150615001)", "og": {"url": "http://www.idsnews.com/article/2016/02/attorney-general-speaks-to-bipartisan-student-group", "image": "http://duvq7ua50whdw.cloudfront.net/20160412QJeR6mqyqZ/dist/img/IDS-fb-icon.png", "type": "article", "description": "IU's No Label's chapter invited\u00a0Zoeller to speak.", "title": "Attorney general speaks to bipartisan student group"}, "twitter": {"title": "Attorney general speaks to bipartisan student group", "description": "IU's No Label's chapter invited\u00a0Zoeller to speak.", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@idsnews"}, "keywords": "Indiana University, IU, Bloomington, Indiana, Monroe County, Indiana Daily Student, IDS, student newspaper, newspaper, news, students, college, university, campus, Ernie Pyle", "google-site-verification": "FkL7grEXumouo-bfJ89mrCvOGorioiCTNQ4t4X3bjjI", "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "Indiana Attorney General Greg Zoeller said when he was in college, he had no interest in politics at all.\nBut since then, he has served as a lawyer and attorney general and is now running for Congress to represent the 9th district, which includes Bloomington.\n\u201cDialogue between parties and between people is important if your goal is to get any work done,\u201d Zoeller said.\n\u201cI was elected as a Republican, but once I\u2019m in the office, I work with and serve everyone regardless of their party.\nZoeller spoke to about a dozen students from the IU chapter of No Labels, a bipartisan activist group, Thursday night about his experience in government and his goals for his Congressional campaign."}
