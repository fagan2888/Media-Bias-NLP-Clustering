According to hospital officials, the application will set forth a \u201cplan for the two hospitals to combine and operate a single hospital on Interstate Drive.\u201d\n\nIf approved, \u201cmost medical operations\u201d at URMC\u2019s McArthur Drive location would be discontinued.\n\nIn its application, URMC will seek regulatory approval to relocate to MCM\u2019s building on Interstate Drive and MCM will file a Certificate of Need to shut down its emergency room and, once combined, the facility will likely operate under a new name. A name for the facility has not been decided, according to McCormick.\n\nUnited Regional\u2019s CON filing cites the need for the two hospitals, which are located approximately 2.4 miles apart, to combine operations to \u201ccreate a stronger health care facility that can afford to invest in state-of-the-art equipment and recruit more primary care physicians to the area.\u201d The application also details a financial transaction in which the ownership groups of the two hospitals would be combined.\n\nUnited Regional Medical Center applied for and received a Certificate of Need to build a new, state-of-the-art hospital facility in late 2007 but those plans were put on hold after the economic crash of 2008 and uncertainty surrounding the Affordable Care Act. But, according to URMC\u2019s Ashoke \u201cBappa\u201d Mukherji, that CON to construct a new facility is still owned by the hospital.\n\n\u201cWe got a three-year extension for that new facility CON about two months ago,\u201d explained Mukherji. \u201cThat leaves us with options. But we feel like this combination of the two facilities is the smarter thing to do and use that momentum toward the next step.\u201d\n\nMukherji, along with Dr. Wendell McAbee, led an investor group in purchasing Coffee Medical Center from Coffee County 12 years ago and renamed it to United Regional Medical Center. The building originally opened in 1954.\n\n\u201cWhen we bought the hospital, it was always our plan to expand services and modernize the facility,\u201d said McAbee. \u201cWe were able to dramatically increase the services offered, but have been unable to do much with the physical plant itself. The planned combination is the best way to develop a first-class health care facility for the citizens of Manchester.\u201d\n\nMedical Center of Manchester president J. Stanley Rogers and his partners built MCM approximately 30 years ago.\n\n\u201cPutting these two hospitals together is long overdue,\u201d said Rogers. \u201cThis is a wonderful way to unite our medical community and bring additional services to Manchester.\u201d\n\nIf the CON is approved and plans move forward, Mukherji will oversee the integration of the two facilities.\n\n\u201cThe application is an exciting and important first step, but nothing is finalized yet,\u201d stated Mukherji. \u201cThe management teams of both hospitals have worked together to develop a strong operating plan and we hope to get a quick approval and move forward.\u201d\n\nAfter a Certificate of Need is filed, the Tennessee Health Services Development Agency will schedule a public hearing to hear debate form interested parties and the public. URMC has requested an expedited hearing. If the CON is approved, the companies would then have to file additional notices with various other governmental agencies, including Medicare.", "article_metadata": {"google-site-verification": "DSuZnC9hJQAMvp9aACU2GR1smwoMgHv-RH5LWmQ0SkM", "generator": "WordPress 4.2.2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0818\"", "article_summary": "The move would mean both hospitals will combine operations and move operations into the Medical Center of Manchester location on Interstate Drive.\nBut we feel like this combination of the two facilities is the smarter thing to do and use that momentum toward the next step.\u201dMukherji, along with Dr. Wendell McAbee, led an investor group in purchasing Coffee Medical Center from Coffee County 12 years ago and renamed it to United Regional Medical Center.\nSTAFF WRITERjosh petersonThe two hospitals in Manchester that are located less than three miles apart may soon become one, officials have announced.\n\u201cWe are really working closely together with Medical Center [of Manchester] but I want to really emphasize that these are just the beginning steps,\u201d said URMC chief executive officer Martha McCormick Monday morning.\nURMC will file an application for a Certificate of Need (CON) with the Tennessee Health Services Development Agency next month."}
