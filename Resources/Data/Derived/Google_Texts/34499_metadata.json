McCall-Hosenfeld, a primary care physician and assistant professor of medicine and public health sciences, Pennsylvania State College of Medicine.\n\n\u201cHowever, in rural settings, it might be even more important for physicians to step in, because there are few places for women experiencing IPV to turn. The physicians are in a good position to help, and may be the only option for rural women.\u201d\n\nFor the study, researchers interviewed 19 primary care physicians who provide care to rural women in central Pennsylvania. The physicians answered questions that focused on IPV screening, perceptions of IPV as a health problem, current practices for responding to identified IPV, and barriers unique to rural communities that affect care for women who have experienced IPV.\n\nOnly six of the physicians screened women for IPV, and within that group there was no standardized interval for screening, according to the study\u2019s findings. Seven of the physicians did not think routinely screening every female patient for IPV was necessary.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s appropriate unless there\u2019s something to suggest it might be happening,\u201d one physician said. \u201cWe have a lot of patients who come in and are happy, healthy, well-adjusted, and I\u2019m not going to ask those if they\u2019re getting beaten on.\u201d\n\nNearly half of the physicians acknowledged that financial dependence on the abuser was a barrier for many women who might otherwise seek help for IPV.\n\nAnd 11 percent of the physicians pointed out that patients may not even consider their family doctor as the person to go to for help.\n\n\u201cPatients often don\u2019t think of IPV as a health problem,\u201d said McCall-Hosenfeld, another barrier several physicians identified.\n\nThe United States Preventive Services Task Force now recommends IPV screening, the researchers note.\n\n\u201cIPV identification and treatment in primary care settings will also likely increase as a consequence of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, as screening and counseling for domestic violence has been added as a primary preventive service that all private health plans must cover,\u201d the researchers wrote in their study, which was published in the Journal of Interpersonal Violence.\n\nThe researchers said they believe that women suffering violence in rural areas would be helped by providing training for primary care physicians, educating the community, and improving access to referral services.\n\nFuture research should address both strategies to support the physicians\u2019 care of rural women, as well as rural women\u2019s expectations and preferences for getting help within their communities, the researchers concluded.\n\nSource: Pennsylvania State\n\nDoctor speaking with patient photo by shutterstock.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A new study shows that primary care physicians can be a critical resource for abused women in rural areas.
