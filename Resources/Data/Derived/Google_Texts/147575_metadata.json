Now, at 10 months-old, she's received some more unsettling news about her son.\n\nDoctors say he has a rare disease called Walker-Warburg syndrome. It affects development of the muscles, brain, and eyes. Blanton says there have only been 40 case studies done across the world, and doctors says Chance also has an unknown gene mutation.\n\nWhen given the choice of hospice or more surgeries, Blanton says she's choosing God. \"It's the hardest thing I have ever gone through in my life, but he is a fighter,\" Blanton said. \"And, maybe I'm in denial as they say, but I really believe that he's going to prove them wrong just like he did the first time.\"\n\nBlanton does plan to continue their current routine of weekly trips to Duke Children's Health Center and home health care visits.\n\nBlanton has set up a Facebook page updating Chance's journey. It's called \"Second Chance's.\" She's also established a Go Fund Me page to help with medical expenses.", "article_metadata": {"description": "An Onslow County mom is continuing to have faith in the recovery of her baby who was diagnosed with a rare disease.", "language": "english", "author": "Mackenzie Roberts, Elisse Ramey", "og": {"url": "http://www.witn.com/home/headlines/Onslow-County-mom-embraces-faith-as-her-baby-fights-rare-disease-368792671.html?ref=671", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/chance+blanton+baby.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "An Onslow County mom is continuing to have faith in the recovery of her baby who was diagnosed with a rare disease.", "title": "Onslow County mom embraces faith as her baby fights rare disease"}, "twitter": {"description": "An Onslow County mom is continuing to have faith in the recovery of her baby who was diagnosed with a rare disease.", "title": "Onslow County mom embraces faith as her baby fights rare disease", "url": "http://www.witn.com/home/headlines/Onslow-County-mom-embraces-faith-as-her-baby-fights-rare-disease-368792671.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/chance+blanton+baby.jpg", "creator": "@WITN", "site": "@WITN", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "keywords": "Onslow County mom embraces faith as her baby fights rare disease", "fb": {"app_id": 100653909772, "pages": 45809529741}, "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "google-site-verification": "SAIlGc4W5cz6VdYh4YTfTRgDO0fVlzEwt0FUQF1Qp3g", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Onslow County mom embraces faith, as her baby fights rare"}, "article_summary": "An Onslow County mom is continuing to have faith in the recovery of her baby who was diagnosed with a rare disease.\nWe've been following the story of Angela Blanton's baby, Chance, since last year.\nDoctors say he has a rare disease called Walker-Warburg syndrome.\nBlanton does plan to continue their current routine of weekly trips to Duke Children's Health Center and home health care visits.\nBlanton says she was told before Chance was born that he would live just a few hours."}
