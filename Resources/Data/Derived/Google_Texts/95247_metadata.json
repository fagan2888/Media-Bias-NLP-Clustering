At times, the quarterback has been fitted for a gold jacket and had his bust shipped to Canton, anointed the savior of a woebegone franchise after an eye-opening performance.\n\nAfter throwing four interceptions in the Redskins\u2019 last game \u2014 one of only two players to do so this season \u2014 Cousins vowed to improve. His performance in the 45-14 home loss to the New York Giants on Sept. 25 is not a reflection of who he is, Cousins said Thursday, but the limited opportunities he\u2019s had over three seasons don\u2019t lend themselves to forming an accurate assessment.\n\n\u201cEverybody\u2019s gonna try to write the book on who you are as a quarterback from the end of the Ravens game or the Cleveland game [in 2012], and then you may get spot duty last year,\u201d Cousins said. \u201cThat is tough, and to say, \u2018How do you deal with that?\u2019 \u2014 I don\u2019t know that I have the perfect answer.\u201d\n\nThe de facto starter while Robert Griffin III recovers from a dislocated left ankle, Cousins has played in 11 games over three seasons \u2014 including three this year, with two starts. He\u2019s played more snaps in that timeframe than many backup quarterbacks, often thriving when pressed into duty but also prone to making mistakes.\n\nThat, Cousins believes, is a byproduct of his youth \u2014 and it\u2019s why he hasn\u2019t had that much difficulty trying to stay level-headed and take a reasonable approach to each game.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m the kind of guy that would like to know my future and like to know how things are going to play out, and I don\u2019t, so I try not to ride the rollercoaster,\u201d Cousins said. \u201cI try to be as consistent as I can possibly be, and I think that approach is going to help me have success in this league. As a quarterback, you\u2019re going to have things that go your way [and] you\u2019re going to have times where it\u2019s gonna be tough, and I think the guys that last are the guys who can ride it out and stay consistent no matter what.\u201d\n\nWhen asked about the interceptions after each game, Cousins has frequently vowed that he will learn from the error so that he will not make it again. As part of his routine later in the week, Cousins will watch film of the play himself, then ask his coaches to challenge him so that he understands the reasons why the mistake was made.\n\n\u201cYou have to be brutally honest with yourself,\u201d Cousins said. \u201cYou have to check your ego at the door when you walk into the film room and say to the coaches, \u2018Let\u2019s make sure this never happens again. However you\u2019ve got to coach me, be hard on me to make sure that it gets through.\u2019\u201d\n\nCousins\u2019 next start is Monday against Seattle, which rode a transcendent defense to a victory in the Super Bowl last season. The quarterback said that while the natural tendency may be to lay off a bit so he doesn\u2019t make the same types of mistakes, it will be important for him to trust his instincts and play football.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s very young with limited starts, and that\u2019s gonna come with experience,\u201d said coach Jay Gruden. \u201cStaring down receivers is part of it that you have to learn from, and if you stare down receivers against these guys, you\u2019re gonna throw more than four picks. You\u2019re gonna throw about 11.\n\n\u201cBut that just comes with time and comes with preparation and comes with learning from your reps that you get at practice and in games and moving forward when you do make a mistake. I have confidence that Kirk\u2019s gonna bounce back from his four-pick day and do a much better job moving forward.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "After throwing four interceptions in the Redskins' last game, the quarterback vowed to improve.
