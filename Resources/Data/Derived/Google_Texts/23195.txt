AFSCME Union President Lee Saunders pledged his support to presidential candidate Hillary Clinton on Tuesday.

NILES, Ohio (WKBN) – The American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME) union president stopped in Niles Tuesday to talk to members of the local Hillary Clinton headquarters and pledge his support to the Clinton campaign.

During his speech, Lee Saunders said Clinton has stood by the union during her entire time in Washington. He said the 1 million member union overwhelmingly chose to support Clinton.

“She stands for giving work families — not only union members, but working families, whether they’re in unions or outside of unions — a shot, a shot at the American dream,” Saunders said.

Saunders also said Clinton supports collective bargaining, and she wants improve Obamacare, the union’s healthcare system.
