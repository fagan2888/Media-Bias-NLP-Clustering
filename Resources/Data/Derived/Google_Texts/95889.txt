People took advantage of free flu vaccines being offered Saturday in West Sacramento, where they were reminded that most people are much more likely to be sick from the flu than from the more attention-getting viruses like Ebola and enterovirus.



"It's a shot, it takes five minutes," said Marilyn Palmer, who was getting the shot along with her 10-year-old daughter Saturday. "And then, all year long, you're healthy."

The annual event, which was held at West Sacramento's City Hall, was also a drill for Yolo County emergency managers who regularly practice a response in case there is ever a medical emergency here on a mass scale.



"We practice actually getting a vaccine or medication into every citizen in the county and how fast we can do that," said Dana Carey, of Yolo County's Office of Emergency Services.



According to the Centers for Disease Control, more than 200,000 people, on average, are hospitalized every year from flu complications.



The CDC said 36,000 people, on average, die from the flu every year.



Dr. Yvonne Otani, a pediatrician who volunteered to help Saturday, said if a patient has had the flu vaccine, that can help a doctor quickly diagnose that person's illness.



"If you do present symptoms that are similar to enterovirus or Ebola, it may help the physician or a nurse practitioner or (physician's assistant) seeing you to know, maybe it's not influenza because you've protected yourself from that," Otani said.
