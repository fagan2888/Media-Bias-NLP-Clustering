So we\u2019re going to make up the test, and basically you take the insurance agent test, you erase the name, you write \u2018navigator test\u2019 on it.\u201d\n\nOnly a Republican would be so happy about being in a position to deny thousands of people health insurance. But that's what one insurance commissioner is, absolutely giddy about it.It's not just Hudgens. Since the administration made grants available to states to fund these navigators, the people who will help the uninsured figure out the new system, the efforts of a number of states\u2014Ohio, Missouri, Florida to name a few\u2014to interfere in this process have made news\n\nIt's now on the radar for House Republicans, too, who are \"investigating\" the program, or more to the point harassing and intimidating the organizations, mostly non-profits, which are hiring and training the navigators. The House Energy and Commerce Committee sent out a four-page letter to the organizations demanding information by September 13, and generally trying to gum up the works as these groups try to ramp up their efforts.\n\nBecause for gawd sakes, we all know that the world will come to an end if more people can get affordable health insurance. It'll be armageddon when the working poor can actually afford to see a doctor. Or get a free fucking flu shot.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Daily Kos", "description": "Ralph Hudgens\n\nOnly a Republican would be so happy about being in a position to deny thousands of people health insurance.
