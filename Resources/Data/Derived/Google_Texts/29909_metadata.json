(AP Photo/File) Obamacare\u2019s 10 essential health benefits have given brokers and agents plenty to chew on during the implementation of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. While they are intended to improve care covered under health plans across the nation, essential health benefits have been shown to drive up the cost of some plans \u2014 a side effect largely unknown to many new plan purchasers thanks to the law\u2019s subsidies \u2014 and has led to cases to coverage incongruity.
