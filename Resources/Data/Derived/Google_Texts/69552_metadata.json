The credit facility will be used to fund Univita\u2019s future growth supporting the expansion of the company\u2019s health plan partners.\n\nIn 2014, Univita added 1 million Medicaid members in Florida. Univita manages care for more than 5 million health plan members and provided over 3.2 million home health, durable medical equipment and infusion pharmacy visits in 2014.\n\n\"We are pleased to continue our longstanding relationship with Genstar Capital,\u201d said Michael Muchnicki, President and Chief Executive Officer of Univita Health. \u201cUnivita is the leader in homecare innovation. We look forward to growing and expanding with proven solutions that are changing the way patients recover and heal in the comfort of their homes.\u201d\n\n\u201cGenstar is committed to advancing Univita\u2019s mission of transforming the healthcare experience in the home with trusted and caring solutions,\u201d said Robert J. Weltman, Managing Director of Genstar Capital. \u201cToday\u2019s announcement reaffirms our commitment to Univita and paves the way for a successful continued partnership with the Univita team.\u201d\n\nUnivita specializes in the management and utilization of complex, home health services, DME and infusion pharmacy services, primarily in the government sector. Univita is contracted with more than 20 Medicare Advantage and Medicaid plans.\n\nThe home health industry is an $81.6 billion industry, with expected growth as the overall healthcare industry moves toward cost reductions in the acute setting and increased focus on less expensive care in the home.\n\nHealth expenditures are projected to grow 6.0 percent per year through 2023, according to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). The growth is largely driven by the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, faster projected economic growth and the aging of the population. Medicare spending alone is expected to rebound by 7.3 percent per year due to increased enrollment by baby boomers.\n\nUnivita\u2019s unique business model and strategic positioning in the key Medicare markets of Florida, Georgia and Tennessee are well attuned to meeting the projected growth trajectory of government health programs.\n\nGLC Advisors & Co. acted as financial advisor to Univita and Latham & Watkins provided legal counsel.\n\nAbout Univita Health\n\nUnivita is the nationwide leader in home healthcare solutions.
