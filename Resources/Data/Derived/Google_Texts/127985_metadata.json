Pope Francis said the primary reason for his visit to the United States is standing up for human life.\n\n\u201cI appreciate the unfailing commitment of the Church in America to the cause of life and that of the family, which is the primary reason for my present visit,\u201d he said at the Cathedral of St. Matthew the Apostle.\n\nWhile he spoke to the bishops, he pressed the cause of the \u201cinnocent victims\u201d of abortion.\n\nPope Francis encouraged them to remain vigilant in their opposition to abortion and he listed unborn children among those innocent people who the bishops must keep at the top of the priority list of people who deserve protection.\n\nThe pontiff lists \u201cthe innocent victim of abortion, children who die of hunger or from bombings, immigrants who drown in the search for a better tomorrow, the elderly or the sick who are considered a burden, the victims of terrorism, wars, violence and drug trafficking, the environment devastated by man\u2019s predatory relationship with nature \u2013 at stake in all of this is the gift of God, of which we are noble stewards but not masters.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is wrong, then, to look the other way or to remain silent,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cEver present within each of them is life as gift and responsibility. The future freedom and dignity of our societies depends on how we face these challenges,\u201d the Pope continued.\n\nSome pro-life advocates have hoped that Pope Francis would do more to challenge pro-abortion President Barack Obama \u2014 but a Vatican spokesman says that kind of direct confrontation should not be expected. Such a confrontation would be surprising and out of character for a Pope who has made a reputation of actions speaking louder than words.\n\n\u2018\u2018There are differences [on abortion],\u201d Ambassador Ken Hackett, the president\u2019s envoy to the Vatican, told Bloomberg Business. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s where they are going to put all their energies when they sit down one-on-one.\u201d\n\nJim Geraghty of National Review pointed to that actions-speak-louder-than-words mindset when he talked about how Pope Francis made an unscheduled stop to visit with the Little Sisters of the Poor, who have been persecuted by the Obama administration over the HS mandate compelling them to pay for abortion-causing drugs.\n\nPope Francis made an unscheduled stop to visit the Little Sisters of the Poor Wednesday, a move that Vatican officials said was intended to send a message of support in the nuns\u2019 battle against Obamacare. Keep up with the latest pro-life news and information on Twitter. Follow @LifeNewsHQ The religious order of Catholic sisters is suing the Obama administration over a provision of the Affordable Care Act that the administration has interpreted as requiring the sisters to purchase health insurance with birth control coverage. Catholic teaching opposes the use of birth control. The sisters can request a waiver, but their lawsuit argues that requiring that paperwork infringes on their religious freedom. The sisters are suing under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, a Clinton-era law that prohibits the government from placing a \u201csubstantial burden\u201d on the free exercise of religion. Last August, an appeals court sided with the government, but an unusual dissent by five judges this month called that decision \u201cclearly and gravely wrong \u2014 on an issue that has little to do with contraception and a great deal to do with religious liberty.\u201d The question now goes to the U.S. Supreme Court. Francis met with the sisters at their Washington convent next door to the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception, where he celebrated a canonization Mass for St. Junipero Serra. The private meeting was not on the pope\u2019s public schedule and was only disclosed afterward. \u201cThis is a sign, obviously, of support for them,\u201d said the Vatican Press Secretary, Rev. Federico Lombardi.\n\n\u201cAre we allowed to like this guy at all yet, or are we supposed to conclude his views on climate change make him (pun intended) irredeemable?\u201d Geraghty said. \u201cI\u2019m just surprised that so many American conservatives are acting like this is the first time they\u2019ve strongly disagreed with a pope.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is the favorite of most American Catholics and the favorite of most American Catholic conservatives. If the American Right could survive disagreements with that pope with admiration intact, there\u2019s no reason to think the relationship with this one will be perpetually sour,\u201d he added.\n\nWhile some people point to climate change as a point of disagreement with Pope Francis, pro-life Americans can surely agree that he has consistently stood up for human life with both words and deeds.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Pope Francis: Pro-Life Cause is My Primary Reason for Coming to America", "og": {"site_name": "LifeNews.com", "description": "As Pope Francis prepares to speak to members of Congress in a historic joint session today, pro-life advocates are encouraged by the words the leader of the Cat", "title": "Pope Francis: Pro-Life Cause is My Primary Reason for Coming to America", "url": "http://www.lifenews.com/2015/09/24/pope-francis-pro-life-cause-is-my-primary-reason-for-coming-to-america/", "image": "http://www.lifenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/popefrancis38.png", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 204509779594999}, "OBKey": "avejq02j7xRr+0owuq+Pcw==", "keywords": "pope francis: pro-life cause is my primary reason for coming to america", "google-site-verification": "PPPx-GD0i7nWjUFAYnFdOYorAAJLuNyKOl23JCeXyrQ", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Pope Francis said the primary reason for his visit to the United States is standing up for human life.\nWhile some people point to climate change as a point of disagreement with Pope Francis, pro-life Americans can surely agree that he has consistently stood up for human life with both words and deeds.\nPope Francis encouraged them to remain vigilant in their opposition to abortion and he listed unborn children among those innocent people who the bishops must keep at the top of the priority list of people who deserve protection.\nSome pro-life advocates have hoped that Pope Francis would do more to challenge pro-abortion President Barack Obama \u2014 but a Vatican spokesman says that kind of direct confrontation should not be expected.\nAs Pope Francis prepares to speak to members of Congress in a historic joint session today, pro-life advocates are encouraged by the words the leader of the Catholic Church imparted yesterday to the nation\u2019s Catholic bishops."}
