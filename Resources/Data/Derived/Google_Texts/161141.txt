New Jersey town council votes to rename its Kennedy Center after Obama

The Kennedy Center in Willingboro township in New Jersey will be renamed in honor of President Barack Obama after a vote by the township council.

Last Tuesday the council approved a resolution in a 3-1 vote to change the name of the center, according to the Burlington County Times. The building was formerly a high school named after Kennedy and now operates as the township’s recreation hub and senior citizen center,

“It was an easy decision,” Councilman Darvis Holley told the Times. He called Obama a president who’s “breaking many barriers nationally.”

“I think it’s a great privilege to name this community center after him,” Holley said. “…I happen to idolize Barack Obama.”

Councilman Chris Walker told the Burlington County Times it was “time to be about change.”

“I thought this would be the most opportune time to be about change and paying homage to President Obama,” Walker said because the council is also working on upgrading the current facility.

Though Willingboro voted overwhelmingly in favor of Obama in both the 2008 and 2012 elections, many of the community reactions to the proposal have been negative.

“What’s next naming malls after terrorists since he negotiates with them!!” Kristina Darlin wrote on the Burlington County Times Facebook page. She also added, “What a disgrace to merica!!”

“The only place his name should appear is in school textbooks stating he was the worst president in our history,” Lindsey Rotteau wrote. “The only CHANGE he made was making people not be proud to be an American!”
