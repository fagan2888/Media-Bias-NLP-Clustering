Some 240 students are expected to be enrolled by 2021-22.\n\nFort Worth is the largest city in Texas without an M.D. school. The University of Texas at Austin will begin accepting applications for the inaugural class of the Dell Medical School in the fall.\n\nMonday\u2019s announcement was made before an invitation only crowd that included Ed Bass, TCU Board of Trustees chairman Clarence Scharbauer, and other Fort Worth leaders.\n\nThere is an acute need for physicians brought on by the nation\u2019s aging population and the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, according to the Association of American Medical Colleges.\n\nThe group predicts that by 2025 total physician demand will increase up to 17 percent. The AAMC expects the demand for doctors to exceed the number of physicians by a range of 46,000 to 90,000.\n\nTexas ranks 5th out of the top 10 states with the lowest physician-to-resident ratios, according to data compiled by the Advisory Board Company. Only Idaho, Utah, Arkansas and Mississippi have lower ratios.\n\nIn making the announcement, officials acknowledged the growing need and the importance of curbing it.\n\n\u201cPeter Druckner, father of American business once said, \u2018The best way to predict the future is to create it\u2019,\u201d said Michael Williams, president of UNTHSC. \u201cAnd that\u2019s what we\u2019re here today to do.\u201d\n\nWhile, UT-Austin\u2019s Dell Medical relied on a mix of public and private dollars, including money from Travis County taxpayers, TCU and UNTHSC officials said this effort will be met with money from the universities and private donors.\n\nTCU has pledged $50 million from its endowment, while UNTHSC is expected to contribute $25 million to cover startup costs.\n\nThe new medical school will be the second in DFW to offer a doctor of medicine degree. It will face accreditation by multiple organizations, including the Liason Committee on Medical Education.\n\nOfficials said the cultures of the two instutitions \u2013 a health science center and a liberal arts-focused university \u2013 would create \u201cethical and principled leaders who are patient focused.\u201d\n\n\u201cBlending a medical education with liberal arts helps shape tomorrow\u2019s physicians as ethical leaders who are skilled in interpersonal communication and nimble thinkers who thrive as part of a team to treat patients in ways that consider the whole human condition,\u201d Boschini said.\n\nAccording to a press release, the school\u2019s focus will be \u201ca team-oriented educational approach that benefits patients and shapes the future practice and business of medicine.\u201d\n\nTCU and UNT have a history of collaboration.\n\n\u201cWe have a number of other health disciplines already at TCU and UNT Health Science Center. We\u2019ve been working with those other disciplines for over three years,\u201d said Susan Weeks, dean of the Harris College of Nursing. \u201cThis is a natural progression of that existing collaboration we\u2019ve had in place.\u201d\n\nThe new school will be \u201cmanaged, branded and supported jointly\u201d by both academic institutions.\n\nSome classes are expected to be offered at TCU, but the majority would be taught at UNTHSC. There are no plans for construction of any new facilities.\n\nBoth universities will select a dean, who will then report to provosts at both schools. That person would ultimately be responsible for faculty hires and curriculum development.\n\nThe new school does not yet have a name, but in the meantime it will include both TCU and UNTHSC.\n\nInitially, diplomas will only bear TCU\u2019s name \u2014 not UNTHSC. In 1993, legislation sponsored by then-state Sen. Mike Moncrief barred UNTHSC from awarding MD degrees. Williams hopes that will change in the 2017 legislative session, just in time for the medical school\u2019s first class the following year.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Chancellor Victor Boschini and officials from the University of North Texas Health Science Center announced plans for a $75 million medical school that is expected to enroll its inaugural class in 2018 with TCU grads guaranteed to make up one third of the students.
