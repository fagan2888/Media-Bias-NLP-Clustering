But the fact is that housing and recovery are joined at the hip.\n\nWithin long-term recovery, however, stable housing is necessary but not sufficient. Quality outpatient and recovery services are essential to maintaining successes achieved in what can otherwise devolve into a chronic relapsing disorder. That some corrupt providers may exist should not obscure the fact that hundreds of others offer critical community-based services that allow thousands in recovery to flourish.\n\nPETER PROVET\n\nPresident and Chief Executive\n\nOdyssey House\n\nNew York", "article_metadata": {"tone": "opinion", "ptime": 20150811032103, "twitter": {"description": "Odyssey House writes that \u201chousing and recovery are joined at the hip.\u201d", "title": "Housing for Addicts", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/11/opinion/housing-for-addicts.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003834492"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_150_black.png", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/11/opinion/housing-for-addicts.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003834492", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/11/opinion/housing-for-addicts.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "opinion", "hdl_p": "Housing for Addicts", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "Aug. 11, 2015", "edt": "NewYork", "keywords": "Drug Abuse and Traffic", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "Odyssey House writes that \u201chousing and recovery are joined at the hip.\u201d", "tom": "Letter", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "description": "Odyssey House writes that \u201chousing and recovery are joined at the hip.\u201d", "CG": "opinion", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "Aug. 11, 2015", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "Letter", "article": {"section_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/pages/opinion/index.html", "section": "Opinion", "modified": "2015-08-11", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "tag": "Drug Abuse and Traffic", "published": "2015-08-11", "section-taxonomy-id": "AD8090D7-4137-4D71-84C8-70DA3BD89778"}, "slug": "11Ldrug", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20150811032705, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/11/opinion/housing-for-addicts.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_291_black.png", "type": "article", "description": "Odyssey House writes that \u201chousing and recovery are joined at the hip.\u201d", "title": "Housing for Addicts"}, "pdate": 20150811, "des": "Drug Abuse and Traffic", "articleid": 100000003834492, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "Housing for Addicts", "col": "Letter", "PST": "Letter"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8794\"", "article_summary": "Quality outpatient and recovery services are essential to maintaining successes achieved in what can otherwise devolve into a chronic relapsing disorder.\nBut the fact is that housing and recovery are joined at the hip.\nWithin long-term recovery, however, stable housing is necessary but not sufficient.\nThat some corrupt providers may exist should not obscure the fact that hundreds of others offer critical community-based services that allow thousands in recovery to flourish.\nPETER PROVETPresident and Chief ExecutiveOdyssey HouseNew York"}
