The two appear to exchange words, and the deputy walks toward the inmate, who gets up from the chair.\n\nThe deputy then punches him in the face and kicks him when he hits the ground.\n\nA security camera recorded the incident. \u201cWhen I viewed the video, I was very disturbed by the actions of one of our officers,\u201d Wilson said Wednesday. \u201cI was disturbed by the inappropriate use of force.\u201d\n\nFord was also implicated in a 2011 choking attack on another inmate that has led to a federal lawsuit.\n\nVIDEO: Security camera video from Denver jail\n\nA second deputy, William Lewis, a 12-year department veteran, also has been placed on investigative leave for writing an inaccurate report related to the incident, Wilson said.\n\nBoth deputies are on paid leave during the investigation.\n\nIt\u2019s the latest in a string of embarrassments for the department in which deputies have been accused of using inappropriate force, colluding with inmates and even helping an inmate escape.\n\nA federal judge recently urged federal authorities to investigate practices of the Denver police and sheriff\u2019s departments in another abuse case.\n\nIn that 2011 case, former inmate Jamal Hunter is suing the city over alleged abuse by deputies and his claims that deputies overlooked abuse by fellow inmates. Ford has not been named in the lawsuit.\n\nHowever, a video that is part of the case shows Deputy Edward Keller grabbing Hunter\u2019s neck and shoving him onto a bunk inside his cell. Ford is seen holding down Hunter.\n\n\u201cThe present criminal investigation into Deputy Ford is the predictable consequence of the broken disciplinary system of the Denver Sheriff\u2019s Department,\u201d said Qusair Mohamedbhai, an attorney who represents Hunter in the lawsuit. \u201cFailure to discipline officers for using excessive force on inmates creates a culture where unlawful force is condoned and tolerated.\n\n\u201cThe rampant excessive force by Denver\u2019s law enforcement is not due to alcohol or stress, but rather leadership that is unable or unwilling to address the root cause of the problem.\u201d\n\nTom McGhee: 303-954-1671, tmcghee@denverpost.com or twitter.com/dpmcghee", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Video shows Denver sheriff\u2019s deputy punching, kicking inmate", "title": "Video shows Denver sheriff\u2019s deputy punching, kicking inmate", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/07/17/video-shows-denver-sheriffs-deputy-punching-kicking-inmate/", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140529__denver-sheriffs-attentionp1.jpg", "height": 399}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140529__denver-sheriffs-attentionp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-07-17T12:35:47+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T09:15:08+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "A jail-house video obtained by The Colorado Independent shows a Denver Sheriff\u2019s deputy who was suspended this week cold-cocking and kicking an inmate at the jail.\nThe video shows a deputy working at a copy machine as the inmate sits in a chair nearby.\n\u201cThe present criminal investigation into Deputy Ford is the predictable consequence of the broken disciplinary system of the Denver Sheriff\u2019s Department,\u201d said Qusair Mohamedbhai, an attorney who represents Hunter in the lawsuit.\nThe two appear to exchange words, and the deputy walks toward the inmate, who gets up from the chair.\nA federal judge recently urged federal authorities to investigate practices of the Denver police and sheriff\u2019s departments in another abuse case."}
