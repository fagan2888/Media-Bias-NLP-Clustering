Afghan President Ashraf Ghani on Thursday ordered a report on the probe, according to his spokesman, Ajmal Abidy.\n\nAttacks on mosques are rare in Afghanistan, even with a history of enmity between the majority Sunnis and the Shiites who make up about 15 percent of the population.\n\nSufism is considered a mystical branch of Islam in which followers seek a direct personal relationship with God. Best known for the \"whirling dervishes\" who spin in a trance, Sufism developed alongside mainstream Islam. It is widely admired for its philosophy of tolerance and forgiveness, and includes free thinkers, scientists and poets, including Rumi and Omar Khayyam.\n\nIn Afghanistan, Sufis are among the tiny communities of religious minorities that also include Ismaelis, Hindus, Sikhs and a Jew. An unknown number of Christians practice secretly, fearing persecution despite a constitutional guarantee of religious freedoms.\n\nThe shootings at the mosque, built behind a parking lot in a shabby western suburb of the capital, Kabul, took place as Pir Saheb Mohammed Bahadur Jan led the evening prayers.\n\n\"As they were kneeling for the second round of praying, men armed with small handguns fitted with silencers came in and shot everyone from behind,\" said the prayer leader's son, Abdul Waheed Bahaduri.\n\nHe was recounting the scene described to him by the sole survivor of the attack, Ahmad Zia. Bahaduri had gone home to pray because there was no electricity at the mosque. The prayer room was lit by the dull flame of a gas lamp.\n\nZia survived by hiding under the bodies of the others, said Abdul Nahim Ahmadzai, a close friend of the Bahadur family. \"He told us later that a gunman shouted in Pashto: 'No one should be left alive',\" Ahmadzai said, referring to the language of southern Afghanistan, where the Taliban originated.\n\nFollowing the attack, Bahaduri's father and older brother Shah Agha Jan, also a senior Sufi leader, were buried in fresh graves in the center of the mosque's concrete courtyard. With their deaths, the 28-year-old Bahaduri is now leader of 100,000 Sufi Muslims scattered throughout Afghanistan.\n\nSitting cross-legged on a crimson carpet, his brother's three young sons nearby, Bahaduri was incredulous that no senior government official had visited the mosque or contacted him since the attack.\n\n\"I want the president to come here and talk to us about this,\" he said. \"It was 11 people, killed in a mosque while they prayed.\"\n\nStill, in a country where everything from gender to ethnicity is politicized, Bahaduri refused to accept that the attack was politically motivated. \"We are very peaceful people. My father had followers all over the world and he welcomed people here from wherever they came from and whatever religion they were,\" he said.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Amir Shah in Kabul contributed to this story.\n\n___\n\nFollow Lynne O'Donnell on Twitter at www.twitter.com/lynnekodonnell", "article_metadata": {"description": "Killing of 11 Sufis at Afghan mosque mystifies authorities - AP News: KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) \u2014 Even in a country wracked by .05/27/2016 8:24:58AM EST.", "author": "AP News", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) \u2014 Even in a country wracked by violence for decades, the killing", "title": "AP News - Killing of 11 Sufis at Afghan mosque mystifies authorities", "url": "http://townhall.com/news/world/2015/03/12/killing-of-11-sufis-at-afghan-mosque-mystifies-authorities-n1969660", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015\\71\\6d0d9650-e140-43e1-b8ea-5ef3c12b677d.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) \u2014 Even in a country wracked by violence for decades, the killing", "title": "AP News - Killing of 11 Sufis at Afghan mosque mystifies authorities", "url": "http://townhall.com/news/world/2015/03/12/killing-of-11-sufis-at-afghan-mosque-mystifies-authorities-n1969660", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015/71/6d0d9650-e140-43e1-b8ea-5ef3c12b677d.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Killing of 11 Sufis at Afghan mosque mystifies authorities, AP News, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "Following the attack, Bahaduri's father and older brother Shah Agha Jan, also a senior Sufi leader, were buried in fresh graves in the center of the mosque's concrete courtyard.\nIn Afghanistan, Sufis are among the tiny communities of religious minorities that also include Ismaelis, Hindus, Sikhs and a Jew.\nAfghan President Ashraf Ghani on Thursday ordered a report on the probe, according to his spokesman, Ajmal Abidy.\nWith their deaths, the 28-year-old Bahaduri is now leader of 100,000 Sufi Muslims scattered throughout Afghanistan.\nSufism is considered a mystical branch of Islam in which followers seek a direct personal relationship with God."}
