The law outlines several grounds, including improper treatment or care, abuse or misappropriation of a resident\u2019s money.\n\nThe county conducted an internal investigation and also reported the incident to the Retirement Home Regulatory Authority, which issues licences.\n\nIn her report, Pauz\u00e9 said \u201cthere were no findings to substantiate that the interaction was inappropriate; however, recommendations for additional staff training were received to promote more suitable and effective communication techniques between staff and residents.\u201d\n\nThe provincial inspection on April 5 included reviewing clinical records and interviews with staff and residents. The April 22 inspector\u2019s report said there was no evidence of non-compliance with provincial standards as outlined in the Retirement Homes Act.\n\nGeorgian Residences received its licence from the RHRA in September 2013. It has 42 moderately-sized rental units. Residents can receive an array of supports tailored to meet their needs.\n\nThe county\u2019s Georgian Village development also includes Georgian Manor, which is a 143-bed long-term car facility, garden homes and life-lease suites, affordable housing and day programs, as well as a recreation centre, a restaurant and a pub.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/images/fav/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ffffff", "description": "Some harsh words from an employee at Georgian Village\u00a0sparked a Simcoe County and provincial investigation and resulted in additional\u00a0staff training", "og": {"type": "article", "image": "https://vmcdn.ca/f/files/barrietoday/gatewaysign2.jpg;w=630", "site_name": "BarrieToday.com", "description": "Some harsh words from an employee at Georgian Village\u00a0sparked a Simcoe County and provincial investigation and resulted in additional\u00a0staff training", "title": "Employee concerns sparks provincial investigation at County home"}, "twitter": {"site": "@barrietoday", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "BarrieToday.com", "fb": {"app_id": 1643980702547519}, "theme-color": "#ffffff", "msapplication-TileImage": "/images/fav/m-144x144.png", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Some harsh words from an employee at Georgian Village sparked a Simcoe County and provincial investigation and resulted in additional staff trainingSome harsh words from an employee at Georgian Village sparked a Simcoe County and provincial investigation and resulted in additional staff training.\nThe county conducted an internal investigation and also reported the incident to the Retirement Home Regulatory Authority, which issues licences.\nThe concerned staffer followed the Retirements Home Act rules that requires anyone with reasonable suspicious of harm to report those concerns.\nThe April 22 inspector\u2019s report said there was no evidence of non-compliance with provincial standards as outlined in the Retirement Homes Act.\nThe county\u2019s Georgian Village development also includes Georgian Manor, which is a 143-bed long-term car facility, garden homes and life-lease suites, affordable housing and day programs, as well as a recreation centre, a restaurant and a pub."}
