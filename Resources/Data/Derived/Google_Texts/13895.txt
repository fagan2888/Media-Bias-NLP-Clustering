Sgt. E. Brower stated that the suspect fled in a Grand Marquee and was pursued by the victim in a White SUV. The victim then proceeded to ram the suspect's vehicle several times, attempting to stop him.

An unknown pedestrian was struck by one of the vehicles but left the scene so officers did not have contact with them.

The victim lost control of the car at Central and Zoo Blvd., wrecking it. The victim and his friend got out of the car and ran down the railroad tracks. They were chased by the suspect in his car until he blew a tire and became stuck on the railroad tracks.

Everyone other than the man who was cut on the neck left the scene. The victim was then transported to a hospital to be treated for his injuries.

Police are running the license plate's on all the cars to locate the owners.
