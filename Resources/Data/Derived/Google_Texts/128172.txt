In the summer of our discontent — a summer marked by gay marriage, the battle flag, Obamacare, trade deals, immigration — Mark Levin delivers a fabulous broadside against the Left and an out-of-control government.

Levin’s sixth book is a “fire bell in the night” to our nation, especially its young people, about the attack on liberty and prosperity and the coming crisis, manufactured by a Leviathan-like government, that threatens to swallow future generations.

The power of Levin’s book is in his taking virtually every major problem facing the country — the debt, entitlements, open immigration, radical environmentalism, education, minimum wage, national security, the Constitution, and others — and compellingly laying out the case against big government and the Left while building the case for the individual and conservatism. He then clearly lays out solutions that the entire country, including young people, should be able to rally around.

In Plunder and Deceit, Levin is unrelenting in his barrage of facts, history, and logic as he eviscerates an out-of-control government. He also explains how the federal Leviathan is destroying the nation, with calamitous consequences for future generations. The book is embargoed until its August release and we anticipate it will be a breakaway bestseller. As with his other bestsellers, Levin’s scholarship is impeccable and his intellect is as sharp as ever. And as always, his passion for freedom is evident throughout the book.
