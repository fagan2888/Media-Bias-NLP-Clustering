That is because Apple will no longer have the ability bypass the passwords of individual users. (The policy also applies to iPads running the company\u2019s IOS 8 software.)\n\n\n\nApple\u2019s new policy change comes months after the Supreme Court unanimously ruled that law enforcement agencies must obtain a warrant before they can search phones, except in rare circumstances. In that ruling, the court said the individuals\u2019 Fourth Amendment right to privacy ranks higher than the needs of the police. (The editorial board wrote favorably about that ruling.)\n\nTaken together, the new Apple policy and the high court\u2019s decision mean that law enforcement agents will no longer be able to get around a user\u2019s passcode by getting the information directly from Apple. Some might argue that this could make it harder for law enforcement agencies to investigate crimes because many individuals would refuse to give up their codes under their Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination.\n\nBut law enforcement agencies have always needed to work around uncooperative suspects. In the physical world, they can kick down the door of a house if they have a warrant to search it and the resident won\u2019t let them in. In the case of a locked phone, government investigators with a warrant from a judge could use software to hack the device. Thieves have already figured out ways to unlock iPhones; police with warrants can do the same.", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20140919101323, "BN": "takingnote", "dfp-ad-unit-path": "takingnote", "adxPage": "blog.nytimes.com/takingnote/post", "DISPLAYDATE": "September 19, 2014", "org": "Apple Inc", "keywords": "Fourth Amendment (US Constitution),Search and Seizure,Apple Inc,Uncategorized", "communityAssetTaxonomy": "blogs/takingnote/Apple Versus Cops ( 20140919 )", "description": "The company won\u2019t provide information such as photos, messages and calling histories stored on the phones of its customers to law enforcement agencies.", "PT": "Blogs", "author": "Vikas Bajaj", "SCG": "takingnote", "sourceApp": "blogs", "CLMST": "Vikas Bajaj", "byl": "Vikas Bajaj", "twitter": {"description": "The company won\u2019t provide information such as photos, messages and calling histories stored on the phones of its customers to law enforcement agencies.", "creator": "@vikasbajaj", "url": "http://takingnote.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/09/19/apple-versus-cops/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "title": "Apple Versus Cops", "card": "summary"}, "blogpostid": 100000003125467, "news_keywords": "4th Amendment,Search and seizure", "robots": "noodp", "dat": "September 19, 2014", "article": {"tag": "Uncategorized", "published_time": 1411136003, "collection": "http://json8.nytimes.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "modified_time": "2014-09-19T17:37:27-04:00", "author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/b/vikas_bajaj/index.html"}, "ticker": "Apple Inc|AAPL|NASDAQ", "utime": 20140919173727, "communityAssetLabels": "NYT_Blogs", "PUD": 20140919, "pdate": 20140919, "des": "Fourth Amendment (US Constitution);Search and Seizure", "thumbnail": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "og": {"site_name": "Taking Note", "description": "The company won\u2019t provide information such as photos, messages and calling histories stored on the phones of its customers to law enforcement agencies.", "title": "Apple Versus Cops", "url": "http://takingnote.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/09/19/apple-versus-cops/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/blogs_v5/../icons/t_logo_291_black.png", "type": "article"}, "communityAssetURL": "http://takingnote.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/09/19/apple-versus-cops/", "PUV": "normal", "hdl": "Apple Versus Cops", "thumbnail_150": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "PST": "Blog Post"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcdab5\"", "article_summary": "But law enforcement agencies have always needed to work around uncooperative suspects.\nThe company says it will no longer be able to provide information such as photos, messages and calling histories stored on the phones of its customers to law enforcement agencies.\nSome might argue that this could make it harder for law enforcement agencies to investigate crimes because many individuals would refuse to give up their codes under their Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination.\nApple\u2019s new policy change comes months after the Supreme Court unanimously ruled that law enforcement agencies must obtain a warrant before they can search phones, except in rare circumstances.\nThat is because Apple will no longer have the ability bypass the passwords of individual users."}
