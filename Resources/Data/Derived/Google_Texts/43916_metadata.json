Violation of the latter requirement could cost the district $1.5 million in penalty.\n\nAmanda Alexander, the district\u2019s human resource manager, reviewed the two compliance issues during a meeting with board members on Thursday.\n\nThe news brought mixed reactions from school officials and board members who said the district must address the issue as soon as possible.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to have to start monitoring this \u2026 cutting back on these hours,\u201d school director Eddie Hickman said. \u201cIf not, we\u2019re rolling the dice.\u201d\n\nBoard member Tommy Dudley described the health reform law as \u201ccrap forced on us by the federal government,\u201d and expresed concerns that compliance makes it look like the district is punishing substitute teachers.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want the substitutes to think we don\u2019t appreciate what they do,\u201d Dudley said.\n\nUnder the Affordable Care Act employees who work 30 or more hours per week or 130 hours per month average will be eligible for health care coverage. The district currently have 298 substitute teachers on the payroll who do not receive single cover insurance.\n\nUnder current coverage rates, health insurance would cost $585.71 per month for each substitute teacher or more than $2 million a year.\n\nAlexander said during October the district used 193 substitute teachers of which 103 worked more than 30 hours. The cost of providing health insurance for those teachers would have cost the county about $723,000 that month, she said.\n\nAny substitute teacher working 30 hours or more as of Jan. 1, 2015 must receive health care benefits for one year, Alexander said.\n\nShe said her department is looking into purchasing some computer software to help track the hours of substitute teachers at a cost of about $22,000.\n\n\u201cThe cost for implementation and administration of these type systems is far less than the cost to cover health insurance premiums for substitute teachers,\u201d she said.\n\nUnder the Affordable Care Act, the school district also will be required to provide equal coverage to all employees. Since the district pays 45 percent of the dependent coverage premium for all licensed employees, the district now will be required to pay the same toward the same coverage of classified employees.\n\nThe district currently employs 631 classified employees and if 50 percent enrolled in family coverage, the district\u2019s share of the insurance coverage would increase to more than $1.5 million. If 100 percent of the classified staff enrolled, the district\u2019s cost would climb to more than $3.1 million, Alexander said.\n\nThe district could be levied a $1.5 million \u201cDiscrimination Penalty\u201d for non-compliance, she said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Maury County school officials plan to limit substitute teachers to a 28-hour work week to avoid paying health insurance required under the Affordable Care Act \u2014 a move that will save the district from spending an estimated $2 million per year.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "VANESSA CURRY vcurry@c-dh.net", "og": {"site_name": "Columbia Daily Herald", "description": "Maury County school officials plan to limit substitute teachers to a 28-hour work week to avoid paying health insurance required under the Affordable Care Act \u2014 a move that will save the district from spending an estimated $2 million per year.", "title": "School district to limit substitute teachers' hours", "url": "http://columbiadailyherald.com/news/local-news/school-district-limit-substitute-teachers-hours", "image": "http://columbiadailyherald.com/sites/columbiadailyherald.com/files/field/media/web1_Dudley%2C-Tommy-boxed.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://columbiadailyherald.com/news/local-news/school-district-limit-substitute-teachers-hours", "title": "School district to limit substitute teachers' hours", "card": "summary", "creator": "@thedailyherald"}, "al": {"web": {"should_fallback": "true"}, "android": {"url": "columbiadailyherald://?eid=703114", "app_name": "columbiadailyherald", "package": "com.stephensmedia.columbiadailyherald"}, "ios": {"url": "columbiadailyherald://?eid=703114", "app_store_id": 964773799, "app_name": "columbiadailyherald"}}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=964773799", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.stephensmedia.columbiadailyherald", "keywords": "Local News,Local News,", "article": {"published_time": "2013-11-18T19:34:36-06:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=0.9"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb55c\"", "article_summary": "Alexander said during October the district used 193 substitute teachers of which 103 worked more than 30 hours.\nThe district currently have 298 substitute teachers on the payroll who do not receive single cover insurance.\nShe said her department is looking into purchasing some computer software to help track the hours of substitute teachers at a cost of about $22,000.\n\u201cThe cost for implementation and administration of these type systems is far less than the cost to cover health insurance premiums for substitute teachers,\u201d she said.\nThe cost of providing health insurance for those teachers would have cost the county about $723,000 that month, she said."}
