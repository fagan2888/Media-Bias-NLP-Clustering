Not surprising, but the more troublesome figure is that 25 percent of these increases are in the double digits.\n\nTo state the obvious, businesses need an alternative to address the increasing costs and restrictive participation requirements that make traditional group health insurance out of reach for most small businesses.\n\nA commonsense solution is to reimburse employees for their individual health insurance. Employees have already purchased an individual health plan, they like their coverage, and an employer contribution would be greatly valued.\n\nBut\u2026\n\nSomebody you respect - your CPA, your weekend golf buddy, or an acquaintance in your professional network - has advised you against giving employees money for their individual insurance.\n\n\u201cYour business will be fined up to $36,500... per employee!\u201d they say.\n\nThat figure is no chump change. It\u2019s a large sum of money for any business, let alone a business unable or unwilling to take the financial plunge into traditional group insurance.\n\nThe purpose of this article is to provide perspective on this $36,500 figure, and to provide more information on the reality of the fee than what has been published to date.\n\nThe Core Issue\n\nThe core issue is really a financial issue with roots that stretch far deeper than an IRS excise tax - it\u2019s about questioning the status quo of traditional group health insurance. A status quo that has dominated the health insurance industry since World War II. We\u2019re talking giant sequoia tree roots in Redwood National Park, not the sapling maple tree you just bought from Home Depot and stuck in your front yard.\n\nIt\u2019s likely, almost certain, that we will look back at this article soon and find the thought of employer fines for helping employees with health insurance to be ludicrous (no need to look backward for me).\n\nBut before we get there, let\u2019s dive into this seemingly daunting $36,500 figure a bit deeper.\n\nGroup Health Plans Aren\u2019t New...and Neither is the Tax\n\nThe term \u201cgroup health plan\u201d is broad; it includes many types of employer-provided benefit plans such as traditional group health insurance, self-insured plans, and any other plan that provides medical care for participants or their dependents either directly through insurance or reimbursement.\n\nMost private sector group health plans are covered by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA). Among other things, ERISA provides protections for participants and beneficiaries in employee benefit plans, including providing access to plan information. Also, individuals who manage these plans must meet certain standards of conduct and plan requirements. Many of these requirements are documented under 26 U.S. Code Chapter 100. A failure to meet these requirements could lead to excise tax penalties that could be assessed according to \u201c26 U.S. Code \u00a7 4980D - Failure to meet certain group health plan requirements\u201d.\n\nAn employer\u2019s plan to provide employees money for individual health insurance (whether taxable or tax-free) is considered a group health plan. Since that plan is a group health plan, it must meet the requirements of Chapter 100. If it doesn\u2019t, the plan could be subject to penalties upon audit.\n\nCode 4980D isn\u2019t new - it was there before the Affordable Care Act (ACA) - and employers providing these types of group health plans (money toward individual insurance and/or out of pocket medical expenses) had to comply then. These employer plans have to comply now. Was anybody in the industry talking about the $36,500 penalty before ACA? Of course not. It didn\u2019t make headlines because employers weren\u2019t being fined. Were they being audited? Odds say yes. Were there noncompliant plans audited pre-ACA? Odds say almost undoubtedly yes. Were there fines levied on businesses for these audited noncompliant plans? Not that I\u2019m aware of.\n\nSo, why the big deal now?\n\nBecause we\u2019re in a time of change. The ACA added new requirements to Chapter 100, sometimes called the \u201cMarket Reforms,\u201d that are covered in detail here. These requirements were effective for all plans beginning January 1, 2014 or later.\n\n$36,500... The Reality\n\nSo, let\u2019s say you\u2019re a business owner that gives or reimburses 10 employees $304/month for their individual insurance (we\u2019re making our math easy later). In order to receive the money, employees are required to provide proof of insurance coverage - like an invoice or billing statement. For purposes of our example, all this can be done formally or informally, although it should be noted that informal reimbursement/payment of employees\u2019 individual insurance coverage isn\u2019t recommended.\n\nThis example company, whether intentional or not, offers a group health plan to its employees. Is the business at risk of being fined $36,500 per employee? Maybe.\n\nLet\u2019s take a minute to go through the \u201cwhat-if\u2019s\u201d:\n\nYour plan is audited - There are approximately 30 million small businesses in the U.S. and yours could certainly be one of the handful selected for audit by the Department of Labor (DOL). ACA reporting and new compliance requirements have resulted in far greater DOL scrutiny of ERISA plans than in years past. Your plan is found to be out of compliance - A plan could be noncompliant for a variety of reasons: requirements related to portability and access, standards relating to benefits for mothers and newborns, and now these pesky \u201cMarket Reforms.\u201d So let\u2019s say it was out of compliance for some reason. The compliance failure was due to reasonable cause and/or your company/plan didn\u2019t exercise willful neglect - Basically, you weren\u2019t trying to intentionally circumvent the law and were exercising reasonable diligence. One law dictionary\u2019s definition of reasonable diligence:\n\nA fair, proper, and due degree of care and activity, measured with reference to the particular circumstances; such diligence, care, or attention as might be expected from a man of ordinary prudence and activity.\n\nYou\u2019re granted a correction period and don\u2019t correct the error within 30-days - There\u2019s a 30-day correction period that starts from the time the person liable for the tax was made aware of the failure. But let\u2019s say you choose to not adhere to the warnings and don\u2019t fix your plan.\n\nSo to recap, your company plan was audited, was found to be out of compliance, you acted reasonably, you did not exercise willful neglect, and you decided not to fix the error within 30-days of the notice of failure (we\u2019re way deep in the theoretical here). You\u2019d be forking over $365,000 ($36,500 multiplied by 10 employees) to Uncle Sam, right? Probably not.\n\nReady for another caveat? Under our theoretical example, the company\u2019s actual excise tax would be equivalent to the lesser of:\n\nTen (10) percent of the aggregate amount paid by the employer during the preceding taxable year for the plan, or $500,000\n\nI\u2019m not making this up. Our example company would self-report an excise tax of $3,650 ( [10 employees x $304/employee/month x 12 months] x 10%). Yes, one less zero than our scary friend $36,500.\n\nLet\u2019s be clear. If your plan failure was not due to reasonable cause or your company/plan exercised willful neglect, you could be subject to the daunting $36,500 excise tax.\n\nBut let\u2019s also be realistic. The \u201climitations on amount of tax\u201d in 4980D exist for a reason. Businesses aren\u2019t, under most circumstances, helping their employees with individual insurance and willfully neglecting plan requirements. Most businesses are doing everything in their power to remain compliant and follow the rules.\n\nBusinesses that find themselves here should know there are compliant plans that allow an employer to reimburse employees for individual health insurance (preventive care coverage is required also, to satisfy one of those Market Reforms). For example, a Healthcare Reimbursement Plan (HRP) is designed specifically to meet the requirements of the Market Reforms will stand up to an audit.\n\n\n\nReal vs. Perceived Risk\n\nArticle after article has been written, many by reputable authors, about the $36,500 fine small businesses could face for performing individual health insurance reimbursement/payment out of compliance. This is a huge perceived risk to a small business with a tight budget.\n\nWhat hasn\u2019t been written about, however, is the real risk. If a small business is audited, and if their plan is found to be out of compliance, it\u2019s likely no fine would be levied at all (due to the 30-day grace period for businesses that weren\u2019t operating out of willful neglect). Even if the grace period were disregarded, the actual fine would likely only be a fraction of the $36,500 per employee advertisement.\n\nAdditionally, small business owners who want to minimize their risk (what business owner doesn\u2019t?) can simply adopt a plan that will avoid the fees altogether, such as an HRP.\n\nWhat questions do you have about reimbursing employees for individual health insurance and the $36,500 excise tax?
