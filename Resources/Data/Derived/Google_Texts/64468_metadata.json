The researchers who collected the data noted that their results should dispel social conservatives\u2019 fears that the risk of pregnancy is \u201cthe only thing standing between women and promiscuity.\u201d\n\nThe study is part of the ongoing Contraceptive CHOICE project, a research initiative at the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis that has been tracking nearly 10,000 low-income women of reproductive age for several years. The women participating in the project received an FDA-approved contraceptive of their choice at no additional cost to them.\n\nIn 2012, the researchers confirmed that this policy \u2014 which simulates the Obamacare provision that extends birth control coverage without a co-pay \u2014 effectively helped lower these women\u2019s rates of unintended pregnancy and abortion. Then, the researchers conducted a follow-up investigation into other aspects of the participants\u2019 sexual behavior, surveying them about their number of sexual partners and the frequency of sexual intercourse during the year after they received their free birth control.\n\nMost of the women did report that they were having sex more frequently \u2014 but they were doing it safely. The majority of participants, 70 percent, reported that there was no difference in the number of their sexual partners. The women who did report an increase were most likely to have gone from zero sexual activity to a sole sexual partner. There also weren\u2019t any increased rates of sexually transmitted infections among the group that got no-cost contraception.\n\n\u201cIncreasing access to no-cost contraceptives doesn\u2019t translate into riskier sexual behavior,\u201d Jeffrey Peipert, the study\u2019s senior author, explained. \u201cIt\u2019s not the contraception that drives their sexual behavior.\u201d\n\nIndeed, even among the women who indicated that they wanted to start using birth control specifically so they could become sexually active, more than 45 percent had not actually started having sex after a year of using contraception.\n\nThe new research paper directly refutes arguments from groups like the right-wing Family Research Council, which argues that it\u2019s important to restrict access to contraception to dissuade teens from having sex. Nonetheless, the debate over Obamacare\u2019s birth control provision has largely centered on this myth about female sexuality. Particularly after Sandra Fluke testified in favor of the policy, conservatives were quick to bash her for being a \u201cslut\u201d who wanted the government to finance her promiscuous sex life. Two years later, Republican lawmakers are still repeating this line of reasoning.\n\nThanks to deeply ingrained societal attitudes toward women \u2014 who are expected to remain pure, and who are often punished for displaying their sexuality \u2014 this attitude extends to other areas of sexual health, too. Many Americans are uncomfortable with the HPV vaccine, effective long-lasting forms of birth control, and comprehensive sex education because they believe these resources could somehow encourage girls to become sexually active.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "A large new study dispels the conservative argument against Obamacare's contraceptive coverage.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "A large new study dispels the conservative argument against Obamacare's contraceptive coverage.", "title": "No, Free Birth Control Doesn\u2019t Encourage Women To Have Risky Sex", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/health/2014/03/07/3375301/birth-control-risky-sex/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/birth-control.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A large new study dispels the conservative argument against Obamacare's contraceptive coverage.", "creator": "@Tara_CR", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/birth-control-321x214.jpg", "title": "No, Free Birth Control Doesn\u2019t Encourage Women To Have Risky Sex", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-health", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/birth-control.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/birth-control.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2014-03-07T09:02:28+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/tculpressler"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fceac5\"", "article_summary": "Health No, Free Birth Control Doesn\u2019t Encourage Women To Have Risky Sex CREDIT: ShutterstockProviding women with access to no-cost contraception doesn\u2019t spur them to make riskier sexual choices, according to a large study published in the Obstetrics & Gynecology journal this week.\nNonetheless, the debate over Obamacare\u2019s birth control provision has largely centered on this myth about female sexuality.\nMost of the women did report that they were having sex more frequently \u2014 but they were doing it safely.\nMany Americans are uncomfortable with the HPV vaccine, effective long-lasting forms of birth control, and comprehensive sex education because they believe these resources could somehow encourage girls to become sexually active.\nIn 2012, the researchers confirmed that this policy \u2014 which simulates the Obamacare provision that extends birth control coverage without a co-pay \u2014 effectively helped lower these women\u2019s rates of unintended pregnancy and abortion."}
