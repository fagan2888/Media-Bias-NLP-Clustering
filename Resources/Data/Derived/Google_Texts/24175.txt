Kirk has introduced the Medicare Common Access Card Act, which would redesign Medicare cards so that a senior’s Social Security number is no longer displayed. He said the new cards would use smart technology similar to identification cards currently used by military service members.

“With their social security numbers prominently displayed on the front of their Medicare cards, Illinois seniors are at a high risk of becoming a victim of identity fraud,” Kirk said on Monday. “I want our seniors to have the same level of identification security as our servicemen and women.”

Kirk said Medicare fraud costs the federal government at least $60 million a year.

His bill would place a chip inside Medicare cards that would store seniors’ personal information electronically.
