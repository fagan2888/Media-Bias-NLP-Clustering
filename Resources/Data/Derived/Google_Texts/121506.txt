STEAMBOAT SPRINGS, Colo. (AP) — Officials in Steamboat Springs are struggling to find money to make sure the historic Howelsen Hill ski area remains open, along with its iconic ski jumping complex and training ground for winter athletes.

City officials are concerned about costly repair bills, caused by small landslides.

Recommendations to raise more money include a lift ticket tax, or creation of a parks and recreation district that could levy taxes
