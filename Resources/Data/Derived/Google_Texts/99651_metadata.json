Boehner had barred GOP committee chairmen, including House Oversight Chairman Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah), from investigating Clinton\u2019s email setup for fear of muddying the waters around the ongoing Benghazi Committee probe.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nBut with Benghazi Chairman Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.) vowing that he won\u2019t expand his probe to include Clinton\u2019s server \u2014 and with Boehner out the door \u2014 some Republicans say the time has come to take direct aim at the former secretary of state\u2019s server setup.\n\n\u201cI just think it needs to happen. \u2026 We already know [Clinton] messed up,\u201d said Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), a member of the Benghazi and Oversight committees who remains skeptical of Clinton because a handful of her emails have surfaced from other sources, even though Republicans asked for all her Libya-related correspondence from the State Department. \u201cIt seems to me we have to do everything we can to ensure we know if [she turned over everything]. \u2026 Whether that should be on the Benghazi Committee or the Oversight Committee or the Foreign Affairs Committee \u2014 that\u2019s up to them.\u201d\n\nThe office of House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) said it did not have any updates on the matter at this point. But other Republicans say it would be best to leave the issue to the Justice Department, which has the 2016 Democratic contender\u2019s server and is investigating whether classified information was ever mishandled. Still, the FBI has not called its probe a formal investigation, while suggesting it is interested in broader questions about how classified materials were handled \u2014 and not necessarily launching a criminal inquiry.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s best served by law enforcement,\u201d said Rep. Peter Roskam of Illinois, another Republican on the Benghazi panel. \u201cI would not recommend a separate investigation of any kind.\u201d\n\nRep. Mark Meadows, an Oversight subcommittee chairman from North Carolina, said that\u2019s the impression he\u2019s gotten about where things are headed in the House: \u201cI think the general opinion is that we defer to the FBI because they have an investigation.\u201d\n\nThe divide represents the delicate balance Republicans are trying to strike. Some Republicans hope to hold Clinton\u2019s feet to the fire on an issue they say shows poor judgment \u2014 but they\u2019re wary of being labeled as partisan hacks who are just trying to derail her campaign. Democrats have spent weeks battering Republicans on the Benghazi panel, which they deride as a partisan exercise aimed at hurting Clinton in the polls. But, at the same time, conservatives on the right are grilling the GOP for not pressing hard enough.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like we haven\u2019t closed the loop. \u2026 We\u2019re not going to be any harder on Hillary Clinton because she\u2019s running for president \u2014 but we\u2019re not going to be easier either,\u201d Chaffetz told POLITICO when asked about his efforts to start a separate investigation in August.\n\nOn Tuesday, Chaffetz did not comment specifically on the calls for a new probe into Clinton\u2019s email setup. A source familiar with his thinking said he\u2019s still interested in probing the matter, but the decision on whether to do so is still up in the air as members interested in taking up the probe seek leadership\u2019s permission and gauge what their colleagues think.\n\nMeanwhile, many House Republicans are cool to the idea. Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (R-Fla.), who sits on the House Intelligence and Foreign Affairs panels, for example, pooh-poohed any effort to launch a separate probe: \u201cPeople are kinda a little sour on all these special investigations.\u201d\n\nAnd even former Oversight Chairman Darrell Issa, who was one of the most aggressive wielders of the Oversight gavel in recent history, was reserved when asked about the possibility of a new probe. The California Republican said the public already knows about Clinton\u2019s activities and highlighting them now, before an election, wouldn\u2019t do much good. Issa said it\u2019s \u201ca good question for the new speaker.\u201d\n\n\u201cShould Clinton be accountable for her wrongdoing? Yes, but that\u2019s mostly up to the Justice Department now,\u201d Issa added. \u201cIf we do more, what have we really accomplished? \u2026 If we go after it, it looks exactly like what it would be: further trying to pull out things that are right now in the political arena.\u201d\n\nTwo Senate chairmen, Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) on Homeland Security and Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) on Judiciary, are continuing their own probe of the Clinton server\u2019s security issue, although they\u2019re working behind closed doors for now. They\u2019ve reached out to the tech companies Clinton employed to learn more about how Clinton\u2019s server was protected \u2014 and who approved it, knew about it or possibly tried to object to it.\n\nSome in the House have found a separate but related angle they\u2019re interested in pursuing: Earlier this year, the Benghazi panel turned up about 15 Libya-related emails between Clinton and her ally Sidney Blumenthal that she had never turned over but which the committee discovered though a subpoena. The panel had asked Clinton to hand over all her Libya messages, so the emergence of these previously unknown emails, which Republicans considered Libya-related, piqued their interest.\n\nAnd while Clinton\u2019s campaign told the media she didn\u2019t start using her private email setup until March 2009 \u2014 seeking to explain why there was an email gap in her record from the first few months she was in office \u2014 an inspector general this fall discovered a January 2009 exchange from her private account that she had with former commander of U.S. Central Command David Petraeus.\n\n\u201cThose stories keep changing,\u201d Jordan said. \u201cWith that as the context, I think it makes sense to ask\u201d questions about these things.\n\nBenghazi Republicans at the tail end of their marathon hearing in late October tried to grill Clinton on the matter. But she deflected specific questions \u2014 including how her legal team sorted private correspondence that needed to be turned over from personal email \u2014 referring back to her lawyers.\n\nHer team has noted that federal records experts determined more than 1,200 messages she turned in were personal and returned \u2014 proof, they say, that she went above and beyond.\n\nBut some federal records experts say that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean she was overly inclusive \u2014 just that it raises questions about whether the person who went through her emails knew what was required to be turned over under law and what wasn\u2019t.\n\nRep. Lynn Westmoreland (R-Ga.) said there are also several unanswered questions surrounding exactly when State realized Clinton had a private email server and when Clinton\u2019s lawyers knew that they\u2019d eventually have to turn over these messages.\n\nClinton said in her hearing that she found out in October 2014, but Republicans say they\u2019ve seen evidence suggesting that her lawyers knew much earlier that there was an issue.\n\nThose, Westmoreland said, are good questions for another panel: \u201cThere\u2019s nothing else we can really do about her using a personal server from the Benghazi committee. \u2026 Our mission is to find out what led to us being in Benghazi, why there was not better protection there \u2026 but not to go in and do the kind of research that would need to be done about why\u201d she used a server.\n\n\u201cIt would be up to someone else \u2026 to take that up,\u201d he said. \u201cTo me that would be another committee, Oversight or \u2026 Foreign Affairs.\u201d\n\n", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "Some firebrands want to dig deeper on the Democratic front-runner's unusual server setup, but others would rather take a pass.", "title": "House GOP split over Clinton email probe", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/11/hillary-clinton-emails-republicans-server-congress-215498", "image": "http://static.politico.com/b5/b8/ff83f6004ebdb71c46a7ffccd192/151103-gowdy-gty-2-1160.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/rachael.bade.9"}, "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "Some firebrands want to dig deeper on the Democratic front-runner's unusual server setup, but others would rather take a pass.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Boehner had barred GOP committee chairmen, including House Oversight Chairman Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah), from investigating Clinton\u2019s email setup for fear of muddying the waters around the ongoing Benghazi Committee probe.\nOn Tuesday, Chaffetz did not comment specifically on the calls for a new probe into Clinton\u2019s email setup.\nBenghazi Republicans at the tail end of their marathon hearing in late October tried to grill Clinton on the matter.\nMeanwhile, many House Republicans are cool to the idea.\nThose, Westmoreland said, are good questions for another panel: \u201cThere\u2019s nothing else we can really do about her using a personal server from the Benghazi committee."}
