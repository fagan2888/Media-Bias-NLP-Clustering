Check out the nifty Advent calendar MSNBC made to celebrate the coutdown to Obamacare enrollment:

I suppose we already knew Chris Matthews thinks Mr. Obama is “a messiah,” so it’s only fitting that his colleagues make an Advent calendar for him.

You know, Advent: “When the Church … makes present this ancient expectancy of the Messiah, for by sharing in the long preparation for the Savior’s first coming, the faithful renew their ardent desire for his second coming. By celebrating the precursor’s birth and martyrdom, the Church unites herself to his desire: ‘He must increase, but I must decrease.'”

Or, “When [MSNBC] makes present this [modern] expectancy of [Obamacare], for by sharing in the long preparation for the [Obamacare’s] first coming, the faithful renew their ardent desire for his second coming. By celebrating the [Mr. Obama]’s birth and [election, MSNBC] unites herself to his desire: ‘He must increase, but I must decrease.'”
