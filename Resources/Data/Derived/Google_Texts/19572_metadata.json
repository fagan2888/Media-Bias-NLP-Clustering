But if you ask a biologist, you\u2019ll hear that stress can be good.\n\nIn fact, it\u2019s essential.\n\nBut people who responded to NPR\u2019s poll talked mostly about the downside of stress.\n\nFor example, the adrenal glands of all animals have evolved to pump out stress hormones in unexpected situations \u2014 the hormones spur action and increase fuel to the brain, helping the animal react to danger appropriately. Those hormones also flow to memory centers in the brain, to help the critter remember those notable moments and places.\n\n\u201cIf it turns out to be dangerous and if the animal actually turns out to survive danger, then it will be aware of this as a potentially dangerous place,\u201d explains Bruce McEwen, head of the neuroendocrinology laboratory at The Rockefeller University. \u201cIn that sense, stress is good.\u201d\n\nPeople also experience this good kind of stress. It\u2019s your body\u2019s reaction as you get pumped up to speak in public, for example, or compete in an athletic event.\n\n\u201cWe do something that takes a little bit of a risk and has a good outcome, we feel exhilarated \u2014 that\u2019s good stress,\u201d McEwen says.\n\nOf course, that\u2019s not what most people were thinking of when pollsters called them earlier this year. NPR conducted a poll that focused on stress in America, with the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the Harvard School of Public Health.\n\nThose responding talked mostly about the downside of stress \u2014 the sort that comes from tension at work or family friction. The biological mechanisms that help us in the short run, it turns out, aren\u2019t so useful when the stress grinds on for weeks or months.\n\nMcEwen, who wrote The End of Stress As We Know It, says often people find ways to tolerate that stress. But it can also be overwhelming, \u201cand then, we have something that\u2019s been called toxic stress,\u201d he says.\n\nThe stress system gone awry can literally make you sick.\n\n\u201cWhen stress is sustained or repeating or extreme, then all [the usual systems] get disrupted,\u201d says Huda Akil, co-director of the Molecular and Behavioral Neuroscience Institute at the University of Michigan. \u201cAnd eventually, you do it long enough and it starts impacting other systems \u2026 immune responses; it can affect the heart; it affects brain cells. It depends how long we\u2019re talking about.\u201d\n\nIn our poll, many Americans responding said that to cope with excessive stress they end up eating more or sleeping more. Yet others said they end up sleeping less and eating less. Sometimes these reactions can help reduce stress, research shows \u2014 but other times not.\n\nDavid Linden, a professor of neuroscience at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and author of The Compass of Pleasure, has been thinking about the source of all this stress.\n\n\u201cI think a lot of people imagine that our modern lifestyle \u2014 with constantly chirping cellphones and email and all these demands \u2014 has led to more stress,\u201d Linden says. \u201cAnd the truth is, it really doesn\u2019t seem to be that way.\u201d\n\nThink how stressful it must have been for our forebears, who lived in constant worry that their children would die of infectious diseases (still a constant threat in some parts of the world).\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like stress is mounting up in our modern age \u2014 it\u2019s just [that] the flavor of it is changing,\u201d Linden says.\n\nAnd that flavor isn\u2019t changing as much as you might think. Our poll finds that over the past year, the major causes of stress in Americans are still those age-old troubles: illness, disease and the death of a loved one.\n\nNow, 14 percent of the people we polled said they didn\u2019t feel stressed at all. But that doesn\u2019t mean a few people have found a secret Eden right here on Earth.\n\nHuda Akil says some people are simply more tolerant of stress than others. She sees this clearly in her animal studies.\n\n\u201cSome animals like risky situations, actually go seek them, and other animals cower away from them,\u201d Akil says. \u201cAnd it\u2019s clearly genetic. We can breed for it. And it shows up very, very early in life. And it is in humans what we define often as temperament.\u201d\n\nThat temperament is shaped by both biology and our experiences as young children. It can have a lifelong impact on how we perceive stress and cope with it. The good news is this mix of psychology and biochemistry is malleable.\n\n\u201cA lot of stress can be very disruptive,\u201d Akil says. \u201cBut a little bit of stress is kind of like working your muscles, your emotional muscles. And you build them up and you learn how to cope. So this is not something that\u2019s irretrievably wired to be bad or good. It can be retuned and fine-tuned, and it\u2019s never too late.\u201d\n\nStress is, at root, a mechanism for adapting to changing circumstances. So when a challenging situation inevitably appears, the trick is to get the stress reaction to work to your advantage.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Do something that takes a little risk, with a good outcome, \"We feel exhilarated; that's good stress.\"", "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"Like Other Animals, We Need Stress -- in Moderation\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/2014\\/07\\/10\\/like-other-animals-we-need-stress-in-moderation\\/\",\"pub_date\":\"2014-07-10 11:51:58\",\"mod_date\":\"2014-07-14 15:48:11\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":20117,\"author_id\":\"8344\",\"author_name\":\"State of Health\",\"author_display_name\":\"State of Health\",\"tags\":[\"Science\"],\"categories\":[\"Living Healthy\"],\"image\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/sites\\/27\\/2014\\/07\\/480197193crop.jpg\"}", "og": {"site_name": "State of Health", "description": "Do something that takes a little risk, with a good outcome, \"We feel exhilarated; that's good stress.\"", "title": "Like Other Animals, We Need Stress \u2014 in Moderation", "url": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/2014/07/10/like-other-animals-we-need-stress-in-moderation/", "image": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/wp-content/uploads/sites/27/2014/07/480197193crop-640x428.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@kqedhealth", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@"}, "fb": {"app_id": 160023622793}, "keywords": "science", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca809\"", "article_summary": "\u201cWe do something that takes a little bit of a risk and has a good outcome, we feel exhilarated \u2014 that\u2019s good stress,\u201d McEwen says.\nLike Other Animals, We Need Stress \u2014 in ModerationBy Richard Harris, NPRAsk somebody about stress, and you\u2019re likely to hear an outpouring about all the bad things that cause it \u2014 and the bad things that result.\n\u201cIn that sense, stress is good.\u201dPeople also experience this good kind of stress.\n\u201cI think a lot of people imagine that our modern lifestyle \u2014 with constantly chirping cellphones and email and all these demands \u2014 has led to more stress,\u201d Linden says.\nMcEwen, who wrote The End of Stress As We Know It, says often people find ways to tolerate that stress."}
