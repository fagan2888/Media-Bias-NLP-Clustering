For example, Sixty-three percent of the 100 Best Hospitals had a five-star rating -- statistically representing a much lower mortality rate -- for the treatment of heart attack compared to only 12 percent for all other hospitals.\n\nSimilarly, 60 percent of hospitals on the list had a five-star rating for the treatment of stroke compared to 13 percent for all other hospitals; 80 percent had a five-star rating for the treatment of pneumonia (14 percent for all others); and 46 percent had a five-star rating for the treatment of COPD compared (6 percent for the rest).\n\n[Also: How many hospitals earned a Leapfrog and Healthgrades safety award? 142, that's all]\n\nDuring the study period from 2012 to 2014, the 50 and 100 Best Hospitals showed strong performance in clinical outcomes for Medicare patients across at least 21 of 32 of the most common inpatient conditions and procedures. The performance was measured by objective performance data, such as risk-adjusted mortality and in-hospital complications.\n\nHere is the full list of winners, searchable by name, city and state:\n\n\n\nName City State Rank Name City State Rank Baner Estrella Medical Center Phoenix Arizona Top 100 Dignity Health- Chandler Regional Medical Center Chandler Arizona Top 100 Mayo Clinic Hospital Phoenix Arizona Top 50 Cedars -
