Federal officials may soon make surface mining off-limits on portions of East Tennessee's scenic mountain ridges.

Environmental groups have long decried the practice of mountain-top mining in the Appalachians. The process involves using explosives to blast mountain tops, exposing underlying coal deposits, a less-expensive and labor-intensive method than underground mining. The resulting rock and soil debris is dumped into valleys at the foot of mountains.

In 2010, then-Governor Phil Bredesen petitioned the federal government to ban the practice in certain areas in eastern Tennessee. It is a proposal that has the support of the current administration.

“This will protect the specific high-elevation ridgelines and conserve the mountains on these public lands in a manner that not only will protect existing natural habitat, but also the viewsheds, vistas and recreation opportunities that support local tourism,” said Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation Commissioner Bob Martineau. “We welcome the public comment that will come in the next phase of this process.”

A draft proposal by the federal Department of the Interior would end the practice in 67,000 acres in the North Cumberland Wildlife Management Area. The department has set a Jan. 25 deadline to receive public comment about the proposal, which can be seen here.
