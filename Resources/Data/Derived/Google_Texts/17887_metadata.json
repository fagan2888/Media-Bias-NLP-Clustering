Affordable health care is worse than a law that lets slave owners get their runaway slaves back.\u201d\n\nPrescribed: An Interactive Tour of What Obamacare Means for You\n\n\u201cI mean, these are quotes,\u201d he added. \u201cI\u2019m not making this stuff up.\u201d\n\nIndeed, he wasn\u2019t. The man who charged Mr. Obama with creating a health-care system akin to slavery was Bill O\u2019Brien, a representative in New Hampshire\u2019s state legislature and former speaker of the House. In August, Mr. O\u2019Brien spoke at an Americans for Prosperity rally in New Hampshire and likened the Affordable Care Act to an 1850 pro-slavery federal law.\n\n\u201cWhat is Obamacare?\u201d Mr. O\u2019Brien said his remarks. \u201cIt is a law as destructive to personal and individual liberty as the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 that allowed slave owners to come to New Hampshire and seize African Americans and use the federal courts to take them back to federal \u2026 to slave states.\u201d\n\n\u201cBarack Obama and our allies fooled us long enough to pass a law that is clearly among the worst ever enacted by Congress,\u201d added Mr. O\u2019Brien, who is backed by the tea party and recently said he was cancelling plans to enter the race for a U.S. House seat after taking a job at software company. (A clip of the remarks can be found on Youtube, posted by GraniteStateProgress, a progressive advocacy group in New Hampshire. The Concord, N.H. Patch site has posted its own version as well.)\n\nMr. O\u2019Brien, in an interview with The Wall Street Journal following Mr. Obama\u2019s speech, stood by his words and said he had made a \u201cfair comparison.\u201d\n\n\u201cEach of [the laws] was an assault by the federal government on the freedom of individuals and the rights of states to make choices on how to approach such individual rights,\u201d he said. \u201cThe federal government with the Fugitive Slave Act enacted something that was repugnant to individual liberty. So, too, the federal government enacted Obamacare, and this direct order to individuals to buy a service was repugnant to the division of responsibilities that the Founding Fathers so carefully put together in our Constitution.\u201d\n\nHe added that if Mr. Obama tried to understand the opposition\u2019s point of view, he would \u201cengage in a lot less demagoguery.\u201d\n\nIn his speech, Mr. Obama said Republicans warning of Obamacare\u2019s consequences are painting a picture of Armageddon. \u201cAll this would be funny if it wasn\u2019t so crazy,\u201d he said.\n\nMore\n\nGOP Eyes a New Fiscal Prize With Health-Law Push\n\nMore Resources", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "In a speech defending his health-care law, President Obama ran through a list of Obamacare critics\u2019 claims, including one comparing it to the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850.
