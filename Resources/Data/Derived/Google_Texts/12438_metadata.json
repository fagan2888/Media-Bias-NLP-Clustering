They found out they were about to lose their new health insurance.\n\n\u201cClara was listening to the news on Iowa Public Radio and that\u2019s how we found out,\u201d Fairchild says. They went to their health plan\u2019s website that night. \u201cNo information. We still haven\u2019t gotten a letter about it from them.\u201d\n\nThe two are the sole employees of a cleaning service and work nights. Fairchild has chronic leukemia but treats it with expensive medicine. Last year they saved hundreds of dollars switching from the insurer Wellmark to a plan run by CoOportunity Health. For the first time in a long time, Fairchild says, they felt like they had room to breathe.\n\n\u201cBasically it covered our office visits; covered exams,\u201d he says. \u201cIt covered all but $40 of the medicine every four weeks. It was just marvelous. It probably was too good to be true.\u201d\n\nIt was for them.\n\nCoOportunity Health has failed. The Affordable Care Act set aside funding for health care co-ops, to enable the organizations to compete in places where there aren\u2019t many insurers. CoOportunity Health was the second largest co-op in the country in terms of membership, and one of the largest in terms of the federal funding it received.\n\nBut then CoOportunity hit a kind of perfect storm, says Peter Damiano, director of the University of Iowa\u2019s public policy center. First, the co-op had to pay a lot more medical bills than those in charge expected.\n\n\u201cCoOportunity Health\u2019s pool of people was larger than expected, was sicker than expected,\u201d Damiano says. \u201cSo their risk became much greater than the funds that were available,\u201d\n\nThe reason the co-op\u2019s customers were sicker has a lot to do with what the insurance market looked like in Iowa before Obamacare. The largest insurer by far in the state was and still is Wellmark. But Wellmark decided not to offer any plans on Iowa\u2019s health exchange, leaving just CoOportunity and one other insurer \u2014 Coventry \u2014 offering plans on the exchange throughout the state.\n\nOn top of that, when the Obama administration in late 2013 allowed people to keep the insurance plan they already had, many customers happy with Wellmark stayed put. Damiano says this meant many of the customers who flocked to CoOportunity tended to be like Fairchild \u2014 people with expensive health problems who\u2019d had trouble paying for insurance before, in the market Wellmark dominated.\n\n\u201cIt was always going to be a challenging market to try to reach,\u201d says Damiano, \u201cand on top of that, the whole idea of co-ops was relatively new and experimental. But it was to try to create competition, on that private sector approach,\u201d says Damiano.\n\nNot only were the patients sicker, but CoOportunity\u2019s leaders initially thought they would enroll about 12,000 people in Iowa and Nebraska. They got about ten times that, according to Nick Gerhart, Iowa\u2019s insurance commissioner.\n\nAlso, Gerhart says, the co-op thought it was going to get more federal money.\n\n\u201cOn December 16 around 4 o\u2019clock we were informed they weren\u2019t going to get any further funding,\u201d he says. \u201cNothing was pulled \u2014 it just wasn\u2019t extended further.\u201d\n\nGerhart is now essentially the CEO of the co-op because the state has taken it over. He likens the situation to a small business suddenly having its credit shut off by the bank. Even though CoOportunity is not officially dead yet, Gerhart is telling its customers to switch insurers.\n\nHe says it\u2019s too early to make predictions about the fate for all co-ops.\n\n\u201cOurs was the second largest in the country, so you\u2019ve got to look at it that way.\u201d Gerhart says. \u201cIf the second largest can\u2019t make it, how viable are the other ones? I don\u2019t know. But at the end of the day they didn\u2019t have enough capital to support 120,000 members.\u201d\n\nIn a written statement, Dr. Martin Hickey, chairman of the board of the National Alliance of State Health Co-Ops, said, \u201cThe news about CoOportunity Health is not a statement on the health insurance co-op program or the co-op concept. It\u2019s a reflection on the fact that all insurers \u2014 not just co-ops \u2014 are operating in unique markets with unique business plans and varying state regulations. The circumstances for CoOportunity Health in Iowa are not the same as those in the 23 other states in which co-ops are currently operating.\u201d\n\nBut the co-op\u2019s failure in Iowa has left David Fairchild and Clara Peterson scratching their heads.\n\n\u201cI mean the whole Affordable Care Act is [about] competition between insurance companies, and now we\u2019re back down to what?\u201d says Peterson.\n\nFor them, only one option: Coventry. They\u2019ve already applied through healthcare.gov and now they\u2019re now waiting for approval for a plan that will cover a lot less of Fairchild\u2019s medicine expenses.\n\nOriginally appeared in Kaiser Health News.", "article_metadata": {"description": "It was a heck of a Christmas for David Fairchild and his wife, Clara Peterson.
