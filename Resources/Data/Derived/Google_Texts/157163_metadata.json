Sweets is a flailing drug dealer who finds himself in the middle of a turf war in London\u2019s Soho in 1958.\n\nThe action takes place in a dank rock\u2019n\u2019roll club. When bits of the owner are found in two bins, a battle breaks out between his psychotic son Baby (Ben Whishaw) and the ambitious club manager Mickey (Brendan Coyle from \u201cDownton Abbey\u201d).\n\nSweets and his fast-talking friend Potts (an amusingly hyperactive Daniel Mays) get caught in the crossfire, and their puffed-up gangster swagger soon turns to quivering jelly. Grint does a particularly good line in bug-eyed sweaty panic.\n\nThe plot flags a bit in Act 2, and the bloody denouement lacks a crucial cornerstone of motivation.\n\nWhishaw\u2019s performance is powerful compensation. He\u2019s gentle one moment, sadistic the next, and creates terror with a smile. It travels at the speed of a bullet in Ian Rickson\u2019s well-choreographed production. Rating: ****.\n\nPerfect Nonsense\n\nThere\u2019s comedy of a different sort in \u201cPerfect Nonsense,\u201d based on the Jeeves and Wooster stories of P.G. Wodehouse.\n\nStephen Mangan stars as Bertie Wooster, a well-meaning toff who gets tangled in a knot of theft schemes, complicated courtships, and terrifying uncles.\n\nThe other roles are taken by Matthew Macfadyen and Mark Hadfield, and the costume changes and role doublings are handled with expert silliness. (Macfadyen simultaneously plays a pert niece and her spluttering mustachioed guardian at one point.)\n\nJeeves, Bertie\u2019s famously capable \u201cgentleman\u2019s gentleman,\u201d creates the set and scenery -- including a stage revolve -- to help his master tell the story.\n\nThe only quibble is that the character of Jeeves gets a bit lost in the role-doubling mayhem. He\u2019s just one of Macfadyen\u2019s many parts in the show, and not quite the linchpin he might be.\n\nIt\u2019s still as fluffy and precarious as a souffle, and the gags come thick and fast. Rating: ****.\n\nAngry Man\n\nThe clever jury-room drama \u201cTwelve Angry Men,\u201d based on Reginald Rose\u2019s 1957 screenplay, comes to the Garrick Theatre.\n\nMartin Shaw plays a juror who believes there may be reasonable doubt about the guilt of a young black man on trial for murdering his father. The other jurors, all white males, are against him, and he fights his corner by picking up on details that the lawyers have missed.\n\nShaw holds it all together with good-guy tenaciousness, and there\u2019s great support from Jeff Fahey (\u201cLost\u201d) as his chief antagonist with a hair-trigger temper.\n\nRobert Vaughn (\u201cThe Man From U.N.C.L.E.\u201d) suffers heartrending memory losses and has to read many of his lines from sheets of paper. It pulls focus terribly, even when the others stay in character to prompt and help him.\n\nChristopher Haydon\u2019s production is a traditional affair, with the virtues of good old-fashioned stagecraft. Rating: ****.\n\n\u201cMojo\u201d is at the Harold Pinter Theatre.
