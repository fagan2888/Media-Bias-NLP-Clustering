The number has increased by nearly 13 percent over the last three years.\n\nMany of these individuals are homeless because of trauma\u2013the loss of a job or loved one, or abuse, or wartime horrors, said Lisa Falcone, director of homeless outreach for the Mental Health Association.\n\nThe high cost of rental housing in Morris County makes it hard for them to find a safe environment for recovery; their financial straits ruin their credit, making it even harder to land an apartment.\n\n\u201cBefore, a lot of private landlords wouldn\u2019t do credit checks. Now, it\u2019s rare that one doesn\u2019t,\u201d said Ana Ribeiro, senior care manager for the association.\n\nAnd so, pockets of people are living behind supermarkets, and in the woods, according to the association.\n\nFULL CIRCLE\n\nFor Debra, the trauma was unemployment, compounded by serious health problems. She lost her apartment, and wound up sleeping on friends\u2019 couches after the trucking company where she spent 13 years as an administrative assistant went belly-up in 2010.\n\nShe had come full circle.\n\n\u201cI was born homeless,\u201d said Debra, nicknamed \u201cFire Baby\u201d because her family\u2019s Western Avenue house in Morristown burned down in 1964 while she was being delivered at the hospital.\n\nApproaching 50, she never expected to find herself in the same situation.\n\nBut her health has been declining for a decade since being diagnosed with ailments including fibromyalgia, a debilitating neuro-muscular disorder. The stress of losing her job exacerbated her physical problems, she said.\n\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you go to the Mental Health Association?\u201d a special friend suggested last year.\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018No, I\u2019m not crazy!\u2019 Debra recounted. \u201cI didn\u2019t know they could help me with anxiety and depression.\u201d\n\nShe attended Project Homeless Connect last December.\n\n\u201cThey said, \u2018Don\u2019t worry, we\u2019ll help you, and everything will be okay.\u2019 They never let me down. It was one day at a time.\u201d\n\nA year later, thanks to that visit and the referrals that flowed from it, Debra has received psychiatric treatment for anxiety, financial assistance, and food stamps.\n\nAnd she scored a housing voucher, too, good for lodging in northern Morris County with her cat, Kiss Kiss.\n\nThe Fire Baby returned to Project Homeless Connect on Thursday with a grateful message:\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t give up. Don\u2019t quit. Don\u2019t be afraid to ask for the help.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"robots": "noodp,noydir", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe20e9\"", "article_summary": "The Fire Baby returned to Project Homeless Connect on Thursday with a grateful message:\u201cDon\u2019t give up.\nAlthough Morris County is among the nation\u2019s wealthiest counties, some 346 homeless people\u2013including 88 children\u2013were counted here in a January survey.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know they could help me with anxiety and depression.\u201dShe attended Project Homeless Connect last December.\nAnd she scored a housing voucher, too, good for lodging in northern Morris County with her cat, Kiss Kiss.\n\u201cI want people to know that there is hope,\u201d Debra said Thursday at Project Homeless Connect, a day-long clearinghouse for social services held at St. Peter\u2019s Episcopal Church in Morristown and coordinated by the Mental Health Association of Morris County."}
