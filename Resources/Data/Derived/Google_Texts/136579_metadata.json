If you\u2019re a conservative, you pick the driver of a very unpopular even, the government shutdown, as your next presidential pick because you enjoy losing badly.\n\nFirst term Senator Ted Cruz Cruz won the first spot in the Values Voter Summit straw poll at 25%, with Dr. Ben Carson coming in next with just 5% difference at 20%. Former Governor Mike Huckabee came up third and Senator Rick Santorum won fourth place.\n\nLast year, Cruz beat Carson by a much wider margin with 42% on the heels of shutting down the government.\n\nYes, shutting down the government is what the conservative base likes. They want senators who don\u2019t do their jobs, but instead make things worse for the average American \u2014 anything to spite President Obama.\n\nConservatives polled said the most important issue to them was \u201creligious liberty\u201d. This notion got Republicans very excited on Twitter, after they convinced themselves that they could win the White House on it because it\u2019s HUGE. Everyone cares about \u201creligious liberty\u201d.\n\nThe problem for the Republican Party is that their definition of \u201creligious liberty\u201d is very exclusionary and thus the opposite of the idea of \u201creligious liberty\u201d. Republicans fight for liberty for Christians, while demonizing other religions, especially their misinformed ideas of Muslims.\n\nLiberty sounds all exciting and Ted Cruz delivered a bit of a sermon at the Value Voters Summit, so it seems like a perfect match. But Cruz delivered more of a heady brew of persecution and delusion, culminating in him announcing that when Republicans take back the White House in 2017, they will repeal every word of Obamacare. \u201cIn 2017, with a Republican president in office, we\u2019re going to sign legislation repealing every word of Obamacare.\u201d Brace yourselves for the smarm, \u201cWeeping may endure for a night but joy cometh in the morning.\u201d\n\nOh yes, because \u201cjoy\u201d is defined as not being able to afford healthcare insurance for your dying or sick family members. Oh, \u201cJOY\u201d. Meet \u201cLIBERTY\u201d!\n\nThis, of course, would fly in the face of Republicans\u2019 current beliefs regarding what is an acceptable use of executive power, but also, no. They will never repeal every word of Obamacare because just like Social Security, people need it and want it. In two more years, it will be even more popular and Republicans will have to offer an alternative if they want to destroy it.\n\nTed Cruz said he had a plan, but in truth, Barack Obama used the conservative plan. Barack Obama used the market based plan based on competition between private companies that was the conservative approach to the healthcare problem. Republicans objected because they didn\u2019t want a win for Obama, but now they are left fighting the battle of fools \u2014 fighting against their only idea, with no alternative. Joy sure will come in the morning.\n\nLuckily for Republicans, their base is easily manipulated about what \u201cissues\u201d they are supposed to care about, hence they care most about something that is not an issue. Religious liberty? The biggest religion in this country is Christianity and it\u2019s not being threatened. The President is a Christian. No one is coming for Christians, no matter how persecuted they like to pretend they are.\n\nBut hey, being persecuted pays well for Cruz, Palin, et al. The idea that they are being persecuted is romantic and it isolates the base \u2014 if everyone else is out to get you, they can\u2019t be trusted. The only people the base can trust are the people they are sending their money to and voting for. Well played.\n\nIf Cruz wants the big love from the base, he\u2019s going to need to make a big gesture of destroying the country in a way he can pretend is hurting Obama and not the people. Of course, none of this hurts Obama \u2014 it only hurts the very people voting for Cruz. JOY, I tell you. JOY and LIBERTY.", "article_metadata": {"description": "How do you say winning?
