ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) — Algeria’s three-week presidential campaign kicked off Sunday with the incumbent president and his chief rival both promising to make this oil-rich nation more democratic by amending the constitution.

President Abdelaziz Bouteflika, who will be running for his fourth five-year term, will be largely sitting out the campaign and relying on deputies to present his case after a stroke last year left the 77-year-old in a wheelchair with trouble speaking.

While six candidates are running for the powerful presidency in the April 17 elections, Bouteflika is the overwhelming favorite with the power of the state behind him. Many political parties are boycotting the contest, calling the election a farce.

The president’s campaign manager, Abdelmalek Sellal, opened the campaign with a speech in the far south, near the border with Mali, reiterating a promise to make the nation more democratic by reforming the constitution.
