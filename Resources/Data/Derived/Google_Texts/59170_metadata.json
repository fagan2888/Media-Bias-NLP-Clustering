From the interview:\n\nG:\u2026If you accelerate certain things but aren\u2019t careful about whether you want to make those innovations available to everyone, then you\u2019re intensifying the cost in such a way that you\u2019ll overwhelm all the resources. RS: Like million-dollar chemotherapy treatments. G: Yeah, or organ transplants for people in their seventies from new artificial organs being grown. There is a lot of medical technology for which, unless you can make judgments about who should buy it, you will have to invade other government functions to find the money. Joint replacement is another example. There are four or five of these innovations down the pipe that are huge, huge things. RS: Yeah, but when people start talking about these issues, we start hearing loaded phrases like \u201cdeath panels\u201d and suggestions that government bureaucrats are going to decide when it\u2019s time to pull the plug on Grandma. G: The idea that there aren\u2019t trade-offs is an outrageous thing. Most countries know that there are trade-offs, but here, we manage to have the notion that there aren\u2019t any. So that\u2019s unfortunate, to not have people think, \u201cHey, there are finite resources here.\u201d\n\nBut they do want to have the government (or bioethics committees delegated the task by government) decide \u201cwhen to pull the plug on grandma.\u201d Moreover, \u201dtrade offs\u201d is a code term in this context for death panels.\n\nA few points I made about these matters at the World Affairs Council symposium on Obamacare earlier this week:\n\nPatients should be treated based on their individual circumstances, not as members of a \u201cclass\u201d or group. Refusing wanted efficacious non-elective treatment is coercion\u2013in essence, a duty to die. Death panels will destroy what shaky trust remains in our health care system, particularly, I think, among minority communities. Death panels undermine Hippocratic values and deprofessionalize medicine. Education is already promoting better, less expensive care decisions. Very few terminally ill people insist on ICU treatment at the end. Hospice participation now exceeds 40%. How can we justify refusing non-elective treatment based on invidious classifications when we keep expanding what we call \u201cbasic health care\u201d to elective, life-style enhancing procedures and interventions? For example, in California today, gay and lesbian persons are legally entitled to expensive fertility treatments if they are covered by group health insurance\u2013whether they are actually infertile or not. I only see this trend growing. If we have to cut back through regulatory changes, how about starting on elective interventions that don\u2019t impact physical health?
