But what exactly does that mean?\n\nIn our case, it actually refers to the fact that there\u2019s a GOP \u201cstronghold\u201d in this county. But what has that done for us at the federal and state levels? Actually, very little, especially when you consider the lack of anything meaningful, other than the passing of bad bills by Congressman Kevin Brady, after 20 years in office. Come to think of it, is there anything worthwhile that\u2019s come out of his office, except a fancy chart of Obamacare which he ostensibly helped to pass, despite some show votes to the contrary?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn such a GOP stronghold where time and again we\u2019ve sent Brady up to do the nation\u2019s business on our behalf, all he\u2019s done is come back to \u201creport\u201d what \u201cgood\u201d has happened there as we move toward a $20 trillion debt load as a country, and all the while his ghostwriter here writes about how much he\u2019s accomplished. In the meantime, Brady\u2019s built a huge campaign war chest (over $2 million) by mostly out-of-state lobbyist PACs, that is second to none ( https://www.usvotesmart.com/index.php/candidate/view/26/22).\n\nAfter reviewing his campaign finance reports, where over 75 percent of his contributions come from outside the state of Texas, do you really think he\u2019s looking out for \u201cour\u201d best interests?\n\nThe truth is that he\u2019s really done nothing, other than pass bad bills, while being a dutiful sidekick to liberal speakers like John Boehner (whom he unbelievably called a conservative a few years ago) and now Paul Ryan. And he claims that since he\u2019s now inherited the \u201ccoveted\u201d Ways & Means chair position by doing what Boehner/Ryan/Pelosi, et al told him to do, he can finally orchestrate some meaningful policy. Oh really, Mr. Brady? In 20 years, you have shown nothing that would lead me to believe you will. No \u201ctough\u201d votes from you, as your ad proclaims, that runs 24/7, paid for by those lobbyists.\n\nIt\u2019s bad enough that the (truly) conservative Heritage Foundation gave him a failing grade of \u201c55\u201d (that\u2019s a big fat \u201cF\u201d). http://www.heritageactionscorecard.com/members/member/B000755. But even worse, he\u2019s voted more times (16) for debt increases than Sheila Jackson Lee (14).\n\nIn fact, here are just a few of the bad bills he was a part of:\n\n\u2022 Brady voted for more NSA spying on U.S. Citizens\n\nH.R. 2397 Surveillance of Phone Records July, 2013\n\n\u2022 Brady voted for more CISPA spying on U.S. Citizens\n\nH.R. 624 Internet Spy Program April, 2014\n\n\u2022 Brady voted for more NDAA detention of U.S. Citizens\n\nH.R. 4435 Indefinite Detention without a trial May, 2014\n\n\u2022 Brady voted to fund Obama Care and Obama\u2019s Executive Amnesty.\n\nH.R. 83 CRomnibus $1.1Trillion Funding Bill December, 2014\n\n\u2022 Brady voted for a labor union bailout & more power to the president\n\nH.R. 2146 OBAMAtrade TPA Secret Trade Deal June, 2015\n\n\u2022 Brady voted for the $1.2 trillion Omnibus Bill of 2015\n\nConsolidated Appropriations Act, 2016.\n\nIt\u2019s said that the U.S. Congress has an overall rating below 10 percent. That\u2019s true, but the problem is that everyone thinks their congressman is not part of the problem. That it\u2019s someone else\u2019s representative. Well, unfortunately, it\u2019s quite evident that Brady has been part of the problem. Any of Brady\u2019s three challengers would be infinitely better than him. We happen to think that Steve Toth\u2019s proven conservative, legislative experience in the Texas House will serve him and us well in the U.S. Congress. It\u2019s why the Montgomery County Tea Party chose Toth.\n\nBrady\u2019s had his chance. He blew it. His time has passed. It\u2019s time for a change.\n\nVote for Steve Toth for Congress.\n\nJohn Wertz is the Vetting Committee Chair of the Montgomery County Tea Party(MCTP).", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "www.yourconroenews.com", "description": "Did you know that Montgomery County is the \u201creddest\u201d (GOP representation) in the state of Texas and fourth in the U.S.?
