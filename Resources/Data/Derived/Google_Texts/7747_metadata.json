The \u201crecent surge of libertarianism among conservative academics, advocates, politicians, and of course, voters,\u201d Lazarus worried, has now \u201cbegun to register at the Supreme Court.\u201d\n\nIndeed it has. For instance, although the outcome was also cheered by progressives, the Supreme Court\u2019s blockbuster 2013 ruling against the Defense of Marriage Act was heavily flecked with libertarian legal principles, including both a robust defense of individual liberty and a lengthy ode to federalism. What\u2019s more, Justice Antonin Scalia\u2019s dissent in the case effectively accused the majority of engaging in a bout of libertarian judicial activism. \u201cThe Constitution does not forbid the government to enforce traditional moral and sexual norms,\u201d Scalia fumed.\n\nThat libertarian trend continued apace when the Court wrapped up its most recent term last week. Indeed, in case after case this term, the justices issued one broadly libertarian ruling after another, voting against aggregate limits on campaign finance spending; in favor of a legal challenge to a speech-restricting Ohio law; against warrantless cellphone snooping by the police; against expansive government privileges for public-sector unions; and against the executive overreach of the Obama administration. Lazarus was definitely right to worry.\n\nWhat explains the libertarian surge? In 2010 I reported on the rise of a distinct libertarian legal movement within the ranks of the larger conservative legal community. Led by such pioneering figures as Georgetown law professor Randy Barnett and Cato Institute legal scholar Roger Pilon, the libertarians took aim at the reigning legal orthodoxies on both the right and the left, urging broad constitutional protections for the individual against the state in wide areas of life. To put that in simpler terms, they came out swinging on behalf of both gay rights and gun rights.\n\nThat principled stance, which was backed by decades of painstaking legal and historical scholarship by Barnett, Pilon, and others, gradually began winning new converts to the cause. In time, the libertarian legal movement began to shape the outcome of major cases as well.\n\nAs one measure of this widening success, consider the example of the Cato Institute\u2019s Center for Constitutional Studies, which weighs in on the major legal issues of the day by submitting amicus briefs at the Supreme Court. In 2013, Cato filed 19 briefs and came out on the winning side in 15 of those cases. This year, Cato\u2019s win-loss record at SCOTUS was an impressive 10-1.\n\nAll that seismic libertarian activity is starting to shake things up at the Supreme Court.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "Roughly one year ago, shortly after the U.S. Supreme Court concluded its 2012-2013 term, progressive legal activist Simon Lazarus took to the pages of", "title": "The Supreme Court Now Leans Libertarian", "url": "http://reason.com/blog/2014/07/08/the-supreme-court-now-leans-libertarian", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/mc/droot/July2010.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Roughly one year ago, shortly after the U.S. Supreme Court\nconcluded its 2012-2013 term, progressive legal activist Simon\nLazarus took to the pages of The New Republic to \nsound the alarm against what he saw as the growing threat of\nlibertarianism and its \u201cpotentially seismic\u201d influence on the\nCourt.
