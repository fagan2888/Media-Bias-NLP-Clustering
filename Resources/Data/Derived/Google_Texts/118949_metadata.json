Clementa C. Pinckney of the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, S.C., was remarkable not only because the president sang the opening refrain of \u201cAmazing Grace\u201d on live television, and not only because of his eloquence in memorializing the pastor and eight other parishioners killed by a white gunman. It was also remarkable because the eulogy drew on all of Mr. Obama\u2019s gifts of language and empathy and searching intellect \u2014 first glimpsed in \u201cDreams From My Father,\u201d his deeply felt 1995 memoir about identity and family. And because it used those gifts to talk about the complexities of race and justice, situating them within an echoing continuum in time that reflected both Mr. Obama\u2019s own long view of history, and the panoramic vision of America, shared by Abraham Lincoln and the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., as a country in the process of perfecting itself.\n\nMr. Obama\u2019s view of the nation\u2019s history as a more than two-century journey to make the promises of the Declaration of Independence (\u201cthat all men are created equal\u201d) real for everyone, his former chief speechwriter, Jon Favreau, suggested in an email, is \u201cboth an American and a religious sentiment\u201d \u2014 predicated upon the belief that individual sinners and a country scarred by the original sin of slavery can overcome the past through \u201cpersistent, courageous, sometimes frustrating efforts.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nFor Mr. Obama, America is \u201ca constant work in progress,\u201d a nation founded upon the idea of new beginnings, and the enduring belief, as he once wrote in an essay about Lincoln, that \u201cwe can constantly remake ourselves to fit our larger dreams.\u201d Like his two moving speeches in Selma, Ala., in 2007 and this year, Mr. Obama\u2019s eulogy used the prism of history to amplify and crystallize the meaning of the occasion \u2014 a wide-angle lens that reminds us of the distance we\u2019ve come from the days of slavery, segregation and Jim Crow, and the distance we have yet to travel in addressing enduring prejudice and inequities.\n\nThese are themes that have animated Mr. Obama\u2019s writings and oratory for years, going back to his 2004 Democratic National Convention keynote address and 2008 \u201cA More Perfect Union\u201d speech, to his 2013 speech commemorating the 1963 March on Washington. History, he believes, is an odyssey, a crossing, a relay in which one generation\u2019s achievements serve as the paving stones for the next generation\u2019s journey.\n\nIn his eulogy on June 26, Mr. Obama recounted the history of Charleston\u2019s \u201cMother Emanuel\u201d \u2014 how \u201ca church built by blacks seeking liberty\u201d was \u201cburned to the ground because its founders sought to end slavery\u201d and how it rose again, \u201ca phoenix from these ashes,\u201d to become a sacred place where Dr. King would preach from its pulpit. He spoke of how history \u201cmust be a manual\u201d to avoid \u201crepeating the mistakes of the past\u201d while building \u201ca roadway toward a better world.\u201d\n\nVideo\n\nThis looking back at what has been overcome and looking forward toward a better tomorrow is a bedrock tradition in the black church \u2014 which, having borne witness to so much suffering, looks to the promised land ahead. And it is a fundamental theme in the sermons of Dr. King, who talked in his great \u201cDream\u201d speech of hewing \u201cout of the mountain of despair a stone of hope,\u201d of transforming \u201cthe jangling discords of our nation into a beautiful symphony of brotherhood.\u201d Mr. Obama, like Dr. King, is fond of quoting the words of the 19th-century minister and abolitionist Theodore Parker: \u201cThe arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn grappling with the wounds of the Civil War, Lincoln similarly looked to the broad vistas of history and the lessons of Scripture \u2014 both for solace and as a way of framing and universalizing his own arguments. In the Gettysburg Address, he effectively redefined the founders\u2019 vision of America and how we read the Constitution and Declaration of Independence, and in his Second Inaugural Address, he recognized the sin of slavery and the terrible scourge of war that was part of its price, and at the same time, sought to \u201cbind up the nation\u2019s wounds,\u201d to find a way forward \u201cwith malice toward none, with charity for all.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"tone": "feature", "ptime": 20150703175301, "twitter": {"description": "The president\u2019s speech at the funeral of the Rev.
