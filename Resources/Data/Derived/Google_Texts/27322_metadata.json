But most students aren\u2019t getting the education they need before they get to campus.\n\nJust 17 states require high school students take a personal finance course, and only six require testing of personal finance concepts, according to the Council for Economic Education. Three out of four American teens can\u2019t even make sense of a paystub.\n\nBut hey, at least they\u2019re confident.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "A new study confirms it: College students think they know everything, at least when it comes to personal finance.
