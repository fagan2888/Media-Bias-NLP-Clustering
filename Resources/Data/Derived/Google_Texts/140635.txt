× Nixon vetoes bill limiting scholarships for immigrants

KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) _ Gov. Jay Nixon says he is vetoing a measure that would block immigrants who are illegally in the U.S. from receiving money under Missouri’s A+ scholarship program.

Nixon made the announcement Saturday during a speech to the National Council of La Raza. The Hispanic advocacy group is having its annual convention in Kansas City.

Supporters of the bill said it was meant to limit the number of people receiving scholarships in order to preserve them for Missouri residents.

But Democratic opponents and advocates for immigrants said it would cause financial hardship for hardworking students seeking to get a college education and contribute to society.

Nixon said that rather than punishing students, the state should be encouraging those who are willing to work hard.

The scholarship bill is SB 224.
