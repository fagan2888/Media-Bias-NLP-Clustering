Apply to join our Editorial Board. (Photo: yuriz, Getty Images/iStockphoto)

We're looking for a few friendly faces who are engaged in our community and want their voices to be heard.

Does that sound like you? Then apply to be a member of The Post-Crescent's Editorial Board!

We meet at noon every Thursday for about 30 minutes to talk about an interesting topic while we enjoy lunch together. All we ask is that you come with an open mind ready to weigh in on that week's topic.

It's a great way to become involved in our Valley Voices section and to learn how we operate as a news staff. Reporters join the meetings periodically to share their expertise.

To apply, please send me a few paragraphs about yourself and why you're interested, along with your contact information. It doesn't have to be anything fancy â€” we just want to get a feel for who you are.

The community members we select will serve on the board through the end of the year.

Please email your application to sriley@postcrescent.com or mail a letter to me at 306 W. Washington St., Appleton WI 54911. We'll accept them through Sept. 15.
