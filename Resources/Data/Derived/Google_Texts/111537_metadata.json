The cost of the insurance would be offset by weekly employee contribution of up to 45 cents from their paychecks.\n\nThe Family Leave Insurance bill also proposes to raise the Temporary Disability Insurance premium but split the cost between employer and employee\n\nCurrently, the state provides $170 a week in TDI for workers caring for close relatives who are sick. It is unclear how much that figure would rise under the new legislation.\n\nThe bill passed on an 84 to 40 vote and was delivered to the Senate.\n\nAssemblywoman Catherine Nolan's bill expands the definition of a family member to include a child -- biological, adoptive, or foster -- a domestic partner, parent, grandchild, grandparent and sibling or parent of a spouse or domestic partner. What she called the \"modern family.\"\n\nThe Assembly also passed a bill that would limit the co-pay for child care subsidies to 20 percent of the household income above federal poverty level as well as a bill that would revise the formula for determining household income to exclude money made by individuals under the age of 18.\n\nAssembly Speaker Sheldon Silver said the cost of the measures will be released in next week's Assembly budget proposal.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "family leave insurance, new york assembly, news", "title": "NY Assembly OKs bill requiring employers to have paid family leave insurance", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"NY Assembly OKs bill requiring employers to have paid family leave insurance\", \"link\": \"http://www.syracuse.com/news/index.ssf/2014/03/ny_assembly_oks_bill_requiring_employers_to_have_paid_family_leave_insurance.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://imgick.syracuse.com/home/syr-media/width620/img/news/photo/2014/03/silverpromojpg-69225e02dea65d7c.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"12364563\", \"pub_date\": \"2014-03-06T02:05:25Z\", \"author\": \"The Associated Press\", \"tags\": [\"@topstory\",\"family leave insurance\",\"new york assembly\"] }", "twitter": {"creator": "@AP", "site": "@syracusedotcom", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "The Assembly also passed a bill that would limit the co-pay for child care subsidies to 20 percent of the household income above federal poverty level."}, "article_date_updated": "Wednesday, March 05, 2014,  9:05 PM", "parsely-metadata": "{\"short_title\": \"\", \"image_url\": \"http://media.syracuse.com/news/photo/2014/03/silverpromojpg-69225e02dea65d7c.jpg\", \"author_name\": \"syrapnews\", \"author_nickname\": \"The Associated Press\", \"author_id\": \"1826437\", \"source_blog_name\": \"Central NY News\", \"source_blog_url\": \"http://www.syracuse.com/news/index.ssf/\", \"sponsored_content\": \"0\" }", "og": {"site_name": "syracuse.com", "description": "The Assembly also passed a bill that would limit the co-pay for child care subsidies to 20 percent of the household income above federal poverty level.", "title": "NY Assembly OKs bill requiring employers to have paid family leave insurance", "url": "http://www.syracuse.com/news/index.ssf/2014/03/ny_assembly_oks_bill_requiring_employers_to_have_paid_family_leave_insurance.html", "image": "http://imgick.syracuse.com/home/syr-media/width620/img/news/photo/2014/03/silverpromojpg-69225e02dea65d7c.jpg", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "syracuse.com", "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/APNews"}, "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Wednesday, March 05, 2014,  8:56 PM", "article_author": "The Associated Press", "Description": "The Assembly also passed a bill that would limit the co-pay for child care subsidies to 20 percent of the household income above federal poverty level."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2b05\"", "article_summary": "One of the bills requires employers to have paid family leave insurance for their employees.\nThe bill passed on an 84 to 40 vote and was delivered to the Senate.\nThe Family Leave Insurance bill also proposes to raise the Temporary Disability Insurance premium but split the cost between employer and employeeCurrently, the state provides $170 a week in TDI for workers caring for close relatives who are sick.\nAssembly Speaker Sheldon Silver said the cost of the measures will be released in next week's Assembly budget proposal.\nALBANY, N.Y. -- New York's Assembly passed a series of bills Wednesday intended to provide affordable child care, increase funding for child care subsidies and establish paid leave for medical emergencies, the birth or adoption of a child or to take care of a sick relative."}
