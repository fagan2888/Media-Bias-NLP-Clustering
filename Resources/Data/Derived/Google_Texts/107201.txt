LINCOLN, Neb. (AP) - Shavon Shields will follow Nebraska’s concussion protocol after banging his head on the court in a hard fall during a game against Rutgers on Saturday.

The athletic department said in a statement that Shields was released from a Lincoln hospital after a CT scan was negative.

He was alert and able to move his arms and legs when he was taken out of Pinnacle Bank Arena in the second half. He briefly lost consciousness.

Shields’ mother, Senia Shields, rushed to his side as medics tended to him in front of a silent crowd of 12,981. He received a standing ovation as he was wheeled out of the arena on a backboard.

“We are relieved and thankful Shavon has been released, and that his injuries aren’t more serious,” coach Tim Miles said. “We will follow the proper protocol to get him back to full speed. I know Shavon and his family are grateful for everyone’s thoughts and prayers.”

Shields was hurt when Rutgers’ D.J. Foreman started to go up for a shot under the basket with 8:49 left. Shields, approaching Foreman from behind, flipped over Foreman’s back. He landed on his left shoulder and smacked his head on the floor.

Miles said Shields was knocked out for about a minute.

“He didn’t recall anything that had happened,” Miles said.

Shields’ teammates took to Twitter after the game in support.

“Most basketball players go through a fall like that. It’s a matter of how serious it is when you land,” Andrew White III said. “You can hit your back, neck, head. He was doing his job and that’s the risk of it. Very scary moment.”

Shields, a senior from Olathe, Kansas, is the son of 2015 Pro Football Hall of Fame inductee Will Shields. He scored 17 points in the 87-63 win over Rutgers and is the Huskers’ second-leading scorer this season. He has started 106 consecutive games.
