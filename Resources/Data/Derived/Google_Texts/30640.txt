Albany

Trying to analyze a roster before the season, especially at the minor-league level, is like trying to determine whether Obamacare will work. It can stimulate discussion, but no one knows for sure until things play out.

What we know about the 2013-14 Albany Devils, who begin their fourth American Hockey League season at 3 p.m. Sunday in Hartford against the Wolf Pack, is mostly statistical:

The current roster has 23 players.

Eight of those have a combined 685 games of NHL experience, but 83 percent of that belongs to just two players: Cam Janssen (312) and Rod Pelley (256).

Only seven — all forwards — are older than 25: Janssen, Pelley and Tim Sestito are 29, Chris McKelvie is 28, Darcy Zajac is 27, and Mike Sislo as well as Joe Whitney are 26.

Four are professional rookies, and three others have played less than half a season at the AHL level or higher.

"It's crazy," said Sestito, who begins his ninth pro season, fifth in the Devils' organization. "You blink and you're one of the older guys. I felt like I was one of the younger guys, and now we're comparing birthdays to see who the oldest guy is."

Turns out that the eldest statesman is Janssen, by 135 days over Sestito and 139 days over Pelley.

Will youth be served? Again, things have to play out. Here is how the Devils look by position:

Goaltenders

Former Union star Keith Kinkaid, 25, begins his third season, the first without sharing time with Jeff Frazee, who signed to play in Italy.

A pair of 21-year-olds, Scott Wedgewood and Maxime Clermont, are in reserve. Clermont will start the season at ECHL Elmira.

"It's time to take another step," said coach Rick Kowalsky, beginning his fourth season in Albany. "Keith last year made progress. He's going to have to build on that. We're still going to look to use two guys, but Keith's going to be pushed, and he's going to have to earn the right to be in that net like he did last year, more than just rotating games. If he takes charge and plays the way he's capable of playing, he's definitely going to get that opportunity."

Defensemen

If size were money, the Devils would be rich. Of the seven defensemen in residence, two are 6 feet, 5 inches, and two others 6-4 — and that is after sending 6-5 Harry Young and 6-4 Raman Hrabarenka to Elmira.

"Hopefully," said Kinkaid, laughing, "they clear the net and don't screen us with their size."

In addition to Eric Gelinas, who has 59 points in his first two pro seasons, Albany should get some offensive spark from the blue line from rookie Jon Merrill and Reece Scarlett. Steady Corbin McPherson, the oldest of the group at 25, played 70 of the team's final 72 games last season.

"It's fun that I'm one of the old guys now, and I get to help the younger guys a little bit," said Gelinas, 22. "We have some 20 years old. I was there my first year. I know how they feel.

Forwards

At even strength last season the Devils outscored opponents 147-145. The issue — and a major reason why the team missed the AHL playoffs for the 12th time in 13 years — was special teams.

The 29th-ranked power play and 25th-ranked penalty kill produced 48 goals while surrendering 80.

"I know that's going to be a focus," said Sestito, likely to be a key figure on both units. "A couple of goals here and there will help us out."

There's always a question in an organization known for defense as to whether there are enough scorers to improve Albany's position of 23rd in goals.

Two of last year's top three scorers — Matt Anderson (Russia) and Steve Zalewski (Finland) — headed to Europe. Whitney was the Devils' top point-producer. Rookie Reid Boucher scored an Ontario Hockey League-high 62 goals, but will that translate to the AHL?

"We're going to have to rely on some guys to score; I don't want to say they're unproven, but may have history at another level," Kowalsky said. "And some guys who we've had here we're going to need some big things out of. We know we're younger, but we can use that energy to our advantage."
