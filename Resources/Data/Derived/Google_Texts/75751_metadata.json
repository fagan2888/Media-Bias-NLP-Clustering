(AP) - When Matt King built his dream home with his wife, Kim, in Bend in 2011, they chose NorthWest Crossing because of its suburban feel and walkability. Access to nearby businesses and schools was important to Matt, who is blind.\n\nThe Kings didn\u2019t know that just a few years after they settled in Bend, Matt would be offered a job with Facebook, leave his position at IBM and their home in Oregon, and move to the bustling Bay Area.\n\nConsidering Facebook\u2019s company goal is to connect people across the world, he couldn\u2019t pass up the opportunity.\n\n\u201cWhen I saw their mission and my mission aligned, I was like, \u2018Wow,\u2019\u201d King, 49, said. \u201cI drank the Kool-Aid as they say.\u201d\n\nFor years, King worked as an engineer for IBM. He started there after graduating from the University of Notre Dame.\n\nKing is blind from retinitis pigmentosa. Although he was born with the disease, he could see for many years; his vision decreased as the disease progressed.\n\nLast week, in a teal Facebook T-shirt, King sat on his patio-style front porch in Bend, with a laptop nearby. King has an apartment in Menlo Park, California, where he is working full time on Facebook\u2019s accessibility engineering team.\n\nAs an accessibility engineer, King is helping make the user interface easier to use for people of all abilities. User interface can be anything from a keyboard to a screen to text on a website: anything a person uses to navigate a device. In King\u2019s case, he\u2019s making Facebook more adaptable.\n\nFor example, the team might change the color or shading of text on the website to make sure it\u2019s adaptable to programs that adjust for color blindness. Or the team might find ways for Facebook videos to be more accessible for people with hearing impairment.\n\nOn his own laptop, the only added feature King has is a software program that reads text aloud. But that software doesn\u2019t work smoothly with every website out there.\n\n\u201cMost of the Web poses accessibility challenges,\u201d King said. \u201cOne product I\u2019m actively working on right now is the Facebook news feed. We want to make the experience of reading the news feed more enjoyable if you use a screen reader.\u201d\n\nKing is also working on similar features for messenger.com, Facebook\u2019s stand-alone messaging site.\n\nKing said 20 percent of the world\u2019s population needs some kind of accommodation. By ignoring those people, the rest of the world is missing out on connections. At Facebook, King and his colleagues want to change that.\n\nEqual access for people of all abilities has long been a priority of Matt\u2019s.\n\nKim King knows her husband\u2019s reputation as someone who wants to make an impact in encouraging people of all abilities.\n\n\u201cPeople around the nation know what Matt is about,\u201d she said, adding since word has spread about Matt\u2019s move to California, people in Bend have been asking her how it\u2019s going for him, and if he\u2019s OK to travel and live on his own.\n\nThat\u2019s because for now, Kim and their two children are still living in Bend: Both kids had their first day of school last week.\n\nShe lets people know Matt is not only capable, but a highly independent person.\n\nThey decided he should try to travel up to Bend twice a month, for a few days at a time. During those visits, King is able to work from home. He said over the next year, they will decide how, or if, they want to move the family down to California.\n\n\u201cIt is a big adjustment,\u201d Kim said. \u201cIt is not always easy, but it is a great opportunity for our whole family.\u201d\n\nKing also realizes it\u2019s tough for his children, in fifth and eighth grade, to decide between staying in Bend and seeing less of their dad or moving to a new state to be with him.\n\nHe had a similar decision, between familiar and new, when Facebook came to him with the job offer.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t anticipate leaving,\u201d King said. \u201cI had a fabulous run at IBM.\u201d\n\nIn the beginning of his time at IBM, King lived in New York, but management later allowed him to work remotely in Colorado Springs so he could dedicate more time to tandem cycling, a sport in which he competes with a seeing partner.\n\nKing\u2019s first international cycling competition was at the 1996 Atlanta Paralympic Games, where he and his partner set a world record. Two years later, at the International Paralympic Committee\u2019s World Cycling Championships, King earned a silver medal. He\u2019s also a 12-time national champion among American blind cyclists and has placed in the top three among America\u2019s best sighted track cyclists.\n\nKing and his wife started their family in Colorado Springs, but when they decided to build a home, cycling friends nudged them to check out Bend. The Kings fell in love with the town, and their home was finished in 2011 after dedication to detail by the couple, as well as the architect and builder.\n\nAlthough he wasn\u2019t looking to leave IBM, King was open to \u201cnew ways to grow (his) expertise.\u201d\n\nFacebook was supportive of the work King was doing outside IBM with the World Wide Web Consortium, an organization that wants the Web to continue to grow and improve.\n\nWith it, King championed standards for more accessibility.\n\n\u201cThe thing about going to Facebook Kim and I saw is that it gives us the ability to grow and impact more people,\u201d King said.\n\nKim said \u201cFacebook totally matches Matt\u2019s personality and goals.\u201d\n\nWorking, and living, in a tech-minded community has made it easier to make connections.\n\nKing is enjoying the challenging work, and said he has settled into his apartment there, although he \u201chad a lot to learn\u201d about the Bay Area.\n\nKing commutes to and from work each day on a Facebook employee shuttle. He also lives near a station for Caltrain, a commuter rail.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s so many ways to be involved in the tech community that I don\u2019t get to have here,\u201d King said of Bend.\n\nWith the \u201cgravitational pull\u201d of the tech world there, he said he hasn\u2019t had a hard time making friends. But he hasn\u2019t found a riding partner in California yet since his bikes are still in Bend.\n\nAnd as for his 50th birthday quickly approaching, he doesn\u2019t have any kind of crazy athletic pursuit to check off before then. No bucket list, he said smiling.\n\n\u201cAm I supposed to?\u201d King said.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Bulletin, http://www.bendbulletin.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "When Matt King built his dream home with his wife, Kim, in Bend in 2011, they chose NorthWest Crossing because of its suburban feel and walkability.
