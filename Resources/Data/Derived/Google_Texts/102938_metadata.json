The remaining 18 percent were school administrators, higher education officials, students and community members.\n\nA total of 90 people responded to the survey. No margin of error was listed.\n\nAmong the public comments included with the survey was a letter from Jason Bohrer, president of the Lignite Energy Council, an association representing North Dakota\u2019s coal industry. Bohrer was critical of the standard\u2019s emphasis on human-caused climate change.\n\n\u201cAn important principle of science is that the study of our natural world remains largely composed of theories in pursuit of proof,\u201d Bohrer wrote. \u201cAs such, it is important that subject matter being presented to students as part of the science curriculum should not be used to teach \u2018standards\u2019 in the absence of hard facts to support the conclusion drawn by the standard.\u201d\n\nOther comments included in the survey anonymously called the standards \u201cdisjointed\u201d and suggested they instruct students to \u201cfeel bad for consuming natural resources.\u201d\n\nA request for comment sent to Superintendent of Public Schools Kirsten Baesler received no response.\n\nNorth Dakota began implementing common core standards in 2010.\n\nRead More on Watchdog.org.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A survey of mostly parents and teachers conducted by the North Dakota Department of Public Instruction found a low level of satisfaction with Common Core.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "A survey of mostly parents and teachers conducted by the North Dakota Department of Public Instruction found a low level of satisfaction with Common Core.", "title": "Common Core Standards Get Failing Grade in North Dakota", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/140709_CommonCore_Watchdog.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-07-10T16:54:14+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1zrCI7N"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "A survey of mostly parents and teachers conducted by the North Dakota Department of Public Instruction found a low level of satisfaction with Common Core.", "creator": "@dailysignal", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/140709_CommonCore_Watchdog.jpg"}, "title": "Common Core Standards Get Failing Grade in North Dakota", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Education", "tag": "common core", "published_time": "2014-07-10T10:13:41+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-07-10T16:54:14+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Common core, education, ND common core, north dakota common core, k-12"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1bdf\"", "article_summary": "BISMARCK, N.D.\u2014A survey of mostly parents and teachers conducted by the North Dakota Department of Public Instruction has found a low level of satisfaction with Common Core science standards.\nA plurality of 38 percent of respondents strongly disagreed the standards are clear, 44 percent strongly disagreed they are sufficiently rigorous, and 40 percent strongly disagreed the number of standards per grade are reasonable for a school year.\nNorth Dakota began implementing common core standards in 2010.\nAmong the public comments included with the survey was a letter from Jason Bohrer, president of the Lignite Energy Council, an association representing North Dakota\u2019s coal industry.\nBohrer was critical of the standard\u2019s emphasis on human-caused climate change."}
