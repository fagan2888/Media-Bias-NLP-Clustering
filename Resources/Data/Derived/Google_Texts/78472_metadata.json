( David McNew/Getty Images )\n\nA bill that would require the most stringent regulations in the country on the use of antibiotics in livestock is on Gov. Jerry Brown\u2019s desk.\n\nIf signed into law, California would ban the common practice of using drugs to fatten animals and would require a prescription from a veterinarian for other uses, such as fighting disease or infection.\n\nThe bill, SB27, would effectively end over-the-counter sales of antibiotics for livestock. It also calls for monitoring by California\u2019s Department of Food and Agriculture and development of best practices for antibiotic use in livestock.\n\n\u201cIt will make California the first state in the nation to put constraints on the regular ongoing uses of antibiotics,\u201d said Avinash Kar, a senior attorney with the Natural Resources Defense Council, which supports the bill. \u201cThese are all important advances, and we are hopeful that this will mean that other states will follow California\u2019s lead and, hopefully, even the federal government.\u201d\n\nMore than 70 percent of the antibiotics sold in the U.S. are for animal use. Widespread use \u2014 in people, too \u2014 contributes to the rise of drug-resistant bacteria. (As an aside, the \u201c70 percent\u201d number is the subject of some debate, but appears to be quite accurate.)\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that 2 million people get sick every year with a drug-resistant infection and 23,000 die as a result of those illnesses.\n\n\u201cMassive amounts of antibiotics are used on farms in the creation of meat,\u201d said Elisa Odabashian, director of Consumers Union\u2019s West Coast office, which also backs the bill.\n\n\u201cIf they\u2019re used to treat a disease, like antibiotics are used to treat a disease in humans, for a limited time, we\u2019re fine with that,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s using it for growth promotion or disease prevention that creates these adaptive superbugs that makes medicines ineffective.\u201d\n\nBoth the NRDC and Consumers Union had originally opposed the bill, labeling it too weak. It was first introduced last December.\n\nBut in the final two weeks of the session, which ended last Friday, Odabashian and Kar say that the governor\u2019s office got involved and pushed for a tougher bill. It was only after the bill was amended to be more stringent did the NRDC and Consumers Union drop their opposition.\n\nBrown had been pushing for a tougher livestock antibiotics bill since last year, when he vetoed SB835, a bill many advocates opposed saying it was too lax. In his veto statement, Brown said he wanted state regulators to work with legislators to find \u201cnew and effective ways to reduce the unnecessary antibiotics used for livestock and poultry.\u201d\n\nSen. Jerry Hill, D-San Mateo, is the author of both last year\u2019s bill and this one. \u201cI worked very closely with Gov. Brown\u2019s administration on SB27 and I\u2019m confident the governor will sign it,\u201d Hill said in an email. \u201cThere is no other state that has regulations as strong as those proposed by the bill. What we are able to accomplish here in California will hopefully set the trend for the rest of the country.\u201d\n\nThe governor\u2019s office did not return a call seeking comment in time for publication.\n\nIndustry groups have not mounted strong opposition. California\u2019s Farm Bureau, for example, is neutral on the bill. Noelle Cremers, its director of natural resources and commodities, said that antibiotic resistance is an issue in livestock. \u201cWe have members who are not able to use antibiotics that they used to,\u201d she said. \u201cSo we recognize the importance of being engaged in the discussion of having antibiotics available and effective into the future.\u201d\n\nThe Farm Bureau remains neutral on the bill because of its requirement of a veterinarian\u2019s prescription for antibiotics. California will be the first state in the country to require these prescriptions. Cremers said it will be a challenge for some livestock producers in rural areas to find a veterinarian.\n\n\u201cThat requirement is significant and is going to be a burden to some of our members, and that\u2019s why we couldn\u2019t support the bill,\u201d she said.\n\nThe governor has until early October to sign or veto the bill.", "article_metadata": {"description": "If signed into law, California would become the first state to ban use of antibiotics to fatten animals.", "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"Bill Making California Toughest in U.S. on Livestock Antibiotics Now Up to Governor\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/2015\\/09\\/16\\/bill-making-california-toughest-in-u-s-on-livestock-antibiotics-now-up-to-governor\\/\",\"pub_date\":\"2015-09-16 00:01:50\",\"mod_date\":\"2015-09-16 17:43:12\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":78255,\"author_id\":\"240\",\"author_name\":\"Lisa Aliferis\",\"author_display_name\":\"Lisa Aliferis\",\"tags\":[\"Antibiotic Resistance\",\"Science\"],\"categories\":[\"Policy\"],\"image\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/sites\\/27\\/2015\\/09\\/RS8993_467012475-e1442373278734.jpg\"}", "og": {"site_name": "State of Health", "description": "If signed into law, California would become the first state to ban use of antibiotics to fatten animals.", "title": "Bill Making California Toughest in U.S. on Livestock Antibiotics Now Up to Governor", "url": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/2015/09/16/bill-making-california-toughest-in-u-s-on-livestock-antibiotics-now-up-to-governor/", "image": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/wp-content/uploads/sites/27/2015/09/RS8993_467012475-1440x960.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@kqedhealth", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@"}, "fb": {"app_id": 160023622793}, "keywords": "antibiotic resistance,science", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Brown had been pushing for a tougher livestock antibiotics bill since last year, when he vetoed SB835, a bill many advocates opposed saying it was too lax.\nIf the governor signs the bill, antibiotics could be administered only with a prescription from a veterinarian.\nThe bill, SB27, would effectively end over-the-counter sales of antibiotics for livestock.\n( David McNew/Getty Images )A bill that would require the most stringent regulations in the country on the use of antibiotics in livestock is on Gov.\n\u201cIf they\u2019re used to treat a disease, like antibiotics are used to treat a disease in humans, for a limited time, we\u2019re fine with that,\u201d she said."}
