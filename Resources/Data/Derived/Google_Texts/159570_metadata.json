And they likely don\u2019t know Katina Powell from Olympic sprinter Asafa Powell.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t deserve this,\u201d Lewis told reporters Friday. \u201cThis team doesn\u2019t deserve this. We worked very hard and we put ourselves in a position to fulfill our dreams, and that was to play in the NCAA Tournament, and we feel like that\u2019s been taken away.\u201d\n\nLouisville now knows that at least some of the scandalous claims penned by Powell in her tell-all book published last year have merit. It\u2019s why the school announced this punishment in the middle of the Cardinals\u2019 19-4 season, one that was undoubtedly heading toward the NCAA Tournament, likely as a high seed.\n\nThe hope of those behind the decision is that the NCAA will exercise some leniency after seeing the school take accountability \u2014 if you want to call it that \u2014 for the rules that were broken on its grounds.\n\nBut who is supposed to be taking accountability for the players? Why are they the ones who always have to take the brunt of the punishment in these situations?\n\nLouisville coach Rick Pitino will continue to make his multimillion-dollar salary this season, his only monetary punishment being the missed bonuses that coaches collect for reaching various levels of the postseason. The president of the university? The athletic director? They\u2019ll be fine too.\n\nAs for Lee, Lewis and the rest of the Cardinals who had nothing to do with the scandal? They miss out on the ultimate goal for a Division I college basketball player: reaching the NCAA Tournament. The exposure on that grand stage that could help put them in position for future earnings in the sport, that is now gone too.\n\nPunish schools financially for allowing gross violations of rules to occur on their campuses. Heavily fine coaches overseeing these programs. (To his credit, Pitino suggested the same thing.) And, yes, the players who have involvement in these actions should bear a brunt of the justice as well.\n\nBut for those athletes going to class, training, playing and staying out of trouble? There is no justice for them in this broken system.\n\nNick Kosmider: 303-954-1516, nkosmider@ denverpost.com or @nickkosmider", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Kosmider: Cards stacked against Louisville basketball players", "title": "Kosmider: Cards stacked against Louisville basketball players", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/02/06/kosmider-cards-stacked-against-louisville-basketball-players/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160206__0347aaf9b2e7a0068f0f6a706700440bp1.jpg", "height": 498}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160206__0347aaf9b2e7a0068f0f6a706700440bp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2016-02-06T18:52:39+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-18T06:02:48+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "They miss out on the ultimate goal for a Division I college basketball player: reaching the NCAA Tournament.\nAnd, yes, the players who have involvement in these actions should bear a brunt of the justice as well.\nCertainly Damion Lee and Trey Lewis \u2014 graduate transfers who joined Louisville last summer, long after McGee had moved on from the program \u2014 didn\u2019t know the guy.\nIt\u2019s why the school announced this punishment in the middle of the Cardinals\u2019 19-4 season, one that was undoubtedly heading toward the NCAA Tournament, likely as a high seed.\nAs for Lee, Lewis and the rest of the Cardinals who had nothing to do with the scandal?"}
