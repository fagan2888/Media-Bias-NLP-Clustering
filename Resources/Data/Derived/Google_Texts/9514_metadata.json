He has asthma, allergies and other pre-existing conditions.\n\nRejections came left and right. No. No. NO. He was able to maintain a plan through COBRA, but at a staggering $626 monthly premium.\n\nTimes, as of October 1, have changed. Open enrollment for individual and family plans going into effect January 2014 under the federal Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare, has begun.\n\nIt\u2019s a world where a 29-year-old single man or woman without health insurance can log onto a federal or state run marketplace website, plunk down his or her info\u2014age, income, location, smoking status (not in California)\u2014and snag a healthcare plan, regardless of pre-existing conditions. It\u2019s a world where if that person makes below a certain income\u2014less than $28,725, according to Calfornia\u2019s exchange Covered California\u2014he or she can qualify for premium assistance, with the government paying part of monthly costs.\n\nIt's a world where my cousin logged on and found a plan for half the cost of what he had been paying. His copays will go from $30 to $3.\n\n\u201cNot having to stress about this stuff improves my quality of life,\u201d he says.\n\nSo which ACA qualified plans are best for younger people? Which plans benefit older folks with higher health risk? It all can seem, on the surface, utterly confusing.\n\nObamacare plans fit into four tiered categories: Bronze and Silver (which have low monthly premiums, higher deductibles), and Gold and Platinum (which have higher monthly premiums, no deductibles).\n\nPlatinum level plans cover the most, 90 percent of healthcare costs, with the insured covering 10 percent, and Bronze plans cover the least, 60 percent, with the insured paying 40 percent.\n\n\u201cMost people under the age of 30 would opt into a Bronze or Silver plan,\u201d says Dylan Roby, an assistant professor at the UCLA School of Public Health and a research scientist with the UCLA Center for Health Policy Research. \u201cIt depends on affordability and perceived risk. Generally people tend to only worry about health when it\u2019s in their self-interest when they\u2019re younger. When they\u2019re older, they feel like they\u2019re in the same pool.\u201d\n\nThe Bronze plan, out of the four tiers, has the highest medical and drug deductible, a steep $5,000, which is the amount that must be paid out of pocket by the insured before an insurer will pay any expenses. But the tier\u2019s monthly premium fee, varying according to insurer, is the lowest.\n\nFor instance, a 27-year-old single person living in downtown Los Angeles, who makes $20,000, would have a $161 premium under the Bronze level L.A. Care Health Plan, and qualify for $129 in premium assistance tax credits a month. That means a total monthly payment would be just $32.\n\nA Silver tier plan for the same person would have a $500 medical deductible, but with a higher premium still lowered by tax credits.\n\nGold and Platinum level plans have zero\u2014yes, ZERO\u2014deductibles. That makes them choice plans for older Americans, especially with chronic conditions, willing to pay higher premiums for more coverage. Next door to that 27-year-old in downtown L.A. could be a 55-year-old making $30,000, and he or she would still qualify for hefty tax credits under Gold and Platinum plans. A Molina Healthcare Gold plan would come to $498 per month, but with $247 in premium assistance, would only be $250 total monthly.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re getting a fairly good tax credit subsidy, and you\u2019re older, then the higher plans are more generous,\u201d says Roby. \u201cIf you\u2019re 55, you may own a house, and be retired, and have more to lose. Those people are more likely to upgrade their coverage since they have a more perceived risk of actually spending on healthcare.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Solvej Schou", "description": "With generous tax credits and a variety of coverage plans, there&#039;s something for any uninsured shopper.", "rights": "TakePart is the Social Action Network\u2122 of Participant Media. \u00a9 2008-2016 TakePart, LLC", "og": {"site_name": "TakePart", "description": "With generous tax credits and a variety of coverage plans, there&#039;s something for any uninsured shopper.", "title": "How to Sign Up For Obamacare: What Kind of Plan Should You Choose?", "url": "http://www.takepart.com/article/2013/10/01/how-sign-obamacare-what-kind-plan-should-you-choose", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://www.takepart.com/sites/default/files/RTR3FHIE_obama-1.jpg", "height": 427}, "type": "article"}, "abstract": "With generous tax credits and a variety of coverage plans, there&#039;s something for any uninsured shopper.", "sailthru.date": "2013-10-01 16:51:37", "fb": {"admins": 1327833247, "pages": 9287842439, "app_id": 247137505296280}, "HandheldFriendly": "true", "keywords": "Social Justice", "MobileOptimized": 320, "sailthru.tags": "social-justice,obamacare,health-insurance,openpublish_article", "tab-keywords": "Social Justice, ObamaCare, Health Insurance", "twitter": {"description": "With generous tax credits and a variety of coverage plans, there&#039;s something for any uninsured shopper.", "creator": "@TakePart", "url": "http://www.takepart.com/article/2013/10/01/how-sign-obamacare-what-kind-plan-should-you-choose", "image": "http://www.takepart.com/sites/default/files/RTR3FHIE_obama-1.jpg", "title": "How to Sign Up For Obamacare: What Kind of Plan Should You Choose?", "site": "@TakePart", "card": "summary"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, height=device-height, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf00c\"", "article_summary": "He was able to maintain a plan through COBRA, but at a staggering $626 monthly premium.\nBut the tier\u2019s monthly premium fee, varying according to insurer, is the lowest.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re getting a fairly good tax credit subsidy, and you\u2019re older, then the higher plans are more generous,\u201d says Roby.\nA Silver tier plan for the same person would have a $500 medical deductible, but with a higher premium still lowered by tax credits.\nObamacare plans fit into four tiered categories: Bronze and Silver (which have low monthly premiums, higher deductibles), and Gold and Platinum (which have higher monthly premiums, no deductibles)."}
