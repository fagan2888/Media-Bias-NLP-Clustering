Massed together by the millions in the California Delta, the weeds become a smelly and dangerous mess. So California has brought in the Marines for its war on the water weeds. More exactly, a retired Marine colonel, Chris Conlin. He is the acting deputy director for the Division of Boating and Waterways and director of Off Highway Vehicle Recreation for the California Department of Parks and Recreation. He arrived just after the hyacinth and the seaweed-like egeria densa infestation began to accelerate in the Delta after the state failed to get permits in time to do proper weed-control spraying in 2011. The second day on the job, he says, he was out on a boat driving around the Delta looking at weeds as far south as Discovery Bay and around Frank\u0092s Tract. More recently he met with Stockton Mayor Anthony Silva who showed him the Port of Stockton and the downtown City Marina completely hemmed in with hyacinth all the way to the University Waterfront Hotel. Mr. Conlin retired from the Marines in 2011 after a career that began as an infantry officer and led to being a leader and trainer of Marines in both combat and peace times. One day he was talking to a friend, former Marine General Anthony Jackson who then was the California State Parks and Recreation Director. Mr. Conlin offered to help him if there was anything he could do. That led to Mr. Conlin being hired on a temporary basis for his present position until a permanent employee can be found. Mr. Conlin was shown a negative editorial cartoon from the Rio Vista Herald & Isleton Journal with caricatures of Governor Brown and himself standing in the \u0093Hyacinth State Park.\u0094 Mr. Conlin\u0092s shirt said, \u0093Conlin delay it, don\u0092t spray it,\u0094 like it was an order from Governor Brown, and the headline having Brown saying, \u0093Good work, Conlin. Soon the people will have no Delta to protect. Release the tunnels.\u0094 That cartoon captured the growing mood in the Delta that perhaps there is even a conspiracy on the part of Gov. Edmund Brown to let the hyacinth take over the Delta. After all, Mr. Brown has a history of using crises like the drought to sell his programs, such as Proposition 1 on November\u0092s ballot. Delta residents and business owners say he could use the hyacinth crises to better sell building his proposed 40-foot in diameter twin tunnels to suck fresh \u0093reliable\u0094 water southward to Southern California. Mr. Conlin denies there is any truth to this conspiracy theory. He added water hyacinth are a serious worldwide problem that has even been addressed by the United Nations. \u0093Yes, someone showed that (cartoon) to me,\u0094 said Mr. Conlin with a broad smile, while looking at the Rio Vista newspaper cartoon again. \u0093I\u0092m taking some hits on this but I\u0092m a Marine; this is not the worst and no one is shooting at me.\u0094 He said the bad smell associated with the plants is a result of the chemical spraying and the dying biomass until it drops to the bottom. \u0093We\u0092re not trying to delay anything,\u0094 he added. \u0093In fact we\u0092re trying to do absolutely the most we can do with all our resources to take care of the hyacinth problem. To date we\u0092ve done 2,430 water acres across the Delta just spraying specifically to the water hyacinth. Our budget went from $7.6 million to a little over $9 million this year for the aquatic evasive species because we\u0092re trying to keep up with the problem.\u0094 Mr. Conlin said that 20 years ago there was only one weed to control. \u0093Now we treat for not only the water hyacinth but other weeds as well,\u0094 saying new weeds are added constantly, making it a \u0093growth industry.\u0094 Mr. Conlin\u0092s friend and mentor, Mr. Jackson, retired June 30 just 18 months after pledging to reform Parks and Recreation following a scandal with hidden funds by his predecessor, Ruth Coleman. She was accused of stashing away $20 million in two special funds while planning to close 70 state parks to achieve budget cuts. This left Mr. Conlin in charge of the war on hyacinth until a permanent replacement can be found. With all this background since Boating and Waterways was merged into the Parks and Recreation Department, many boaters feel Mr. Brown has stolen their gas tax money and is not as effective as the agency was when it was more independent and solely devoted to boaters\u0092 needs and projects. \u0093Some signs of success\u0094 Mr. Conlin said there are signs of some success with the past spraying. He said anyone could see when the flowers on the plant that contain seeds are gone. This kills the life cycle, he said. Mr. Conlin added, although regulations limit the spraying from March to the end of November, he said his efforts wouldn\u0092t stop then. \u0093We will just shift from spraying to looking at other methodologies like removal, mechanical harvesting and do a very detailed assessment with our federal partners to try and determine what our attack plan will be for the remaining hyacinth as well as for the next season of treatment starting in March.\u0094 He said state Sen. Cathleen Galgiani is planning a public hearing in Stockton Dec. 15 and more will be announced about that meeting soon. But there was an identical Senate Subcommittee on Invasive Species hearing held back on May 9, 2013 and the problem has gotten worse since then. Delta marinas, waterfront restaurants, yacht dealers, boat owners, and many others are growing impatient and sad as they watch the Delta choked and dying visibly wherever they go. Port of Stockton Director Richard Asthieris wants everyone to know it is not true that ocean cargo liners bring in the hyacinth, because hyacinth can\u0092t exist in salt water. \u0093I\u0092m hoping our leaders will realize the significance of this problem,\u0094 said Mr. Asthieris. How did Mr. Conlin bring himself up to speed for this immense problem when he stepped into this Sacramento hot seat position? \u0093Like anything else, there was a lot of reliance on the duty experts,\u0094 said Mr. Conlin. \u0093There were experts already in the division. We have aquatic weed specialists within the Aquatic Evasive Seeds Section of Boating & Waterways. Some have been working on this problem for several years out there spraying the waterways or evaluating the issue. We already have a very close and productive partnership with UC Davis, the U.S. Department of Agriculture\u0092s Invasive Species Department, and NASA, NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration), U.S. Fish & Wildlife, as well as the California Fish & Wildlife. He said NASA is doing a multi-spectral analysis of the hyacinth. This imaging by satellites can allow extraction of additional information the human eye fails to capture with its receptors for red, green and blue. \u0093We also work with folks like the Department of Water Resources and Department of Agriculture to make sure we\u0092re doing the right stuff,\u0094 he said. He repeated the same goes with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the Coast Guard. Chemicals used to spray hyacinth include 2, 4-D (a common systemic herbicide) and glyphosate. \u00932, 4-D is a pretty good chemical to use against hyacinth but it is a pretty strong chemical,\u0094 Mr. Conlon said. \u0093We are limited in the amount of time we can use that \u0097 from about June to September, based on a biological opinion we received form U.S. Fish & Wildlife, NOAA, and USDA. The reason for limiting that, besides pesticide permits from the state, is there are a lot of concerns about migrating fish and potentially polluting the water. We have to be very careful in the amounts we use and the time we use it. There are strict limitations. \u0093The other chemical, glyphosate, can be used from March through the end of November. It is a good chemical but, quite honestly, the marine version is what you use in your backyard: Roundup. Just like the Roundup in your backyard, it is applied and takes about a week to have any effect on the weeds. It can take up to two weeks for the full effect of the chemical for the hyacinth to die. So it is about a three-week process to see a complete death of the plant.\u0094 Nature imposes its own restrictions Also, this spray is also only good in 60-80 degree conditions, he said. \u0093Because we have a limited time for spraying from March through November, we basically go all hands on deck for spraying. That is completely our focus because that is the best way to control the weed,\u0094 Mr. Conlin said. \u0093By control what we mean is the chemicals on the plant stops or stunts the growth. The bigger issue is to stop the life cycle so it doesn\u0092t produce flowers that produce the seeds that contributes to more hyacinth the next season.\u0094 Mr. Conlin said his department\u0092s crews sprayed from sunrise to mid-afternoon on work days since March but \u0093there are limitations to the amount of days we can spray or even the percentage of the weeds where the water is less mobile. In stagnant areas or sloughs we can only spray 30 percent of the time. \u0093Where water is faster moving, we have protocol for how long we have to wait until we can do a re-spray. Once that period is over than we start looking at other options. That includes mechanical harvesting and removal \u0097 even hand picking in some cases.\u0094 Mr. Conlin that the closer the environmental conditions are to the plant\u0092s original home in the Amazon, the more it thrives. The warm weather and some decreased water flows where sunlight hits seeds in the river more directly now contribute to the hyacinth growth, he said. \u0093And we\u0092re not seeing the early winter freezes like most years. That\u0092s also hurting us because that\u0092s the best way to stop it. The weed naturally dies much more effectively then than with chemicals,\u0094 he said. The USDA Weighs In Mr. Conlin said the Department of Agriculture was asked to do a study of the Delta hyacinth problem and got $750,000 as the first year of a potentially five year study for the Delta. \u0093This is good news for us,\u0094 he said. \u0093We\u0092re a big supporter of this and are doing everything from a state level to assure the program continues. This isn\u0092t a silver bullet but what it will do is look at the problem more holistically instead of us going out and just simply spraying. Instead of the Port of Stockton having to contract for mechanical harvesting in the Port, this study will look at all the causes and reasons for the proliferation of aquatic species in the Delta. \u0093That includes high nutrient levels,\u0094 he said. \u0093The water is next to farms, which are the mainstay, but there might be ways we can decrease those nutrients and how we handle the water runoff. NASA will help us pinpoint where the weeds are coming from. USDA will look at other options including biologicals.\u0094 He said before the drought the Boating and Waterways division tried using weevils like the beetle types used in West Africa that saved them $260 million over 20 years, according to an article in New Scientist written by James Randerson. \u0093Harvesting of the weed has proved futile because it grows so fast,\u0094 wrote Mr. Randerson. \u0093In the late 1980s, Nigeria spent $1.75 million on machinery to chew up the plants, without making any impact. Pesticides are another option, but they pollute the water and kill other plants. \u0093The most effective weapons, though, have been the weevils Neochetina eichhorniae and N. bruchi, which eat water hyacinth and nothing else. Setting them onto the weed can cut coverage by up to 90 per cent. The beasts were first introduced to Sudan, but have now been deployed across Africa.\u0094 Mr. Conlin said the experiment in the Delta resulted in limited success. \u0093It doesn\u0092t completely eradicate it but they help,\u0094 he said. \u0093The problem is, when winter came with the first freeze, the weevils would die and you would be stuck with a bunch of dead bugs and have to start all over again. With the drought and the temperatures moderating, we\u0092re going to try it again to see how that works. \u0093I will tell you that when we look at the Delta, the hyacinth is a problem and we\u0092re working as hard as we can to solve it,\u0094 he said. Mr. Conlin\u0092s biggest fear is that the only success anyone has ever had with totally eradicating water hyacinth has been in closed water bodies where they completely drained the water and scraped the bottom. \u0093My guys are going to crunch the data and create a better plan that will start the beginning of March,\u0094 said Mr. Conlin. He said he looks forward to meeting more people from the Delta.
