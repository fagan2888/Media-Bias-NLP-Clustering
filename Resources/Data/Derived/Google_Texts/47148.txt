NEW YORK (CBSNewYork) — Some New York City hospitals are about to lose federal funds for failing to protect patient infections.

As WCBS 880’s Monica Miller reported, Lenox Hill, NYU Langone and Montefiore are among the 17 hospitals being penalized millions of dollars by Medicare.

They were graded on a scale of one to 10 for their prevention of complications such as bed sores, collapsed lungs and blood infections caused by tubes inserted into patients.

Kings County Hospital and Brookdale University Hospital and Medical Center scored the worst.

The Affordable Care Act requires financial penalties for hospitals that perform poorly.
