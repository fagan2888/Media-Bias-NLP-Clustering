Agence France-Presse/Getty Images\n\nGuinea has been more successful in containing the Ebola epidemic than its immediate neighbors in West Africa, but the loss of revenue caused by the crisis has left the country in dire financial straits, President Alpha Cond\u00e9 said after concluding a round of meetings at the United Nations General Assembly.\n\nMr. Cond\u00e9 said Guinea would need about $100 million until December to cover its budget gap, which will grow if Ebola is not tackled by the end of the year.\n\n\u201cThe slowing down of our economies due to Ebola requires that most of our countries get some budgetary support \u2026 it\u2019s going to be crucial that we get that support so our economies don\u2019t completely collapse,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Cond\u00e9\u2019s statements followed an announcement by the International Monetary Fund that it had approved a $130 million expansion of zero-interest loans that would be divided among Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia, the West African nations hit hardest by the Ebola crisis.\n\nAccording to the World Health Organization, Guinea is faring slightly better than its neighbors. The organization has said that the country has seemingly been able to stabilize the rate of the infection.\n\nLast week, the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said that in a worst-case-scenario as many as half a million to 1.4 million people could be infected by mid-January in Liberia and Sierra Leone.\n\nMr. Cond\u00e9 said the deteriorating situation in the neighboring countries must be viewed in context of the civil wars that left the health infrastructure of both Sierra Leone and Liberia in tatters.\n\n\u201cThey are not to blame,\u201d said Mr. Cond\u00e9.\n\nDespite the inroads made in stabilizing the Ebola epidemic, Guinea\u2019s economy has been affected.\n\nAccording to the World Bank, the country\u2019s GDP was $ 6.2 billion last year and its economy was projected to grow 4.6 % percent this year.\n\nMr. Cond\u00e9 said that the outbreak has already shaved off 2.5 percentage points from its expected GDP growth since March of this year as the tourism industry and $30 billion worth of mining and infrastructure construction has ground to a halt.\n\nThe various projects were scheduled to begin this year and be concluded by 2018.\n\nIn May Guinea approved the $20 billion Simandou South project\u2014touted as the largest mining and infrastructure project in Africa, involving Rio Tinto, Chinalco and the IFC. Construction on a new railway and port have now been delayed because of the epidemic.\n\nGuinea is home to one of the world\u2019s largest deposits of bauxite, which is used to produce aluminum. It is also has gold, diamonds and iron-ore deposits.\n\nAt the UN Mr. Cond\u00e9 urged world leaders to deploy a speedy relief effort and received reassurances of support from the World Bank President Jim Yong Kim\u2014an American physician with experience in dealing with infectious diseases.\n\n\u201cI am on a very personal level with him. We are going to find the resources that we need, \u201c said Mr. Kim following a meeting with Mr. Cond\u00e9.\n\nMr. Cond\u00e9 remained optimistic that if everything that was decided at the UN were to be implemented in the next two weeks Ebola in West Africa could be defeated.\n\n\u201cThe world has known many epidemics \u2026 that have affected the west and yet Europe is still around, so Africa too will beat this. But we need to act now,\u201d he said.\n\nWrite to Neanda Salvaterra at neanda.salvaterra@wsj.com.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "The loss of revenue caused by the Ebola crisis has left Guinea in dire financial straits, the country's President, Alpha Cond\u00e9, says.", "title": "Ebola Could Cause \u2018Economic Collapse\u2019 Guinea\u2019s President Warns", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/frontiers/2014/10/01/ebola-could-cause-economic-collapse-guineas-president-warns/", "image": {"src": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-EU556_fronti_P_20141001111019.jpg"}, "site": "frontiermarkets", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Markets", "article.headline": "Ebola Could Cause \u2018Economic Collapse\u2019 Guinea\u2019s President Warns", "description": "The loss of revenue caused by the Ebola crisis has left Guinea in dire financial straits, the country's President, Alpha Cond\u00e9, says.", "article_section": "Markets", "author": "Neanda Salvaterra", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "Frontier Markets Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "Frontier Markets", "article.summary": "The loss of revenue caused by the Ebola crisis has left Guinea in dire financial straits, the country's President, Alpha Cond\u00e9, says.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2014-10-01T15:21:06-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-158", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/frontiers/2014/10/01/ebola-could-cause-economic-collapse-guineas-president-warns/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-265B-1217", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Markets", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "The loss of revenue caused by the Ebola crisis has left Guinea in dire financial straits, the country's President, Alpha Cond\u00e9, says.", "title": "Ebola Could Cause \u2018Economic Collapse\u2019 Guinea\u2019s President Warns", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/frontiers/2014/10/01/ebola-could-cause-economic-collapse-guineas-president-warns/", "image": {"width": 749, "identifier": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-EU556_fronti_P_20141001111019.jpg", "height": 499}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Frontier Markets", "article.id": "BL-265B-1217", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2014-10-08T15:45:30-04:00"}, "article_summary": "We are going to find the resources that we need, \u201c said Mr. Kim following a meeting with Mr. Cond\u00e9.\n\u201cThey are not to blame,\u201d said Mr. Cond\u00e9.\nMr. Cond\u00e9 remained optimistic that if everything that was decided at the UN were to be implemented in the next two weeks Ebola in West Africa could be defeated.\nMr. Cond\u00e9 said Guinea would need about $100 million until December to cover its budget gap, which will grow if Ebola is not tackled by the end of the year.\nDespite the inroads made in stabilizing the Ebola epidemic, Guinea\u2019s economy has been affected."}
