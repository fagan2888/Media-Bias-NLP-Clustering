SXSW Badgeholders entered a special lottery to win tickets. The crowd also included invited guests, media, technology industry leaders and politicians.\n\nDuring an hour long talk, Smith and Obama talked about civic engagement and ways to improve the government through collaboration with the technology industry.\n\n\u201cPart of my challenge since I\u2019ve been President is trying to find ways in which our government can be a part of the positive change that is taking place and can help convene and catalyze folks in the private sector and nonprofit sector to be part of the broader civic community in tackling some of our biggest challenges,\u201d Obama said.\n\nPresident Obama said his administration is \u201cspending a lot of time trying to figure out how to make government work better in digital platforms.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe reason I\u2019m here really is to recruit all of you,\u201d Obama said. \u201cIt\u2019s to say to you as I\u2019m about to leave office how can we start coming up with new platforms, new ideas, new approaches across disciplines and across skill sets to solve some of the big problems we\u2019re facing today.\u201d\n\nSmith pointed out that the culture of tech and government are totally different.\n\n\u201cGovernment is big and bloated and slow and risk averse.\u201d Smith said. \u201cIt\u2019s run on outmoded systems and outmoded equipment. Tech is sleek and streamlined and fail fast and enamored of the new and the shiny. How do you take these two things that seem culturally unlike and put them together in a way that they can and want to work together.\u201d\n\nObama talked about enlisting the best and the brightest technology experts in the private sector to fix the website for enrollment in the Affordable Care Act. As a result, his administration built a world class technology office inside the government called U.S. Digital Services. It now has top talent from Google, Facebook and all the top tech companies working for the government. In some cases, they work six months and in others two years, he said.\n\nThey are working to update \u201cagencies like the Small Business Administration that has been a bit clunky is redesigning itself so if an entrepreneur wants to startup a business in Texas they can go to one spot and within a day they can handle all the regulatory red tape that used to take months to navigate,\u201d Obama said.\n\nIn Austin, Obama also met with entrepreneurs, movie makers, organizers, tech leaders to figure out ways to make a real difference in countering violent extremism. He wants government to work with the private sector and nonprofits to solve big problems.\n\nObama also wants to make it easier for people to vote.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re the only advanced Democracy in the world that makes it harder for people to vote,\u201d Obama said. \u201cYou are laughing but it is sad. We take enormous pride in that we\u2019re the world\u2019s oldest continuous Democracy and yet we systematically put up barriers and make it as hard as possible for our citizens to vote.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s easier to order a pizza online or book a trip than to vote, he said.\n\nSmith pointed out that Texas has one of the worst records for voter turnout in the country and Texas doesn\u2019t even let its residents register to vote online.\n\n\u201cThe folks who are currently governing the good state of Texas aren\u2019t interested in having more people participate,\u201d Obama said. Citizens need to make a political argument about why it is important, he said.\n\nObama also said that people like to complain about the government but the government does great things. It creates satellites that provide information to weather apps, it builds roads and highways and tackles some of society\u2019s toughest problems like educating poor kids, providing shelter to homeless people and providing care to aging veterans.\n\n\u201cPart of our task is to tell a better story about what government does,\u201d Obama said.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "SiliconHills", "title": "President Obama Wants the Tech Industry and Government to Collaborate Even More - SiliconHills", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://www.SILICONHILLSNEWS.COM/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/PresidentObama-1-300x300.png", "url": "http://www.siliconhillsnews.com/2016/03/13/president-obama-wants-the-tech-industry-and-government-to-collaborate-even-more/", "type": "article"}, "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2882\"", "article_summary": "\u201cWe\u2019re the only advanced Democracy in the world that makes it harder for people to vote,\u201d Obama said.\nDuring an hour long talk, Smith and Obama talked about civic engagement and ways to improve the government through collaboration with the technology industry.\nOn Friday, Texas Tribune Editor in Chief Evan Smith interviewed President Obama at the Long Center before a crowd of more than 2,000 people.\nObama also wants to make it easier for people to vote.\nIn Austin, Obama also met with entrepreneurs, movie makers, organizers, tech leaders to figure out ways to make a real difference in countering violent extremism."}
