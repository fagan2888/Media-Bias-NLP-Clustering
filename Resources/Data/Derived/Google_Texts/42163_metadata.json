Juding from my Twitter feed, many Hayes fans (who call themseles #inners) are not happy that Ben is a frequent guest. But Hayes picks him because he\u2019s good.\n\nBen points out that the Tea Party faction, both in Congress and among he people, \u201cnever really trusted the Republican establishment or the leadership in the House to actually fight the fight\u201d against Obamacare or stand strong against raising the debt limit. \u201cThe reason you got to this point,\u201d Ben continued, \u201cis that you had, essentially, on one side a plan being advocated by Ted Cruz and people of his persuasion, and then you had leadership sort of saying, \u2018Well, don\u2019t do that,\u2019 without offering them an alternative.\u201d\n\nChris Hayes says that the Tea Party faction and right-wing activists are \u201clying\u201d to the American people and the Republican leadership in Washington.
