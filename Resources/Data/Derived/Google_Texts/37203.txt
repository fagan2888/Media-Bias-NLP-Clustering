LOS ANGELES (AP) — It’s a meet-and-greet worthy of an A-list star.

Outside the three-story bookstore at the outdoor shopping mecca known as The Grove, hundreds of mostly young women have formed a line that stretches past trendy clothing stores and spills out onto a nearby street. They’re waiting to have Connor Franta, an affable 22-year-old Internet personality best known for delivering diary-like monologues on YouTube, sign a copy of his new memoir.

The irony of a YouTube star drawing a massive crowd at a bookstore isn’t lost on talent manager Andrew Graham.

“A year ago, I went to New York and tried to get a book publisher to take a meeting with me,” said Graham, who represents Franta and other mega-popular YouTubers. “I had one meeting, and they laughed at me. Here we are a year later at Barnes & Noble in Los Angeles with a New York Times best-selling author who is a client. I think that says it all. It’s a 180-degree turn.”

Franta isn’t a singer, chef, comedian or athlete. He’s a YouTube star angling to be the Oprah Winfrey for millennials.

In its 10-years of existence, YouTube has evolved from a playground for kitty videos to a $20 billion visual menagerie. Along the way, it’s also become an incubator for a new type of celebrity — a digital Brat Pack that’s leveraging smartphone stardom to write books, drop albums, design products and break into Hollywood.

“It’s the most powerful marketing platform in the world for millennials,” said Graham. “If you’re trying to reach that audience of girls gathered downstairs, YouTube is the venue to do that. Look at an artist like Fred (Lucas Cruikshank). He went off to Hollywood, created some films, neglected his channel, came back to YouTube and … crickets. No one was there anymore. You can’t abandon it.”

In recent years, YouTube, which is celebrating its 10th anniversary this month, has propped up YouTubers like Franta — “creators,” the site calls them — who attract millions of subscribers that regularly watch their online videos and the advertising attached to them.

Their popularity is still eclipsed by music videos, which continue to account for YouTube’s most watched clips. Yet the fandom that creators are inspiring, and the ad revenue they’re bringing in, can’t be ignored.

With his playful grin and doe eyes, Franta currently boasts more than 4.4 million devotees to his personal YouTube channel, where he speaks to viewers about life, dating, candy, whatever at least once a week. He began posting videos in 2010 while still attending high school in La Crescent, Minnesota. Now, he’s releasing music compilations and a line of locally grown coffee.

For every Justin Bieber or Psy, perhaps YouTube’s biggest success stories, there are dozens of Frantas. It’s a form of celebrity that didn’t exist 10 years ago, when YouTube was born and made it simple to post video online. Franta, who continues to upload videos despite his other endeavors, is young enough to have been inspired by the YouTube vloggers that came before him.
