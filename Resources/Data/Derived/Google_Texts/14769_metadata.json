The suit was settled \u201cvery amicably,\u201d he added.\n\nThe Times article also details Freddy Trump\u2019s struggles trying his hand at the family real estate business. He helped his father build Trump Village in the 1960s but was berated for installing expensive new windows instead of repairing old ones, according to the Times.\n\nWhen he left real estate to become a pilot, Donald Trump gave his brother a hard time and told him to come back to the family business.\n\n\u201cI was too young; I didn\u2019t realize,\u201d he told the Times. \u201cNow I give speeches on success, and I tell people, \u2018You\u2019ve got to love what you\u2019re doing.\u2019\u201d\n\nTrump also said he has never tried alcohol or cigarettes because of his brother\u2019s struggles.\n\nWhen asked whether he thinks his brother\u2019s drinking was caused in part by his bad experience with the family business, Donald Trump responded: \u201cI hope not.
