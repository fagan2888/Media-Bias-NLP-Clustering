The Middle East does it differently.\n\nAmid the ongoing Sunni-Shiite wars, on the eve of April Fools\u2019 Day, an audio recording was circulated online of the man who presides over the holiest site for Muslim around the world. The caption on photo accompanying the recording read, \u201cImam of the grand mosque in Mecca calls for all-out war against Shiites.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur war with Iran, say that out loud, is a war between Sunnis and Shiites,\u201d Sunni preacher Abdul Rahman al-Sudais says in the nearly seven-minute clip. \u201cOur war with Iran...is truly sectarian. If it was not sectarian, we will make it sectarian... The Jews and cross\u201d \u2013 meaning Christians \u2013 \u201cI swear by Allah that they will have their days...The prophet said that Rome will be conquered ...Our disagreement with Rafidha\u201d \u2013 another word for Shiites \u2013 \u201cwill not be removed, nor our suicide to fight them... as long as they are on the face of the earth....\u201d\n\nRelated: ISIS\u2019s 10 Most Extreme Acts of Terror\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\n\nWhile cursing Jews is part of Friday prayers and speeches in many parts of the Islamic world, most Muslim imams avoid calling for all-out war with Shiites and Christians. Hearing that call from al-Sudais in the grand mosque in Mecca is an unprecedented escalation of hate speech (though, for what it\u2019s worth, Al-Sudais' page on Facebook didn't confirm his alleged comments).\n\n\u201cRemember the date of 3/31/2015, the day the Shiite-Sunni war was announced. It will last more than the crusade wars,\u201d said Ahmed Abul Hussein, the secular editor-in-chief of an Iraqi news agency, about the cleric\u2019s speech.\n\nOn the same day as the imam made his call, Asharq al-Awsat, a prominent London-based and Saudi-funded Arabic language newspaper, published a story stating that Egyptian and Iranian battleships exchanged fire while trying to control the strategically important Bab el-Mandeb strait between Yemen and Africa.\n\nRelated: The Knights Templar Shows How to Fight ISIS and Win\n\nIt may look like the imam\u2019s call was late and the entire Middle East is already on fire in a sectarian religious war. But the real picture is somewhat messier. The Sunni rebels in Syria are fighting ISIS as well as the Syrian government, which is hardly Shiite. The Iraqi government forces that are fighting in Tikrit have Sunni allies on the ground. Both the Iranians and Egyptians denied the battleship confrontation.\n\nApril Fool\u2019s Day brought some other interesting news in the region. One headline suggested that all three Iraqi vice presidents \u2014 none of them has any real function \u2014 resigned to save money in a time of financial hardship. Another headline reported that ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi has married a German girl in Mosul. Both items might have come across as April Fools\u2019 Day pranks, but they were apparently no joke. It is, after all, the Middle East, where things are only getting more serious.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Most parts of the world celebrate April Fools' Day with humor and laughter.", "title": "Muslim Cleric Calls for \u2018All-Out War\u2019", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/04/02/Muslim-Cleric-Calls-All-Out-War", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/04022015_Tikrit.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/04/02/Muslim-Cleric-Calls-All-Out-War", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/04022015_Tikrit.jpg", "creator": "@AlhamdaniRiyadh", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Most parts of the world celebrate April Fools' Day with humor and laughter.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd231f\"", "article_summary": "The caption on photo accompanying the recording read, \u201cImam of the grand mosque in Mecca calls for all-out war against Shiites.\u201d\u201cOur war with Iran, say that out loud, is a war between Sunnis and Shiites,\u201d Sunni preacher Abdul Rahman al-Sudais says in the nearly seven-minute clip.\nBoth items might have come across as April Fools\u2019 Day pranks, but they were apparently no joke.\nApril Fool\u2019s Day brought some other interesting news in the region.\nMost parts of the world celebrate April Fools' Day with humor and laughter.\nAmid the ongoing Sunni-Shiite wars, on the eve of April Fools\u2019 Day, an audio recording was circulated online of the man who presides over the holiest site for Muslim around the world."}
