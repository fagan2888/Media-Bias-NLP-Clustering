Paul Patton.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t mean to be dismissive Jack, but some of these things that you were a part of, you were 22, 23 years old,\u201d Bevin said. \u201cYou were right out of school in your first political job, you really were not critically involved.\u201d\n\nConway fired back that while he was young, he was an important part of Patton\u2019s team.\n\n\u201cI was 26, 27, 28, 29 years old,\u201d Conway said. \u201cBut I was here. I brought my education back to the state \u2026 there are a lot of reporters that are here in this room that were there with me and I think they know that that experience was real.\n\n\u201cWas that education you\u2019re talking about a Duke education,\u201d Bevin shot back, mentioning where Conway attended law school \u2014 a school roundly hated by many University of Kentucky basketball fans.\n\n\u201cAt least I tell the truth about where I went to college,\u201d Conway replied, an allusion to charges by U.S. Sen. Mitch McConnell\u2019s campaign in 2014 that Bevin lied on a Linkedin resume by claiming that he attended the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\n\nIn fact, newspaper stories from the time show that Conway was one of the lawyers who drafted Patton\u2019s higher education reform bill, headed a task force on saving Paducah\u2019s Gaseous Diffusion Plant, served as Patton\u2019s liaison to the utility industry and played a key role in Patton\u2019s plan to extend universal garbage collection to every county.\n\nThe discussion at the Kentucky Chamber of Commerce\u2019s Business Summit touched on numerous issues ranging from education to health care to job development and the candidates differed greatly on many of them.\n\nOn early childhood education, Conway said he would try to find the money necessary to extend early childhood education programs to children whose parents earn up to 138 percent of the poverty level while Bevin questioned programs such as head start and said the state should focus on improving underperforming schools.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s start with our failing schools,\u201d said Bevin, who has been critical of the federal Head Start program, which he said scientific studies show isn\u2019t effective. \u201cLet\u2019s start in those communities where we now have multiple generations of academic failure.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re science is wrong,\u201d said Conway, who said the program is effective in teaching children at an age when their brain is forming the connections that will help them learn.\n\nConway criticized Bevin\u2019s stance on Common Core academic standards, saying that Common Core \u201cis not a federal takeover of education.\u201d\n\nThe standards were created by the National Governor\u2019s Association and adopted by many states. Later, the federal government began tying federal funding to adoption of the standards.\n\nBevin questioned Conway\u2019s portrayal of his position on Common Core, saying, \u201cI don\u2019t know who the people are who are saying it is a takeover by the federal government,\u201d he said.\n\nBevin reiterated that on health care, he would get rid of the kynect health insurance marketplace where people can purchase coverage offered through the Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare, and move them to the federal health insurance exchange.\n\n\u201cWe will shut down the duplicity because we don\u2019t need to pay twice for the same thing,\u201d Bevin said. \u201cThere is no financial advantage.\u201d\n\nConway, however, argued that getting rid of kynect and moving people to the federal exchange would actually cost Kentuckians money because they would have to pay higher government fees. (The Kynect website, the state exchange requires people to pay fees equal to 1 percent of their premiums while the federal exchange charges a 3.5 percent fee.\u201d\n\nBevin suggested that one really doesn\u2019t know what the costs are.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re saying 1 percent, but I\u2019m telling you, I would like to see a true apples to apples comparison before we\u2019re making an assumption about whether we\u2019re really saving money,\u201d he said.\n\nOn Medicaid, Bevin argued that he wouldn\u2019t toss nearly 500,000 off the new expanded Medicaid rolls immediately once he took office, as Conway claimed he would.\n\nSome 430,000 people have signed up for Medicaid in Kentucky since 2014, when Gov. Steve Beshear allowed people who earn up to 138 percent of the poverty level to qualify for it.\n\nReporter Joseph Gerth can be reached at (502) 582-4702.
