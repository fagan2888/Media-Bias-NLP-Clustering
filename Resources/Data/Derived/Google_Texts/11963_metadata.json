Angel Hernansaez, CC BY-ND 2.0\n\nDiabetic patients may find relief from their high blood glucose levels, and the overweight from their obesity, through a natural sweetener in the agave plant, a new study finds.\n\nKnown as agavins, the plant-based sweeteners slow the stomach from emptying, boosting insulin production. They\u2019re also non-digestible, which means they act as a dietary fiber but can\u2019t elevate a person\u2019s blood sugar. While this inability to be broken down means some people\u2019s digestive systems can\u2019t tolerate the sweetener, researchers are confident it can stimulate the growth of healthy microbes in the mouth and intestine.\n\nThe research team presented their findings on Sunday at the American Chemical Society\u2019s 247th National Meeting, in Dallas. They found that, while agavins aren\u2019t nearly as sweet as their artificial counterparts, they do a proficient job of reducing glucose levels in the blood. More hopefully, \u201cagavins are not expensive and they have no known side effects, except for those few people who cannot tolerate them,\u201d explained Dr. Mercedes G. L\u00f3pez, a researcher at the Centro de Investigaci\u00f3n y de Estudios Avanzados in Guanajuato, Mexico.\n\nL\u00f3pez and her colleagues tested agavins on mice as part of their normal diet. By and large, the mice that were given the sweetener ate less, lost weight, and showed lower blood glucose levels than both the control mice and those fed other sweeteners, such as sucrose, fructose, glucose, aspartame, and agave syrup. Future studies will need to show whether this success translates into human models.\n\nOne thing L\u00f3pez emphasized at the conference was the difference between agavins and high-fructose corn syrup \u2014 the 21st century agro-enemy that\u2019s often found as a substitute for good old-fashioned sugar. Agavins do contain fructose, she concedes, but in a form that prevents the body from breaking it down. The fructose molecule is actually bound in a long chain, known as a polymer, into a new substance called fructan. It\u2019s these chains that baffle the body, preventing it from turning fructan into blood sugar.\n\nAnother disclaimer: agavins are only one component of tequila, the popular alcohol byproduct of fermented agave plant as it\u2019s turned into ethanol. Agavins contribute to the carbohydrate component, L\u00f3pez says, and it\u2019s only after the agave pines are cooked that the fructose and glucose turns into alcohol. (In other words, you won\u2019t find any dietary relief from tequila shots, so don\u2019t try it.)\n\nDeveloping alternative sweeteners is a decidedly large undertaking with even larger implications. More than a third of the U.S. population is obese, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. And a portion of the some 26.2 million people with type 2 diabetes overlaps with that group.\n\nHigh-fructose corn syrup is regularly targeted as a major contributor to cardiovascular disease, obesity, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and yours truly, diabetes. Critics widely denounce HFCS as being unhealthier than regular sugar, although the Food and Drug Administration has classified it as safe since 1976.\n\nIn her previous research, L\u00f3pez has found that agavins have prebiotic effects and are able to lower cholesterol and triglycerides, while raising levels of the beneficial probiotics lactobacillus and lactobifidus. The current study is but the first, she says, to consider agavins as an alternative sweetener in an otherwise HFCS-dominated landscape. \"This study represents the first attempt to evaluate agavins as sweeteners,\u201d she said, \u201cin spite of their lower sweetness compared to sugar.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "diabetes, type 2 diabetes, tequila for diabetes, tequila plant agavins, tequila plant diabetes, agavins diabetes, agave plant diabetes", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Diabetes patients and the obese could find relief in a sweetener drawn from agave, the plant routinely used to make tequila.", "title": "What Tequila And Diabetes Have In Common", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/tequila-diabetes-agave-plant-sweetener-cuts-blood-sugar-levels-and-fuels-weight-loss-271366", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/03/17/agave.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Diabetes patients and the obese could find relief in a sweetener drawn from agave, the plant routinely used to make tequila.", "title": "What Tequila And Diabetes Have In Common", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/tequila-diabetes-agave-plant-sweetener-cuts-blood-sugar-levels-and-fuels-weight-loss-271366", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/03/17/agave.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/03/17/agave.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Conditions", "published_time": "2014-03-17T10:25:11-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-03-17T10:31:19-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Diabetes patients and the obese could find relief in a sweetener drawn from agave, the plant routinely used to make tequila."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9d9e\"", "article_summary": "They\u2019re also non-digestible, which means they act as a dietary fiber but can\u2019t elevate a person\u2019s blood sugar.\nDiabetes patients and the obese could find relief in a sweetener drawn from agave, the plant routinely used to make tequila.\nIt\u2019s these chains that baffle the body, preventing it from turning fructan into blood sugar.\nAnother disclaimer: agavins are only one component of tequila, the popular alcohol byproduct of fermented agave plant as it\u2019s turned into ethanol.\nAngel Hernansaez, CC BY-ND 2.0Diabetic patients may find relief from their high blood glucose levels, and the overweight from their obesity, through a natural sweetener in the agave plant, a new study finds."}
