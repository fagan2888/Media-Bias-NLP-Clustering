Continuing on, she stated, \u201cI love to laugh and carry on, but when the topic comes to my family and the heartbreak I am facing right now with my dying folks \u2013 I just can\u2019t go there.\u201d\n\nMy response? I must laugh.\u201d\u00a8\u201d\u00a8Laughter is like a muscle I work \u2013 and practice every day. For years, I used humor as a defense mechanism to push back against the heartache and fear as I helped my wife through 78 operations. With the help of others, however, I\u2019ve learned to laugh and have joy from a healthier place in my heart. Although my wife lives with extreme circumstances, I\u2019ve discovered it is inappropriate to wait for her to get better or worse before I live a healthy life \u2013 emotionally, physically, financially and professionally.\n\nUnhealthy caregivers make lousy caregivers.\n\nAs the conversation continued, the woman broke down into sobs while relating the intense pressures of being an only child with elderly and chronically ill parents. I listened as she struggled to make sense of her new life as a caregiver. After a few minutes the conversation lightened somewhat, and I evidently quipped something funny, and she burst out laughing. \u201cSee,\u201d I exclaimed to her, \u201cYou still have tears on your cheeks, but you are laughing as well \u2013 and it\u2019s OK!\u201d\u201d\u00a8\u201d\u00a8 We all know we\u2019re permitted to cry, but we can laugh as well \u2013 and we can do it from a healthy place in our hearts.\n\nClowning around one day while speaking about the subject of caregivers, I did my best Jeff Foxworthy imitation and delivered a one-liner of, \u201cIf you have a professional carpet cleaner on retainer \u2013 you might be a caregiver.\u201d\u201d\u00a8\u201d\u00a8 Friends agreed it was funny and said, \u201cYou and Jeff ought to do some of those \u2013 it would really connect with folks.\u201d\n\nJeff and his wife have been dear friends to my family for many years. During particularly rough patches, I can recall numerous long phone calls, some tears and a lot a love and laughter that they have offered \u2013 in order to help me as I sought to provide leadership to my family through what most call a medical nightmare.\n\nWhen I launched my radio show for caregivers on Nashville\u2019s WLAC, it was Jeff who told me, \u201cMake \u2019em laugh, Peter.\u201d He added, \u201cYou know more than most how hard this is, and they need someone they can trust to give them permission to lay down their burdens for just a bit \u2013 and lighten their hearts.\u201d\n\n>> Get discounts on health products and services with your AARP Member Advantages.\n\nWith AARP\u2019s help, Jeff and I got together to offer a little humor, love and support to let my fellow caregivers know that they are not alone \u2013 and that help is available. Drawing upon AARP\u2019s desire to offer practical help, encouragement and community, we saw this as a real opportunity to reach out to hurting hearts during November\u2019s National Family Caregivers Month.\n\nWe caregivers can easily get bogged down in what I call the Three I\u2019s:\n\nWe lose our independence;\n\nWe lose our identity;\n\nWe become isolated.\n\nBecause we\u2019re often cut off from our normal social circle and enmeshed in the lives of the ones we\u2019re caring for, it\u2019s hard to step back and get a healthier view \u2013 and laugh at the absurdities we deal with every day.\n\nTaking on that isolation factor, we wanted to let others know that although it is a lonely walk, they are not alone.
