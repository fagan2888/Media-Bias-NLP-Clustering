It was a cold evening in Buenos Aires, Argentina on Saturday night but that didn't cool down Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band in their second show in three nights in South America.

Bruce and the band rocked the Estadio G.E.B.A., an 18,000 seat outdoor stadium with a 30-song, three-hour-and-17-minute show.

It was 48 degrees at showtime according to my friend Mitch.

"It's very crowded up front, there is tons of energy," Mitch texted. "The pit is split into two sides."

Bruce played 10 different songs from Thursday's show in Santiago, Chile. "Cover Me" was played for a sign request.

"The solo on 'Cover Me' was searing," Mitch texted.

My friend Beverly Porway from North Jersey texted this when "Glory Days" was played during the encores:
