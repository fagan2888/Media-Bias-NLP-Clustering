In today’s edition of The Heartland Daily Podcast, we listen in as Heartland Senior Fellow Peter Ferrara joins the Mark Levin Show to discuss his new book, Power to the People: The New Road to Freedom and Prosperity for the Poor, Seniors, and Those Most in Need of the World’s Best Health Care.

In this new book, Ferrara illustrates the dire economic situation the country finds itself in. Government programs like obamacare, medicare, medicaid and social security are causing America’s debt to skyrocket. Ferrara explains how we can unleash the power of free markets to save and reform America’s entitlement system.

Power to the People gives a refreshing look at the spending crisis and offers a free-market solution to these problems. These solutions are commonsense and proven effective, which have led certain presidential candidates to explore the ideas. Some of the ideas are even currently being formed into legislation and being scored by the Chief Actuary of Social Security. “[Ferrara] is the Left’s greatest nightmare,” Levin states toward the end of the interview, “This is one of the leading lights on how to reform these programs and try to actually get it done.”
