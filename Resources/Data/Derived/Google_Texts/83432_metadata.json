Greece\u2019s only two goals so far at the tournament came in that decisive group game against the Ivorians. The second was a disputed late penalty.\n\nSo Santos promised \u201cwe will attack as much as possible\u201d against Costa Rica.\n\nEven then, he doesn\u2019t expect to change the minds of many Brazilians and said Greece can\u2019t be \u201churt by it.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf we had these past three games in this way, the next will probably be the same,\u201d he said. \u201cWe hope we can still achieve better results and perhaps in the next match they will still go against Greece. OK. And the next and the next, they will still go against Greece.
