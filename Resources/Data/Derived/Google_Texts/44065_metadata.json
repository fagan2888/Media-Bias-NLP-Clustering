The miniseries about pioneering sex researchers William Masters and Virginia Johnson shows us wired-up subjects giving their all for science, stroke by stroke, surging past taboos like Masters and Johnson did, climaxing in a heady new experience. Even for Showtime, it\u2019s breathtaking stuff \u2014 yet Allison Janney is convinced, \u201cThe public is going to embrace this, they\u2019re going to love it. It\u2019s going to be a huge show, just huge.\u201d\n\nFour-time Emmy winner Janney is part of a cast led by Michael Sheen (The Queen) and Lizzy Caplan (Mean Girls), who are both excellent, as Masters and Johnson. Beau Bridges plays Washington University Provost Barton Scully, a mentor of star obstetrics and gynecology faculty member Masters, who, as the series begins in 1956, is scared to death of Masters\u2019 probing of human sexuality. And why wouldn\u2019t he be? Watching women writhing around pleasuring themselves was a tough sell as laboratory research back then, to say the least.\n\nBridges and Janney play husband and wife, \u201cand our storyline \u2013 oh!\u201d enthuses the former The West Wing star. \u201cIt was so incredibly exciting to play this really difficult situation my character is in. It\u2019s really well-written, and the period, the costumes and hair \u2013 it was just extraordinary.\u201d\n\nThe series was developed and produced by Michelle Ashford, based on the book Masters of Sex: The Life and Times of William Masters and Virginia Johnson, the Couple Who Taught America How to Love, by Thomas Maier.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so sad that Virginia Johnson died before she could see a show that was inspired by her life\u2019s work,\u201d says Janney of the woman who began as Masters\u2019 assistant and, despite her lack of education and status as a divorced mother, wound up as his full research partner and, for two decades, his wife. Johnson died in July at age 88.\n\nJanney, who keeps turning in exemplary performances no matter what form of production she is in, is hoping that if Masters of Sex goes to a second season, she\u2019ll be doing both the Showtime series and her new Mom sitcom with Anna Faris. The show, from comedy mogul Chuck Lorre, has Faris as a recovering alcoholic and single mother revisiting the troubled relationship she has with her own recovering addict mother, Janney. With surprising moments of realism, it\u2019s won plaudits for both actresses. \u201cI love how my character just wants to be back in her daughter\u2019s life and her granddaughter\u2019s life. I think she is lonely. I think she is struggling with her own sobriety and wants very much to make amends, even though she is not quite willing to admit all the things she did wrong,\u201d Janney says.\n\nHer character is also \u201cdefinitely playing the field and doing the cougar thing a little bit, which is fun. I\u2019m going to have fun playing this lady.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"page_title": "blog", "twitter": {"description": "If you have any qualms about watching nudity, masturbation and copulation, Showtime\u2019s Masters of Sex, premiering tonight (9/29), is not for you.
