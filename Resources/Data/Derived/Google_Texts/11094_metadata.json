Some are so frustrated they are giving up on their life's work and leaving practice. This is all due to the massive hole in the medical education process. And it all can end now.\n\nDike Drummond MD, CEO of TheHappyMD.com, announces the release of his groundbreaking new book, \"Stop Physician Burnout \u2013 What to Do When Working Harder Isn't Working.\" This is the first field manual for any physician in any specialty to build a more Ideal Practice and balanced life.\n\nUsing over 1,257 hours of one-on-one coaching experience working with hundreds of burned out doctors, Dr. Drummond wrote \"Stop Physician Burnout\" to show physicians how to recognize burnout when it strikes and 21 tools proven to actually prevent it.\n\nThe first half of \"Stop Physician Burnout\" teaches burnout's causes, complications, pathophysiology and the different ways it presents in men and women. The second half of the book teaches 21 different techniques to decrease the unique stresses experienced by today's practicing physician. Each technique can be implemented immediately and has been field-tested to produce immediate benefits to the user. Dr. Drummond also includes chapters on a breakthrough method to find your ideal job and how to create an ideal retirement. He illustrates the potency of his real-world advice with seven case studies taken from his own pool of physician coaching clients.\n\nWith physician burnout at epidemic levels and a tidal wave of newly insured patients on the way, healthcare organizations are stretched to the breaking point. Despite the need for tools to support the health of the providers, there remains an enormous gap in the education of modern physicians\u2026 until now.\n\n\"Stop Physician Burnout\" is the first field-tested guide to lowering stress levels and creating a more Ideal Practice for the modern physician. It deserves a place on the desk of every practicing physician and in the curriculum of every medical school and residency program in the nation.\n\nPurchase your copy from TheHappyMD.com website at http://www.thehappymd.com/book.\n\nInternational orders can be completed through Amazon.com by searching \"Stop Physician Burnout\" or with the direct link here: http://www.amazon.com/Stop-Physician-Burnout-Working-Harder/dp/1937660346/\n\n\n\nFor Bulk Orders at a significant discount or speaking or interview requests, contact Dr. Drummond directly using this link: http://www.thehappymd.com/contact\n\nResearch shows an average of one in three physicians suffer from burnout on any given office day and, in a 2012 study, 60% of doctors said they would quit if they \"had the means.\" Healthcare organizations are struggling to keep doctors healthy and patients happy. Adding to these pressures, the implementation of the Affordable Care Act is projected to produce a physician shortage of 91,500 by 2020.\n\n\"Physicians are often the canary in the coal mine of medicine and that has to change. The most successful healthcare organizations in the years ahead will be those who take excellent care of their providers and staff. 'Stop Physician Burnout' is an authentic breakthrough as the first burnout prevention self-help manual for the modern physician,\" Drummond says.\n\nEach of the tools in \"Stop Physician Burnout\" has been field tested with hundreds of practicing physicians.
