These women attended a weekly support group, weekly weigh-ins, and maintained a food and exercise diary. The other half of women underwent their usual care, meeting once with a registered dietician to discuss healthy eating and exercise for pregnancy.\n\nAnd after 34 weeks of pregnancy, the women in the intervention program only gained an average of 11 pounds compared to the 18 pounds women not in the program gained. Post-pregnancy, the intervention helped women lose rather than gain weight \u2014 a 6-pound loss versus 3-pound gain.\n\nAn even bigger benefit to maintaining healthy habits during pregnancy was the decreased chance of giving birth to babies large for their gestational age. Women in the intervention program were only nine percent likely to do so, whereas women receiving their usual care were 26 percent more likely to give birth to large-for-gestational age babies. The latter both complicates delivery and increases the child\u2019s risk for obesity later in life.\n\n\"Most women in our intervention did gain some weight, but they gained and retained significantly less than women who did not participate in the intervention,\" Dr. Vesco said. \"Even with support, it's difficult to limit weight gain during pregnancy, so women who are overweight or obese should aim for the lower end of the weight-gain range recommended by the Institute of Medicine, and they should seek support and nutritional advice to help meet their goals.\"\n\nThis range falls between 11 and 20 pounds. In addition to better health for both new moms and babies, limiting weight gain reduces risk for additional complications, including preeclampsia (high blood pressure and kidney damage), gestational diabtetes, and otherwise birthing injuries.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "support, group, healthy, moms, helps, obese, pregnant, women, limit, weight, gain, improve", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Maintaining healthy habits during pregnancy helps both moms-to-be and babies.", "title": "Food Journals And Weekly Meetings Keep Obese Moms-To-Be Healthy", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/support-group-healthy-moms-helps-obese-pregnant-women-limit-weight-gain-improve-delivery-300388", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/28/pregnant-woman.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Maintaining healthy habits during pregnancy helps both moms-to-be and babies.", "title": "Food Journals And Weekly Meetings Keep Obese Moms-To-Be Healthy", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/support-group-healthy-moms-helps-obese-pregnant-women-limit-weight-gain-improve-delivery-300388", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/28/pregnant-woman.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/28/pregnant-woman.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Healthy Living", "published_time": "2014-08-28T16:09:41-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-08-28T16:09:41-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Maintaining healthy habits during pregnancy helps both moms-to-be and babies."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe4a27\"", "article_summary": "Post-pregnancy, the intervention helped women lose rather than gain weight \u2014 a 6-pound loss versus 3-pound gain.\nThe intervention was a program called Healthy Moms, and it involved half of the 114 obese women \u2014 a body mass index of 30 or more \u2014 participating in the study.\nIn addition to better health for both new moms and babies, limiting weight gain reduces risk for additional complications, including preeclampsia (high blood pressure and kidney damage), gestational diabtetes, and otherwise birthing injuries.\n\"Most women in our intervention did gain some weight, but they gained and retained significantly less than women who did not participate in the intervention,\" Dr. Vesco said.\nAnd after 34 weeks of pregnancy, the women in the intervention program only gained an average of 11 pounds compared to the 18 pounds women not in the program gained."}
