Meanwhile, below, AL.com has created a way you can search for your doctor.\n\nThe top recipient of drug or device company money in Alabama during the five-month time frame is Birmingham orthodontist Dr. David Sarver who made $75,139. Double that and it's about what he makes a year outside his practice, he said.\n\n\"I'm basically a rent-a-brain; I've authored four textbooks,\" Sarver said. \"So they like to know what I think and are willing to pay for me to give advice on how to design hardware and software for orthodontists and dentists.\"\n\nDrug companies have for years given money to doctors for honoraria, consulting, travel expenses, speeches, seminars and research. The companies and some doctors say the money helps further doctors' education and contributes to research breakthroughs. Critics say the money can be a thinly veiled payoff to influence prescribing habits, promote a brand drug or even control a scientific outcome in research.\n\nIn this latest data federal release, drug and device companies made 4.4 million payments totaling $3.5 billion in a five-month period at the end of 2013.\n\nThe money involved 546,000 health care professionals and 1,360 teaching hospitals.\n\nThe program, a part of the Affordable Care Act, is called Open Payments and seeks to provide more transparency in the nation's health care system - with twin goals to reduce costs and boost quality care.\n\nIn Alabama, 28 doctors received at least $10,000 in payments, according to the data.\n\nDr. Eric Baum, a Gadsden dermatologist is the fourth highest recipient in Alabama, receiving $47,667 during the last five months of 2013. He said he is paid by pharmaceutical companies to speak and advise and doesn't see anything wrong with it.\n\n\"If I felt it influenced me I'd be embarrassed,' Baum said. \"I'm very open, a patient can tell me anything they want and I'll answer. ... I personally don't speak for products I don't like. If I like it and use it, I'm glad to do a talk about it. But I only talk about drugs that work well.\"\n\nThe largest portion of Baum's money came from the pharmaceutical company Ranbaxy Inc.\n\nSarver got the bulk of his money listed in the federal database from the dental equipment company Carestream Dental.\n\nSarver said an example of what he has done: advising Kodak on building a special CT scan that uses less radiation.\n\n\"I advised Kodak there's no sense for me to shoot a full head CT on 8-year-olds,\" Sarver said.\n\n\"I feel like I'm doing good things for the money I make.\"\n\nThe top 5 recipients of drug, device company money during the last five months of 2013:\n\nDavid Sarver, orthodontist, Birmingham, $75,139 Jack A. Dipalma, gastroenterologist, Mobile, $54,585 Timothy A. Holt, operates spinal clinic, Montgomery, $49,656. Eric W. Baum, dermatologist, Gadsden, $47,667.
