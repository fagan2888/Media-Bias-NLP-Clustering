INDIANAPOLIS – Hundreds of thousands of Hoosiers could find themselves without insurance if a fix to problems with Obamacare isn’t completed soon.

Cecily Ramey is one of many who got a letter that she’s losing her insurance. Now it’s become a headache she just can’t shake.

“It’s very frustrating,” Ramey said.

Ramey’s not alone. More than 100,000 Hoosiers have seen their insurance plans cancelled, most because they buy individual plans that no longer qualify under Obamacare.

Others, like Ramey, are losing Medicaid plans like Healthy Indiana because of changes in income thresholds.

“What am I going to do for my medications? What are other people going to do?” Ramey said.

Despite the President’s plan this week to allow insurers to extend those plans, Logan Harrison with the Indiana Department of Insurance refutes that.

“We knew that there were going to be cancellations of policies,” Harrison said.

In fact, Harrison and other state leaders say they already spent years working with insurers to rewrite their plans.

“For the perception to be created that … it’s just so easy that we could reorder a plan that is no longer in existence is absurd,” Harrison said.

The problem is even worse because Ramey and others are unable to access new plans on Healthcare.gov. Until it’s fixed, many are left waiting and hoping they’ll find insurance by the first of the year.

“What’s it going to cover? How much is the premium? What’s my out of pocket? I need to know those kind of questions to balance my budget and prepare for this,” Ramey said.
