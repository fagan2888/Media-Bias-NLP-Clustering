Valley Community Health hires new CEO

Valley Community Health Centers has hired Mara Jiran as its new CEO.

Jiran previously worked for the Grand Forks Alliance for Healthcare Access and in other leadership roles at Valley Community Health. She replaces Doug Jaeger, who had been CEO since February.

Jiran would not comment on Jaeger's departure, only saying it was "a change in leadership."

As Jiran takes over the CEO role, she sees opportunities to strengthen Valley Community Health's relationships with other health care and nonprofit organizations throughout the region, as well as starting new projects to continue providing easier access to health care.

Valley Community Health, a nonprofit, operates health care clinics in downtown Grand Forks, Larimore and Northwood and has a dental clinic at its Grand Forks location. All of the clinics accept patients of all insurance plans regardless of income level.

New projects

With all of its clinics seeing steady numbers, Valley Community Health is working on expanding its Grand Forks clinic to include behavioral health.

"If you can find a way to address that, you see better medical outcomes and better physical outcomes," she said. The idea would be to integrate behavioral health examination into a regular physical, she said.

Valley Community Health recently received a grant from the Health Resources and Services Administration so it can partner with UND on behavioral health care, Jiran said. She expects the training and planning for that to start in January.

Valley Community Health is also working on providing better health care access for new Americans and continuing to help clients understand changes to insurance through the Affordable Care Act, Jiran said.

"We're pretty excited for these opportunities," she said.
