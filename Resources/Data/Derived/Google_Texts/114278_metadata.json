That grace period is coming to a swift end -- the late filing period closes on Oct. 15 \u2013 which could bring some unwelcome news to procrastinating taxpayers.\n\nIt\u2019s not an issue affecting only a few stragglers: The IRS said that as of late September, one-quarter of the Americans who asked for an extension still haven\u2019t sent in their returns. That means about 3.25 million households may be still sitting on their 2014 tax forms.\n\nRelated: The 10 Worst States for Property Taxes\n\nMissing Thursday\u2019s deadline could deliver a financial punch in the form of a failure-to-file penalty, whose bite is far worse than those of failing to pay owed taxes. So for Americans who are juggling whether it\u2019s better to blow the deadline or file and face the consequences of failing to pay the IRS, it\u2019s important to realize that the second option is far better.\n\nHere\u2019s how the penalties play out: Failing to file by Oct. 15 will result in a 5 percent penalty per month of your unpaid tax liability.\n\nOn the other hand, if you file your returns by Oct. 15 but can\u2019t pay what you owe, the fine is typically one-half of one percent of your unpaid liabilities \u2013 so a fraction of what you\u2019ll owe if you skip the deadline.\n\nThe IRS, of course, wants Americans to pay up and will work with filers to create installment plans if they can\u2019t pay their debt right away. Turbo Tax notes that the IRS will allow consumers to pay their tax obligations over a six-year period.\n\nThere are some exceptions to the Oct. 15 deadline, including for members of the military and others who are serving in combat zones. For everyone else, the IRS is recommending using the online e-file or Free File system to get in their returns before Thursday.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Before April 15, about 13 million Americans checked off the box for a six-month extens", "title": "Tax Extension Deadline Is Coming: Here\u2019s How to Avoid Getting Dinged", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/10/09/Tax-Extension-Deadline-Coming-Here-s-How-Avoid-Getting-Dinged", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/04072010_Paperwork_pile_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/10/09/Tax-Extension-Deadline-Coming-Here-s-How-Avoid-Getting-Dinged", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/04072010_Paperwork_pile_article.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Before April 15, about 13 million Americans checked off the box for a six-month extens", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2fb8\"", "article_summary": "There are some exceptions to the Oct. 15 deadline, including for members of the military and others who are serving in combat zones.\nThat grace period is coming to a swift end -- the late filing period closes on Oct. 15 \u2013 which could bring some unwelcome news to procrastinating taxpayers.\nTurbo Tax notes that the IRS will allow consumers to pay their tax obligations over a six-year period.\nHere\u2019s how the penalties play out: Failing to file by Oct. 15 will result in a 5 percent penalty per month of your unpaid tax liability.\nBefore April 15, about 13 million Americans checked off the box for a six-month extension on filing their taxes."}
