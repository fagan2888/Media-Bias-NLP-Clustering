Walker and Matt Brown said Tuesday they are moving the 21-plus event to downtown club Norad Dance Bar, where pot won\u2019t be available for sale but it will be openly consumed as advertised \u2014 a somewhat untested and contested experiment.\n\n\u201cThis is a private event, and smoking marijuana within private is completely legal, so we\u2019ll actually be able to consume on site within the boundaries of state and city laws,\u201d said Walker. \u201cWe\u2019ll have vaporizing inside, and I believe dabbing is also legal, but I don\u2019t think joint smoking will be inside \u2014 but that\u2019ll be out on the patio.\u201d\n\nGrowing and holding marijuana in Colorado has been legal for a year, but shops can start selling pot for recreational purposes on Jan. 1.\n\nOrganizers will have an open-to-the-public party on Norad\u2019s ground floor with alcohol sales but no smoking/consuming pot for a $10 cover; Upstairs at Norad will have no alcohol but open pot consumption, a private party via an online invitation-request system.\n\nHow the private party works: Interested people can request invites at cannabition.com, and then they\u2019ll purchase $5 tickets online via a promotional code emailed to them by one of the party\u2019s sponsors. Day-of invitation requests will be available. Tickets for Cannabition\u2019s private portion will not be sold at the door, but Walker said consumers will be able to request the invite and purchase tickets on their smartphones.\n\n\u201cHaving that extra step of going through one of our sponsors to get the invite is our process of keeping this event private,\u201d said Walker.\n\nThe Cannabition team and Christou\u2019s lawyers had been in contact with the office of City Council member Charlie Brown and others, they said, but those conversations weren\u2019t enough to make Christou and his team feel safe about hosting the event.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to see how this could affect our liquor license,\u201d said Doug Bohm, marketing and promotions director at Christou\u2019s SoCo Nightlife. \u201cBut the powers that be are being intentionally vague about the legality of the event.\u201d\n\nCouncilman Brown didn\u2019t return messages left Tuesday.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been going back and forth with various people in city government for about three weeks now,\u201d said Matt Brown, who runs Cannabition as well as marijuana tourism company My 420 Tours. \u201cWe could have planned the event, not told anybody and gone with it, and it would have been fine. But then we realized the city has very few definitions, and nobody knows what you can or can\u2019t do under the current law.\u201d\n\nBut Cannabition moves on regardless. And Walker hopes his event has a different aesthetic than the parties that came before.\n\n\u201cEverything in the past has been about protesting,\u201d Walker said, \u201cand I want this to be a celebration of how far we\u2019ve come in Colorado and showing that this is the first day of recreational pot being sold, which has been 70-plus years in the making.\u201d\n\nRicardo Baca: 303-954-1394, rbaca@denverpost.com or twitter.com/bruvs", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Denver\u2019s Pot-friendly Cannabition party forced to find a new home", "title": "Denver\u2019s Pot-friendly Cannabition party forced to find a new home", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2013/12/24/denvers-pot-friendly-cannabition-party-forced-to-find-a-new-home/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20131224__marijuanap1-1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20131224__marijuanap1-1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2013-12-24T17:36:31+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-28T13:57:12+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc67e\"", "article_summary": "The big Cannabition event originally scheduled at Broadway venue City Hall on Jan. 1 will no longer happen at the Regas Christou-owned space, the club owner said Monday.\n\u201cHaving that extra step of going through one of our sponsors to get the invite is our process of keeping this event private,\u201d said Walker.\nColorado\u2019s largest New Year\u2019s Day party celebrating the modern world\u2019s first legal recreational pot sales hit a snag this week, but recovered quickly.\nHow the private party works: Interested people can request invites at cannabition.com, and then they\u2019ll purchase $5 tickets online via a promotional code emailed to them by one of the party\u2019s sponsors.\nOrganizers will have an open-to-the-public party on Norad\u2019s ground floor with alcohol sales but no smoking/consuming pot for a $10 cover; Upstairs at Norad will have no alcohol but open pot consumption, a private party via an online invitation-request system."}
