The refrigerator went online on July 12, 1998, and it\u2019s still there. All it does is record and broadcast every time the fridge door opens. As of this writing, its owner, Alex van Es, has opened it almost 70,000 times in the last 16 years. Call it the Quantified Fridge.\n\nOutside of the pure voyeuristic novelty, there\u2019s not a lot of value from this information. It\u2019s certainly not life altering, and it\u2019s certainly not going to lead to everyone\u2019s favorite new design pastime: behavior change. Not all data is created equal, and certainly not all of it is meaningful to collect and display. I\u2019m pretty sure the number of times a refrigerator has been opened falls into this category.\n\nDan Saffer About Dan Saffer is a Creative Director at Smart Design, Dan leads teams in creating new interaction paradigms across a wide range of products, spanning both digital and physical.

What is this object doing, and is that good or bad? How much energy/resources/time is it consuming? Is something broken? Connecting sensors to the right internal components and sending that data online where it can be viewed via an app or web page is a way of giving you x-ray vision. But the emphasis here is on \u201cright.\u201d I probably don\u2019t care how many times the fridge door has been opened, but I do care if the compressor breaks and everything in my freezer starts melting.\n\nAnd that\u2019s the second reason to put anything on the Internet: to be able to adjust it if something is wrong. If I get an alert that the temperature inside my refrigerator is suddenly rising, it would be great to be able to do something about it: attempt to fix the problem right there, order a new part, or replace the device with a new one. You could summon a repairman to come fix it.\n\nThis kind of connecting of objects to services is the third reason to connect something to the Internet: to easily engage resources outside of the object to improve, fix, or extend the object. If my dishwasher runs out of detergent, reorder it or add it to my shopping list.\n\nThe Wrong Way to Connect Appliances\n\nConnecting your refrigerator to your shopping list has been a dream of manufacturers since the first commercial Internet fridge launched in 2000 by LG. But do you\u2014does anyone\u2014want to scan bar codes as they put food into their so-called \u201csmart\u201d refrigerator?\n\nWhat connectivity shouldn\u2019t do is turn you into a slave to your devices, constantly monitoring them or, worse, feeding them data. Don\u2019t make me answer questions or alerts unless they are dire. But these are not successful arguments against connectivity, since they are design problems that can be solved.\n\nProblems that Internet-connected appliances must resolve:\n\n\u2022 You don\u2019t want to remove physical controls: In the early dawn light, as you groggily stand in front of your coffee machine, do you want to find your phone and launch an app so you can get your morning caffeine fix? No you do not.\n\n\u2022 You don\u2019t need to run general-purpose apps: \u201cHey, I\u2019ve got a few minutes. How about I use the screen on my stove to surf Facebook?\u201d said no one, ever.\n\n\u2022 You don\u2019t need irrelevant data: Knowing how many gallons of dishwashing detergent I\u2019ve used over the years? Fascinating stuff.\n\n\u2022 You don\u2019t want unrelated data collected and sold: I don\u2019t want my appliances spying on me, or even suspect that they do. Observe me and my patterns, yes. Spy on me, no. And there\u2019s a big difference. Spying involves giving away private information (secrets) to people I don\u2019t want to know them. If you are using information from my dishwasher to upsell me life insurance, that\u2019s intrusive. It feels creepy in a way that knowing I\u2019m out of detergent and offering to buy more does not.\n\nEven if all of this get solved, why bother put your refrigerator on the Internet? Especially if hackers could turn it into a spam machine? So it can be smart.\n\nThe Right Kind of Smarts\n\nSmart appliances humbly predict our needs and modestly adjust as little as possible to accommodate them. This sometimes requires connecting to the network for a better, bigger brain or to draw upon the collected intelligence of similar objects. You don\u2019t need to stuff lots of processing power and memory into the object itself if it can use resources in the cloud. Imagine if your refrigerator could learn how to keep food cooler more cheaply by looking at the data from other refrigerators in the area? Collective machine intelligence and the benefits it could engender such as fixing model-specific problems and product efficiency are good reasons to enable network connectivity.\n\nWe can also have a conversation with smart appliances. They can tell us what they\u2019re up to when we ask, or tell us something\u2019s wrong when it\u2019s essential. They can observe our lives and provide small insights we don\u2019t even notice. They can talk to other appliances, and pass along helpful information, the way that Nest Protect will tell the Nest thermostat to shut off the furnace if it detects carbon monoxide.\n\nWe can have a new relationship with our appliances, one where the previously mute boxes of plastic and metal become new platforms\u2014not for apps, but for meaning and value. By learning how we use them and how we live our lives, they\u2019ll be able to provide services to us we can\u2019t see right now. They\u2019ll set themselves up and fit into the existing household by knowing what\u2014and who\u2014is there and adapting to them. Appliances will grow and change with you and the house.\n\nConnectivity, just like installing a microprocessor was decades ago, has to be a means to an end: more effective, more efficient, more resilient, more transparent, more powerful, more interesting, more enjoyable, more adaptable products.", "article_metadata": {"Subsection": "WIRED", "description": "Imagine if your refrigerator could learn how to keep food cooler more cheaply by looking at the data from other refrigerators in the area?", "application-name": "WIRED: WIRED", "Author": "Dan Saffer", "og": {"site_name": "WIRED", "description": "Imagine if your refrigerator could learn how to keep food cooler more cheaply by looking at the data from other refrigerators in the area?", "title": "The Wonderful Possibilities of Connecting Your Fridge to the Internet", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 660, "identifier": "http://www.wired.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/plaform-wars-ft.jpg", "height": 330}, "url": "http://www.wired.com/2014/10/is-your-refrigerator-running/", "type": "article"}, "Section": "Blog", "msapplication-TileColor": "#cb0004", "msapplication-tooltip": "Read in-depth coverage of current and future trends in technology, and how they are shaping business, entertainment, communications, science, politics, and culture at Wired.com.", "twitter": {"domain": "WIRED", "description": "Imagine if your refrigerator could learn how to keep food cooler more cheaply by looking at the data from other refrigerators in the area?", "title": "The Wonderful Possibilities of Connecting Your Fridge to the Internet", "image": {"src": "http://www.wired.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/plaform-wars-ft.jpg"}, "creator": "@wired", "site": "@wired", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "gmapkey": "ABQIAAAAF5yd_X_vTzike6sB6lp3wBQ4h890iMeKvsDZGQOc75SG0lWKAhQW755bw9E_-3ijKe6eqE5sg_NLEw", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=373903654", "fb": {"page_id": 19440638720}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.wired.com/wp-content/themes/Phoenix/assets/images/favicon_ie.png", "DisplayDate": "2014-10-29", "robots": "index, follow", "article": {"section": "Opinion", "tag": "smart home"}, "ExpiryDate": "2060-12-31", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"The Wonderful Possibilities of Connecting Your Fridge to the Internet\", \"link\": \"http://www.wired.com/2014/10/is-your-refrigerator-running/\", \"image_url\": \"http://www.wired.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/plaform-wars-ft-150x150.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"1613123\", \"pub_date\": \"2014-10-29T06:30:42+00:00\", \"section\": \"WIRED\", \"author\": \"Wired Opinion\", \"tags\": [\"Interaction Design\",\"smart home\"]}", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimal-ui, shrink-to-fit=no", "news_keywords": "Interaction Design, smart home"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1223\"", "article_summary": "And that\u2019s the second reason to put anything on the Internet: to be able to adjust it if something is wrong.\nThe Wrong Way to Connect AppliancesConnecting your refrigerator to your shopping list has been a dream of manufacturers since the first commercial Internet fridge launched in 2000 by LG.\nEven if all of this get solved, why bother put your refrigerator on the Internet?\n\u2022 You don\u2019t want unrelated data collected and sold: I don\u2019t want my appliances spying on me, or even suspect that they do.\nHowever, one valid reason to put something on the Internet is to check its status."}
