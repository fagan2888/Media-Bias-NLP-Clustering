Also as expected, sales of instruments and accessories for the da Vinci robotic surgery system increased 6% and accounted for 46.5% of total revenues.\n\nGAAP earnings for the quarter came in at $4.28 per diluted share, slightly below the year-ago quarter. This metric was not pre-announced, and the average analyst projection pointed at a much lower $3.83 per share.\n\nIntuitive sold 138 da Vinci systems in the quarter, 21% below the year-ago period's 175 systems. The decline was driven by hospitals setting conservative budgets as they adjust to the new Obamacare health insurance system. Machine sales are increasing abroad, particularly in the Japanese market.\n\n\"For 2014, we are focused on expanding use of da Vinci in general surgery, particularly colorectal surgery and single-incision surgery,\" said CEO Gary Guthart. Europe and Japan are Intuitive's main target markets for international growth this year.\n\nIn after-hours trading, Intuitive Surgical's shares initially jumped as much as 3.1% higher on the earnings surprise, but reversed course to trade down 4.3% at the time of writing as the analyst call started.", "article_metadata": {"publish_time": "17:02", "description": "Robotic surgery specialist Intuitive Surgical beat Wall Street's earnings targets in the fourth quarter, despite pre-announcing soft sales.", "ResponsiveALP": "1Ses_2things-v-single_single-control_50", "author": "Anders Bylund", "promo": "Robotic surgery specialist Intuitive Surgical beat Wall Street's earnings targets in the fourth quarter, despite pre-announcing soft sales.", "twitter": {"title": "Intuitive Surgical, Inc.
