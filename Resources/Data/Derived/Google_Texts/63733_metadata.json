Then, starting in January 2017, Michigan is required to fund about 5 percent of costs, or about $150 million per year, rising to 10 percent by 2021.\n\n\n\nSo far, 603,000 Michiganders have signed up for Healthy Michigan, far exceeding the 450,000 state projections for the first two years.\n\n\n\nBut for the program to continue, the state Legislature must find at least $150 million in general funds for fiscal 2017, which begins Oct. 1, 2016.\n\nCORRECTION APPENDED\n\nWhen championing Medicaid expansion under health care reform in 2013, Gov. Rick Snyder spoke often about his desire to place half of the near $1 billion in state savings over the next decade into a \"health savings lockbox.\"\n\n\n\nThe state savings, primarily from lower general fund spending on mental health and prison health costs, would be used in fiscal 2017 when federal funding for Healthy Michigan Medicaid expansion started to decline and the state needed to contribute up to 10 percent of total costs to keep the program going.\n\n\n\nBut despite Snyder's budget recommendations to fund the lockbox in fiscal 2014 and 2015, the state Legislature failed to place 50 percent of state savings \u2014 which amounted to more than $220 million \u2014 into the health savings sub-account of the governor's budget stabilization fund.\n\n\n\nWith the state facing a budget shortfall of at least $400 million in fiscal 2016, there also is no proposal this year to set aside state savings from Healthy Michigan expansion.\n\n\n\n\"We are concerned about further funding for Healthy Michigan,\" said Rick Murdock, executive director of the Michigan Association of Health Plans, which represents 12 of the state's 13 Medicaid HMOs.\n\n\n\nMurdock said his concern is two-fold: One, how legislators will deal with the politics of Medicaid expansion; and two, how legislators will find the dollars to fund Healthy Michigan, especially since the state is expected to face revenue shortfalls the next two years.\n\n\n\nNearly 20 percent of the state's population, or about 1.8 million people, are now covered by Medicaid, a number already swelled by 600,000 new enrollees under Healthy Michigan.\n\n\n\n\"We have hundreds of thousands of people receiving health care coverage\" through Healthy Michigan, said Jan Hudson, a health policy analyst with the Michigan League for Public Policy in Lansing. \"It is worth finding a way to continue to do it.\"\n\n\n\nBecause Healthy Michigan, or Public Act 107, covers expenses for people who had received services previously paid for by the state general fund, the state is projected to save $983 million from 2014 to 2023, according to a report by the Ann Arbor-based Center for Healthcare Research & Transformation.\n\n\n\nMarianne Udow-Phillips, the center's director, said the lockbox funding provision requirement dropped out of the Healthy Michigan bill in 2013 because there weren't enough Republican votes.\n\n\n\nAs it was, Healthy Michigan was narrowly approved in the Senate by a 20-18 vote. It was signed into law by Snyder in September 2013 and went into effect April 1, 2014.\n\n\n\n\"The state can drop out of Healthy Michigan (as early as 2017) if the savings don't materialize as expected,\" Udow-Phillips said.\n\n\n\n\n\nEditor's note: An earlier version of this story incorrectly identified Sen. Jim Marleau as chairman of the Senate Health Policy Committee. Sen. Mike Shirkey recently was appointed to that post.\n\nRelated Links", "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no, minimal-ui", "description": "Gov.
