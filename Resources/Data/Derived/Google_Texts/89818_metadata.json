There are also shows scheduled for Dec. 20.\n\nThe light show is chaired each year by Daniel Brateris, founder of dj Dan Productions which builds and produces it.\n\nAttendees will experience a show with more than 1,000 individual strands of lights and 80,000 bulbs, pyrotechnic effects, color-changing lights and robotic effects synchronized to Christmas music. Santa Claus and his elves will also appear at the show.\n\nThe show will feature a musical performance by Chris Pinnella, who is a touring member and lead singer for the Trans Siberian Orchestra.\n\nChallenged Youth Sports, a recreational program for special needs children, will be accepting donations at the show. Last year, the event raised nearly $10,000 for Challenged Youth Sports, organizers say.\n\nThe shows are free and run for about 20 minutes. Parking for the show will be available at the North Wall Little League Field, 2744 Belmar Blvd.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://on.app.com/1AlxxVx", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Wall township will celebrate the holiday season this Saturday and Sunday with its annual Christmas Light Show at 2702 Woolley Road.", "og": {"site_name": "Asbury Park Press", "description": "Wall township will celebrate the holiday season this Saturday and Sunday with its annual Christmas Light Show at 2702 Woolley Road.", "title": "Holiday show to light up Wall Township", "url": "http://www.app.com/story/news/local/monmouth-county/2014/12/11/holiday-show-light-wall-township/20253291/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/app.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Wall township will celebrate the holiday season this Saturday and Sunday with its annual Christmas Light Show at 2702 Woolley Road.", "title": "Wall lights show set for this weekend", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/35db4c4af05281296c4e552ce294340d6d26ab8f/c=228-0-797-569&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/AsburyPark/2014/12/11/B9315460689Z.1_20141211222458_000_G979CN0AL.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@AsburyParkPress", "site": "@AsburyParkPress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600068887", "fb": {"app_id": 116172675120111}, "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/nicquel.terry"}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": "Wall, Wall township, Monmouth County, Christmas, light show"}, "article_summary": "Parking for the show will be available at the North Wall Little League Field, 2744 Belmar Blvd.\nParking is at the North Wall Little League Field, 2744 Belmar Blvd.\nWall will celebrate the holiday season Saturday and Sunday with its annual Christmas Light Show at 2702 Woolley Road.\n(Photo: PROVIDED PHOTO)The township will celebrate the holiday season this Saturday and Sunday with its annual Christmas Light Show at 2702 Woolley Road.\nAttendees will experience a show with more than 1,000 individual strands of lights and 80,000 bulbs, pyrotechnic effects, color-changing lights and robotic effects synchronized to Christmas music."}
