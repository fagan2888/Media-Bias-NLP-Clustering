Ted Cruz excites the passions of both his admirers and his detractors. The latter greatly outnumber the former for the moment and probably indefinitely, and they don\u2019t merely dislike Cruz. They despise him.\n\nAnimosity that intense and widespread usually has more than one explanation, but I doubt fear is one of them. Certainly the Texas Republican\u2019s constant self-aggrandizing contributes to it. That\u2019s a common enough vice among politicians, but Cruz\u2019s self-promotion is so fulsome and relentless it appears to be pathological rather than a bad habit.\n\nTake, for example, his recent appearance at the Values Voter Summit, where Cruz was heckled by a contingent of immigration reform supporters, whom he superciliously disdained as \u201cpaid political operatives\u201d of President Obama. He dismissed the interruption with the assertion \u201cthe left will always, always, always let you know who they fear, and they fear you.\u201d By \u201cyou,\u201d I think he likely meant \u201cme.\u201d And, of course, not all immigration reformers are of the left. But that\u2019s another matter.\n\nAt another point in his remarks, Cruz attempted a little humor, and that too was conveyed with his trademark self-importance. Referencing a meeting between Obama and Senate Republicans scheduled for later that day, Cruz asked his audience, \u201cIf I\u2019m never seen again, please send a search and rescue team. I very much hope tomorrow morning I don\u2019t wake up amidst the Syrian rebels.\u201d Funny, unless you\u2019re a Syrian rebel.\n\nThe real joke is the senator\u2019s presumption that Democrats would like him to disappear. Why would they want that? They\u2019re not afraid of him. They\u2019re counting on him. If the president thought for a moment that Cruz was actually in some danger, I imagine he would immediately provide him a Secret Service detail.\n\nLet\u2019s examine briefly the good service our scourge of the squishes has recently rendered the president and the Democratic Party. Cruz appointed himself the leader of the effort to shut down the government and risk defaulting on the nation\u2019s debts to force the president to surrender on Obamacare -- and he tried to shame other Republicans into joining him by accusing them of not being strong like Ted.\n\nThat effort proved suicidal, as predicted by nearly everyone not floating high above the grubby intrigues of mere mortal politicians in an impenetrable bubble of self-regard. And it did produce political benefits. Unfortunately, they all accrued to the other side.\n\nThe widely respected NBC-Wall Street Journal poll offers a tour d\u2019 horizon of the damage. One of the polls authors\u2019, Bill McInturff, called it \u201camong the handful of surveys that stand out in my career as being significant and consequential.\u201d\n\nJust 14 percent of Americans now believe the country is on the \u201cright track,\u201d and confidence in the economy has dropped 16 percent in one month. Not all of that dissatisfaction was caused by the government shutdown, but it\u2019s certainly a major contributor; 63 percent of those interviewed said this recent example of Washington\u2019s dysfunction has made them less confident.\n\nAnd whom do they blame for their dissatisfaction? They blame everyone in Washington. But Republicans receive by far the greatest share of the disgust. Voters hold Republicans more accountable for the shutdown by a margin of 22 percentage points over Obama. Republican and Tea Party favorability ratings have fallen to historic lows -- 24 percent and 21 percent, respectively. Obama\u2019s own favorability ratings are nothing to brag about -- but he is more popular than any other politician in Washington.\n\nJust over half of those polled say they want the government to do more rather than less. Cruz and his confederates are managing to make the country more sympathetic to the central tenet of Democrats\u2019 governing philosophy.\n\nBut the most perverse consequence has to be that support for Obamacare has increased. It\u2019s still unpopular, but less so than it was before the shutdown. A majority of Americans now say they do not want funding for it totally eliminated. And all this happened during the program\u2019s launch, which was, by bipartisan consensus, a disaster, with millions of people unable to choose a health care plan because of faulty software that could have been better designed by the average teenager. Had Cruz and his allies not gotten in the way, Obamacare might have become as unpopular as they now are.\n\nGood work, fellas. As McInturff noted, their gambit turned into an \u201cideological boomerang.\u201d Is there any chance they\u2019ll sit down now and let adults try to repair the damage? Probably not, which is more good news for Democrats.\n\nLiberals may despise Cruz, but in one of those ironies common in politics, they know that right now he\u2019s big government\u2019s best friend. Democrats won\u2019t utter the words out loud, but in their hearts they\u2019re chanting, \u201cGo, Ted, Go!\u201d And in quiet moments, as they count their unearned blessings, they dare to dream their secret ally might be the next Republican nominee for president.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Sen.
