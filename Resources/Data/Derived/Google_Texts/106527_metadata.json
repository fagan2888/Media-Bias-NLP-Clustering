We received this year an exceptional number of standout entries, which made choosing the winners that much harder. As in years past, we relied on a combination of staff picks and input from outside experts and analysts to narrow down the list to the 10 you'll read about below.\n\nThis year's Top HR Products run the gamut of HR, from benefits to payroll to recruiting to career development. One award winner is designed specifically around the Affordable Care Act and its many (and still evolving) rules and regulations, while another lets HR do a \"deep dive\" into employee engagement. Another uses gamification to spur employees into making more and better referrals. In keeping with recent trends, social and mobile are well-represented, but this year's crop makes exceptionally good use of these mediums in order to make HR's job easier. (To be considered, products had to be released between July 2012 and June 2013.)\n\nIn our estimation, the products you'll find in the next few pages are the best of the solutions we received, and can -- we think -- not only deliver on their promises but also make HR's job a little easier. As always, though, we encourage you to perform your own due diligence before making any investments.\n\nCornerstone Recruiting Cloud\n\nCornerstone OnDemand, Santa Monica, Calif.\n\nDayforce HCM: Payroll and Benefits\n\nCeridian, Minneapolis\n\nACA Management Platform\n\nEquifax Workforce Solutions, St. Louis\n\nSwarm\n\nFindly, San Francisco\n\niMomentous Mobile Talent Engagement Platform\n\niMomentous, Horsham, Pa.\n\nNewsletter Sign-Up: Benefits\n\nHR Technology\n\nTalent Management\n\nHR Leadership\n\nInside HR Tech\n\nHRENow\n\nSpecial Offers\n\nEmail Address\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nSumTotal elixHR\n\nSumTotal Systems, Gainesville, Fla.\n\nJobvite Engage\n\nJobvite, Burlingame, Calif.\n\nReflect by GMAC powered by Hogan\n\nGraduate Management Admission Council, Reston, Va., and Hogan Assessment Systems, Tulsa, Okla.\n\nOnboardia\n\nOnboardia Inc., Massapequa Park, N.Y.\n\nSense\n\nBlackbookHR, Cincinnati", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.hreonline.com/HRE/view/story.jhtml?id=534356151", "type": "article", "site_name": "www.HREOnline.com", "title": "And the Winners Are..."}, "description": "The editors of  HRE  announce their choices for the top 10 HR products of 2013.", "viewport": "user-scalable=yes, width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2248\"", "article_summary": "The editors of Human Resource Executive\u00ae announce their choices for the top 10 HR products of 2013.\nHere's our list of the Top HR Products winners for 2013.\nThis year's Top HR Products run the gamut of HR, from benefits to payroll to recruiting to career development.\nWe received this year an exceptional number of standout entries, which made choosing the winners that much harder.\nReflect by GMAC powered by HoganGraduate Management Admission Council, Reston, Va., and Hogan Assessment Systems, Tulsa, Okla.OnboardiaOnboardia Inc., Massapequa Park, N.Y."}
