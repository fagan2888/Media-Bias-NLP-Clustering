Adelson has announced that he will be throwing his full support behind presumptive GOP presidential nominee Donald J Trump in the 2016 race for the nation\u2019s highest elective office by offering a contribution that could exceed $100 million.\n\nAccording to a New York Times report, both Adelson and Trump met last week while the former was in New York to attend the Jewish Values Network dinner. The Times reported that during their private meeting at Trump Tower, Adelson said he was willing to \u201ccontribute more to help elect him (Trump) than he has to any previous campaign,\u201d according to two Republicans with direct knowledge of Adelson\u2019s commitment.\n\nAdelson, an internationally renowned casino magnate based in Las Vegas has said that he plans to significantly reduce his giving to congressional Republicans and would direct most of his contributions to groups dedicated to Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign, according to the Times report.\n\nThus far Trump had been self funding his GOP primary campaign along with small-dollar contributions but has lacked the sort of major donor network needed to sustain him in the general election, as was reported by the Times. Trump has estimated that he may need $1 billion for the campaign but has only recently begun scheduling fund-raisers and hiring finance staff members, the report said. Many of the Republican Party\u2019s wealthiest contributors, including the billionaire brothers Charles G. and David H. Koch, have indicated they are unlikely to give to his candidacy.\n\nIn Friday\u2019s Washington Post, Adelson penned an op-ed in which he expressed his full throated support for Trump\u2019s candidacy.\n\nIf Trump isn\u2019t elected president, warned Adelson, Americans would get a third term of Barack Obama in the form of Hillary Clinton, as was reported by INN.\n\n\u201cWhile the primary cycle still has some important elections ahead, it is clear that Donald Trump will be the Republican nominee for president,\u201d he wrote, adding, \u201cI am endorsing Trump\u2019s bid for president and strongly encourage my fellow Republicans \u2014 especially our Republican elected officials, party loyalists and operatives, and those who provide important financial backing \u2014 to do the same.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe alternative to Trump being sworn in as the nation\u2019s 45th president is frightening,\u201d warned Adelson.\n\n\u201cFor nearly eight years, Republicans have fought tooth and nail against President Obama and his policies. We waged battles over debt, government spending, Obamacare and the Iran nuclear deal \u2014 an issue of paramount importance to me personally and to many others around the world.\n\n\u201cWe gained some victories, but on too many issues Obama achieved his goals, if not necessarily America\u2019s goals. As Republicans, we know that getting a person in the White House with an \u2018R\u2019 behind his name is the only way things will get better,\u201d wrote Adelson.\n\n\u201cIf Republicans do not come together in support of Trump, Obama will essentially be granted something the Constitution does not allow \u2014 a third term in the name of Hillary Clinton,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve spent time talking to Donald Trump. Do I agree with him on every issue? No. But it\u2019s unlikely that any American agrees with his or her preferred candidate on every issue,\u201d wrote Adelson.\n\nThe op-ed comes a week after the Jewish American billionaire said during a gala in Manhattan he will be supporting Trump now that he's the presumptive Republican nominee for president.\n\n\"Yes, I'm a Republican, he's a Republican. He's our nominee. Whoever the nominee would turn out to be, any one of the 17 - he was one of the 17. He won fair and square,\" said Adelson.\n\nHe added that Trump \"will be good for Israel.\"\n\nAdelson's support for Trump comes after the billionaire did not officially endorse any candidate during the Republican presidential primaries, even though he expressed willingness to back Trump in March.\n\nThat willingness came despite an initial altercation between the two in October, when Trump took aim at Adelson and wrote on Twitter that the billionaire wanted to make Senator Mark Rubio (R-FL) \"his perfect little puppet\" in the Republican race.\n\nHowever, the two met in December and apparently sorted out their differences. Adelson later said they discussed Israel, and said he found Trump to be \"very charming.\"\n\nWalter Metuth (INN)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.jewishvoiceny.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=14523&catid=110&Itemid=293", "type": "article", "image": "images/news/2016/21_may18/83.jpg", "site_name": "Jewish Voice", "title": "Sheldon Adelson Donates $100M to Trump Campaign; Expresses Support in Op-Ed"}, "title": "Sheldon Adelson Donates $100M to Trump Campaign; Expresses Support in Op-Ed", "robots": "index, follow", "generator": "Joomla! 1.5 - Open Source Content Management", "author": "catty"}, "article_summary": "But it\u2019s unlikely that any American agrees with his or her preferred candidate on every issue,\u201d wrote Adelson.\nIn Friday\u2019s Washington Post, Adelson penned an op-ed in which he expressed his full throated support for Trump\u2019s candidacy.\n\u201cFor nearly eight years, Republicans have fought tooth and nail against President Obama and his policies.\nThe op-ed comes a week after the Jewish American billionaire said during a gala in Manhattan he will be supporting Trump now that he's the presumptive Republican nominee for president.\nAs Republicans, we know that getting a person in the White House with an \u2018R\u2019 behind his name is the only way things will get better,\u201d wrote Adelson."}
