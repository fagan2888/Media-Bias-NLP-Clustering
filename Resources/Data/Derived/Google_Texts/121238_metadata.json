Ted Cruz to relent. Even in the rubble of this budget episode, the leading instigator of the showdown won\u2019t rule out dusting off the same tactics when the budget fight flares again in four months. Why should he?\n\nAs a man in a hurry to change Washington, the Texas freshman may have no better alternative to the noisy, process-gumming approach he pursued in his battle to derail Obamacare. As a 2016 White House contender, he\u2019s basking in tea party adoration. As a maverick on a mission, he can shrug off pressure within the Senate because \u2014 for better or worse \u2014 no one has any real leverage over him.\n\nFundraising? He\u2019s fine on his own. Re-election? That\u2019s five years away, and activists who love his spunk dominate Texas GOP primaries.\n\nHe\u2019s the most reviled man in Washington. But detractors in both parties are powerless to make him go away, be quiet, or play ball.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t expect him to moderate. We don\u2019t think he should moderate at all,\u201d said Chris Chocola, president of the conservative Club for Growth, Cruz\u2019s biggest backer in last year\u2019s election. \u201cOne thing about Congress, there\u2019s no CEO. Everybody\u2019s an independent contractor. Everybody answers only to their constituents who elected them to office. And Cruz has struck a chord with a lot of people.\u201d\n\nAs one strategist close to Senate GOP leaders, who spoke only on condition of anonymity because of the political sensitivity involved, put it: \u201cHe can be a conservative bomb thrower for as long as he wants. \u2026 If that\u2019s his only goal, he\u2019s going to be unstoppable. \u2026 There\u2019s no cost to him now. I think he thinks there\u2019s no cost to him at all.\u201d\n\nHere are the factors that make Cruz likely to continue \u2014 and perhaps even escalate \u2014 his confrontational ways:\n\nCruz was never going to be a wallflower. A central part of his appeal to Texas voters last year was that he would push his tea party agenda from the start, rather than quietly learning the ropes for a few years, as Senate tradition once dictated.\n\nIn Texas, Cruz is the rising star among Republicans. He sets the benchmark for Republicans facing voters next year. He is not up for re-election himself until 2018, and it\u2019s unclear if Democrats will be more of a factor by then.\n\n\u201cA more competitive political system in Texas might moderate the behavior,\u201d said James Henson, director of the Texas Politics Project at the University of Texas at Austin. \u201cThe truth is that Ted Cruz can go to Washington and assume that for his foreseeable political future in Texas, his fate is determined in the Republican primary.\u201d\n\nThat climate also makes it hard for other leading Republicans \u2014 including Texas\u2019 senior senator, John Cornyn, who faces re-election next year \u2014 to intervene with Cruz.\n\nWhen the less ideological Kay Bailey Hutchison held the state\u2019s other Senate seat, Cornyn never had a problem standing out as the more conservative. That hasn\u2019t been true since the election of Cruz, who rejected his advice to avoid the budget showdown. Cruz also has refused to endorse him for re-election \u2014 a gesture that would come at little political price.\n\nCornyn has so far escaped any serious challenge. But he will be looking over his shoulder until Dec. 9, the deadline for candidates to file to run in the GOP primary in March.\n\nIn fact, the two top Republicans in the Senate \u2014 Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky and Cornyn, his deputy \u2014 face re-election in an environment favorable to tea partiers. McConnell\u2019s main challenger collected an endorsement Friday from the Senate Conservatives Fund \u2014 a group Cruz raises money for and serves as pitchman.\n\nSo Senate GOP leaders are loathe to take Cruz to the woodshed, even assuming that they\u2019d like to, or that it would make a difference.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s just no sense picking a fight and risk alienating a group of people who you need to support you,\u201d said Scott Howell, a Dallas-based GOP strategist whose client list has included Cruz patron Jim DeMint and senators across the party\u2019s spectrum.\n\nSpend any time discussing Cruz with Republican strategists and senators and their exasperation quickly froths.\n\nThey complain he spent months selling a strategy that was doomed to fail. He promised that Obamacare could be defunded without all the mess of a government shutdown \u2014 without ever saying exactly how that would happen.\n\n\u201cIt was what I said in July, which was a plan that wouldn\u2019t work,\u201d complained Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Mo.\n\nAides to Cruz did not respond to requests for an interview with the senator for this report.\n\nIn a very real sense, there\u2019s hardly any pressure Cruz can\u2019t shrug off.\n\nLast December, McConnell persuaded him to sign on as vice chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, which works to win Senate races across the country. Not only has Cruz done little in that capacity, he has rankled fellow Republicans by working so closely with outside groups \u2014 including the Senate Conservatives Fund \u2014 that put pressure on GOP incumbents.\n\nBut McConnell can\u2019t strip Cruz of the post without triggering a huge backlash. Nor can he deprive Cruz of committee assignments.\n\nWhen it comes to money, Cruz doesn\u2019t need much help. He got elected with only modest backing from traditional business interests that once held sway within the GOP.\n\nHis broader base of activist-donors pumped $1.2 million into his coffers in the last three months \u2014 not bad for someone whose next election is five years off. Fundraising for a presidential run might be another matter, but that\u2019s not a concern right now for Cruz.\n\n\u201cHis power and his pursuits are not derived from the same place that other people\u2019s are. If you want to go far in the Senate you cannot act like he acts. But he doesn\u2019t want that,\u201d said the strategist with ties to GOP Senate leaders. \u201cWe don\u2019t have anything that he cares about.\u201d\n\nAs Howell put it, \u201cAny attempts to muzzle him are futile. He\u2019s going to do and say what he wants to regardless of what people think.\u201d\n\nSenate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., called Cruz a \u201claughing stock\u201d last week. But that\u2019s not the perception among tea partiers.\n\n\u201cSenator Cruz is trying a new tactic, one so rarely seen in Washington that to many it may seem strange and unfamiliar: He is putting principle above party,\u201d said Catherine Engelbrecht, founder of King Street Patriots, a Houston-area tea party group that will welcome Cruz as a hero Monday night.\n\nJenny Beth Martin, national coordinator of Tea Party Patriots, lauded Cruz for standing up to \u201cthe establishment and the ruling elite in Washington, D.C.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe fight was winnable,\u201d she insisted. Cruz and others have blamed Senate Republicans for not being as willing as those in the House to press the fight.\n\nShe and other fans agree that Cruz is impervious to pressure to conform \u2014 and they hail him for it.\n\n\u201cObviously that\u2019s not his overriding concern is being the most popular guy in the Senate,\u201d Chocola said. \u201cYou can\u2019t bribe people with earmarks anymore. I don\u2019t think Cruz has any problem with fundraising. So what can leadership offer?\u201d\n\nClub for Growth, Cruz\u2019s top contributor, directly gave his campaign $700,000. The group spent $18 million on federal elections last year, including $5 million on a torrent of ads against Cruz\u2019s rival, Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.\n\nThe group raises money from a range of corporate and investment interests. Federal campaign records show that 10 people, topped by PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel, accounted for more than half the $20 million the group raised. Other top donors included a biotech billionaire from Arkansas, Steve Stephens, who chairs the group\u2019s board, and a Boston buyout specialist, John Childs.\n\nAnother arm of the Club for Growth is shielded from having to disclose its donors under federal law.\n\nCruz critics such as Steve Schmidt, who ran Sen. John McCain\u2019s 2008 presidential campaign, find Cruz\u2019s tactics indefensible.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s the architect of this political massacre and the leader of a pack of political lemmings who went over the cliff, following a strategy that had no endgame, that resulting in Obamacare becoming more popular and Republicans becoming less popular,\u201d Schmidt said.\n\nBut he agreed that Cruz seems immune to persuasion or pressure.\n\nCruz and his supporters, Schmidt said, \u201clive in an alternate universe where defeat is victory, and the cause wasn\u2019t Cruz but the weak-kneed Republicans who betrayed Ted Cruz\u2019s courage and sacrifice.\u201d\n\nThe Teflon armor may not come off until the White House race heats up.\n\nCruz\u2019s apparent goal: to position himself as the most pure, most anti-Obamacare, most uncompromising conservative around.\n\n\u201cToday, he\u2019s colorful and quotable, which insulates him to some degree,\u201d said Howell, but \u201cthe barbs will come fast and furious when the White House race gets underway, because he\u2019s not endearing himself to a lot of people.\u201d\n\nFollow Todd J.
