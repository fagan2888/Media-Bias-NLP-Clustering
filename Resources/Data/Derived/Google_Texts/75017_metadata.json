(WNCN) \u2013 A Garner woman is taking it upon herself to find answers for thousands of people struggling with health insurance. Her mission started just this week, but has already gained millions of supporters.\n\nTessa Stanton\u2019s concerns started when her mother was unable to get a much-needed prescription refilled. Stanton soon realized it wasn\u2019t a problem unique to them, but thousands of people across the country.\n\n\u201cThese are people, human beings that are dealing with this that are sick. Our nation is sick. And my mom is sick and I can\u2019t get her the help she needs,\u201d said Stanton.\n\nStanton\u2019s mother, who recently changed insurance to an Affordable Care Act plan, is in the process of moving from Alabama. She\u2019s also battling health issues, so when she started running low on medication, she quickly started looking for a new doctor.\n\n\u201cShe called numerous, numerous offices and they would not take the insurance and they would not tell her why they wouldn\u2019t take it. That\u2019s what was very frustrating,\u201d said Stanton.\n\nWondering if it was a state issue, Stanton called the Alabama Department of Insurance, the state where the plan was purchased.\n\nStanton said, \u201cI called their office to find out you know, what it is that she needs to do with this insurance. And the woman I spoke to was very frustrated. She said she had numerous calls about the same thing. She didn\u2019t have the answers. And the best answer she could give me was to call Obama.\u201d\n\nStanton did call the White House, but wasn\u2019t able to leave a message for Mr. Obama.\n\nAfter that, Stanton had enough. She took to social media, and not only has her video gotten more than 8.5 million views as of Saturday, she\u2019s gotten similar stories from people all over the country. She says it has moved her to do as much as she can to shed some light on health insurance issues.\n\nStanton\u2019s mother was able to find a doctor that would take her insurance, but can\u2019t get in to see them until October. Until then she might just have to go without the medication she needs. In the meantime Stanton is trying to find a different insurance plan for her mother.\n\n\u201cSomething more stable and maybe I can get answers for her,\u201d she said.\n\nWNCN reached out to the provider of the insurance police and the Alabama Department of Insurance, but have not heard back from either organization.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Garner woman is taking it upon herself to find answers for thousands of people struggling with health insurance.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=425414520", "og": {"site_name": "WNCN", "description": "A Garner woman is taking it upon herself to find answers for thousands of people struggling with health insurance.", "title": "Garner woman\u2019s insurance rant video goes viral", "url": "http://wncn.com/2015/08/28/garner-womans-insurance-rant-video-goes-viral/", "image": {"width": 660, "identifier": "https://mgtvwncn.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/garner-insurance.jpg?w=1200", "height": 371}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A Garner woman is taking it upon herself to find answers for thousands of people struggling with health insurance.", "title": "Garner woman\u2019s insurance rant video goes viral", "image": {"src": "https://mgtvwncn.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/garner-insurance.jpg?w=640"}, "creator": "@wncn", "site": "wncn", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "keywords": ",Local news, News, Wake County,By Carleigh Griffeth", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.doapps.android.mln.MLN_4ef95b9ddabd80873ba6a8406f5bfa55", "fb": {"pages": 69688774749}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://wncn.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/caee67290db345cd25db23a5a27c462f?s=16", "application-name": "WNCN", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/WNCNTV", "published_time": "2015-08-29T03:00:27+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-08-30T10:43:03+00:00"}, "msvalidate.01": "25404283363C09DE121A55A903F03873", "google-site-verification": "JziH-ux2vlTCnig0bnUsUMzGF0B1kdNRMW7oV48jIEc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdaf10\"", "article_summary": "GARNER, N.C.
