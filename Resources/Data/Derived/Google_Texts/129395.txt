LINCOLN — The Nebraska Tourism Commission isn’t the only state agency targeting potential tourists.

The State Game and Parks Commission has a new “Time Well Spent’’ campaign aimed at encouraging Nebraskans to create unforgettable memories and opportunities at state parks and recreation areas. The initiative includes billboards, social media and digital, radio and movie theater advertising, said Christy Rasmussen, a commission spokeswoman.

Three billboard images feature a girl walking across a small waterfall, anglers in a lake and a family around a lakeside campfire.

Game and Parks also is running a separate campaign along the Front Range of Colorado to promote outdoor recreation in western Nebraska, especially at Lake McConaughy and reservoirs in the southwest corner of the state.

“Visitation from Colorado is important to the economic vitality of western Nebraska,’’ Rasmussen said.

The McConaughy campaign includes the website golakemac.com, a video, digital ads and Pandora radio advertising.

Game and Parks traditionally runs its own marketing campaigns to meet its specific needs and doesn’t piggyback directly on Tourism Commission branding. The “Time Well Spent” campaign taps research that indicates creating memories outdoors resonates with many people, Rasmussen said.

The two campaigns — developed with the help of Swanson Russell marketing firm in Lincoln and Omaha — come out of an agency marketing budget of less than $200,000. Game and Parks officials declined to specify how much was spent developing the campaigns.

Game and Parks contracted with Swanson Russell this spring for marketing help on an as-needed basis.

The commission is predominately funded by user fees.
