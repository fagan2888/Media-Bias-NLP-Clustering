Tithes (translating to \u201ctenths\u201d) were paid to governments and religious institutions for many thousands of years, since the construction of Stonehenge.\n\nOrthodox Jews, for example, participating in a system referred to as \u201cma\u2019aser kesafim\u201d which paid a sum of one-tenth from their income, believed to be a biblical obligation.\n\nWhile the early church did not mandate taxation, but rather donation, Pope Adrian I appears to have been the first to formally recognize tithing.\n\nA noxious history\u2026\n\nVespasian, or Titus Fl\u0101vius Caesar Vespasi\u0101nus Augustus, as his friends called him, was the Emperor of Rome from 69 AD until his death in 79 AD. Recorded as a witty and charming ruler, Vespasian was believed to be both generous and liberal.\n\nDuring this period, urine\u2026yes, urine\u2026had enormous value. (The New York Subway System would have been a goldmine!) It was an integral part of the tanning of animal skins as urine was used to remove hairs and fibers from the animal\u2019s hide. Waste urine was collected\u2026certainly a commodity one would gratefully part with\u2026and utilized by tanners and tradesman.\n\nVespasian seized upon this opportunity and placed a tax on the collected urine. I shall further refer to this levy as the Pee-Pee Tributum\u2026the use of Latin lends dignity to this tariff.\n\nIronically, the Emperor ultimately succumbed to a nasty bout with diarrhea\u2026a crappy way to go! He insisted that his servants lift him from his bed crying \u201can emperor ought to die standing upright.\u201d Once raised to an upright position, he did just that.\n\nTaxes and levies have been instituted\u2026and rebelled against\u2026since the earliest recorded moments in history.\n\nAs a nation, the United States remained tax-free for her early years\u2026the newly-formed government cautious while recalling the oppressive taxes levied by King George III of England. However, taxation was a common and effective mechanism for nations and rulers to raise funds for the military\u2026for infrastructure\u2026and, of course, for themselves. It was also a mechanism for social and political manipulation.\n\nThe beard tax\u2026\n\nIn 1535, the bearded King of England, Henry VIII, instituted a tax on\u2026beards. The higher one\u2019s social status\u2026the greater the levy. The intention was to make lengthy beards a symbol of status and wealth.\n\nJust prior to the start of the 18th century\u20261698 to be exact, Peter the Great\u2026Emperor of All Russia\u2026Czar Pyotr Alexeyevich, ruler of the Russias\u2026instituted a beard tax\u2026for a very different reason.\n\nPeter was a reformist. His desire was to modernize his nation into one more like those in Western Europe. During his reign, he enhanced the Russian army and navy, gained control over the potent and authoritative Orthodox Church. Peter the Great modernized the alphabet, began utilizing the Julian calendar and created a Senate.\n\nPeter returned from his tour of the great cities of Europe where he observed finely shaven men. Wishing to modernize Russia, Peter ordered all men to shave their beards.\n\nThis is not to say that for a few rubles, one might not overlook the hairy appendage dangling from your face.\n\nPeter\u2026realizing this\u2026recognized that a beard tax could be a \u201cmane\u201d source of income.\n\nSimultaneously (1696)\u2026in England\u2026the King William III needed to raise revenue quickly. Like his contemporary, Peter the Great, William recognized the need for a new levy and the Window Tax was born. (I wonder if William did it out of \u201cjalousie?\u201d)\n\nHomeowners were taxed on a per-window basis\u2026burdening the wealthiest as their homes were largest and contained the greatest number of windows. This tax followed an existing \u201cFireplace Tax\u201d that had been instituted 6 years prior in 1690. (The Fireplace Tax was ultimately repealed in 1689.)\n\nThe Window levy remained in place for over a century and a half\u2026forcing many homeowners to brick-in their windows and altering the manner in which new homes were constructed in England.\n\nBurdening the middle and lower classes, who already struggled without the hardship of additional taxes, the \u201ctax on light and air,\u201d as it was called, was repealed in 1851. (It would be prudent to keep these taxes in mind when one ponders the taxes levied against the colonists later on in the century.)\n\nThe British were far from done\u2026\n\n1789\u2026a tax on purchased candles. Don\u2019t try making them at home! Homemade candles were outlawed unless one obtained a license and paid tax on the subsequently produced candles.\n\n1795 brought a tax on aromatic wig powders. Those wishing to utilize such powder must pay an annual fee. Not repealed until 1869, this duty on hair powder prompted wig-wearers to do without\u2026creating a nation of repulsive and rancid smelling hair-pieces.\n\nNot to be outdone\u2026the Canadian government initiated a Chinese Head Tax.\n\nBeginning in 1885, a tax of 50 dollars was collected from each and every Chinese immigrant wishing to enter Canada. Eventually raised to 100 dollars\u2026then 500 dollars\u2026the levy was roughly equivalent to several years\u2019 earnings at that time. This tax was clearly intended to discourage Chinese immigration as the Chinese population had grown dramatically.\n\nThe majority of Chinese men had come, initially, to build the Canadian Pacific Railway. Once completed, these families formed small, segregated neighborhoods called \u201cChinatowns.\u201d The growth of this population created animosity and resentment and laws were enacted to prevent the Chinese from working in professional vocations such as doctor, lawyer, accountant, etc.\n\nThe Chinese Immigration Act of 1885\u2026also known as the Chinese Head Tax\u2026was meant to dissuade additional Chinese from entering Canada.\n\nCrazy taxes of today\u2026\n\nOne would assume that the aforementioned taxes were merely bizarre footnotes from centuries gone by\u2026irrational rulers\u2026antiquated governmental thinking. Ah\u2026not so fast!\n\nWhen in the Big Apple\u2026beware of the \u201cSliced Bagel Tax.\u201d Should one purchase a bagel in New York\u2026it is purchased tax free. Ask that it be sliced\u2026that bagel is now subject to sales tax.\n\nPassed in 2004, the state of Utah requires the Utah State Tax Commission to collect \u201ca tax assessed in addition to sales and use taxes on admission and user fees, retail sales of tangible personal property including food and drinks, and services occurring in a business with nude or partially nude individuals.\n\nThe \u201cNudity Tax\u201d is designated to offset the costs of providing treatment for convicted sex-offenders.\n\nIllinois and Kentucky collect additional taxes for candy. Within Chicago city limits, bottled soda is taxed merely 3%\u2026but if the soda is served from soda fountain\u20269%.\n\nIn Durham, North Carolina, expect to pay a tax on your dog\u2026$10 if spayed or neutered\u2026$75 if Fido is \u201cstill intact.\u201d\n\nWant that \u201cout in the sun\u201d look? The Patient Protections and Affordable Care Act of 2010 charges a 10% tax on tanning!\n\nScreeeeeetch! Boooom! Involved in a motor vehicle accident? Many states are now charging a \u201cCrash Tax\u201d should emergency vehicles need to respond to your traffic incident.\n\nI could continue\u2026forever. Here\u2019s one for the road:\n\nKeeping in mind that the state of New York does not collect taxes for musicals\u2026for operas\u2026for musical comedies. However, should you operate a \u201chaunted house\u201d attraction\u2026charge more than 10 cents admission and play music throughout the attraction\u2026yes, you\u2019re subject to taxation.\n\nSeriously?\n\nThe Naples Herald welcomes your comments, thoughts and concerns!
