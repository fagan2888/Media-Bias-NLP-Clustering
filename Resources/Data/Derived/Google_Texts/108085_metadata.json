Rather than deny the shift, or stop at trying to reverse it in legislatures, the courts and at ballot boxes, conservatives are instead attempting to erect a legal architecture that will wall them off from the growing portion of American society that supports equal rights for gay people. The idea is to use their putative religious beliefs to exempt themselves from broadly-applicable laws when those laws reflect a zeitgeist that offends them \u2014 or, as former-Business Insider writer Josh Barro put it, to create \u201ca special new right to discriminate on a particular basis.\u201d\n\nThe good news is that these efforts aren\u2019t exactly flourishing. John McCain hasn\u2019t been anyone\u2019s idea of an ally to LGBT people\u2026.\n\n\u2026.and if he\u2019s against a bill like this in Arizona, then it stands to reason that Republican statewide officials elsewhere won\u2019t be supporting similar measures.\n\nThe bad news is that this phenomenon isn\u2019t limited to homophobia, and doesn\u2019t always masquerade as an exercise of religious freedom. As America grows more liberal, conservatives are retreating into a variety of interlinking, but isolated subcultures and, when necessary, making or manipulating law to insulate themselves from contact with the masses. Like a cultural manifestation of Going Galt. Welcome to white America\u2019s waiver society.\n\nWe\u2019ve already belabored the right\u2019s parallel argument that religious owners of businesses should be exempt from the Affordable Care Act\u2019s contraception mandate. That argument\u2019s much more widely accepted on the right than is the recent push for state-based anti-gay \u201crights\u201d bills, but it\u2019s actually identical in construct to the argument that religious individuals and businesses ought to be free to discriminate against gay couples or any number of other people. McCain and Flake may not have thought it all the way through, but if they believe religious business owners should be inherently exempt from certain ACA requirements they have no basis for opposing the Arizona bill other than to argue that it isn\u2019t actually necessary.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Rather than deny America's cultural shifts, conservatives have a new strategy: exemption from laws that offend them VIDEO", "title": "White America\u2019s \u201cwaiver mania\u201d: The right\u2019s plot to minimize its culture war defeat", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Rather than deny America's cultural shifts, conservatives have a new strategy: exemption from laws that offend them VIDEO", "title": "White America\u2019s \u201cwaiver mania\u201d: The right\u2019s plot to minimize its culture war defeat", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/02/25/white_americas_waiver_mania_the_rights_plot_to_minimize_its_culture_war_defeat/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2011/11/jan.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Rather than deny America's cultural shifts, conservatives have a new strategy: exemption from laws that offend them VIDEO", "title": "White America\u2019s \u201cwaiver mania\u201d: The right\u2019s plot to minimize its culture war defeat", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2011/11/jan.jpg", "creator": "@brianbeutler", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Brian Beutler", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Affordable Care Act, Birth Control, Contraception, Editor's Picks, Gay Marriage, Gay Rights, Jan Brewer, Jeff Flake, John McCain, Obamacare, Stand Your Ground laws, Video", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd24f0\"", "article_summary": "We\u2019ve already belabored the right\u2019s parallel argument that religious owners of businesses should be exempt from the Affordable Care Act\u2019s contraception mandate.\nThe bad news is that this phenomenon isn\u2019t limited to homophobia, and doesn\u2019t always masquerade as an exercise of religious freedom.\n\u2026.and if he\u2019s against a bill like this in Arizona, then it stands to reason that Republican statewide officials elsewhere won\u2019t be supporting similar measures.\nWelcome to white America\u2019s waiver society.\nJohn McCain hasn\u2019t been anyone\u2019s idea of an ally to LGBT people\u2026."}
