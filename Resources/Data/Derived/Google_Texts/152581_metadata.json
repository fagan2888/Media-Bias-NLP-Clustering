Al Franken, D-Minn., playing the role of \u201celf,\u201d MSNBC reported.\n\nCompany\u2019s amazing response to angry customer\n\nblows up web, sends sales skyrocketing\n\nAnd this year, Rubio\u2019s name was drawn by U.S. Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., who saw fit to give the Florida freshman a lump of coal \u2014 as in a small statue made of coal, according to The Hill.\n\n\u201cI had Marco Rubio, and we gave him a coal figurine of an elephant and a donkey,\u201d Manchin told the Washington Post last week. \u201cAnd the donkey came with a little bit of repairs needed, so I had to deliver the elephant yesterday, and I\u2019ll get the donkey to him.\u201d\n\nNo truth to the rumor that the donkey figurine was made by the same company that launched the Obamacare website.\n\nCoal has always been a big part of West Virginia\u2019s economy \u2014 the Obama administration \u201cwar on coal\u201d notwithstanding \u2014 and the state has the largest coal mining industry in the country.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want to forget what keeps the lights on and what keeps the country running and what\u2019s made this country and is still very much a part of this country,\u201d Manchin said.\n\nHere are a few of the gifts that were exchanged, as reported by MSNBC:\n\nSen. Franken gave his colleague, Sen. Joe Donnelly, a hand-drawn map of the United States that focused on the states that played a role in Donnelly\u2019s life.\n\nSen. John Boozman gifted Sen. Tim Kaine jam and jellies made by House of Webster in Rogers, Arkansas.\n\nSen. Johnny Isakson gave Sen.
