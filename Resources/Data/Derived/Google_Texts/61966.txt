A couple dozen people rallied Saturday on the corner of East Speedway and North Euclid Avenue in support of the Islamic Center of Tucson even though the initial event that drew them to the area had been canceled.

The Stand Up Against Hate rally moved away from the mosque after participants learned event organizer Dean Remington had called off his Let Freedom Ring Rally.

Irfan Sheikh said he was happy to see so many non-Muslims mixed into the crowd Saturday. Even though he does not attend the ICT, Sheikh said he wanted to be in the area in case people still showed up for the canceled rally.

"We know we have differences, but we agree that we are going to live together," Sheikh said of the people marching alongside him. "We are going to like each other, love each other and protect each other."

Sarah Murdoch, who held a sign condemning ISIS not Islam, said she works within a few hundred feet of the ICT. Even though the center was closed Saturday, Murdoch said she wanted everyone to know she's taking a stand against hatred and bigotry.

"The people that I serve that come from the mosque are the most amazing, heartwarming, beautiful people I've ever seen in my life," she said. "It's still important to have a sense of community and a sense of being among everybody."

Police cars patrolled the ICT and nearby rally Saturday afternoon. By the end of the night, the ICT remained closed.
