(Photo: Associated Press )\n\nThe Iowa Department of Corrections will renew or rebid its prison phone services contract in October. We encourage the department to enter into a contract that does not include commission payments and is based on the lowest cost to the call recipients \u2014 typically prisoners\u2019 family members \u2014 as eight other states have already done.\n\nI realize that the Department of Corrections receives about $650,972 in annual prison phone commission revenue, which is mainly generated from prisoners\u2019 families who accept collect calls, pay for calls from their prepaid accounts or send money to their incarcerated family members for their debit phone accounts.\n\nWhile the revenue from commissions likely funds many worthwhile programs, there is no legitimate reason why such programs should be funded largely by prisoners\u2019 families and friends through inflated phone rates.\n\nWhen rebidding its prison phone contract, the department has the opportunity to become the next state to forgo commissions and institute lower phone rates. States that have banned such commissions include California, New York, Michigan, New Mexico, South Carolina, Nebraska, Missouri and Rhode Island.\n\nLower phone rates facilitate greater communication between prisoners and their families, which, research has shown, has a rehabilitative effect and results in decreased recidivism. In the words of the nation\u2019s largest prison phone company, Global Tel-Link: \u201cStudies and reports continue to support that recidivism can be significantly reduced by regular connection and communications between inmates, families and friends \u2014 13 percent reduction in felony reconviction and a 25 percent reduction in technical violations.\u201d\n\nFurther, practices that \u201cfacilitate and strengthen family connections during incarceration\u201d can \u201creduce the strain of parental separation, reduce recidivism rates, and increase the likelihood of successful re-entry\u201d of prisoners, according to a 2005 report by the Re-Entry Policy Council.\n\nA 2004 study by the Urban Institute found \u201cIt is evident that family support, when it exists, is a strong asset that can be brought to the table in the re-entry planning process.\u201d As many prisoners are housed far from their families, phone calls provide such support.\n\nIndeed, for many prisoners, phone calls to their family and children are the primary means of maintaining family ties and parental relationships. According to the Department of Justice, an estimated 2.7 million U.S. children have an incarcerated parent.\n\nThis is recognized by the Federal Bureau of Prisons: \u201cTelephone privileges are a supplemental means of maintaining community and family ties that will contribute to an inmate\u2019s personal development ... a valuable tool in the overall correctional process.\u201d\n\nWhen the Iowa Department of Corrections renews or rebids its prison phone services contract, it should give serious consideration to forgoing commission revenue in whole or part and should place the greatest emphasis for the contract on the lowest overall cost of prison phone calls.\n\nTHE AUTHOR:\n\nDAVID GANIM is the national prison phone justice director for the Human Rights Defense Center in Lake Worth, Fla.
