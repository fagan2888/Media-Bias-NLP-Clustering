One man was hospitalized Sunday evening after running his ATV off of Shinewell Rd. just north of Haworth in McCurtain County.

Billy Jones, 25, of Broken Bow, was transported to St. Michael's Hospital in Texarkana, Texas and admitted in stable condition with a head injury. Darrell Clark, 27, was also on the vehicle, but was unharmed.

Police say that Jones was driving westbound on Shinewell when he departed the roadway to the left and struck a bridge. The ATV then continued another 300 feet down the road and overturned 3 1/2 times before coming to a rest on its side.

Police cited an unsafe speed and the odor of alcohol on the scene. Seatbelts were equipped but not in use.
