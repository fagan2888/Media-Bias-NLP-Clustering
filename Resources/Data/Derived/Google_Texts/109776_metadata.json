And although proponents of marriage equality may cheer a decision along these lines when it is delivered, the expansion of the constitutional right to dignity may produce far-reaching consequences that they will later have cause to regret. The oral arguments at the Supreme Court on Tuesday made clear that Justice Anthony Kennedy\u2019s biggest contribution to the gay-marriage debate is his expansion of constitutional protections for the right to dignity. Justice Kennedy invoked the word \u201cdignity\u201d five times in the oral arguments; and other lawyers invoked it 16 times. It was central to the opening statements of Solicitor General Don Verrilli. \u201cThe opportunity to marry is integral to human dignity,\u201d he began. \u201cExcluding gay and lesbian couples from marriage demeans the dignity of these couples.\u201d It was also one of the first words uttered by the plaintiff\u2019s lawyer, Mary L. Bonuato. \u201cIf a legal commitment, responsibility and protection that is marriage is off limits to gay people as a class,\u201d she said, \u201cthe stain of unworthiness that follows on individuals and families contravenes the basic constitutional commitment to equal dignity.\u201d\n\nAlthough the word dignity has appeared in more than 900 Supreme Court opinions, Justice Kennedy, as Kenji Yoshino of NYU has noted, has been especially drawn to it. He has referred to \u201cdignity\u201d in cases ranging from partial-birth abortions to prisons. As Yoshino puts it, \u201cWhen Justice Kennedy ascribes dignity to an entity, that entity generally prevails.\u201d Kennedy\u2019s recognition of the dignity interests of LGBT couples has been influential in persuading lower court judges to strike down bans on same-sex marriage. But although Kennedy\u2019s description of the dignitary interests of LGBT couples is inspiring, and it accurately describes their social experience, the roots of the right to dignity in constitutional text, history, and tradition are harder to discern. Kennedy first drew a clear connection between \u201cpersonal dignity and autonomy\u201d and laws regulating personal relationships such as marriage in the 1992 Casey decision, which upheld the core of Roe v. Wade: Our law affords constitutional protection to personal decisions relating to marriage, procreation, contraception, family relationships, child rearing, and education \u2026 These matters, involving the most intimate and personal choices a person may make in a lifetime, choices central to personal dignity and autonomy, are central to the liberty protected by the Fourteenth Amendment. At the heart of liberty is the right to define one's own concept of existence, of meaning, of the universe, and of the mystery of human life. Beliefs about these matters could not define the attributes of personhood were they formed under compulsion of the State. When Justice Kennedy later invoked this idea of dignity to overturn laws banning same-sex intimacy in the 2003 Lawrence case, Justice Scalia ridiculed his opinion in Casey as the \u201cfamed sweet-mystery-of-life passage.\u201d Despite Scalia\u2019s mocking tone, he was correct to note that Kennedy\u2019s constitutionalizing of a right to dignity expanded the already amorphous right to privacy recognized in Roe v. Wade, which itself had tenuous constitutional roots. By rooting the right to dignity in a synthesis of the textually enumerated rights of equality and liberty, Kennedy laid the groundwork for judges to review laws that inflicted dignitary harm with skepticism, regardless of proof of intentional animus and regardless of whether the victim of discrimination was considered a \u201csuspect class.\u201d\n\nA range of liberal scholars recognized the sweeping implications of Kennedy\u2019s new synthesis of dignity with liberty and equality, from Robert Post (who observed that in Lawrence, the Court relied on \u201cthemes of respect and stigma ... traditionally associated with equal protection\u201d) to Laurence H. Tribe (who described a \u201cSubstantive due process-equal protection synthesis,\u201d and the relationship between the two as a \u201cdouble helix\u201d) to William N. Eskridge (who called the connection between liberty and equality a \u201cjurisprudence of tolerance\u201d). But in discussing the dignitary interest that emerges from the equality and liberty clauses, all of these scholars relied on the same highly abstract penumbral reasoning that had proven so controversial in the cases leading up to Roe v. Wade. In other words, the kind of liberties that the Framers had in mind when they framed the Fourth Amendment (the liberty of the home) were very different, and far more specific, than the broad right to be free to define your own identity without being demeaned by the state or by fellow citizens that Kennedy recognized in Lawrence. Kennedy made another crucial move in Lawrence, concluding that an individual\u2019s interest in dignity trumps the majority\u2019s interest in preserving traditional moral values. \u201cThe fact that the governing majority in a State has traditionally viewed a particular practice as immoral is not a sufficient reason for upholding a law prohibiting the practice,\u201d Kennedy held. \u201cThis effectively decrees the end of all morals legislation,\u201d Justice Scalia fulminated, and he predicted the demise of \u201cstate laws against bigamy, same-sex marriage, adult incest, prostitution, masturbation, adultery, fornication, bestiality, and obscenity.\u201d In fact, Scalia\u2019s prediction may prove to be correct. His question about why the state\u2019s police power to protect public morals\u2014taken for granted from the founding era until the Lawrence case\u2014was suddenly a violation of the Constitution remains valid and unanswered. In Lawrence, Scalia also predicted that the new dignitary right would lead inevitably to the recognition of same-sex marriage, despite Kennedy\u2019s protestations to the contrary (\u201cDo not believe it,\u201d Scalia wrote). As Scalia understood, without moral disapproval as a permissible state interest, the other interests the state offered to ban same-sex unions were hard to credit. Here is Scalia\u2019s prescient observation: If moral disapprobation of homosexual conduct is \u201cno legitimate state interest\u201d for purposes of proscribing that conduct; and if, as the Court coos (casting aside all pretense of neutrality), \u201c[w]hen sexuality finds overt expression in intimate conduct with another person, the conduct can be but one element in a personal bond that is more enduring,\u201d what justification could there possibly be for denying the benefits of marriage to homosexual couples exercising \u201c[t]he liberty protected by the Constitution?\u201d \u201cSurely not the encouragement of procreation,\u201d Scalia concluded, \u201csince the sterile and the elderly are allowed to marry.\u201d\n\nIn other words, despite Ohio\u2019s attempt to resurrect the encouragement of procreation as a justification for same-sex marriage bans in the recent arguments\u2014a justification dismantled by Justices Kagan and Sotomayor\u2014Scalia beat them to the punch by more than a decade. In addition to sincere moral disapproval of homosexuality by some religious people, there is one other main reason that voters have passed same-sex marriage bans in the past few years: a desire to preserve tradition. But the Supreme Court ruled that reason out of bounds in United States v. Virginia in 1996, when it held that a desire to preserve tradition for its own sake was a \u201cnotably circular argument\u201d that could not survive constitutional scrutiny. Since these two arguments\u2014moral disapproval or preserving tradition\u2014are the real reasons most voters have for supporting gay marriage bans, opponents of gay marriage were forced to offer implausible reasons\u2014such as promoting \u201cresponsible procreation\u201d by straight people\u2014which, as Justice Kagan\u2019s questioning suggested, are hard to credit because they are essentially made up for the purposes of litigation. * * * Justice Kennedy\u2019s broad constitutionalizing of a right to dignity has boxed in gay marriage opponents with its scope and breadth. Chief Justice Roberts tried to narrow the implications of the Lawrence decision in the oral arguments yesterday by suggesting that in that case, \u201cthe whole argument is the State cannot intrude on that personal relationship. This, it seems to me, is different in that what the argument is [today] is the State must sanction. It must approve the relationship. They\u2019re two different questions.\u201d But Solicitor General Verrilli resisted the attempt to narrow the dignitary implications of Lawrence. \u201cLawrence catalyzed for our society,\u201d he replied. \u201cIt put gay and lesbian couples, gay and lesbian people, in a position for the first time in our history to be able to lay claim to the abiding promise of the Fourteenth Amendment in a way that was just impossible when they were marginalized and ostracized.\u201d\n\nVerrilli\u2019s insight that denial of marriage benefits to gays and lesbians could demean and ostracize them, and violate their dignity, was confirmed by Justice Kennedy\u2019s opinion the Windsor case from 2013, striking down the federal Defense of Marriage Act. According to Kennedy, DOMA\u2019s history of enactment and its own text demonstrate that interference with the equal dignity of same-sex marriages was \u201cthe essence\u201d of its effects on gay people. I won\u2019t rehearse here the objections to reading the text and history of the Constitution at such a high level of generality; with this approach, the connections to the specific concerns that animated the framers is hard to discern. Suffice it to say that Justice Louis Brandeis, the greatest defender of the right to privacy in U.S. history, originally tried to persuade courts to recognize a new right to dignity, after confessing that American law, unlike Roman and European law, had not, traditionally protected offenses against honor and dignity. But, as Neal Richards demonstrates in Intellectual Privacy, Brandeis changed his mind about the wisdom of constitutionalizing a right to dignity\u2014defined as the right to restrain the press from publishing truthful but embarrassing information about celebrities\u2014after concluding that it clashed with the First Amendment guarantees of free press and free expression. Instead, Brandeis came to embrace a more carefully defined notion of intellectual privacy and freedom of thought and belief, more closely rooted in the text of the First Amendment itself. There is no doubt that Justice Kennedy accurately and movingly describes the indignity and stigma that bans on same sex marriage impose on the right of LGBT citizens to define their own identities and to claim the benefits of equal citizenship. But constitutionalizing that injury with broad abstractions like dignity may lead to results in the future that liberals come to regret. Already, the European Court of Justice\u2019s recognition of a sweeping \u201cRight to be Forgotten\u201d on the Internet has lead to the most dramatic clash between European traditions of protecting dignity and American traditions of protecting free speech in a generation.", "article_metadata": {"description": "It may provide support for same-sex marriage, but it also empowers judges to decide whose &#39;dignity&#39; they wish to prioritize.", "author": "Jeffrey Rosen", "og": {"site_name": "The Atlantic", "description": "Expanding the constitutional right to dignity may produce far-reaching consequences that progressives will later have cause to regret.", "title": "The Danger of the Supreme Court Upholding the Dignity of Gay Marriage", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2015/04/RTX1APFH/lead_large.jpg", "url": "http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/04/the-dangerous-doctrine-of-dignity/391796/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "theatlantic.com", "site": "@theatlantic", "card": "summary"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "p": {"domain_verify": "68e1a0361a557708fefc992f3309ed70"}, "fb": {"admins": "577048155,17301937", "page_id": 29259828486, "app_id": 100770816677686}, "keywords": "The Atlantic, The Atlantic Magazine, TheAtlantic.com, Atlantic, news, opinion, breaking news, analysis, commentary, business, politics, culture, international, science, technology, national and life", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, width=device-width, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "Justice Kennedy invoked the word \u201cdignity\u201d five times in the oral arguments; and other lawyers invoked it 16 times.\n* * * Justice Kennedy\u2019s broad constitutionalizing of a right to dignity has boxed in gay marriage opponents with its scope and breadth.\nIf the Supreme Court strikes down same-sex marriage bans, it may well do so on the grounds that they violate the dignity of gay couples.\nBut constitutionalizing that injury with broad abstractions like dignity may lead to results in the future that liberals come to regret.\nAs Yoshino puts it, \u201cWhen Justice Kennedy ascribes dignity to an entity, that entity generally prevails.\u201d Kennedy\u2019s recognition of the dignity interests of LGBT couples has been influential in persuading lower court judges to strike down bans on same-sex marriage."}
