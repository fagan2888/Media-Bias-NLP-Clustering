(AP) - Wyoming Democrats now have their champion: Pete Gosar announced Saturday that he\u2019s stepping down as state party chairman and will run for governor.\n\nGosar, 46, made his announcement Saturday at the Democratic Party convention in Rock Springs. His move fills a major void in the roster of a state political party that has seen increasing difficulty drawing viable candidates in statewide races.\n\nGosar, who grew up in Pinedale the son of an oilfield worker, said in his campaign announcement that he\u2019s old enough now to look back on his life and see the people who have helped make his life easier. Those who paved the way for him were those who made pragmatism something to be honored in Wyoming and who had common decency and fairness, he said.\n\n\u201cI have appreciated your support for many years, and I look forward to being your next governor,\u201d Gosar told a crowd of scores of delegates at a hotel ballroom.\n\nGosar ran for governor in 2010. He lost in the Democratic primary to Leslie Petersen, who likewise had resigned from her post as chairwoman of the state party to run. Peterson went on to lose in the general election roughly three-to-one to Gov. Matt Mead, who\u2019s now seeking re-election.\n\nSpeaking after his campaign announcement, Gosar said he intends to focus on educational issues in his campaign. \u201cIt\u2019s been disarray, and the governor\u2019s played a role,\u201d he said of the state education department.\n\nGosar said he believes he has time to mount an effective campaign in the governor\u2019s race. He\u2019s motivated by people he\u2019s met recently who were denied health insurance under the federal Medicaid program because the Wyoming Legislature opted again this year not to accept the federal government\u2019s offer to expand the program, he said.\n\nExpanding Medicaid is a cornerstone principle of the federal Affordable Care Act. Early in his term, Mead steered Wyoming into an unsuccessful legal challenge of the entire law. Mead has opposed Medicaid expansion since then, saying he doesn\u2019t trust federal promises to continue to pick up the bulk of the cost of adding more people to the insurance program.\n\n\u201cWhen there\u2019s no good reason for bad public policy, someone has to answer for that,\u201d Gosar said. \u201cThe governor deserves some blame for that. There\u2019s no doubt that if the governor would have come out in favor of some sort of Medicaid expansion that it would have passed.\u201d\n\nGosar received his pilot training at a community college in New Mexico. He also was a high school teacher and coach in Pinedale. He played football as a walk-on at the University of Wyoming from 1986-1990. He was a two-time academic all-Western Athletic Conference honoree.\n\nGosar works for the state as a pilot and runs an aviation business with his brother. It\u2019s unclear whether he will take a leave from his state job during the campaign, he said.\n\nWyoming Democrats haven\u2019t held a statewide office since former Gov. Dave Freudenthal ended his second term nearly four years ago.\n\nEven with Gosar\u2019s announcement, Wyoming Democrats still have a major void in their lineup of candidates with less than two weeks to go for candidates to file.\n\nRobin Van Ausdall, executive director of the Wyoming Democratic Party, said Saturday that she\u2019s heard of no Democratic candidates coming forward to challenge Rep. Cynthia Lummis, R-Wyoming. Lummis last month announced she\u2019s seeking re-election to a fourth term to the state\u2019s lone seat in the U.S. House of Representatives.\n\nWith registered Republicans outnumbering Democrats roughly three-to-one, Van Ausdall said mounting a competitive, statewide congressional campaign would be a daunting challenge.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re running against incumbents who have millions in the bank,\u2019 Van Ausdall said. \u201cThey have a lot of support from national, out-of-state interests. It\u2019s a lot.\u201d\n\nBut all those daunting disadvantages aren\u2019t stopping Charlie Hardy, a former priest, running as a Democrat against incumbent Sen. Mike Enzi, R-Wyo.\n\n\u201cI have 75 years of accumulated youth, and I\u2019m not going to stop being a person for the people,\u201d Hardy said. \u201cI\u2019m thinking about challenging Sen. Enzi to a 10-kilometer race.\u201d\n\nHardy said Wyoming Democrats won\u2019t have the well-funded campaign chest that Republicans have. But he added: \u201cWe have heart in our human chests. That\u2019s more important, and that\u2019s the way we\u2019re going to win.\u201d\n\nThe Wyoming Republican Party has suffered deep divisions over a bill the Legislature passed and that Mead signed last year. The law stripped the superintendent\u2019s office of most of its powers and vested them instead in a director appointed by the governor. The state Supreme Court early this year ruled the law was unconstitutional.\n\nSuperintendent of Public Instruction Cindy Hill is challenging Mead for the Republican nomination in the governor\u2019s race this year along with retired Cheyenne physician Taylor Haynes.\n\nMany state lawmakers, including its Republican leadership, said they wanted to reorganize the state\u2019s educational system because they were dissatisfied with Hill\u2019s response to legislative directives. The state spends heavily on K-12 education, but many lawmakers have said they don\u2019t believe test scores and other measures of student achievement reflected that investment.\n\nRepublican delegates came close at their state convention in early May in Evanston to approving a censure motion against Mead that accused him of acting unconstitutionally in approving last year\u2019s education reform bill.\n\nVan Ausdall said she believes that the Democratic Party can capitalize on divisions within the Republican ranks this year.\n\nMike Ceballos, 58, of Cheyenne, a former executive with Qwest Communications, is running as a Democrat for state superintendent of public instruction.\n\n\u201cWithin the last three years, I have been mad, frustrated,\u201d Ceballos said. \u201cAnd the biggest thing is that this has just been unnecessary. We can\u2019t afford to let that go on for the next four years, so in January we need to make a change.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Wyoming Democrats now have their champion: Pete Gosar announced Saturday that he's stepping down as state party chairman and will run for governor.", "Author": "BEN NEARY", "og": {"url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/may/17/wyoming-dems-look-for-candidates/", "type": "article", "site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Wyoming Democrats now have their champion: Pete Gosar announced Saturday that he\u2019s stepping down as state party chairman and will run for governor.", "title": "Pete Gosar announces run for Wyoming governor"}, "twitter": {"title": "Pete Gosar announces run for Wyoming governor", "description": "Wyoming Democrats now have their champion: Pete Gosar announced Saturday that he's stepping down as state party chairman and will run for governor.", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "news_keywords": "Politics, Pete Gosar, Matt Mead, Democratic Party"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdec66\"", "article_summary": "(AP) - Wyoming Democrats now have their champion: Pete Gosar announced Saturday that he\u2019s stepping down as state party chairman and will run for governor.\nRobin Van Ausdall, executive director of the Wyoming Democratic Party, said Saturday that she\u2019s heard of no Democratic candidates coming forward to challenge Rep.
