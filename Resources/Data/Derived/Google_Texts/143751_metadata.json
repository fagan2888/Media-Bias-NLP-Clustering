AMC offering movie pass in Denver\n\nDENVER \u2014 Could the Netflix model work for a movie theater chain?\n\nAMC Theaters is reportedly exploring that with a pilot partnership with MoviePass, a company which offers a subscription service where movie lovers can attend a movie a day for a monthly fee.\n\nAMC operates more than 4,900 screens across the United States, making it the second largest theater chain behind Regal Entertainment.\n\nThe New York Times reports that moviegoers would pay a fee of $35 a month, which would allow them a pass to attend one showing a day of any movie they choose. A $45 per month option includes 3D and IMAX films.\n\nAMC theaters in Boston and Denver will begin offering the pass in January.\n\nMoviePass launched back in 2011 and AMC decided to partner with the company in response to the decline in attendance by young moviegoers.\n\nAccording to Nielsen\u2019s 2014 Moviegoing Report, which was released last week, audiences between the ages of 12 and 24 years old saw an average of 7.1 movies \u2014 a decrease of 15.5% from last year\u2019s report.\n\n\u201cMillennials are consuming things differently, and that includes going to the movies,\u201d MoviePass\u2019s chief executive and co-founder Stacy Spikes told the Times.\n\nYounger people are already enthusiastic users of subscription services like Netflix for movies and Spotify for music, which allows them to consume what they want, when they want.\n\n\u201cIt frankly wouldn\u2019t be smart to ignore the success of subscription in other areas of media,\u201d Christina Sternberg, the senior vice president for corporate strategy at AMC, told The Times.\n\nA movie a day might keep the lagging box office numbers away. The industry had a less than stellar summer blockbuster season.\n\nThe new pilot program will be rolled out in January in Denver and Boston. Other cities will be added based on the rate of success in the initial markets.", "article_metadata": {"description": "DENVER -- Could the Netflix model work for a movie theater chain?
