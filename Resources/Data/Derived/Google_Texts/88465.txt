Many Kansans celebrated Fourth of July on a boat or at a back yard party, but every year one group of veterans spends this holiday honoring the true meaning of Independence Day.

Dozens of past and present military men and women gathered together at Veterans' Memorial Park to reflect on those who've served.

"I always come down here, mainly to remember those who can't be here," says Loren Tracy, a Korean War veteran.

Fourth of July takes Tracy back to his days in the Marines.

"This is what all these wars are about, is preserving our independence which was bought at a high price right from the start," he says.

Tracy says it's important to celebrate the holiday with veterans who served during times of war and peace.

"We have a brotherhood," he says. "We know what price was paid and we like to pass that on to young people because very possible they'll be called to do the same thing."

Kurt Peckenschneider is one of those who enlisted when America wasn't at war.

"I felt as an American after I got out of high school I just felt that it was incumbent upon me to serve my country," he says.

Peckenschneider believes today isn't about baseball games and barbeques, it's about saluting the brave who make this the land of the free.

"Today is the extent of my celebration on this day and it's the memory of our founding fathers, soldiers at the time and they decided to break free and that's what this day is in memory of," says Peckenschneider.

There are around 221,000 veterans living in Kansas.
