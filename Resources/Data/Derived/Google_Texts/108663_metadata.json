Health insurance obtained through the Affordable Care Act could \u201csave them and their families from bankruptcy.\u201d\n\nSure, millennials are often the healthiest members of the population, and they may believe they\u2019re invincible. It\u2019s estimated as many as 16 million don\u2019t have adequate insurance. But a broken bone or a middle-of-the-night appendicitis attack can wreck a 20-something\u2019s financial future.\n\nWe know: My college-student daughter\u2019s minor surgery, done as an outpatient in April, would have cost $30,000 if she hadn\u2019t been covered on my husband\u2019s insurance (an early perk of the Affordable Care Act has allowed 2.5 million adult children up to age 26 who otherwise wouldn\u2019t have insurance to remain on their parents\u2019 policies). Even with the policy, the bills have amounted to nearly $3,000 for out-of-pocket expenses.\n\nYet an activist group called Generation Opportunity, with funding ties to the conservative Koch Brothers, claims on its Web site that \u201cthere are better, cheaper options\u201d than the Affordable Care Act for fellow millennials. The group fails to list what those choices might be.\n\nThe Virginia-based group, which is responsible for the Uncle Sam videos, has announced a $750,000 effort to persuade young adults \u201cto opt out\u201d of using the soon-to-be-available health exchanges or health insurance marketplace to buy policies from private companies. As part of that campaign, the group will take its show on the road to some 20 college campuses across the country.\n\n\u201cWe want young people to know they have options \u2014 including the ability to opt out of Obamacare by paying a relatively small penalty,\u201d Evan Feinberg, president of Generation Opportunity, said in a news release. That penalty will be $95, or 1 percent of income, in 2014; it will gradually increase.\n\nFeinberg refers to Obamacare as a \u201cquite frankly, creepy pyramid scheme\u201d and explains that his group is \u201crelying on creativity and grassroots activism\u201d to fight it.\n\nI guess you could call the Uncle Sam ads, which were posted on YouTube Thursday and have since gone viral, as \u201ccreative.\u201d\n\nIn one ad, Uncle Sam pops up at the foot of an exam table while a young woman has her legs in the stirrups (a vulnerable position, believe me). She screams and on the screen flash the words, \u201cDon\u2019t let government play doctor.\u201d Then we\u2019re treated to a close-up of Uncle Sam brandishing a speculum.\n\nIn the other video, it\u2019s the young man\u2019s turn, looking worried (a lot of jaw-clenching going on) as he lies on his side, knees to his chest, his backside exposed. Uncle Sam magically appears, snaps on a pair of blue rubber gloves and wriggles his fingers in anticipation.\n\nIrony, anyone? Hasn\u2019t it been members of the Republican Party playing doctor by passing legislation in a number of states requiring any woman considering an abortion to undergo an ultrasound with a transvaginal probe \u2014 a most invasive and uncomfortable procedure?\n\nThe plan is simple for Generation Opportunity. They hope to undermine Obamacare by underfunding the program. The White House has estimated that at least 2.7 million of the 7 million people expected to sign up for health insurance through the health exchanges need to be young adults. If enough healthy, young adults fail to buy private insurance through the health exchanges, the companies will lack the funds to pay out claims for older and often sicker customers.\n\nBut will it be that easy to win over the hearts and minds \u2014 and wallets \u2014 of the millennials? More than 27 percent of adults age 18 to 24 have no health insurance. But the idea that most of them believe they don\u2019t need it may be just another myth, like so much of the misinformation on the Affordable Care Act.\n\nOnly a fourth of them think they\u2019re healthy enough that they don\u2019t need health insurance, according to research by the Kaiser Foundation, while a study by the Commonwealth Fund found that the majority of adults age 30 and under would buy insurance if they could afford it.\n\nBecause of Obamacare, preexisting conditions will no longer prevent some young adults from purchasing a policy. \u201cIn the past, a teenage girl could take Accutane for acne and then be denied health insurance for a preexisting condition,\u201d Sebelius said.\n\nOr, as she explained earlier during the \u201cMental Health Matters\u201d conference to enthusiastic applause, \u201cBeing a woman is no longer considered a preexisting condition.\u201d\n\nI can\u2019t help but compare health insurance and auto insurance. We\u2019re required in many states to show proof of car insurance before we can get a license for the vehicle. And most of us would never dream of buying a nice car \u2014 but then refusing to get insurance.\n\nOr what about telling our kids to forego insurance? \u201cHey, Junior, you\u2019re such a good driver, don\u2019t waste your money buying an insurance policy. You won\u2019t need it.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius finds the message \"disturbing\" in ads targeted at young adults to opt-out of Obamacare.", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius finds the message \"disturbing\" in ads targeted at young adults to opt-out of Obamacare.", "title": "\u2018Creepy\u2019 Uncle Sam asks young adults to opt out of Obamacare", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/she-the-people/wp/2013/09/23/creepy-uncle-sam-asks-young-adults-to-opt-out-of-obamacare/", "image": "https://images.washingtonpost.com/?url=http://img.washingtonpost.com/blogs/she-the-people/files/2013/09/creepy-uncle-sam-300x300.jpg&w=1484&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@dianareese"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/she-the-people/wp/2013/09/23/creepy-uncle-sam-asks-young-adults-to-opt-out-of-obamacare/", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "Obamacare, Uncle Sam Koch Brothers, Generation Opportunity, Affordable Care Act,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "Obamacare, Uncle Sam Koch Brothers, Generation Opportunity, Affordable Care Act,"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2220\"", "article_summary": "\u201cYoung adults are one diagnosis, one motorcycle accident, one car accident away from a lifetime of [medical] bills,\u201d Sebelius said.\nA \u201ccreepy\u201d Uncle Sam says opt out of Obamacare.\n\u201cCreepy.\u201dThat\u2019s the word everyone is using \u2014 and rightly so \u2014 to describe the pair of ads featuring a diabolical Uncle Sam who\u2019s trying to convince young adults to opt out of Obamacare.\nBecause of Obamacare, preexisting conditions will no longer prevent some young adults from purchasing a policy.\nUncle Sam magically appears, snaps on a pair of blue rubber gloves and wriggles his fingers in anticipation."}
