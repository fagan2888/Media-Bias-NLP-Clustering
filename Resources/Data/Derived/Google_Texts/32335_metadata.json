There were clear medical advantages to performing a tubal ligation immediately following a Cesarean or vaginal birth, she said.\n\nDirect sterilization of either a man or woman is not permitted by a Catholic health institution.\n\nGill said the Ethical and Religious Directives policy calls sterilization for sterilization's sake \"intrinsically evil.\"\n\nHowever, the directive violates Miller's rights under California law, and constitutes sex discrimination as it's denying her pregnancy- related care, she said.\n\nIn the August 25 statement, the ACLU stated, \"While we're grateful Mercy Medical has agreed to provide medical care in this instance for Ms. Miller, the reality remains that there is a clear conflict between the best interests of patients and the directives of the Catholic hospital system.\"\n\nThere is no other hospital within a 70-mile radius that has birthing facilities that are not Catholic-affiliated, Gill said. Miller's insurance company had offered to cover her delivery at the UC Davis Medical Center in Sacramento, which is more than 160 miles away.\n\n\"I hope my case will shine a light on this issue so that others aren't turned away,\" said Miller.\n\nMercy Medical, which runs as a Catholic hospital, is part of the Dignity Health hospital system which was founded by the Sisters of Mercy and operated as a Catholic health system until 2012, when it changed its governance.\n\nThe hospital receives both state and federal funding.\n\nA growing number of Catholic hospitals are banning sterilization procedures, according to ProPublica in a piece published earlier this year. The shift has worried many ob-gyns.\n\nContraceptive sterilization is considered the nation's second most common form of birth control.\n\nTwitter: @SusanMorseHFN", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/mercy-medical-center-facing-lawsuit-will-allow-sterilization-california-woman", "image": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/Mercy-Hospital-Redding%2C-CA-Google-feature.jpg", "site_name": "Healthcare Finance News", "description": "Under the threat of a potential lawsuit, the Catholic-affiliated Mercy Medical Center in Redding, California, on Thursday backed down from its decision to deny a woman's request for a postpartum tubal ligation, a sterilization procedure.", "title": "Mercy Medical Center, facing lawsuit, will allow sterilization of California woman"}, "twitter": {"site": "@HC_Finance", "image": {"src": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/Mercy-Hospital-Redding%2C-CA-Google-feature.jpg"}, "description": "Under the threat of a potential lawsuit, the Catholic-affiliated Mercy Medical Center in Redding, California, on Thursday backed down from its decision to deny a woman's request for a postpartum tubal ligation, a sterilization procedure.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Mercy Medical Center, facing lawsuit, will allow sterilization of California woman"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "Under the threat of a potential lawsuit, the Catholic-affiliated Mercy Medical Center in Redding, California, on Thursday backed down from its decision to deny a woman's request for a postpartum tubal ligation, a sterilization procedure.&#13; The American Civil Liberties Union released a statement Thursday saying Mercy Medical Center had approved the request for patient Rachel Miller, who wanted the procedure done during her scheduled cesarean section in September.&#13; While Mercy said it would not discuss specific patient details, it did release a statement about its policy.", "viewport": "width=device-width; initial-scale=1.0; maximum-scale=1.0; user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "The ACLU is representing Miller, who is scheduled to give birth via C-section at Mercy Medical Center on Sept. 29.\nImage of Mercy Medical Center from Google.\nThe American Civil Liberties Union released a statement Thursday saying Mercy Medical Center had approved the request for patient Rachel Miller, who wanted the procedure done during her scheduled cesarean section in September.\nUnder the threat of a potential lawsuit, the Catholic-affiliated Mercy Medical Center in Redding, California, on Thursday backed down from its decision to deny a woman's request for a postpartum tubal ligation, a sterilization procedure.\nMercy Medical, which runs as a Catholic hospital, is part of the Dignity Health hospital system which was founded by the Sisters of Mercy and operated as a Catholic health system until 2012, when it changed its governance."}
