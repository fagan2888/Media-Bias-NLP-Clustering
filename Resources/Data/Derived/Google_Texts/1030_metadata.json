Remember also how some people complained that such exemptions in health care plans should be allowed only for churches and religious ministries?\n\nApparently, the state government of California thinks that both of those claims are absurd. They think that every employer \u2014 including churches \u2014 should be required to pay for elective surgical abortions.\n\nIn August, California\u2019s Department of Managed Health Care (DMHC) began sending notices to health insurance companies notifying them that they were required to cover the cost of abortions. The only exception allowed was that a health plan is not required to pay for abortions of a \u201cviable fetus,\u201d i.e., if there is a \u201creasonable likelihood of the fetus\u2019 sustained survival outside the uterus without the application of extraordinary medical measures.\u201d There were no exemptions for organizations that might have a religious belief that forbids them from even indirectly paying for abortions. Even a pro-life group dedicated to opposing abortion would be required to cover abortions in the healthcare policies provided to their employees.\n\n\n\nThis wasn\u2019t always the case. DMHC had previously given approval to Anthem Blue Cross and Kaiser Permanente to offer plans that excluded abortions deemed not \u201cmedically necessary.\u201d DMHC officials, appointed by Gov. Jerry Brown, have not explained why they overturned the exemption approvals given under the administration of Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger.\n\nThe decision also applies to health care plans purchased by churches. According to World magazine, seven churches (Skyline Church in La Mesa, Foothill Church and Foothill Christian School in Glendora, Alpine Christian Fellowship in El Cajon, The Shepherd of the Hills Church in Porter Ranch, City View Church in San Diego, Faith Baptist Church in Santa Barbara, and Calvary Chapel Chino Hills in Chino) have responded by filing a formal complaint with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.\n\n\u201cUnder federal law, pro-life employers have the freedom to choose health insurance plans that do not conflict with their beliefs on the dignity of human life,\u201d says Catherine Short, legal director for Life Legal Defense Foundation Legal Direct. \u201cAlready under Obamacare\u2019s mandates, employers and individuals are required to purchase health insurance coverage they may not need or want. California cannot be allowed to discriminate against health plans that don\u2019t cover elective abortions and force people to purchase coverage that conflicts with their convictions.\u201d\n\nThe Weldon Amendment, adopted with each Health and Human Services appropriations act since 2005, allows the federal government to withhold funding from any state that doesn\u2019t allow conscience objections in health plans. But though this is the law of the land, it has to be enforced by the same executive branch agency and presidential administration that has fought so hard to deny religious liberties in other situations. Will this time be different? Will the Obama administration obey the law and decide it\u2019s finally time protect the religious liberty of American\u2019s pro-life citizens?", "article_metadata": {"description": "Remember the Hobby Lobby case when the Supreme Court ruled that an employer could not be required to provide employees with certain types of abortifacients", "generator": "WordPress 4.3.1", "og": {"site_name": "Acton Institute PowerBlog", "description": "Remember the Hobby Lobby case when the Supreme Court ruled that an employer could not be required to provide employees with certain types of abortifacients", "title": "In California, Abortion Rights Trump Religious Freedom of Churches | Acton PowerBlog", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://blog.acton.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/abortion-is-not-healthcare-300x231.jpg", "url": "http://blog.acton.org/archives/73541-california-abortion-rights-trump-religious-freedom-churches.html", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Acton Institute PowerBlog", "description": "Remember the Hobby Lobby case when the Supreme Court ruled that an employer could not be required to provide employees with certain types of abortifacients", "creator": "@joecarter", "image": "http://blog.acton.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/abortion-is-not-healthcare-300x231.jpg", "title": "In California, Abortion Rights Trump Religious Freedom of Churches | Acton PowerBlog", "site": "@actoninstitute", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"admins": 22411840}, "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/actoninstitute", "section": "Religious Liberty", "published_time": "2014-10-23T16:26:01+00:00", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/joe.p.carter"}, "viewport": "width=device-width; initial-scale=1.0; maximum-scale=1.0; minimum-scale=1.0; user-scalable=0;"}, "article_summary": "Remember also how some people complained that such exemptions in health care plans should be allowed only for churches and religious ministries?\nWill the Obama administration obey the law and decide it\u2019s finally time protect the religious liberty of American\u2019s pro-life citizens?\nThey think that every employer \u2014 including churches \u2014 should be required to pay for elective surgical abortions.\nEven a pro-life group dedicated to opposing abortion would be required to cover abortions in the healthcare policies provided to their employees.\nThe decision also applies to health care plans purchased by churches."}
