As much as a half-inch of snow is expected to fall in the Denver metro area Friday, making it a white Christmas if the weather follows predictions.

“Yeah we’re going to see some flakes, but I don’t think a lot of snow will fall,” said Nezette Rydell, meteorologist for the National Weather Service in Boulder.

Although technically there is a 40 percent chance of snow falling on Christmas, it’s likely snow will fall across the Front Range, with heavier amounts of snow falling in the northern part of the state.

Snow won’t begin to fall until Christmas afternoon or evening, Rydell said.

Christmas also brings a full moon, the first such occurrence since 1977, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration reports.

The “full moon, the last of the year, is called the Full Cold Moon because it occurs during the beginning of winter,” the space agency says. The moon’s peak will occur at 8:11 a.m. Denver time.

There won’t be another Christmas full moon until 2034.

By Saturday morning another 1 to 2 inches of snow is expected to fall in the metro area.

The onslaught of snow in the mountains will continue through Friday.

Over the last 24 hours, mountain towns received another pounding, with 18 inches falling at Loveland Pass and 27 inches falling in parts of Jackson County, Rydell said.

“It will be a good Christmas present for skiers,” she said.

Temperatures in Denver are expected to hit 31 degrees on Christmas and 19 on Saturday. Low temperatures will drop to 4 degrees by Saturday.
