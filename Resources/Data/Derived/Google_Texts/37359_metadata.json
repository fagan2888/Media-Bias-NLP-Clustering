One of the latest additions to \u201cThe Daily Show w/ Jon Stewart,\u201d Che is a stand-up comedian five years into his career.\n\nHe\u2019s written for \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d and has been hailed by Rolling Stone and Variety as a major new talent. But at his 10:30pm show at the Theatre Sainte-Catherine, Che wasn\u2019t going for the kill. He sauntered onto stage with a beer in hand and spent most of the show feeling out concepts and interacting with the crowd.\n\n\u201cI was really just trying to find new premises, new ideas,\u201d he said the next day. \u201cSometimes I\u2019ll throw ideas out just to see how the crowd reacts. Are they even interested in this subject? Like a chemist, you\u2019re just putting things together and seeing what happens.\u201d\n\nChe\u2019s onstage cadence is like an upright bass solo: Laid back and a little soft, but punctuated with the occasional rattling note to emphasize an idea. On Thursday he pondered what makes a couple truly intimate (Hint: It involves the toilet) and why it was that the people of Middle East haven\u2019t offered to help relieve the current crisis in inner-city Chicago.\n\nIn this video clip, Che explains why tries to find jokes out of unfunny subject matter.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "Watch an interview with comedian Michael Che, who is one of the latest additions to \"The Daily Show.\"", "title": "Stand-Up Comedian Michael Che On Exploring the Un-Funny", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2014/07/27/stand-up-comedian-michael-che-on-exploring-the-un-funny/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-DV910_che_G_20140727113358.jpg"}, "site": "WSJspeakeasy", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Arts", "article.headline": "Stand-Up Comedian Michael Che On Exploring the Un-Funny", "description": "Watch an interview with comedian Michael Che, who is one of the latest additions to \"The Daily Show.\"", "article_section": "Arts", "author": "Marshall Crook", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "Speakeasy Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "Speakeasy", "article.summary": "Watch an interview with comedian Michael Che, who is one of the latest additions to \"The Daily Show.\"", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2014-07-27T15:36:19-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-210", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2014/07/27/stand-up-comedian-michael-che-on-exploring-the-un-funny/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-SEB-82514", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Arts", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "Watch an interview with comedian Michael Che, who is one of the latest additions to \"The Daily Show.\"", "title": "Stand-Up Comedian Michael Che On Exploring the Un-Funny", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2014/07/27/stand-up-comedian-michael-che-on-exploring-the-un-funny/", "image": {"width": 553, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-DV910_che_G_20140727113358.jpg", "height": 369}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Speakeasy", "article.id": "BL-SEB-82514", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2014-07-28T20:59:17-04:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda59d\"", "article_summary": "Michael Che Getty ImagesOn Thursday night at Montreal\u2019s \u201cJust for Laughs\u201d festival, Michael Che was in the mood to try new things.\nBut at his 10:30pm show at the Theatre Sainte-Catherine, Che wasn\u2019t going for the kill.\nOne of the latest additions to \u201cThe Daily Show w/ Jon Stewart,\u201d Che is a stand-up comedian five years into his career.\nIn this video clip, Che explains why tries to find jokes out of unfunny subject matter.\nHe\u2019s written for \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d and has been hailed by Rolling Stone and Variety as a major new talent."}
