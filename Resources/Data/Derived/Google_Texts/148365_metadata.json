It has also contracted with mobile health provider Teledoc, which will allow members to access a doctor any time for free over a phone or computer.\n\n\n\nThe telemedicine consults may be especially appealing to a younger, more tech-savvy demographic than overall enrollment on New York's health exchange. Since launching in October, Oscar executives say their enrollment has skewed to those who are under age 55.\n\n\"Because we utilize technology and data we have ... signals of what's coming in, and we feel that the risk that we have is manageable,\" Nazemi said.\n\n\n\nThe upstart won't give any specific enrollment numbers until after open enrollment closes March 31, except to say that it's in the thousands. In their regulatory filings, they had anticipated signing up 7,500 customers this first year, and right now they appear to be on track to exceed that.\n\n\u2014By CNBC's Bertha Coombs.
