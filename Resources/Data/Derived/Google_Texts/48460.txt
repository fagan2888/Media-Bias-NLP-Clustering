A community came together Sunday to remember a teenager killed a year ago in an unsolved homicide.

Police seek tips in teenâ€™s unsolved homicide during gun... Greenville police will promote gun safety while encouraging people to come forward with information in the shooting death of 16-year-old Cobey Smith. More

Balloons were released in the Nicholtown community of Greenville in honor of Cobey Smith.

The teen's mother joined organizers of the Put Down The Guns Now Young People Organization near the area where Smith was shot.

Jack Logan, founder of the group, said they will release balloons every day until Jan. 26 in hopes that someone will come forward with information.

"We want this case solved because there are people who are in danger because anyone who would stalk someone, bait someone, then murder someone, that person and those people are dangerous people," said Logan.

Smith was shot to death on Jan. 25, 2015.

The 16 year's old body was found near a trail that runs along the field behind Sterling School.

A $2,000 reward was offered last year after the shooting for information that helps solve the case.

Investigators ask that you call Crimestoppers with any information.
