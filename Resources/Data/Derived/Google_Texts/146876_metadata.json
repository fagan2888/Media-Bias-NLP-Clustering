Since the U.S. Supreme Court is currently hearing the case of whether an employer can be mandated to offer birth control to their employees via employer-paid health plans, the court issued Erickson a temporary injunction.\n\nWith the injunction in place, the statutory and regulatory provisions of the Affordable Care Act will not be enforced upon Erickson until 30 days after the U.S. Supreme Court announces its decision in the case of Sebelius v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc. The Supreme Court is hearing arguments this week in that case. A decision is expected in June.\n\n\n\nofficial MintPress sponsor official MintPress sponsor\n\nAn important and contentious issue\n\nHow the court will ultimately decide is anyone\u2019s guess at the moment, but for many Americans, this is an important issue that pits religious ideals against a woman\u2019s right to have birth control covered under her medical insurance.\n\nJeremy Dys, Senior Counsel for Liberty Institute, a national nonprofit legal group dedicated to defending and restoring religious liberty across the United States, applauded the court\u2019s decision in a press release.\n\n\u201cWe are grateful that the United States Department of Justice agreed to temporarily refrain from enforcing a portion of the law that we believe would force Mr. Erickson to give up his freedom when doing business,\u201d he wrote.\n\nHe also told MintPress News that this injunction offers Mr. Erickson temporary relief.\n\n\u201cThe government should not be able to coerce faith-based, for-profit businesses to violate their religious beliefs,\u201d Dys said. \u201cThis mandate illegally and unconstitutionally forces our client to violate his sincerely held religious beliefs that form the very foundation for his work as a businessman.\u201d\n\nBut not everyone agrees.\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union, along with religious organizations, civil rights and women\u2019s health groups, business leaders and even some members of Congress have filed friend-of-the-court briefs in the Hobby Lobby case, arguing that business owners cannot impose their personal religious beliefs on employees by withholding coverage for health services simply because they disagree that those services are necessary.\n\n\u201cReligious freedom is one of our most fundamental values,\u201d said Louise Melling, deputy director of the ACLU. \u201cIt includes the right to our beliefs, but not the right to impose those views on others or to discriminate. That is exactly what these companies are trying to do. Women shouldn\u2019t be denied the coverage they are entitled to under the law because of what their employer happens to believe.\u201d\n\nDys said, \u201cAmericans don\u2019t give up their freedom when opening up a business,\u201d including their religious freedoms, so they should not have to choose between their faith and an \u201cunlawful\u201d mandate, which is why Erickson pursued this case.\n\n\u2018Steward of Christ\u2019\n\nDouglas Erickson grew up attending Lutheran churches, but became a born-again Christian in the mid-1990s. According to court documents, Erickson\u2019s wife was involved in a worldwide interdenominational Bible study organization, which prompted Erickson to study the Bible more closely, as well. He even joined a men\u2019s Bible study group.\n\nWhen Erickson\u2019s businesses began to struggle financially, he considered selling them. Instead, he opted to \u201csurrender the Dealerships to Christ\u201d and dedicate himself to integrating faith and work at his dealerships. Erickson now says the dealerships are owned by God and that he is a steward who has been chosen to operate them.\n\nErickson employs an ordained pastor associated with the Evangelical Free Church of America to provide pastoral services to employees. He is known as \u201cPastor of the Stores,\u201d and has led monthly prayer gatherings on the first Friday of every month at the dealerships. Employee participation is not mandated, but Erickson reports that most employees choose to participate.\n\nErickson also hosts fundraising events at the dealerships for religious ministries such as Young Life, a nondenominational Christian ministry that reaches out to adolescents. Erickson reportedly donates both his personal and corporate profits from the business to charities. According to court documents, the dealerships have \u201cinvested more than $10,000 of their profits in Young Life\u201d over the past four to five years.\n\nErickson has also supported Total Life Care Centers, a nonprofit, anti-abortion organization that works with women who have experienced an unplanned pregnancy and encourages them to not have an abortion. He has supported this particular charity for the past six to seven years and has donated to the organization with both personal and corporate funds.\n\nBecause the Christian faith teaches followers that life begins at conception, Erickson believes it is \u201ca grave moral wrong to destroy a human embryo\u201d and that contraception \u2014 especially those that may have an \u201cabortifacient effect\u201d \u2014 is immoral and sinful. In consideration of his beliefs, he does not agree that he should have to cover the cost of birth control for his employees.\n\nSince 1989, Erickson has always excluded abortion coverage from his employees\u2019 health insurance plans. But under the Affordable Care Act, Erickson\u2019s health insurance plans would include coverage for birth control such as emergency contraceptives Plan B and Ella and certain intrauterine devices. Erickson says these are not contraceptives that prevent conception, but instead \u201cinduce a chemical abortion of a human life.\u201d\n\nSince the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has issued more than 1,000 individual waivers to employers and insurance plans, excusing them from complying with the birth control mandate, Erickson and his legal team argue that a religious exemption should also be allowed.\n\nWithout an exemption, Erickson would be forced to pay a fine of $100 per day he was found to be incompliant, per employee. Though the maximum fine is $2,000 per employee, Dys said those fines would add up quickly for Erickson, who currently employs more than 60 people.\n\nFaith-based beliefs vs. health care\n\nThough Dys said Erickson\u2019s employees have been extremely supportive of their boss\u2019 attempt to obtain a legal exemption to the birth control mandate, many scholars and human rights advocates have expressed concern about such an exemption.\n\nThey argue that the birth control coverage was built into health insurance plans, meaning that Erickson would not be directly paying for contraception.\n\nOpponents to the religious exemption also say it raises the question of how influential employers should be when it comes to health care coverage for their employees.\n\nIn a political cartoon published in January by Politico, political cartoonist Matt Wuerker created a piece that hypothesized what may happen if an employer\u2019s religion was used to determine what kind of health insurance their employees received.\n\nOne of the character\u2019s in Wuerker\u2019s cartoon said that because her boss was a celibate Shaker, no sex-related health issues would be covered. Another said that since his employer was a vegan Jainist, nothing related to eating meat was covered. The last character said that under her employer\u2019s plan, doctors were not covered at all because her boss is a Christian Scientist.\n\nMintPress asked Dys if he was concerned that a religious exemption could lead to a slippery slope similar to what Wuerker warned of in his cartoon, but Dys said that\u2019s not the issue at stake in this case. He stressed that mandating coverage of life-ending drugs is morally wrong.\n\n\u201cEvery American and business owner should be able to live and work without fear of punishment,\u201d Dys said, explaining that no one should have to choose between obedience to government and obedience to God.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Christian owner of two car dealerships in Minnesota has been granted a temporary exemption against the Affordable Care Act\u2019s birth control mandate.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "AUTHOR": "Katie Rucke", "og": {"site_name": "MintPress News", "description": "The Christian owner of two car dealerships in Minnesota has been granted a temporary exemption against the Affordable Care Act\u2019s birth control mandate.", "title": "Injunction Puts Brakes On Birth Control Mandate", "url": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/injunction-puts-brakes-on-birth-control-mandate/187547/", "image": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Vatican-US-Contracept_Webf-690x539.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-03-26T14:50:32-05:00", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The Christian owner of two car dealerships in Minnesota has been granted a temporary exemption against the Affordable Care Act\u2019s birth control mandate.", "title": "Injunction Puts Brakes On Birth Control Mandate", "image": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Vatican-US-Contracept_Webf.jpg", "creator": "@katierucke", "site": "@MintPressNews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"admins": 100003161352196}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/MintpressNewsMPN", "section": "Front Page: National", "tag": "religious exemption", "published_time": "2014-03-25T22:40:55-05:00", "modified_time": "2014-03-26T14:50:32-05:00"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde6d3\"", "article_summary": "Injunction Puts Brakes On Birth Control MandateThe Christian owner of two car dealerships in Minnesota has been granted a temporary exemption against the Affordable Care Act\u2019s birth control mandate.\nThey argue that the birth control coverage was built into health insurance plans, meaning that Erickson would not be directly paying for contraception.\nIn consideration of his beliefs, he does not agree that he should have to cover the cost of birth control for his employees.\nDouglas Erickson, the owner of two car dealerships in Hastings, Minn., asked a Minnesota district court to not enforce the controversial birth control mandate against him and his company.\nBut under the Affordable Care Act, Erickson\u2019s health insurance plans would include coverage for birth control such as emergency contraceptives Plan B and Ella and certain intrauterine devices."}
