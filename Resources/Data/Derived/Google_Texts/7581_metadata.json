Trump and Senator Ted Cruz in Iowa polls; and Hillary Clinton for the Democrats, who is in a tight race with Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont.\n\nAnd in a move that was less than an endorsement but perhaps even more significant, Iowa\u2019s senior elected Republican, Senator Charles E. Grassley, shared a stage with Donald J. Trump here in Pella, standing behind a \u201cTrump\u201d sign on a podium. The appearance conferred a seal of approval by elements of the Republican establishment that once declined to take Mr. Trump seriously and is now beginning to see him as preferable to Mr. Cruz, a hard-line conservative.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m happy to be here with such an enthusiastic group and this candidate,\u201d Mr. Grassley said. Mr. Trump reciprocated later, saying, \u201cThis is a great guy, this is a great guy,\u201d as photographers snapped pictures of the unlikely pairing. \u201cHe\u2019s respected by everybody.\u201d\n\nAt an rally earlier Saturday, Mr. Trump joked that he was so impervious to attacks, including charges by rivals that he was not a true conservative, that he could shoot people in the middle of Fifth Avenue without losing support.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHis remark came in for angry rebuke from Glenn Beck, the right-wing radio host, who campaigned in Iowa with Mr. Cruz on Saturday. \u201cThis kind of hubris,\u201d Mr. Beck said gravely, referring to Mr. Trump, \u201cis beyond imagination.\u201d\n\nThroughout the gathering, Mr. Cruz and Mr. Beck alluded to the left-leaning positions taken by Mr. Trump for much of his life.\n\n\u201cNobody on earth ever grew a backbone after they got into 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue,\u201d Mr. Cruz said. \u201cIs there any chance on earth that individual would actually stand up to the cronyism and cartel in Washington?\u201d\n\nFor his part, Mr. Trump raised doubts about Mr. Cruz\u2019s eligibility to serve because of his Canadian birth and about an unreported loan he took from Goldman Sachs to finance a Senate race.\n\n\u201cYou got to pick a winner, because I\u2019m the only one who\u2019s going to win,\u201d he told Iowans, referring to the general election.\n\nIn endorsing Mr. Rubio, The Register sought an alternative to the two leading Republicans in the race, who each engender hostility from large parts of their party. \u201cRepublicans have the opportunity to define their party\u2019s future in this election,\u201d the paper wrote. \u201cThey could choose anger, pessimism and fear. Or they could take a different path,\u201d the editors wrote.\n\nIt called Mr. Rubio his \u201cparty\u2019s best hope\u201d for enlarging the Republican tent and called him \u201cwhip-smart\u201d about policy matters in meetings with editors.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe paper\u2019s once highly anticipated backing is less meaningful in an age of reduced print circulation and the hogging of the news cycle by a candidate, Mr. Trump, whose often insulting tweets are followed by nearly 6 million people and whose rallies are covered live on cable TV.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nFor Mr. Rubio, however, it may offer a bounce if establishment-leaning Republicans who dislike Mr. Trump and Mr. Cruz, and so far have been divided among several candidates, start to coalesce behind the Florida senator.\n\nSpeaking to about 250 people in Indianola, Iowa, about an hour after The Register announced its endorsement, Mr. Rubio did not revel in it. Only after a questioner congratulated him for it did he say, jokingly, \u201cI\u2019d rather have your endorsement.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m grateful for it,\u201d he added, \u201cbut I still want you to caucus for me.\u201d\u2019\n\nHe seemed to have taken some of the newspaper editorial\u2019s advice to heart as he gave one of his more upbeat campaign speeches recently. Though it spoke glowingly of him, The Register\u2019s article also chided the senator, known for his optimistic message of American exceptionalism and renewal, for offering a darker assessment about the country\u2019s prospects lately. \u201cHe has pandered to rising pessimism in his party. He talks gloomily about \u2018a nation in decline,\u2019 \u201d the editorial said.\n\nOn Saturday evening he was lighter on the gloom. America, he said, \u201cis the greatest country in the history of the world.\u201d He added: \u201cWe don\u2019t say that enough.\u201d\n\nMrs. Clinton was the paper\u2019s pick ahead of the 2008 caucuses as well, when she finished a disappointing third behind Barack Obama and John Edwards.\n\nThe paper wrote Mrs. Clinton \u201cis not a perfect candidate,\u201d but it noted, \u201cThe presidency is not an entry-level position.\u201d\n\nAlthough it praised Mrs. Clinton\u2019s chief rival, Senator Bernie Sanders, for injecting the issue of income inequality into the races in both parties the paper hesitated over the near-impossibility Mr. Sanders would face in getting his sweeping programs through Congress.\n\nMrs. Clinton has been making the same argument, particularly about Mr. Sanders\u2019s proposal for universal health care; she says a wiser course is to improve on President Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act. Recognizing the power of Mr. Sanders\u2019s idea, though, she has taken to reminding people of her own attempts to create universal health care during her husband\u2019s administration.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cNow, before it was called Obamacare, it was called Hillarycare, as some of you might remember,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said at a town-hall-style event in Clinton, Iowa, on Saturday, the second time in recent days she has used the line.\n\n\u201cWe share the same goal: universal health care for every single American,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said of her rival. \u201cBut we have a real difference about how to get there.\u201d\n\nMr. Sanders, who began a weekend bus tour of eastern Iowa cities and towns on Saturday, began the day speaking to more than 150 supporters who hollered and stomped their feet in his Davenport campaign office, before heading out to canvass.\n\nMr. Sanders, who has begun to resemble Mr. Trump in his penchant for citing positive polls, maintained that in head-to-head matchups with Mr. Trump he outshined Mrs. Clinton.\n\nPointing out that former President Bill Clinton has stepped up attacking him, calling him angry, Mr. Sanders embraced the distinction. \u201cAnd, you know what?\u201d he said. \u201cIt is true. I am angry and the American people are angry.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20160123205034, "twitter": {"description": "The Des Moines Register backed Senator Marco Rubio of Florida for the Republicans; and Hillary Clinton for the Democrats.
