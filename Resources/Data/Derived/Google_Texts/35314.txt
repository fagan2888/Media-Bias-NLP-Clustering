This week's edition of Bracketology deals with travel.

Not necessarily travel as in the road to a championship, but travel as in “WHY IS MY GREAT BIG WONDERFUL UNDEFEATED TEAM ON THE ROAD THIS WEEK?!?!”

First, stop yelling. It’s Sunday. Be nice. I can't hear the TV if you yell.

Second, it has everything to do with being nice and playing fair. For the AISA, it’s easy – everyone’s on the road in Troy for the state championships. That includes Edgewood Academy, which has won something like a hundred-eleventy straight games.

For the AHSAA pairings, it’s a little more complex. For this round, the team that traveled the most in the first two rounds gets to be home for the third round – even if they were the fourth seed. Think of it as Southern socialism or 100-yard Obamacare.

Ahhh, but there are exceptions; pre-existing conditions if you will. If both teams have traveled an equal amount – both at home, on road or one of each – then the team on the bottom of the bracket pairing gets the home game. And if both teams are from the same region, the higher seed gets the concession stand money even if the other team has spent more time on the bus than Ralph Kramden (kids, ask your grandparents).

So that’s why your perfect team is on the road this week – or hosting, which ever you prefer. You can check out next Friday’s games below if you like. Or feel free to click on our interactive, printable brackets as you look behind or ahead to next week – or the week after.
