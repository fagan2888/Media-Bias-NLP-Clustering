She will square off with David Alameel, a multimillionaire dentist, in a May 27 primary.\n\nThe two are competing for the nomination to replace Sen. John Cornyn, the Republican incumbent won his own primary Tuesday easily.\n\nSince Rogers isn\u2019t a Republican, tea party \u201cextremist,\u201d the liberal media have avoided giving her much of a platform since her failed campaign for Congress in 2012, but she\u2019s no shrinking violet.\n\nAccording to The Hill, besides wanting to impeach the president and repeal Obamacare, Rogers advocates \u201c \u2018crushing Wall Street\u2019 \u2026. In the past, she\u2019s drawn Hitler mustaches on Obama posters and likened ObamaCare to practices of Nazi doctors.\u201d\n\nAnd she forced a phenomenally wealthy candidate backed by the Texas Democrat establishment into a runoff with a campaign that received only $27,000 in donations.\n\nTexas Democrats should be quaking.\n\nIf Rogers were a conservative fringer who\u2019d managed to force an establishment Republican candidate into a primary runoff for a U.S. Senate seat, she would have been on all the morning talk shows today. On NBC, Rachel Maddow would be snarling; Chris Mattews would be weeping.\n\nInstead, she\u2019s a Democrat, and the media attention is minimal. And come May 28, she could be the Democratic candidate for Senate running on a platform of impeachment and Obamacare repeal.\n\nNow that she\u2019s forced a runoff against a wealthy, well-endorsed businessman, it\u2019s going to be tough for the mainstreamers at the New York Times and the non-Fox networks to keep ignoring her.\n\nThis should be fun.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.4.3", "og": {"site_name": "BizPac Review", "description": "A Texas Democrat who hates Obamacare and wants to impeach the president is one of the party\u2019s top candidates for Senate after a primary Tuesday cut a crowded field down to two.
