His campaign told Bartels that 50 percent of his ads have focused on women\u2019s issues and Gardner\u2019s co-sponsorship of federal personhood legislation. (Like Iowa GOP Senate nominee Joni Ernst, who has also supported a personhood\u00a0initiative, Gardner describes the bill he backs as merely a statement that he supports life.)\n\nDemocratic consultant Steve Welchert, who worked for Udall on previous congressional campaigns, explains that Gardner\u2019s \u201chappy-warrior mentality\u201d has made it harder for voters to believe Democratic attacks. That goes even for card-carrying members of the \u201cso-called liberal media,\u201d according to Bartels. \u201cThe press knows him,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen you hear Cory Gardner is this right-wing lunatic, you\u2019re like, that\u2019s not the Cory I know.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Udall\u2019s focus on women\u2019s issues has undermined his past strengths \u2014 his moderate personality and zest for retail politics. \u201cHis obnoxious one-issue campaign is an insult to those he seeks to convince,\u201d\u00a0the Denver Post\u2019s editors wrote while endorsing Gardner.\u00a0Welchert says that the attack ads have saddled the embattled Democrat with \u201ca little harsher\u201d public image than he usually enjoys. Verbal flubs, such as his unaccountable difficulty naming books that have influenced him (Udall has a reputation as an avid reader), have made the contrast with smooth-talking Gardner even more pronounced.\n\nUdall could still pull out a win, given the get-out-the-vote operation Democrats have built over the years, but Gardner has done just about everything he can to succeed.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s arguably the best candidate with the best campaign team in the country,\u201d says a Washington-based GOP strategist. \u201cShould Democrats pull a rabbit out of a hat in Colorado, the [GOP] will have a lot of soul-searching to do in this state.\u201d\n\nAs of now, though, it looks like the sunny Gardner will have more reason to be all smiles on election night.\n\n\u2014 Joel Gehrke is a political reporter for\u00a0National Review Online.", "card": "summary", "title": "Cory Gardner Is Pitching a Perfect Game, by Joel Gehrke, National Review"}, "tweettext": "Cory Gardner Is Pitching a Perfect Game", "msvalidate.01": "E48498F585100158A880ED1615918208", "robots": "follow, index", "sailthru.title": "Cory Gardner Is Pitching a Perfect Game", "keywords": "Joel Gehrke", "fb": {"app_id": 129250807108374}, "sailthru.tags": "Cory Gardner Is Pitching a Perfect Game, Joel Gehrke, National Review", "google-site-verification": "OOtPjyj3i8ggfSXzZ7MPoTiwFy_JnfzKMPkjZ5bhpk0", "copyright": "\u00a9 National Review, Inc.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Joel Gehrke, Politics, Nation, World"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2714\"", "article_summary": "\u2014 Joel Gehrke is a political reporter for National Review Online.\nThat led to the paper\u2019s reporting that plan-cancellation notices were going out, pursuant to Obamacare, weeks before the national press focused on the issue.\n\u201cThere just comes this pounding on the window, and [the reporter] said he practically jumped out of his skin, and he looked and it was Cory Gardner, and Cory was just laughing that he had gotten him,\u201d the Denver Post\u2019s Lynn Bartels, recounting a years-old story about Gardner\u2019s prank on another reporter, tells National Review Online.\n\u201cHe was as good a state legislator as I ever worked with,\u201d former state representative Rob Witwer says.\n\u201cWhen you hear Cory Gardner is this right-wing lunatic, you\u2019re like, that\u2019s not the Cory I know.\u201dMeanwhile, Udall\u2019s focus on women\u2019s issues has undermined his past strengths \u2014 his moderate personality and zest for retail politics."}
