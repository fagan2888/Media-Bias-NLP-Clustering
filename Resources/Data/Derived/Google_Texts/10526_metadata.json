Maybe the IUD is right for you.\"\n\nThe \"Maybe the IUD\" campaign is meant to reach women 18 to 30 years old. They may have spent the night at a date's place or had a fun night out with friends and missed taking a birth control pill. Oral contraceptives, which have a failure rate of 9%, are most effective when taken every day at the same time.\n\nLess than 1% of women using a hormonal or copper version of the IUD, however, get pregnant.\n\n\"The best method is the one a woman chooses and is best for her,\" says Dr. Deborah L. Kaplan, assistant commissioner of the health department's Bureau of Maternal, Infant and Reproductive Health. \"But she needs accurate information.\"\n\nImage: NYC Dept. of Health\n\nWhen left in place, the IUD can prevent pregnancy for as long as 10 years. It can easily be removed by a doctor and requires little maintenance. Side effects include cramping and irregular periods or spotting. The IUD does not prevent sexually transmitted infections.\n\nFor years, women and their physicians were skeptical of the IUD, following the introduction and recall of a poorly designed IUD called the Dalkon Shield in the 1970s; thousands of women who used the device complained of infections and miscarriages. The IUD was also linked to more than a dozen deaths.\n\nThe kind of IUDs used now are widely considered safe, but at several hundred dollars, they are expensive. The Affordable Care Act, however, requires insurance companies to cover the cost of at least one form of the 18 FDA-approved birth control methods, including the IUD.\n\nEvery person is different. #MaybeTheIUD is right for you. Maybe not. But maybe you should ask a doctor! #MaybetheIUDchat \u2014 mary alice carter (@MACarter73) October 6, 2015\n\nKaplan says it's essential for all New Yorkers to get access to every birth control option available.\n\nIn 2013, according to the city's data, almost 40% of women between the ages of 18 and 45 who had vaginal sex in the previous year did not use birth control, despite the fact that they didn't plan on becoming pregnant. Reaching low-income women is particularly important as they far more likely to report unintended pregnancies.\n\nThe city's IUD campaign is part of a five-year public awareness initiative to increase access to and use of contraceptives in addition to a range of sexual and reproductive health services. Its honest approach about sex is a radical departure from controversial debates about birth control, including lawsuits over the Obamacare contraception mandate and Congressional hearings to defund Planned Parenthood.\n\nKaplan says the city wants to lead on this issue: \"We strongly support a woman\u2019s right to comprehensive reproductive and sex health services.\"\n\n#MaybetheIUD is the right choice for you! via @nycHealthy #LoveMyLARC #kycsf pic.twitter.com/FyDalMYCAs \u2014 Know Your Choices SF (@kycsf) October 5, 2015\n\n\"Normalizing\" the conversation, Kaplan adds, means involving both women and men, making it playful, and also acknowledging that some women of color and low-income women may be wary of certain types of birth control given a history of forced sterilization in the U.S.\n\nThat's why the health department partnered with reproductive justice advocates to ensure its outreach is sensitive to those experiences and reflects the needs of a diverse city that includes not only communities of color, but also people with different sexualities and gender identities.\n\n\"Our overall goal,\" says Kaplan, \"is to ensure all New Yorkers have the information and services they need to take control of their sexual and reproductive health.\"\n\nHave something to add to this story?
