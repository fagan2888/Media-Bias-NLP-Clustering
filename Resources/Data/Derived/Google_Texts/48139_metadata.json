For instance, a narrow majority of respondents said that they would forgo treatment out of concern for the expense, and 29 percent said that cost is the single biggest factor they weigh when determining which plan to purchase.\n\n\"Cost trumps health when it comes to making healthcare decisions for consumers,\" Stephens says. \"It's remarkable to what extent consumers will avoid treatments if it will save them money.\"\n\nHealthline's survey comes just ahead of the next open enrollment period for ACA-compliant plans to begin later this week, but with consumers reporting generally low opinions about Obamacare and the healthcare system broadly, Stephens says that businesses in that sector need to get more aggressive about pushing out information tailored to consumers to help them navigate the healthcare exchanges and better understand the value proposition that insurance plans offer.\n\n\"What this survey demonstrates from the chief information officer's perspective is I've got to get much more creative about how I get information out into the marketplace,\" he says.\n\nThat applies to all players in the healthcare ecosystem, including plans, providers and health tech firms like Healthline, Stephens argues.\n\n\"We're all in this together,\" he adds. \"We're responsible for getting information out in to the market. Not only in a general way to reach the average person, but in a very granular way.\"\n\nStephens worries that even with the mandate to purchase health insurance that is a cornerstone of the ACA, too many Americans will remain passive consumers in the marketplace, either opting for the lowest-cost plan without considering their coverage needs, or opting to pay the penalty and go without insurance altogether.\n\nIn his call for healthcare firms to engage with consumers, Stephens draws a parallel to the trend toward personalized medicine, where providers tailor customized treatment plans based on the unique characteristics of their patients.\n\n\"The same thing applies for health information itself,\" Stephens says. \"I think it's an investment in information and understanding how to match that information to your customers and realizing that there isn't an average -- they're all individuals.\"\n\nCall to CIOs to Use Social Media to Promote Health Info\n\nStephens is appealing to CIOs and other business divisions at firms across the healthcare ecosystem to engage in social media outlets like Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, as well as other online venues like patient forums or hospital websites to expand their consumer engagement and deliver information about health coverage that might help improve Americans' perception of the system that accounts for nearly 18 percent of U.S. GDP.\n\nAs it is, more than 80 percent of respondents in Healthline's poll said that they would give the U.S. health care system a \"C\" or worse, and just 32 percent said that they believe Obamacare is having a positive effect on the care that is provided. With stronger, more targeted outreach from the industry, Stephens believes those numbers could shift.\n\n\"We access information in a lot of different ways, and that access is actually widening, not narrowing,\" Stephens says. \"[Chief] information officers need to think about all the various channels they need to be communicating to the public at large and also their consumers.\"\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"rating": "General", "twitter": {"url": "http://www.cio.com/article/2846005/healthcare/cios-must-be-healthcare-leaders-to-battle-consumer-confusion.html", "image": "http://images.techhive.com/images/article/2014/11/healthcare_cio-100528413-primary.idge.jpg", "site": "@CIOonline", "card": "summary", "description": "A new survey finds that healthcare consumers are worried and confused about Obamacare.
