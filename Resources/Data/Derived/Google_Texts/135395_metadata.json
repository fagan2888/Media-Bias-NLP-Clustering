Catania, political analysts say.\n\n\u201cMoney is a good measure of a certain type of competitiveness,\u201d said Paul S. Herrnson, executive director for the Roper Center for Public Opinion Research at the University of Connecticut and a longtime D.C. political observer. \u201cCandidates have to run for two kinds of campaigns: one for votes and another for resources.\u201d\n\nIn the District, where 75 percent of voters are registered Democrats, primary elections routinely decide the mayor\u2019s race. The closest general election for mayor in the city\u2019s history was separated by 14 points, when Republican Carol Schwartz in 1994 was defeated by Marion Barry, who sought a third term in office after being jailed for smoking crack cocaine.\n\nBut with the entrance into the race by Mr. Catania, a seasoned politician who has served 17 years on the D.C. Council, the general election is expected to be more than a pro forma exercise.\n\nThe extension of the election cycle, though, stands to wear out donors. Both sides will ask for contributions after a Democratic primary in which roughly $5 million was raised and spent by the well-connected likes of Mayor Vincent C. Gray and four D.C. Council members.\n\n\u201cEveryone has been called a million times and been asked to give, and there is a certain fatigue,\u201d said Chuck Thies, who managed Mr. Gray\u2019s campaign. \u201cIf you are a regular donor, you got called by everyone.\u201d\n\nThe contribution limit to any candidate for the D.C. mayoral race is $2,000 per donor, and the entire race \u2014 from the primary through the general election \u2014 is counted as one cycle.\n\n\u201cIt does not reset,\u201d said Wesley Williams, spokesman of the D.C. Office of Campaign Finance. \u201cIf you contribute the maximum leading up to the primary, you are done. You don\u2019t have a clean slate.\u201d\n\nThe limit most affects Ms. Bowser, who had to raise significant money to stay ahead during the primary race. During that stretch of the election, Ms. Bowser collected 339 individual donations of $2,000 for a total of $678,000 \u2014 close to half of the more than $1.3 million she raised throughout the primary race.\n\nMany top-tier donors find other ways to stay involved in the campaign after reaching the limit, Bowser campaign manager Bo Shuff said.\n\n\u201cOne of the nice things about people who have maxed out already is that you don\u2019t have to encourage them to do much more. They do it on their own,\u201d he said. \u201cOne of my maxed-out donation guys drove a van on Election Day.\u201d\n\nTo rally supporters, Ms. Bowser\u2019s campaign has organized a series of \u201cunity\u201d events meant to bring together Democrats who just a few months back were warring against her.\n\nFormer rivals Jack Evans, Tommy Wells and Vincent B. Orange joined Ms. Bowser at one such event last weekend. Ms. Bowser touted the motto \u201cIf Democrats vote, Democrats win.\u201d\n\nDonors to other candidates in the primary would be prime resources for Ms. Bowser, if she can persuade them. Mr. Catania also has made a play for disaffected Democrats by rolling out campaign signs featuring the slogan \u201cDemocrats for David.\u201d\n\nBut Ms. Bowser\u2019s decisive 12 percentage point win over Mr. Gray in the primary could turn a lot of heads.\n\n\u201cIn D.C., everybody wants to kiss the ring,\u201d said D.C. Watch founder and political watchdog Dorothy Brizill. \u201cSo I assume a lot of people who give Mr. Evans and Mr. Gray money will want to kiss the ring and give Ms. Bowser money.\u201d\n\nThat support could prove crucial.\n\nMr. Catania, an openly gay former Republican who championed the city\u2019s same-sex marriage bill, has appealed to the gay community at the national level and is expected to see a bump in his campaign coffers as a result. It remains to be seen whether Ms. Bowser, who was largely unknown prior to her mayoral bid, can capitalize on her status as the Democratic nominee to raise significant money from outside the city.\n\nIn addition, the D.C. mayor\u2019s race takes place in a year in which campaigns nationwide will be competing for cash. Midterm elections will put every seat in the House of Representatives up for grabs, while Maryland chooses a governor and Virginia elects a U.S. senator.\n\nWhile not getting into specific dollar figures, Ms. Bowser\u2019s camp feels good about its showing.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re happy with our pace. A lot of people are coming out in support of the council member,\u201d Mr. Shuff said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have resources to pull off a competitive campaign.\u201d\n\nFor Mr. Catania, the first reporting deadline will serve as a means for voters to evaluate his viability as a candidate, said veteran campaign adviser Doug Patton, who is working with Mr. Catania this round.\n\n\u201cPeople will look at what David has reported and say \u2018Uh-oh, he\u2019s serious\u2019 or \u2018Uh-oh, forget him,\u2019\u201d said Mr. Patton, who worked with Mayor Adrian M. Fenty and Mr. Gray. \u201cIf he\u2019s over $300,000 or $350,000, I think that will be significant. I think that will play a role in how people perceive him.\u201d\n\nCampaign finance records show Mr. Catania transferred $115,000 from his exploratory committee into his campaign committee\u2019s account in April after filing for election. In the past several days, his campaign has sent email blasts to supporters asking for help first to meet a $5,000 goal and after surpassing it in one day upping the goal to $15,000.\n\n\u201cFor him, a strong fundraising showing is much more important,\u201d Mr. Hernnson said.\n\nAlthough it is important, money isn\u2019t everything, Catania campaign manager Ben Young said, pointing to the 2010 election in which a heavily funded Mr. Fenty was trounced by Mr. Gray.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not a substitute for a record that people care about,\u201d Mr. Young said, referring to the Catania campaign\u2019s frequent criticism that Ms. Bowser\u2019s record as a lawmaker is thin. \u201cIt\u2019s not make-or-break, but I expect her to have a significant amount of money. But I think we\u2019ll be where we need to be to win the race.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Contenders in the D.C. mayor's race are scheduled to file financial statements Tuesday providing the best clues yet as to how competitive the election will be &mdash; and whether donors in the heavily Democratic city are tapped out after a bruising and expensive primary campaign.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Contenders in the D.C. mayor\u2019s race are scheduled to file financial statements Tuesday providing the best clues yet as to how competitive the election will be \u2014 and whether donors in the heavily Democratic city are tapped out after a bruising and expensive primary campaign.", "title": "D.C. mayoral race a strain on donors", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/jun/8/dc-mayoral-race-a-strain-on-donors/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/06/08/6_8_2014_bowser-20140402-016-28201.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/06/08/6_8_2014_bowser-20140402-016-28201.jpg", "description": "Contenders in the D.C. mayor's race are scheduled to file financial statements Tuesday providing the best clues yet as to how competitive the election will be &mdash; and whether donors in the heavily", "card": "summary", "title": "D.C. mayoral race a strain on donors"}, "Author": "Andrea Noble", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Politics, Muriel Bowser, David A Catania, Vincent C Gray"}, "article_summary": "Many top-tier donors find other ways to stay involved in the campaign after reaching the limit, Bowser campaign manager Bo Shuff said.\nIn addition, the D.C. mayor\u2019s race takes place in a year in which campaigns nationwide will be competing for cash.\nFormer rivals Jack Evans, Tommy Wells and Vincent B.
