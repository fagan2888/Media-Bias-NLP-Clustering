It commemorates Lincoln\u2019s signing of the House and Senate resolution that later became the 13th Amendment. Lincoln signed the Amendment outlawing slavery on February 1, 1865.\n\nShort of another Civil War, Americans have reached a point verging on the loss of their Constitutional freedoms as ever before. The issue then was slavery, but Americans are rapidly moving toward having their Bill of Rights annulled by a President intent on ruling as a despot, making them slaves of a regime that rules as he wishes, ignoring the Constitution and Congress.\n\nHis actions have been supported by the Democratic members of Congress and because Republicans only control the House they have seen their legislative efforts to oppose the regime blocked, often by one man, Harry Reid, the Senate Majority Leader. The nation\u2019s media with few exceptions have supported or ignored the President\u2019s actions.\n\nWhy is this happening? A brief review of the means put forth in Saul Alinski\u2019s \u201cRules for Radicals\u201d, written by a \u201ccommunity organizer\u201d, outlines what Obama is doing as he seeks to turn America into a socialist state. It is a process that progressives/liberals have been pursuing since early in the last century.\n\n1) Healthcare \u2013 Control healthcare and you control the people.\n\n2) Poverty \u2013 Increase the poverty level as high as possible, poor people are easier to control and will not fight back if you are providing everything for them to live.\n\n3) Debt \u2013 Increase the debt to an unsustainable level. That way you are able to increase taxes, and this will produce more poverty.\n\n4) Gun Control \u2013 Remove the ability to defend themselves from the Government. That way you are able to create a police state.\n\n5) Welfare \u2013 Take control of every aspect of their lives (Food, Housing, and Income).\n\n6) Education \u2013 Take control of what people read and listen to \u2013 take control of what children learn in school.\n\n7) Religion \u2013 Remove the belief in God from the Government and schools.\n\n8) Class Warfare \u2013 Divide the people into the wealthy and the poor. This will cause more discontent and it will be easier to take (tax) the wealthy with the support of the poor.\n\nWe are close to having everything we write and say known to the regime. As Andrew Napolitano asks, \u201cWhat if the government spies on all of us all the time and recognizes no limits to its spying? What if its appetite for acquiring personal knowledge about all Americans is insatiable? What if the government uses the microchips in our cellphones to follow us and listen to us as we move about?\u201d\n\nAnd what if Congress, as World Net Daily\u2019s Bob Unruh has written, has empowered the President to \u201carrest, kidnap, detain without trial and hold indefinitely American citizens thought to \u2018represent an enduring security threat to the United States.\u2019\u201d That\u2019s what the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) does!\n\n\u201cSome of the nation\u2019s most respected legal teams are asking the Supreme Court to take up a challenge to the indefinite-detention provisions\u201d of the Act \u201ccharging that the law has created the framework for a police state.\u201d That\u2019s how far along we are toward the destruction of the U.S. Constitution.\n\n\u201cThe 2014 NDAA was fast-tracked through the U.S. Senate, with no time for discussion or amendments, while most Americans were distracted by the scandal surrounding A&E\u2019s troubles with \u2018Duck Dynasty\u2019 star Phil Robertson. Eighty-five of 100 senators voted in favor of the new version of the NDAA, which had already been quietly passed by the House of Representatives.\u201d\n\nOstensibly a law to address terrorists, the NDAA is a blueprint for a nation in which its citizens have none of the rights spelled out in the Bill of Rights. All it will take is the declaration of martial law or a national emergency.\n\nSen. Ted Cruz, a leading opponent of Obamacare, writing in The Wall Street Journal, said, \u201cOf all the troubling aspects of the Obama presidency, none is more dangerous than the President\u2019s persistent pattern of lawlessness, his willingness to disregard the written law and instead enforce his own policies via executive fiat\u2026the President\u2019s taste for unilateral action to circumvent Congress should concern every citizen, regardless of party or ideology.\u201d\n\nAmericans will soon have little recourse against a government intent on controlling every aspect of their lives, spying on them, and arresting them for criticizing it. A May 16 march on Washington may cause the White House and the Congress to pause in its attacks on our freedom and liberty. One can only hope that millions participate.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://blog.heartland.org/2014/02/americans-are-losing-their-freedom/", "type": "activity", "image": "http://blog.heartland.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/american-flag-voters.jpg", "site_name": "Somewhat Reasonable", "title": "Americans Are Losing Their Freedom"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe21a0\"", "article_summary": "Short of another Civil War, Americans have reached a point verging on the loss of their Constitutional freedoms as ever before.\nA May 16 march on Washington may cause the White House and the Congress to pause in its attacks on our freedom and liberty.\nIt commemorates Lincoln\u2019s signing of the House and Senate resolution that later became the 13th Amendment.\nWhat if its appetite for acquiring personal knowledge about all Americans is insatiable?\n6) Education \u2013 Take control of what people read and listen to \u2013 take control of what children learn in school."}
