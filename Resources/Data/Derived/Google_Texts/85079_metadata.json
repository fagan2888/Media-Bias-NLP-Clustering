We are going to be beautiful. We will make America great again.\u201d\n\nAs of April 27, Donald Trump had won the state of Pa. with 56.7% of the vote, awarding him 17 delegates.", "article_metadata": {"language": "en, sv", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Beacon", "description": "More than 10,000 individuals across Northeastern Pa. gathered at the Mohegan Sun Arena at Casey Plaza on April 25 for the Donald Trump rally, just one day before the Pa. primary.
