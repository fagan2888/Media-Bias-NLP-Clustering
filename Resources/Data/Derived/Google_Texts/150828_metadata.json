The massive explosion that left fifteen people dead, 160 injured and at least 500 homes destroyed occurred about 20 minutes after the fire began.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\n\u201cWe have come to this conclusion through over 400 interviews, a systematic fire scene examination, considering witness observations, viewing both witness photographs and video, as well as extensive scientific testing,\u201d Elder told the reporters. The testing was conducted at the ATF\u2019s laboratory in Maryland.\n\nAt this time, the ATF stated that no arrests have been made in the case. Elder stated they had \u201cmany leads\u201d as a result of their interviews and investigation.\n\nThe video below captures the intensity of the explosion at the 1:25 mark.\n\nShortly after the explosion, Breitbart Texas Managing Director Brandon Darby traveled to West to cover the tragedy and help with a Tea Party led relief effort to assist the victims of the explosion, Breitbart News reported. Darby had extensive experience with relief efforts in post-Katrina New Orleans and was then running Citizen Patriot Response, a group that mobilizes Tea Party and other liberty-minded groups to help communities in need. Darby began sorting through the fog of disaster and reporting the facts to the public-at-large shorty after last night\u2019s tragic accident and continued reporting from the scene for several days.\n\nThe explosion in 2013 occurred at the West Fertilizer Company on April 17, 2013. Since that time, state and federal officials have been investigating the explosion. Officials said they have ruled out \u201call reasonable, accidental, and natural causes,\u201d The Washington Post reported Wednesday.\n\nThe ATF reportedly spent over $2 million in the investigation. The agency is offering a $50,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of the person or people responsible for starting the fire.\n\nElder noted that 12 of the 15 people killed in the explosion were first responders. \u201cThese individuals were people serving their community in a volunteer capacity,\u201d Elder told the gathered reporters. \u201cThey are true community servants. They lost their life serving their community and they deserve the best that we can give them.\u201d\n\nBob Price serves as associate editor and senior political news contributor for Breitbart Texas and is a member of the original Breitbart Texas team.
