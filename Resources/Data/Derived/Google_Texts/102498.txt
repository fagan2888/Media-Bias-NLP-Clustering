Two wrecks in different regions of Kansas killed two out-of-state motorists Saturday morning, according to Kansas Highway Patrol reports.

In the first, authorities in Graham County in north-central Kansas responded around 4 a.m. to a one-vehicle wreck with a driver ejection.

The scene was on 190th Avenue just south of Q Road, which is about 2.5 miles south of Penokee.

Troopers said a 2004 Ford F-150 pickup truck was northbound on the county road when it went over a hill, lost control and went into the west ditch. The pickup then veered back right and went into the north ditch, hit an embankment, spun north and rolled several times.

The vehicle came to rest on its wheels in a feed field after the driver was ejected, troopers said.

The highway patrol identified the fatality victim as Dylan R. Herlevich, 25, of Littleton, Colo. He was pronounced dead on scene.

A passenger, Bryce K. Critchfield, 20, of Glade, suffered disabling injuries and was taken to an area hospital.

Troopers said neither men was wearing a seat belt.

In the second fatal crash, authorities in Cherokee County in extreme southeast Kansas responded at 7:45 a.m. to a head-on collision. The scene was on eastbound US-166 highway about a half mile east of US-69A highway.

Troopers said a 2010 Toyota Sedan was westbound on US-166 when it lost control and went into eastbound traffic, colliding head-on with a 2010 Hyundai Elantra.

Troopers said the driver of the Sedan, Justin R. Oldham, 35, of Carthage, Mo., was taken to an area hospital where he was pronounced dead.

Ashley Marten, 34, of Carterville, Mo., was a passenger in the vehicle. She suffered unspecified injuries and was taken to a local hospital.

The highway patrol reported neither wore a seat belt.

The two occupants of the Elantra — Brandy Renee Potts, 32, and Shelby L. Dunaway, both of Pittsburg — sustained unspecified injuries and were taken to an area hospital.

Both were reported to be wearing seat belts.
