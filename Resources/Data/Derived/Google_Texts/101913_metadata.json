In a story coming from (where else\u2026) New York City, the wise school officials, ever concerned about the health and future of their students, decided to check out what each of the kids weighs, matching the results against some Body Mass Index chart. Upon noting that many of the children failed to pass muster, they decided to inform the parents\u2026 by handing the kids notes to take home. What could possibly go wrong?\n\nA New York City mom was fit to be tied Wednesday after her 4-foot-1, 66-pound daughter came home from school with a note calling her fat. Eight-year-old Gwendolyn Williams is anything but fat, but her mom worries that the school\u2019s note, citing her body mass index, has left her daughter confused about her body. \u201cMy daughter is thin; she knows she doesn\u2019t have a weight problem, but that night, I caught her grabbing the skin near her waist, and she asked me, \u2018is this what they were talking about?\u201d\u2018 Laura Bruiji Williams, the girl\u2019s mom, told FoxNews.com. \u201cIt was awful to see.\u201d Gwendolyn, along with her classmates, were handed a \u201cFitnessgram\u201d sealed with a sticker at her public school in Brooklyn. The class was told not to open the letters, issued by the New York City Department of Education, but like most of her friends, she couldn\u2019t resist and read it.\n\nWho could have possibly predicted that a group of curious pre-teens, having been handed mysterious notes for their parents carrying instructions not to open them, would go ahead and open them anyway? Probably anyone with any experience whatsoever with children and one half the common sense that God gave a goat. But not in this school!\n\nBut perhaps more disturbing is the idea that an eight year old who weighs in at 66 pounds was somehow off the bell curve on the fat end. Are they just trying to encourage bulimia in the next generation? Does this girl really look fat to you?\n\nWelcome to New York. And with that greeting out of the way, flee as you value your lives. This place is a lost cause.\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "Fatso", "title": "Only in NY \u2013 School hands 66 lb girl note saying she\u2019s fat", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2014/05/24/only-in-ny-school-hands-66-lb-girl-note-saying-shes-fat/", "image": "http://media.hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/ThisGirl.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "keywords": "nanny state, New York, New York City, schools,", "article": {"published_time": "2014-05-24T21:31:21+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-05-24T14:54:39+00:00"}, "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd70c8\"", "article_summary": "A New York City mom was fit to be tied Wednesday after her 4-foot-1, 66-pound daughter came home from school with a note calling her fat.\nOnly in NY \u2013 School hands 66 lb girl note saying she\u2019s fatposted at 5:31 pm on May 24, 2014 by Jazz ShawTales from the Nanny State continue to the amazement of nobody, I\u2019m sure.\nEight-year-old Gwendolyn Williams is anything but fat, but her mom worries that the school\u2019s note, citing her body mass index, has left her daughter confused about her body.\nThe class was told not to open the letters, issued by the New York City Department of Education, but like most of her friends, she couldn\u2019t resist and read it.\n\u201cIt was awful to see.\u201d Gwendolyn, along with her classmates, were handed a \u201cFitnessgram\u201d sealed with a sticker at her public school in Brooklyn."}
