Various controversial comments made by Obamacare “architect” Jonathan Gruber about the “lack of transparency” and “stupidity of the American voter” that he claims helped Democrats pass the law have been dominating conservative media outlets over the last week. But as CNN’s Brian Stelter put it on Thursday, the story is “barely” registering outside of that partisan bubble.

On Friday, Sen. Chris Murphy (D-CT) sent out a tweet that criticized “good political journalists” for giving the Gruber story credence:

It's sad to me that good political journalists are spending so much time on these irrelevant comments by this guy Gruber. — Chris Murphy (@ChrisMurphyCT) November 15, 2014

As someone who did spend time this week covering Gruber’s comments, CNN’s Jake Tapper took offense to this assessment and responded:

@ChrisMurphyCT respectfully, it's sad to me that some politicians would claim the comments are irrelevant — Jake Tapper (@jaketapper) November 15, 2014

In the world of cable news, the story has been given exponentially more coverage by right-leaning Fox News than either of the other two major networks. A search of TVEyes transcripts for this past Monday through Friday shows that CNN mentioned the name “Gruber” 16 times, MSNBC said it 17 times and Fox News referenced the man and his comments a whopping 230 times, with 73 of those coming on Friday alone.
