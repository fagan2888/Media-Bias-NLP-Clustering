Police have released more details, including the name of a motorcycle rider who died, in a collision Sunday morning on South Harrison Road.

Just before 11:30 a.m., 46-year-old Nobel Thorpe was driving a 2001 Harley Davidson motorcycle southbound on Harrison in the lane closest to the median, according to Tucson Police Sgt. Kimberly Bay.

Bay said the driver of a 1997 Ford F-150 was eastbound on East 32nd Street, where he had a stop sign at Harrison. He emerged from his stop and began to cross Harrison, and Thorpe, who had no stop sign, collided with the truck. He was transported to Banner University Medical Center with life-threatening injuries and died shortly after arriving at the hospital. Next of kin have been notified.

The driver of the truck remained at the scene and was cited for "failure to yield from a stop sign" and "collision causing death by a moving violation."

Investigators said speed and alcohol do not appear to be factors in the collision, according to Bay.
