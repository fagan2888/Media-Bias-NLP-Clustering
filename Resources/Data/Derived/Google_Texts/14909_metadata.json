Sheridan. Tom Faudree, regional organizer for ColoradoCareYES, will give a presentation about the proposal.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act's opt-out clause gives states an opportunity to use a waiver if they can meet or exceed ACA standards to design their own health care financing system by Medicaid waivers and by a Health Care Premium Tax on payroll and non-payroll income collected by the Department of Revenue (http://bit.ly/1NqA1L8).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNew York Times bestselling author T.R. Reid, a spokesperson for ColoradoCareYES, said his group is dedicated to the proposition that \"a decent, ethical democracy should provide health care for everybody.\"\n\n\"Even with the Obamacare expansion, the U.S. is going to have 31 million people uninsured in 2020 \u2014 that's the Congressional Budget Office estimate \u2014 about 370,000 people in Colorado today don't have health insurance, 30,000 of them are kids under the age of 16,\" he said during a phone interview with the Daily Record on Friday. \"We think that's wrong \u2014 we think that everybody in Colorado should have access to a doctor when she needs it, and our initiative would provide that at low cost.\"\n\nReid is the author of \"The Healing of America, A Global Quest for Better, Cheaper, and Fairer Health Care,\" a documentary filmmaker, and a former reporter with the Washington Post. \"The Healing of America\" and his 2008 documentary, \"Sick Around the World,\" both examine how other developed countries in the world provide high-quality universal health coverage for everyone at a fraction of the cost that Americans pay ( http://bit.ly/1Oouw0i).\n\nReid said he is confident the initiative will garner the required 99,000 valid signatures by Oct. 23 to be placed on the 2016 ballot.\n\n\"It gives Coloradans the choice between ColoradoCare or Obamacare,\" he said. \"If you vote against ColoradoCare, you are voting to stay with Obamacare, which we have now.\"\n\nColoradoCare is expected to save almost every family and every business money, he said.\n\n\"Most families are going to pay less for health insurance than they do now, the only exception is very wealthy people,\" Reid said. \"People with an income above about $225,000 a year are going to pay more, but most people and businesses will pay less, and the coverage will be better.\"\n\nThrough ColoradoCare, there would be no network because every doctor, chiropractor and hospital would be covered, Reid said.\n\n\"Under ColoradoCare, you choose the doctor, you choose the hospital, and insurance will pay,\" he said. \"In the current system, insurance company chooses the doctors you can see.\"\n\nThose who have questions about Wednesday's meeting may call 285-8980.
