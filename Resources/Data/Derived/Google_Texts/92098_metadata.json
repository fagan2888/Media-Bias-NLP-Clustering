Neil Abercrombie. \u201cHawaii residents are seeing the benefit of collaboration between state government agencies, insurers and nonprofit stakeholders in the implementation of the federal Affordable Care Act. We are working together toward our shared goal of universal healthcare and ensuring access to quality health care for everyone in our state.\u201d\n\nStarting Oct. 1, the Hawaii Health Connector will begin offering plans approved by the Insurance Division. Those plans will be ranked by \u201cmetal\u201d levels:\n\nplatinum with a 90/10 cost share;\n\ngold at 80/20;\n\nsilver at 70/30; and\n\nbronze at 60/40\n\nBeyond that, the individual\u2019s coverage will be adjusted for age, family size, and tobacco use.\n\nCompared to the results of a study published by the Kaiser Family Foundation, Hawaii\u2019s rates before tax credits and reimbursement estimates for a 40-year-old resident at $217 would be the third lowest.\n\n1. Portland, Ore. $201\n\n2. Albuquerque, NM $212\n\n3. Honolulu $217\n\n19. Burlington, VM $413\n\nIn a comparison of analysis done by Avalere Health, the Insurance Division\u2019s actuaries found that Hawaii has the lowest average monthly plan rate in each of the four metal levels before tax credits and reimbursement estimates.\n\n[table id=1 /]\n\nAvalere Health Study Comparison (40-year-old Nonsmoker)\n\n[table id=2 /]\n\nAvalere Health Study Comparison (Silver Level Nonsmoker)\n\n[table id=3 /]\n\nThose going to the Hawaii Health Connector to explore their health insurance options will be able to see if they qualify for tax credits and other reimbursements. Individuals under 400 percent of the federal poverty level ($52,920 for an individual and $108,360 for a family of four) can have their net out-of-pocket cost to purchase health insurance reduced.\n\nThese costs are averages, and individuals should go to the HawaiiHealthConnector.com or contact HHC\u2019s marketplace assisters to get the best idea on what they can expect to pay.\n\n\u201cThe Insurance Division put in many long hours to approve a high number of health plans that Hawaii residents will be able to choose from when they go to the Hawaii Health Connector,\u201d Insurance Commissioner Gordon Ito said. \u201cOur team approved 95 base plans for the HHC alone.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am proud of the additional hard work the Insurance Division and Commissioner Ito put in to help Hawaii consumers,\u201d DCCA Director Kealii S. Lopez said. \u201cThey overcame tight time constraints to approve the high number of plans. This is a more than 500 percent increase in the number of plans they approve in previous years.\u201d\n\nA key provision under the Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) is that everyone must have health insurance starting on Jan. 1, 2014. To accomplish this, ACA prohibits health insurers from denying the purchase of health insurance if a person had a preexisting medical condition. Everyone can purchase a policy regardless of your health status.\n\nSmall business with 25 employees or less could qualify for a small business tax credit of up to 50 percent of the cost of health insurance to help offset the cost of providing health insurance to their employees. Presently, the tax credit is up to 35 percent. The amount of the credit depends on the size of the business and the average wage of its employees.\n\nOn Oct. 1, 2013, individuals and small business owners can do their comparison shopping and check with the Hawaii Health Connector to see what benefits, tax credits and rates they will be eligible for. They can sign up for a plan but the insurance coverage will not start until Jan. 1, 2014.\n\nThe Hawaii Insurance Division oversees the state\u2019s insurance industry; issues licenses; examines the fiscal condition of Hawaii-based companies; reviews rate and policy filings; and investigates insurance related complaints.\n\nFACEBOOK COMMENTS", "article_metadata": {"og": {"description": "HONOLULU \u2013 The Department of Commerce and Consumer Affairs (DCCA) Insurance Division's completed analysis of individual rates approved for the Hawaii Health Connector found that the plans are so far among the lowest in cost in the nation.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe State of Hawaii continues to be a leader in our", "title": "Analysis of Hawaii's Health Insurance Rates under Obamacare", "locale": "en_US", "updated_time": "2013-09-20T11:19:58+00:00", "url": "http://www.bigislandvideonews.com/2013/09/20/analysis-of-hawaiis-individual-health-insurance-rates-under-obamacare/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Analysis of Hawaii's Health Insurance Rates under Obamacare"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "fb": {"app_id": 196112740446193}, "article": {"section": "Uncategorized", "published_time": "2013-09-20T10:43:44+00:00", "modified_time": "2013-09-20T11:19:58+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0adf\"", "article_summary": "The Hawaii Insurance Division oversees the state\u2019s insurance industry; issues licenses; examines the fiscal condition of Hawaii-based companies; reviews rate and policy filings; and investigates insurance related complaints.\nTo accomplish this, ACA prohibits health insurers from denying the purchase of health insurance if a person had a preexisting medical condition.\n\u201cThe Insurance Division put in many long hours to approve a high number of health plans that Hawaii residents will be able to choose from when they go to the Hawaii Health Connector,\u201d Insurance Commissioner Gordon Ito said.\nSmall business with 25 employees or less could qualify for a small business tax credit of up to 50 percent of the cost of health insurance to help offset the cost of providing health insurance to their employees.\n[table id=1 /]Avalere Health Study Comparison (40-year-old Nonsmoker)[table id=2 /]Avalere Health Study Comparison (Silver Level Nonsmoker)[table id=3 /]Those going to the Hawaii Health Connector to explore their health insurance options will be able to see if they qualify for tax credits and other reimbursements."}
