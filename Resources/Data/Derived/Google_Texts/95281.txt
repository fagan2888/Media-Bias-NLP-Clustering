It's safe to say learning is not the same as it was when we were in school. Technology is constantly changing the face of education.

News 9â€™s Justin Dougherty shows us, gone are the days of pencils, paper, and textbooks.

If you step into your child's classroom today, chances are you'll find them using tablets or laptops to learn.

Now, the emphasis is going toward movement.

A company in Denmark has developed what it calls the "Wize Floor." It's basically transforms a classroom floor into an interactive learning tool. The company says the floor has only been around for a few years, and more schools are using it to help teach children with special needs.

The "Wize Floor" can also be used to help children who struggle with traditional forms of learning.

"Some kids just learn better by moving, some kids learn really well by sitting still engaging with a book, but some kids have trouble just sitting and not doing anything. They learn better when they use their body and they remember things much better when they use their body as a way of doing it," said Kaspar Rosengreen Nielsen, WizeFloor.

The company says it hopes to expand the "Wize Floor" into other countries in the near future.
