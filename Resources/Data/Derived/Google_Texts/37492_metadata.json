Terry Branstad\u2019s decision to shift management of the state\u2019s Medicaid program to private companies. Clinton, the front-running Democratic candidate for president, posted a statement Tuesday on the blog-publishing website Medium.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very wary of proposals like this because when Republicans say \u2018privatize services,\u2019 too often they mean cut services,\u201d Clinton\u2019s post said.\n\nBranstad\u2019s administration is in the process of turning over management of the state\u2019s $4.2 billion Medicaid program, which delivers health care services to a half-million low-income and disabled Iowans, to four companies selected from a bidding process.\n\nThe administration says the transition is needed to rein in expanding program costs while preserving services.\n\nCritics say the move could result in reduced services when the program is operated by for-profit private companies.\n\n\u201cMedicaid is essential for nearly one in five Iowans. We should focus on strengthening programs like Medicaid and Medicare, rather than putting benefits at risk,\u201d Clinton\u2019s post said. \u201cAnd we should ensure that any company involved in administering the program goes through a thorough process of due diligence.\u201d\n\nIn response to Clinton\u2019s statement, Branstad spokesman Ben Hammes noted Clinton\u2019s home state of New York has millions of patients on Medicaid managed care plans, and that New York has partnered with three of the same companies as Iowa.\n\n\u201cGov. Branstad wants to work with people regardless of party on how we can improve Medicaid in Iowa and not simply accept status quo,\u201d Hammes said in an email to the Des Moines Bureau. \u201cWe are taking steps to modernize and improve Medicaid in Iowa, following in the footsteps of many other states, including New York, aiming to improve patient outcomes and improving efficiency.\u201d\n\nClinton\u2019s campaign has posted a digital petition on its website opposing the state\u2019s privatization of Medicaid management.\n\nClinton, along with her fellow Democratic candidates, returns to Iowa this weekend for the Iowa Democratic Party\u2019s fall fundraiser.\n\n\u201cInstead of unilaterally turning Medicaid benefits over to private companies without demonstrating an effective plan to deliver savings and quality to Iowans, Gov. Branstad should come to realize that the Affordable Care Act is working and partner with Democrats to build on this effort,\u201d Clinton\u2019s post said.", "article_metadata": {"Description": "The Gazette | DES MOINES - Hillary Clinton continues to speak her mind on state issues in the first-in-the-nation caucus state.On Tuesday, she joined critics of Iowa Gov.
