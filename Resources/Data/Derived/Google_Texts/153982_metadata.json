It's comical. When Hillary Clinton tries to do the same thing in a real life election cycle, it's 'pathetic.' So said the \"Morning Joe\" panel on MSNBC Tuesday morning.\n\n\u201cThat was pathetic,\u201d Brzezinski said. \u201cI know that she\u2019s the front-runner. I\u2019m sure she\u2019s going to win, and I\u2019m glad. I want a Democrat to win, but that was like Veep. That was Veep. It was worse than Veep. It wasn\u2019t funny.\u201d\n\nOver the weekend, Bernie Sanders threw some direct criticism Clinton's way regarding gun control, saying 'all the shouting in the world' won't keep guns out of criminals' hands. Clinton apparently couldn't take the heat without using the gender card.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t been shouting, but sometimes when a woman speaks out, some people think it\u2019s shouting,\u201d she said.\n\nClinton's over sensitivity disgusted the \"Morning Joe\" panel. Brzezinski, who, as indicated above, is a Hillary supporter, could not help calling out her campaign's 'stupidity.'\n\n\u201cI know sexism,\" she said. \"Hillary Clinton knows sexism. She should know better than to let her staff make her do that. It needs to be her. She needs to get out there and talk. Everyone stop writing lines for her. They\u2019re bad. Really bad. When we talk about sexism, when we talk about women and equal pay and all these things that are important, let\u2019s not denigrate it with that stupidity, because we embarrass ourselves.\u201d\n\nLooks like that Clinton staff drought on \"Morning Joe\" will continue.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Worse than VEEP..05/26/2016 19:24:21PM EST.", "author": "Cortney O'Brien", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Worse than VEEP.", "title": "'Morning Joe' Calls Out Hillary Campaign 'Stupidity' for Claiming Bernie Sanders is Sexist", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/cortneyobrien/2015/10/28/morning-joe-calls-hillary-campaign-pathetic-for-claiming-bernie-sanders-is-sexist-n2071894", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/uploads/2015/10/27/37.png", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Worse than VEEP.", "title": "'Morning Joe' Calls Out Hillary Campaign 'Stupidity' for Claiming Bernie Sanders is Sexist", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/cortneyobrien/2015/10/28/morning-joe-calls-hillary-campaign-pathetic-for-claiming-bernie-sanders-is-sexist-n2071894", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/uploads/2015/10/27/37.png", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "'Morning Joe' Calls Out Hillary Campaign 'Stupidity' for Claiming Bernie Sanders Is Sexist, Cortney O'Brien, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "So said the \"Morning Joe\" panel on MSNBC Tuesday morning.\nWhen Hillary Clinton tries to do the same thing in a real life election cycle, it's 'pathetic.'\nClinton's over sensitivity disgusted the \"Morning Joe\" panel.\n\"Hillary Clinton knows sexism.\n\u201cI know sexism,\" she said."}
