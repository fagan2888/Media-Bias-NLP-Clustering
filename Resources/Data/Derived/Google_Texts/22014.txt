Mike Pompeo and Todd Tiahrt

The race for the Kansas 4th District Congressional seat is about as hot as the July weather right now.

Representative Mike Pompeo is being challenged by the former holder of that seat -- Todd Tiahrt. Wichita State University Political Science Professor Ken Ciboski says the race is following a familiar pattern.

Ciboski says, "It's about the candidates themselves. It's really not about issues."

Ciboski has seen it for many years,.saying the Pompeo Tiahrt race is shaking out to be a real mudslinger.

"The primaries are always dangerous in this regard for any candidate. There's always going to be mudslinging. You're under a lot of scrutiny because it's about the personalities involved."

He says the commercials by the "Kansans For Responsible Government" political action committee are hurling the most mud in hopes of some of it sticking on Pompeo.

From the day he announced, former Congressman Todd Tiahrt, has campaigned on connecting Congressman Pompeo to Obamacare.

But Ciboski says Pompeo hasn't supported Obamacare.

"IS THERE ANYTHING TO IT THOUGH? No. That's what I'm getting ready to say. What it is is it's part of a bill, part of an overall major funding bill or something like that. Do you as a member of congress do you want to vote against that when there are other things in that you really want? Congressman Pompeo has been adamant again, again and again. He said it in my classes. He said Obamacare is what's driving our costs, driving inflation. He's opposed to it very vociferously.

Ciboski says don't expect much to change between now and the August 5th primary.
