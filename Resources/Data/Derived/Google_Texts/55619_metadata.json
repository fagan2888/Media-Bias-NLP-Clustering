Gallup finds that 69 percent of Americans view big government as the biggest threat in the future. The figure is slightly down from 2013, where it stood at 72 percent. For those \u201cFeeling the Bern,\u201d we regret to inform you that only 25 percent feel that big business is a threat, followed by big labor at six percent. Another interesting aspect is the number of Democrats and Independent voters who also feel big government is a problem.\n\nOf course, almost every Republican\u201388 percent\u2013agrees that big government poses the biggest threat to the country. But 53 percent of Democrats feel the same way, along with 67 percent of Independents. That\u2019s a double-digit gain from 2009-10, where only 32 percent of Democrats felt we should fear our government\u2019s power. Maybe that was before the gears of Obamacare started to move.\n\nNevertheless, it\u2019s interesting that the party who pushed through Obamacare, the epitome of big government policy, and one that thinks more government power concentrated in Washington would strengthen the socioeconomic fabric of the country feels that big government is our greatest threat.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Shocker!.05/27/2016 10:14:05AM EST.", "author": "Matt Vespa", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Shocker!", "title": "Poll: Big Government Is The Biggest Threat To Our Future", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/mattvespa/2015/12/24/poll-big-government-is-the-biggest-threat-to-our-future-n2096896", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015/76/2015-03-17T155514Z_1_LYNXMPEB2G0TE_RTROPTP_3_USA-OBAMA-SPEECH.JPG", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Shocker!", "title": "Poll: Big Government Is The Biggest Threat To Our Future", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/mattvespa/2015/12/24/poll-big-government-is-the-biggest-threat-to-our-future-n2096896", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015/76/2015-03-17T155514Z_1_LYNXMPEB2G0TE_RTROPTP_3_USA-OBAMA-SPEECH.JPG", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Poll: Big Government Is The Biggest Threat To Our Future, Matt Vespa, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "Gallup finds that 69 percent of Americans view big government as the biggest threat in the future.\nOf course, almost every Republican\u201388 percent\u2013agrees that big government poses the biggest threat to the country.\nFor those \u201cFeeling the Bern,\u201d we regret to inform you that only 25 percent feel that big business is a threat, followed by big labor at six percent.\nAnother interesting aspect is the number of Democrats and Independent voters who also feel big government is a problem.\nBut 53 percent of Democrats feel the same way, along with 67 percent of Independents."}
