Though some of these children show signs of the enterovirus, doctors still aren\u2019t sure whether the two illnesses are related.\n\nThe main symptoms of acute flaccid myelitis involve limb weakness and even paralysis. Most of the 100 children infected with the illness haven\u2019t shown improvement, and only one has recovered completely.\n\n\u201cSince September 2014, [the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] CDC and partners have been investigating reports of children across the United States who developed a sudden onset of weakness in one or more arms or legs with MRI scans that showed inflammation of the gray matter \u2014 nerve cells \u2014 in the spinal cord,\u201d according to the CDC. \u201cThis illness is now being referred to as acute flaccid myelitis.\u201d\n\nMost of the children who had fallen ill with acute flaccid myelitis experienced respiratory problems in the weeks prior, such as coughing and difficulty breathing, followed by a fever and weakness in the limbs. Finally, paralysis symptoms began appearing. The average age of the affected patients is around 7.6 years old, according to the CDC, and almost all of them were hospitalized.\n\nSome of the kids infected showed signs of the enterovirus 68 \u2014 a respiratory infection that attacked children last fall \u2014 but 71 of them had spinal fluid devoid of any enterovirus.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s unsatisfying to have an illness and not know what caused it,\u201d Dr. Samuel Dominguez, an epidemiologist and infectious disease specialist at Children\u2019s Hospital Colorado (which saw most of the first cases), told The New York Times. If it\u2019s not the enterovirus 68, it\u2019s possible that the virus is simply one that doctors haven\u2019t discovered yet.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "mystery, illness, acute, flaccid, myelitis, spreads, kids, across, us, it, caused, enterovirus", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Over 100 children have been hospitalized with a strange new illness that causes paralysis, but does it have anything to do with the enterovirus 68?", "title": "Mysterious Illness Spreads To Kids: Is It Caused By The Enterovirus?
