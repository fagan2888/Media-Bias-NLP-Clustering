That message by Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell came just days before Sunday's start of Obamacare open enrollment, and as HHS fights to retain existing insurance customers in government-run health exchanges so as to push overall enrollment numbers higher in 2016.



It also came days after HHS released data about premium prices for 2016 that underscore the fact that returning Obamacare customers run the risk of being surprised by higher-than-expected monthly premiums if they accept automatic re-enrollment in their current plans.

Burwell cited a new report which showed that Obamacare customers who re-enrolled in the same level of health coverage last year — but who switched to a different insurance plan — saved an average of almost $33 per month in premiums, or nearly $400 annually compared to what they would have paid if they stayed in the same plan.

And those who switched "issuers," or insurers, within the same level of coverage saved even more: an average of $41 per month, or more than $490 annually.

Those savings were realized after accounting for subsidies that most Obamacare enrollees on government-run marketplaces receive to help lower the cost of their monthly premiums.
