Insurance Commissioner Mike Kreidler\u2019s disappointed the companies are seeking such a large increase, but understands their predicament.\n\n\u201cThat hurts people. And I want to do everything I possibly can to make sure that we don\u2019t see this in the future. But that said, it\u2019s still part of the shakedown period, where insurers didn\u2019t know what they should be charging.\u201d\n\nKreidler thinks the insurers now have a better handle on their costs after a couple of years under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nHe claims if rates do increase, people in Washington who can\u2019t afford them will benefit from a boost in government subsidies.\n\nIt\u2019ll be Kreidler\u2019s decision to grant or deny rate increase requests by insurers. He notes any determination he makes can be challenged in court.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never had that happen in the past. I don\u2019t want to start a trend. So I\u2019ve got to be careful that where I push back on them, they\u2019re going to recognize that that is the appropriate answer to the question, and it means not getting as much of a rate increase as they had proposed.\u201d\n\nKreidler says despite the requested rate hikes, the Washington health care exchange is in good shape. He notes a large percentage of participants don\u2019t even qualify for subsidies, meaning they\u2019re choosing to work through the exchange.\n\nKreidler\u2019s post as Washington Insurance Commissioner is a partisan position. He was elected as a Democrat.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act is a product of Democratic President Barak Obama\u2019s administration. It became law with no Republican backing in Congress.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "KPQ", "description": "Health insurance companies selling individual policies in Washington want to increase rates by an average of 13.5 percent next year.
