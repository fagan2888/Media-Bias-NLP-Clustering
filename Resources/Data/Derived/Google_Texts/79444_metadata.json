I didn\u2019t realize Paisley is, or was, something of an Obama fan. Maybe he\u2019s joined the ranks of the disenchanted or maybe he simply couldn\u2019t resist a gag he knew would kill with a red-state audience. The biggest laugh: The deer-in-the-headlights look near the end from Taylor Swift, who\u2019s either (a) afraid to show annoyance lest it raise an eyebrow among her country fans, (b) afraid to laugh lest it raise an eyebrow among her pop fans, or (c) deeply confused at what Paisley and Underwood are talking about. Smart money\u2019s on door number three.\n\nWhile we\u2019re on the subject, I missed this bit from Sebelius\u2019s testimony yesterday. Has the \u201ctech surge\u201d improved the site to the point where users can at least expect \u201cObamaCare by late evening\u201d now? Maybe not:\n\nFor someone who bet so much on a successful \u201ctech surge,\u201d though, Sebelius acknowledged that the rescue effort right now is \u201cnot where we need to be.\u201d\u2026 Sebelius told Baucus there have been \u201ca couple of hundred functional fixes that have been identified,\u201d and that there has been \u201cpriority grouping\u201d for the most important ones \u2014 especially the reporting problems that have left insurers unsure whether they\u2019re getting the right information on their new customers. Jeff Zients, the former Obama administration economic adviser who is running the repair operation, has called the list of repairs a \u201cpunch list.\u201d And Sebelius said there has been real progress, especially in making the site run faster and making sure customers are \u201cseeing far fewer error messages and timeouts.\u201d But she hinted she still wasn\u2019t satisfied. \u201cI would say we\u2019re into the list. We\u2019re not where we need to be. It\u2019s a pretty aggressive schedule to get to the entire punch list,\u201d Sebelius said.\n\nHHS documents released by Issa\u2019s committee show that on September 30, the day before the launch of the biggest government health-care initiative in decades, whose success rests almost entirely on a well-functioning website capable of processing millions of enrollments, Healthcare.gov was able to handle \u2026 1,100 concurrent users before the site\u2019s response time got \u201ctoo high.\u201d As a point of comparison, there are nearly 5,000 concurrent users on Hot Air as I\u2019m writing this. Total number of HHS employees fired so far: Zero.\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "Charts.", "title": "New Brad Paisley/Carrie Underwood duet: \u201cObamaCare by morning\u201d", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2013/11/07/new-brad-paisleycarrie-underwood-duet-obamacare-by-morning/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "article": {"published_time": "2013-11-07T16:21:11+00:00", "modified_time": "2013-11-07T17:23:56+00:00"}, "keywords": "cmas, ObamaCare, paisley, swift, underwood,", "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1931\"", "article_summary": "New Brad Paisley/Carrie Underwood duet: \u201cObamaCare by morning\u201dposted at 11:21 am on November 7, 2013 by AllahpunditVia the WFB.\nHas the \u201ctech surge\u201d improved the site to the point where users can at least expect \u201cObamaCare by late evening\u201d now?\nIt\u2019s a pretty aggressive schedule to get to the entire punch list,\u201d Sebelius said.\nMaybe he\u2019s joined the ranks of the disenchanted or maybe he simply couldn\u2019t resist a gag he knew would kill with a red-state audience.\nI didn\u2019t realize Paisley is, or was, something of an Obama fan."}
