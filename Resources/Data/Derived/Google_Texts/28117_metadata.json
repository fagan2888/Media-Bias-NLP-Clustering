The question is how much.\u201d\n\nIndustry officials tell Fox that some insurance companies have privately reported up to 30 percent of enrollees have not paid up, while other companies believe a higher percentage of customers have taken care of their premiums. The senior insurance industry source suggested it averages out to roughly 10 to 25 percent of enrollees not yet paying into the system, and thus those individuals do not really have insurance.\n\nScenarios for not paying include people who went through the struggles of logging on to HealthCare.gov and eventually decided it was not worth it to go through the final steps of payment, and others who may simply not be able to afford the premiums. Industry officials believe others have gone through the process of choosing a plan and simply have not gotten around to writing a check, but eventually may make the payment to complete the process and wind up being a success story.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to pinpoint precisely how many people have paid their premiums, since companies like Humana and United have not yet disclosed numbers. Aetna has said that 70 percent of their enrollees paid premiums in January, and of those who signed up before January, 90 percent paid their premiums. WellPoint has reported that a majority of its 500,000 enrollees have paid premiums but not a \u201cvast majority\u201d as of yet.\n\nInsurance industry officials are also raising questions about whether the White House really does not know how many people have paid into the system, as White House Press Secretary Jay Carney has suggested.\n\nPressed by Fox on Wednesday about how many of the 3.3 million enrollees have paid premiums, Carney said the data rests with the industry. \u201cIt is a contract between an individual or \u2013 well an individual even representing his or her family \u2013 and a private insurance provider,\u201d he said. \u201cSo insurance companies obviously have data about when those payments were made, but this would be no different from any other insurance contract that you would \u2013 you would purchase.\u201d\n\nA senior insurance industry source said the administration actually does have at least a rough idea of how many people have paid into the system because that determines who gets government subsidies, so the administration has to eventually know who\u2019s paying into the system in order to make sure subsidies are going to the right people.\n\nAs a rough example, an industry source said if a consumer has to pay a $100 monthly premium for coverage and the government subsidy is worth $80, the consumer only pays the $20 difference to the insurance company. The $80 subsidy is later paid by the government directly to the insurance company, so the insurance companies have to show the administration who is paying into the system in order to get that reimbursement.\n\nAn administration official confirmed that the key federal agency involved does get some payment data, but stressed the administration is more focused on getting the payment system completed over the long term.\n\n\u201cCMS receives aggregate-level enrollment data on a monthly basis from issuers that are owed payments of marketplace financial assistance,\u201d said the official. \u201cHowever, enrollments on the individual level for all issuers will be measured in the long term\u201d using documents known as 834 forms.\n\nThe official added that some health plans have already begun providing those forms, \u201cwhich will eventually be the mechanism for making payment and reporting enrollment data as part of our automated system.\u201d Once that system is fully operational, the official said, \u201cwe will determine the most appropriate way to make detailed payment information available.\u201d\n\nEd Henry currently serves as Fox News Channel's (FNC) chief White House correspondent.
