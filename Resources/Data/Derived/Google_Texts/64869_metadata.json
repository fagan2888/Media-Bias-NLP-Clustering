It found that between 1998 and 2010, rates of pain increased by almost 12 percent for patients in their last year of life, while rates of depression increased 26.6 percent and periodic confusion went up by 31.3 percent.\n\n\"We've put a lot of work into [improving end-of-life care] and it's not yielding what we thought it should be yielding. So what do we do now?\" asked Joanne Lynn, M.D., one of the study's authors, according to NPR.\n\nOne possible reason for the backslide in care quality can be found in another study, published in JAMA Internal Medicine, which surveyed doctors, nurses and medical residents in 13 university-based hospitals in Canada.\n\nBased on the clinicians' observations, researchers found that discussions about end-of-life care are most often hampered by patients and their family members. The most common reasons cited were: both patients and their families' difficulty accepting a poor prognosis, limited understanding of life-sustaining treatment options, disagreement among family members about care goals, and patients' inability to make decisions about their own care.\n\nBut the study doesn't let clinicians--or their employers--off the hook so easily. Researchers note that 60.3 of the doctors and nurses polled reported they had not been formally trained about how to discuss goals of care with dying patients and their families.\n\nIn an attempt to address this problem, Massachusetts recently became the first state to require physicians to offer end-of-life planning to patients, FiercePracticeManagement reported. One institution has called for a solution called \"Code Comfort,\" which encourages healthcare organizations to treat patient pain with the same urgency as \"Code Blue\" life-threatening medical emergencies.\n\n\"We need training and tools that enable us to navigate--in a sensitive and compassionate manner--the sometimes difficult discussions in which we help patients and families cope with a poor prognosis, understand what is important to them, and focus on the things we can do to support these goals,\" researcher John You, M.D., associate professor of medicine at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada, told Medscape.\n\nEven with proper training, though, it can be difficult for clinicians to rise to the challenge of having an open discussion about death with their patients, Tim Ihrig, M.D., a palliative care physician at UnityPoint Health in Fort Dodge, Iowa, told NPR.\n\n\"We don't have the vernacular in our society to have the conversation about the end of life,\" he said. Therefore, \"a lot of practitioners aren't honest. We fail to empower patients with the truth.\"\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- access the Annals of Internal Medicine study\n\n- check out the JAMA study\n\n- read the NPR report\n\n- here's the Medscape article\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nDying in America: Healthcare leaders must bolster end-of-life care discussions, efforts\n\n5 important end-of-life topics to discuss with seriously ill patients\n\nHospitals make varied progress on end-of-life care\n\n'Code Comfort' treats pain, suffering with same urgency as Code Blue\n\nMassachusetts becomes first state to require end-of-life talks\n\nRoadmap guides end-of-life care discussions, decision-making\n\nWhat not to say when telling patients they are dying", "article_metadata": {"description": "Despite repeated\u00a0calls for improvement in end-of-life care and planning,\u00a0pain and suffering has actually increased for dying patients, and significant barriers still stand in the way of effective discussions about patients' care options, according to recent research", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "Despite repeated\u00a0calls for improvement in end-of-life care and planning,\u00a0pain and suffering has actually increased for dying patients, and significant barriers still stand in the way of effective discussions about patients' care options, according to recent research", "title": "End-of-life care, planning fails patients", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/end-life-care-planning-fails-patients/2015-02-05", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "Care Delivery,end of life care,end of life planning,palliative care,Patient Care & Outcomes,Patient Engagement,patient pain", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Care Delivery,Patient Care & Outcomes,Patient Engagement"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fceb50\"", "article_summary": "Despite repeated calls for improvement in end-of-life care and planning, pain and suffering has actually increased for dying patients, and significant barriers still stand in the way of effective discussions about patients' care options, according to recent research.\n\"We've put a lot of work into [improving end-of-life care] and it's not yielding what we thought it should be yielding.\nBased on the clinicians' observations, researchers found that discussions about end-of-life care are most often hampered by patients and their family members.\nIn an attempt to address this problem, Massachusetts recently became the first state to require physicians to offer end-of-life planning to patients, FiercePracticeManagement reported.\nThe most common reasons cited were: both patients and their families' difficulty accepting a poor prognosis, limited understanding of life-sustaining treatment options, disagreement among family members about care goals, and patients' inability to make decisions about their own care."}
