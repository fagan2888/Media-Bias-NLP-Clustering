He got to meet his five cubs.\n\nZoo officials gradually introduced Jabari back to the pride this week. After initially giving the cubs a thorough smell test, Jabari accepted them as his own. When playtime got too rough, mom Kashifa jumped in to make him back off.\n\nZoo officials aren't certain if Jabari is the cubs' father but say it's likely. He and his brother had access to Kashifa and her sister and both were observed breeding with them. Zoo officials said Jabari showed the greatest interest in the cubs so they decided to introduce them in hopes of creating a complete pride. This would be a first for Zoo Miami.\n\nThe public can meet the pride for the first time Sunday.\n\nCopyright 2014 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
