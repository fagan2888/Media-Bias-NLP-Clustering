It went up on I-69 outside of Flint, Michigan with no context. Just a blue billboard with most of a white circle and the words \u201cI\u2019m concerned about the blueberries\u201d in plain white text. What did it mean? Who put it up? Its sponsor remained anonymous and its message made no sense.\n\nOf course, that didn\u2019t stop people from speculating. Was it a reference to marijuana? A racist code? A condemnation of gum-chewing? In line with current events, was it a message in opposition to the Affordable Care Act? \u201cThis person has an affiliation with Blue Cross Blue Shield. That is all I will say,\u201d one woman said on Facebook.\n\nShe was wrong. After two weeks, the local businessman behind the billboard came forward. When most of us want to share cryptic wisdom with the world, we post on Facebook. Phil Shaltz bought a billboard, because he could.\n\nThe sentence itself came out of the mouth of a young tour guide he met on a recent tour of Alaska. The only real problem in the man\u2019s life, it seems, was that he was \u201cconcerned about the blueberries.\u201d There might not be enough rain, he explained.\n\nAt first, he judged the tour guide: all of the problems in the world, and in others\u2019 lives, and this kid is worried about wild blueberries? There isn\u2019t even anything he can do about it, since blueberries depend on rainfall.\n\nThen he gave it more thought and realized that everyone has \u201cblueberries.\u201d Your neighbor\u2019s insurmountable obstacle might be something you laugh off as a first world problem. That doesn\u2019t make it any less of a problem, or any easier for that person to solve.\n\nHe explained to Michigan Live:\n\nWe all go through the day and we see people who have blueberries \u2013 their own issues \u2013 and we don\u2019t do anything. Even when it\u2019s not about rain, when it\u2019s something we can impact, we show just how desensitized we\u2019ve become. We aren\u2019t as helpful to the common man in even the small things in life.\n\nWhat are the blueberries in your life? Is there anything that you worry about that can\u2019t be fixed? More importantly, does anyone you meet have a problem that they can\u2019t solve, but there\u2019s some way that you can help? Do it.\n\nOf course, all of that doesn\u2019t really fit on a billboard. A billboard that just says \u201cHey, help other people\u201d is boring.\n\nMystery solved: Man behind strange \u2018Blueberry Billboard\u2019 in Flint comes forward, explains meaning [MLive.com]", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "application-name": "Consumerist", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "Consumerist", "description": "\u201cI\u2019m concerned about the blueberries.\u201d That\u2019s what the billboard said.
