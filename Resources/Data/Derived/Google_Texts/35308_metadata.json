The contractor, Devau Human Resources, asked for an increase due to projected costs related to the Affordable Care Act, said Mark Eynatten, director of Chandler\u2019s Community Services Department.\n\n\u201cSince it was eligible for rebid, we put it back on the street,\u201d he said.\n\nThe terms of the contract Chandler is seeking would require the company to handle all parts of the hiring process of temporary or seasonal employees, Garcia said.\n\nCurrently, Chandler employees often interview, select and place temporary workers, Garcia said. The contractor then handles the payroll.\n\nThe new contract asks the company to take full control of the process so it is clear that the temp agency is the employer and not the city, Garcia said.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t want, I guess, liability or that misinterpretation of who the employer is and who would have to pay benefits,\u201d she said.\n\nUnder the Affordable Care Act, employers may be fined if they do not provide insurance to employees who work 30 or more hours per week. This requirement can include seasonal employees who work full time. Some temporary employees work 40-hour weeks for Chandler, Garcia said.\n\nWith this additional work being required, and the potential higher cost per employee due to the health-care requirements, Garcia said she expects the cost to the city to increase.\n\nTemporary hires typically work in the city\u2019s Community Services Department \u2014 lifeguards or recreation-class leaders, for example \u2014 but also handle administrative support or clerical positions, Garcia said.\n\nThe Community Services Department relies heavily on these temporary workers, but has finite funds allocated, Eynatten said.\n\n\u201cIf the cost of those positions are higher than what we currently are, that means we just have less money and means we\u2019ve got the ability to hire less people,\u201d he said. \u201cAs that comes in, we\u2019re going to have to take a long, hard look at how do we still meet the demand for service and the staff we need with the dollars we have available.\u201d\n\nNo decisions will be made until the bid amounts come in, he said.\n\nThe city\u2019s bid documents state that it is the contractor\u2019s responsibility to provide any required benefits, and that the company may not directly bill those costs to the city.\n\nThe company determines the wages of temporary workers, but the city has the opportunity to approve the rate.\n\nThe city will accept bids for this staffing contract until Wednesday, Jan. 22.", "article_metadata": {"byline": "Michelle Mitchell", "description": "Chandler seeking bids for new temporary employee staffing-agency,New rules for employers from the federal health-care law may make it more expensive for Chandler to hire temporary workers.", "pubdate": "Fri Jan 17, 2014 10:51 AM", "creditline": "The Republic  |  azcentral.com", "headline": "Chandler seeking bids for new temporary employee staffing-agency", "section": "Community", "og": {"url": "http://azc.cc/A2sn5", "type": "article", "image": "http://www.azcentral.com/imgs/azc_fb_logo.jpg", "site_name": "azcentral.com", "title": "Chandler seeking bids for new temporary employee staffing-agency"}, "fb": {"admins": 732445551, "app_id": 115142145268769}, "keywords": "Chandler seeking bids for new temporary employee staffing-agency, Arizona, News", "twitter": {"account_id": 13115682, "title": "Chandler seeking bids for new temporary employee staffing-agency", "url": "http://www.azcentral.com/community/chandler/articles/20140117chandler-seeking-bids-new-staffing-agency.html", "image": "http://www.azcentral.com/imgs/azc_fb_logo.jpg", "site": "@azcentral", "card": "summary", "description": "New rules for employers from the federal health-care law may make it more expensive for Chandler to hire temporary workers."}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe475f\"", "article_summary": "New rules for employers mandated in the federal health-care law could make it more expensive for Chandler to hire temporary workers, such as recreation-class leaders.\nCurrently, Chandler employees often interview, select and place temporary workers, Garcia said.\nThe city is seeking a new contract with a staffing agency to hire temporary employees and handle their payroll.\nSome temporary employees work 40-hour weeks for Chandler, Garcia said.\nThe company determines the wages of temporary workers, but the city has the opportunity to approve the rate."}
