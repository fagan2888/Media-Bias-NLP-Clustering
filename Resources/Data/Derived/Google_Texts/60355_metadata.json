One study suggests this technology can negatively affect childhood brain development. But four-year-old Camden Vaughan has proven that a basic understanding of how smartphones work is not only beneficial, but it\u2019s potentially life-saving.\n\nUSA Today recently shared the heartwarming story of how Camden unlocked his mother Misty\u2019s smartphone to call his dad, Dr. Jeremy Vaughan, after he found her passed out on the floor. Misty thought she had the flu, but her temperature kept rising. The last thing she remembers before waking up in the hospital is the 105 reading on her thermometer.\n\nOnce Camden unlocked the phone, he found his dad\u2019s picture at the top of the favorites list. \"He said, 'Daddy I need you to come home! Mommy can't get in the bath because she can't wake up,'\" Dr. Vaughan, who specializes in obstetrics & gynecology at Cedar Hill Women\u2019s Center in Texas, said of his son's call. \"And I said: 'I'm on my way!'\"\n\nMisty was taken to the Methodist Charlton Medical Center in Dallas, where her physician Dr. Ousama Moammar declared she had a seizure. Camden\u2019s call \u201csaved her life,\u201d he said. \u201cActing early and fast is of the essence.\u201d\n\nNow, Camden is anxious to leave his mom\u2019s hospital room and go back home. Misty, on the other hand, is reportedly doing well and thankful for how quick her family acted.\n\n\u201cIt could have been a matter of minutes,\u201d Misty said. \u201cIf my brain had continued at that temperate, I could not be the same or not be here at all.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "camden, vaughan, 4, saves, his, moms, life, simple, phone, call, dad", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Misty Vaughan says she might not be here today if her son Camden didn't call Dad when he did.", "title": "This 4-Year-Old Boy's Phone Call Saves Mom's Life", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/camden-vaughan-mom-phone-call-save-life-381260", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured_video/public/2016/04/09/camden-vaughan-4-saves-his-moms-life-simple-phone-call-dad.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Misty Vaughan says she might not be here today if her son Camden didn't call Dad when he did.", "title": "This 4-Year-Old Boy's Phone Call Saves Mom's Life", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/camden-vaughan-mom-phone-call-save-life-381260", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured_video/public/2016/04/09/camden-vaughan-4-saves-his-moms-life-simple-phone-call-dad.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2016/04/09/camden-vaughan-4-saves-his-moms-life-simple-phone-call-dad.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2016-04-09T16:38:51-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-09T16:44:33-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Misty Vaughan says she might not be here today if her son Camden didn't call Dad when he did."}, "article_summary": "But four-year-old Camden Vaughan has proven that a basic understanding of how smartphones work is not only beneficial, but it\u2019s potentially life-saving.\n\u201cActing early and fast is of the essence.\u201dNow, Camden is anxious to leave his mom\u2019s hospital room and go back home.\nOnce Camden unlocked the phone, he found his dad\u2019s picture at the top of the favorites list.\nUSA Today recently shared the heartwarming story of how Camden unlocked his mother Misty\u2019s smartphone to call his dad, Dr. Jeremy Vaughan, after he found her passed out on the floor.\nIt\u2019s not often you hear good things about a toddler who knows how to use mom\u2019s or dad\u2019s smart device."}
