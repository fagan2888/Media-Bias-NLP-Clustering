The lawsuit is to be filed in Iowa.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act requires all employers \u2013 religious or not \u2013 to provide employees with free contraceptive coverage, including the morning-after pill and sterilization. Cornerstone's insurance provider currently does not offer the morning-after pill.\n\nFederal rules finalized in June don\u2019t require religious colleges to \u201cpay for or promote access to employees\u2019 or students\u2019 birth control coverage,\u201d according to a story from Inside Higher Ed.\n\nBut employees and students at religious schools will still be able to \u201cget birth control fully covered by insurance with no co-pay, because insurance companies or third-party administrators will be required to pay for that coverage separately,\u201d the story said.\n\nCornerstone is represented in the lawsuit by Alliance Defending Freedom, an Arizona-based Christian legal-advocacy group. The university says Alliance \u201cwill bear all of the legal costs related to this litigation.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf the government can force Christian colleges like these to act contrary to their own deeply-held religious convictions, then the government can do just about anything,\u201d Gregory Baylor, senior counsel at Alliance, said in Cornerstone\u2019s letter announcing the lawsuit. \u201cThe government should not coerce any American in this manner.\u201d\n\nA question and answer sheet describing Cornerstone\u2019s lawsuit said other religious colleges have also filed lawsuits over the birth control mandate. Among them: Wheaton College, University of Notre Dame, Geneva College.\n\nIn his letter, Stowell wrote that the birth control provision in the Affordable Care Act is an example of the government infringing on Cornerstone\u2019s beliefs.\n\n\u201cIn our view, the government should not be able to force us to buy or provide insurance that gives access to objectionable drugs, devices and services that violate our institutional convictions.\"\n\nEmail Brian McVicar and follow him on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "Description": "Cornerstone University is suing the federal government over a provision of the Affordable Care Act that requires employers with health insurance plans to provide birth control, according to a letter from university President Joseph Stowell.", "title": "Cornerstone University suing federal government over birth control mandate in Affordable Care Act", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Cornerstone University suing federal government over birth control mandate in Affordable Care Act\", \"link\": \"http://www.mlive.com/news/grand-rapids/index.ssf/2013/10/cornerstone_university_suing_f.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://imgick.mlive.com/home/mlive-media/width620/img/grpress/news_impact/photo/13637121-standard.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"11493726\", \"pub_date\": \"2013-10-24T14:07:05Z\", \"author\": \"Brian McVicar | bmcvicar@mlive.com\", \"tags\": [\"@gr-news\",\"@gr-river\",\"@mlive-education\",\"@mlive-river\"] }", "twitter": {"image": "http://media.mlive.com/grpress/news_impact/photo/13637121-thumb_square_large.jpg", "creator": "@GRMcVicar", "site": "@mlive", "card": "summary", "description": "Cornerstone University is suing the federal government over a provision of the Affordable Care Act that requires employers with health insurance plans to provide birth control, according to a letter from university President Joseph Stowell."}, "article_date_updated": "Thursday, October 24, 2013, 12:46 PM", "parsely-metadata": "{\"image_url\": \"http://media.mlive.com/grpress/news_impact/photo/cornerstone102413jpg-ff2621d137045f60.jpg\", \"author_name\": \"brianmcvicar\", \"author_nickname\": \"Brian McVicar | bmcvicar@mlive.com\", \"author_id\": \"8206984\", \"source_blog_name\": \"Grand Rapids News\", \"source_blog_url\": \"http://www.mlive.com/news/grand-rapids/index.ssf/\", \"sponsored_content\": \"0\" }", "og": {"site_name": "MLive.com", "description": "Cornerstone University is suing the federal government over a provision of the Affordable Care Act that requires employers with health insurance plans to provide birth control, according to a letter from university President Joseph Stowell.", "title": "Cornerstone University suing federal government over birth control mandate in Affordable Care Act", "url": "http://www.mlive.com/news/grand-rapids/index.ssf/2013/10/cornerstone_university_suing_f.html", "image": "http://media.mlive.com/design/alpha/img/logo_mlive.gif", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "MLive.com", "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Thursday, October 24, 2013, 10:06 AM", "article_author": "Brian McVicar | bmcvicar@mlive.com"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1e78\"", "article_summary": "GRAND RAPIDS, MI - Cornerstone University is suing the federal government over a provision of the Affordable Care Act that requires employers with health insurance plans to provide birth control, according to a letter from university President Joseph Stowell.\nIn his letter, Stowell wrote that the birth control provision in the Affordable Care Act is an example of the government infringing on Cornerstone\u2019s beliefs.\n\u201cThe government should not coerce any American in this manner.\u201dA question and answer sheet describing Cornerstone\u2019s lawsuit said other religious colleges have also filed lawsuits over the birth control mandate.\nCornerstone's insurance provider currently does not offer the morning-after pill.\nFederal rules finalized in June don\u2019t require religious colleges to \u201cpay for or promote access to employees\u2019 or students\u2019 birth control coverage,\u201d according to a story from Inside Higher Ed."}
