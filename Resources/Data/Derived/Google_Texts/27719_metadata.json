The wife of presidential hopeful and U.S. senator from Texas, Ted Cruz, spoke about her husband\u2019s campaign during and after her speech at the Midland County Republican Women\u2019s luncheon on Wednesday at Midland Country Club.\n\n\u201cWhat Ted is speaking to is letting everyone run their own race and that we should stay on the messages that matter to people,\u201d Cruz said about her husband\u2019s public pledge of not criticizing the other Republican candidates. \u201cThere are 17 candidates. Ted is going to run his race, and as he does so he is not going to speak ill of any candidate. I think the reason he\u2019s doing that is, he wants the voters to decide.\u201d\n\nCruz said that in the event her husband wins the election, he would look at \u201cany of his colleagues on stage\u201d as a potential member of his administration.\n\nThe crowd of at least 150 people warmly received Cruz, who interwove stories about her childhood and the couple\u2019s two daughters with information about the senator\u2019s campaign and policies.\n\nCruz listed three main principles of her husband\u2019s campaign: job growth and opportunity, defending constitutional liberties and restoring the nation\u2019s leadership on an international level.\n\n\u201cWhat Ted is running on is your values -- West Texas values,\u201d Cruz said.\n\nShe received a round of applause when she listed abolishing the IRS as a goal, and said that repealing Obamacare -- which she and her family are now on -- is a top priority as well.\n\n\u201cWe do need health care reform, but a system that increased people\u2019s premiums and distorts free-market economics and has caused five major insurance companies to merge into three is not the way to go,\u201d Cruz said.\n\nShe also spoke about the campaign\u2019s recent rallies that have attracted thousands of people and admitted she was \u201cshocked\u201d when she found out many of them were members of other political parties. She listed her husband\u2019s \u201cconsistent conservatism\u201d on all issues as the reason that he has appeal across party lines.\n\n\u201cWhen voters know what their candidate stands for, they\u2019re willing to vote for them on the issues, not because of the party that they\u2019re part of,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cThat\u2019s how you get over crossover votes because they become issue voters. That\u2019s where people come out and say \u2026 I am voting because of X not because of (the candidate\u2019s) party.\u201d\n\nFollowing her speech, Cruz answered questions from the audience and the media. One question posed by a member of the MCRW was, \u201cWhat will you do as first lady?\u201d\n\n\u201cMy interests are really on the economic side, and there is such a need for raising the standard of living for those at the bottom of the economic ladder in this country,\u201d said Cruz, who served in the White House as the economic director for the Western Hemisphere at the National Security Council, among other positions. \u201cI think you have to get into the education system when you start talking about giving kids a chance in the economic world, so we would focus on school choice as well.\u201d\n\nState Rep. Tom Craddick also spoke at the luncheon, reviewing laws passed by the House as well as those that stalled. He congratulated Midland City Council members on their success in passing the texting-while-driving ban, and acknowledged Mayor Jerry Morales and J.Ross Lacy, who were at the luncheon.\n\n\u201cYou succeeded where I couldn\u2019t,\u201d said Craddick, who sponsored and introduced House Bill 80 that would have effectively banned texting while driving statewide.\n\nFollow Cassie on Twitter at @Cassie_Burton51 or on Facebook at /CassieBurton15\n\n# # #", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "MRT.com", "description": "In a speech in Midland, Ted Cruz's wife\u00a0\u00a0listed three main principles of his campaign: job growth and opportunity, defending constitutional liberties and restoring the nation\u2019s leadership on an international level.", "title": "Heidi Cruz: Husband is attracting 'crossover votes'", "url": "http://www.mrt.com/news/politics/article_7874df8c-4156-11e5-ad9d-dfcff8a0360c.html", "image": {"width": 469, "identifier": "http://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/mrt.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/5/f7/5f7a3eb9-d4eb-5c12-85d8-d10159d0c3b5/55cb9812bf21c.image.jpg?resize=469%2C630", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary"}, "description": "In a speech in Midland, Ted Cruz's wife\u00a0\u00a0listed three main principles of his campaign: job growth and opportunity, defending constitutional liberties and restoring the nation\u2019s leadership on an international level.", "alexaVerifyID": "A6ceEFS0S5jDksnNeroDWYv-Ng8", "msvalidate.01": "413490AB8B4C8646430571E6A42CDACD", "fb": {"admins": 683724462, "page_id": 361381078011, "app_id": 361381078011}, "google-site-verification": "xNnVfsZTVBWcZfJ0g8VA3xLs604yxyfE-XDF2qcsuS8", "keywords": "Midland,news, A6ceEFS0S5jDksnNeroDWYv-Ng8", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheReporterTelegram"}, "y_key": "b7ecaaeb522529c1", "news_keywords": "republican party united states,jeb bush,1600 pennsylvania avenue tv series,administrator of the environmental protection agency,administrator of the small business administration,associated press,ben carson,billionaire,ted cruz,donald trump,heidi cruz,politics,senator,texas,presidential hopeful,united states,midland country club,midland county,tom craddick,west texas,internal revenue service,insurance,mcrw,first lady,economic director,national security council,white house,director for the western hemisphere,j.ross lacy,midland city council,mayor,jerry morales,facebook,politics,local,state_and_national,top_stories"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb47c\"", "article_summary": "Cruz listed three main principles of her husband\u2019s campaign: job growth and opportunity, defending constitutional liberties and restoring the nation\u2019s leadership on an international level.\nThe wife of presidential hopeful and U.S. senator from Texas, Ted Cruz, spoke about her husband\u2019s campaign during and after her speech at the Midland County Republican Women\u2019s luncheon on Wednesday at Midland Country Club.\nHeidi Cruz said she doesn\u2019t think so.\nShe listed her husband\u2019s \u201cconsistent conservatism\u201d on all issues as the reason that he has appeal across party lines.\n\u201cThat\u2019s how you get over crossover votes because they become issue voters."}
