Our veterans bravely put their lives on the line for us and we are proud to partner with Health Net to ensure their health care needs continue to be met through increased convenience and access to care.\u201d\n\nHealth Net has made Centura Health, including its 600 employed primary care physicians and specialists of Centura Health Physician Group in Colorado and Kansas, a major network provider for VA\u2019s PC3 and Veterans Choice programs.\n\nPC3 allows veterans to receive care in their local communities when local VA medical centers cannot readily provide the needed care to veterans due to geographic inaccessibility or limited capacity. Under PC3, eligible veterans with an approved VA authorization have access to community-based primary care, inpatient specialty care, outpatient specialty care, mental health care, limited emergency care and limited newborn care for female veterans following the birth of a child.\n\nThe Veterans Choice program was created by the Veterans Access, Choice and Accountability Act of 2014 (VACAA) and allows eligible veterans who live more than 40 miles from a VA facility or are unable to get a VA appointment within 30 days of their preferred date, or within 30 days of the date determined medically necessary by their physician, to obtain approved care in their community instead.\n\nAbout Centura Health\n\nCentura Health connects individuals, families and neighborhoods across Colorado and western Kansas with more than 6,000 physicians and 18,100 of the best hearts and minds in health care. Through our 15 hospitals, six senior living communities, health neighborhoods, physician practices and clinics, home care and hospice services, and Flight For Life\u00ae Colorado, we are making the region\u2019s best health care accessible and affordable in every community we serve.
