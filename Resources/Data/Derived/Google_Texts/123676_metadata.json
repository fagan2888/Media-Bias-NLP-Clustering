There are thousands more ICD-10 billing codes as compared to the old ICD-9 system \u2014 the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention lists over 140,000 codes between procedures and diagnosis, compared to less than 18,000 under ICD-9.\n\nThe ICD system is effectively the worldwide common language for reporting and monitoring diseases, and the U.S. is lagging behind much of the world in adopting ICD-10. Part of the reason why health care providers are dragging their feet with implementation is that while the codes are useful on the back end of care for analysis and identifying potential improvements and cost reductions, they are a royal pain for the providers.\n\nYou may have had a good laugh at several articles compiling bizarre ICD-10 codes from which physicians have to choose. It is hard not to laugh at \u201cstruck by an Orca,\u201d \u201csucked into a jet engine,\u201d and our personal favorite, \u201cburn due to water skis on fire.\u201d Perhaps ICD-11 will have a code that covers \u201cstruck by a flaming Orca on water skis wearing a jet engine\u201d!\n\nIt\u2019s all very funny \u2014 until your doctor cannot find the best code description to cover your visit and the insurance company refuses to pay. The Workgroup for Electronic Data Interchange (WEDI) announced in August that, according to its readiness survey, approximately 25 percent of doctors would not be ready for the transition and another 25 percent were not sure they would be ready in time. Thus, up to half of America\u2019s doctors may not be able to find the right code for your visit.\n\nWho can blame them? Let\u2019s take the example of an injury, which requires four different codes.\n\nInjury \u2014 Information includes side of body, body part, whether it is the first visit or follow-up visit for that injury, or whether it is a subsequent injury caused by the first one, such as an infected wound. Note that \u201cinitial encounter\u201d and \u201csubsequent encounter\u201d refer to seeing the doctor, not the injury. \u201cWalked into lamppost, subsequent encounter\u201d does not mean you ran into a lamppost twice.\n\nWhere did the injury take place \u2014 Seemingly straightforward, but not necessarily so. For example, in some codes you can find \u201cbodies of water\u201d but not \u201clake.\u201d Phrasing is important, yet not obvious. The process can be frustratingly time consuming if you are a doctor already running behind on appointments, and patients are not likely to be sympathetic as to why you are running late.\n\nWhat activity was taking place \u2014 Imagine how many ways this can be parsed. It\u2019s easy to defer to \u201cother\u201d only to find an obscure code exists for that activity \u2014 such as Orca training.\n\nStatus \u2014 Are you a student, worker, volunteer, Orca Trainer\u2026 you get the idea.\n\nIt is not straightforward, nor is it easily searchable \u2014 in fact, it isn\u2019t searchable at all as of this writing, at least in the sense of \u201csearchable\u201d we associate today with computer databases. Doctors may only have a huge reference book to use, with smaller \u201ccheat sheets\u201d for more common codes. It will take time for doctors to get used to the new codes and erroneous coding could have serious manifestations. Patients could end up being billed for services that are actually covered by insurance, and insurance may deny claims that are improperly coded.\n\nExpect delays during the transition period, and be prepared for a battle with doctors and insurance companies as you deal with improperly coded services.\n\nAs a side note for ObamaCare haters, ICD-10 cannot be blamed on the Affordable Care Act (ACA). The ICD is an effort of the World Health Organization and not directly related to the ACA. Obviously, ObamaCare will use ICD-10 information \u2014 as will any healthcare and insurance system we use.\n\nDon\u2019t like ICD-10? All you have to do is wait until 2018, when ICD-11 rolls out to accommodate electronic medical records and other information systems. That will certainly make things smoother\u2026 won\u2019t it?\n\nRelated stories:\n\nMoneytips.com is a website that answers people\u2019s money-related questions, publishes guides explaining products and services available in the marketplace, provides calculators to help people plan and budget, and produces related content.", "article_metadata": {"description": "It\u2019s all very funny \u2014 until your doctor cannot find the best code description to cover your visit and the insurance company refuses to pay.
