It turns out the former commissioner\u2019s computer crashed 16 days before she learned of IRS targeting.\n\nIf I were the Republican Party, rather than attacking Lois Lerner as a modern-day E. Howard Hunt, I\u2019d hire her as an election consultant. Why? Because the former commissioner at the center of the \u201cnewly re-burgeoning\u201d IRS \u201cscandal\u201d is clearly a clairvoyant. I should think she\u2019d be pretty handy for Reince Priebus to have around this October. You see, she can see things 16 days before they happen.\n\nHow do I know this? Consider the timeline of events. Lerner, who worked in the service\u2019s Washington office, was first alerted that employees in the Cincinnati branch were using \u201cinappropriate criteria\u201d (key words like \u201ctea party\u201d) to process the applications of nonprofit groups on June 29, 2011. This comes from the very Treasury Department IG report that first made this whole business public. See the timeline here.\n\n\n\nOK, so that\u2019s that. Now, you\u2019ve been hearing all this stuff lately about her lost emails, right? Her emails from between January 2009 and April 2011 disappeared. Went poof. It was in early 2010 that the IRS began using the inappropriate criteria. Looks awfully suspicious, doesn\u2019t it? She lost all her emails pertaining to the period under examination and then some. Stinks to high heaven. Some have compared the missing two-plus years to the famous 18 1/2-minute gap in the Watergate tapes.\n\nOne problem. Her computer crashed on June 13, 2011. It was the following day that she wrote to other IRS personnel to tell them: \u201cMy computer crashed yesterday.\u201d This date was noted last week by Sander Levin, the ranking Democrat on the House Ways and Means Committee.\n\nThat was when all those emails disappeared on her. It happened 16 days before she even knew about the problem in the Cincinnati office. So how likely is it that she deleted those emails in order to prevent House investigators from being able to learn anything about the \u201cscandal\u201d? Considering that she didn\u2019t know about the problem yet, I\u2019d say bloody unlikely.\n\nIn other words, this is just another ridiculous allegation in a parade of them. Admittedly, all of these revelations have looked dubious at first glance. But all of them have fizzled upon serious examination. It wasn\u2019t just groups on the right that were targeted. The IRS head who visited the White House 155 times or whatever it was turns out to have gone to the Old Executive Office Building, not the White House, most of those times, and largely to talk about the IRS\u2019 role in crafting and implementing Obamacare. And so on.\n\nOn top of that, the idea that Obama himself had some hand in this stuff, which was of course the original suspicion and orgasmatronic dream in Wingnuttia, is and always has been utterly crazy. I wouldn\u2019t have put much past George W. Bush, but I would never have believed that even he would have orchestrated a scandal with such little upside (keeping some groups from getting 501c3 status) and such massive downside (possible Nixonian illegality). Dick Cheney, maybe, but not Bush.\n\nAnd on top of that, the extremely unsurprising fact is that federal government computers crash all the time. These agencies\u2019 internal operations are all underfunded, and bureaucrats all over the country are using primitive computers that groan under the weight of today\u2019s demands. Plus, requirements for data preservation are fairly lax\u2014and even if they weren\u2019t, problems happen in this realm frequently.\n\nRemember the Bush-era U.S. attorney firings? The Bush White House announced that it had lost 5 million emails during that probe. Not all emails relating to the Valerie Plame investigation were properly preserved. And finally, a Justice Department report found that many emails written by and to two Bush administration officials who\u2019d been involved in crafting the \u201ctorture is legal\u201d argument had suddenly gone missing. I\u2019m sure the people today saying that the IRS scandal is bigger than Watergate were making excuses then.\n\nIn this case, no excuses need to be made. Unless Lois Lerner is a clairvoyant, the idea that she deleted emails on June 13 to cover up behavior she didn\u2019t even learn about until June 29 is simply preposterous to any rational person with even a passing respect for facts and evidence. Unfortunately, that doesn\u2019t describe Darrell Issa, who is holding another hearing Monday night (yes, night!), casting his fishing line out into the sea one more time. His colleague Trey Gowdy is going to be getting all the Benghazi headlines once that committee is up and running, so Issa has to find something to do, I suppose.\n\nWhat\u2019s amusing to me here is this: Conservatives are the people who think government can\u2019t do anything right. That is exactly the situation we have here. IRS employees in Cincinnati really screwed up the processing of applications. The people in the charge of them in Washington were to some degree asleep. Computers crashed and emails were lost. As far as conservatives are concerned, that\u2019s what government does all the time.", "article_metadata": {"twitter": {"site": "@thedailybeast", "card": "summary", "creator": "mtomasky"}, "keywords": "u.s. poli", "publicationDate": 201406230945, "wrap": "/content/dailybeast/politics", "description": "Remember those two years of missing emails the Republicans were going on about?
