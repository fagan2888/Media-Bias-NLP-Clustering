But it\u2019s probably safe to assume that there are a lot of people \u2014 mostly guys \u2014 who consume porn in this country and globally.\n\nHowever, porn habits are not something many people want to admit, possibly because of its stigma. It\u2019s gross, it\u2019s wrong, it\u2019s degrading to women \u2014 the list goes on. New research conducted by the Public Religion Research Institute shows that in fact, more Americans believe that porn is morally wrong than expected.\n\nOnly 29 percent of Americans think that watching porn is \u201cmorally acceptable,\u201d the study found. There's also a relatively large gender gap: 23 percent of women approve, while about 35 percent of men believe it\u2019s morally alright. This means that 65 percent of men think porn is morally wrong. That's right, the majority of men disapprove of porn. This is surprising, seeing as if you\u2019re a male, it\u2019s very likely that you watch porn, or have watched it in the past.\n\nAre men simply not admitting to their habits, or do they hold moral beliefs that they don\u2019t act upon (and then feel guilty about it, hence the lack of revealing their true habits)? It\u2019s difficult to say, but what the study made clear is the difference between people\u2019s personal moral beliefs and their viewpoints on legal matters. For example, 39 percent of the participants said they\u2019d be opposed to legal restrictions on pornography, even though 10 percent of those believe porn is morally wrong.\n\nEven though the majority of Americans disapprove of porn, they are still consuming it \u2013 whether or not it\u2019s a guilty pleasure. According to a Pew Research Center survey, about 12 percent of poll participants, who were frequent online video viewers, watched pornography \u2013 25 percent of males did, while only eight percent of females admitted to it. However, the report adds that \u201cthis may reflect a reluctance to report the behavior among some adults.\u201d\n\nHowever, a 2008 study on college campuses found that 87 percent of \"emerging\" adult men, between the ages of 18 and 26, and 31 percent of emerging adult women, had reported watching porn at some point. The same study found that 20 percent of young males watched porn every day or every other day.\n\nWhat this means is that people\u2019s moral beliefs may not always match up with their actions. And it also appears that people have become more willing to accept the right to watch porn, produce porn \u2014 and also to star in porn \u2014 if they so desire.\n\n'Pro-Porn Feminists'\n\nAmong the new generation, pro-porn feminists are now emerging \u2014 girls who watch, or participate in porn themselves, and wholly embrace it as their own choice. Take Bell Knox for example: A 19-year-old Duke University student who started starring in porn flicks to help pay her college tuition. Belle Knox, who hasn\u2019t revealed her real name, made a major media splash when a classmate exposed her porn activity; since then, she\u2019s been writing on feminist blogs and defending her right to have autonomy over her body as a porn starlet. She says she plans on being a lawyer and is currently studying Women\u2019s Studies.\n\nPerhaps watching porn isn\u2019t right or wrong, but it depends on whether porn stars do it based on their own free choices and for their own reasons. Belle Knox told The New York Daily News that she believes \u201c80 percent of the world\u2019s traffic on the Internet is pornography. And I think that probably every single person at some point in their life has watched pornography. So, I think it\u2019s extremely hypocritical that the same society that consumes me is also condemning me.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "watching porn, porn morality, belle knox, porn a guilty pleasure, watching porn and morality", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "A new study finds that 79 percent of Americans don't morally approve of porn, but a good number of them probably still watch it.", "title": "Why Americans Think Porn Is Wrong, But Still Watch It", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/morality-porn-why-americans-think-its-wrong-still-watch-it-270790", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/03/08/old-people-accidentally-seeing-porn.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A new study finds that 79 percent of Americans don't morally approve of porn, but a good number of them probably still watch it.", "title": "Why Americans Think Porn Is Wrong, But Still Watch It", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/morality-porn-why-americans-think-its-wrong-still-watch-it-270790", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/03/08/old-people-accidentally-seeing-porn.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/03/08/old-people-accidentally-seeing-porn.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2014-03-08T14:04:29-05:00", "modified_time": "2014-03-08T14:04:28-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "A new study finds that 79 percent of Americans don't morally approve of porn, but a good number of them probably still watch it."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd94b1\"", "article_summary": "This means that 65 percent of men think porn is morally wrong.\nNew research conducted by the Public Religion Research Institute shows that in fact, more Americans believe that porn is morally wrong than expected.\nOnly 29 percent of Americans think that watching porn is \u201cmorally acceptable,\u201d the study found.\nIt's difficult to pinpoint exact numbers on watching porn in the U.S., because it\u2019s often something that happens behind closed doors.\nAnd I think that probably every single person at some point in their life has watched pornography."}
