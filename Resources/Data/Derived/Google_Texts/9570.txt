Rep. James P. McGovern, a Massachusetts Democrat and one of the president’s most reliable allies in Congress, said Sunday he can’t support Mr. Obama’s call for authorization of a military strike on Syria.

“Look, I’m a big supporter of Barack Obama,” Mr. McGovern said in an appearance on CNN’s “State of the Union.” “I support him on almost everything, but sometimes friends can disagree. This is not a question about party loyalty; this is a question about what is right.”

Mr. McGovern said the president should rally the international community to bring pressure to bear on Syrian President Bashir Assad.

“We’re being told that there’s two choices: Do nothing or bomb Syria. Clearly there have to be some other choice in between. We ought to explore them,” he said.
