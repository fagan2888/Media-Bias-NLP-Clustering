He was trying to shake up the offense.\n\nDon Zimmer picked his lineup out of a hat too, as boss of the Boston Red Sox in the late 1970s. But \u201cseven of eight came out in the same place they batted in the day before. That\u2019s how bad I was going,\u201d Zimmer once said.\n\nSo Rockies manager Walt Weiss has precedent if he wants to use that willy-nilly method against Dodgers ace Clayton Kershaw in Los Angeles on Monday night.\n\n\u201cA right-handed lineup against lefties hasn\u2019t really worked,\u201d Weiss said Sunday. \u201cI may pick it out of a hat tomorrow.\u201d\n\nRockies hitters have struggled against southpaws, losing Saturday night to Seattle Mariners lefty Roenis Elias. The Rockies are 6-26 against left-handers this season.\n\nSunday, against Seattle lefty starter James Paxton, Weiss used a slew of lefty hitters, abandoning a traditional right-left advantage. He used Carlos Gonzalez, Charlie Blackmon and Justin Morneau.\n\nBut Kershaw is the most effective lefty of them all. And Weiss said he likely will look for any right-left boost he can find.\n\nAnd, even if Martin and Zimmer tried the hat method, Weiss probably won\u2019t go there.\n\n\u201cYou do that today and you\u2019d get buried,\u201d he said.\n\nMemorable moment. Catcher Tom Murphy made his major-league debut with the Rockies on Saturday night after a sudden call-up to replace veteran Nick Hundley.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s something I\u2019ll never forget, that\u2019s for sure,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t really hit you until that one big moment in the game. That was in the first inning, when we went 1-2-3. And I came back to the dugout and I was like, \u2018Dang, that just really happened.\u2019 \u201c\n\nWith Hundley (neck injury) and Michael McKenry (knee surgery) out for the season, the Rockies have a mostly rookie catcher complement between Murphy, Dustin Garneau (who started Sunday) and Wilin Rosario (a first baseman/pinch hitter most of the time).\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not how you draw it up,\u201d Weiss said. \u201cBut both (rookies) are cerebral and mentally strong. That helps a lot.\u201d\n\nAdames contributing. Rookie shortstop Cristhian Adames, who bunted Sunday to help score a run, is 9-for-21 since his call-up Sept. 1. He made his debut last season, but he looks much different this year, Weiss said.\n\n\u201cThe game looked fast for him at times (last year),\u201d Weiss said. \u201cHe looks very at ease on a major-league field now. I see a tremendous amount of growth in a short amount of time.\u201d\n\nAdames was helped by playing winter ball in the Dominican League for Toros del Este, where he won a batting title late last year. His fielding, though, is impressing his manager.\n\n\u201cI always liked his actions,\u201d Weiss said. \u201cWhen he got around the ball, his feet and his hands worked really well. That hasn\u2019t changed.\u201d\n\nFootnote. Shortstop Jose Reyes sat for a third consecutive game with a sore left hamstring. \u201cHe had an ankle injury that was pretty serious\u201d with Toronto earlier this season, Weiss said. \u201cI\u2019m going to be especially cautious because of that history there.\u201d\n\nRockies\u2019 Jon Gray (0-0, 5.17 ERA) at Dodgers\u2019 Clayton Kershaw (13-6, 2.15), 8:10 p.m. Monday, ROOT; 850 AM\n\nIn 30 starts against the Rockies, Kershaw has been dominant. He is 16-5 with a 3.27 ERA. The Rockies are hitting just .223 against him all time. He has 212 strikeouts against Colorado, second most of any team behind only the Giants. Gray, on the flipside, is looking for his first career victory. He\u2019s just the second pitcher since at least 1914 to start a career with seven no-decisions. And the Rockies are just 1-6 behind him. His start Monday will be his first against the Dodgers.\n\nTuesday: Rockies\u2019 Chris Rusin (5-8, 5.14 ERA) at Dodgers\u2019 Brett Anderson (9-8, 3.36), 8:10 p.m., ROOT\n\nWednesday: Rockies\u2019 Jorge De La Rosa (9-6, 4.28) at Dodgers\u2019 Alex Wood (10-9, 3.67), 8:10 p.m., ROOT\n\nThursday: Off\n\nFriday: Padres\u2019 Ian Kennedy (8-14, 4.28) at Rockies Chad Bettis (7-5, 4.59), 6:40 p.m., ROOT", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Rockies\u2019 manager Walt Weiss unsure of lineup against Clayton Kershaw", "title": "Rockies\u2019 manager Walt Weiss unsure of lineup against Clayton Kershaw", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/09/13/rockies-manager-walt-weiss-unsure-of-lineup-against-clayton-kershaw/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150913__kershawp1-1.jpg", "height": 454}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150913__kershawp1-1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-09-13T21:32:34+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-21T18:41:51+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "So Rockies manager Walt Weiss has precedent if he wants to use that willy-nilly method against Dodgers ace Clayton Kershaw in Los Angeles on Monday night.\nSunday, against Seattle lefty starter James Paxton, Weiss used a slew of lefty hitters, abandoning a traditional right-left advantage.\n\u201cHe had an ankle injury that was pretty serious\u201d with Toronto earlier this season, Weiss said.\n\u201cI\u2019m going to be especially cautious because of that history there.\u201dRockies\u2019 Jon Gray (0-0, 5.17 ERA) at Dodgers\u2019 Clayton Kershaw (13-6, 2.15), 8:10 p.m. Monday, ROOT; 850 AMIn 30 starts against the Rockies, Kershaw has been dominant.\n\u201cA right-handed lineup against lefties hasn\u2019t really worked,\u201d Weiss said Sunday."}
