In reference to the United States, the 2011 report of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons states, \u201cSince the beginning of destruction activities, the OPCW has verified the destruction of \u2026 89.71% of the declared stockpile.\u201d That\u2019s a high percentage, but it is not 100 percent, and the United States had one of the larger stockpiles in the world. The U.S. government can set a better example than that. (As if it needed any chemical weapons. Besides its nuclear arsenal, the U.S. military has the world\u2019s most destructive arsenal of \u201cconventional\u201d weapons\u2014so powerful that it erases the line between such weapons and most \u201cweapons of mass destruction.\u201d)\n\nBesides destroying its own arsenal, the United States should go even further in showing good faith by publicly telling its closest Middle East allies, Egypt and Israel, to ratify the CWC and destroy their chemical arsenals. The governments of these countries get billions of dollars in military aid each year from American taxpayers and routinely use military force against innocent people. It is outrageous for the U.S. government to make high and mighty pronouncements about chemical weapons with regard to Syria while winking its eye at Israel (which also has biological and nuclear weapons) and Egypt.\n\nThe Obama administration\u2019s selective demands about chemical weapons ought to be judged in light of this overlooked bit of history: According to Stephen Zunes, a Middle East scholar at the University of San Francisco, \u201cSyria has joined virtually all other Arab states in calling for \u2026 a \u2018weapons of mass destruction-free zone\u2019 for the entire Middle East. In December 2003, Syria introduced a UN Security Council resolution reiterating this clause from 12 years earlier, but the resolution was tabled as a result of a threatened U.S. veto.\u201d (Emphasis added.)\n\nWhy would the United States have vetoed the resolution? Because ally Israel refuses to acknowledge, much less give up, its WMD arsenal. So much for a weapons-of-mass-destruction-free Middle East.\n\nHad that resolution been adopted, Syria would not have chemical weapons today.\n\nThe CWC has no built-in enforcement provision, but the International Criminal Court in The Hague could be used to prosecute war criminals. However, as Matt Welch points out, \u201cmostly because of lobbying efforts from the United States[,] the ICC cannot go after dictators that do not recognize the court\u2019s legitimacy. Prosecutions of rogue actors must be referred to the ICC by the United Nations Security Council.\u2026 The only time residents of non-signatory countries like Syria \u2014 or the United States \u2014 can be hauled in is at the request of the UN Security Council.\u2026 Assad might have been charged already had it not been for American diplomatic resistance to a more aggressive court.\u201d\n\nMoreover, Gavin de Becker writes that the United States\u2014the exceptional and indispensable nation\u2014has managed to exempt itself from some international rules concerning warfare: \u201cAs happens with many contracts, countries sign the conventions only after adding their reservations and objections, composed by lawyers who write in cozy offices. One quickly sees that the treaties are not quite so lofty as many imagine.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s something else the U.S. government could do: ratify the 2008 Convention on Cluster Munitions, which bans cluster bombs, those nasty weapons that can spread hundreds of unexploded bomblets that are capable of indiscriminately killing innocent children and adults years after the initial bombing. Israel and Egypt, as well as Syria, are also not parties to this convention. The U.S. military has used cluster bombs in Afghanistan and Iraq, among other places. Moreover, the United States manufactures cluster bombs and recently sold 1,300 of them (for $640 million) to Saudi Arabia, which is ruled by an authoritarian monarchy with a miserable human-rights record. The U.S. government has also sold the weapons to Israel, Indonesia, and Pakistan.\n\nAmerican presidents love to brag about their world leadership.
