The Affordable Care Act has caused profound changes, affecting 30 million people nationwide.\n\n\"It is the law now that you have to have health insurance. If you don't have health insurance, you're going to be penalized unless you meet a number of different possible exemptions,\" said Tom Resnick, owner of Tax Frantic.\n\nThat penalty is $95 or one percent of your annual income.\n\nThere are more changes this year. For instance, bitcoin is taxable. If you receive payment or invested in virtual currency, you should include the fair market value of it with your income.\n\nIf you're a student, Pell Grants may now be allocated as a living expense.\n\nIf you're eligible, the number of income tax credits has increased.\n\nTax preparers say they usually have to make second appointments with clients because they usually forget something. You'll need your W-2 form and, if you purchased health insurance through Nevada Health Link, a 10-95 form.\n\nYou'll also need copies of your dependents' Social Security cards, your children's birth certificates and proof that your children live in your home.\n\nAlso, be sure to bring a copy of your previous tax return.\n\nTo be eligible for the Earned Income Tax Credit, you must make less than $47,000 a year if you have three children or $44,000 if you have two.\n\nApril 15 is the deadline to file taxes.\n\nCopyright 2015 KVVU (KVVU Broadcasting Corporation).
