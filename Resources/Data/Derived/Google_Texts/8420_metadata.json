(NBC)\n\nMany an episode of \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d has opened at the White House. From Bill and Hillary\u2019s marriage troubles to Obamacare meetings, we\u2019re always poised to see a cast favorite don a suit and a wig to impersonate our top politicos.\n\nThat\u2019s how Saturday\u2019s episode began, with Jay Pharoah as President Obama giving the stink eye to Rep. John Boehner and Sens. Ted Cruz and Tom Cotton. And then, the man impersonating the president wasn\u2019t Pharoah anymore: Dwayne Johnson, \u201cThe Rock,\u201d became Barack Obama.\n\nOr, rather, \u201cThe Rock Obama.\u201d\n\nHis bulging muscles rip his shirt, his feet outgrow his shoes, and somehow he also acquires chest tattoos.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be alarmed,\u201d he tells the scared lawmakers. \u201cThe Rock Obama much like Barack Obama, only larger and more violent.\u201d\n\nLater in the night, Johnson starred in a Wrestlemania skit and a trailer for a Disney remake of \u201cBambi.\u201d We\u2019ve been through live-action \u201cCinderella\u201d and \u201cMaleficent\u201d remakes, so a human playing a big-eyed doe must be next, right? A human playing a big-eyed doe with guns in both paws and a cigar in his mouth. (But still a butterfly on his nose!)\n\n\u201cWhen I was a boy, they took away my mother. Now it\u2019s time for them to pay \u2013 deerly.\u201d\n\nMore of SNL\u2019s best sketches:\n\nMeet SNL\u2019s new Hillary Clinton: Kate McKinnon\n\n\u201950 Shades\u2019 star Dakota Johnson faces the awkwardness of being Dakota Johnson on SNL\n\nWatch the \u2018SNL\u2019 Ferguson skit that didn\u2019t make the cut", "article_metadata": {"description": "Move over, Jay Pharoah, Dwayne Johnson is taking over.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/jessica.contrera", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Move over, Jay Pharoah, Dwayne Johnson is taking over.", "title": "Watch \u2018The Rock\u2019 play (a very angry) Obama on \u2018Saturday Night Live\u2019", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2015/03/29/watch-the-rock-play-a-very-angry-obama/", "image": "https://images.washingtonpost.com/?url=http://img.washingtonpost.com/blogs/style-blog/files/2015/03/Screen-Shot-2015-03-29-at-9.54.06-AM.png&w=1484&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "mjcontrera"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2015/03/29/watch-the-rock-play-a-very-angry-obama/", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "Obama; SNL; Dwayne Johnson; The Rock", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/jessica.contrera"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "Obama; SNL; Dwayne Johnson; The Rock"}, "article_summary": "That\u2019s how Saturday\u2019s episode began, with Jay Pharoah as President Obama giving the stink eye to Rep.
