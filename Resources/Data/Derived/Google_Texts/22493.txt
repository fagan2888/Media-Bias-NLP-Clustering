The Butte and Shasta County Public Health Departments said there is a gonorrhea epidemic.

In 2014, both Shasta and Butte counties saw outbreaks above and beyond any numbers they had ever dealt with before, stated authorities.

In Butte County, there were 300 confirmed cases reported. That is twice the number they had in 2013.

In Shasta County, between 2007 and 2011, an average of 38 cases were reported per year, but in 2014 there were 384 cases.

Gonorrhea is a bacterial infection that spreads through sexual contact. However, gonorrhea often has no signs or symptoms, making it hard to known for sure if you are infected, stated health officials.

Both public health departments are working with other local agencies to increase awareness, and hopefully stop the escalating spread.

"If you're sexually active, you should be getting checkups regularly and using a condom to prevent yourself from spreading the disease. So, the main reason why gonorrhea is spreading is because people aren't doing that," said William Ung, a public health nurse.

Ung recommended going to see either a doctor, STD clinic, or health care provider to be checked for STDs.
