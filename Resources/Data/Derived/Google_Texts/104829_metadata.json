I believe God has a sense of humor, not only because of my middle name and my affinity for Solomonic Proverbs, but because I, too, gained great renown by dividing babies. In my case, it was complexly joined craniopagus twins.\n\nOne of the verses that seems very pertinent to America today is Proverbs 22:7, which says, \u201cThe rich ruleth over the poor, and the borrower is servant to the lender.\u201d\n\nMost of us grew up hearing that debt is a very bad thing. The advent and wide dissemination of credit cards diminished such teachings, and those in charge of our nation\u2019s finances over the past few decades seem to revel in debt.\n\nAs a nation, we currently are carrying a national debt of $17.5 trillion. If we repaid it at a rate of $10 million per day, seven days a week, 365 days per year, it would take 4,700 years to repay.\n\nThe only reason that we can sustain such a level of debt is our status as the international reserve currency for the world.\n\nThis is a position usually reserved for the most reliable and strongest economic nation, and this status allows us to print money. If Greece could print money, it would not be bankrupt, although it would probably continue to drive up its debt.\n\nAdditionally, we have unfunded liabilities of at least $100 trillion.\n\nWhy am I concerned about this? I have been talking about this issue since long before Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s recent threat to abandon the U.S. dollar as Russia\u2019s reserve currency.\n\nUnless he could attract many other nations to do the same, he would likely inflict more short-term damage on his own country than on the United States.\n\nNevertheless, the very mention of such an action should send shivers down our spine. He recognizes our vulnerable position, which is exacerbated by our insistence on incurring unsustainable levels of debt. I have no doubt that at a strategic moment, he will exploit our weakness.\n\nA United Nations committee in 2010 recommended a change in world reserve currency policies, and others such as China have made similar suggestions. They are beginning to doubt the stability of America\u2019s financial infrastructure.\n\nOur continued fiscal irresponsibility not only threatens the financial well-being of the next generation of Americans, it also increasingly jeopardizes U.S. security.\n\nOur international influence is weakened as our borrower status makes us vulnerable to threats from Mr. Putin and others.\n\nPerhaps worst of all, if our status as the world\u2019s reserve currency issuer changes, there could be a dramatic decline in our standard of living.\n\nIf this occurs, the Occupy Wall Street movement will seem like a walk in the park compared with the civil unrest that will result. It does not require a great imagination to envision some of the freedom-limiting responses that might then occur.\n\nMany may say this is simply paranoia and fear-mongering, which is what the so-called elites traditionally say before a catastrophic collapse.\n\nThe good news is we can do better. However, we the people must first do our homework and make sure that we know who our congressional representatives are and how they vote, not how they say they vote.\n\nIf they are in favor of continued fiscal lunacy, as evidenced by their votes that keep raising our national debt, they need to be replaced by responsible candidates from any party who understand the implications of their actions.\n\nWe need people who understand that in order for businesses to grow and prosper, the government must remove the heavy boot of regulation and interference from their necks.\n\nWe need those who realize that taxation is supposed to provide the necessary revenues to operate a government that provides for the safety, infrastructure and freedom of the people.\n\nIt is not for the purpose of controlling behavior and certainly not to justify a government takeover of health care, thereby initiating the most massive shift of power from the people to the government in our history. By declaring pertinent parts of the Affordable Care Act a tax, the Supreme Court facilitated the demise of freedom in America.\n\nThese should not be partisan issues, but rather should be the concerns of every freedom-loving American citizen who wishes to see prosperity return to our shores.\n\nFiscal responsibility, fair taxation, intelligent environmental and energy policies, strong international leadership, evidence-based educational policies, cost-effective health care that is readily available to everyone, and honesty can prevail, but some feathers of those who are currently comfortable may need to be ruffled.\n\nWe need to discuss all of these things openly, rather than giving ear to the constant demagoguery that now exists. We must then vote responsibly with full knowledge of records and remain vigilant to preserve freedom and justice for all. We still have the power to craft a better future, but urgency grows.\n\nBen S.
