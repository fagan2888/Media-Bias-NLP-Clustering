Before the law was implemented, I repeatedly explained that more spending and more intervention in the healthcare sector would worsen a system that already was suffering from too much government. And since the law went into effect, I\u2019ve pointed out \u2013over and over again \u2013 the predictably negative effects of giving the government even more control.\n\nSo I\u2019m tempted to wash my hands of the issue. But that would be wrong, particularly since advocates of statism disingenuously might claim that silence somehow means acceptance or approval.\n\nMoreover, we need to continuously remind ourselves that big government doesn\u2019t work just in case there\u2019s a chance to enact good reforms after Obama leaves office. With that in mind, let\u2019s look at recent developments that underscore the case against government-run healthcare. How about the fact that ObamaCare is extremely vulnerable to fraud?\n\n\u2026the GAO report showed that federal auditors 11 out of 12 times were able to gain subsidized coverage with fictitious applications, three of the successful applications never provided citizenship or immigration documentation. The investigators in each case were able to obtain $2,500 or around $30,000 annually in advance premium tax credits.\n\nAnd what about the fact that the Obamacare co-ops have been a big flop?\n\nNonprofit co-ops, the health care law\u2019s public-spirited alternative to mega-insurers, are awash in red ink and many have fallen short of sign-up goals, a government audit has found. Under President Barack Obama\u2019s overhaul, taxpayers provided $2.4 billion in loans to get the co-ops going, but only one out of 23 \u2014 the one in Maine \u2014 made money last year, said the report out Thursday. Another one\u2026was shut down by regulators over financial concerns. The audit by the Health and Human Services inspector general\u2019s office also found that 13 of the 23 lagged far behind their 2014 enrollment projections.\n\nOr what about the fact that deductibles have increased under ObamaCare?\n\nA survey released earlier this week by the Kaiser Family Foundation found that..deductibles have risen almost three times as fast since 2010 for employer-sponsored plans.\n\nAnd should we care that ObamaCare has meant rising health care costs?\n\n\u2026the actuaries estimated that health spending that year jumped by 5.5 percent, a bigger rise than the country had experienced in five years. \u2026The actuaries cited three main reasons they think health spending is set to tick up. One is the aging of the population\u2026 Another is the improving economy\u2026 But the third, and a big one, was Obamacare\u2019s coverage expansion.\n\nAll of the aforementioned things are contrary to what ObamaCare supporters promised. Though since I focus on policy rather than politics, I\u2019ll take this opportunity to point out that higher deductibles in some ways are a good thing. Which is why I\u2019ve defended ObamaCare\u2019s Cadillac tax.\n\nBut now let\u2019s look at two additional ObamaCare developments. And both represent very bad news.\n\nFirst, new scholarly research shows that ObamaCare will be bad news for all income levels, and even will be of questionable value to those getting big subsidies (h/t: Marginal Revolution).\n\n\u2026the average financial burden will increase for all income levels once insured. Subsidy-eligible persons with incomes below 250 percent of the poverty threshold likely experience welfare improvements that offset the higher financial burden, depending on assumptions about risk aversion and the value of additional consumption of medical care. However, even under the most optimistic assumptions, close to half of the formerly uninsured (especially those with higher incomes) experience both higher financial burden and lower estimated welfare.\n\nIn other words, people generally were making sensible choices when they had some degree of freedom. But now that they\u2019re being coerced into ObamaCare,many of them are worse off. Even in many cases if they\u2019re the ones getting subsidized!\n\nSecond, we now know that President Obama\u2019s promise to lower health insurance premiums by $2,500 was laughably misleading. But it\u2019s not simply that the President exaggerated. As Investor\u2019s Business Daily explains, the numbers actually have gone in the other direction.\n\nSince 2008, average family premiums have climbed a total of $4,865. The White House cheered the news, saying it was a sign of continued slow growth in premium costs. \u2026Slightly less higher premiums aren\u2019t what President Obama promised Americans when he ran for office touting his medical overhaul. He specifically said his plan would cut premiums. \u201cWe will start,\u201d Obama said back in 2008, \u201cby reducing premiums by as much as $2,500 per family.\u201d\n\nAnd keep in mind that Obama\u2019s claim of big savings was not a one-time, off-the-cuff comment. As you can see in this video, it was a pervasive part of his campaign for further government control of the health care system.\n\nBut the real story isn\u2019t prevarication by a politician. That comes with the territory. The real issue is that our healthcare system is more screwed up because government now is playing a bigger role. And keep in mind that fixing the problem means a lot more than simply repealing Obamacare. We also need to deal with spending programs such as Medicare and Medicaid and address tax preferences and regulations that encourage over-insurance.\n\nAfter all, never forget that our real healthcare crisis is a giant government-caused third-party payer problem.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "ObamaCare, Healthcare, Health, Politics, Barack Obama, Obama", "generator": "PPD News Network", "og": {"site_name": "People's Pundit Daily", "description": "ObamaCare is and always will be a disaster because the healthcare sector was already suffering from too much government and too much intervention.", "title": "ObamaCare is Still a Disaster", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 740, "identifier": "http://www.peoplespunditdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/obamacare-obama-lie.jpg", "height": 400}, "url": "http://www.peoplespunditdaily.com/policy/2015/09/25/obamacare-is-still-a-disaster/", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"description": "ObamaCare is and always will be a disaster because the healthcare sector was already suffering from too much government and too much intervention.", "creator": "@danieljmitchell", "image": "http://www.peoplespunditdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/obamacare-obama-lie.jpg", "title": "ObamaCare is Still a Disaster | People's Pundit Daily", "site": "@PPDNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "al": {"web": {"url": "http://www.peoplespunditdaily.com/policy/2015/09/25/obamacare-is-still-a-disaster/", "should_fallback": "true"}, "android": {"url": "com.peoplespunditdaily.app://://post/30804", "app_name": "People\\'s Pundit Daily", "package": "com.zeen101.peoplespunditdaily.app.android"}, "ios": {"url": "com.peoplespunditdaily.app://://post/30804", "app_name": "People\\'s Pundit Daily", "app_store_id": 1019177493}}, "BridPlugin": "oauth_token:ef63637f2cb1a477b40092f3568d5f17a64208c9|user_id:1413|width:660|height:371|autoplay:0|site:1938|player:2077|question:1|upload:1|intro_enabled:1|ovr_yt:1|ovr_def:1|aspect:1|visual:0", "keywords": "ObamaCare, Healthcare, Health, Politics, Barack Obama, Obama", "article": {"section": "Policy", "tag": "obamacare", "published_time": "2015-09-25T14:08:17-04:00"}, "description": "ObamaCare is and always will be a disaster because the healthcare sector was already suffering from too much government and too much intervention."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca4df\"", "article_summary": "And should we care that ObamaCare has meant rising health care costs?\nHealthcare Sector Was Already Suffering from Too Much Government, Money and InterventionLike many Americans, I\u2019m suffering from ObamaCare fatigue.\n\u2026the actuaries estimated that health spending that year jumped by 5.5 percent, a bigger rise than the country had experienced in five years.\n\u2026The actuaries cited three main reasons they think health spending is set to tick up.\nAs you can see in this video, it was a pervasive part of his campaign for further government control of the health care system."}
