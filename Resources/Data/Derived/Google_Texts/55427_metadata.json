Sharing in it brings that reality to life. Plus, many of us need to be focusing on our retirement savings and we can\u2019t afford to pay for 100% of the cost of our children\u2019s college expense, no matter whether we want to or not.\n\nWe want our young scholars to get the most out of their college experience, and develop a love for learning. Part of this education can, and should be in my opinion, learning how to balance the demands of college and a wage-earning job. Most people that I\u2019ve met over age 40 either paid all or part of their college and/or living expenses by working and taking out loans, which they repaid after graduation. I worked 30-40 hours a week through college and was involved in sports and other activities. My jobs were part time to accommodate my classes and activities schedule.\n\nHowever, it seems that parents of my generation often do not intend for their student to work, even though they typically did. The parents say the child\u2019s job is to focus on their studies and enjoy their college experience. I don\u2019t disagree. However, I\u2019d also give them another job or two, which earns an income. My parents paid for my tuition and books; however, I had to pay for my living expenses. Their rationale was that I could live at home while attending our local college. I choose to move out, so was then responsible for my own room and board and spending money. I think it was a very good education.\n\nSheryl Garrett (@SherylGarrett) is founder of the Garrett Planning Network Inc.\n\nRead the latest Wealth Management Report.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "title": "College Kids Need to Have \u2018Skin in the Game\u2019", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/experts/2014/02/10/college-kids-need-to-have-skin-in-the-game/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/img/WSJ_profile_lg.gif"}, "site": "WSJ", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "US", "article.headline": "College Kids Need to Have \u2018Skin in the Game\u2019", "article_section": "US", "author": "Cristina Lourosa", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "The Experts Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "The Experts", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2014-02-10T11:50:27-05:00", "dj.asn": "10-140", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/experts/2014/02/10/college-kids-need-to-have-skin-in-the-game/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-258B-2257", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "US", "language": "en-US", "og": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/experts/2014/02/10/college-kids-need-to-have-skin-in-the-game/", "site_name": "WSJ", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/blogs/img/WSJ_Logo_BlackBackground_1200x630social", "height": 630}, "type": "article", "title": "College Kids Need to Have \u2018Skin in the Game\u2019"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "The Experts", "article.id": "BL-258B-2257", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2014-02-10T11:50:39-05:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcdd6b\"", "article_summary": "Should parents insist that their kids work in college to help pay for their education?\nMy parents paid for my tuition and books; however, I had to pay for my living expenses.\nWe want our young scholars to get the most out of their college experience, and develop a love for learning.\nThe parents say the child\u2019s job is to focus on their studies and enjoy their college experience.\nPart of this education can, and should be in my opinion, learning how to balance the demands of college and a wage-earning job."}
