Photo: Associated Press\n\nThe Republican establishment in Donald Trump\u2019s home state doesn\u2019t appear quite sold on the GOP presidential primary front-runner, but it may be edging closer ahead of New York\u2019s April 19 primary.\n\nThe New York Republican State Committee said Wednesday that it intends to welcome the \u201cfellow New Yorker\u201d as a \u201cfeatured guest\u201d at its annual gala, five days before the primary.\n\nFor the first time in many years, New York\u2019s presidential primary is expected to have a meaningful impact on the race, and the Republican candidates have started to shift their attention to the state, with Texas Sen. Ted Cruz holding several events there this week. The NY GOP said it has invited all three Republican presidential candidates to attend its gala.\n\nThe state\u2019s Republican party leadership, however, hasn\u2019t coalesced around a candidate, and Mr. Trump\u2019s dominance in the primary race thus far appears to have flummoxed some of the New York GOP\u2019s leading figures.\n\nAt its annual convention earlier this month, the party failed to put forth a resolution in support of Mr. Trump or any other contender.\n\nAnd New York\u2019s top-ranking Republican elected official, state Sen. Majority Leader John Flanagan, said through a spokesman that he doesn\u2019t expect to endorse anyone prior to the state\u2019s primary.\n\n\u201cSenator Flanagan believes in the electoral process and recognizes that New York may very well play a critical role in the ultimate selection of our President,\u201d his spokesman, Scott Reif, said. \u201cTherefore, he has not endorsed a candidate ahead of the state\u2019s upcoming April 19 primary, but he does expect to support the Party\u2019s nominee this fall.\u201d\n\nThe party\u2019s chairman, Ed Cox, who has endured criticism from some other party leaders for not having backed the Manhattan businessman, said Wednesday that the GOP is \u201cthrilled\u201d to host Mr. Trump at its gala.\n\n\u201cThis year has become one of the most exciting and vital presidential elections in many years,\u201d Mr. Cox said in the announcement.\n\n\u201cNew York Republicans are more motivated than ever to take back the White House, and for the first time in a long time, will play a decisive role by their votes in the April 19th presidential primary.\u201d\n\nMore\n\nCruz\u2019s Utah Win Doesn\u2019t Derail Trump\u2019s Delegate Momentum\n\nJeb Bush Endorses Ted Cruz\n\nSanders Now Needs Landslides to Stop Clinton", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "The Republican establishment in Donald Trump\u2019s home state doesn\u2019t appear quite sold on the GOP presidential primary front-runner, but it may be edging closer ahead of New York\u2019s April 19 primary.", "title": "New York GOP Establishment Shows Signs of Warming to Donald Trump", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2016/03/23/new-york-gop-establishment-shows-signs-of-warming-to-donald-trump/", "image": {"src": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-NF762_TrumpJ_P_20160323143102.jpg"}, "site": "WSJPolitics", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Politics", "article.headline": "New York GOP Establishment Shows Signs of Warming to Donald Trump", "description": "The Republican establishment in Donald Trump\u2019s home state doesn\u2019t appear quite sold on the GOP presidential primary front-runner, but it may be edging closer ahead of New York\u2019s April 19 primary.", "article_section": "Politics", "author": "Erica Orden", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "Washington Wire Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "Washington Wire", "article.summary": "The Republican establishment in Donald Trump\u2019s home state doesn\u2019t appear quite sold on the GOP presidential primary front-runner, but it may be edging closer ahead of New York\u2019s April 19 primary.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2016-03-23T18:42:29-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-160", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2016/03/23/new-york-gop-establishment-shows-signs-of-warming-to-donald-trump/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-WB-62257", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Politics", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "The Republican establishment in Donald Trump\u2019s home state doesn\u2019t appear quite sold on the GOP presidential primary front-runner, but it may be edging closer ahead of New York\u2019s April 19 primary.", "title": "New York GOP Establishment Shows Signs of Warming to Donald Trump", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2016/03/23/new-york-gop-establishment-shows-signs-of-warming-to-donald-trump/", "image": {"width": 749, "identifier": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-NF762_TrumpJ_P_20160323143102.jpg", "height": 499}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Washington Wire", "article.id": "BL-WB-62257", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2016-03-23T18:43:23-04:00"}, "article_summary": "The NY GOP said it has invited all three Republican presidential candidates to attend its gala.\nMajority Leader John Flanagan, said through a spokesman that he doesn\u2019t expect to endorse anyone prior to the state\u2019s primary.\nAt its annual convention earlier this month, the party failed to put forth a resolution in support of Mr. Trump or any other contender.\nDonald Trump gives a thumbs-up as he leaves for lunch after being summoned for jury duty in New York last August.\nThe New York Republican State Committee said Wednesday that it intends to welcome the \u201cfellow New Yorker\u201d as a \u201cfeatured guest\u201d at its annual gala, five days before the primary."}
