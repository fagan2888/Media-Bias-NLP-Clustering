Starting in one week, South Bend will mark its 30th celebration of the national Martin Luther King Jr. holiday with the huge breadth of activities that local organizers have built over those decades.

The city, under then-Mayor Roger Parent, had sponsored the first year’s events in 1986, which was the first year that the nation observed the new federal holiday. The next year, a local group took it over — the Martin Luther King Jr. Foundation of St. Joseph County, which awards scholarships to minorities — and has been running it ever since.

“Even as a community with the challenges we face, we still come together,” said longtime organizer Gladys Muhammad. “People come together from all walks of life to celebrate Dr. Martin Luther King … and justice for everyone.”

The Tribune will publish the full list of activities in coming days. For now, here are events that require reservations or happen soon:

• The Little Taste of Peace, which gathers people of different faiths, races and ethnicities to discuss solutions to current issues that address King’s dreams, will be from 6:30 to 9:30 p.m. Jan. 16 at The Beacon, 4210 Lincoln Way W., South Bend. Doors open at 6:15 p.m. Participants are asked to bring a dessert or finger food to share, but no pork. Reservations are needed by 5 p.m. Friday at aschortgen@ywcancin.org, ywcancin.org or 574-233-9491, ext. 316.

• The Community Service Recognition Breakfast will run from 7:30 to 9 a.m. Jan. 18 at the Century Center, 120 S. St. Joseph St. The speaker will be Derrick Campbell, divisional manager of labor relations for General Motors in Michigan, who attended South Bend schools and earned his bachelor’s degree from the University of Notre Dame. Campbell is passionate about teaching young people about personal finance.

The event will present this year’s Drum Major Award to six winners who were selected by Mishawaka Mayor Dave Wood and South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg for their community service. The Mishawaka winners are Clara Davis of HealthLinc-Mishawaka; security director John Collins of Saint Joseph Health System’s Mishawaka Medical Center and volunteer Carol Laidig of Laidig Systems. South Bend winners are volunteer and Realtor Abraham Marcus, Bishop Eddie and Diane Miller of Faith Apostolic Ministries, and Monica Tetzlaff of the Civil Rights Heritage Center at Indiana University South Bend.
