PHILADELPHIA (CBS) — If you’re getting paperwork together to have your taxes done, you’ll need one more thing this year: your health insurance card.

As you gather your bank statements, donation slips and W-2’s, you’ll also need to have proof that you have health insurance.

It’s part of the Affordable Care Act, or ObamaCare.

Tony Galani a CPA in Oaks, Montgomery County says some of his clients have been surprised when he asks if they have health insurance.

“As a tax professional we’re required to ask that question and taxpayers are to tell us weather they have the insurance or not. We’re not auditing clients, merely asking them if they have insurance.”

If they don’t they face penalties or must apply for an exemption.
