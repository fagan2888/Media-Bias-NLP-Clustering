full-service, managed care organization and health plan administrator in El Paso, recently achieved a perfect score in its first bid for national accreditation.\n\nA non-profit subsidiary of University Medical Center and the El Paso County Hospital District, El Paso First began operations in 1999 as a third-party administrator, a line of business it continues as Preferred Administrators.\n\nThat means it is the group health-care provider for its own employees and those of UMC and El Paso Children\u2019s Hospital.\n\n\u201cWe probably offer the lowest premiums in town,\u201d said Frank Dominguez, El Paso First\u2019s president and CEO since 2013.\n\nToday, El Paso First has 92,000 customers and is the No. 1 medical administrator in the El Paso market for Medicaid and the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program, or CHIP, with 71,000 participants, Dominguez said.\n\n\u201cWe also rank No. 1 in the state in many of the preventative services and well-child visits for Medicaid,\u201d he said.\n\nEl Paso First also administers a unique network through UMC for mostly adult medical indigents who are ineligible for Medicaid but tend to be heavy users of the county hospital\u2019s expensive emergency room services.\n\n\u201cWe treat them like the Medicaid population where they get a benefit card and a schedule of covered services, but it\u2019s not a health insurance plan,\u201d Dominguez said.\n\nThe plan\u2019s 14,000 members don\u2019t pay premiums but are charged co-payments and have deductibles for doctor visits and other medical services.\n\nThe program is meant to encourage members to take advantage of preventative care services, visit their doctor when necessary and to keep them from making unnecessary visits to the emergency room.\n\n\u201cWe believe preventative care is the key to reducing health care costs,\u201d Dominguez said.\n\nTwo other Texas counties are in the process of starting similar programs, but El Paso County is the first and only community that has one up and running, he said.\n\nEl Past First received notice April 1 of its accreditation by URAC, formerly known as the Utilization Review Accreditation Commission.\n\nURAC is the only agency in the country that accredits health care organizations, administrators, health plans, health call centers and health websites.\n\nWhile the March inspection of El Paso First\u2019s operation only took two days, Dominguez said, the preparations took about two years and were expensive.\n\n\u201cAccreditation means customers will receive due process,\u201d he said. \u201cThere will be transparency in the services we provide through the health network or in dealing with health plans directly, and there will be an appeal process if they have a complaint.\u201d\n\nIt also means El Paso First must adhere to established standards for health care and customer service.\n\nDominguez said El Paso First had to seek accreditation because the federal Affordable Care Act, better known as Obamacare, requires it.\n\nBut being accredited now opens the door to participation in the national health exchanges.\n\n\u201cAccreditation would allow us to be a health-plan carrier for network accessibility, allowing individuals to come in,\u201d Dominguez said.\n\nVenturing into the Obamacare exchange market would require approval of El Paso First\u2019s board and a name change.\n\n\u201cWe decided to choose a name while we\u2019re looking into the pros and cons of it,\u201d Dominguez said. \u201cWe\u2019re even having a contest for the best new name.\u201d\n\nDominguez conceded that the initial market would be limited because El Paso First only has agreements and negotiated rates with providers in El Paso and Hudspeth counties.\n\nBut, he said, it would be possible to buy into another health plan\u2019s provider network.\n\nEmail El Paso Inc. reporter David Crowder at dcrowder@elpasoinc.com or call (915) 534-4422,
