Scott Walker (R) that runs counter to the central claim of a lawsuit called King v. Burwell, which seeks to undermine the Affordable Care Act. Almost immediately, this statement drew comparisons to MIT economist Jonathan Gruber\u2019s infamous remarks that have been seized upon by Obamacare\u2019s opponents in an effort to bolster this lawsuit. Yet, while both statements obviously have political significance, King is a legal case and not a political debate. Under existing law and Supreme Court precedents, Walker\u2019s statement has far more legal significance than Gruber\u2019s.\n\nWalker and Gruber\n\nThe plaintiffs in King, which is currently pending before the Supreme Court, claim that the Affordable Care Act only authorizes tax credits to help people pay for their health insurance in states that elected to set up their own Obamacare exchange. Residents of states that elected to have the federal government set up this exchange for them are out of luck, according to the King Plaintiffs. Yet, in a 2013 interview, Walker said that \u201cthere\u2019s no real substantive difference between a federal exchange, or a state exchange\u201d a view that directly contradicts the plaintiffs\u2019 central premise in King.\n\nThe Supreme Court of the United States is supposed to be above politics. And it is not supposed to base its decisions upon how many times a once-obscure economist is mocked by Bill O\u2019Reilly.\n\nGruber, meanwhile, is an economist who has hyperbolically been described as the \u201carchitect\u201d of Obamacare. In reality, according to the Center for American Progress\u2019s Neera Tanden, he worked as a consultant for the Department of Health and Human Services providing economic models predicting \u201cthe impact of various subsidy levels and rules.\u201d In 2012, Gruber gave a talk where he took two conflicting positions. Gruber initially seemed to agree with Walker\u2019s position that state and federal exchanges both provide tax credits \u2014 \u201cso these health insurance exchanges . . . will be these new shopping places and they\u2019ll be the place that people go to get their subsidies for health insurance. In the law it says if the states don\u2019t provide them the federal backstop will.\u201d In the very next paragraph of his talk, however, he warned that \u201cif you\u2019re a state and you don\u2019t set up an exchange, that means your citizens don\u2019t get their tax credits.\u201d The King plaintiffs quote the second part of this talk (and ignore the first part of it) in their brief.\n\nAt Vox, Sarah Kliff argues that Gruber\u2019s statement will prove more significant than Walker\u2019s to the Supreme Court. \u201cScott Walker, obviously, was not in Congress helping to write the law,\u201d Kliff claims, \u201cand so his words probably won\u2019t do much to sway the Supreme Court.\u201d Meanwhile, at least according to the King plaintiffs, \u201cGruber was consulting with Congress and the White House during the health law\u2019s drafting, and should have a decent sense of what legislators were thinking.\u201d\n\nSlate\u2019s Betsy Woodruff, meanwhile, quotes one of the leading proponents of the King lawsuit\u2019s questioning our characterization of Walker\u2019s remark, and then somewhat bizarrely offering additional corroborating evidence showing that our characterization of Walker\u2019s views is correct. Though the Cato Institute\u2019s Michael Cannon describes our original piece on Walker as \u201clazy, awful, dumb stuff,\u201d claiming that we took Walker\u2019s remarks out of context, he then offers additional evidence indicating that Walker does indeed disagree with the King plaintiffs\u2019 reading of the law. Walker, according to Cannon, \u201cis the only Republican governor who refused to establish an exchange but still put forward a proposal that relied on there being subsidies in a federal exchange\u201d (Kliff reported on the details of this plan here). So even if our characterization of Walker\u2019s remarks were incorrect, it is clear based on the evidence Cannon himself cites that Walker did not embrace the King plaintiffs\u2019 reading of the law.\n\nThe Significance of Walker\u2019s Views\n\nWhich brings us to the question of how much Walker\u2019s (and Gruber\u2019s) statements should matter under the law. Though some judges believe that legislative history \u2014 that is, the \u201cdocuments that are produced by Congress as a bill is introduced, studied and debated\u201d \u2014 are relevant to determining how to read a law, statements made after the law is enacted are typically dismissed out of turn by the justices. As the Supreme Court explained in Heintz v. Jenkins, a statement by a lawmaker which is made \u201cnot during the legislative process, but after the statute became law. . . . is not a statement upon which other legislators might have relied in voting for or against the Act, but it simply represents the views of one informed person on an issue about which others may (or may not) have thought differently.\u201d\n\nNormally, courts would treat both Walker and Gruber\u2019s statements even more dismissively because neither man was in the legislature during Obamacare\u2019s enactment. Walker\u2019s statement, however, falls into an exception to this rule that makes it highly relevant to the outcome of King. To understand why, it\u2019s important to understand fully how the King plaintiffs characterize the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe King plaintiffs\u2019 reading of the law is unconstitutional.\n\nThe essence of the King plaintiffs\u2019 reading of the law is that Congress viewed the question of whether state or federal bureaucrats operate each exchange as a matter of such overarching importance that they were willing to deny health care to millions of people \u2014 in order to ensure that the people running the exchanges all drew a state paycheck. The plaintiffs argue that the tax credits are part of \u201ca variety of \u2018carrots\u2019 and \u2018sticks\u2019 to induce states to establish Exchanges voluntarily.\u201d In essence, they claim, Congress used the threat that a state\u2019s citizens could lose access to billions of dollars worth of subsidies in order to coerce the states into setting up their own exchange.\n\nThe Constitution places limits on states\u2019 power to do this sort of thing, however. When the federal government conditions payment of federal money upon states taking a particular action, those conditions are unconstitutional \u201cif a State is unaware of the conditions or is unable to ascertain what is expected of it.\u201d Moreover, the question or whether a state is able to ascertain what strings come attached to the funds is evaluated \u201cfrom the perspective of a state official who is engaged in the process of deciding whether the State should accept . . . the obligations that go with those funds.\u201d\n\nThis is why Walker\u2019s views hold special significance. Walker, in his own words, \u201cspent nearly two years\u201d studying the differences between state and federal exchanges, and he learned that \u201cthere\u2019s no real substantive difference between a federal exchange [and] a state exchange.\u201d Indeed, as Cannon points out, Walker set up an entire state program premised on the idea that federally-run exchanges are permitted to provide tax credits just like state-run exchanges. Walker\u2019s views, in other words, demonstrate that \u201ca state official who is engaged in the process of deciding whether\u201d Wisconsin should set up its own exchange was unable to ascertain the alleged consequences of this decision. Thus, even if the King plaintiffs are correct that Obamacare conditions tax credits on a state setting up its own exchange, that condition is unconstitutional.\n\nWalker, it should be noted, is hardly alone among Republican governors in his belief that \u201cthere\u2019s no real substantive difference between a federal exchange [and] a state exchange.\u201d Nebraska Gov. Dave Heineman (R) said that \u201c[o]n the key issues, there is no real operational difference between a federal exchange and a state exchange.\u201d Former Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell (R) explained that his state would opt for a federally-run exchange because there was no evidence of any \u201cclear benefits of a state run exchange to our citizens.\u201d A Supreme Court brief filed by the governors or attorneys general of 24 states explained that the Obamacare \u201ccan only operate in the manner that Congress intended\u201d if the tax credits are \u201cintact.\u201d\n\nThe law\u2019s staunchest opponents in the states, in other words, including two dozen officials who were actively trying to destroy the Affordable Care Act, were \u201cunable to ascertain\u201d that they could thwart one of the law\u2019s central provisions if they refused to set up a state-run exchange. The King plaintiffs\u2019 reading of the law is unconstitutional.\n\nCongress and Contracts\n\nOne caveat to this observation is that the Supreme Court has historically limited conditional grant programs under a slightly different set of circumstances than the plaintiffs allege in King. Typically, when Congress conditions a federal grant on states taking a particular action, they offer to give money to the state. This, for example, is how Medicaid works. The federal government offers money to the states that each state can use to provide health care to low-income individuals, but states that accept the money must comply with certain conditions.\n\nThe King plaintiffs, by contrast, claim that Obamacare offers money to third parties, but only if the state where those third parties reside agrees to comply with certain conditions. Nevertheless, this is a distinction that the King plaintiffs should not be able to make, according to Yale Law Professor Abbe Gluck. The King plaintiffs, \u201cframe their whole case on\u201d the idea that the law uses \u201ccarrots and sticks\u201d to goad states to set up their own exchanges, just like Medicaid uses a similar approach to coax the states into setting up health programs for their low-income residents. Obamacare\u2019s opponents, Gluck asserts, \u201ccan\u2019t have their cake and eat it too.\u201d That is, they \u201ccan\u2019t say it looks like Medicaid where it is relevant to [their argument],\u201d but it that doesn\u2019t look like Medicaid \u201cwhen it comes to Scott Walker\u2019s comments.\u201d\n\nThe Supreme Court\u2019s own decisions support the view that federal grants to states should not be treated differently than federal grants to third parties. In Pennhurst State School and Hospital v. Halderman, a seminal Supreme Court decision laying out the limits of federal conditional grant programs, the Court explained that \u201clegislation enacted pursuant to the spending power is much in the nature of a contract: in return for federal funds, the States agree to comply with federally imposed condition,\u201d adding that \u201c[t]he legitimacy of Congress\u2019 power to legislate under the spending power thus rests on whether the State voluntarily and knowingly accepts the terms of the \u2018contract.'\u201d\n\nObamacare\u2019s opponents . . . \u201ccan\u2019t have their cake and eat it too.\u201d\n\nIn a 2008 article published in the Duke Law Journal, University of Michigan Law Professor Samuel Bagenstos explains why this contract metaphor is relevant to King. The requirement that Congress speak clearly when it imposes conditions upon a federal grant stems, at least in part, from \u201cthe principle that ambiguous terms in contracts are construed against their drafters.\u201d If Ali drafts a contract where he agrees to pay Bob to paint his house, any ambiguities in that contract will be read in the light least favorable to Ali and most favorable to Bob. Similarly, if Ali drafts a contract where he agrees to pay Bob\u2019s brother if Bob paints his house, the ambiguous terms in the contract will also be construed against Bob even though Bob does not receive any actual money from Ali.\n\nUnder the Supreme Court\u2019s precedents, the same rule should apply to Congress. If Congress drafts legislation that may or may not be read impose conditions upon the states, it will be construed in favor of the states \u2014 that is, it will be construed not to place any obligations on the states. Moreover, this rule should apply regardless of whether Congress offers to give money to the state or to a third party \u2014 for the same reason that ordinary contract law applies to Ali regardless of whether he is expected to pay Bob or Bob\u2019s brother.\n\nLaw Is Not Politics \u2014 Or, At Least, It Shouldn\u2019t Be\n\nSo, to summarize the somewhat complicated legal explanation for why Walker\u2019s comments matter, in most cases, a non-lawmaker\u2019s post-enactment statements about a law would be ignored by the Supreme Court. A special rule applies, however, when the state official\u2019s statement informs the question of whether a law conditions federal spending on state action. In this case, Walker was one of many Republican state officials who, despite their desire to destroy Obamacare, read the law exactly the same way President Obama reads it \u2014 to guarantee tax credits in all 50 states. That alone is sufficient reason for the Supreme Court to reject the plaintiffs\u2019 arguments in King.\n\nNone of this means, of course, that Walker\u2019s comments will inflict the same political damage on Republicans that Gruber\u2019s inflicted on Obamacare supporters. As Woodruff quips, \u201cGruber has been a slow-motion car accident for the ACA\u2019s defenders,\u201d and this car wreck has been bolstered by a conservative media infrastructure eager to help take down Obama\u2019s chief accomplishment. According to the liberal media watchdog group Media Matters, Fox News devoted at least 57 segments to a video of Gruber that could be used to score political points against Obamacare in a single week. No media outlet has devoted even a fraction of this amount of time to Walker\u2019s video.\n\nNor does it mean that the justices themselves will rely on Walker\u2019s statements in their opinion \u2014 or even that Walker\u2019s views will make a difference in the outcome of the case. The plainitiffs\u2019 arguments in King are extraordinarily weak, even setting aside the question of whether they read the law in an unconstitutional way. The sort of justice who is inclined to side with these plaintiffs anyway may be so consumed by motivated reasoning that no amount of evidence or citations to legal sources could convince them to change their mind.\n\nBut none of that changes the fact that the Supreme Court of the United States is supposed to be above politics. And it is not supposed to base its decisions upon how many times a once-obscure economist is mocked by Bill O\u2019Reilly. If the highest Court in the land follows its own decisions, it will hold that tax credits are available in all 50 states.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "The Supreme Court of the United States is supposed to be above politics.
