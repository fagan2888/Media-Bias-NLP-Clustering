And just how incredible Kilian Jornet\u2019s 22-hour, 41-minute winning course-record run ranks among the sport\u2019s iconic times.\n\nNumerous people I spoke to along the 100\u00bd-mile route \u2014 fans who had come to watch in appreciation and awe, aid station volunteers, radio technicians, those who didn\u2019t get in but decided to pace other runners or assist as crew members \u2014 often repeated the words: \u201cHardrock is family.\u201d\n\nLast-minute addition\n\nRoger Kane was inside Silverton High School\u2019s locker room on the morning of July 11, lacing up his shoes, wrapping his feet in duct tape \u2014 blister prevention, naturally \u2014 and donning running shirt and shorts, preparing for a day mixed with spectating and a training session up the Bear Creek Trail near Ouray. He was the next one on the wait list, and although entrants had failed to appear at the start line before, it had happened maybe once or twice in the run\u2019s 21 years.\n\n\u201cI moped around Silverton all day Thursday,\u201d Kane said, \u201cnot really thinking I had a chance.\u201d\n\nAt 5:40 a.m., 20 minutes before the start of the race, Dale Garland, the run\u2019s longtime director, walked up to Kane in the locker room and handed him a wristband \u2014 what all run competitors are required to wear.\n\n\u201cAt that point, I was really incredulous. I just couldn\u2019t believe it,\u201d said Kane, who had run Hardrock in 2010, lives in Centenniel and works for RTD. \u201cAnd he asked me if I wanted to do it, and I said, \u2018Of course!\u2019 I was so thrilled and excited, I could barely function.\u201d\n\nProbably not a response most of us would offer, but Kane was getting a spot in one of the most difficult-to-get-into ultraruns in the country that takes its 140 entrants through San Juan\u2019s mountains between Silverton, Telluride, Lake City and Ouray. He had no crew, pacers or support beyond what the run provided at the 13 aid stations. (Pumpkin pie is a favorite energy source there, Kane said.) And he had just enough time to hand in his medical and contact information, text his wife to say he was in, throw together two drop bags \u2014 filled with a few supplies, to be sent to two aid stations \u2014 and scramble to the starting line.\n\nHe finished in 47 hours, 23 minutes, 44 seconds \u2014 just 36 minutes, 16 seconds before the race cutoff time.\n\nMaking the cutoff\n\nAmanda Grimes chose to cut it even closer than Kane.\n\nThe Steamboat Springs waitress started running in 2012 and eventually transitioned to ultrarunning, looking for the next great challenge. She ran her first 100-miler in 2013 at Leadville, and having finished only a handful of ultras, said she was among the least accomplished athletes in the field.\n\nAfter initially being waitlisted, she finally came off a few weeks before the start day. During the run, she steadily moved along, passing runners later in the race who had gone out too hard or were otherwise suffering and near dropping out. But for her, the last aid station near Mile 90 is where the race was most in doubt.\n\n\u201cRight before Cunningham, I had a mental breakdown,\u201d she recalled a week later, still with swollen feet and blisters. \u201cI had been moving for 37 hours. I had never stayed awake that long in my life. I thought it would be just straight up (after the station), but you had to keep climbing mountains after mountains.\u201d\n\nBy then, she was hallucinating: Cairns marking the course morphed into dogs, rocks appeared to be moving when she leaned against them for rest. At one point, a pile of rocks appeared like a sheet of paper printed with the image of a Buddha statue, she said.\n\nRealizing the 48-hour cutoff was near, Grimes and her pacer ran the final 6 miles into Silverton. As she was entering town, Garland, the run director, started running alongside her and cheering her on to kiss the Hardrock, the gesture that marks the end of the run.\n\nGrimes was the 100th and final official finisher, crossing in 47:50:35. Forty more who started had to drop out.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the proudest I\u2019ve ever been in my life,\u201d her husband, 37-year-old Billy Grimes, recalled with emotion. \u201cWe knew she had it in her, but after all that she had been through, her mental state and physical well-being, I wasn\u2019t sure I was doing the right thing by letting her leave that last aid station. But I knew she would regret it forever if she didn\u2019t try to finish.\u201d\n\nKeeping the streak alive\n\nKirk Apt, 52, is the ironman of Hardrock. He has never missed a run since 1992, when the race was first run.\n\nHe has started 21 races and finished 20, and is the only person who has competed every year. The only time he failed to make it back to Silverton was that first year, where he dropped out at the Sherman aid station near Mile 70 after what he said was a bout of food poisoning.\n\n\u201cFor the past five to eight years, I\u2019ve really slowed down,\u201d said Apt, who lives in Fruita. \u201cI\u2019m not really competitive anymore. Even when I was competitive as a runner, I didn\u2019t have much of a competitive head around (the run). It\u2019s always been my main focus keeping the streak going \u2014 whether 29 hours, my fastest, or nearly 40 hours like this year, I want to keep going.\u201d\n\nIn 2000, Apt won the run in just under 30 hours. The difference between ultrarunning then and now is a testament to how much more competitive the sport has become.\n\nLooking to next year\n\nInterest in Hardrock is expected to continue its torrid growth, both among those looking to compete, the spectators who attend and those covering it for media and sponsors. Garland told me the board of the run was examining how it might expand participation in future years without compromising the \u201cspirit of the run.\u201d As one pacer told me afterward, putting together an event that stretches through numerous towns and jurisdictions, and requires permits from the Bureau of Land Management and the U.S. Forest Service \u2014 as Hardrock does \u2014 would be near impossible today.\n\nHardrock remains an oddity as running and ultrarunning gain more mainstream acceptance, participation and commercialization. It eschews the practice of allowing the sport\u2019s stars to compete because they are stars; they too must go through the lottery system to get in. And even with high interest because of the competitive field this year, the run managed to retain a level of intimacy so rarely found in major races today.\n\n\u201cI lived for 20 years in Crested Butte and loved those mountains,\u201d Apt said. \u201cThe San Juans are on a different level \u2014 the massive climbs, the huge magnitude of the course. I look at it as a big family gathering that comes together to celebrate summer in the San Juans each year.\u201d\n\nDaniel Petty: 303-954-1081, dpetty@denverpost.com or twitter.com/danielpetty", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Hardrock 100 run a remarkable way to bring \u201cfamily\u201d together", "title": "Hardrock 100 run a remarkable way to bring \u201cfamily\u201d together", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/07/19/hardrock-100-run-a-remarkable-way-to-bring-family-together/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140719__run-hardrockp1.jpg", "height": 538}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140719__run-hardrockp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-07-19T19:46:37+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T05:51:13+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Running"}, "article_summary": "I just couldn\u2019t believe it,\u201d said Kane, who had run Hardrock in 2010, lives in Centenniel and works for RTD.\nBut for her, the last aid station near Mile 90 is where the race was most in doubt.\nHe has never missed a run since 1992, when the race was first run.\nEven when I was competitive as a runner, I didn\u2019t have much of a competitive head around (the run).\nHe had no crew, pacers or support beyond what the run provided at the 13 aid stations."}
