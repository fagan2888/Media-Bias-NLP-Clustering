The new White Castle at 700 W. Broadway opened Sunday, the Columbus, Ohio-based restaurant chain said.

The store there replaces one that closed for demolition late last summer.

"White Castle has had a presence in Louisville for many years," Lisa Ingram, chief operating officer of White Castle, said in a statement. "As we explore new locations to open Castles, we know how important it is to reinvest in the cities where we're currently located. That's exactly what we did in Louisville."

The new store is a 2,793-square-foot building and accommodates 53 people in the dining room. The new store keeps 30 jobs and could lead to 10 more, the company said.

Louisville's first White Castle opened across the street in 1927, according to the company. The current site has been in use for at least about 50 years.
