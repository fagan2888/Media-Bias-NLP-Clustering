John Kasich will take all 88 counties and win by more 20 points.\n\nWhy?\n\nWhen leftists and like-minded Republicans claim Kasich\u2019s landslide win proves \u201ccompassionate conservatism\u201d is sound swing state policy, consider the factors \u2014 other than incumbency and a huge cash advantage \u2014 leading to Tuesday\u2019s result.\n\nDemocrat self-destruction\n\nEarly Quinnipiac University polling on the governor\u2019s race showed practically no name recognition for eventual Democrat nominee Ed FitzGerald. In December 2012, 84 percent of respondents to a statewide poll said they hadn\u2019t heard enough to form an opinion of the Cuyahoga County executive.\n\nThis August, Northeast Ohio Media Group reported FitzGerald and a woman who was not his wife were found in a car in a Cleveland parking lot at 4:30 one morning in 2012. FitzGerald was not cited and insists nothing untoward was going on, but his explanation of the incident conflicted with an aide\u2019s.\n\nIf a story with the makings of a political sex scandal was not enough, The Columbus Dispatch discovered FitzGerald did not have a permanent driver\u2019s license at the time of the incident and was not licensed to drive alone from 2008 to 2012. The governor\u2019s race was over by September, as Ohio Democratic Party chairman Chris Redfern implicitly acknowledged by criticizing FitzGerald in a New York Times interview.\n\nRedfern\u2019s tenure as head of ODP is likely at an end, but Matt Mayer, president of free-market think tank Opportunity Ohio, noted Democrats have had little success statewide over the past two decades.\n\n\u201cThe Ohio Democratic Party is historically inept given total statewide Republican control from 1995 to today except for one gubernatorial, Attorney General, and Treasurer win in 2006 due to a national anti-Bush wave and a two year House speakership due to Obama\u2019s first wave election,\u201d Mayer explained in an email to Ohio Watchdog.\n\n\u201cDespite what he thinks, Kasich is just another chapter in that twenty year story,\u201d Mayer added.\n\nKeeping a Lid on Republican Criticism\n\nThe Ohio Republican Party has been run by hand-picked Kasich supporters since 2012. Unburdened by a party platform, ORP works to promote Kasich and his allies while attacking their critics on the left and the right.\n\nLast summer, when dozens of county Republican Party chairs were asked to comment on the Obamacare Medicaid expansion \u2014 which Kasich campaigned against in 2010 \u2014 instructions went out to adhere to Kasich\u2019s new pro-Obamacare talking points.\n\nWith ORP and legislative caucus purse strings held by backers of the governor, his administration has been able to minimize legislators\u2019 public criticism of Medicaid expansion and other Kasich proposals. Kasich\u2019s history as a Fox News host also helps him convey the appearance of strong Republican support for his policies.\n\nTed Stevenot, a leader of limited-government nonprofit Ohio Rising, encourages Ohioans to get more involved in a political process that starts long before general election season.\n\n\u201cKasich\u2019s victory is more a statement about the power of the party\u2019s control over elections than it is about the voter\u2019s support of his agenda,\u201d Stevenot said in an email to Ohio Watchdog. \u201cThe same is true in other races and we will see many people \u2018undervote\u2019 in this election either by not voting at all or by not voting for either candidate.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor things to change, the people must engage in reforming and taking back the party apparatus,\u201d Stevenot continued. \u201cUntil they do, voters should only expect more of the same.\u201d\n\nNo Libertarian Option\n\nLibertarian Ken Matesz took 2.39 percent of the statewide gubernatorial vote in 2010, but even if this year\u2019s race were close Kasich wouldn\u2019t have to worry about the impact of a Libertarian candidate.\n\nLibertarian Charlie Earl initially qualified for the ballot but was removed after a legal challenge coordinated with input from Kasich\u2019s re-election campaign. As a result, the only other candidates on the ballot are FitzGerald and Green Party nominee Anita Rios \u2014 unlikely recipients of protest votes from dissatisfied Republicans.\n\nPress promotion of Kasich\u2019s Obamacare expansion\n\nLegacy news coverage has framed Gov. Kasich\u2019s Obamacare Medicaid expansion as a self-evident good, burying evidence the expansion will not improve health, will hurt the state\u2019s labor force and will cost Ohio billions.\n\nSince early 2013, Ohio\u2019s largest newspapers have repeated pro-Obamacare rhetoric without skepticism and hammered critics as hateful ideologues. The Dispatch, in particular, has made little effort to differentiate its news and opinion coverage of the issue.\n\nOpenly advocating in favor of the signature policy of the governor\u2019s first term, the press encouraged Kasich to expand Medicaid unilaterally and then applauded his bravery and leadership when he did so. Editorial boards emphasized Kasich\u2019s Obamacare expansion in their endorsements this fall.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Why is the big question in the governor's race in the presidential swing state of Ohio whether incumbent Gov.
