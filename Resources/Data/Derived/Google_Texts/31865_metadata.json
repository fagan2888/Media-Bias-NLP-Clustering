The two apparently purchase insurance through the same company. Hughes had not checked his mail since the new year started, so he was not certain if his family\u2019s coverage had been cancelled.\n\n\u201cApparently, and I did not know this, apparently, I must not have been happy with my current insurance,\u201d said a sarcastic Cumia. \u201cBecause I heard from the president, if I was happy, I would able to keep it\u2026but I guess I wasn\u2019t happy and they knew,\u201d continued the outspoken critic of the Obama administration.\n\nTheBlaze reached out to the radio star regarding the cancellation. He responded via direct messaging on Twitter.\n\nWhen asked if he had logged onto the Obamacare website and surveyed possible options available there, Cumia said, \u201dI\u2019ve done nothing yet. It expires in Feb. No clue what I need to do to get the same quality care. Such bulls**t. \u201cYou can keep it\u201d, oh yeah?\u201d\n\n\u201cI was with them for 8yrs, NEVER considered Obamacare,dropped due to new law,\u201d the radio host added.\n\nTheBlaze pressed Cumia on the type of coverage he had, asking if it was less than optimal or perhaps he had been filing excessive claims that might have made him a less desirable client for the insurance company.\n\n\u201cIt was great for me,\u201d he replied. \u201cNever had an issue.\u201d\n\nWe also wondered if Greg \u201cOpie\u201d Hughes, the other half of the radio duo, was also facing a similar dilemma. Cumia wasn\u2019t sure. At the time of publication, Hughes had not responded to our inquiries.\n\n\u2013\n\nFollow Mike Opelka on Twitter -@Stuntbrain", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30; polling-uri=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/1.xml; polling-uri2=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/2.xml; polling-uri3=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/3.xml; polling-uri4=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/4.xml", "application-name": "TheBlaze.com", "twitter": {"description": "One of the biggest names in broadcasting has just joined the estimated 5.5 million people who lost medical insurance coverage due to new Obamacare regulations.
