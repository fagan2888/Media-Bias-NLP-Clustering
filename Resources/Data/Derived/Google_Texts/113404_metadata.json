Hoeber would not say she supported it; however, she said she stands by the current law, under which abortion is legal.\n\nMembers of the panel asked some candidates about whether they would make changes to institutions such as health care.\n\nA panelist asked Cheng whether he would propose legislation regarding Affordable Care Act, following a Congressional bill to repeal it.\n\nCheng, a physician, called the act a \u201cmess-up\u201d and said health care should be an agreement between the doctor and the patient.\n\nWith regard to immigration, Baker and Howard said they supported building a wall along the Mexican border, as presidential candidate Donald Trump has advocated.\n\nFicker and Painter answered a question about immigration. Ficker did not seem bothered by illegal immigration to the U.S.\n\n\u201cThere are millions of very bright people around the world who would make very fine Americans that could contribute to our society and bring jobs to Western Maryland , and I am all for\u2026 bringing those people to the United States,\u201d said Ficker.\n\nFicker compared the process of obtaining citizenship with getting married and paying taxes.\n\n\u201cIf people are here illegally, it\u2019s a legal process. You have to go through the legal process just like you do when you get married, just like paying taxes as a legal process for people to go through to become citizens, and I\u2019m for that. \u201c\n\nPainter, however, disagreed and said the topic is an issue that corresponds with his agenda.\n\n\u201cI think immigration is both a problem for national security and for what\u2019s, to be honest, my main agenda and that is restoring American economy and the working man to the middle class,\u201d said Painter.\n\nBaker said he thought some members of the Islamic State are in the U.S. and would support a war against ISIS.\n\nTrump said he thought all mosques should be closed. Baker did not agree.\n\n\u201cClosing, no,\u201d said Baker. \u201cNot at this time,\u201d because \u201cI\u2019m not so sure everyone that goes there is a terrorist.\u201d\n\nSome candidates said that other issues were more important to them than the environment and sustainable energy. A panelist asked Baker whether he thought climate change was the biggest threat to the nation.\n\nHe said \u201cgetting rid\u201d of terrorists is the nation\u2019s priority.\n\n\u201cThese terrorists out there, they want us dead,\u201d said Baker. \u201cThey hate us.\u201d\n\nA panelist asked Vogt if he supported the coal industry, and he said yes.\n\n\u201cOur Western Maryland population was built by coal,\u201d said Vogt. \u201cKilling industries like Senator Delaney has done with coal is absolutely deplorable.\u201d\n\nMason said he supported energy that was \u201ceconomically suitable\u201d and that would result in energy independence. He said he supported all types of energy, including coal and nuclear energy.\n\nCandidates\u2019 responses to questions on Delaney\u2019s stance on the Syrian refugee crisis came in varying levels of sentiment but for the most part did not encourage additional refugees due to distrust of the effectiveness of the vetting process for refugees.\n\nHoward echoed the governor\u2019s statement that allowing refugees in under a weak vetting process was a security risk.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s extraordinarily dangerous to let in Syrian refugees without proper vetting,\u201d said Howard.\n\nFollowing the debate, Hoeber said although she thought the vetting process was detailed, having background checks and multiple interviews, Syrian documents and records were not organized enough to be reliable sources of background information.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s absolutely impossible to do with the Syrian refugees that deployed here,\u201d said Hoeber. \u201cWe cannot vet their unconnection with terrorism. There isn\u2019t enough data of the society in Syria didn\u2019t keep their source of records. We wouldn\u2019t have access to those records even if (Syria) had kept (the records).\u201d\n\nHoward and Vogt and said they supported the governor\u2019s decisions about whether to allow Syrian refugees to live in the U.S. and about seeking a balanced budget.\n\nHoward said Hogan and other governors in the U.S. who do not support welcoming Syrian refugees were doing \u201cthe right thing.\u201d\n\nVogt said he agreed with Hogan\u2019s approach to seek a balanced budget. He added that Hogan had a strong command of the state\u2019s budget. He said the most recent budget was the strongest one yet.\n\n@kathleenstubbs3", "article_metadata": {"description": "GAITHERSBURG \u2014 Eight individuals running for Congress answered questions on topics such as national security, immigration and the Second Amendm...", "generator": "Joomla! - Open Source Content Management", "author": "Kathleen Stubbs", "og": {"url": "http://www.thesentinel.com/mont/newsx/local/item/2951-gop-candidates-debate-for-district-six-seat", "type": "article", "description": "GAITHERSBURG \u2014 Eight individuals running for Congress answered questions on topics such as national security, immigration and the Second Amendm...", "title": "GOP candidates debate for District Six seat"}, "title": "GOP candidates debate for District Six seat", "keywords": "Maryland,montgomery county,District 6,Congressional election,Republican", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe17c2\"", "article_summary": "\u201cI think it\u2019s absolutely impossible to do with the Syrian refugees that deployed here,\u201d said Hoeber.\nHoward echoed the governor\u2019s statement that allowing refugees in under a weak vetting process was a security risk.\n\u201cThey hate us.\u201dA panelist asked Vogt if he supported the coal industry, and he said yes.\nA panelist asked Baker whether he thought climate change was the biggest threat to the nation.\nWith regard to immigration, Baker and Howard said they supported building a wall along the Mexican border, as presidential candidate Donald Trump has advocated."}
