We'll discuss\u2014and you can, too, if you sign in -- ACA enrollment, premiums (are people paying them?), problems and glitches, demographics (what will happen to premiums next year since Ohioans who enrolled tended to be older) and so on.\n\nThe ACA is the law, an expansion of government now embedded in public policy. Like it or hate it -- but either way, some facts and answers will serve you better than political rhetoric. Joining the hour-long chat will be:\n\nKathleen Gmeiner, project director for the Universal Health Care Action Network of Ohio, a pro-ACA group. She was heavily involved in ACA enrollment efforts.\n\nMiranda Motter, president and CEO of the Ohio Association of Health Plans, which represents 14 health plans providing insurance to Ohioans. Not all of those plans chose to get involved in the ACA marketplace in Ohio.\n\nBishop Tony Minor, founder and senior pastor of the Community of Faith Assembly in Cleveland. He serves as the advocacy director at the Lutheran Metropolitan Ministry, one of the largest social service agencies in Greater Cleveland. He engaged African-American churches to counsel and help enroll people in individual ACA policies.\n\nLuke J. Clark, a senior consultant with Oswald Companies, a Cleveland-based insurance consultancy that works with businesses. The ACA's coverage requirements and taxes have created critics and worries among employers.\n\nCathy Allen, of Marblehead, who got health coverage through the ACA. President Barack Obama highlighted her story in 2011, with the White House saying that her systemic Lupus made it impossible to get insurance after she left her job and started a business as a consultant, even though she didn't require much medical care. The ACA enabled her to get in a high-risk insurance pool until she could buy a regular policy. Insurers are now barred from rejecting people with pre-existing conditions or charging them more.\n\nJoin this Plain Dealer chat on Cleveland.com at 11 a.m.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "affordable-care-act,kathleen-gmeiner,miranda-motter,mobile,obamacare,tony-minor", "title": "Join the discussion about Affordable Care Act: Live chat", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Join the discussion about Affordable Care Act: Live chat\", \"link\": \"http://www.cleveland.com/open/index.ssf/2014/05/join_the_online_chat_about_aff.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://imgick.cleveland.com/home/cleve-media/width620/img/cleveland-homepage-images/photo/14992375-standard.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"12976844\", \"pub_date\": \"2014-05-21T11:10:20Z\", \"author\": \"Stephen Koff, Northeast Ohio Media Group Washington Bureau Chief\", \"tags\": [\"affordable-care-act\",\"kathleen-gmeiner\",\"miranda-motter\",\"mobile\",\"obamacare\",\"tony-minor\"] }", "twitter": {"image": "http://media.cleveland.com/cleveland-homepage-images/photo/14992375-thumb_square_large.jpg", "creator": "@SteveKoff", "description": "Follow the chat, or join it, in the comments section beneath this story, from 11 a.m. until noon.", "card": "summary", "site": "@clevelanddotcom"}, "article_date_updated": "Wednesday, May 21, 2014, 10:36 AM", "parsely-metadata": "{\"image_url\": \"http://media.cleveland.com/cleveland-homepage-images/photo/healthcare-chat-promojpg-3e82fa6217259fb6.jpg\", \"author_name\": \"skoff\", \"author_nickname\": \"Stephen Koff, Northeast Ohio Media Group Washington Bureau Chief\", \"author_id\": \"2490\", \"source_blog_name\": \"OPEN: Ohio Politics\", \"source_blog_url\": \"http://www.cleveland.com/open/index.ssf/\", \"sponsored_content\": \"0\" }", "og": {"site_name": "cleveland.com", "description": "Follow the chat, or join it, in the comments section beneath this story, from 11 a.m. until noon.", "title": "Join the discussion about Affordable Care Act: Live chat", "url": "http://www.cleveland.com/open/index.ssf/2014/05/join_the_online_chat_about_aff.html", "image": "http://media.cleveland.com/design/alpha/img/logo_cleve.gif", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "cleveland.com", "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Wednesday, May 21, 2014,  7:00 AM", "article_author": "Stephen Koff, Northeast Ohio Media Group Washington Bureau Chief", "Description": "Follow the chat, or join it, in the comments section beneath this story, from 11 a.m. until noon."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbef0\"", "article_summary": "Joining the hour-long chat will be:Kathleen Gmeiner, project director for the Universal Health Care Action Network of Ohio, a pro-ACA group.\nMiranda Motter, president and CEO of the Ohio Association of Health Plans, which represents 14 health plans providing insurance to Ohioans.\nWe'll start at 11 a.m. and address lots of questions about the Affordable Care Act, or ACA.\nThe live chat starts at 11 a.m. in the comments section below.\nJoin this Plain Dealer chat on Cleveland.com at 11 a.m."}
