School is back in session and for the Kingsville ISD this means crunching numbers.

The school district is facing a 763-thousand dollar deficit.

We spoke with Brian Coufal School Board President , who says they took a big hit when the Affordable Care Act was put in place.

The District also increased teacher’s salaries to make sure they were competitive with surrounding districts.

An additional program added to the deficit, it was a new food program they started. The program is called Community Eligibility, it is a four year program that makes sure every child in the district gets free breakfast and lunch.

“We did not reach the 95 percent participation level to get 100 percent reimbursement,” says Coufal.

The closer they get to that number, the more money they will receive.

“The effect of not reaching 95 percent the district has to absorb a little bit of that cost. We believe its achievable and we are certainly going to make every effort to reach that this next year.”

The district won’t be doing anything about the deficit. They won’t ask for a tax increase and they will not be making any cuts. They just plan to absorb the deficit with their general fund balance.

Coufal says, “That’s why it doesn't concern me a whole lot to have an initial deficit of 750 thousand dollars because I know that our revenues are understated. And hopefully our expenditures are over stated.”

These are all preliminary tax figures that the district received and is based on the conservative enrollment. They know that new properties like apartments and homes have been added to Kingsville and they know this will be extra tax revenue for the district.

The fiscal year ends at the end of this month and they hope to have a more concrete number in September.
