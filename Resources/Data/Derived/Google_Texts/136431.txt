Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) contributed to the escalating rhetoric of American officials against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant Friday night, telling FOX News’ Greta van Susteren that there’s one message above all the United States should send to the fanatical terror group.

“The best way to send a message to ISIS is through ordinance dropped on their heads and blowing them to smithereens, blowing them straight to hell where they belong,” McCain declared.

ISIL was responsible for the recent execution of American journalist James Foley, which sparked a new round of dialogue about the country’s best policy against the group. McCain, the one-time Republican presidential nominee and prominent foreign-policy hawk, implored the president to develop one quickly.

“[I]f the president will develop a strategy, we will support it. So far, there is no strategy,” McCain said.
