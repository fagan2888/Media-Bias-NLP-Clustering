A protest movement in a small Mediterranean nation, Greece, threatens the whole European project, and a whole wave of leaderless protest movements throughout Europe in recent years still challenges the order. Middle Eastern and North African states remain in varying degrees of instability after the Arab Spring. The Green Revolution in Iran, though put down by authorities, might be seen to have turned that country toward a new moderation. Protest movements in Latin America in the 2000s have steered virtually the entire continent to the left and ended the hegemonic hold on the region by the U.S. since the Monroe Doctrine. Politicians in the United States now use the language of Occupy Wall Street, and just 4 years after the landmark protests, an Occupy-type candidate, the self-described democratic socialist Bernie Sanders, challenges Hillary Clinton in a way that would not have been conceivable before thousands of Americans took to the streets and occupied to call for an end to runaway economic inequality.\n\nIt seems that only an immense police state keeps a secure lid on things these days, as we see in places like China and Russia. But that strategy creates problems of its own. America\u2019s intensifying police-state experiment has made its largest cities into tinderboxes after decades of police violence and mass incarceration. The criminal justice system tasked with, in President Obama\u2019s words, \u201ccontaining and controlling problems\u201d of poverty and racial subjugation has potentially created a problem it can neither contain nor control.\n\nPhilosophers Michael Hardt and Antonio Negri wrote presciently about the current circumstance in their \u201cEmpire\u201d trilogy, whose first volume, \u201cEmpire,\u201d was published 15 years ago on the eve of President Bush\u2019s election. The book was a landmark in radical thought, leading Slavoj Zizek to offer that the two thinkers had \u201crewritten the Communist Manifesto for the 21st century.\u201d Hardt and Negri describe both the contemporary nature of power (corporations, police, surveillance, and debt) and the manner of resistance which has come to emerge in the years after \u201cEmpire\u2019s\u201d publication, what Hardt and Negri termed the \u201cmultitude,\u201d or resistance organizations composed of an array of struggles \u2014 economic, racial, gender, identity, and other modes of power and control. From the Arab Spring to resistance movements throughout Europe, Asia and Latin America to Occupy Wall Street and Black Lives Matter, nearly all theaters of resistance bear the mark of what Hardt and Negri describe in \u201cEmpire.\u201d\n\nI recently spoke with Dr. Hardt, comparative literature professor at Duke University, to talk about the 15 years of increasingly tumultuous times since Empire, and to consider the prospects for revolutionary change. The interview has been edited for clarity and length.\n\nIt\u2019s been 15 years since the publication of \u201cEmpire,\u201d and a lot of what you and Negri describe has come to pass. How do see the political and economic circumstance now versus when Empire was written?\n\nOne intuition we had when writing \u201cEmpire\u201d was that the U.S. is no longer able to rule the globe, that the U.S. is no longer an imperialist power in that sense. This is not to say that since the U.S. is in decline, now China or Europe is going to become the dominant power. The idea instead is that the global order has shifted, or is in the process of shifting, such that nation-states, even the most powerful ones, are no longer able to rule as they had previously. And that\u2019s really what we meant by \u201cEmpire,\u201d not that nation-states no longer matter \u2014 they certainly do \u2014 but rather that they now have to fit within a larger structure, a kind of \u201cnetwork\u201d of powers, including global institutions, such as the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, the set of dominant nation-states, sub-national forces, non-state actors, and a whole array of other powers.\n\nDuring the period following September 11th the Bush administration seemed intent on proving this idea wrong: They thought they could rule the world unilaterally and that the U.S. is still a properly imperialist power. But it didn\u2019t take long, with the U.S. failures in Iraq and Afghanistan, for those dreams of imperialist grandeur to evaporate.\n\nOur argument about national sovereignty was thus, first of all, descriptive, particularly with regard to the dominant nation-states. But it was also prescriptive with respect to liberation movements. Gone are the days when national liberation aimed at sovereignty was the appropriate goal. Instead liberation today has to be conceived and achieved in terms of circuits of autonomy and interdependence, democracy and cooperation.\n\nHow do you see the last 4 or 5 years of resistance and revolutionary movements, from the Arab Spring to Occupy Wall Street to the Black Lives Matter movement, and how these recent struggles connect?\n\nWhen we were writing Empire, in the mid-1990s, we were inspired by many movements, such as ACT UP and Queer Nation in the US, the Zapatista Rebellion in Mexico, the June 4th Movement at Tiananmen Square, and the 1995 labor strikes in France. But those movements didn\u2019t communicate with each other, they didn\u2019t form a cycle, but instead seemed to point in different directions. In the last 15 years, in contrast, it is remarkable how strongly the movements communicate and resonate with each other, how they share common practices and aspirations.\n\nOne shared aspect of the most powerful movements of recent years is a questioning or even refusal of centralized leadership and hierarchy. You might date this practice in its current form with the Zapatista rebellion or the alter-globalization movement, and it is certainly a central figure of the cycle of struggles that began in 2011, from the various encampments around the Mediterranean to Occupy, to Turkey and Brazil. These movements share a highly developed immune system with powerful antibodies: When any form of centralized leadership emerges, they attack it.\n\nThat\u2019s a really positive development. One concern we need to confront, though, is that the refusal of leadership is not translated into a refusal of organization. We need to avoid that a healthy antibody response doesn\u2019t turn into an autoimmune disorder. We have to recognize the possibility of democratic organizing that don\u2019t rely on traditional forms of centralized leadership, such as the vanguard party, the charismatic male leader, the central committee, and so forth. So I think in all of these movements, and including Black Lives Matter, we\u2019re faced with that challenge: How to find forms of organization that are lasting and effective without resorting to the traditional hierarchical, centralized forms of leadership that we hate \u2014 and for good reason.\n\nThat relates to what Toni and I were trying to capture with the notion of \u201cmultitude.\u201d On the one hand, multitude is meant to emphasize the plural and democratic nature of the liberation movements, against traditional notions of \u201cthe people\u201d and various other unified identities. On the other hand, however, \u201cmultitude\u201d names a project that requires organization; it\u2019s not something spontaneous or immediate. That characterizes, I think, the struggles we\u2019ve seen and will continue to see, but also defines a challenge they face.\n\nAn aspect that characterizes the cycles of struggles at least since 2011 is that they insist on the right to the city as a common space. The various encampments in Tunisia, Egypt, Spain, Greece, the U.S., Turkey, and Brazil \u2014 and I\u2019m undoubtedly leaving some out \u2014 as well as the protests of Black Lives Matter, all challenge the exclusion from urban space, whether by forms of privatization, or by the police, or by structures of racial segregation. What\u2019s affirmed in all these movements, of course in different ways and in response to different national and regional contexts, is that the urban space must become common, must become open to equal access and become managed by democratic structures.\n\nBlack Lives Matter certainly fits as part of this global cycle of struggles, especially when you focus on how, like the other struggles, it is protesting the effects of economic austerity. One way in which Black Lives Matter is really different, however, especially when thinking about the U.S., and this is one of the most important things about it in my view, is that for the first time in a long time, people of color are at the center of the movement. Throughout the alter-globalization movements in North America and in Occupy too, most of the activists involved recognized racial inequality in the U.S. as a central problem they face, and wanted their struggles to include people of color, but people of color, even when they participated, were not at the center of the movements. Of course, there aren\u2019t just people of color involved in Black Lives Matter, sometimes not even a majority, but maybe not since the 1960s has there been such an important and large movement in the U.S. with people of color at the center of the organizing.\n\nAfter decades of decline in the strength of labor in the U.S., we\u2019re seeing an emergence of a new wave of struggles, most visibly in fast food, Walmart, and other formerly non-organized sectors. How do see the prospects for organizing labor in the 21st century?\n\nIt\u2019s useful to sometimes back up when thinking about class and working class politics to investigate first what labor means today and not assume that labor and the working class itself means the same thing as it did 20 or 50 years ago. The decline of the centrality of the factory and factory labor in the U.S. and other dominant parts of the world, doesn\u2019t mean a decline of labor or of the working class, but instead a shift to different forms of labor. To think today about working class movements one has to conduct first an investigation of the composition of the working class today, to investigate, in other words, what people do at work. That\u2019s the basis on which organizing is possible.\n\nIn some ways the mechanisms and structures for organizing an industrial working class were relatively straightforward compared to the challenges of organizing workers that, like you said, are involved in different sorts of tasks. Toni and I in \u201cEmpire\u201d used the term \u201cimmaterial production,\u201d which is a kind of shorthand meant to focus on the kinds of labor that produce commodities that are, at least in part, immaterial. We meant to contrast the production of durable goods \u2014 an automobile or a washing machine \u2014 with the production of ideas or images or affects, like you said, or code. These kinds of labor require different forms of organizing and political structures, and I think we\u2019re only halfway in the process of understanding how these forms of labor can be organized effectively for political action.\n\nThis is another advantage of the term \u201cmultitude,\u201d in our view. The laboring multitude is not negation of the traditional term \u201cworking class,\u201d but an effort to rethink it not as a unified subject but as the composition of a wide multiplicity. Put another way, and rather reductively, we cannot understand the male, white, factory worker today as the representative figure of the working class, but must instead try to grasp the links and alliances among the plural subjectivities of social production and reproduction.\n\nIt might be useful today to conceive of labor organizing in terms of social unionism (or social movement unionism), which has a long tradition in North American, Britain, and South Africa. The point, however, is not to think of an external alliance between a labor union and a social movement \u2014 such as, for example, the inspiring link in 1997 between the Liverpool dockers and Reclaim the Streets. We need instead to understand the connection internally: Labor organizing must adopt some of the practices and aspirations of social movements and, in turn, movements must pose labor at the center of organizing discussions.\n\nYou and Negri presciently described the leaderless nature of these movements of the multitude. It means they\u2019re more democratic and allow for more voices, but it\u2019s also frustrated observers and even participants. How do leaderless movements retain democracy while also being effective?\n\nThis is one way to address the problem I mentioned earlier and the need to combine the critique of centralized leadership and the need for organizing. We often seem to get stuck in a false [dilemma]: Either our movements can be beautiful and democratic and participatory, but that implies being ineffective and short-lasting; or they retreat to traditional forms of hierarchical and centralized leadership, which promise to be powerful and long-lasting, but betray our democratic aspirations. This kind of thinking assumes a standard division of labor, in revolutionary, progressive, and liberal organizing whereby centralized leadership is responsible for strategy (for understanding the general situation, evaluating the relations of force, making long-term goals, and maintaining continuous actions); whereas tactics (immediate actions that are partial and short-sighted) are the terrain of the popular masses.\n\nIt is helpful to invert this framework and ask what [if it is] necessary to confine leadership to tactics and give the multitude the strategic role. What would it take for activists together to become capable of generating a long-term and lasting vision and overall goals, conducting effective action? And how could leadership be deployed for limited, specific tasks and then dismissed. You might say that forms of leadership need to be subordinated to the multitude.\n\nThis inversion, it opens a lot of questions, too. But at least it\u2019s an initial framework for starting to think differently about organization and leadership.\n\nDo you see any examples of this new kind of inversion?\n\nLet\u2019s approach this from both sides. On one side, one could start by recognizing the strategic capacities that are already generated collectively within social movements and also, perhaps more importantly, thinking of what kinds of trainings or pedagogies would be necessary to develop further these strategic capacities. On the other side, we might use this framework of an inversion of strategy and tactics as a means to evaluate a number of party formations that have emerged from movements, such as the MAS in Bolivia, Syriza in Greece, and Podemos in Spain. How can these leadership structures be brought back and held firmly under the control of the movements? The extent to which they are, let\u2019s say, a party of the movements, I think could be judged in this framework\u2014in other words, the extent to which instead of the party or the leadership claiming to represent or to direct the actions of the multitude, leadership is merely the instrument of the movements themselves. Perhaps these various examples are just a first approximation of what an inversion of strategy and tactics could mean.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Salon talks to philosopher Michael Hardt about how new forms of social movements can make a difference", "title": "The American empire is fading out: #BlackLivesMatter, Bernie Sanders & the secrets to a better tomorrow", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Salon talks to philosopher Michael Hardt about how new forms of social movements can make a difference", "title": "The American empire is fading out: #BlackLivesMatter, Bernie Sanders & the secrets to a better tomorrow", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/07/26/the_american_empire_is_fading_out_these_are_the_biggest_challenges_to_creating_better_future/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/07/bush_hillary.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Salon talks to philosopher Michael Hardt about how new forms of social movements can make a difference", "title": "The American empire is fading out: #BlackLivesMatter, Bernie Sanders & the secrets to a better tomorrow", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/07/bush_hillary.jpg", "creator": "@https://twitter.com/mattpulver", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Matthew Pulver", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, black lives matter, Capitalism, Occupy Wall Street, Radicalism", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd2cd\"", "article_summary": "To think today about working class movements one has to conduct first an investigation of the composition of the working class today, to investigate, in other words, what people do at work.\nHow do see the prospects for organizing labor in the 21st century?\nIt might be useful today to conceive of labor organizing in terms of social unionism (or social movement unionism), which has a long tradition in North American, Britain, and South Africa.\nIt\u2019s been 15 years since the publication of \u201cEmpire,\u201d and a lot of what you and Negri describe has come to pass.\nIt\u2019s useful to sometimes back up when thinking about class and working class politics to investigate first what labor means today and not assume that labor and the working class itself means the same thing as it did 20 or 50 years ago."}
