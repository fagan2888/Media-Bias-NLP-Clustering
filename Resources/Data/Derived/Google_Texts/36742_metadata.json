The state will need to ask for a renewal this year if it wants that money once the funds\u2019 authorization expires in September 2016. And there\u2019s no guarantee Texas will be given more money.\n\nThe saga of the Texas Healthcare Transformation and Quality Improvement Program has incensed politicians, triggered nervousness in providers, and now has once again sparked a standoff of sorts between Texas and the Obama administration. Known technically as the Medicaid 1115 waiver\u2014its name derives from Section 1115 of the Social Security Act that birthed it and its cousins in other states\u2014the pot of money worth $29 billion was meant to offset the cost of uncompensated care and reform the way healthcare is delivered to Medicaid enrollees and the uninsured in Texas.\n\nApproved by the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services in 2011, the 1115 waiver created two pools of money. One goes toward paying for indigent care. The other pays for providers to create and implement programs that will keep poor people healthier and out of the ER. It hasn\u2019t been without controversy, though. Especially in North Texas, which has pockets where the uninsured rate flirts with 40 percent.\n\nYou aren\u2019t remiss if you\u2019re not familiar with the waiver. Since the U.S. Supreme Court ruling in 2012 that gave states the choice to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, Texas lawmakers have shouted their refusal to do so at such a volume that it has filled the echo chamber where healthcare and politics intersect. There\u2019s hardly room for anything else.\n\nThe waiver was originally OK\u2019d to help Texas weather increased capacity for Medicaid patients once the Affordable Care Act became law. But the high court\u2019s ruling essentially made that moot, given Texas\u2019 refusal to expand Medicaid. Instead, the 1115 waiver now has been helping hospitals offset sagging Medicaid reimbursement rates. According to the Texas Hospital Association, the Medicaid program reimburses providers 50 cents on the dollar for inpatient services and 72 cents for outpatient.\n\n\u201cThe 1115 waiver is incredibly important to Texas hospitals,\u201d says Erol Akdamar, president of HCA North Texas, which counts 15 area hospitals in its portfolio. \u201cWe\u2019re reimbursed roughly half of the Medicaid cost for inpatient care. The waiver provides some funding that is a supplement to the initial reimbursement.\u201d\n\nThe money doesn\u2019t completely come from CMS. The waiver mandates that local governments put skin in the game by ponying up a portion of their own money, which the feds return and match at 60 percent. As a result, about $17 billion of the $29 billion came from CMS. And about $2.3 billion of that has poured into the Dallas area.\n\nThe one pool for treating the uninsured\u2014coined UC for Uncompensated Care\u2014dwindles as the years progress. The other pool for the reform programs\u2014coined DSRIP, for Delivery System Reform Incentive Programs\u2014is heavier on the back-end. The idea is that poorer populations shouldn\u2019t be receiving as much uncompensated care if the DSRIP projects are successful. Region 9, which includes Dallas County, has 131 active projects. They\u2019ve birthed new clinics, paid salaries for specialists in underserved areas, and funded partnerships with providers and community groups.\n\nThis story originally appeared in the July-August issue of D CEO.
