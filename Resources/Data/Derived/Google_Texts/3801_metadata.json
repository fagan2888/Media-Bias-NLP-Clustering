That's when the program's health insurance marketplace will go live. Individuals can then shop for health insurance, much like they shop for hotels and airfare on the web. They can compare plans, costs and buy the type of insurance they need.\n\n\"Our health department will take the lead,\" said Cleveland Mayor Frank Jackson when asked about how Cleveland residents can get answers about the new program. But Jackson admitted that the city's health department will likely pass people with Obamacare questions off onto a local health care agency.\n\nWithout satisfactory answers from the city or county, NewsChannel5 asked Ohio Gov. John Kasich how his office is helping residents. His response:\n\n\"They can call over to the Department of Insurance and get their questions answered,\" Kasich said.\n\nFor more information:\n\nwww.healthcare.gov or 1-800-318-2596\n\nCuyahoga County Department of Job & Family Services: 216-987-7000\n\nCleveland Department of Public Health: 216-664-2324\n\nOhio Department of Insurance: 614-644-2658", "article_metadata": {"isStory": "true", "isPremium": "false", "description": "State and local lawmakers didn\u2019t have much guidance to give their constituents Tuesday when asked about the Affordable Care Act.", "author": "Kristin Volk, newsnet5.com", "og": {"site_name": "newsnet5", "description": "State and local lawmakers didn\u2019t have much guidance to give their constituents Tuesday when asked about the Affordable Care Act.", "title": "Cleveland, Cuyahoga County and Ohio officials defer Affordable Care Act/Obamacare questions", "url": "http://www.newsnet5.com/news/local-news/oh-cuyahoga/cleveland-cuyahoga-county-and-ohio-officials-defer-affordable-care-actobamacare-questions", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media2.newsnet5.com//photo/2013/09/24/Volk_Leaders_on_Obamacare_946960000_20130924185423_640_480.JPG", "height": 480}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"app": {"id": {"ipad": 481449100, "iphone": 487296004}}, "site": "@wews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "shortHeadline": "Lawmakers pass buck on Obamacare", "com.silverpop.brandeddomains": "www.pages03.net,scripps.mkt7057.com,www.newsnet5.com,recp.mkt32.net", "hasVideo": "true", "fb": {"app_id": 117981068372285}, "idio": {"hasVideo": "true", "isPremium": "false", "author": "Kristin Volk, newsnet5.com"}, "keywords": "local news, cuyahoga county,", "google-site-verification": "DiabNvdHVXRDa2QCnoOOtjKaIvq8CtH1446fPeFerd0", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/WEWS5", "section": "OH Cuyahoga", "tag": "cuyahoga, obamacare, kristinvolk, affordablecareact", "published_time": "2013-09-24T23:04:26+0000", "modified_time": "2013-09-24T23:06:36+0000"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, target-densitydpi=device-dpi, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc965d\"", "article_summary": "For more information:www.healthcare.gov or 1-800-318-2596Cuyahoga County Department of Job & Family Services: 216-987-7000Cleveland Department of Public Health: 216-664-2324Ohio Department of Insurance: 614-644-2658\nBut Jackson admitted that the city's health department will likely pass people with Obamacare questions off onto a local health care agency.\nFitzgerald encouraged county residents to call the Department of Job and Family Services for any questions regarding the federal government's program.\n\"Our health department will take the lead,\" said Cleveland Mayor Frank Jackson when asked about how Cleveland residents can get answers about the new program.\nIndividuals can then shop for health insurance, much like they shop for hotels and airfare on the web."}
