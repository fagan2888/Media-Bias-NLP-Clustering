This \u201cworkaround\u201d is needed because the Obamacare payment system isn\u2019t working properly.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re touting this improved Healthcare.gov,\u201d a befuddled Kelly began. \u201cHow does the system work without a payment mechanism? There is no cash register!\u201d\n\nReuters has the \u201cbombshell\u201d report on the new \u201cworkaround\u201d:\n\nThe administration is planning a \u201cworkaround\u201d for payments, said Daniel Durham, vice president for policy and regulatory affairs at America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans. Health plans will estimate how much they are owed, and submit that estimate to the government. Once the system is built, the government and insurers can reconcile the payments made with the plan data to \u201ctrue up\u201d payments, he said. \u201cThe intent is to make sure plans get paid on time, which is a good thing,\u201d Durham told Reuters. The fix puts an additional \u201cburden\u201d on insurance companies, already taxed by having to double-check faulty enrollment data from the HealthCare.gov system.\n\nKelly was shocked that the administration would \u201clet the insurance companies estimate what they should get.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen the feds are going to cut them a big check and figure out later what the real amounts are supposed to be! That\u2019s your money!\u201d she added. \u201cThink about that for a moment. Think about that. We\u2019re talking about one-sixth of the U.S. economy and this is the system that they have now settled on.\u201d\n\nKelly went on to remind viewers that President Barack Obama on Tuesday assured the American people that Obamacare is \u201cworking and will continue working in the future.\u201d\n\n(H/T: Mediaite)\n\n\u2013", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30; polling-uri=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/1.xml; polling-uri2=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/2.xml; polling-uri3=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/3.xml; polling-uri4=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/4.xml", "application-name": "TheBlaze.com", "twitter": {"description": "The Obama administration is reportedly preparing to implement a \"workaround\" that instructs insurers to \"estimate\" the cost of health care plans and the government will determine the actual costs later, Reuters reports.
