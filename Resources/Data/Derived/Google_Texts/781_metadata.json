But what about big data\u2019s potential power in tackling patient safety issues?\n\nBoston Children\u2019s Hospital has teamed with the nonprofit, federally funded MITRE Corp. research center, to answer that question. The two are pulling together data from multiple sources \u2014 electronic health records, safety event reports, physiologic monitors, etc. \u2014 to gain insights into what may have caused patient harm. They\u2019re now folding in two more children\u2019s hospitals, and hope the effort will continue to snowball, says Laura Wood, R.N., senior vice president of patient care services and chief nursing officer.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a significant opportunity to apply big data analytics to reduce preventable harm in health care,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s a complex undertaking, but we think we\u2019ve already demonstrated that there\u2019s value and potential to gain insights that one couldn\u2019t otherwise gain around pattern recognition and opportunities to reduce harm.\u201d\n\nThe MITRE Corp. previously performed similar analysis in conjunction with the airline industry through the FAA Aviation Safety Information Analysis and Sharing system, now comprising 121 air carriers and 185 data sources.\n\nThe National Patient Safety Partnership, organized by MITRE, aims to replicate that success. The partnership initially focused on two key patient safety concerns \u2014 alarm fatigue and medication safety.\n\nThe alarm project concluded in August while medication safety is still ongoing. A few key insights from the alarm project included the fact that 85 percent of alarms were yellow or low priority, and 60 percent were for patients at a low-acuity level. From that, Boston Children\u2019s removed some patients who were unnecessarily still being monitored, and it\u2019s recalibrated the thresholds that require action on alarms.\n\nUp next, the NPSP will tap into data to predict when a patient\u2019s condition is deteriorating. Cincinnati Children\u2019s Hospital Medical Center and Children\u2019s National Health System, Washington, D.C., also are in the partnership.\n\nEric Hughes, chief architect of data analytics solutions at MITRE, is unsure whether they\u2019ll continue to add hospitals into the collaboration, but he thinks the early results show promise for its future.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a trivial thing to bring together these diverse types of data to address these kinds of questions, but we think there\u2019s some evidence that it\u2019s worthwhile to pursue,\u201d he says.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Hospitals across the country are attempting to harness troves of data to try and predict risk and better treat the health of patient populations.
