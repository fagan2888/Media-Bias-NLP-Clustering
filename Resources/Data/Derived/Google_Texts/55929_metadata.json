She says her younger brother tried twice to sign up online before he gave up.\n\n\u201cCurrently the process is very unclear, it\u2019s hard to navigate, and it\u2019s not very accessible,\u201d she said.\n\nFor most young people, The Affordable Care Act allows them to stay on their parents\u2019 insurance until they turn 26. But when California foster youth age out of the system between ages 18 and 21, they often have no one. So federal lawmakers added a special provision to the health law that allows these young adults to stay on Medicaid \u2014 called Medi-Cal in California \u2014 until age 26, regardless of their income.\n\n\u201cFormer foster youth are extremely vulnerable,\u201d says Jessica Haspel a policy associate at the advocacy nonprofit Children Now. She says any obstacles or delays to enrollment are especially problematic for foster youth. Many have special health needs stemming from a history of abuse or neglect and may rely on important medication for things like diabetes or anxiety. Studies show nearly one in three former foster youth exhibit signs of post-traumatic stress disorder \u2014 which is itself about twice the rate of American war veterans.\n\n\u201cThey may have been offered counseling when they were a child, but were not in a position where they were really able or ready to process it,\u201d Haspel says. \u201cAs an adult, they want to take advantage of counseling and services to help them deal with everything that they\u2019ve been through.\u201d\n\nShe says the Covered California website isn\u2019t programmed properly to enroll former foster youth into coverage. And call center employees aren\u2019t educated about the new provision. As a result, some youth are being told they don\u2019t qualify when they do, or they are put in a queue when they should be fast-tracked into coverage.\n\n\u201cWe are constantly working hard to resolve some of those issues,\u201d says Anne Gonzales, Covered California spokesperson.\n\nShe says the agency is beefing up training and updating its guide for service center reps. Website fixes are scheduled for the winter.\n\n\u201cWe are currently urging anyone who thinks they missed out on benefits to sign up now,\u201d she says.\n\nBut youth advocates are advising young people to sidestep Covered California altogether, and to go to their county social services office instead to sign up for Medi-Cal in person.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Former foster youth are eligible for Medi-Cal until age 26, regardless of income.", "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"Critics Say Covered California Ill-Equipped to Help Former Foster Youth\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/2014\\/07\\/24\\/critics-say-covered-california-ill-equipped-to-help-former-foster-youth\\/\",\"pub_date\":\"2014-07-24 09:22:43\",\"mod_date\":\"2014-07-24 17:37:57\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":20245,\"author_id\":\"3205\",\"author_name\":\"April Dembosky\",\"author_display_name\":\"April Dembosky\",\"tags\":[\"Covered California\"],\"categories\":[\"Community Health\",\"Obamacare\"],\"image\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/sites\\/27\\/2013\\/10\\/coveredca.jpg\"}", "og": {"site_name": "State of Health", "description": "Former foster youth are eligible for Medi-Cal until age 26, regardless of income.", "title": "Critics Say Covered California Ill-Equipped to Help Former Foster Youth", "url": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/2014/07/24/critics-say-covered-california-ill-equipped-to-help-former-foster-youth/", "image": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/wp-content/uploads/sites/27/2013/10/coveredca.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@kqedhealth", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@"}, "fb": {"app_id": 160023622793}, "keywords": "covered california", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcde2a\"", "article_summary": "But when California foster youth age out of the system between ages 18 and 21, they often have no one.\n\u201cFormer foster youth are extremely vulnerable,\u201d says Jessica Haspel a policy associate at the advocacy nonprofit Children Now.\n\u201cWe are constantly working hard to resolve some of those issues,\u201d says Anne Gonzales, Covered California spokesperson.\nShe says any obstacles or delays to enrollment are especially problematic for foster youth.\n\u201cAs an adult, they want to take advantage of counseling and services to help them deal with everything that they\u2019ve been through.\u201dShe says the Covered California website isn\u2019t programmed properly to enroll former foster youth into coverage."}
