Some of the arguments in favor include:\n\nBenefit to the environment \u2014 Employees aren\u2019t commuting as much, which typically involves public transportation or driving. A book by experts from the New Economics Foundation, called \u201cTime on Our Side,\u201d argues that a 30-hour work week would reduce greenhouse gas emissions, helping the planet.\n\nEmployees aren\u2019t commuting as much, which typically involves public transportation or driving.

Reduction of emotional and physical stress \u2014 A shorter week for workers would allow them more time to rest and recharge.\n\nA shorter week for workers would allow them more time to rest and recharge.

Contributions to society in other ways \u2014 A shorter work week would give employees time to volunteer or take classes that make them more productive in the long run.\n\nOther nations are more productive than the U.S. with shorter work weeks, some contend. The German economy is famously robust, but workers only put in an average of 35 hours a week.\n\nHere are a few other things to consider, though:\n\nFor retail businesses or small businesses with specific customer support hours, it may be difficult to cut back on hours and still satisfy customer needs.\n\nA 30-hour work week may not be welcomed by hourly workers who are paid by the hour and need the extra income from working 40 hours. It\u2019s more of a perk for salaried workers, especially in knowledge industries, who often put in 50, 60 or more hours per week.\n\nCutting to a 30 hour work week won\u2019t allow your business to reduce benefits or healthcare in most cases. Full-time under the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) is defined as any employee who works 30 or more hours on average per week.\n\nA 30-hour work week is obviously easier to implement in a huge corporation with lots of employees to fill in the vacated hours. For small businesses with only a few employees, it\u2019s a bit more challenging.\n\nHow can a small business owner implement a 30-hour work week? Here are some ideas:\n\nGive everyone the same day or days off \u2014 The most obvious solution is to implement a 4-day, 7.5-hour schedule for all employees. Give people the day off that\u2019s typically slowest for your business.\n\nThe most obvious solution is to implement a 4-day, 7.5-hour schedule for all employees. Give people the day off that\u2019s typically slowest for your business. Rotate days off \u2014 If you can\u2019t have your entire office closed on certain days, create a schedule that provides enough coverage to handle work each day while still giving every employee one day a week off.\n\nIf you can\u2019t have your entire office closed on certain days, create a schedule that provides enough coverage to handle work each day while still giving every employee one day a week off. Use a seasonal approach \u2014 Implement a 30-hour work week during slower times of year and a 40-hour work week during busier times.\n\nImplement a 30-hour work week during slower times of year and a 40-hour work week during busier times. Set up a work-from-home system \u2014 Employees would be in the office 30 hours per week and can work at home the other day. This isn\u2019t a true 30-hour work week, but does provide more flexibility.\n\nEmployees would be in the office 30 hours per week and can work at home the other day. This isn\u2019t a true 30-hour work week, but does provide more flexibility. Set workplace quotas \u2014 Instead of measuring hours, measure output. Require employees to get a certain amount of work done, ideally in 30 hours. If they can\u2019t complete it, they\u2019ll need to work longer, but the possibility of a shorter work week is highly motivating. You\u2019ll need to make sure the quality of work doesn\u2019t suffer.\n\nWhile a 30-hour work week may not be realistic for you, the business owner, you might find that being at the office 30 hours and spending more time away improves your results. Even if you are working, you\u2019ll be able to focus better and strategize the big picture. You won\u2019t be putting out fires all day long or interrupted by employees.\n\nAn alternative to the 30-hour work week is the 10/40 system. Under this system, employees work 10 hours a day, four days a week. Although it means longer workdays, many employees find the day off is worth the trade.\n\nTreating employees well makes your business a better place to work, makes your employees more energetic, and helps you attract and keep workers.\n\nSometimes, you really can get more from less.", "article_metadata": {"description": "There\u2019s a movement afoot to shorten the traditional 40-hour full-time work week to a 30 hour work week.
