This change will affect mobile searches in all languages worldwide and will have a significant impact in our search results. Consequently, users will find it easier to get relevant, high quality search results that are optimized for their devices.\n\nIn addition, Google said that apps indexed by Google via App Indexing will rank better in mobile search. For now, this will only be true for Android apps.\n\nTo determine if your website is already mobile-friendly \u2014 and thus ready for this algorithm update \u2014 you can use Google\u2019s mobile-friendly test. Just click on the link, enter your website and the analysis will be performed immediately.\n\nIf your website comes up as not mobile-friendly, talk to your website designer/developer about converting it by the April 21 deadline. It is now clear that those law firm websites that are not optimized for mobile will appear lower in search results beginning April 21.\n\nGoogle rarely gives businesses an opportunity to protect their search ranking prior to an algorithm update. You now have fair warning, which I encourage you to heed.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Google has announced that it will be changing its algorithm to use more mobile-friendly factors in its mobile search results", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"site_name": "The National Law Review", "description": "Google has announced that it will be changing its algorithm to use more mobile-friendly factors in its mobile search results on April 21, 2015, so if your site is not currently optimized for mobile de", "title": "Mobile-Friendly Sites to Rank Better on Google Starting April 21", "url": "http://www.natlawreview.com/article/mobile-friendly-sites-to-rank-better-google-starting-april-21", "image": "http://www.natlawreview.com/sites/default/files/styles/thumbnail/public/article/aux/1141/Network%20Phone%20Map_0.jpg?itok=0dDuK2Jj", "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Legal, Business, Companies, Technology, Internet, Mobile, Google,", "msvalidate.01": "5493B547C0AB527FF4CF8C4D0127302A", "google-site-verification": "SAKcOmA6_i0E79oG2TjlPWfOSs9kMM6EWAZNaT0aBtA", "verify-v1": "nSkrvEqyOIUMGKMak3OBIKcpcABac4XWK5NJKMuMtBY=", "y_key": "fe6cd8bd83ff0c09", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Legal, Business, Companies, Technology, Internet, Mobile, Google,"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc239\"", "article_summary": "In addition, Google said that apps indexed by Google via App Indexing will rank better in mobile search.\nAccording to the Google announcement:Starting April 21, we will be expanding our use of mobile-friendliness as a ranking signal.\nThis change will affect mobile searches in all languages worldwide and will have a significant impact in our search results.\nGoogle rarely gives businesses an opportunity to protect their search ranking prior to an algorithm update.\nConsequently, users will find it easier to get relevant, high quality search results that are optimized for their devices."}
