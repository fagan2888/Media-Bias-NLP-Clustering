And the new clinic will be no exception. The 12,000-square-foot Ruffin Family Clinic is scheduled to open mid-2015 near the corner of Martin Luther King Boulevard and Madison Avenue. Many of its offerings are provided by businesses such as Quest, CPL Laboratories and Steinberg Diagnostic.\n\nBeyond testing, Volunteers in Medicine offers those with diabetes, hypertension and other chronic conditions medications through its own dispensary. Medications valued at more than $2 million are offered through national drug companies each year, Jameson said.\n\nVolunteers in Medicine was formed in 2008 and its first location opened two years later. That location serves about 2,200 patients and is sustained by nearly $4 million in donations, including both financial and service-related gifts.\n\nThe new building will cost the organization $1.8 million and it is fully funded through donations. A groundbreaking event was Oct. 3 at 1240 N. Martin Luther King Blvd.\n\nJameson said Phil Ruffin, owner of the Treasure Island, and his wife, Alexandra, were responsible for the final leg of the fundraising for the building, which will be known as the Ruffin Family Clinic. The couple donated $300,000.\n\nAnother donor, Aurora Wong, creator of HepBFreeLasVegas, said she has also made sizable donations to the organization. But her involvement is a partnership in a way.\n\n\u201cFlorence and Volunteers in Medicine are in my linkage to care network,\u201d Wong said. \u201cThey manage and treat chronic hepatitis B for all of my uninsured clients who test positive.\u201d\n\nHer HepBFreeLasVegas organization helps people who are at risk for infection \u2014 a large category that includes recent immigrants from most of Asia, parts of Eastern Europe and western sub-Saharan countries.\n\n\u201cPeople who were born in those countries experience chronic hepatitis B infections at a much higher rate than the general population,\u201d Wong said.\n\nShe has sent as about 40 patients to Volunteers in Medicine, she said. And each patient\u2019s cost of care is around $1,000 per month.\n\nWong gives many reasons for her investment including the organization\u2019s businesslike structure, its ability to maintain that structure and its treatment of the clientele.\n\nBut Wong also has another reason as well.\n\n\u201cOn a spiritual level, I am investing in Florence\u2019s passion. And the reason is because her passion is informed by a very deep sense of compassion and social justice. Medical access for her is a right,\u201d Wong said.\n\nJameson says that the structure of her business has changed in recent times. Since the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, she said, her client list has gotten shorter, but not by much \u2014 she was up to 2,600 patients before the act was implemented and knocked down to 2,200 afterward.\n\nThere is still a barrier for some in going down the path to insurance or Medicaid. There are still 300,000 without insurance in Nevada right now, Jameson said.\n\nHer clinic has guidelines as to who it accepts as a patient.\n\n\u201cEverybody who can not get on Medicaid or a qualified health plan, a lot of them are between 178 and 200 percent of the poverty line. The working economically challenged. Those are the people who Volunteers in Medicine will take care of,\u201d Jameson said.\n\nMost of the patients who are at these income levels struggle with affording any insurance through the Nevada Exchange, but many also don\u2019t qualify for Medicaid.\n\nJameson said there may be times when people could be without insurance because they\u2019ve lost their job. The clinic can fill that in-between time.\n\nJameson projects the client load will grow sharply in her downtown clinic: from 3,000 during the first year to 20,000 after the fifth year of operation.\n\nThe new location will supply many of the same services \u2014 blood work, X-rays, medications and cancer screening \u2014 but will add mental health, vision and dental services.\n\nJameson said mental health is not a topic that is addressed enough in Nevada, and she intends to do something about it.\n\n\u201cWe are going to be setting up mental health social services and networking with other people in our community to try to take care of people who have these issues,\u201d she said.\n\nShe also sees a big need for dental care coverage in the downtown area. \u201cMost people aren\u2019t going to spend their last dollar on dental care,\u201d Jameson said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Community collaboration will be the key to success for an ambitious plan to expand free clinic services to downtown Las Vegas, according to the leader of the nonprofit organization leading the effort.", "parsely-tags": "Business Press,Business", "parsely-link": "http://www.reviewjournal.com/business/business-press/clinic-makes-its-mission-serve-those-need", "vf": {"unique_id": "reviewjournal-nid-1940331"}, "author": "JEFFREY MEEHAN Special to the Las Vegas Business Press", "parsely-title": "Clinic makes its mission to serve those in need", "twitter": {"description": "Community collaboration will be the key to success for an ambitious plan to expand free clinic services to downtown Las Vegas, according to the leader of the nonprofit organization leading the effort.", "title": "Clinic makes its mission to serve those in need", "url": "http://www.reviewjournal.com/business/business-press/clinic-makes-its-mission-serve-those-need", "image": {"src": "http://www.reviewjournal.com/sites/default/files/field/media/web1_copy_BP-VILLAGE-MED_092914ev_005_0.jpg, http://www.reviewjournal.com/sites/default/files/field/media/web1_BP-VILLAGE-MED_092914ev_001_0.jpg, http://www.reviewjournal.com/sites/default/files/field/media/web1_BP-VILLAGE-MED_092914ev_003_0.jpg, http://www.reviewjournal.com/sites/default/files/field/media/web1_BP-VILLAGE-MED_092914ev_004_0.jpg, http://www.reviewjournal.com/sites/default/files/field/media/web1_copy_BP-VILLAGE-MED_092914ev_002_0.jpg"}, "creator": {"identifier": "@reviewjournal", "id": 15358759}, "card": "summary"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "al": {"web": {"should_fallback": "true"}, "android": {"url": "review-journal://?eid=1989798", "app_name": "review-journal", "package": "com.LVRJ"}, "ios": {"url": "review-journal://?eid=1989798", "app_store_id": 540820524, "app_name": "review-journal"}}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1098299519", "fb": {"admins": 630759385, "app_id": 195491203833571}, "google-play-app": "app-id=com.LVRJ", "parsely-author": "JEFFREY MEEHAN Special to the Las Vegas Business Press", "parsely-type": "post", "keywords": "Business Press,Business,", "parsely-section": "Business Press", "article": {"published_time": "2014-10-06T11:07:56-07:00"}, "og": {"site_name": "Las Vegas Review-Journal", "description": "Community collaboration will be the key to success for an ambitious plan to expand free clinic services to downtown Las Vegas, according to the leader of the nonprofit organization leading the effort.", "title": "Clinic makes its mission to serve those in need", "url": "http://www.reviewjournal.com/business/business-press/clinic-makes-its-mission-serve-those-need", "image": "http://www.reviewjournal.com/sites/default/files/field/media/web1_copy_BP-VILLAGE-MED_092914ev_005_0.jpg", "type": "article"}, "parsely-image-url": "http://www.reviewjournal.com/sites/default/files/field/media/web1_copy_BP-VILLAGE-MED_092914ev_005_0.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=0.9", "parsely-pub-date": "2014-10-06T18:07:56Z"}, "article_summary": "\u201cMost people aren\u2019t going to spend their last dollar on dental care,\u201d Jameson said.\nThe 12,000-square-foot Ruffin Family Clinic is scheduled to open mid-2015 near the corner of Martin Luther King Boulevard and Madison Avenue.\nBeyond testing, Volunteers in Medicine offers those with diabetes, hypertension and other chronic conditions medications through its own dispensary.\n\u201cFlorence and Volunteers in Medicine are in my linkage to care network,\u201d Wong said.\nVolunteers in Medicine was formed in 2008 and its first location opened two years later."}
