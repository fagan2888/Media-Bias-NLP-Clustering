There was an awkward moment at today's House Oversight and Government Reform Committee hearing on Obamacare when a New York Democrat rapped GOP critics with quotes from a satirical New Yorker feature, The Borowitz Report.

Rep. Carolyn Maloney, while calling it her own “distinguished comedic think tank,” quoted from several stories in the Borowitz satire blog as if they were accurate, most notably one in which author Andy Borowitz joked that Republicans are complaining that the problem-plagued Obamacare website is working too fast.

She later called the blog a “distinguished report.” Maloney said, “The distinguished report went on to criticize some of my Republican colleagues for plotting to make the Affordable Care Act work, criticizing efforts by President Obama and his team to be flexible, making adjustments in their plan.”

Borowitz describes his column as “news, reshuffled.” His latest post is about how the Hubble Space Telescope is sending “selfies” back to NASA.
