In a pre-lunch interview, she said her current passion -- \"to help people make better, more informed decisions about their health\" -- probably comes from being \"a doctor's daughter who always thought I would be a doctor.\"\n\nHere are a few soundbites.\n\nOn her broadcast career: \"When I first went to Good Morning America it was the mid-'70s, and that was a time when women got the 'women's stories' -- parenting, health, education, managing your home, things that actually matter to people. Oddly, being relegated to those women's stories probably really had a big impact on my longevity there.\"\n\nOn being her late mother's caregiver: \"I got that call. Everybody always gets that call -- the stroke, the heart attack, the broken hip -- whatever it is that plunges you into the world of caregiving. I thought, 'Wow, you're a smart girl, Joan. Why didn't you have a plan in place?'\"\n\nOn having a senior care adviser help her choose a facility for her mother: \"Afterwards I thought, Joan, if you wanted a house you would have gotten a realtor. I became a staunch believer in getting someone who is an expert in the field.\"\n\nOn the role of adult children: \"They are uncomfortable pressing their parents to talk about it. But if seniors only realized that one of the best gifts they could ever give their child would be to pass over all the information about where are all the important papers, what are the medications they take, who are their doctors. If they did that, first of all they would insure they are taken care of the way they wish. Second of all, they would take a load off the shoulders of their children, and they would make that last life chapter so much easier to navigate. But the problem is that when you go to visit aging parents they always put on a good face. And of course we want to believe they're fine, because if they're not fine it means that our lives are going to change and we're going to have to start taking care of them. So we go in with blinders on.\"\n\nOn end-of-life care: \"I went down this path with my mom and took care of her in her later years and was with her right through hospice. And I learned something -- that it's important to visit often, not just to drop in, but to visit often. And the more you talk about their formative years, their earlier years, when you were growing up as a child, those are the memories that they can tap into. Not only does it allow them to feel comfortable because they can remember that, but also all the caregivers around them hear those stories, and it gives them that wonderful information.\n\n\"At the very end it's really important because the caregivers around my mom -- because we didn't have a lot of relatives around -- they were so loving and so compassionate that they made her feel comfortable, and admittedly, they made me feel more comfortable with that very natural life process, but a difficult one for all of us.\"\n\nFollow Barbara Peters Smith on Twitter @BarbaraPSmith.", "article_metadata": {"wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}}, "article_summary": "Not only does it allow them to feel comfortable because they can remember that, but also all the caregivers around them hear those stories, and it gives them that wonderful information.\nOddly, being relegated to those women's stories probably really had a big impact on my longevity there.\"\nAnd I learned something -- that it's important to visit often, not just to drop in, but to visit often.\nOn having a senior care adviser help her choose a facility for her mother: \"Afterwards I thought, Joan, if you wanted a house you would have gotten a realtor.\nBut the problem is that when you go to visit aging parents they always put on a good face."}
