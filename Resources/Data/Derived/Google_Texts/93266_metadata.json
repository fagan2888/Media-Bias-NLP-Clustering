But Oklahoma City managed to squeeze in three games in the latest evaluation period of Feb. 7-13. And Kevin Durant was stellar in that span, earning him Denver Post player of the week honors.\n\nWhat\u2019s up: Durant was a cumulative plus-20.7, which led all players, as the Thunder won all three games. Durant averaged 31.7 points, 6.3 rebounds and 3.7 assists in the three games. He shot a sizzling 65.3 percent from the field and an impressive 61.9 percent from 3-point range.\n\nBackground: Anyone who attended the Nuggets\u2019 game against Oklahoma City on Feb. 9 knows that was Durant\u2019s best game of the week \u2014 40 points, with full range on his jump shot on display all night long. His most important production, however, came in a win over the Memphis Grizzlies two nights later. His 26 points and 10 rebounds helped OKC topple one of the West\u2019s best as the Thunder continues to climb back into the playoff race.\n\nDempsey\u2019s take: It\u2019s crazy to think this is Durant\u2019s first player of the week award this season, but remember, he missed significant time because of injuries. He\u2019s still played in only 26 of the Thunder\u2019s 53 games to date. Because of that, he\u2019s relatively fresh, a scary thought for teams opposing him after the all-star break.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Kevin Durant,NBA,spotlight", "language": "en, sv", "og": {"site_name": "Nuggets Ink", "description": "Kevin Durant was a cumulative plus-20.7, which led all players, as the Thunder won all three games.", "title": "Kevin Durant: Spotlight on Oklahoma City Thunder forward", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/nuggets/2015/02/14/kevin-durant-spotlight-oklahoma-city-thunder-forward/12575/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/nuggets/files/2012/06/kevin-durant-495x360.jpg", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "Kevin Durant was a cumulative plus-20.7, which led all players, as the Thunder won all three games.", "creator": "@dempseyPost", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/nuggets/2015/02/14/kevin-durant-spotlight-oklahoma-city-thunder-forward/12575/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/nuggets/files/2012/06/kevin-durant-495x360.jpg", "title": "Kevin Durant: Spotlight on Oklahoma City Thunder forward", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "Kevin Durant was a cumulative plus-20.7, which led all players, as the Thunder won all three games."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0c8f\"", "article_summary": "Spotlight on\u2026 Kevin Durant, forward, ThunderWhen: It was a short week for many of the NBA\u2019s teams leading into the all-star break.\nBut Oklahoma City managed to squeeze in three games in the latest evaluation period of Feb. 7-13.\nWhat\u2019s up: Durant was a cumulative plus-20.7, which led all players, as the Thunder won all three games.\nHis 26 points and 10 rebounds helped OKC topple one of the West\u2019s best as the Thunder continues to climb back into the playoff race.\nAnd Kevin Durant was stellar in that span, earning him Denver Post player of the week honors."}
