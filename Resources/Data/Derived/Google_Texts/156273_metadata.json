And yet the ways it deals with class, race, gender and animal rights are all deeply problematic.\n\nSome readers may take criticism of \u201cOcarina\u201d as dismissal of the game. But this isn\u2019t the case. As Feminist Frequency blogger Anita Sarkeesian says, \u201cRemember that it\u2019s both possible and even necessary to simultaneously enjoy media while also being critical of its more problematic or pernicious aspects.\u201d\n\nBecause games\u2019 technological capabilities have increased so rapidly since \u201cOcarina\u201d was released, I suspect the title\u2019s reputation is somewhat inflated due to nostalgia of critics of a certain age. But it\u2019s a nostalgia I share. There is no game with which I have more fond memories. So criticism here should be interpreted as loyal opposition.\n\nThe game\u2019s perspective on class issues can best be seen in its portrayal of the Kakariko carpenters and the wealthy family in the House of Skulltulla.\n\nThe relationship between the self-described \u201cboss\u201d of the carpenters and those he calls \u201cmy workers,\u201d appears to be one of a guild member and apprentices or journeymen. The boss refers to himself as a master craftsman, and says the workers were hired by the royal family to improve the village. Karl Marx described this relationship as one of \u201coppressor and oppressed,\u201d comparing it to that of \u201cfreeman and slave, patrician and plebeian, (and) lord and serf.\u201d\n\n\u201cOcarina\u201d portrays the apprentices or journeymen as lazy and shiftless, and the boss as the only one willing to work. \u201cYoung men these days don\u2019t have any ambition,\u201d the boss says. \u201cDo you know what I mean, kid? My workers are just running aimlessly around the village, and they\u2019re not making any progress at all \u2026 Even my own son doesn\u2019t have a job, and he just wanders around all day! They\u2019re all worthless, I tell you!\u201d\n\nSome may interpret the fate of the wealthy family, who are transformed into spiderlike creatures, in the House of Skulltulla as a condemnation of an exploitive class system, but that would be a mistake.\n\n\u201cFolks around here tell of a fabulously rich family that once lived in one of the houses in this village,\u201d an elderly character in Kakariko confides. \u201cBut they say that the entire family was cursed due to their greed! Who knows what might happen to those who are consumed by greed.\u201d\n\nBy focusing on the greed of individuals, the game ignores how private property incentivizes and even mandates such behavior. And with this moralizing focus comes a belief that society\u2019s economic ills are intractable because of humanity\u2019s flawed nature.\n\nThe racial, ethnic and religious traits of the \u201cgood characters\u201d and the \u201cbad characters\u201d within the game also demonstrate a certain xenophobia. All of the good characters, such as the Hylians and Kokiri, are white. In contrast, all of the bad characters, such as the thieving Gerudo and their king, Ganondorf, have brown skin. The Gerudo live in the desert, and in case it wasn\u2019t clear what real-life group of people they are based on, the original Gerudo symbol is strongly reminiscent of the Islamic star and crescent.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The beloved game takes a dim view of workers, people of color and women", "title": "\u201cThe Legend of Zelda\u201d is classist, sexist and racist", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The beloved game takes a dim view of workers, people of color and women", "title": "\u201cThe Legend of Zelda\u201d is classist, sexist and racist", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2013/10/05/the_legend_of_zelda_is_classist_sexist_and_racist/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/09/legend_of_zelda.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The beloved game takes a dim view of workers, people of color and women", "title": "\u201cThe Legend of Zelda\u201d is classist, sexist and racist", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/09/legend_of_zelda.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Jon Hochschartner", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, classism, games, Gaming, Racism, Sexism, The Legend of Zelda, Video Games", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "In contrast, all of the bad characters, such as the thieving Gerudo and their king, Ganondorf, have brown skin.\nThe racial, ethnic and religious traits of the \u201cgood characters\u201d and the \u201cbad characters\u201d within the game also demonstrate a certain xenophobia.\nTopics: classism, games, Gaming, Racism, Sexism, The Legend of Zelda, Video Games, Technology News, Entertainment NewsThis year marks the 15th anniversary of the release of \u201cThe Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time.\u201d Critics frequently laud the Nintendo 64 title as the greatest video game ever.\nThe boss refers to himself as a master craftsman, and says the workers were hired by the royal family to improve the village.\nAnd yet the ways it deals with class, race, gender and animal rights are all deeply problematic."}
