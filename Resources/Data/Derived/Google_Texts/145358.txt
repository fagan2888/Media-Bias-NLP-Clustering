(Reading) -- A midstate health center is set to receive nearly one million dollars to add space to care for more patients.

The funding for the Berks Community Health Center is part of the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare.

It was first awarded $650,000 a year ago to build a health center to serve lower-income people.

The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services awarded four Pennsylvania health centers a total of nearly $3.9 million.

Across the U.S., the investment totals more than $260 million.
