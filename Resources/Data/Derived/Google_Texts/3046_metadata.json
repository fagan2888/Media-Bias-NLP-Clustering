Did I win eight awards?\u201d she asked excitedly. \u201cYeah, sick.\u201d\n\nSwift\u2019s video opened with her and Selena Gomez fighting men in an office and then fighting each other. It ended with Swift\u2019s and Gomez\u2019s armies going head to head. Other stars in the clip included Mariska Hargitay, Ellen Pompeo, Jessica Alba and Ellie Goulding, and Hayley Williams of Paramore.\n\nSwift swapped her first two verses with new ones from rapper Kendrick Lamar for \u201cBad Blood,\u201d a song rumored to be about Swift\u2019s friendship with Katy Perry.\n\nSwift\u2019s other wins included top female artist and Billboard 200 album for \u201c1989.\u201d She sat in the audience with some of her \u201cBad Blood\u201d co-stars as well as rumored boyfriend Calvin Harris. Swift kissed the DJ-producer-singer on the cheek and gave him a hug after winning her awards.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m happy right now that it all was pulled off without a hitch,\u201d an excited Swift said in the AP interview about her new video. \u201cI can\u2019t believe it didn\u2019t leak. I can\u2019t believe the Kendrick version of the song didn\u2019t leak. Right now I am just taking the biggest sigh of relief that the fans got to experience it the way I wanted them to experience it, which was a full element of surprise.\u201d\n\nThough Swift had an epic open of the Billboard Awards with her video, Kanye West\u2019s closing off the show was tragic. The rapper was booed in Las Vegas when he performed \u201cAll Day\u201d and \u201cBlack Skinhead.\u201d The stage was smoky and it was hard to see West at times.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Taylor Swift makes history at Billboard Music Awards", "author": "Mesfin Fekadu", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Taylor Swift makes history at Billboard Music Awards", "title": "Taylor Swift makes history at Billboard Music Awards", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/05/18/taylor_swift_makes_history_at_billboard_music_awards/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/05/2015-billboard-music-awards-show.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Taylor Swift makes history at Billboard Music Awards", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/05/2015-billboard-music-awards-show.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "title": "Taylor Swift makes history at Billboard Music Awards", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Taylor Swift makes history at Billboard Music Awards", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Topics: From the Wires, Entertainment News, NewsLAS VEGAS (AP) \u2014 Taylor Swift had a historic night at the Billboard Music Awards: The pop star is the most decorated artist in the show\u2019s history win 20 wins, beating Garth Brooks\u2019 19-win record.\nSwift kissed the DJ-producer-singer on the cheek and gave him a hug after winning her awards.\nDid I win eight awards?\u201d she asked excitedly.\n\u201cI\u2019m happy right now that it all was pulled off without a hitch,\u201d an excited Swift said in the AP interview about her new video.\n\u201cYeah, sick.\u201dSwift\u2019s video opened with her and Selena Gomez fighting men in an office and then fighting each other."}
