Police have identified the man killed early Sunday in the 1200 block of South Turquoise Vista as Ian Hoying, 24, according to a media release.

They have arrested 19-year-old Dezon Scott and charged him with second degree murder, Tucson Police Department spokeswoman Kim Bay announced in the release.

Investigators have determined the shooting happened around 2 a.m. Sunday after the two men were arguing on an outside staircase at an apartment complex, she said. It did not appear the two already knew each other.

Scott allegedly pointed a handgun at Hoying, who continued to walk toward Scott. Scott then fired, according to police.

Scott left the area but returned and was taken into custody without incident, according to the release.

Anyone with information is asked to call 911 or 88-CRIME.
