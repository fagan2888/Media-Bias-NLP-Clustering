In the event that you\u2019re unfamiliar with Salon dot com, suffice to say, I stand with Chait and Kamerow.\n\nI didn\u2019t write about this earlier because, even though McArdle and Gottleib won the debate in the eyes of those in attendance, I thought the proposition (which presumably they didn\u2019t pick) was almost impossibly unfair to them. They had to convincingly argue that Obamacare had fallen into a persistent vegetative state; Chait and Kamerow could win simply by convincing people that it might come out of its coma at some point.\n\nBut then on Tuesday, McArdle imported many of the comments and arguments she used on the debate stage into a column called \u201cResolved: Obamacare Is Now Beyond Rescue,\u201d so if she at any point believed the burdens of proof were stacked unevenly against her, I think it\u2019s fair to assume that like so many conservatives she\u2019s now completely certain that her position is correct and her arguments unassailable. Obamacare is beyond rescue.\n\nI think this is almost definitionally wrong for two reasons, one technical and one philosophical.\n\nChait addressed the first pretty elegantly in his presentation, so I\u2019ll more or less recapitulate his argument. Obamacare\u2019s an insurance system intended, for now, to patch a large hole in the country\u2019s safety net, which creates healthcare guarantees for most but not all Americans. It could in theory be expanded as other programs are phased out or incorporated in, but that\u2019s a question for future years.\n\nThe system works by guaranteeing that uninsured people can buy private, regulated coverage; providing them subsidies on a sliding, so that the plans on the market are relatively affordable; and penalizing them if they opt out. A system like this becomes \u201cbeyond rescue\u201d if very few people enter it, or carriers pull out of it en masse, or perhaps a combination of the two, precipitated by an actuarial death spiral, where an unexpectedly ill client base causes insurers to increase premiums, driving more healthy people out of the market until it fails altogether.\n\nObamacare might also be beyond rescue if its political liabilities are so severe that Congress will ultimately be forced to replace or repeal it, regardless of the system\u2019s functionality.\n\nAnything short of these kinds of critical failures belies McArdles premise.\n\nThat obviously doesn\u2019t mean Obamacare hasn\u2019t fallen short of expectations in any way. It obviously has, in many. McArdle\u2019s presentation and follow-up article both include litanies of embarrassing screw-ups that have plagued the rollout. And though we can\u2019t know for sure just yet, it\u2019s likely that the coverage expansion will be smaller in the first year than originally anticipated. There are a lot of reasons for that. Healthcare.gov\u2019s two-month outage is a big one; insufficiently generous subsidies is another. An active and ongoing campaign to discourage enrollment and block the Medicaid expansion in Republican-run states is a third.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Conservatives want you to believe that Obamacare is \"beyond rescue\" -- but the data tells a very different story", "title": "The right\u2019s fantasy is shattered: Why Obamacare has already succeeded", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Conservatives want you to believe that Obamacare is \"beyond rescue\" -- but the data tells a very different story", "title": "The right\u2019s fantasy is shattered: Why Obamacare has already succeeded", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/01/24/the_rights_fantasy_is_shattered_why_obamacare_has_already_succeeded/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2012/09/obama_happy_economy_rect.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Conservatives want you to believe that Obamacare is \"beyond rescue\" -- but the data tells a very different story", "title": "The right\u2019s fantasy is shattered: Why Obamacare has already succeeded", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2012/09/obama_happy_economy_rect.jpg", "creator": "@brianbeutler", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Brian Beutler", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Affordable Care Act, Editor's Picks, GOP, Health Care, health insurance, Media Criticism, Megan McArdle, Obamacare, The Right", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3568\"", "article_summary": "Obamacare is beyond rescue.\nThat obviously doesn\u2019t mean Obamacare hasn\u2019t fallen short of expectations in any way.\nIn the event that you\u2019re unfamiliar with Salon dot com, suffice to say, I stand with Chait and Kamerow.\nAn active and ongoing campaign to discourage enrollment and block the Medicaid expansion in Republican-run states is a third.\nObamacare might also be beyond rescue if its political liabilities are so severe that Congress will ultimately be forced to replace or repeal it, regardless of the system\u2019s functionality."}
