As one woman put it in a letter to The New York Times:\n\nI should like to let you know how important sliced bread is to the morale and saneness of a household. My husband and four children are all in a rush during and after breakfast. Without ready-sliced bread I must do the slicing for toast\u2014two pieces for each one\u2014that\u2019s ten. For their lunches I must cut by hand at least twenty slices, for two sandwiches apiece. Afterward I make my own toast. Twenty-two slices of bread to be cut in a hurry!\"\n\nThe head of the War Food Administration said the ban was to conserve the thicker wax paper that Federal Drug Administration regulations said bakeries had to use because sliced bread went stale faster than whole loaves.\n\nThe ban did not last long though, probably due to its unpopularity. The government repealed it three months later with the head of the War Food Administration saying,\n\nOur experience with the order, however, leads us to believe that the savings are not as much as we expected, and the War Production Board tells us that sufficient wax paper to wrap sliced bread for four months is in the hands of paper processor and the baking industry.\n\nSandwich-loving Americans haven't gone stale on the modern convenience since.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "On this day 86 years ago, the best thing since\u2014well, since ever\u2014hit store shelves: sliced bread.
