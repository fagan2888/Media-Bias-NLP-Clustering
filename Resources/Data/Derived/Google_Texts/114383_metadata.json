That was a target that came from the Congressional Budget Office, and it has become an accepted number. There\u2019s no magic to the 7 million. What there is magic to is that in the month of December a million Americans signed up for insurance.\u201d\n\n\u2014 White House aide Phil Schiliro, interview on MSNBC, Dec. 31, 2013\n\nThis column has been updated.\n\nThe White House this week crowed about the fact that, as of the end of the year, 2.1 million Americans have signed up for insurance either through the federal health-care exchange or state-run exchanges. The message was that the Affordable Care Act Web site, which had a troubled launch, was turning a corner.\n\nAt the same time, the administration has backed away from the idea that it suggested it had a \u201ctarget\u201d of 7 million enrollees when the enrollment period for 2014 ends in March. As Schiliro put it, \u201cthat was never our target number.\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s explore this figure and the administration\u2019s enrollment claims.\n\nThe Facts\n\nThe 7 million figure did originate as an estimate (not a target) by the CBO. Before HealthCare.gov launched, senior administration officials certainly embraced the number.\n\nHere\u2019s Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius speaking to reporters last June: \u201cWe\u2019re hopeful that 7 million is a realistic target.\u201d\n\nAnd here she is on Sept. 30, in an interview with NBC News: \u201cI think success looks like at least 7 million people having signed up by the end of March 2014.\u201d\n\nMoreover, on Sept. 5, 2013, Marilyn Tavenner, administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, sent Sebelius a memo titled, \u201cProjected Monthly Enrollment Targets for Health Insurance Marketplaces in 2014.\u201d\n\nThe memo offered an estimate of 7,066,000, drawing both on CBO\u2019s estimate and the experience of the universal health plan in Massachusetts, Medicare Part D \u201cand conversations with employers, issuers and states.\u201d It projected that enrollment would be 3.3 million by the end of December.\n\nThe 7 million figure, apparently, became less relevant as \u201ca target\u201d or a measure of success when it became clear that the Web site\u2019s problems were making it difficult for people to sign up.\n\nInstead, officials have argued that a more relevant figure is the mix of young and old people. That\u2019s because younger people tend to be healthier and thus have lower medical expenses; if only older people sign up, premiums would soar.\n\n(To be fair, when Sebelius spoke of 7 million being \u201ca realistic target,\u201d she also made this point: \u201cIt\u2019s both about numbers and hopefully getting a balanced risk pool. So a lot of our efforts will be using creative ways to outreach to sort of the young healthy population who is eligible but who may not get up every morning thinking about health insurance.\u201d But the media have tended to emphasize the 7 million figure.)\n\nIn one possible good sign, the state of Kentucky announced this week that 40 percent of the 116,000 enrollees in Medicaid or qualified health plans in the state are under 35 years old. Officials are looking for at least 30 percent of enrollees to be under 35.\n\nIt\u2019s important to remember that the health-care marketplace is not a single entity, but at least 51 different marketplaces, each with its own risk pool, so it is quite possible some states will do very well while others might end up with an unbalanced mix.\n\nBut there is one funny thing about the administration\u2019s enrollment figures: The White House counts \u201can enrollee\u201d as anyone who has selected a qualified health plan.\n\n\u201cOnce someone clicks \u2018enroll\u2019 and selects a plan, we consider them enrolled,\u201d a senior White House official said. \u201cWe don\u2019t know if they have paid or when they pay the company because it\u2019s a private transaction between the company and the consumer.\u201d\n\n[Update: Administration officials now concede that originally enrollment information was supposed to have been received, but that part of the system has not been completed yet.\n\n\u201cWe do not have information on who has paid their premiums now,\u201d one official said. \u201cWe will in the future. This is part of the back-end financial management systems that are left to be built. Issuers will be reporting to us on completed enrollments in connection with payments of premium tax and cost-sharing subsidies, but that we don\u2019t yet have that data.\u201d\n\nUnder a work-around, insurers were expected to provide numbers by Dec. 27, but since premiums are not due until Jan. 10, any information that has been received is not yet complete.]\n\nThus it is possible that thousands, or even tens of thousands, of \u201cenrollees,\u201d under the administration\u2019s definition, have not purchased a plan.\n\nInsurance industry officials report that they are still receiving duplicate ID numbers for enrollees, as well as experiencing a continuing problem with so-called \u201corphans.\u201d These are people who are recorded by HealthCare.gov as having picked an insurer, but the companies have no record of these persons, meaning they cannot be sent a bill or receive an insurance card.\n\nMoreover, CBO\u2019s original estimate of 7 million assumed that people had paid for their plans. Under CBO\u2019s definition, if a person bought coverage that began Jan. 1 and then never got around to paying, then CBO would not count that person as having been covered at all.\n\nSo it\u2019s quite likely the administration is even further behind the targets outlined in Tavenner\u2019s memo than is currently apparent. That memo assumed consumers paid their first month\u2019s premium prior to receiving coverage.\n\nThe Pinocchio Test\n\nWhether or not the administration originally came up with the 7 million figure, officials certainly embraced it as a target in the months leading up to the implementation of the Affordable Care Act. We agree that the mix of young and old enrollees is perhaps the more relevant number, but it\u2019s a bit odd at this point for the administration to minimize the 7 million figure. Everyone knows enrollment got off to a slow start \u2014 and one can safely assume the administration would be bragging if in December it had exceeded the targets in Tavenner\u2019s memo.\n\nMoreover, the administration\u2019s definition of \u201csigning up\u201d is more expansive than what most people would consider as enrolling in a plan. Officials should be more frank in explaining that one reason for selecting this measure is because the system is not yet fully functioning.\n\nTwo Pinocchios\n\n\n\n\n\n(About our rating scale)\n\nSend us facts to check by filling out this form\n\nFollow The Fact Checker on Twitter and friend us on Facebook", "article_metadata": {"description": "The administration has distanced itself from a enrollment target that it used to tout.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/FactChecker", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "The administration has distanced itself from a enrollment target that it used to tout.", "title": "The White House\u2019s claim that 7 million enrolled in Obamacare \u2018was never our target number\u2019", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2014/01/03/the-white-houses-claim-that-7-million-enrolled-in-obamacare-was-never-our-target-number/", "image": "https://images.washingtonpost.com/?url=http://img.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/files/2013/10/obamacare-site.png&w=1484&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@GlennKesslerWP"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2014/01/03/the-white-houses-claim-that-7-million-enrolled-in-obamacare-was-never-our-target-number/", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "obamacare. affordable care act, obamacare enrollment, obamacare repeal, 7 million obamacare, glenn kessler, fact checker, factchecker,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/FactChecker"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "obamacare. affordable care act, obamacare enrollment, obamacare repeal, 7 million obamacare, glenn kessler, fact checker, factchecker,"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb8c7\"", "article_summary": "The FactsThe 7 million figure did originate as an estimate (not a target) by the CBO.\nBefore HealthCare.gov launched, senior administration officials certainly embraced the number.\nWhat there is magic to is that in the month of December a million Americans signed up for insurance.\u201d\u2014 White House aide Phil Schiliro, interview on MSNBC, Dec. 31, 2013This column has been updated.\nThat was a target that came from the Congressional Budget Office, and it has become an accepted number.\nAt the same time, the administration has backed away from the idea that it suggested it had a \u201ctarget\u201d of 7 million enrollees when the enrollment period for 2014 ends in March."}
