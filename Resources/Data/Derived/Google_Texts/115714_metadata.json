That was the first sign of the times. The second was when the 42-year-old heard that I was a sex writer and grabbed my arm and said: \u201cYou have to write about gay men having sex without condoms.\u201d Michael added something about \u201cpre-exposure prophylaxis\u201d and \u201cantiretrovirals\u201d (forgive me, there was free wine involved). A week later, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released a study finding an increase in sex without condoms among gay men \u2014 and I immediately arranged to meet with Michael.\n\nSitting in the back of a coffee shop in the Castro, Michael got right to it. \u201cI don\u2019t like to use condoms,\u201d he said, blinking boldly. He explained that he had decided, based on medical advances, that there were times when unprotected sex was OK. Michael\u2019s personal compromise is this: He has condomless sex with HIV-negative men who are on pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), a daily medication that can reduce a person\u2019s risk of becoming infected with HIV. He also goes without protection with positive partners who are \u201cundetectable\u201d \u2014 meaning men who have tested positive for HIV, gone on antiretroviral treatment and reduced their viral count to barely-even-there.\n\n\u201cThere could be a new definition of safer sex,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are degrees of safe sex.\u201d\n\nIndeed, as a study published in the journal Clinical Infectious Diseases found, antiretrovirals have the potential to reduce the likelihood of HIV transmission by either lowering concentrations of HIV RNA, thereby \u201cdecreasing the risk that an infected person will transmit the virus\u201d or by using it as pre-exposure or post-exposure prophylaxis. Studies have found anywhere from a 60 to more than 90 percent reduction in transmission risk when an HIV-positive person becomes \u201cundetectable.\u201d\n\nAs for PrEP, a clinical trial found that it reduced the risk of transmission among a high-risk group by 42 percent; another trial found it could reduce the risk by 84 percent. Just last year, the Food and Drug Administration approved the use of pre-exposure prophylaxis to reduce the risk of transmission among men who have sex with men, and heterosexually active men and women.\n\nBut Jeffrey Manese, a physician\u2019s assistant to Michael\u2019s own doctor at a San Francisco medical practice primarily serving gay men, tells me that he is cautious when talking with patients about unprotected sex with undetectable partners. \u201cUsually I preface it by saying that this is a lower risk but there is still a risk. There are times when people have spikes on their viral count that could potentially put someone at risk, also if there is a co-infection occurring like gonorrhea, chlamydia or syphilis the risk might increase.\u201d As for couples where one partner is positive and one is negative, he says, \u201cI do discuss PrEP, but still counseling that safe sex guidelines should be attempted.\u201d It \u201cprovides another layer of protection but it\u2019s not 100 percent,\u201d he emphasized.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Drugs that reduce the risk of HIV transmission have complicated the definition of \u201cprotection\u201d for some gay men", "title": "\u201cThere are degrees of safe sex\u201d", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Drugs that reduce the risk of HIV transmission have complicated the definition of \u201cprotection\u201d for some gay men", "title": "\u201cThere are degrees of safe sex\u201d", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2013/12/22/there_are_degrees_of_safe_sex/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/12/condom_hand.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Drugs that reduce the risk of HIV transmission have complicated the definition of \u201cprotection\u201d for some gay men", "title": "\u201cThere are degrees of safe sex\u201d", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/12/condom_hand.jpg", "creator": "@TracyClarkFlory", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Tracy Clark-Flory", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, AIDS, Condoms, Editor's Picks, HIV, LGBT, Sex", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1bd8\"", "article_summary": "Topics: AIDS, Condoms, Editor's Picks, HIV, LGBT, Sex, Life NewsI first met Michael at a party in a tech entrepreneur\u2019s renovated San Francisco Victorian.\nJust last year, the Food and Drug Administration approved the use of pre-exposure prophylaxis to reduce the risk of transmission among men who have sex with men, and heterosexually active men and women.\nThe second was when the 42-year-old heard that I was a sex writer and grabbed my arm and said: \u201cYou have to write about gay men having sex without condoms.\u201d Michael added something about \u201cpre-exposure prophylaxis\u201d and \u201cantiretrovirals\u201d (forgive me, there was free wine involved).\nA week later, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released a study finding an increase in sex without condoms among gay men \u2014 and I immediately arranged to meet with Michael.\n\u201cUsually I preface it by saying that this is a lower risk but there is still a risk."}
