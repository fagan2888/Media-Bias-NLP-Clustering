New Mexico is the only state with a 24/7 registered nurse call center that is free to all residents, whether insured or not.\n\nIn operation since 2006, it has kept tens of thousands of New Mexicans out of emergency rooms and saved the state more than $68 million in health care expenses. It has provided a basic form of health care to thousands of uninsured people who have no other access to care. It also has relieved demand on doctors and hospitals in a sparsely populated state where all but a few counties have a severe shortage of health care providers.\n\nRelated: Obama Can't Save Obamacare from the Supreme Court\n\nOn top of that, the statewide call center has generated real-time public health data that has served as an early warning system during epidemics and natural disasters. In April, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) will recommend New Mexico\u2019s advice line as a national model that other states adopt during an emergency preparedness summit in Atlanta.\n\n\u201cWe did a thorough search to find out whether anyone had an ongoing telephone triage system that could be used as a model,\u201d said Lisa Koonin, a senior adviser in the CDC\u2019s influenza coordination unit. \u201cNew Mexico\u2019s NurseAdvice line is the only one we found. It really is one-of-a-kind,\u201d she said.\n\nNurse advice hotlines have been around since the 1960s, when health maintenance organizations (HMOs) tried to cut costs by inviting members to call a toll-free number to report their symptoms and get a nurse\u2019s advice before racing to the emergency room or making an appointment with a doctor. Similar call centers proliferated in the mid-1980s when computerized guidelines and so-called tele-triage software became widely available. Medicaid programs also began including nurse hotlines as part of their benefits. But the vast majority of these advice lines have been for members and patients only. New Mexico\u2019s advice line is free and has been used by nearly everyone in the state old enough to make a phone call \u2013 1.5 million residents are registered in NurseAdvice line\u2019s database, 75 percent of the state\u2019s roughly 2 million residents.\n\nHow It Works\n\nUsing one well-published telephone number (877-725-2552), anyone in the state can reach a registered nurse who picks up the line in less than three minutes \u2013 no telephone tree and no talking to robots. Most nurses who answer calls work part-time in local hospitals or clinics. All but a few answer phone calls from their homes.\n\nRelated: Medicaid Reform Gets Boost in Hoosier State\n\nAfter asking a series of questions, moving from most serious to least serious symptoms, a registered nurse uses medical algorithms and professional judgment to formulate a diagnosis. He or she then instructs the caller on what to do immediately and then often sets up an appointment with a local doctor. In a smaller number of cases, nurses tell callers to get to an emergency room as quickly as possible. \u201cWe always err on the conservative side,\u201d said registered nurse and program director Connie Fiorenzio.\n\nFinancial support for New Mexico\u2019s line comes from a public-private partnership that includes nearly every insurance carrier and managed care organization in the state, the state\u2019s Medicaid and public health departments, the University of New Mexico\u2019s Health Sciences Center, Indian Health Services, and numerous hospitals, physician practices and community health centers across the state.\n\nThe statewide reach of New Mexico NurseAdvice line, as well as its close ties with the medical community, have made it particularly effective at stemming the spread of infectious diseases, the CDC\u2019s Koonin said. During the H1N1 flu pandemic in 2009, for example, the line was able to keep thousands of people out of crowded emergency rooms and doctor\u2019s offices where they were at risk of either spreading or contracting the virus.\n\nRegistered nurses were able to quickly determine whether callers\u2019 symptoms indicated they had the flu, or something else. In some cases, nurses would contact an on-call doctor to prescribe Tamiflu, saving the caller a trip to an overcrowded waiting room.\n\nRelated: Four Little Words That Could Kill Obamacare\n\nNew Mexico\u2019s advice line stemmed the surges on hospitals and doctor\u2019s offices that other states across the country experienced. In other states, many of those who were illness-free panicked and went to the emergency room when they experienced any possible symptoms. In contrast, New Mexico\u2019s 24/7 nurses convinced many disease-free people to stay home, and gave clear instructions on how to avoid the contagion.\n\n\u201cWhen H1N1 hit, we were the resource,\u201d Fiorenzio said. \u201cI got a call from the New Mexico Department of Health on a Friday night at 9:00. We were using a (flu-specific) protocol by the next morning and we\u2019ve been responding in the same way ever since \u2013 whether it\u2019s hepatitis, listeria, salmonella or a water or restaurant problem.\u201d When wildfires start burning in the summer, Fiorenzio said, the line is able to quickly pinpoint who is experiencing breathing problems so the state can set evacuation plans.\n\nBeyond its public health benefits, NurseAdvice New Mexico stands out for other reasons. It has a 98 percent customer approval rating and a compliance rate of 85 percent, meaning callers heed the nurses\u2019 advice and either care for themselves at home, go to a doctor or go directly to a hospital based on the nurses\u2019 orders.\n\nImportance of Being Local\n\nAnother distinction that led the CDC to hold up New Mexico\u2019s advice line as a model is the program is state-run and staffed by locals. \u201cIt\u2019s really important that the nurses who answer the line are familiar with the state\u2019s health care system and its unique culture and lifestyles,\u201d said former state Sen. Dede Feldman, who sponsored $500,000 in start-up funding for the service in 2006. Feldman, a Democrat, said a major selling point was the call center would be state-based.\n\nRelated: Major Changes in Medicare Coming to Senior Health Care\n\nLawmakers immediately saw the advantage, Feldman said. One lawmaker, she recalled, told a story about calling his own HMO advice line after he burned his eyes while peeling green chilis. He said a nurse in Nova Scotia answered the call and had no idea what a green chile was, much less how to help relieve the burning.\n\nBut New Mexico\u2019s aims in 2006 went beyond providing culturally sensitive health advice. Dr. Art Kaufman, chief of the community medicine department at the University of New Mexico, saw the project as a way to provide much needed health care advice to the state\u2019s large uninsured population. At the time, New Mexico had the second highest uninsured rate in the nation. He envisioned the advice line taking pressure off hospitals and doctors, particularly in the state\u2019s remote regions.\n\nHe also believed the line was a way to help the state\u2019s large uninsured population find what medical professionals call \u201cmedical homes,\u201d a primary care provider or pediatric practice that coordinates a patient\u2019s care. When callers say they have no doctor, the NurseAdvice line sets up an initial appointment with a local doctor.\n\nThe line also provides respite for hard-to-find doctors who are willing to practice in remote parts of the state. \u201cIt has helped them avoid burn out and stay in their jobs longer,\u201d Feldman said.\n\nRelated: When Doctors Have to Play God Over Drug Shortages\n\nNew Mexico\u2019s success at launching its first-in-the-nation, public-private advice line was due in large part to a profound need for greater access to health care. With too few doctors and too little insurance coverage, it was obvious to everyone that something had to be done, Feldman said. In 2006, New Mexico\u2019s then-Democratic Gov. Bill Richardson tried and failed to enact a major health care reform law aimed at expanding insurance coverage. \u201cWhile that was going on,\u201d Feldman said, \u201cwe snuck this one through. It was low-tech and straightforward. It would make a difference on the ground.\u201d\n\nDr. Bart Schmitt, a pioneer in the field of telephone triage, gives Richardson much of the credit for the NurseAdvice line. \u201cBill Richardson pulled together the stakeholders \u2013 big hospitals, the university and insurance companies \u2013 and he made it work in the second poorest state in the country,\u201d he said.\n\nSchmitt said every state should have a call center for the uninsured and the insured who have no medical home. \u201cOtherwise, who do they call? They\u2019re boxed in,\u201d he said. \u201cThey can\u2019t get advice from anybody.\u201d\n\nThis article originally appeared in Stateline, a nonpartisan, nonprofit news service of the Pew Center on the States that provides daily reporting and analysis on trends in state policy.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "If your infant has a high fever or you\u2019re experiencing an unusual pain in your abdomen", "title": "The Surprising Way One State Saved Over $68 Million", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/02/25/Surprising-Way-One-State-Saved-Over-68-Million", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/03042013_hospital_er_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/02/25/Surprising-Way-One-State-Saved-Over-68-Million", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/03042013_hospital_er_article.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "If your infant has a high fever or you\u2019re experiencing an unusual pain in your abdomen", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "In operation since 2006, it has kept tens of thousands of New Mexicans out of emergency rooms and saved the state more than $68 million in health care expenses.\nIt has provided a basic form of health care to thousands of uninsured people who have no other access to care.\n\u201cNew Mexico\u2019s NurseAdvice line is the only one we found.\nWhen callers say they have no doctor, the NurseAdvice line sets up an initial appointment with a local doctor.\nBill Richardson tried and failed to enact a major health care reform law aimed at expanding insurance coverage."}
