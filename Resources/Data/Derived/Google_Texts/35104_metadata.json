Police reports before the suspension, from the City of Oxford, Miss., were obtained by the paper and revealed that he had allegedly been cited for several incidents, including a traffic stop in which drugs were involved. In an interview with ESPN, Henderson talked about these incidents, and his personal battle with drug use.\n\nOn the same day that Henderson was suspended, July 10, 2013, Andrews sent this tweet and Henderson responded:\n\nJust days ago, on April 17, Andrews\u2019s boyfriend, Jarret Stoll, a forward with the LA Kings, was arrested for drug possession, according to a Las Vegas police report.\n\nAnd Henderson made good on his word.\n\nBut, as of today, @NativeFlash22, who plays basketball for the Nift Al-Janoub Iraqi Superleague in Baghdad, has deleted that tweet from his Twitter account.\n\nNo formal charges against Stoll have been filed.\n\nRELATED: Ten Native Basketball Players You Should Watch Now\n\nMarch Madness!
