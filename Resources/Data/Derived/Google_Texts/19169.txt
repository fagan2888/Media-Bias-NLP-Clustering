Viking Owner Middleby Makes Another Acquisition With Century Park-Backed Lynx Grills

The purchase of the Sedona producer comes on the heels of Middleby's deals for Rangemaster and Marsal & Sons

Food equipment manufacturer Middleby Corp. (Nasdaq: MIDD) has acquired grill maker Lynx Grills from Century Park Capital Partners for an undisclosed amount.

Lynx, based in Downey, California, makes barbecue grills, outdoor ice machines, refrigerators along with other outdoor cooking equipment. The target owns the Lynx and Sedona brands and has about $50 million in annual revenue. Century Park acquired Lynx in 2006.

“We are excited about the continued growth opportunities of the Lynx and Sedona Brands, which we believe can be further enhanced within the broader Middleby group,” says Middleby CEO Selim Bassoul. Middleby, with headquarters in Elgin, Illinois, makes food equipment such as commercial ovens under the Rangemaster, TurboChef and Viking brands.

Middleby has been aggressive with acquisitions recently. The company recently bought oven maker AGA Rangemaster Group plc; commercial cooking equipment manufacturer Induc Commercial Electronics Co.; and deck oven producer Marsal & Sons.

Skadden Arps Slate Meagher & Flom LLP represented Middleby.
