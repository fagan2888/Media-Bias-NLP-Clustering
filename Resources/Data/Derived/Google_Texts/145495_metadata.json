My communication with my mother was minimal at this point.\n\nYears later when my mother got sick, I was \"gently prompted\" to attempt to salvage a relationship with my mother \"before it was too late.\" And so I did.\n\nWhat a mistake.\n\nShe suddenly became clingy (where she had no interest in me before), she would tell wonderful stories about being the loving mother (when, in fact, I was constantly berated for everything), and she would get me on the phone for hours at a time, spinning amazing tales of how great she was.\n\nI endured through it all, trying to be the good daughter. Toward the end it got bad.\n\nIn my last conversation with her, she suddenly physically attacked me and told me, \"If I had known I could have had an abortion in 1960, you would have never been born.\"\n\nShe passed two months later. Even though it was a relief, I still hear those words ringing in my head years later.\n\nThere are some instances where trying to develop a broken relationship is just not best for all involved.\n\n\u2014 Been There\n\nI \"divorced\" my mother when I was 40. When she died, 16 years later, I was filled with regret \u2014 regret that I hadn't \"divorced\" her 20 years earlier than I did.\n\nWhy had I let myself be saddled for so much of my life with efforts to stay connected to someone poisonous to my mental well-being?\n\n\u2014 Wisconsin\n\nWhen my mother died, lots of sympathy came to my brother and to me, but we were just grateful that it was over \u2014 that we would no longer suffer from her cruelty. We kept our gratitude to ourselves, having already experienced lots of advice on later regret.\n\nIf you could see inside my heart, you'd see scar tissue with her name on it that will never go away.\n\nNo one but my brother understands because no one but my brother lived through it as I did. It'd be nice if someone \u2014 anyone \u2014 just took my word for it.\n\n\u2014 Anonymous\n\nEmail Carolyn at tellme@washpost.com.\n\nWashington Post Writers Group", "article_metadata": {"title": "You can't fail with 'How wonderful for you'", "og": {"url": "http://www.jsonline.com/features/advice/you-cant-fail-with-how-wonderful-for-you-b99683846z1-371801311.html", "image": {"width": 200, "identifier": "http://media.jrn.com/images/js-for-social-200-final.jpg", "height": 200}, "type": "article", "description": "While I\u2019m away, readers give the advice.", "title": "You can\u2019t fail with \u2018How wonderful for you\u2019"}, "twitter": {"site": "@journalsentinel", "image": "http://media.jrn.com/images/js-for-social-200-final.jpg", "description": "While I\u2019m away, readers give the advice.", "card": "summary", "title": "You can't fail with 'How wonderful for you'"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "fb": {"admins": "journal.sentinel.1", "app_id": 227386193957280}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://media.jrn.com/designimages/logo-mjs-144-icon.png", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe03d2\"", "article_summary": "When she died, 16 years later, I was filled with regret \u2014 regret that I hadn't \"divorced\" her 20 years earlier than I did.\nWe kept our gratitude to ourselves, having already experienced lots of advice on later regret.\n\u2014 the only appropriate response is, \"How wonderful for you.\"\nNo one but my brother understands because no one but my brother lived through it as I did.\nEach week, there would be long phone calls to his sisters and mother, and frequent visits to his father."}
