Despite that, he said, the U.S. plans to pump an additional $7.6 billion into Afghanistan\u2019s security institutions in the short term, \u201cand billions more are expected to be appropriated every year for the foreseeable future.\u201d\n\nSopko, who heads the watchdog tasked with keeping tabs on reconstruction efforts in Afghanistan since 2010, said that even under the most optimistic scenario, \u201cAfghan government contributions would not fully fund the Afghanistan National Defense Security Forces by 2024.\u201d\n\nRelated: Is State Trying to Muzzle Afghanistan\u2019s Watchdog?\n\nHe said that senior U.S. military officials are also concerned that Afghans \u201cwill not master any of their essential functions\u201d by the time the U.S. begins drawing down its military presence in the country at the end of next year.\n\n\u201cSIGAR is worried that the Afghan ministries aren\u2019t, in any way, ready to stand on their own,\u201d Sopko said.\n\nJust last month, the auditors released a report revealing that the Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF) are currently at their lowest level since 2011\u2014right ahead of the 2015 fighting season. SIGAR said the ANSF had 20,000 fewer troops than last year, based on numbers provided by the Afghan defense ministry.\n\nRelated: What the Pentagon is Hiding from Its Auditors\n\nThe Pentagon had been keeping data on the ANSF, which had been classified until SIGAR and others pressured the Defense Department to release the information. Once declassified, SIGAR revealed the dismal outlook.\n\nThe auditors have raised concern about how little information the U.S. has on the troops, despite the vast amount of U.S. funding used to prop them up. Last week, Sopko told Congress that there\u2019s no way to determine whether troop levels provided by the Afghan government are accurate, or to measure the capabilities of those forces. That makes it even more difficult to determine how much funding is needed, he said.\n\n\u201cGiven that accurate reporting on ANSF strength is an important factor in judging Afghanistan\u2019s ability to maintain security and in determining the pace of U.S. troop withdrawals from the country, and that the United States is paying to train, equip, and sustain the Afghan troops based on these numbers, these inconsistencies are deeply troubling,\u201d SIGAR said in the latest report.\n\nLate last year, Sopko released a report highlighting the seven greatest risks to the entire $110 billion reconstruction efforts in Afghanistan. Unsurprisingly, the sustainability of the Afghan National Security Forces was high on the list.\n\nSpeaking on Wednesday, the IG reiterated the importance of the ANSF\u2019s ability to stand up on its own after the U.S. leaves.\n\n\u201cConsidering the effect a lack of security has on good governance, rule of law, and economic and social development, it may be the most important issue,\u201d Sopko said.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The Afghan National Security Forces, which the U.S.", "title": "$65 Billion Effort to Train Afghan Army is Failing", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/05/13/65-Billion-Effort-Train-Afghan-Army-Failing", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/09262014_Afghantistan_Police.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/05/13/65-Billion-Effort-Train-Afghan-Army-Failing", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/09262014_Afghantistan_Police.jpg", "creator": "@Briannaehley", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "The Afghan National Security Forces, which the U.S.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe21be\"", "article_summary": "Unsurprisingly, the sustainability of the Afghan National Security Forces was high on the list.\nThe Afghan National Security Forces, which the U.S. has spent a decade and $65 billion training, are at their weakest point in years and will fall apart unless the U.S. can somehow turn around its failing effort to make them self-competent.\nJust last month, the auditors released a report revealing that the Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF) are currently at their lowest level since 2011\u2014right ahead of the 2015 fighting season.\nSIGAR said the ANSF had 20,000 fewer troops than last year, based on numbers provided by the Afghan defense ministry.\n\u201cSIGAR is worried that the Afghan ministries aren\u2019t, in any way, ready to stand on their own,\u201d Sopko said."}
