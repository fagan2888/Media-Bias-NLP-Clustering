However, Fox News stars Bill O\u2019Reilly and Sean Hannity made sure that their core conservative audience didn\u2019t feel left out and that, in some ways, they still had a voice.\n\nEarlier this week, Sean Hannity had Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz on his show to discuss the Supreme Court decision. As expected, Cruz wasn\u2019t happy.\n\n\u201cAnd then on Friday, the marriage decision was directly contrary to the Constitution. It was, as Justice Scalia observed, five unelected judges saying their liberal policy views trump the considered judgment of 320 million Americans. It was judicial activism at its worst!\u201d\n\nCruz told Sean Hannity that he has introduced a constitutional amendment to preserve the authority of the states to define marriage as the union of one man and one woman. Hannity looked happy as he heard Cruz\u2019s words.\n\nLike Sean Hannity, Bill O\u2019Reilly was not happy about the Supreme Court decision either. O\u2019Reilly stated that he believes that people have a right to celebrate the gay marriage victory, but not rub off their views on others.\n\n\u201cAmericans who sincerely believe that judges do have the authority to redefine marriage have a perfect right to celebrate their victory provided they are following their consciences. However, they do not have a right to demonize those who disagree based on the same principle, conscience.\u201d\n\nAccording to Real Clear Politics, O\u2019Reilly believes the left is delirious with joy for one specific reason.\n\n\u201cAfter the Supreme Court legalized gay marriage last week, the far left was delirious with joy. Not so much because homosexuals can now tie the knot, but because the decision has anti-church ramifications.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Reilly went on to note that the Supreme Court would never order clerics to marry gays. He believes, however, that the four liberal justices may lean in that direction if Hillary Clinton is elected president, especially if she elects another ultra-liberal judge.\n\nBill O\u2019Reilly isn\u2019t as anti-gay marriage as Sean Hannity, but he still thinks the decision was unconstitutional. O\u2019Reilly also criticized the way the \u201cactivist judges\u201d handled the ObamaCare case. O\u2019Reilly believes our liberties are taking a huge hit due to the recent rulings.\n\nWhile the gay marriage ruling may seem to be a hard blow to the generally conservative Fox News, it really isn\u2019t. Fox News knows how to perfectly pander to its audience, who feels alienated by the way the country is changing. You can expect ratings for both Sean Hannity and Bill O\u2019Reilly to increase in the coming months.\n\n[Photos by Rob Kim and Desiree Navarro/Getty Images]", "article_metadata": {"description": "Last week, the Supreme Court gave a historic blow to the right wing conservatives by ruling that gay marriage is now legal in all 50 states.
