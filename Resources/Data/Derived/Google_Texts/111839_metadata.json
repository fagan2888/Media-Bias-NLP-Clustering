Aaron Schock at his Washington, D.C., office only to find out moments after my arrival he was resigning.\n\nCertainly we were going to talk about the scandals that had engulfed Schock over the past six weeks. How could we not? New details were coming out daily, and it was an opportunity to touch base on those matters without a crowd of other reporters around.\n\nBut as I walked down the hallway in the Rayburn House Office Building to catch my first glimpse of the \u201cDownton Abbey\u201d-themed office that sparked six weeks of scandalous revelations, I was actually thinking about policy.\n\nYou see, I didn\u2019t come to the Capitol to observe \u2014 or cover \u2014 a surprise resignation.\n\nWhen the Peoria Republican and I had last talked, after an event the Wednesday before in the district, I shared with him that I\u2019d love to be able to focus on matters beyond scandal, too, spending some time talking about legislation that he was pushing for. He\u2019d alluded earlier that night to a measure he was reintroducing, carving out for Christian Scientists an exception to Obamacare requirements, for example.\n\nObviously that conversation didn\u2019t happen \u2014 and on a day when Schock likely would have reveled in it. A wonk about finances and trade, he would have happily talked to me in great depth about the budget rolled out that day by House Republican leaders, cautioning with one of his default expressions that he didn\u2019t \u201cwant to get too far into the weeds\u201d before starting to do just that.\n\nInstead when I arrived in his waiting room about 15 minutes ahead of my appointment and took a seat, finding out shortly about a report that Schock had just announced his resignation and getting the text of his letter calling it quits moments later.\n\nYou wouldn\u2019t have known about it right away from mood in the office, though. The bright red reception space, ringed above by small pictures of U.S. presidents, was filled with various visitors who had meetings scheduled with Schock\u2019s congressional staff to talk about issues from farm policy to the environment.\n\nEmployees passed through every couple minutes bearing papers and periodically bringing advocacy groups in from the waiting area to sit and talk. Business, in short, continued as usual, with many of those visiting seemingly unaware of the resignation.\n\nSitting unflappably at the high, white reception desk was a young man handling a stream of phone calls that picked up slowly over the next hour, referring what were clearly press requests to interim spokesman Matt Chambers. Every so often, a national reporter would come into the office \u2014 some tentatively, others boldly \u2014 looking for Schock or his chief of staff, Mark Roman. The receptionist was thrown only once, when a young woman ducked in long enough to focus her cell phone, boldly telling him she \u201cjust wanted a selfie in \u2018Downton Abbey\u2019\u201d before scurrying away.\n\nFrom the noise out in the hall, those national reporters began to set up camp, preparing for a lengthy stakeout to catch any return to the office by the embattled lawmaker on camera. Periodically I could hear people admonishing the herd to back away, to stop blocking nearby doors, to stay on one side of the corridor or the other.\n\nThey paid little heed and continued to mill about as I waited inside in vain while more people trooped through to talk with staff about issues.\n\nRoman eventually returned \u2014 sans Schock \u2014 and we spoke briefly and off-the-record inside the soon-to-be-former congressman\u2019s office before I departed, knowing that it made little sense, personally or politically for Schock to parade past the row of cameras.\n\nBut while there I got a glimpse of the office that launched the six-week series of stories that led to Schock\u2019s political downfall and, as we learned Friday, investigation by the Justice Department.\n\nHere\u2019s the thing: The office isn\u2019t that ornate.\n\nIt has character. But so, too, does that of Guam\u2019s delegate to Congress at the other end of the long hallway, where segments of hunter green are painted on the walls. Other workspaces I saw tended toward walls of beige, white or light blue.\n\nSure, much was made of the spread of pheasant feathers on display. But other congressional offices are filled with trinkets, too \u2014 gee-gaws meant to evoke home, from a sign in Swedish bidding welcome to visitors in Illinois colleague Randy Hultgren\u2019s office (from Geneva, home of the Swedish Days festival) to the college pennants displayed by Cheri Bustos from all the institutions of higher learning in her district.\n\nThe Washington Post Style section article on Schock\u2019s office noted the presidential painting replicas in outsized frames, but missed the non-champion works from the annual 18th District congressional art competition. One incorporating a photo taken after the Washington tornado hangs just next to Schock\u2019s desk. And some of the furniture, including a sofa on which I sat during my first Capitol Hill interview with Schock in 2012, is left over from prior offices.\n\nSchock leans on history \u2014 old books and portraits of Founding Fathers and presidents like Grant and Lincoln from Illinois, the latter of whom held the same congressional seat 170 years ago.\n\nAs though the contrast with Honest Abe wasn\u2019t enough of an extreme on that day, it was hard as I left not to connect the current officeholder with the space as well: bright, bold and yet not quite living up to how each was advertised.\n\nChris Kaergard covers politics and Peoria County government for the Journal Star.
