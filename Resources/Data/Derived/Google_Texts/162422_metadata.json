Some, like Russell Moore of the Southern Baptist Convention, have argued that this is a time of clarity for Christians: It will become harder for evangelicals to blend into mass culture, and while that separation comes with costs, it may actually be a boon to the faith. Others, like the writer Rod Dreher, have suggested that conservatives may be forced into a sort of cultural withdrawal, a retreat into self-sustaining communities of people who share similar values. In a new book, Albert Mohler, the president of the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, offers a third way: stand up and debate, even on issues that seem to be moving toward an ever-firmer cultural consensus. In some ways, Mohler neatly fits the stereotype of an evangelical leader who has taken up a stand against queerness. He\u2019s white, he\u2019s male, he\u2019s Southern; he makes no apologies for his view that homosexuality is intertwined with sin. But he could also probably ace a Women and Gender Studies seminar. (He even once wrote an essay for The Atlantic on the Cosmopolitan editor Helen Gurley Brown.) In his book, We Cannot Be Silent, he cites sociologists like J\u00fcrgen Habermas and discusses television shows like Modern Family. He explores the difference between gender and sex and transgender and intersex.\n\nIt\u2019s a somewhat novel approach to being an evangelical in public life: engaging debates about sexuality on their own terms. As Mohler himself admits, this hasn\u2019t always been the case. \u201cWhile Christians were secure in a cultural consensus that was negative toward same-sex acts and same-sex relationships, we didn\u2019t have to worry too much about understanding our neighbors,\u201d he said. \u201cWe did horribly oversimplify the issue.\u201d Now that norms around LGBT issues are changing, evangelicals can no longer afford that kind of glibness, but it\u2019s tricky to balance civility with steadfastness. Mohler said he\u2019s not \u201ctrying to launch Culture War II,\u201d but he also doesn\u2019t want evangelicals to back down on their beliefs. \u201cChristians have not had to demonstrate patience, culturally speaking, in a very long time. The kind of work and witness we\u2019re called to\u2014it could take a very long time to show effects.\u201d The cultural project he\u2019s proposing is complicated, both intellectually and politically. But it\u2019s most complicated because it\u2019s uncomfortable. For so long, evangelical Christians implicitly owned American culture. Now, Mohler and co. are asking to be taken seriously by the new moral majority, whose lifestyles, marriages, and families they deeply oppose. * * * The idea that gender and sex are distinct is fairly new. In the United States, psychologists and social theorists began seriously developing \u201cgender theory\u201d\u2014roughly, the idea that male/femaleness is socially constructed, whereas sex is biologically determined\u2014in the late 1960s. This idea has become overwhelmingly accepted in American culture. It is embedded in terminology guidelines from medical groups like the American Medical Association and American Psychological Association; media organizations like the Associated Press; and, of course, LGBT advocacy organizations such as GLAAD. Related Story The Freakishness of Christianity For a long time, the culture-war opponents of homosexuality mocked or ignored the premises of gender theory. Ironically, this made it difficult to see the full depth of the intellectual fault lines between those who support homosexuality and those who oppose it on moral grounds. This is the usefulness of Mohler\u2019s translation project: Two sides of a cultural conflict, so long framed in different vocabulary, can be directly compared.\n\nMohler talks a lot about the rise of what he calls \u201cthe autonomous self\u201d\u2014the idea that people should be able to determine who they are and make their own choices about how and when they have sex. This is the basic premise of every gay-rights movement, but it\u2019s fundamentally at odds with the way Mohler and certain other evangelicals see the world. \u201c[People] want to know why biblically-minded Christians can\u2019t buy into the modern concept of sexual orientation as it\u2019s presented, or an understanding of gender as entirely socially constructed,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the distinction is actually more fundamental: It\u2019s whether or not we are autonomous selves who define our own identity, or whether we\u2019re creatures who are defined by a creator.\u201d \u201cChristians have not had to demonstrate patience, culturally speaking, in a very long time.\u201d Mohler\u2019s viewpoint depends on a fairly rigid moral universe, one in which people are commanded by God to act in a specific way, including when it comes to sex acts, wearing \u201cmale\u201d or \u201cfemale\u201d clothes, and embracing the gender identity associated with one\u2019s biological sex. He laments that American teens are surrounded by a \u201cpeer culture more committed to tolerance than any other moral principle,\u201d which highlights another fundamental tension: He believes self-derived morality is not sufficient, and that Christians have a moral obligation to guide the acts of others. Even though this way of thinking seems directly at odds with a self-derived sexual ethic, there are some counterintuitive echoes between Mohler\u2019s theological worldview and the vocabulary of the LGBT community. For example: When Mohler talks about the experience of brokenness, of recognizing one\u2019s own sinful nature, it sounds very similar to descriptions of gender dysphoria. This is the feeling that one\u2019s gender identity doesn\u2019t match with one\u2019s biological sex\u2014a common experience among transgender people. \u201cWe are indeed alienated from our true selves. In that sense, those who are struggling with the transgender issues, they aren\u2019t wrong. They\u2019re just being incredibly honest,\u201d Mohler said. \u201cAccording to the Bible, the world is not separated between those who are fully, wonderfully integrated selves, and those who are broken. No: The Bible says we are all broken.\u201d The difference, to Mohler, is what you choose to do about it. Many in the LGBT community would support a transgender person\u2019s decision to dress differently, carefully pursue hormone therapy, or get surgery. Mohler, on the other hand, believes \u201cwe find wholeness and resolution only in being the man or the woman that God meant us to be, or made us to be.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a strange kind of empathy: one that resolutely condemns the choices, lifestyles, and self-declared identities of LGBT people, but also resolutely affirms that their underlying struggle is real. Repeatedly in his book, Mohler calls on evangelicals to be more welcoming to people who feel an attraction to the same sex, or who feel that sense of gender dysphoria. \u201cWe must admit that Christians have sinned against transgender people and those struggling with such questions by simplistic explanations that do not take into account the deep spiritual and personal anguish of those who are in the struggle,\u201d he writes. Even this slight posture shift may be a big cultural change for many evangelicals, and one that won\u2019t come easily. Mohler\u2019s school, the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, hosted a panel discussion earlier this fall billed as the \u201cfirst evangelical conference on transgenderism.\u201d Some of the conversation followed Mohler\u2019s delicate model\u2014standing firm against queerness while still trying to understand and not mock it\u2014but other moments were rougher. A professor at the seminary, James M. Hamilton Jr., described visiting a college, somewhere in the SEC, and speaking to a group of young men. \u201cAnd the whole time, I\u2019m thinking to myself, these guys need to be told to man up \u2026 to stop looking like girls, in the way they walk, in the way they talk, in the way they wear their hats,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was all just, it was gross. I think it\u2019s our responsibility to say to the younger generation, \u2018You need to knock that off, and you need to start acting like a man.\u2019\u201d No offense to anyone, he added. While Mohler doesn\u2019t call anyone \u201cgross\u201d for being effeminate (or, as Hamilton put it, \u201cwhat [my wife] will call as \u2018floppiness\u2019\u201d), he does have his own few moments of tonal derision. He recommends using the term \u201chomosexual,\u201d rather than \u201cgay,\u201d because it \u201chas the advantage of speaking with sharp particularity to the actual issue at stake.\u201d And he dedicates a whole section of his book to proving that there was a \u201cgay agenda\u201d to legalize same-sex marriage and normalize homosexuality in American culture.\n\nBut he also recognizes\u2014mildly, mildly\u2014that there is wisdom to be drawn from questioning traditional norms of sexuality. Even though he firmly agrees that men and women should embrace the gender identity that matches their sex, \u201cWe do understand that a part of that is socially constructed,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd not only that, in a fallen world, there can be exaggerations and corruptions of what it means to be a man and a woman. There are some very brutalistic corruptions of masculinity, and there are some very trivial and hyper-sexualized understandings of the female that the Bible would clearly reject.\u201d \u201cThe transgender issues are going to be even more complex and challenging than same-sex marriage for the Christian church.\u201d When gay marriage became legal in the United States, there was a good deal of triumphalism within the LGBT community. Celebrations of a long-fought victory came with a sense of historical inevitability, that law and culture were always bound to one day affirm the equal rights of all couples to wed. Anyone who thinks cultural conflicts over sexuality and gender are settled, though, is badly mistaken. \u201cThe transgender issues are going to be even more complex and challenging than the same-sex relationships and same-sex marriage for the Christian church,\u201d Mohler said. \u201cThe transgender challenge isn\u2019t reducible merely to behaviors, in the sense [of] same-sex relationships with sexual acts\u2014that gets down to behavior pretty fast. But when it comes to transgender issues, the behaviors are a lot more nuanced. It\u2019s identity that\u2019s at the core.\u201d He cited a number of tangible complications that might arise out of the clash of different worldviews on transgender identity. Courts across the country are facing new questions of how to balance LGBT rights with religious liberty. Communities are wrestling with confusing challenges, like how schools should assign gender labels to bathrooms and how city governments should write gay-discrimination ordinances\u2014just this week, voters shot down a proposal for such a law in Houston. There\u2019s already been evidence that these conflicts aren\u2019t just theoretical or abstract: Look to the death of Leelah Alcorn, a transgender teen from Ohio who committed suicide this year, citing frustrations with the religious expectations of her parents. As new and more tangly legal and cultural conflicts related to gender identity arise, evangelicals face a choice about how to engage with the cultural majority. But those who support LGBT rights face a choice, too: How should they engage back?", "article_metadata": {"description": "The views of religiously conservative Americans no longer dominate U.S. culture or law.
