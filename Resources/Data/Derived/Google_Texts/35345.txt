Glenn Beck said that amid the upcoming decisions coming down from the Supreme Court, Americans need to know whether the rulings are “just another play to gain more control over you.”

“Some of the things that are happening at the Supreme Court — the consequences of these decisions and the reach of these decisions — have the capability to affect our daily life, and the decisions and things that you have grown accustomed to for decades,” Beck warned on his television program.

Among the cases Beck is watching are Obergefell vs. Hodges, which determines whether state legislatures have the ability to prohibit gay marriage, and King vs. Burwell, which could significantly impact Obamacare by ruling on whether federal subsidies are legal for those in states with no exchange.

Beck said he believes the Supreme Court’s decision last week to strike down a congressional ruling that allowed Americans born in Jerusalem to list Israel as their place of birth does not bode well for the rulings.

“I think we’re going to pay for this one,” Beck said. “I’m a faith guy. If you’re not, that’s totally cool. … [But] as a God guy, this is as big to me as when the Democrats denied God three times during their convention. That was just not a coincidence.”

“But there is a much bigger theme here that we need to look for, and that is the government is on a freight train of control,” Beck continued. “It is out of control, and picking up more and more steam.”
