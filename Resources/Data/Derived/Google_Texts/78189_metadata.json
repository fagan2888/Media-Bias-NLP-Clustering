Dershowitz and Prince Andrew denied the allegations, and the allegations were later stricken from court records.\n\nGiuffre was not a party to the defamation lawsuits or the settlement. A spokesman for the law firm of Boies, Schiller & Flexner, separate lawyers for her, said in a statement on Friday that she stands by her accusations.\n\nTwo of Giuffre's attorneys, Brad Edwards and Paul Cassell, had sued Dershowitz for defamation in a Broward County, Florida, state court after Dershowitz accused them of acting unethically. Dershowitz counter-sued.\n\nAs part of a settlement on Friday, Dershowitz withdrew his accusation that they acted unethically, and Edwards and Cassell said it was a mistake to have filed the accusations against Dershowitz. They added in a separate court filing on Friday that their mistake was tactical and that Giuffre stood by the accusations.\n\n\"Dershowitz completely denies any such misconduct, while not disputing Roberts\u2019s [Giuffre] statements that the underlying alleged misconduct may have occurred with someone else,\" the three lawyers said in the statement.\n\n\"Dershowitz has produced travel and other records for the relevant times which he relies on to establish that he could not have been present when the alleged misconduct occurred. He has also produced other evidence that he relies upon to refute the credibility of the allegations against him,\" they said.\n\nDershowitz, a Harvard Law School professor emeritus, may be best known for helping to successfully defend OJ Simpson against murder charges.\n\nFormer Federal Bureau of Investigation director Louis Freeh, whom Dershowitz hired to investigate Giuffre's accusations, said he found no evidence to support them and had found evidence directly contradicting them.\n\n\"In my opinion, the totality of the evidence found during the investigation refutes the allegations made against Professor Dershowitz,\" Freeh said in a statement.\n\n(Reporting by David Ingram in New York)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "(Reuters) - Prominent U.S.", "title": "Defamation lawsuits involving U.S. lawyer Dershowitz end in settlement", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/04/08/Defamation-lawsuits-involving-US-lawyer-Dershowitz-end-settlement", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-lawsuit-britain-royals_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/04/08/Defamation-lawsuits-involving-US-lawyer-Dershowitz-end-settlement", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-lawsuit-britain-royals_1.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "(Reuters) - Prominent U.S.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "As part of a settlement on Friday, Dershowitz withdrew his accusation that they acted unethically, and Edwards and Cassell said it was a mistake to have filed the accusations against Dershowitz.\nTwo of Giuffre's attorneys, Brad Edwards and Paul Cassell, had sued Dershowitz for defamation in a Broward County, Florida, state court after Dershowitz accused them of acting unethically.\nGiuffre was not a party to the defamation lawsuits or the settlement.\nDershowitz and Prince Andrew denied the allegations, and the allegations were later stricken from court records.\n\"In my opinion, the totality of the evidence found during the investigation refutes the allegations made against Professor Dershowitz,\" Freeh said in a statement."}
