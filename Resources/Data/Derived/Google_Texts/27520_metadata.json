The marketplace always tends to be somewhat choppier when you have these big geopolitical issues popping up. It\u2019s just one of several things they\u2019re going to need to navigate over the next six months,\u201d the analyst said.\n\nHEALTHY BRIDGE\n\nCitigroup and UBS are providing the 364-day senior unsecured bridge facility, according to regulatory filings. The bridge loan is expected to be taken out with permanent financing that could include a mix of term debt, bonds and commercial paper, sources said. Citigroup and UBS are currently syndicating a $3.2 billion, three-year term loan, the sources added.\n\nIf the merger clears antitrust scrutiny, it will dwarf the previous largest ever insurance deal announced in early July, when Swiss property and casualty giant ACE Ltd (ACE.N) said it was buying Chubb Corp (CB.N) for $28 billion, Reuters reported.\n\nIn the past two weeks, Anthem also has offered to buy Cigna Corp to create the largest insurer in the country, toppling UnitedHealth Group Inc, according to Reuters, as U.S. insurers grapple with the issue of providing universal coverage, which is a key policy of Barak Obama\u2019s presidency.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re through this tunnel of managing through at least the initial implementation phase of the ACA [Affordable Care Act],\u201d said the analyst. \u201cCompanies are now thinking more strongly about how they want to position in the next 3-5 years, and I think M&A will increasingly be a part of that thought process.\u201d\n\nThe acquisition gives Aetna a strong leg up in government-sponsored managed Medicare, a growth market in the health insurance sector, the analyst added. \u201cThis will vault them into a leadership position, assuming the deal goes through.\u201d\n\nThe bridge loan pricing is tied to a ratings grid, ranging from 75bp-125bp over Libor.\n\nPricing opens at 100bp over Libor based on Aetna\u2019s senior unsecured debt ratings of Baa1/A/A- and the loan pays a 10bp commitment fee. Pricing includes 25bp margin step-ups at 90, 180 and 270 days, respectively, after closing. The loan also pays duration fees, a periodic fee on the outstanding balance of the bridge loan, of 50bp, 75bp and 100bp, according to the same schedule.\n\nThe deal, which is expected to close in the second half of 2016, is also being financed through $3.4 billion of available cash, and $16 billion of new shares. Humana\u2019s existing debt of $3.8 billion will be assumed.\n\nAetna expects to maintain a solid investment grade rating and access to short-term debt markets. The company also expects to deleverage rapidly thanks to strong cash flow.\n\n(Editing By Tessa Walsh and Jon Methven)", "article_metadata": {"DCSext.ContentID_innovationNews": "USKCN0PJ2KI20150709",
