The House passed presumptive parole over heavy opposition from Attorney General Bill Schuette in 2015, but that bill doesn't look like it will make it through the Senate as a stand-alone bill. The Senate is looking at bigger pieces of the criminal justice system for reforms. Both chambers and Gov. Rick Snyder are eyeing 2016 for movement on the issue. Detroit Public Schools. Snyder has proposed splitting the district in two; a new district would educate kids while the old one would exist as a vehicle to collect taxes and pay down debt. But that plan comes with an ask of $715 million in state funds. Disagreements over where the money should come from, who should control the new district and how to pull it off without negatively impacting the Michigan's outstate students have plagued the issue, but Snyder is looking for action by March. House Speaker Kevin Cotter notably did not list it The energy overhaul. Michigan's energy laws are poised for an overhaul, but the legislature is still hammering out the details of what that might look like. Issues in contention include energy provider competition, renewable energy, energy efficiency, solar energy changes and competitive bidding of power plants. House legislation has moved out of committee and awaits floor action, while a Senate package is still in the Senate Energy and Technology Committee. With heavy utility pressure for a final measure and Gov. Rick Snyder asking for changes in the first half of the year, 2016 is likely the forum for energy changes. Marijuana. Multiple ballot proposals to legalize marijuana are vying for a spot on the 2016 ballot. Meanwhile, the legislature is considering changes to the medical marijuana industry that would regulate plants from seed to sale and allow non-smokable forms of the plant -- changes that could also happen in 2016. The budget. The state has to turn in a balanced budget, and lawmakers have delivered it several months early during Gov. Rick Snyder's tenure. This year's budget could still be impacted by big tax liabilities that changed the math last year. In addition there are several ongoing conversations with budget implications, including those over the Health Insurance Claims Assessment and Detroit Public Schools restructuring, that could get inserted into the annual debate. The Health Insurance Claims Assessment. The legislature is considering a bill to extend the life of the Health Insurance Claims Assessment, a fee levied on on health insurers and others to help Michigan match federal Medicaid dollars. The issue is coming to a head because the federal government is asking states to eliminate a supplementary use tax on medical services by the end of 2016. With HICA slated to end in 2017, that would create a funding hole. Legislators could fill that hole before it's created with a HICA extension in 2016. LGBT civil rights. The LGBT community is split over a ballot proposal to extend discrimination protections to LGBT folks by enshrining the issue in the constitution. The language won approval from the Board of State Canvassers in late December, and will circulate for signatures in 2016. Prevailing wage. There is a legislative appetite to repeal prevailing wage in the state which provides union-scale wages on publicly funded construction projects. But Gov. Rick Snyder has telegraphed that it's not a priority of his. The ballot proposal could essentially circumvent the governor, repealing prevailing wage by getting 252,523 signatures and submitting it to the legislature. The effort suffered from a signature snafu, but is making another push. Changes to the state's juvenile justice system. The House Criminal Justice Committee is considering a bipartisan package of bills that would stop automatically charging 17-year-olds as adults in Michigan and make changes to how youth are treated within the criminal justice system. Rep. Harvey Santana, D-Detroit, is working with House Criminal Justice Chair Rep. Kurt Heise, R-Plymouth Twp., on the bills. Santana said he'd like to work through the bills thoughtfully in 2016. Third grade reading. The proposed law would prevent schools from promoting students to fourth grade if they are behind a full grade level or more in reading. The proposal passed the House in October 2015, but awaits action in the Senate. Auto no-fault insurance. There was a lot of movement and then a lot of pausing for Senate Bill 248 in 2015, which would make changes to the state's no-fault insurance and standardize what auto insurers reimburse hospitals for treatment. House Speaker Kevin Cotter, R-Mt. Pleasant, named it as one of his top priorities for 2016. A study on the cost of education. Democrats won a bill requiring a study on the true cost of education as part of a compromise during the 2014 lame duck session. House Democratic Leader Tim Greimel, D-Auburn Hills, said he was looking forward to receiving the study in 2016 and using it as a basis for investing in school funding. Open carry in schools. The legislature took a peek at this issue in 2015, and currently Sen. Mike Green, R-Mayville, has a bill that would allow concealed carry in schools instead of the open carry of guns, which has caused unease among students and parents in some districts. But Gov. Rick Snyder vetoed a similar proposal in 2012, making it a politically interesting issue that could resurface in 2016. Other ballot proposals. Ballot proposals to ban fracking, mandate sick days and allow voting by mail could also gain traction in 2016. They're on our radar. The second Medicaid waiver. The federal government approved a second waiver last month for Michigan's expanded Medicaid program, but whether what was approved meets the state's standards could come into question. Sen. Patrick Colbeck is already questioning what he thinks may be inconsistencies. Healthy Michigan has historically been a contentious issue among Michigan's Republican legislators because of its ties to the Affordable Care Act. 'Dismemberment' abortion. The House Criminal Justice Committee in November approved a ban on a common second-trimester abortion technique where doctors disarticulate a fetus to remove it from the uterus. This could come up before the full House, and its strong contingent of pro-life members, in 2016.\n\nEmily Lawler is a Capitol/Business reporter for MLive.
