At a victory rally in Kiev, the 48-year-old said, \u201cThe first steps of our entire team at the beginning of the presidency will concentrate on ending the war, ending the chaos, ending the disorder and bringing peace to Ukrainian soil, to a united, single Ukraine. Our decisive actions will bring this result fairly quickly.\u201d\n\n\n\nVoter turnout was about 60%. The distant second-place candidate, Yulia Tymoshenko, said the democratic and fair election in the face of \u201cthe current aggression by the Kremlin\u201d was \u201cevidence of the strength of our nation.\u201d\n\nVoting was, however, severely disrupted in the restive east. Only 426 of 2,430 polling stations were open in Donetsk province, and no stations opened in the provincial capital, also called Donetsk. Polling booths failed to open in the city of Luhansk, a separatist stronghold.\n\nSome 20 people have died in battles with security forces in recent days, with insurgents having unilaterally declared independence from Ukraine. The region has been in turmoil since the popular ousting of President Viktor Yanukovych in February and the Russian annexation of Crimea in March.\n\nPoroshenko said he would strengthen ties with the E.U. and that he would never recognize Russia\u2019s \u201coccupation of Crimea.\u201d\n\nA day before the vote, Russian President Vladimir Putin said he would \u201ccooperate with the authorities that will come to power as a result of the election,\u201d however he added that he still considered Yanukovych to be Ukraine\u2019s legitimate President.\n\nFormer world-champion boxer Vitali Klitschko, who was one of the leading figures in the Euromaidan movement that brought down Yanukovych, claimed that he had won Kiev\u2019s politically significant mayoral election, also based on exit polls.", "article_metadata": {"apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0", "description": "Early Monday action by pro-Russian separatists confronts new President's promise to quickly end the conflict and create a united Ukraine", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "TIME.com", "description": "Early Monday hostilities by pro-Russian separatists have thrown down the gauntlet to the President-elect, who has promised to quickly end the conflict and create a single, united Ukraine.
