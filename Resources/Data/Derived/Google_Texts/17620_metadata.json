But who thanks those who refused to fight, even in wars that most people later realized were tragic mistakes? Consider the 2003 invasion of Iraq, now widely recognized as igniting an ongoing disaster. America\u2019s politicians still praise Iraq War veterans to the skies, but what senator has a kind word to say about the hundreds of thousands of protesters who marched and demonstrated before the invasion was even launched to try to stop our soldiers from risking their lives in the first place?\n\nWhat brings all this to mind is an apparently heartening exception to the rule of celebrating war-makers and ignoring peacemakers. A European rather than an American example, it turns out to be not quite as simple as it first appears. Let me explain.\n\nDecember 25th will be the 100th anniversary of the famous Christmas Truce of the First World War. You probably know the story: after five months of unparalleled industrial-scale slaughter, fighting on the Western Front came to a spontaneous halt. British and German soldiers stopped shooting at each other and emerged into the no-man\u2019s-land between their muddy trenches in France and Belgium to exchange food and gifts.\n\nThat story \u2014 burnished in recent years by books, songs, music videos, a feature film, and an opera \u2014 is largely true. On Christmas Day, troops did indeed trade cigarettes, helmets, canned food, coat buttons, and souvenirs. They sang carols, barbecued a pig, posed for photographs together, and exchanged German beer for British rum. In several spots, men from the rival armies played soccer together. The ground was pocked with shell craters and proper balls were scarce, so the teams made use of tin cans or sandbags stuffed with straw instead. Officers up to the rank of colonel emerged from the trenches to greet their counterparts on the other side, and they, too, were photographed together. (Refusing to join the party, however, was 25-year-old Adolf Hitler, at the front with his German army unit. He thought the truce shocking and dishonorable.)\n\nUnlike most unexpected outbreaks of peace, the anniversary of this one is being celebrated with extraordinary officially sanctioned fanfare. The British Council, funded in part by the government and invariably headed by a peer or knight, has helped distribute an \u201ceducation pack\u201d about the Truce to every primary and secondary school in the United Kingdom. It includes photos, eyewitness accounts, lesson plans, test questions, student worksheets, and vocabulary phrases in various languages, including \u201cMeet us halfway,\u201d \u201cWhat are your trenches like?,\u201d and \u201cCan I take your picture?\u201d The British post office has even issued a set of stamps commemorating the Christmas Truce.\n\nAn exhibit of documents, maps, uniforms, and other Truce-related memorabilia has been on display at city hall in Armenti\u00e8res, France. A commemorative youth soccer tournament with teams from Britain, Belgium, France, Austria, and Germany is taking place in Belgium this month. The local mayor and the British and German ambassadors were recently on hand for a soccer game at a newly dedicated \u201cFlanders Peace Field.\u201d\n\nVolunteers from several countries will spend three days and two nights in freshly dug trenches reenacting the Truce. Professional actors, complete with period uniforms, carol-singing, and a soccer match, have already done the same in an elaborate video advertisement for a British supermarket chain. One of the judges for a children\u2019s competition to design a Truce memorial is none other than Prince William, Duke of Cambridge.\n\nWhat Won\u2019t Be Commemorated\n\nGiven the rarity of peace celebrations of any sort, what\u2019s made the Christmas Truce safe for royalty, mayors, and diplomats? Three things, I believe. First, this event \u2014 remarkable, spontaneous, and genuinely moving as it was \u2014 did not represent a challenge to the sovereignty of war. It was sanctioned by officers on the spot; it was short-lived (the full fury of shelling and machine gunning resumed within a day or two, and poison gas and flamethrowers soon added to the horror); and it was never repeated. It\u2019s safe to celebrate because it threatened nothing. That supermarket video, for instance, advertises a commemorative chocolate bar whose sales proceeds go to the national veterans organization, the Royal British Legion.\n\nSecond, commemorating anything, even peace instead of war, is good business. Belgium alone expects two million visitors to former battle sites during the war\u2019s four-and-a-half-year centenary period, and has now added one or two peace sites as visitor destinations. The country is putting $41 million in public funds into museums, exhibits, publicity, and other tourism infrastructure, beyond private investment in new hotel rooms, restaurants, and the like.\n\nFinally, the Christmas Truce is tailor-made to be celebrated by professional soccer, now a huge industry. Top pro players earn $60 million or more a year. Two Spanish teams are each worth more than $3 billion. The former manager of Britain\u2019s Manchester United team, Sir Alex Ferguson, even teaches at the Harvard Business School. Five of the world\u2019s 10 most valuable teams, however, are in Britain, which helps account for that country\u2019s special enthusiasm for these commemorations. The Duke of Cambridge is the official patron of the sport\u2019s British governing body, the Football Association, the equivalent of our NFL. It has joined with the continent-wide Union of European Football Associations in promoting the Christmas Truce soccer tournament and other anniversary hoopla. That packet of material going to more than 30,000 British schools is titled \u201cFootball Remembers.\u201d\n\nWhile such sponsorship represents only a tiny percentage of the public relations budgets of these organizations, they have surely calculated that associating soccer with schoolchildren, Christmas, and a good-news historical event can\u2019t hurt business. All industries keep a close eye on their public image, and soccer especially so at the moment, since in many parts of Europe audiences for it are declining as a barrage of other activities competes for people\u2019s leisure time and spending.\n\nFor nearly four years, as we reach the centenary mark for one First World War milestone after another, there will be commemorations galore across Europe. But here\u2019s one thing you can bank on: the Duke of Cambridge and other high dignitaries won\u2019t be caught dead endorsing the anniversaries of far more subversive peace-related events to come.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Dec. 25 marks the 100th anniversary of the Christmas Truce.
