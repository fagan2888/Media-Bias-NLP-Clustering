Before Duane Reade\u2019s makeover, I never would have thought of it as a place to eat sushi, let alone grab a growler of beer. But drugstores are going through kind of an awkward transformation in their quest to be taken seriously as healthcare facilities. Still, even though many of these large retailers want to give you vaccines and help you manage your chronic condition, and CVS Heath ditched the smokes, they can\u2019t seem to let go of the candy and alcohol. Like I said. Awkward.\n\nBut the appetite for experimentation that the Affordable Care Act and HITECH Act ushered in has seen entrepreneurs try their hand at reshaping the pharmacy experience too. Pill Pack created a mail order pill dispensing business and then added a brick and mortar unit, for instance. It\u2019s more of a direct challenge to ZipDrug, particularly since both are focused on New York. Capsule seeks to ramp up the digital component in pharmacies.\n\nThe idea is to change the concept of pharmacies from the inside out. Although its brick and mortar presence in Chelsea is a big part of it, there\u2019s also an app. Users order their medication online and it\u2019s delivered by a bicycle courier to \u201cmost\u201d New York City locations. It claims to handle communication with insurers and physicians for things like refills and informs users before they order a prescription what it costs. It asks people ordering new medication to contact their physician to send their prescription to the business.\n\nThe brainchild of Eric Kinariwala and Sonia Patel, Capsule seeks to tackle the pain points of time-consuming waits to fill medication prescriptions and working out the logistical shortcomings that lead to out of stock prescriptions as essentials to improving that experience. Kinariwala, the CEO, had worked as an analyst with Bain Capital and, before that, Perry Capital. Patel previously was pharmacy manager at Sam\u2019s Club for eight years. It sees better communication between physicians and payers as one component to achieve that. It also delivers them to customers.\n\nTo solve the logistical issues that can lead to drugs being out of stock, it claims to have a predictive inventory system. Kinariwala and Patel spoke about their business, which launched this week, in a phone interview.\n\n\u201cThe technology we have built takes care of all these things \u2014 there is dynamic inventory management, population analysis and we\u2019re able to proactively do smart refills to make sure the meds are there,\u201d said Patel.\n\nKinariwala said it currently employs 20, but expects staff to grow as the business scales. \u201cWe put a lot of time and effort to building a technology team\u201d with backgrounds steeped in product design and engineering. \u201cThey know how to create a really compelling consumer experience.\u201d\n\n\u201cPharmacists are the victors in all of this,\u201d Patel said. She contrasted it approach with the big box retailers emphasizing their interest in giving pharmacists more authority.\n\nShe added, \u201cI learned over time the pain points that pharmacies and pharmacists have to deal with. Understaffed pharmacies can impact. They don\u2019t give the attention to patients that they deserve.\u201d\n\nFYI, there is also an app called Capsule in Quebec that is all about filling prescriptions in Quebec. It\u2019s easy to get confused.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how Capsule Pharmacy evolves in the face of growing competition both from other startups and drug store retailers interest in pivoting between treating customers as patients as well.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The co-founders of Capsule Pharmacy want to eliminate the inventory problems and delays in filling prescription medication.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "MedCity News", "description": "The co-founders of Capsule Pharmacy want to eliminate the inventory problems and delays in filling prescription medication.", "title": "Is this the Uber of pharmacies?
