The country \u201cdoes not have a living memory [of statehood].\u201d\n\nThis hurt in two ways, he said. First, because of the historical conflicts, almost all of Ukraine\u2019s neighbors have a claim against what is now Ukrainian territory, including Russia.\n\nSecond, Ukraine\u2019s foray into self-government stumbled along lines predictable for a country with little history of self-governance. After the breakup of the Soviet Union, he said, an oligarchy rose in Ukraine, similar to the one in Russia. Once in charge, the oligarchs \u201cfixed the political system\u201d to ensure their own success.\n\nAccording to Rumer, the sentiment against Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych and the old guard of politicians reached its peak when Yanukovych walked away from the Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area agreement with the European Union. Yanukovych abandoned the agreement, which would have brought Ukraine closer to Europe, after being bribed by Moscow and Russian President Vladimir Putin. He then fled to Russia as the uprising worsened.\n\nBut others share in the blame, he said. Ukraine\u2019s leaders were trying to game both Brussels and Moscow. The EU leaders in charge of the trade agreement were critical of Putin, leading to distrust in the Kremlin. The Russians\u2019 \u201cknee-jerk reaction\u201d to invade Ukraine after the deal fell through was a \u201cbridge too far.\u201d\n\nAnd the United States, he said, was \u201cnowhere to be seen\u201d at the crisis\u2019 critical moments because of its focus on the Middle East.\n\n\u201cThe costs that everyone is paying for this is terrible,\u201d said Rumer, who concluded saying damages and reconstruction of Ukraine will cost billions.\n\nThe failures of U.S. foreign policy continue in the region, James Carafano, vice president of the Kathryn and Shelby Cullom Davis Institute for National Security and Foreign Policy, told The Daily Signal\n\n\u201cWhat remains shockingly apparent is that almost no one believes the White House has any serious strategy on how to deal with Putin,\u201d Carafano said. \u201cThat\u2019s a very worrying assessment since it is clear that none of the parties to the conflict have a clue how this plays out. We have a situation where each side is playing with fire in the heart of Europe, and the U.S. continues to look on like a bemused bystander.\n\n\u201cIt is also clear that Putin has complete disdain for President Obama. That\u2019s an equally shocking development given that the administration placed so much face in the Russian reset to address U.S.-Russian relations. Yet, we are in the moment where something like the reset could really prove its worth\u2014and its pretty clear the reset was worthless. Obama invested so much and got more than a negative return.\u201d\n\nRumer said the whole world was taken by surprise by what happened in Ukraine. He said he visited the country in 2013 and saw no signs of what was to come.\n\n\u201cThere was no indication\u2026that this country and certainly the city of Kyiv would erupt in mass uprising,\u201d Rumer said.\n\nThen why? Because, Rumer said, people in Kyiv were \u201cfed up\u201d with all politicians, even the reformers.", "article_metadata": {"description": "In Ukraine, the crisis is messy, the solutions elusive and the outlook bleak.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "In Ukraine, the crisis is messy, the solutions elusive and the outlook bleak.", "title": "Why Ukraine Is a Mess and How It Got There", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/epalive546128.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-03-16T14:44:41+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1GwiMlS"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "In Ukraine, the crisis is messy, the solutions elusive and the outlook bleak.", "title": "Why Ukraine Is a Mess and How It Got There", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/epalive546128.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "International", "tag": "Ukraine", "published_time": "2015-03-14T03:01:46+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-03-16T14:44:41+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Ukraine, Putin, Russia, United States, European Union"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcaf49\"", "article_summary": "Yanukovych abandoned the agreement, which would have brought Ukraine closer to Europe, after being bribed by Moscow and Russian President Vladimir Putin.\nAfter the breakup of the Soviet Union, he said, an oligarchy rose in Ukraine, similar to the one in Russia.\nIn Ukraine, the crisis is messy, the solutions elusive and the outlook bleak.\n\u201cThe costs that everyone is paying for this is terrible,\u201d said Rumer, who concluded saying damages and reconstruction of Ukraine will cost billions.\n\u201cThe history [of Ukraine] \u2026 [is one] that lacks a traditional statehood,\u201d Rumer said."}
