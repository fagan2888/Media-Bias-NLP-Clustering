So here goes.\n\n\n\nThe U.S. has seen a record level of job growth not seen since 1999. The unemployment rate is lower than it was before the financial crisis hit the U.S. economy. Since 2009, we've seen the deficit reduced by two-thirds when broken down as a percentage of GDP. The Dow is hovering around 18,000, which greatly eclipses the putrid mark of 7,949 on Jan. 20, 2009.\n\nCorporate profits are way up. Gas prices are way down, despite GOP claims that our dependence on foreign oil would weaken our national security and put gas prices over $5 per gallon. Two wars started by the president's predecessor have been ended without starting a new one. And Osama bin Laden is dead.\n\n\n\nThis president helped speed up social change by embracing marriage equality, throwing DOMA (the Defense of Marriage Act) in the garbage and ending \"Don't Ask, Don't Tell.\" He supports women's reproductive rights and equal pay. The Affordable Care Act has given more than 12 million people access to health care. Using his executive authority after the House failed to act on the issue, the president allowed up to 5 million undocumented immigrants to apply for relief from deportation.\n\n\n\nThese accomplishments are significant despite opposition determined to obstruct his every move and refusing to do their jobs. To be honest, coming off arguably one of the most disastrous presidencies in our history, there wasn't any place to go but up.\n\n\n\nWhat matters, and what alone matters, are the results.\n\n-- Vincent Graziano,\n\nHamilton\n\n\n\nFollow The Times of Trenton on Twitter @TimesofTrenton.
