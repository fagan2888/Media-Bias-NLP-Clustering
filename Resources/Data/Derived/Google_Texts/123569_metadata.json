We won\u2019t get a clearer trading picture until Wednesday afternoon when the Fed Oracle speaks.\n\nWASHINGTON, June 15, 2015 \u2013 It looks like we\u2019re back to Blue Mondays on Wall Street these days. U.S. stocks were hit hard at the opening Monday morning.\n\nThe morning damage was virtually across the boards, with selling spurred by uncertainty surrounding the Trans Pacific free trade legislation, increasing prospects for an unpleasant \u201cGrexit\u201d finale to the Eurozone\u2019s never-ending Greek problem and the overwhelming fear of impending rate hike news coming out of Wednesday\u2019s Federal Reserve musings.\n\nThe latter fear would appear to be greatly exaggerated at this point, as bonds seem to have been in recovery mode since late last week\u2014possibly an indication that things have gotten a little oversold in the debt markets. But no matter. When the HFTs and the algos decide to hit that sell button, it\u2019s Katie Bar the Door time.\n\nThe Greek thing is what it is. But the ability of various Greek governments and the eurozone to kick the can down the road is beginning to make that whole scenario look a whole lot like Bill Murray\u2019s timeline in \u201cGroundhog Day.\u201d\n\nAs for that Trans Pacific (TPP) package\u2026 Free trade is generally good for business. But even free traders like the Maven just don\u2019t like all that secret crap that\u2019s sitting in a basement office on Capitol Hill. We\u2019ve already had one disaster from Obamacare, which the Democrats passed to see what was in it. Why pull this farcical secret nonsense on the public again? You\u2019d think the politicians and oligarchs were running this country, right? Well, yeah, right.\n\nDon\u2019t get the Maven started.\n\nAs of 1 p.m. EDT Monday, the Dow Jones Industrials (DJI), which had been off well over 150 points, had recovered somewhat, down under 100 points. But as of 1:30 p.m. as we write this, the DJI is moving in reverse once again, down over 115. The broader based S&P 500 is off about 10 and the NASDAQ has been hit fairly hard, currently down nearly 26.\n\nIn short, if you\u2019re long anything, you\u2019re not a happy camper this afternoon.\n\nOur reports will be on the short side today, tomorrow and Wednesday morning, given that this nonsense is likely to persist, at least until the Fed reveals its current non-committal, murky thoughts. That usually happens around 2 p.m. on Fed Wednesdays.\n\nUntil then, uncertainty looms large, meaning thin trading that gyrates at the mercy of headlines and rumors, courtesy of those headline- and rumor-driven HFT morons. That makes any kind of trade treacherous for us little guys, so it\u2019s best to stay out of the way of the trading machines, which tend to react to nearly everything like the Incredible Hulk when he\u2019s particularly freaked out.\n\nNo trading tips today. But if you\u2019re in one of the short S&P 500 ETFs\u2014SH (regular short S&P) or SDS (double-short S&P), you might consider putting some more on if we don\u2019t see some happy talk soon. But also be prepared to reduce these positions Wednesday afternoon if the Fed says something nice.\n\n* Cartoon by Branco, originally appearing on NetRightDaily, linked here.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Monday markets are haunted again by nameless fears with names.
