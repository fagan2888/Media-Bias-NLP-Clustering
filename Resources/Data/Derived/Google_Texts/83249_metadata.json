The New England Patriots, for example, received about $675,000 to hold pre-game ceremonies for soldiers and veterans. The Denver Broncos were paid about $460,000.\n\nThe Senators slammed the payments saying it\u2019s a waste of tax dollars that could be used on something more valuable like counseling for soldiers returning home.\n\nRelated: Pentagon\u2019s Failure to Audit Contracts Wastes Billions\n\nUnder the amendment, the Pentagon would be required to provide a full list of all professional sports teams, not just football, that have received similar payments. A similar bill approved by the House last month requires the money be allocated to research for post-traumatic stress disorder, the National Journal reported.\n\nThe amendment comes as the Senate considers the 2016 National Defense Authorization Act approved by the House last month that would allocate $612 billion in government funding for the Pentagon.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The Pentagon pays some professional football teams including the New England Patriots", "title": "NFL Billed Taxpayers $7 Million to Honor Vets at Games", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/06/05/NFL-Billed-Taxpayers-7-Million-Honor-Vets-Games", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/08302012_fantasy_football_money_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/06/05/NFL-Billed-Taxpayers-7-Million-Honor-Vets-Games", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/08302012_fantasy_football_money_article.jpg", "creator": "@Briannaehley", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "The Pentagon pays some professional football teams including the New England Patriots", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "According to McCain, the DOD has paid NFL organizations roughly $7 million over the past three years.\nBut that agreement between the NFL and the Pentagon may soon be coming to an end.\nThe New England Patriots, for example, received about $675,000 to hold pre-game ceremonies for soldiers and veterans.\nA similar bill approved by the House last month requires the money be allocated to research for post-traumatic stress disorder, the National Journal reported.\nRelated: Pentagon\u2019s Failure to Audit Contracts Wastes BillionsUnder the amendment, the Pentagon would be required to provide a full list of all professional sports teams, not just football, that have received similar payments."}
