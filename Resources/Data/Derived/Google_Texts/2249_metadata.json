Of those, 115 drugs had a total program spending of $76.7 billion, representing 63 percent of program spending.\n\n[Also: CMS spent $103 billion on Medicare Part D in 2013]\n\nThe 15 drugs topping spending account for $29.1 billion and 24 percent of program spending.\n\nCMS shows 540 represents drugs had a 25 percent cost increase for $13.7 billion, or 11 percent of program costs.\n\nThe Part D drug, Humira, used to treat rheumatoid arthritis, had more than 50,000 beneficiaries using it in 2014, with total annual Part D spending per user of approximately $24,000 and total spending of $1.2 billion, CMS said.\n\nIn comparison, about 33,000 beneficiaries were using Sovaldi, which is used to treat Hepatitis C infections, with total annual spending per user of $94,000 and total Part D spending of $3.1 billion.\n\nFor Part B, 606 drugs represent $21.5 billion in spending, with 21 representing the highest spending at $12.8 billion, or 60 percent of program costs.\n\nThe top 15 highest spending drugs totalled $11.5 billion, and represented more than half, 53 percent of program costs.\n\nFor all drugs included on the list, CMS is displaying relevant spending, utilization, and trend data and also drug product descriptions, manufacturers, and clinical indications.\n\nFor the dashboard, CMS identified 40 drugs provided through the Medicare Prescription Drug Program under Part D and 40 drugs administered by physicians and other professionals in the Medicare fee-for-service program under Part B.\n\nThe drugs are selected because they rank in the top 15 in terms of total program spending or they are associated with a high annual per user spending based on claims data analysis.\n\nThe relatively small set of medications presented on the dashboard represents a very large proportion of program spending, including 33 percent of all Part D spending and 71 percent of Part B drug spending in 2014, CMS said.\n\nHere is the full spending data on the 80 selected drugs, from CMS:\n\n\n\n\n\nBrand Generic Name Coverage Type Total Spending Beneficiary Count Unit Count Beneficiary Cost Share Annual Spending Per User Avg Cost Per Unit Average Annual Beneficiary Cost Share Claim Count Brand Generic Name Coverage Type Total Spending Beneficiary Count Unit Count Beneficiary Cost Share Annual Spending Per User Avg Cost Per Unit Average Annual Beneficiary Cost Share Claim Count Abilify Aripiprazole Part D $2,527,319,031.60 405,161 88,198,691 $49,598,419.68 $6,237.83 $28.65 * 2,964,075 Abraxane Paclitaxel Protein-Bound Part B $276,345,661.22 17,733 29,216,874 $55,960,035.18 $15,583.69 $9.46 $3,155.70 124,144 Activase;
