A quarter century later, MET still a tough sell

The Michigan Education Trust was announced by Gov. James Blanchard in his 1986 State of the State Address with the idea of encouraging parents to lock in current tuition rates — however high — before they climb even higher.



Considered at the time a revolutionary way of making college affordable, the MET started in 1988 by selling about 40,000 contracts for a total of $265 million, according to Robin Lott, executive director of the MET. That's an average of about $6,625 each.



Even though statewide university enrollment has increased by 24 percent to about 267,000 students from about 216,000 in the last 20 years, the number of MET contracts purchased has remained comparatively stagnant, fluctuating between 1,400 in 1995 to a peak of 4,500 in 2003.



Why?



"My board asks me that every year, and I can't answer that definitively," Lott said.



But at least part of the problem has been convincing people that the MET is a good way to save money on college education, she said, especially in an era when other 529 plans are widely available.





How the MET works

The MET — which only requires that beneficiaries be Michigan residents — offers three different plans:



• Full benefits, which covers tuition (up to 120 credit hours) and fees at any of Michigan's 15 public universities or 28 community colleges.



• Limited benefits, which covers up to 120 credit hours of tuition and mandatory fees at public universities or community college whose tuition is not greater than 105 percent of the weighted average tuition of all Michigan public universities, which means less than full coverage for public schools that cost more than that.



• Community college plan, which covers up to two years of in-district tuition and mandatory fees at any public community college.



The MET — which does not cover room, board or book costs and can be paid over four, seven, 10 or 15 years — has sold 101,000 contracts to date.





How the MET is invested

When the program began, it locked in an investment vehicle with a hefty rate of return of 9.75 percent, consistent with the high interest rates of the time, affording the MET board the luxury of offering packages at lower prices.



But fast-forward a little more than a quarter century. Interest rates have fallen to near-zero and tuition rates are rising faster. Lott said the current rate-of-return assumption is 6 percent.



In September, the MET board approved assumptions of 7.1 percent tuition increases through 2017 and then 4.5 percent tuition increases after that, according to an actuarial analysis by Southfield-based Gabriel Roeder Smith & Co.



Lott said the increases are directly tied to spiking tuition rates at Michigan's 15 public universities, the trust's need to be solvent and the majority of the 9,155 students with MET contracts attending the state's three costliest universities: Michigan Technological University (193), the University of Michigan (1,941) and Michigan State University (2,634).
