Lawmakers in Nigeria recently banned same-sex marriage, with one senator saying that although Nigeria has \u201cmany shortcomings,\u201d it won\u2019t add \u201cthis one to it.\u201d In Uganda, lawmakers enacted long prison sentences for homosexual touching, promotion and even failing to report such violations.\n\nIn India, the Supreme Court threw out a 2009 law that decriminalized gay sex, essentially reinstating a 19th-century law that bans \u201csex against the order of nature.\u201d\n\nThese developments, plus violence against gays in the Arab world and some African countries, show \u201cthe huge, huge amount\u201d that is left to do for gay rights, Mr. Wolfson said.\n\nOrganizations that support man-woman marriage also are fortifying their positions and alliances.\n\nThe World Congress of Families, which holds regular conferences on restoring \u201cthe natural family as the fundamental social unit\u201d and \u201cseedbed\u201d of civil society, met in Moscow in September.\n\nThe conference\u2019s focus was rebuilding interest in large families \u2014 a priority in countries where women often have one or no children. But it also defended Russian political leaders for enacting a law prohibiting \u201cpropaganda\u201d to minors about \u201cnontraditional sexual relationships.\u201d\n\nHomosexual conduct has been legal in Russia since 1993, and the new law doesn\u2019t change that, World Congress of Families managing director Larry Jacobs said in a newsletter. But it means \u201cadults can\u2019t try to corrupt children by encouraging experimentation which could have life-threatening consequences.\u201d\n\nThe Russian law has sparked international attention as the city of Sochi prepares to host the Winter Olympics in February. Gay-rights activists are calling for boycotts of the games, or actions that defy the law, and President Obama recently asked tennis champion \u2014 and open lesbian \u2014 Billie Jean King to join the U.S. Olympic delegation at the opening ceremonies.\n\nIn his recent State of the Nation speech, however, Russian President Vladimir Putin said \u201ctraditional values\u201d were the foundation of Russia\u2019s greatness and a bulwark against \u201cso-called tolerance \u2014 genderless and infertile.\u201d He also chided the West for treating \u201cgood and evil\u201d equally and lamented the \u201creview of norms of morality\u201d in other nations, according to The Associated Press.\n\nIn Massachusetts, the traditional values group Mass Resistance has found that its materials \u2014 including a video on what same-sex marriage \u201cdid to Massachusetts\u201d \u2014 have been of interest to people in Australia, the United Kingdom, France and, recently, Jamaica, said Brian Camenker, president of the group.\n\nIn America, gay-rights groups were able to conduct a \u201cblitzkrieg\u201d in some states, thanks to deep-pocketed benefactors and political allies, he said.\n\nOverseas gay-rights advocates \u201cjust don\u2019t have that enormous advantage,\u201d Mr. Camenker said. \u201cSo that sort of holds them back.\u201d\n\nAlthough the push started in earnest in 1990 in Hawaii, the Netherlands became the first country to legalize gay marriage in 2000.\n\nEighteen countries permit same-sex nuptials either nationwide or in certain jurisdictions, says a report by the Pew Research Center\u2019s Religion and Public Life Project. These include several European countries, as well as Canada, South Africa and Argentina.\n\nIn England and Wales, gay marriages will begin in March. In the rest of the United Kingdom, Scotland is debating a gay-marriage measure and Northern Ireland has voted one down, the Pew report says.\n\nIn Brazil, same-sex marriages have commenced under a ruling from the National Council of Justice, but there is \u201cuncertainty\u201d there because of resistance from legal or political directions, it added.\n\nIn the U.S., 17 states \u2014 now including New Mexico \u2014 and the District of Columbia permit same-sex marriage, thanks to this banner year in which eight states joined the gay-marriage column.\n\nA global gay-rights network called the International Lesbian Gay Bisexual Trans and Intersex Association has been active for decades, and the D.C.-based Human Rights Campaign has said it would be increasing its international efforts.\n\n\u201cExpanding HRC\u2019s ability to work in coalition with international LGBT human rights defenders will hasten the day when LGBT people are free from hate-based violence and equality is a reality for all,\u201d the group\u2019s president, Chad Griffin, said in November as part of an announcement that the Paul E. Singer Foundation and Daniel S. Loeb Family Foundation had given major gifts to fight discrimination in foreign countries.\n\nMr. Wolfson, referring to the days in the 1990s when he and lawyer Dan Foley assisted three gay couples in their battle for marriage licenses in Hawaii, said it has been a long journey.\n\nStill, he said, \u201cit is very exciting and gratifying to see that what we began in Hawaii has launched an ongoing, global movement.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The sharp divisions among the states on gay marriage in the U.S. are being repeated on the global stage, with some countries rushing ahead to approve such unions but others &mdash; including India, Russia, Australia and Uganda \u2014 moving in the opposite direction.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "The sharp divisions among the states on gay marriage in the U.S. are being repeated on the global stage, with some countries rushing ahead to approve such unions but others \u2014 including India, Russia, Australia and Uganda \u2014 moving in the opposite direction.", "title": "Gay marriage makes a world of differences in a defining year", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/dec/25/gay-marriage-makes-a-world-of-differences/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2013/12/24/gay-marriage-utahjpeg-0b9af.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2013/12/24/gay-marriage-utahjpeg-0b9af.jpg", "description": "The sharp divisions among the states on gay marriage in the U.S. are being repeated on the global stage, with some countries rushing ahead to approve such unions but others &mdash; including India, Ru", "card": "summary", "title": "Gay marriage makes a world of differences in a defining year"}, "Author": "Cheryl Wetzstein", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9961\"", "article_summary": "This year alone, he noted, the far-flung nations of Brazil, France, Uruguay, New Zealand, and England and Wales legalized same-sex marriage.\nOn Dec. 1, more than 65 percent of voters in Croatia approved a constitutional amendment against same-sex marriage.\nWhat is the state of gay marriage internationally?\n\u201cSo that sort of holds them back.\u201dAlthough the push started in earnest in 1990 in Hawaii, the Netherlands became the first country to legalize gay marriage in 2000.\nIn the U.S., 17 states \u2014 now including New Mexico \u2014 and the District of Columbia permit same-sex marriage, thanks to this banner year in which eight states joined the gay-marriage column."}
