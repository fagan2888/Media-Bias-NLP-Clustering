Vidant officials said the move was necessary as a consequence of North Carolina\u2019s refusal to participate in Obamacare\u2019s optional Medicaid expansion.\n\nBelhaven is a small town of 1,688 where more than 55 percent of the population is African-American and approximately 28 percent of residents live in poverty. Vidant Pungo bills itself as \u201ca private, not-for-profit 49-bed acute care hospital on the waterfront in Belhaven\u201d that \u201cprovides medical care to patients in eastern Beaufort and Hyde counties, serving approximately 25,000 people with a service area of approximately 1,260 square miles.\u201d In those counties, more than 19 percent and 25 percent of residents respectively live below the poverty level, according to the latest census data.\n\nSince safety-net hospitals that serve regions with high numbers of poor and uninsured people often have patients who can\u2019t afford to pay for their care, they usually have to rely on the government to pick up some of the tab for uncompensated medical treatment to stay financially viable. But Obamacare reduced reimbursements to these so-called \u201cdisproportionate share hospitals\u201d (DSHs) \u2014 one of which is Vidant Pungo \u2014 since the law originally intended all states to expand Medicaid for every American living up to 133 percent of the Federal Poverty Level. If things had unfolded that way, these hospitals wouldn\u2019t need the additional government payments since their patients would finally be able to pay for their own care through Medicaid.\n\nBut the Supreme Court ruled the expansion to be optional last summer. That\u2019s why hospitals have intensely lobbied state officials to expand Medicaid, since the combination of uninsured patients and reduced federal reimbursements could spell financial doom for them. Unfortunately, at least 21 states with GOP governors or legislatures \u2014 including North Carolina \u2014 opposed to the health law have refused generous federal funding to expand Medicaid eligibility.\n\nThe federal government took steps in May to soften the blow to DSHs by tying how much states\u2019 reimbursements for uncompensated care will be cut with their uninsurance rates \u2014 i.e., the larger uninsured population a state has, the less its DSH funding will be cut. But this is merely a fiscal band-aid, not a permanent solution. And as Vidant Pungo\u2019s imminent shuttering demonstrates, some hospitals simply aren\u2019t willing to risk the uncertainty.\n\nExpanding Medicaid would cut North Carolina\u2019s uninsurance rate by more than 48 percent.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "Vidant Pungo Hospital in Belhaven, North Carolina serves a population filled with poor Americans.
