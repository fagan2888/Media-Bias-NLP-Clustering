John Kasich wants to use part of the federal act to expand Medicaid in Ohio despite the opposition of GOP bitter-enders in the General Assembly. The latter seem to forget that the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the Affordable Care Act. They also forget Ohioans have twice now voted to make, and keep, Barack Obama, the Affordable Care Act\u2019s prime mover, president.\n\nAlso to Kasich\u2019s credit, he has deployed what is probably the best health-care policy team an Ohio governor has fielded. To cite just one example, Kasich\u2019s administration on Tuesday premiered a new website, Benefits.Ohio.Gov, which can help Ohioans learn if they might be eligible for Medicaid or should shop for coverage in the new marketplace. Tuesday\u2019s rollout is phase one of a new self-service Ohio Benefits portal and Integrated Eligibility system devised by Kasich\u2019s Office of Health Transformation and the state Medicaid Department.\n\nStill, Kasich -- the governor who wants to expand Medicaid, using the Affordable Care Act -- refused the chance to set up an Ohio insurance exchange, as also authorized by the act. Ohioans instead must resort to a federal exchange, though Ohio Republicans usually claim that government that\u2019s closest to voters -- state and local government -- is the best government.\n\nMeanwhile, the state Insurance Department, led by Kasich\u2019s lieutenant governor, suburban Akron Republican Mary Taylor, seemingly wants as little as possible to do with the Affordable Care Act. Taylor has all but prophesied that the law won\u2019t work. Still, Tuesday afternoon her department approved the Ohio Association of Foodbanks\u2019 application to operate a navigator program; the association thanked \u201cTaylor and [her] department\u2019s dedicated staff for their consideration [and] hard work.\u201d\n\nAlso as of Tuesday, if an Ohioan squinted, he or she could find on the Insurance Department\u2019s website, in a column headed \u201cFeatured Links,\u201d a \u201cFederal Health Reform FAQ\u201d tab. That \"Frequently Asked Questions\" tab offers a link to the federal exchange, but not much else.\n\nAbout our editorials Plain Dealer editorials express the view of the Plain Dealer editorials express the view of the editorial board -- the publisher, editor and editorial-writing staff.

With votes from some of the legislature\u2019s Democrats, the Ohio House and state Senate passed Substitute House Bill 3. The measure requires certification, by the state government, of Affordable Care Act \u201cnavigators\u201d \u2013 people who\u2019ll offer consumer-friendly information to Ohioans shopping for coverage in the health insurance marketplaces (exchanges) that the act creates.\n\nThere are several salient points to consider about House Bill 3. First, Congress, when in 2010 it passed the Affordable Care Act, required federal certification of navigators. Congress did not, however, require the states to certify navigators. House Bill 3 does so anyway, though Republicans always claim they favor less regulation, not more. In effect, House Bill 3 makes prospective Ohio navigators clear more hurdles than necessary.\n\nSecond, House Bill 3 forbids hospitals to be navigators if (as virtually all do) they receive payments (for example, for patient care) from health insurers. Yet next to insurers themselves, it\u2019s difficult to imagine which Ohio enterprises could know more about health insurance coverage (and gaps) than hospitals. Meanwhile, the Kasich administration declined to apply for a federal consumer assistance grant that could have provided Ohioans with more navigators than it will likely have without the grant.\n\nYes, the Affordable Care Act is overly complex. That\u2019s because Obama, to get any meaningful law passed, agreed to work with America\u2019s insurance lobbies rather than seek a single-payer mechanism. It\u2019s just as fair to say that political enemies of the president, and of the act, would rather magnify and maximize its complexity to discredit him -- and it. That is, partisans, to score debating points, want to put consumers in a crossfire, rather than serve them.\n\nTrying to sabotage the law -- and it is the law of the land -- by slowing its implementation, failing to provide adequate consumer guidance, currying fear in the public or making it harder for those tasked with \"navigating\" average people through the sign-up process shows a pettiness and lack of concern for the taxpaying public that are truly shocking. It is time that Ohio came together to make sure that its citizens who need health insurance understand they now have the chance to obtain it, and that they also know how to go about doing so.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "'health-insurance','john-kasich','medicaid-expansion','obamacare','obamacare-navigators','substitute-house-bill-3'", "title": "As Obamacare takes effect, Ohio is making it unnecessarily difficult to participate: editorial", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"As Obamacare takes effect, Ohio is making it unnecessarily difficult to participate: editorial\", \"link\": \"http://www.cleveland.com/opinion/index.ssf/2013/10/as_obamacare_takes_effect_ohio.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://imgick.cleveland.com/home/cleve-media/width620/img/opinion_impact/photo/13506784-standard.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"11348455\", \"pub_date\": \"2013-10-01T21:39:57Z\", \"author\": \"Editorial Board\", \"tags\": [\"health-insurance\",\"john-kasich\",\"medicaid-expansion\",\"obamacare\",\"obamacare-navigators\",\"substitute-house-bill-3\"] }", "twitter": {"image": "http://media.cleveland.com/opinion_impact/photo/13506784-thumb_square_large.jpg", "description": "Now that citizens can start signing up for health insurance under the Affordable Care Act, Ohio officials should begin helping taxpayers to do so instead of naysaying and impeding the law, the editorial board writes.", "card": "summary", "site": "@clevelanddotcom"}, "article_date_updated": "Tuesday, October 01, 2013,  6:32 PM", "parsely-metadata": "{\"short_title\": \"\", \"image_url\": \"http://media.cleveland.com/opinion_impact/photo/obamacarejpg-84433555ca61a9cd.jpg\", \"author_name\": \"neomgeditorial\", \"author_nickname\": \"Editorial Board\", \"author_id\": \"10948997\", \"source_blog_name\": \"Opinion, Editorials, Letters and Columns\", \"source_blog_url\": \"http://www.cleveland.com/opinion/index.ssf/\", \"sponsored_content\": \"0\" }", "og": {"site_name": "cleveland.com", "description": "Now that citizens can start signing up for health insurance under the Affordable Care Act, Ohio officials should begin helping taxpayers to do so instead of naysaying and impeding the law, the editorial board writes.", "title": "As Obamacare takes effect, Ohio is making it unnecessarily difficult to participate: editorial", "url": "http://www.cleveland.com/opinion/index.ssf/2013/10/as_obamacare_takes_effect_ohio.html", "image": "http://www.cleveland.com/static/aff/static/img/logos/logo_fb.jpg", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "cleveland.com", "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Tuesday, October 01, 2013,  5:39 PM", "article_author": "Editorial Board", "Description": "Now that citizens can start signing up for health insurance under the Affordable Care Act, Ohio officials should begin helping taxpayers to do so instead of naysaying and impeding the law, the editorial board writes."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe166b\"", "article_summary": "For their part, earlier this year, Ohio\u2019s Republican-run General Assembly made Affordable Care Act implementation unnecessarily complex.\nThe latter seem to forget that the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the Affordable Care Act.\nWith votes from some of the legislature\u2019s Democrats, the Ohio House and state Senate passed Substitute House Bill 3.\nYet next to insurers themselves, it\u2019s difficult to imagine which Ohio enterprises could know more about health insurance coverage (and gaps) than hospitals.\nYes, the Affordable Care Act is overly complex."}
