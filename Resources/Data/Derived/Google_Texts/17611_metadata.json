It isn\u2019t even always depression. A fast-growing body of research is changing the very definition of maternal mental illness, showing that it is more common and varied than previously thought.\n\nScientists say new findings contradict the longstanding view that symptoms begin only within a few weeks after childbirth. In fact, depression often begins during pregnancy, researchers say, and can develop any time in the first year after a baby is born.\n\nRecent studies also show that the range of disorders women face is wider than previously thought. In the year after giving birth, studies suggest, at least one in eight and as many as one in five women develop symptoms of depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder or a combination. In addition, predicting who might develop these illnesses is difficult, scientists say. While studies are revealing clues as to who is most vulnerable, there are often cases that appear to come out of nowhere.\n\nAs public awareness has grown, often spiking after a mother kills herself or her baby, a dozen states, including Illinois, New Jersey, Texas and Virginia, have passed laws encouraging screening, education and treatment, and New York and others are considering action. The federal Affordable Care Act contains provisions to increase research, diagnosis and care for maternal mental illness.\n\nSometimes cases are mild, resolving themselves without treatment. But a large analysis of 30 studies estimated that about a fifth of women had an episode of depression in the year after giving birth, about half of them with serious symptoms.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nJeanne Marie Johnson, 35, of Portland, Ore., had a happy pregnancy, but she began having visions right after her daughter, Pearl, was born. She said in an interview that she imagined suffocating her while breast-feeding, throwing her in front of a bus, or \u201cslamming her against a wall.\u201d\n\nShe said she was horrified at the idea of hurting her baby, and did not carry out the acts she envisioned. Yet while overlooking a shopping mall skating rink, \u201cI pictured myself leaning over the bridge and letting her fall and bust like a watermelon,\u201d she said. \u201cI was actively thinking of ways to harm her.\u201d\n\nMost women experiencing such \u201cintrusive thoughts,\u201d as experts call them, never hurt their children. Some take extreme measures to protect their babies. One woman \u201cscooched downstairs on her butt for months because she\u2019d imagined throwing her baby downstairs,\u201d said Wendy N. Davis, the executive director of Postpartum Support International.\n\nSlide Show\n\nBut studies indicate that maternal stress may undermine women\u2019s ability to bond with or care for their children, and that children\u2019s emotional and cognitive health may suffer as a result.\n\nA complex interplay of genes, stress and hormones causes maternal mental illness, scientists say. \u201cHormones go up more than a hundredfold,\u201d said Dr. Margaret Spinelli, the director of the Women\u2019s Program in Columbia University\u2019s psychiatry department. After birth, hormones plummet, a roller coaster that can \u201cdisrupt brain chemistry,\u201d she said.\n\nSome women are genetically predisposed to react intensely to hormone changes. And some are more sensitive to stresses like difficulties with family, finances, childbirth or parenting.\n\nMaternal mental illness is not new. It was recognized as early as the fifth century B.C., when Hippocrates proposed that fluid from the uterus could flow to the head after childbirth and cause delirium. In the Middle Ages, mothers with such symptoms were viewed as witches or victims of witchcraft. In the 1920s, one Freudian-inspired theory attributed these mood disorders to frigidity, suppressed homosexuality or incestuous urges.\n\nScientific understanding has come a long way and continues to evolve. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, the established reference for psychiatric illnesses, first described these symptoms in 1994 as \u201cmajor depressive disorder\u201d beginning within four weeks of childbirth. The latest manual, published last year, said symptoms often include \u201csevere anxiety and even panic attacks,\u201d and estimated that half of what is considered major postpartum depression actually begins during pregnancy.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nDepression in pregnancy can be missed because symptoms like trouble sleeping and moodiness also occur in pregnant women who are not depressed. And doctors have historically been taught in medical school that \u201cwomen don\u2019t get depressed during pregnancy because they are happy,\u201d said Dr. Katherine L. Wisner, a professor of psychiatry and obstetrics at Northwestern University.\n\nIn a 2013 study, the largest screening of women for postpartum depression to date, Dr. Wisner and colleagues found that 14 percent of 10,000 women had depression four to six weeks after birth, but that for a third of them it actually started during pregnancy.\n\nOther research indicated that symptoms could emerge any time in the first year.\n\nAnother 2013 study assessed 461 women at two weeks and six months postpartum, and it found each time that 11 percent had obsessive-compulsive symptoms, about four times the rate for the general population of women. But it was \u201cnot the same 11 percent,\u201d said an author, Dr. Dana Gossett, the chief of gynecology and obstetrics at Northwestern. \u201cHalf got better by six months and another half developed O.C.D.\u201d\n\nResearch also shows that women can have several psychiatric disorders at once. In Dr. Wisner\u2019s study, two-thirds of the women with depression also exhibited anxiety; nearly a quarter had bipolar disorder.\n\nin their own words\n\nTina Duepner, 34, of DeSoto, Mo., had symptoms ranging from racing thoughts to suicidal feelings. She said she heard God\u2019s voice from a television, and other voices warning that her son, Landon, would be stolen from her.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "feature", "ptime": 20140615233606, "twitter": {"description": "Studies are revealing a more complex view of maternal mental illness, including that what is known as postpartum depression often begins during pregnancy.", "title": "New Findings on Timing and Range of Maternal Mental Illness", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/16/health/thinking-of-ways-to-harm-her.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000002773162"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/06/16/us/20140616-slide-8J7Y/20140616-slide-8J7Y-thumbLarge-v3.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/16/health/thinking-of-ways-to-harm-her.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000002773162", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/16/health/thinking-of-ways-to-harm-her.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "health", "channels": "NytNow", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/health/index.jsonp", "video": {"playerId": 2640832222001, "publisherReadToken": "cE97ArV7TzqBzkmeRVVhJ8O6GWME2iG_bRvjBTlNb4o.", "publisherId": 1749339200, "noShareToolsPlayerId": 3692909326001}, "DISPLAYDATE": "June 15, 2014", "edt": "NewYork", "ttl": "Mother's Mind (Series)", "keywords": "Pregnancy and Childbirth,Mental Health and Disorders,Depression (Mental),Therapy and Rehabilitation,Women and Girls,Parenting,Series,Anxiety and Stress,Mother's Mind (Series)", "description": "Studies are revealing a more complex view of maternal mental illness, including that what is known as postpartum depression often begins during pregnancy.", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Pam Belluck", "thumbnail_150": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/06/16/us/20140616-slide-8J7Y/20140616-slide-8J7Y-thumbLarge-v3.jpg", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "slug": "16mothers", "byl": "By PAM BELLUCK", "thumbnail_150_height": 150, "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "Studies are revealing a more complex view of maternal mental illness, including that what is known as postpartum depression often begins during pregnancy.", "tom": "News", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/06/16/us/20140616-slide-8J7Y/20140616-slide-8J7Y-thumbStandard-v3.jpg", "news_keywords": "Parenting", "CG": "health", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "June 15, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "News", "article": {"author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/b/pam_belluck/index.html", "section_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/pages/health/index.html", "section": "Health", "modified": "2014-06-27", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/health/index.jsonp", "tag": "Mother's Mind (Series)", "published": "2014-06-15", "section-taxonomy-id": "7D6BE1AF-8CD8-430B-8B2A-17CD0EAA99AC"}, "thumbnail_height": 75, "thumbnail_150_width": 150, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20140627115251, "hdl_p": "\u2018Thinking of Ways to Harm Her\u2019", "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/16/health/thinking-of-ways-to-harm-her.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/06/16/us/20140616-slide-8J7Y/20140616-slide-8J7Y-videoSixteenByNine1050-v3.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Studies are revealing a more complex view of maternal mental illness, including that what is known as postpartum depression often begins during pregnancy.", "title": "New Findings on Timing and Range of Maternal Mental Illness"}, "pdate": 20140615, "des": "Anxiety and Stress", "articleid": 100000002773162, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "New Findings on Timing and Range of Maternal Mental Illness", "col": "Mother's Mind: First of Two Articles", "PST": "News"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8ddb\"", "article_summary": "The federal Affordable Care Act contains provisions to increase research, diagnosis and care for maternal mental illness.\nA complex interplay of genes, stress and hormones causes maternal mental illness, scientists say.\nA fast-growing body of research is changing the very definition of maternal mental illness, showing that it is more common and varied than previously thought.\nScientists say new findings contradict the longstanding view that symptoms begin only within a few weeks after childbirth.\nRecent studies also show that the range of disorders women face is wider than previously thought."}
