(WIVB) \u2014 Residents in Western New York are again the target of phony IRS calls.\n\nThe Erie County Sheriff\u2019s office is warning residents that these calls are a scam. The Sheriff\u2019s office received numerous calls Saturday morning reporting callers claiming to be agents, officers or officials of the IRS. These callers can be very persuasive, even threatening to those who are skeptical.\n\nA real call from the IRS will never be threatening, according to IRS Commissioner John Koskinen.\n\n\u201cThe scammers, the way they are threatening people, is not the way we do business,\u201d Koskinen said. \u201cWe will never ask people to make a payment, and demand it on the phone. Even if you expect to hear from us, that is not the way we do it.\u201d\n\nThe first time the IRS contacts those with back taxes or issues is always by a letter, Koskinen said. So if a letter hasn\u2019t been received \u2014 he said the calls are almost guaranteed to be fake.\n\nCalls like this circulate the area frequently. New York State has set up a website for residents to report impersonation scams, tax evasion schemes and identity theft. That website can be found by clicking this link.\n\nNYS site to report fraud, scams, and identity theft\n\nThe Better Business Bureau has also set up a scam tracker website where you can search and report scams in your area. That website can be found by clicking here.\n\nBBB Scam Tracker\n\nCommon scams people are encouraged to report include the following:\n\nPosing as a treasury or other state officials, notifying people they have a large sum of money to collect, but need to submit a payment of $250 to collect it.\n\nAffordable Care Act penalty threats from tax preparers, who advise their clients to pay penalties directly to them, then pocket the funds.\n\nThreatening IRS phone calls to tax preparers, demanding client information.\n\nIRS phone scam from consumers, threatening arrest or penalties if a sum isn\u2019t paid immediately.\n\nPhishing emails are abound, too. New York warns it will never ask for personal information by email.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The simplest and best method of dealing with these calls is to ignore them.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=488276218", "og": {"site_name": "wivb.com", "description": "The simplest and best method of dealing with these calls is to ignore them.", "title": "WNYers targeted by fake IRS calls", "url": "http://wivb.com/2016/02/06/wnyers-targeted-by-fake-irs-calls/", "image": {"width": 660, "identifier": "https://lintvwivb.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/phone.jpg?w=1200", "height": 371}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The simplest and best method of dealing with these calls is to ignore them.", "creator": "@news4buffalo", "image": {"src": "https://lintvwivb.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/phone.jpg?w=640"}, "title": "WNYers targeted by fake IRS calls", "site": "news4buffalo", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "Buffalo News, Buffalo Weather | WIVB-TV News 4 Buffalo, NY | WIVB.com", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.linmedia.newstouch.wivb", "fb": {"pages": 83900655504}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://wivb.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/f7d9afd22abc1421f3f3acc9bc34faf7?s=16", "application-name": "wivb.com", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/news4buffalo", "published_time": "2016-02-06T18:15:34+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-06T23:36:29+00:00"}, "msvalidate.01": "25404283363C09DE121A55A903F03873", "google-site-verification": "rCC8KvhYhxYynxDuL7C_fyWPtSiu1m13vV8Xe8bufDg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "BUFFALO, N.Y.
