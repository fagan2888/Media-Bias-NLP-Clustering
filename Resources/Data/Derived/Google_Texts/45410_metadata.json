Lou Barletta, R-Pa., and Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va. Barletta introduced his bill after both he and the fire council sent letters seeking clarification from the IRS and received no response, said Tim Murtaugh, the congressman\u2019s spokesman.\n\n\u201cThe Internal Revenue Service could clear all this up in a moment by saying no, volunteer firefighters are not considered employees,\u201d Murtaugh said. \u201cThat\u2019s all it would take.\u201d\n\nThe IRS did not respond to a call and email from the Capital Press seeking comment. A Treasury Department spokesman told London\u2019s Daily Mail the agency is taking concerns about volunteer firefighters \u201cinto account as we work toward issuing final regulations on the employer-responsibility provision\u201d of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nIf volunteers are counted as employees in the final rule, many fire departments could be forced to curtail their emergency response activities or close entirely, asserted the International Association of Fire Chiefs.\n\n\u201cI think if it came to it, you could see agencies stopping at 49\u201d to avoid triggering the law, Finger said. \u201cLimiting volunteer hours is another thing, or eliminating benefit programs.\u201d\n\nIn Northern California\u2019s Shasta County, more than two dozen fire departments protect a vast rural expanse that includes valuable timberland and rangeland. The county\u2019s roughly 200 volunteer firefighters don\u2019t reach the 30-hour-a-week threshold, but how federal agencies treat volunteers is significant because many of the county\u2019s departments use them, principal administrative analyst Julie Hope said.\n\nWith 10 employees and 17 volunteers, the Shasta Lake Fire Protection District is too small to fall under the provisions of the law. But that doesn\u2019t stop chief Adrian Rogers from worrying.\n\n\u201cIt always worries me, especially if they don\u2019t see anybody as a volunteer,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is just one more thing. With all the other federal requirements, it\u2019s one more thing on the pile to get rid of volunteer firefighters in this nation. It\u2019s hard to get volunteers now as it is with all the training required.\u201d\n\nOnline\n\nNational Volunteer Fire Council: http://www.nvfc.org\n\nInternational Association of Fire Chiefs: http://www.iafc.org\n\nH.R. 3685: https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/113/hr3685", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Capital Press", "description": "REDDING, Calif. \u2014 The volunteer fire companies that protect farms and ranches in many areas in the West could suddenly face skyrocketing expenses under the new health care law unless Congress or the federal government exempts them, firefighters\u2019 groups say.Because of mileage, per diem", "title": "Obamacare could squeeze volunteer fire companies", "url": "http://www.capitalpress.com/article/20131216/ARTICLE/131219918/state", "image": "http://EOR-CPwebvarnish.newscyclecloud.com/storyimage/CP/20131216/ARTICLE/131219918/AR/0/AR-131219918.jpg&MaxW=600", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/capitalpress"}, "description": "Read Obamacare could squeeze volunteer fire companies from Capital Press", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fccec3\"", "article_summary": "The Internal Revenue Service counts volunteer firefighters as employees, meaning they're subject to employer mandates under Obamacare.\nWith all the other federal requirements, it\u2019s one more thing on the pile to get rid of volunteer firefighters in this nation.\n\u201cThe Internal Revenue Service could clear all this up in a moment by saying no, volunteer firefighters are not considered employees,\u201d Murtaugh said.\nA Treasury Department spokesman told London\u2019s Daily Mail the agency is taking concerns about volunteer firefighters \u201cinto account as we work toward issuing final regulations on the employer-responsibility provision\u201d of the Affordable Care Act.\n\u201cThat\u2019s another thing about this issue \u2013 volunteer firefighters have full-time jobs outside of the fire service, and a lot of those jobs provide health insurance,\u201d Finger said."}
