Sanders has been calling for more debates than were previously negotiated, and Team Clinton has responded that they\u2019d consider it if Sanders toned down the negativity.\n\nThere are a few problems here for Sanders, and Democrats.\n\n1. Donald Trump is going to be a disaster for this country, and for many of the issues that progressives care about. Donald Trump is pro-life, against renewable energy, pro-gun, against regulating greenhouse gases, for repealing Obamacare, against immigration, and against marriage equality. And that\u2019s just for starters.\n\nNo one should be suggesting that anyone vote for Trump rather than the Democratic nominee.\n\n2. Sanders has been fortunate in that Clinton has not played the \u201csocialist\u201d card against him during the primary. (As for Sanders being a \u201cdemocratic socialist and not a \u2018real\u2019 socialist, that point is debatable \u2014 and in any case, the nuance will likely be lost on an American public that tends to abhor anything with the \u201csocialist\u201d label.) The Republican nominee will be much less reticent, as Trump already routinely refers to Sanders as a \u201ccommunist.\u201d\n\nLest anyone claim that the terms socialist and communist no longer carry the sting they once did in American politics, I think that\u2019s wrong. Americans still associate socialism with the Soviet Union, and many Americans still have concerns that many longtime American socialists have, in the past, been too sympathetic to left-wing (often communist) dictators. And there\u2019s also concern that American socialists aren\u2019t \u201cAmerican enough,\u201d that they\u2019re too willing (and happy) to criticize the US.\n\nYou can disagree about whether it\u2019s fair for people to conclude this. But I think they will, and it\u2019s something a political campaign should be concerned about.\n\nAnd that\u2019s where Sarandon comes in. Calls for a Leninist revolution are not the talking points I\u2019d be embracing, were I representing someone who thought it was unfair to tie me to the Soviet Union.\n\nAnd mind you, this isn\u2019t the first time that a key Sanders supporter crossed the line with the revolutionary rhetoric. Just a few weeks ago, Sanders\u2019 top pollster, Ben Tulchin, was interviewed by the New Yorker. In that interview, Tulchin questioned the merits of capitalism:\n\nSanders has long embraced the socialist label, and it seems not to hurt him among younger voters. Ben Tulchin, Sanders\u2019s pollster, told me that millennials support Sanders \u201cbecause their generation is so f*cked, for lack of a better word, unless they see dramatic change. What\u2019s their experience been with capitalism? They have had two recessions, one really bad one. They have a mountain of student-loan debt. They\u2019ve got really high health-care costs, and their job prospects are mediocre at best. So that\u2019s capitalism for you.\u201d Tulchin, who is forty-two, joined the Sanders campaign for the same reason that many disaffected Democratic voters joined: the candidate\u2019s populist message, which he wasn\u2019t hearing from the President. \u201cObama is the guy who hangs out on the North Side of Chicago with wealthy people and he raises money from them,\u201d Tulchin said. \u201cNot to denigrate him, but, I mean, if you\u2019re from the kind of moderate business wing of the Party\u2014which he isn\u2019t exclusively, but he is partly\u2014you don\u2019t speak that language.\u201d\n\nNow, again, the issue isn\u2019t whether Tulchin is right (and I don\u2019t think he is). The issue is whether a top Sanders campaign official is feeding this negative meme about Sanders being a real, scary socialist \u2014 the kind many of us grew up with in the 50s, 60s and 70s.\n\nMillennial Sanders supporters might wish for a revolution. And maybe even some older voters are on board with that as well. But the majority of American\u2019s won\u2019t sign off on any revolution inspired by Vladimir Lenin. Team Sanders needs to get some message control, and they need to tamp down on the extremist talk. Susan Sarandon is a prime example of how Bernie Sanders is now turning voters away from the eventual Democratic nominee \u2014 and worse, towards Donald Trump.\n\nAmerica, progressives, and the people we care about, deserve better.\n\nFollow me on Twitter: @aravosis \u2014 Win a pony!
