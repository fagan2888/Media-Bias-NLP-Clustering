This despite the centrality of faith in conflicts abroad and controversies at home.\n\nClick Image to Enlarge Archive of the Sun\n\nMr. Trump vowed to protect Christians being targeted by the Islamist Jihad overseas. He spoke of his own religious faith. But our country is hurtling toward a constitutional showdown over religious liberty right here in America.\n\nThat\u0092ll come in the next month or so, when the Catholic charity known as Little Sisters of the Poor makes at the Supreme Court a gutsy gamble for protection from the birth-control mandate the Obama administration has promulgated under ObamaCare.\n\nGuess who filed the first friend-of-the-court brief on their side.\n\nYes, it was Orthodox Jewish rabbis.\n\nThey know that this case isn\u0092t about simply whether a group of nuns has to fill out paperwork to avoid being forced to pay for birthcontrol for their employees. You can bet the Ten Commandments on it.\n\nThis is about whether our increasingly socialistic system is going to stop where the First Amendment says it\u0092s supposed to stop. It\u0092s about the right of religious Americans to stand apart.\n\nAnd it\u0092s about George Washington\u0092s promise to the Jews.\n\nWashington made that promise in a famous letter to the Touro Synagogue in Rhode Island. One of the reasons it\u0092s so important is that he wrote it in 1790, more than a year before the First Amendment was ratified.\n\nOur first president was replying to a welcome sent to him by local Jews when he visited the Ocean State. Echoing Micah 4:4 in the Hebrew Bible, Washington prayed that \u0093every one shall sit in safety under his own vine and fig tree and there shall be none to make him afraid.\u0094\n\nOne way I like to put Washington\u0092s promise is this: In America, the fact that you fear God shall be no cause to fear your government. Yet today, millions of Americans who do fear God are starting to fear their government.\n\nSome are worried that the government will try to regulate \u0097 or even ban \u0097 circumcision. Some are wondering whether they have to host same-sex marriages if they rent out their home for traditional marriages.\n\nOthers fear they\u0092ll be maneuvered into paying for abortions. Or that possessing eagle feathers, sacred to Apaches, will expose them to charges under laws designed to protect endangered species. (That\u0092s an actual case.)\n\nLike the Little Sisters, the rabbis aren\u0092t looking out for only themselves. They argue that the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, under which the Little Sisters seek shelter, \u0093protects all religious exercise, no matter how obscure.\u0094\n\nThe rabbis are warning that the lower court \u0093refused to protect the Little Sisters\u0092 religious liberty\u0094 because the judges \u0093found their explanations regarding the nature and significance of their religious beliefs \u0091unconvincing.\u0092\u0094\n\nSince when do any of us have to convince a judge of our religious beliefs?\n\nNor are the rabbis alone. One brief siding with the Sisters is on behalf of the Church of the Lukumi Babalu, the Society for Krishna Consciousness, the Islamic Center in Murfreesboro and a pastor and other members of the Lipan Apache Tribe.\n\nThey all sense that our country is hurtling toward a moment of truth over how seriously it takes the whole idea of religious freedom. They fear we could come unmoored from the founding promises. I keep coming back to Washington.\n\nIn addition to Rhode Island, he wrote a separate letter to Jewish communities in Philadelphia, Charleston, Richmond, and New York. He boasted of the \u0093liberality of sentiment towards each other\u0094 held by \u0093every political and religious denomination of men in this country.\u0094\n\nThe foremost Founder called such sentiments a \u0093treasure beyond the reach of calculation.\u0094 He remarked that the \u0093power and goodness of the Almighty were strongly manifested\u0094 in America\u0092s \u0093glorious revolution.\u0094\n\n\u0093In war he directed the sword,\u0094 Washington wrote, \u0093and in peace he has ruled in our councils.\u0094\n\nThat\u0092s into what Trump tapped. The other GOP candidates get it, too. Let us trust that the Almighty has His eye on our own Supreme Court.\n\nThis column first appeared in the New York Post.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Little Sisters\u0092 Gutsy Gamble Touches on an Issue That Trumps All Politics", "og": {"url": "http://www.nysun.com/editorials/little-sisters-gutsy-gamble-touches-on-an-issue/89424/"}, "description": "One of the reasons Donald Trump\u0092s speech at Liberty University electrified evangelical voters is, I suspect, that we haven\u0092t heard on the campaign trail a great deal about religious freedom.
