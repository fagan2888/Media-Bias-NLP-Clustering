You know, he doesn\u2019t get enough negative credit for what he did with NAFTA. NAFTA is a disaster, OK. NAFTA has destroyed big, big sections of our country. If you look at New England, if you look at upstate New York, if you look at Pennsylvania, you look at Maryland and Connecticut , it\u2019s destroyed these places.\n\nIt was a moment of clarity in a torrent of free association that passes for a Trump speech, one in which he alludes to China\u2019s economic impact before dropping it for tales of his negotiating prowess with \u201cCHI-nuh,\u201d then on to Mexico (\u201cWe will build the wall\u201d), Hillary Clinton, Elizabeth Warren and whatever else crawls across his internal teleprompter.\n\nTrump knows what he\u2019s doing, though. His rhetoric is simple, dramatic, and repetitive.\n\nSaying NAFTA destroyed the economy flips the Clintonian strength of the booming 90s economy into a legacy of weakness. It\u2019s a message that\u2019s easy to remember and repeat. NAFTA is also a clue that Trump intends to make the election a referendum on the Clintons\u2019 dodgy past. Trump\u2019s best chance to overcome his stratospheric negatives is to drag the Clintons into the slime\u2014and there is ample fodder even before he fabricates accusations. He claimed the next day, \u201cHillary Clinton wants to abolish the Second Amendment.\u201d\n\nIn Eugene, Trump stuck to fact, if embellished, about Bill Clinton\u2019s personal history with women. Referring to Bill\u2019s past accusers of sexual assault, he accused Hillary Clinton of being \u201can unbelievably, nasty, mean enabler and what she did to a lot of those women is disgraceful.\u201d The charges could stick\u2014even the New York Times admits they could hurt Clinton\u2019s standing among female voters.\n\nMore significant, amid the junkyard of catch phrases, demagoguery and bloviating, Trump brings up issues neither party\u2019s establishment will touch\u2013the downsides of corporate globalization.\n\nHe told the crowd, \u201cWe have people that are great people \u2026 that haven\u2019t had a wage increase in 18 years. They\u2019re making effectively less money today than they made 18 and 20 years ago.\u201d Two days later he called for an increase in the minimum wage, disavowing his earlier opposition, and said that after he gets companies to bring jobs back to the United States, \u201cthe real minimum wage\u201d is going to be \u201ca lot more than the $15 even.\u201d He added that the wealthy would pay higher taxes (apparently all part of his master plan that begins with his proposal to slash the top tax rate by more than 35 percent).\n\nThat he is now more effectively picking up the torch of Bernie Sanders over low wages and inequality in America than Clinton (who is associated more with a demand for a $12 minimum wage, though she has said she supported some $15 proposals) is a warning of how savvy and unpredictable he is. It\u2019s also showboating, but that is intrinsic to his appeal.\n\nTo understand if he can turn his phenomenal success in the primaries into victory in November, I talked to more than 30 people at the rally, including 18 Trump supporters. Many explicitly stated they showed up to the rally because Trump is \u201cmaking this fun,\u201d \u201che\u2019s entertaining,\u201d \u201chistory is going down.\u201d\n\nMike, 56, a retired Sacramento County Sheriff\u2019s Deputy who now lives in Oregon, said, \u201cWe are excited. Trump is unlike anything I\u2019ve ever seen in my life.\u201d He wanted to see Trump \u201cshake things up\u201d and was \u201ctired of paying everyone else\u2019s bills.\u201d Mike said he supports restrictions on immigration, was \u201ctired of the U.S. policing the world\u201d and wanted \u201cAmerica to stop being taken advantage of like China does.\u201d\n\nBen, 56, a maintenance worker at a fruit processing plant, hit similar notes. \u201cI just want to be part of this. I want to see a change in the status quo and am tired of catering to all the countries in the world.\u201d He grumbled about \u201cworking to support other people\u2019s way of life,\u201d liked \u201cthe idea of sealing the Southern border\u201d and wanted to \u201cbring back jobs, instead of losing jobs to others.\u201d Ben was also attracted to Trump\u2019s personality, \u201cI like the idea he is not P.C. When he says something, I can understand him.\u201d\n\nMariah, in her fifties, came with two other women. For her, \u201cImmigration is the biggest thing\u2014[immigrants] not coming to this country and sucking us dry.\u201d Jessica said, \u201cBring jobs back,\u201d while Janice, who worked in a wood mill and prospected for gold, wanted someone who would \u201cstand up for the working class\u201d and not allow the federal government \u201ctake away our lands.\u201d\n\nMichael, 34, who works as a courier for a delivery service, said, \u201cYou can\u2019t just walk over the border and suck off the system\u2014you get food stamps, health care.\u201d His father, Paul, 60, said, \u201cI\u2019m not happy with the last eight years,\u201d and wanted Trump to get rid of Obamacare. Michael said, \u201cObamacare is bankrupting state after state after state.\u201d Paul added, \u201cWe need a businessman.\u201d\n\nPaul, 42, a unionized carpenter, came with his son, a college student. Paul said he\u2019s been \u201claid off more than I\u2019ve worked the last three years.\u201d He liked Trump because he\u2019s \u201cfor the little people\u201d and \u201cnot paid off by lobbyists.\u201d Paul said, \u201cIt\u2019s time to take America back, bring our jobs back.\u201d He said three friends who\u2019ve never voted before are big Trump fans \u201cbecause he\u2019s stirring up the pot, making things interesting.\u201d\n\nSteve, 52, who like a handful of others at the rally said they backed Cruz before joining the \u201cTrump train,\u201d said with a hint of disbelief. \u201cWe never thought we\u2019d be voting for a reality TV star.\u201d He hoped Trump \u201cas an outsider, whose pockets were not full of lobbyists, maybe could shake things up.\u201d To him, the Bushes and Clintons were all part of the status quo, but he also wondered, if Trump did get into office, \u201cMaybe we\u2019ll wind up with eggs on our faces.\u201d\n\nRichard, 70, retired from the U.S. Air Force, said, \u201cI love Donald. He speaks the way I speak.\u201d He said of the Republicans in Congress, \u201cWe\u2019re tired of broken promises. We voted for those guys who said they\u2019d stop Obamacare, and they didn\u2019t. They are part of the club, and he\u2019s not part of the club.\u201d When asked what he wanted to see Trump tackle first as president, he said, \u201cTear up the Iran contract, secure the border, get rid of NAFTA and stop companies from going overseas.\n\nMillennials cited similar reasons. Nick, 24, a metal fabricator for windmills (who wore a t-shirt reading, \u201cHillary Sucks But Not Like Monica,\u201d with pictures of Clinton and Monica Lewinsky), said, \u201cTrump speaks his mind. He\u2019s not paid for by everyone else.\u201d Connor, 23, a computer specialist for the Eugene Police Department, said he likes Trump \u201cbecause he\u2019s a businessman. He doesn\u2019t feed you bullshit. I hope he\u2019ll build the job economy back up and I hope he\u2019ll put up the wall, just for the illegals. I hope he\u2019ll squash the debt that\u2019s in the trillions.\u201d Rick, 29, said he\u2019s not worried about a job because he\u2019s finishing a electrical engineering degree, agreed with Trump\u2019s policies, such as \u201cbeing against abortion\u201d and building the wall \u201cbecause illegal immigrants are driving down wages for lower-class workers.\u201d\n\n(Gupta)\n\nWhat does this all indicate? Foremost, Trump is a classic authoritarian populist whose followers identify directly with him and a burn-down-the-house approach to politics. Many called him Donald or \u201cThe Donald.\u201d Cindy, 58, a veteran, said, \u201cWe trust him because of his personal success. He has the confidence, therefore we have the confidence.\u201d She added that Trump beat all the Republican opposition by \u201cthe sheer power of his personality.\u201d The will-to-power aura about Trump is one reason his campaign has a whiff of fascism.\n\nTrump is smitten with himself, spending much of his hour-long speech touting his electoral or business success. But he lets his followers bask in the narcissism.\n\n\u201cWe have a movement going on like has never been seen in this country. \u2026 I am nothing more than a messenger. I\u2019m a good messenger. Am I doing a good job as your messenger?\u201d The crowd responded with cheers.\n\n\u201cYou go look at the cover of Time magazine. I\u2019m on the cover so much, and it\u2019s not me, it\u2019s what\u2019s happening,\u201d Trump stated. That is all his supporters need to know. That nearly every factual point his supporters asserted was blatantly false is irrelevant: He will bring jobs back, he is a self-made man, undocumented immigrants come here for welfare, Obamacare is bankrupting states, the federal debt is a time bomb, the U.S. military is weak, we cater to the rest of the world. They are anxious and Trump strokes their fears. Then he said, \u201cWe used to win\u2014we don't win anymore.\u201d Now he\u2019s winning, which means his supporters are winners, and that will make America a winner again.\n\nYet Trump would not have gotten so far without feeding off the economic and social anxiety many Americans feel. His supporters regularly mentioned class, saying Trump is for workers, the average person, the working class. Not one person at the rally described a vocation as managerial or professional. It matches with data showing relative to the rest of Republican voters , Trump supporters earn less and are less likely to have college degrees.\n\nIt is notable that Americans are speaking the language of class across the political spectrum, but right-wing populism frames class through a racist lens. When his supporters say \u201cTake America back,\u201d the Tea Party movement slogan, it\u2019s code for white America. So is \u201cMake America Great Again,\u201d a revival of a time when whites were so dominant it was the natural order of things. Of the few people of color I talked to at the rally, all but one were vehemently opposed to Trump.\n\nTrump is successful because he\u2019s not selling a new idea. He is flashy new packaging on the 19th century ideology of producerism , which holds that a producing class in the middle is plagued by parasites above and below. Producerism is the glue for the Tea Party movement, painting Obama as a foreign subversive appeasing \u201cMuslim extremists,\u201d welfare recipients, and \u201cillegals\u201d at the expense of tax-paying Americans.\n\nMitt Romney invoked producerism in 2012 with his coded racial comment portraying 47 percent of Americans as Obama supporters who were \u201ctakers\u201d from the rest who were tax-paying \u201cmakers.\u201d Historically, producerism has targeted Black people, immigrants and Jews. But reducing Trump to white identity politics or tribalism, as Nate Silver does , utterly misreads what is happening. All of Trump\u2019s supporters see their grievances as economic: about jobs, wages, taxes, social services and debt. The subtext is racial, but like American history itself, class and race are inseparable.\n\nTrump also uses a gendered appeal that builds on a trend within the GOP. His rally wasn\u2019t just white to a face; it skewed older and appeared to be approximately two-to-one male. He complained that he can\u2019t say \u201cstrong men\u201d anymore without being criticized in the media. But he still unleashes a barrage of masculine dualisms: losers and winners, smart and stupid, great and horrible, strong and weak. His allusions to weakness in trade policy, in diplomacy, in military power are code for the emasculation of the United States. It helped attract armies of pissed-off white men who propelled him to the top of the Republican heap. He will deploy it double-barreled against Hillary Clinton, calling her weak on policy and weak in her personal life.\n\n(Gupta)\n\nWhen it came time to apportion blame for wage stagnation, Trump said, \u201cWe\u2019re angry at the stupidity and the incompetence of our leaders in this country because other countries are running away with our country, with our jobs, with our money. And it\u2019s like taking candy from a baby. And that\u2019s the way we are, and we\u2019re going to change, and we\u2019re going to change rapidly.\u201d It\u2019s stab-in-the-back language that borrows from anti-Semitic tropes.\n\nFor the Right, Clinton embodies elitist treachery, which Trump plays up. \u201cOur trade deficit with China increased nearly 40 percent during the Clinton tenure as secretary of state,\u201d he said at the rally. \u201cShe gave away our country, now she wants to run for president. She will be a total disaster, believe me.\u201d\n\nWhile Trump has paths to victory in the fall, they are narrow ones. He has to tear Clinton down while widening his base. But that will be difficult. Selling angry old white men a blow-up-the-system message was good enough to capture the Republican nomination, but that branding alone won\u2019t get Trump much further against Clinton especially with the GOP embroiled in a civil war . Republicans keep losing ground in the demographic match-up for the presidency\u2014among women, among youth, among minorities.\n\nNonetheless, Trump has openings against Clinton. His showmanship is bringing in new voters and Republican turnout is up 64 percent over 2012. Clinton is a villain out of central casting for Trump\u2019s America-First message, with her Wall Street lucre, backing of free-trade deals, and Clinton Foundation\u2019s cozy relations with global elites. By running to her left on economic and foreign policy, he clearly hopes to peel away Bernie supporters. Paul, the carpenter at the Eugene rally, said he also supported Sanders.\n\nNear the end of his speech, Trump said, \u201cWe want to be unpredictable, folks,\u201d speaking of U.S. military policy in the Middle East. He could have been talking about his stranger-than-fiction campaign and the next six months to come.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://inthesetimes.com/article/19119/donald-trump-hillary-clinton-eugene-oregon-speech", "image": "http://inthesetimes.com/images/made/images/Gupta_Trump_Eugene_500_349_s.jpg", "description": "With the Republican competition eliminated, Donald Trump's questionable rhetoric now has Hillary Clinton in its sights.", "title": "This Is What a Shift in Donald Trump\u2019s Rhetoric Looks Like"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "With the Republican competition eliminated, Donald Trump\u2019s questionable rhetoric now has Hillary Clinton in its sights.\nHe will deploy it double-barreled against Hillary Clinton, calling her weak on policy and weak in her personal life.\nMany called him Donald or \u201cThe Donald.\u201d Cindy, 58, a veteran, said, \u201cWe trust him because of his personal success.\nIt matches with data showing relative to the rest of Republican voters , Trump supporters earn less and are less likely to have college degrees.\nHe claimed the next day, \u201cHillary Clinton wants to abolish the Second Amendment.\u201dIn Eugene, Trump stuck to fact, if embellished, about Bill Clinton\u2019s personal history with women."}
