Even Rush Limbaugh is saying it's time for the GOP to do away with those impeachment hopes for President Obama.

There has been talk among Republicans as of late to have the President impeached for delaying his health care law and the country's immigration policies. Last Wednesday, Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Calif.) said that Obama should be removed for his "unconstitutional approaches" to the Affordable Care Act as well as immigration reform.

"There isn't going to be any impeachment because there isn't any political will," Limbaugh said. "You're never going to succeed."

Limbaugh said the Obama administration is "destroying the health care system" and "screwing up everything," but even still, there is very little possibility for impeachment.

"That would require Obama's approval numbers in the 20's," he added. "And even then, I'm not so sure that the people of this country would ever support removing the first black president."

So while Republicans can dream, Limbaugh said it's time to think of another solution.

"It's never going to happen!"
