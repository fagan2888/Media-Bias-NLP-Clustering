An alcoholic. A drug addict. A devastated young mother whose six-year-old son had recently drowned in a swimming pool accident.

These are the vulnerable women who alleged that comedian Bill Cosby sexually preyed on them over a span of five decades. The Washington Post reports new details of their experiences this morning, amid a firestorm of controversy surrounding the comedian’s alleged behavior. At this point, 16 women have accused Cosby of sexually assaulting them; 12 say he drugged them before forcing himself upon them, while another woman says that Cosby unsuccessfully attempted to drug her. As the Post reports:

The allegations are strung together by perceptible patterns that appear and reappear with remarkable consistency: mostly young, white women without family nearby; drugs offered as palliatives; resistance and pursuit; accusers worrying that no one would believe them; lifelong trauma. There is also a pattern of intense response by Cosby’s team of attorneys and publicists, who have used the media and the courts to attack the credibility of his accusers.

Indeed, it was the fear of near-certain demonization and disbelief that prevented many accusers from coming forward.

“Who was going to believe me?” writer Joan Tarshis, who says Cosby forced oral sex on her in the 1960s, said. “If he was a regular joe, I might have done something.”

Former Playboy Playmate Victoria Valentino — the accuser whose six-year-old son drowned in a swimming pool — voiced similar fears.

“What kind of credibility did I have?” she said. “In those days, it was always the rape victim who wound up being victimized. You didn’t want to go to the police. That’s the last thing you wanted to do back then.”
