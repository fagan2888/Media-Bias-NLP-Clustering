And we called for justice here.\n\nWe have spent the time since investigating the prison system and engaging Alabamians deeply in discussion of possible solutions.\n\nAfter an initial wave of denial, officials such as Gov. Robert Bentley and Corrections Commissioner Kim Thomas eventually admitted to deep problems, to not only a need for change, but the inevitability of it.\n\nYet it's come too slow.\n\nSo we end this year much as we began it: Calling for decisive action on the behalf of every decent Alabamian everywhere. This time, though, we are heartened by the many voices who amplify that call. We've listened to reformers who have labored tirelessly here for decades, and heard from thousands of everyday citizens of all political persuasions who have begun to understand the enormity of the crisis that confronts us.\n\nReform must start with an admission that the approach of the past two decades simply has not worked.\n\nThe prison system needs new leadership, from someone not steeped in its longstanding culture. It needs someone who won't tolerate what our investigations have uncovered: shuffling and even promotion of staff with records of misconduct.\n\nThree years is enough with Kim Thomas at the helm. It's time for him to step down or be replaced.\n\nBut that is not enough.\n\nWe said in January that Tutwiler -- where more than half the staff has engaged in sexual misconduct with inmates while working on the taxpayer dime -- should be closed.\n\nThe prison administration is so resistant that we are not even permitted inside to witness purported improvements. And there has not been a single new prosecution for law-breaking by staff. We say it again. The place is rotten, and at nearly 75 years old, well past its useful life. Its toxic past simply can't be rehabilitated.\n\nThen what is the answer?\n\nAlabama will need new prison capacity to alleviate its problems -- people can deny it, but there's no way to avoid it -- so let's start with a replacement for Tutwiler. While Alabama's general population has grown by 23 percent since 1977, the prison population has seen an exponentially higher rise -- more than 840 percent.\n\nChanges since 2009 have successfully slowed both felony convictions and new prison sentences, but our state facilities remain stubbornly packed, in part because one in three prisoners eligible for parole doesn't get it. The pardons and parole system, too, is under-staffed and hamstrung by rules that work against progress.\n\nAmid this depressing reality, there were encouraging signs in 2014.\n\nHigh among them was the extent of engagement on these issues among many Alabamians. There are still too many hoping, against all realism, that things can just go on, but at our public forums and through online conversations people shared personal stories and deliberated difficult options. They've told us, again and again, that Alabama's prison system isn't rehabilitating anyone, and that it is time for change.\n\nThe state has launched its own Justice Reinvestment initiative, and there is substantial study of best practices that are working in other places.\n\nAmong the reforms Alabama's new prisons leadership should embrace -- with full support and encouragement from the governor and legislature -- are:\n\nWider use of house arrest, weekend imprisonment, electronic monitoring and other community-based alternatives, which cost less than imprisonment and have been proven to keep intact the kinds of support systems that offenders will need when they emerge from punishment.\n\nMore spending in areas of both probation and parole, so that appropriate supervision follows those released from prison, and a better scoring system for identifying people in the system who might successfully take advantage of early release.\n\nA new strategy for sanctioning violators -- so-called \"swift and sure\" punishments that may involve a weekend in jail but cut back on the lengthy, court-involved probation revocation process that lands people back in prison. A new approach to drug crime, because imprisoning so many addicts is not working.\n\nEfforts to equip inmates with job skills, and an end to the stupid practice of making it almost impossible for ex-cons to get a driver's license so that they can get to work.\n\nIncentives for employers of released prisoners (it is at least ironic that the state hires out prisoners but does little to help them find work once released).\n\nNew classification of some felony offenses so that the three-strikes law that has contributed to much of the growth in the prison population is triggered less often for less-serious crime.\n\nWhen the state legislature convenes in March, there should be an omnibus bill ready to enact reforms. The approach, rightly, would be all or nothing. There is too much at stake to allow legislators to cherrypick pieces of the plan so they can look like they're doing something while the larger problems go on.\n\nNow comes the hard part. Alabama will simply have to spend more money on prisons. It can't build its way out of the problem -- the capacity needed is not affordable -- but the extreme over-crowding demands some immediate relief. Tutwiler isn't the only prison that's just too old to be effective, and county-level jails across Alabama face similar problems, so the population can't simply be off-loaded.\n\nA near-term increase in prison spending -- Alabama per prisoner cost ranks in the bottom five among American states -- is needed to effect longterm reductions.\n\nThroughout the year have come warnings that if Alabama doesn't act, the federal courts will intervene. They could order mass prisoner release, as was done in California.\n\nThey could order more costly changes than Alabama needs. Cynics -- and some of them are well-connected in political circles -- have suggested our legislators would prefer this, so they can blame the federal government for whatever happens.\n\nThey could even ignore court orders and create a standoff, daring federal courts to find them in contempt, jingoistically re-fighting the Civil War as cover for not doing their jobs.\n\nIt falls to all of us to tell our legislators clearly that this road cannot be taken. Alabama can and must take care of its own house. We do not need or want federal intervention. These challenges fall to our elected state leaders when they convene in Montgomery.\n\nWe ask them to listen to the decent people of the state of Alabama, who ask for moral leadership, who expect reform.\n\nFor far too long, taxpayers have been paying for state-sanctioned cruelty. It is time now for redemption.\n\nWe are strong enough to clean this shameful stain.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "alabama prisons, let people speak, unjust justice, opinion", "title": "Our view: Action is required and prison reform must start with new leadership for Alabama's prisons", "og": {"site_name": "AL.com", "description": "It falls to all of us to tell our legislators that Alabama can and must take care of its own house.
