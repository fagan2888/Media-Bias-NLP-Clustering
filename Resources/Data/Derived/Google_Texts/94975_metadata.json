(She did polling for the late Rocky Mountain News.)\n\nWeigel reports Republicans give the band a 32% favorable/15% unfavorable rating, close to that among independents (26% favorable, 9% unfavorable), and Democrats (31% favorable/6% unfavorable).\n\n\u201cWith that level of positive regard, don\u2019t be surprised if you hear \u2018Truckin\u2019\u201d coming from a GOP candidate\u2019s campaign bus at their next stop in Iowa or New Hampshire,\u201d she wrote about the poll\u2019s findings.\n\nThe poll was conducted in June with the Mellman Group measuring the band\u2019s image among all Americans after the Grateful Dead announced its its \u201cFare Thee Well\u201d tour after 50 years. The band\u2019s final three shows are this weekend in Chicago.\n\nAmong the findings:\n\nFour in five Americans (79%) have heard of the Grateful Dead, and two-in-five (39%) know them well enough to have formed an impression of them. The band is better known among the GOP (46% than among Democrats (37%) or independents (35%). Overall, 29% of Americans have a positive impression of the Dead and 10% an unfavorable one.\n\nWeigel highlighted the lyrics from the song \u201cThrowing Stones:\u201d \u201cSo the kids, they dance, they shake their bones / And the politicians throwing stones\u2026\u201d", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Fare Thee Well,Grateful Dead,Lori Weigel,Mellman Group,Public Opinion Strategies", "language": "en, sv", "og": {"site_name": "The Spot", "description": "The iconic band Grateful Dead is best known among Republicans, but after 50 years in the business it sparks no partisan divide.", "title": "Grateful Dead sparks no partisan divide, poll shows", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/thespot/2015/07/04/grateful-dead-poll-public-opinion-strategies/121729/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/thespot/files/2015/07/GratefulHistoric-495x365.jpg", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "The iconic band Grateful Dead is best known among Republicans, but after 50 years in the business it sparks no partisan divide.", "title": "Grateful Dead: no partisan divide", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/thespot/2015/07/04/grateful-dead-poll-public-opinion-strategies/121729/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/thespot/files/2015/07/GratefulHistoric-495x365.jpg", "creator": "@lynn_bartels", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "The iconic band Grateful Dead is best known among Republicans, but after 50 years in the business it sparks no partisan divide."}, "article_summary": "Weigel highlighted the lyrics from the song \u201cThrowing Stones:\u201d \u201cSo the kids, they dance, they shake their bones / And the politicians throwing stones\u2026\u201d\nWhat do you get when you cross the Grateful Dead with the firm Public Opinion Strategies?\nAmong the findings:Four in five Americans (79%) have heard of the Grateful Dead, and two-in-five (39%) know them well enough to have formed an impression of them.\nThe poll was conducted in June with the Mellman Group measuring the band\u2019s image among all Americans after the Grateful Dead announced its its \u201cFare Thee Well\u201d tour after 50 years.\nOverall, 29% of Americans have a positive impression of the Dead and 10% an unfavorable one."}
