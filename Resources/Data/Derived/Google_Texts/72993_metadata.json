(He also recalled the time he tried to stab a guy.) The conservative neurosurgeon has a long history of drawing analogies to history\u2019s greatest atrocities.\n\nIn his short political career, Carson has developed two favorite targets for historical hyperbole: American slavery and the Holocaust. Below is a list of issues (the ones we could find) that Carson believes warrant the comparison.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act\n\nIn 2013, not long after he first became known as a national political figure, Carson told the audience at the Christian Values Voters Summit that Obamacare was the worst thing to happen to America since slavery. He went on to assert that the law is slavery, in a way, \u201cbecause it is making all of us subservient to the government, and it was never about health care. It was about control.\u201d\n\nGun control\n\nAfter the mass shooting this month at Umpqua Community College in Oregon, Carson said that the Holocaust \u201cwould have been greatly diminished if the people had been armed.\u201d Carson made similar claims in his 2014 book \u201cOne Nation,\u201d saying, \u201cOne can only wonder what would\u2019ve happened if people had not tolerated the foolishness of Adolf Hitler\u2019s appeal to the baser instincts of greed and envy and his institution of an official weapons confiscation program.\u201d\n\nPolitical correctness\n\nIn 2014, discussing what he called the \u201cPC police,\u201d Carson told Breitbart News that we live in a \u201cGestapo age.\u201d He continued the analogy: \u201cI mean, very much like Nazi Germany\u2014and I know you\u2019re not supposed to say Nazi Germany, but I don\u2019t care about political correctness\u2014you know, you had a government using its tools to intimidate the population. We now live in a society where people are afraid to say what they actually believe.\u201d\n\nThe Obama administration\n\nThis may be Carson\u2019s most common Nazi analogy. As far back as 2009, he has suggested time and again that the country is on the brink of becoming Nazi Germany. Over the years, he\u2019s made the comparison more direct, suggesting in 2014 that people should read \u201cMein Kampf\u201d to understand the Obama administration.\n\nThe progressive movement\n\nIn 2014, during a campaign event for Oregon GOP Senate candidate Monica Wehby, Carson told the crowd that the progressive movement was trying to \u201cfundamentally change who we are.\u201d \u201cThere comes a time when people with values simply have to stand up. Think about Nazi Germany,\u201d he said. \u201cMost of those people did not believe in what Hitler was doing. But did they speak up? Did they stand up for what they believe in? They did not, and you saw what happened.\u201d\n\nAbortion\n\nCarson\u2019s comment on \u201cMeet the Press\u201d was not the first time he had invoked slavery to talk about abortion. At an anti-Planned Parenthood rally in July, Carson drew a connection between the procedure and the slave trade, saying, \u201cWe have just gradually slid in terms of our morals to a point where we don\u2019t really care about the killing of human beings. That is the bad news. The good news is I think we are changing. \u2026 There was a time in this country where there were people who thought it was OK to own other people. \u2026 We fortunately as a society matured.\u201d\n\nBONUS: Marriage equality\n\nThough slavery and the Holocaust are clearly Carson\u2019s favorite historical analogies, he does occasionally dig elsewhere in the annals of history for his cautionary tales. In the case of marriage equality, Carson believes we should go as far back as the fall of Rome to understand what\u2019s at stake when two people of the same sex wed. In his 2012 book \u201cAmerica the Beautiful,\u201d Carson wrote, \u201cIf we can redefine marriage as between two men or two women or any other way based on social pressures as opposed to between a man and a woman, we will continue to redefine it in any way that we wish, which is a slippery slope with a disastrous ending, as witnessed in the dramatic fall of the Roman Empire.\u201d As Buzzfeed\u2019s Andrew Kaczynski has documented, Carson has been making similar comments since at least 1997.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://fusion.net/wp-content/themes/fusion-theme/assets/images/favicons/browserconfig.xml?v=1462067892199", "msapplication-TileColor": "#da532c", "description": "Carson made headlines when he likened abortion to slavery in an interview with NBC\u2019s Chuck Todd.
