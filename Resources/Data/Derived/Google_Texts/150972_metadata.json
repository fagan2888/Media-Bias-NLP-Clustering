(Source: GoFundMe page)\n\nA Tampa-area college student lies in a Cuban hospital bed, having been injured in a collision outside Havana, and her friends and family are desperately trying to scrape together the $50,000 they need to get her airlifted to Florida.\n\nBarbara \u201cBarbie\u201d Jimenez, 22, who was scheduled to graduate from the University of South Florida this year with a degree in philosophy, went to visit family members in Cuba early this month with her boyfriend, John Fox, 23.\n\nAccording to the Tampa Bay Times, the couple arrived in Cuba on Aug. 3 and was met by her aunt, Mar\u00eda Jimenez, and cousin Walter Jimenez.\n\nThe next day, the four of them piled into the 1952 Chevrolet taxi with the destination of San Jos\u00e9 de las Lajas, a town 30 minutes or so southeast of Havana, where the Jimenez family lives. They never made it.\n\nJust south of the city, in Arroyo Naranjo, a green Cuban Revolutionary Army truck slammed into the Chevy on the front driver\u2019s side, according to the Florida-based Cubanet news site, killing the cabbie and seriously injuring the four passengers.\n\nThe day after the accident, Barbara\u2019s sister Caridad arrived at the hospital and found her in a coma, having had \u201csevere head trauma\u201d and able to breathe only because she had received an emergency tracheotomy.\n\n\u201cJust seeing her laying there, a lifeless body in a coma,\u201d Caridad told the Times, \u201cIt was really bad.\u201d\n\nFox, an engineer working for Northrop Grumman in Melbourne, Florida, suffered a cerebral fracture, broken hip and had a stroke. Thanks to efforts by his employer and staff at the recently reopened U.S. embassy, Fox was transported to the Ryder Trauma Center at Jackson Memorial Hospital in Miami on Aug. 8 and is making \"extraordinary progress,\" his father, Jim Fox, told the newspaper.\n\n\"We thought he might have complete right-side paralysis, but he moved his arm and his leg. He lifted his arm and he scratched his face,\" he said.\n\nAlthough all four of the injured are no longer in critical condition, it seems that Jimenez wasn\u2019t as lucky as Fox.\n\nShe woke up from her coma five days later but at first wasn\u2019t able to breathe on her own, nor did she understand why she was in a hospital, Caridad told Fox13 in Tampa.\n\nNot having any health insurance, her family was told that it would cost them $50,000 to transport her to Florida, money her parents, Jorge Jimenez and Daisy Falcon, do not have.\n\n\"I wish we could take her back. This isn't easy,\" her dad told the Tampa Bay Times. \"I feel so frustrated. The truth is this is the hardest thing that has ever happened to me in my life.\"\n\nJust getting to Barbara\u2019s bedside was a bit of an ordeal for her parents. They had to fly to Washington, D.C., first to renew an expired passport and fix a problem with a residency card, according to a GoFundMe page set up by her sorority at USF.\n\nEmbassy personnel didn\u2019t reach out to the family right away, as they had with Fox, the page claims. \u201cThey did not make any contact with Barbara\u2019s family whilst in Cuba until a fortunate run-in with one of the Embassy\u2019s representatives,\u201d it reads.\n\nFor reasons that aren\u2019t immediately clear, Fox and the Cuban Jimenez family members were taken to a different Havana hospital than Barbara, according to the crowdfunding page.\n\nOver the weekend, Caridad told The Oracle, the USF student paper, that Barbara has improved immensely. She breathes freely now, and \u201cShe\u2019s able to talk clearly\u2026 When she regained her voice [it] was thin and very weak, and she really wasn\u2019t making sense.\u201d\n\nThe family still isn\u2019t sure what long-term effects from the accident she will have. She had been preparing to take the LSAT and hoped to go into politics after attending law school.\n\nThe GoFundMe page, titled \u201cBring Barbie Home,\u201d is hoping to collect $75,000 to cover Jimenez\u2019s transport to Florida as well as help the family with medical expenses. As of Tuesday afternoon, a little more than $13,600 had been pledged.\n\nLike us on Facebook\n\nFollow us on Twitter & Instagram", "article_metadata": {"classification": "LANGUAGES/English", "dcterms.modified": "2015-08-25 13:37:46 EDT", "dcterms.abstract": "A Tampa-area college student lies in a Cuban hospital bed, having been injured in a collision outside Havana, and her friends and family are desperately trying to scrape together the $50,000 they need to get her airlifted to Florida.", "twitter": {"image": "http://a57.foxnews.com/global.fncstatic.com/static/managed/img/fn-latino/news/0/0/South%20Florida%20girl%20in%20Cuba2.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "site": "@foxnewslatino", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@foxnewslatino"}, "dc.format": "text/html", "dc.publisher": "Fox News Latino", "parsely-metadata": "{\"title\":\"Uninsured Florida college student stranded in Cuba after horrific car crash\",\"link\":\"http://latino.foxnews.com/latino/news/2015/08/25/uninsured-florida-college-student-stranded-in-cuba-after-devastating-car-crash/\",\"image_url\":\"http://a57.foxnews.com/global.fncstatic.com/static/managed/img/fn-latino/news/0/0/South%20Florida%20girl%20in%20Cuba2.jpg?ve=1&tl=1\",\"type\":\"article\",\"identifier\":\"4d531c26ca56f410VgnVCM100000d7c1a8c0RCRD\",\"section\":\"news\",\"pub_date\":\"2015-08-25T17:37:46Z\",\"tags\":[\"LANGUAGES/English\"]}", "prism.aggregationType": "front", "keywords": "college student,Trauma Center,health insurance,head trauma,Havana,Northrop Grumman,University of South Florida,John Fox,Jim Fox,Melbourne Florida,lifeless body,broken hip,hospital bed", "prism.channel": "fnl", "dc.description": "A Tampa-area college student lies in a Cuban hospital bed, having been injured in a collision outside Havana, and her friends and family are desperately trying to scrape together the $50,000 they need to get her airlifted to Florida.", "dc.identifier": "urn:uuid:4d531c26ca56f410VgnVCM100000d7c1a8c0RCRD", "pagetype": "article", "dc.subject": "college student,Trauma Center,health insurance,head trauma,Havana,Northrop Grumman,University of South Florida,John Fox,Jim Fox,Melbourne Florida,lifeless body,broken hip,hospital bed", "description": "El gigante de Redmond podr\u00eda lanzar dos nuevos modelos de Xbox One que llegar\u00edan al mercado en los pr\u00f3ximos dos a\u00f1os, seg\u00fan reporta Kotaku.
