A three-vehicle accident left a red Honda driven by an 18-year-old Antelope woman overturned on eastbound Interstate 80 near the Taylor Road off ramp this afternoon.

The incident happened around 2:30 p.m. No drivers or passengers were transported to a hospital, as only minor injuries were reported. The wreck left two of the vehicles imobile.

“There was a silver SUV, there was a white pickup truck and there was a red Honda: The Honda was making a lane change and didn’t notice that there was already someone in the lane,” said California Highway Patrol Officer Robert Luthy “The vehicles made contact, the Honda swerved out of the way, and in the process, hit another vehicle and ended up overturning, but the injuries are very, very minor.”

No parties have been given tickets at this time. Luthy told the Press Tribune that fault and further details will be determined during an investigation.
