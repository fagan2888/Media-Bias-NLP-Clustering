â€” A man who authorities say caused Cary Town Hall to be locked down briefly faces charges after authorities say he brought a BB gun into the building Wednesday morning.

Khung Cil, 43, of 514 Wickham Place, Cary, was arrested shortly before 9:45 a.m. on a felony charge of assault with a deadly weapon upon a governmental officer and a misdemeanor charge of prohibition of carrying and display of handguns, firearms and other weapons at certain public locations.

Police received an alert around 9:35 a.m. from the town's finance department, at 316 N. Academy St., about a man who appeared to be carrying a long gun. He left calmly after speaking briefly to an employee.

But he refused to comply with officers and allegedly bumped one with his vehicle before fleeing the scene.

No one was injured and no shots were fired, and authorities did not say why the man might have had a weapon.
