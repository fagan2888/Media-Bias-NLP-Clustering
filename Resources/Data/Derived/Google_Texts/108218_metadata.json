Mike Lee seemed less politician and more political philosophy professor as he diagramed the underpinnings of his conservative reform agenda.\n\nWhile Lee predicted that Republicans will \u201cwin at least seven or eight\u201d new seats to gain a majority in the Senate, he underscored the importance of articulating an enduring conservative message.\n\n\u201cExposing the emptiness and ugliness of the progressive vision won\u2019t be enough to advance our cause,\u201d the Utah Republican told students. Instead, \u201cwe need to demonstrate in word and deed the virtues and the humanity of our vision.\u201d\n\n>>> Mike Lee to Take Over Conservative Senate Group\n\nAfter the event, The Daily Signal spoke with Lee about President Obama\u2019s handling of the Ebola virus that is plaguing three West African countries and alarming Americans in recent weeks.\n\nLee described Obama\u2019s presidency as \u201creckless,\u201d with the Ebola outbreak representing another example of a haphazard administration.\n\nOne issue that continues to plague both parties: Obama\u2019s unconfirmed nominee for surgeon general, Vivek Murthy. The Senate has not acted on the nominee since his selection on Nov. 14, 2013.\n\nLee described Obama\u2019s presidency as \u201creckless,\u201d with the Ebola outbreak representing another example of a haphazard administration.\n\nLiberals have placed blame on Republican \u201cobstructionism,\u201d but Lee said the delay is indicative of systemic Democrat irresponsibility. Pointing to numerous bills \u201cthat have passed the House of Representative but haven\u2019t seen the light of day,\u201d Lee argues that \u201cunder current Democrat leadership in the Senate, we\u2019ve had nothing but obstruction.\u201d\n\nLee expressed frustration that Republicans have shouldered responsibility for a delayed vote on the nomination \u201ceven though Democrats control the executive calendar.\u201d\n\nEven though Lee wouldn\u2019t say whether he would vote for Murthy\u2019s confirmation, he promised to \u201cconsider each nominee based on that nominee\u2019s own merits.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, as West Africa continues to grapple with Ebola, Lee criticized Obama for refusing to consider a travel ban on commercial flights to and from countries facing an outbreak.\n\n\u201cWe have the potential for a global health epidemic,\u201d Lee said. \u201cIf you initiated a travel ban, I can\u2019t help but think it could make a difference.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Sen.
