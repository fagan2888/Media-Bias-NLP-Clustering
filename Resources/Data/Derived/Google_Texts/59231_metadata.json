It proposes health savings accounts similar to those in Indiana\u2018s health insurance plan, and would make state insurance data and Medicare claims data public, to allow patients to comparison-shop on pricing.\n\nRokita argues the GOP version would force medical prices down through competition, while preserving existing doctor-patient relationships. Rokita says Republicans tried to offer many of these ideas in the original health care debate three years ago.\n\n\u201cWe were told that we would have to pass Obamacare to find out what was in it,\u201d Rokita said. \u201cAnd now as more and more people see what is in it vis-\u00e0-vis how it is affecting their daily lives, this was an opportune time not just to say no but to say what could be.\u201d\n\nRokita acknowledges the bill will go nowhere in the Senate without Democratic support. He says that would probably first require the existing law to prove unworkable as more provisions take effect \u2014 something he maintains as inevitable.\n\n\u201cWe reject the idea that government knows best, that government should be between you and your doctor,\u201d Rokita said. \u201cThat we should have special boards deciding what you need, that we know better than you what you need from your doctor and how best to get it.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Rokita, along with six other House Republicans drafted a bill that would serve as an alternative to Obamacare.", "generator": "WordPress 3.9.10", "og": {"site_name": "News - Indiana Public Media", "description": "Rokita, along with six other House Republicans drafted a bill that would serve as an alternative to Obamacare.", "title": "Congressman Todd Rokita Unveils Alternate Health Care Plan | News - Indiana Public Media", "url": "http://indianapublicmedia.org/news/congressman-todd-rokita-unveils-alternate-healthcare-plan-55973/", "image": "http://indianapublicmedia.org/news/files/2012/02/02-06-2012-HealthCare.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@wfiunews", "image": "http://indianapublicmedia.org/news/files/2012/02/02-06-2012-HealthCare.jpg", "description": "Rokita, along with six other House Republicans drafted a bill that would serve as an alternative to Obamacare.", "card": "summary", "title": "Congressman Todd Rokita Unveils Alternate Health Care Plan"}, "fb": {"app_id": 160118390716029}, "bitly-verification": "f9ab3b0a7f0c", "viewport": "width=device-width,user-scalable=yes,initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdcc4d\"", "article_summary": "Rokita says Republicans tried to offer many of these ideas in the original health care debate three years ago.\nSeven House Republicans have unveiled their own version of a federal health care law.\nIt proposes health savings accounts similar to those in Indiana\u2018s health insurance plan, and would make state insurance data and Medicare claims data public, to allow patients to comparison-shop on pricing.\nPhoto: Bill Shaw/Indiana Public Media News Rokita, along with six other House Republicans drafted a bill that would serve as an alternative to Obamacare.\nThe bill drafted by members of the Republican Study Committee, including Fourth District Representative Todd Rokita, repeals President Obama\u2018s health care law, and replaces it with a $7,500 income tax deduction if you buy your own insurance."}
