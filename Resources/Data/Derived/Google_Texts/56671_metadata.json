Ad Policy\n\nIn this e-mail discussion, which took place in January 2015, \u201cSubject to Debate\u201d columnist Katha Pollitt and former executive editor Betsy Reed, now editor in chief of the Intercept, reflect on the state of contemporary feminism, both in the nation and in The Nation.\n\nReed: In December 1992, sitting at my messy editorial assistant\u2019s desk in the offices of the glossy magazine where I worked at the time, I read your Nation essay, \u201cAre Women Morally Superior to Men?\u201d I didn\u2019t know you personally yet, but as a reader, I hung on your every word. And here were 6,000 of them, so bracing and brilliant that the moment of encountering that essay was seared into my memory with the sort of clarity that usually attends only the tragic or transformative occasions of life. Like a surgeon operating on soft tissue, you deftly dissected the arguments of so-called difference feminists until there wasn\u2019t much left of them. And I thought: good riddance. The Carol Gilligans and Deborah Tannens of the world were threatening to set us back, reinforcing stereotypes of \u201crelational\u201d women and \u201cautonomous\u201d men that have always been used to justify the exclusion of women from positions of power and authority, relegating us to a squishy and cuddly domestic sphere. At the time, I could think of no more dismal fate than that.\n\nMy thinking on these issues has changed a bit since then, and I wonder if yours has too. But leaving that aside for now, what made your essay so meaningful to me was that it was an unsparing critique of feminism that so clearly came from within feminism. To this day, the magazine walks a fine line between participating in movements and reporting on them\u2014and I do believe there are good reasons to maintain some journalistic distance from movements with which we sympathize. Still, reading back into the magazine\u2019s archives in the 1970s, it seems to me that The Nation was not a forum in which the feminist movement hashed out its most contentious debates, at least until you became a regular contributor. There would be a critique, or one view on an internal feminist controversy, but not multiple perspectives, as the magazine has had on other matters such as war or partisan politics. Would you agree with that characterization?", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "http://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/greece_women_ap_img-275x173.jpg", "sailthru.author": "Betsy Reed, Katha Pollitt", "description": "Straight talk about essentialism, sexism, leaning in and speaking out", "generator": "WooCommerce 2.3.13", "og": {"site_name": "The Nation", "description": "Straight talk about essentialism, sexism, leaning in and speaking out", "title": "Spreading Feminism Far and Wide", "url": "http://www.thenation.com/article/spreading-feminism-far-and-wide/", "image": {"width": 1440, "identifier": "http://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/greece_women_ap_img.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "height": 907}, "updated_time": "2015-06-29T06:06:25+00:00", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Straight talk about essentialism, sexism, leaning in and speaking out", "title": "Spreading Feminism Far and Wide", "url": "http://www.thenation.com/article/spreading-feminism-far-and-wide/", "image": {"height": 907, "src": "http://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/greece_women_ap_img.jpg", "identifier": "http://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/greece_women_ap_img-1440x756.jpg", "width": 1440}, "site": "@TheNation", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "March 23rd, 2015", "sailthru.title": "Spreading Feminism Far and Wide", "keywords": "feature, feminism, nation history, child care, domestic violence, gender equality, sexism", "fb": {"app_id": 192399944158735}, "sailthru.content_id": 117203, "sailthru.tags": "Feminism,Nation History,Feature", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheNationMagazine", "tag": "sexism", "published_time": "2015-03-23T11:01:02+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-29T06:06:25+00:00", "author": "http://www.thenation.com/author/smccroskey/"}, "sailthru.description": "Straight talk about essentialism, sexism, leaning in and speaking out.", "sailthru.image.full": "http://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/greece_women_ap_img-680x430.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca1a7\"", "article_summary": "But leaving that aside for now, what made your essay so meaningful to me was that it was an unsparing critique of feminism that so clearly came from within feminism.\nDownload a free PDF of the issue, with articles by James Baldwin, Barbara Ehrenreich, Toni Morrison, Howard Zinn and many more, here.\nMy thinking on these issues has changed a bit since then, and I wonder if yours has too.\nLike a surgeon operating on soft tissue, you deftly dissected the arguments of so-called difference feminists until there wasn\u2019t much left of them.\nThis article is part of The Nation\u2019s 150th Anniversary Special Issue."}
