Section 1557 prohibits discrimination in healthcare on the basis of a number of protected classes, including sex. The proposed regulations codify existing informal guidance from HHS interpreting this provision to include protections from discrimination on the basis of gender identity and sex stereotyping. HRC and its members applaud HHS for taking this important step towards ending health disparities facing the transgender community and increasing access to vital services and care.\n\nHowever, HRC and its members voiced concern that the rulemaking falls short of protecting all LGBT people from discrimination. As proposed, these provisions do not provide explicit protections from discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. The proposed rules\u2019 absence of these explicit protections not only ignores the health crisis facing lesbian, gay and bisexual people, but is inconsistent with broader policies within the Obama administration as described by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) and fails to reflect current legal doctrine concerning sexual orientation discrimination.\n\nHRC and its members also weighed in on the Department's invitation for comments regarding the inclusion of a religious exemption. HRC believes that no such exceptions should be added, either for sex discrimination or any other ground covered by Section 1557. Nothing in the text of the ACA authorizes an addition of a religious exemption \u2013 and adding such exemptions have the potential to cause great harm to members of the vulnerable populations that Section 1557 is intended to protect, including LGBT people.\n\nHRC and its members are committed to working with HHS to improve the health of LGBT people across the country and we urge HHS to take the necessary steps to ensure that the vision and promise of the ACA and Section 1557 is realized for all people including the LGBT community.
