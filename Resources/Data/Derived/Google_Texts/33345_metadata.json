She\u2019s not afraid to bear all her biases in a naked display of cheerleading under the guise of dispassionate political scrutiny.\n\nThe conclusion of a segment rehashing the conventional wisdom floating around the Beltway \u2013 that Obama\u2019s determination to flagrantly ignore the will of the voters expressed at the polls in 2014 is actually a display of gallant defiance \u2013 begins as poorly as it ends.\n\nFrom reforming the health care system to ending the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, Wolf Blitzer noted that the president has largely accomplished what he set out to do in office.\n\nDare we examine the results of these supposed successes?\n\n\u201cFor starters, meeting self-declared enrollment expectations for a program that is both coerced and subsidized is probably a lot less impressive as a policy achievement than the DC media might imagine,\u201d wrote The Federalist\u2019s David Harsanyi in a piece dismantling this emerging D.C. press corps narrative. \u201cAs for voters, it\u2019s just as plausible that those who oppose Obamacare \u2013 still a majority of Americans \u2013 look at the solidifying of bad policy as a negative development rather than a win.\u201d\n\nJust over the Afghan border in Pakistan, the resurgent Taliban recently slaughtered over one hundred children. American and NATO-allied nations will not make the mistake they made in Iraq and will be leaving a residual force behind when combat troops are fully withdrawn. The odds that these troops will see fighting soon as a revived Taliban seeks to reverse the outcome of the 2001 Afghan war in the wake of withdrawal are extraordinarily high.\n\nAs for Iraq, withdrawal was short-lived. Not only is America and its allies reengaged in Iraq militarily, with boots on the ground and all, that is only the result of Obama\u2019s dithering over how to respond to the Syrian Civil War. As an outcome of his indecision, America is again engaged in Iraq and also in an entirely new theater of combat operations: Syria.\n\nThat\u2019s quite the success story.\n\nBorger then went on to take a look at the political impact of the president\u2019s decision to unilaterally pursue the normalization of diplomatic relations with Cuba. She and Blitzer both conceded that there may be some risk in this course of action. Of course, there is the potential to alienate Republicans who will dominate both chambers of Congress for the remainder of the Obama presidency. Borger determined, however, that Republicans could be in an even worse position because so many of them favor the gradual and legislated reversal of over 50 years of American foreign policy.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s actually also, in his own way, setting the table for the 2016 election causing Republicans in many ways to box themselves in on many issues, such as Cuba, which a lot of people believe is a demographic issue more than anything else,\u201d CNN Chief Political Analyst Gloria Borger said.\n\nIt\u2019s true that the Cuban vote, once a reliably Republican bloc, has shifted toward Obama. In 2012, Obama won among Florida\u2019s Cuban voters under the age of 45 by 26 points. He lost Cuban voters who are fully aware of how Fidel Castro has decimated Cuba, e.g. those over 45-years-old, by 29 points. In Borger\u2019s defense, there are some indications that the Cuban vote is leaning Democratic as opposed to merely shifting their support toward Obama. Former Democratic gubernatorial nominee Charlie Crist won among Cuban voters by 50 to 64 percent.\n\nBut a handful data points do not a trend make. Borger might have easily observed that, without Obama on the ballot in 2016, the Cuban vote in Florida could easily shift again; particularly given this dramatic change in America\u2019s policy toward Cuba. While the younger generation of Cuban-Americans is generally predisposed to favor the embargo\u2019s repeal, the older generation favors it intensely. They will not be dying off before the next election, and the ingredients are present for a rather significant intensity gap.\n\nBorger put a cherry on top of her analysis when she insisted that this freshly energetic Obama, who has steadfastly ignored the voters that stand athwart his presidency yelling stop, reminds her of Superman himself.\n\n\u201cI think he\u2019s kind of like Clark Kent stepping into the phone booth and coming out with the cape, and saying, \u2018Now I\u2019m going to do what I\u2019ve always wanted to do,\u2019 and he\u2019s doing it,\u201d she said.\n\nThat might not be how you would interpret a president\u2019s hostile indifference to the public mandate, but you\u2019re no Chief Political Analyst.\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "Sounds right.", "title": "CNN\u2019s Gloria Borger: Obama is basically Superman", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2014/12/18/cnns-gloria-borger-obama-is-basically-superman/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary", "creator": "@JazzShaw"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "keywords": "Barack Obama, CNN, Cuba, gloria borger, Wolf Blitzer,", "article": {"published_time": "2014-12-18T23:01:46+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-12-18T20:08:38+00:00"}, "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fddb4d\"", "article_summary": "CNN\u2019s Gloria Borger: Obama is basically Supermanposted at 6:01 pm on December 18, 2014 by Noah RothmanYou have to hand it to CNN\u2019s Chief Political Analyst Gloria Borger.\nIn 2012, Obama won among Florida\u2019s Cuban voters under the age of 45 by 26 points.\nIn Borger\u2019s defense, there are some indications that the Cuban vote is leaning Democratic as opposed to merely shifting their support toward Obama.\nIt\u2019s true that the Cuban vote, once a reliably Republican bloc, has shifted toward Obama.\nFormer Democratic gubernatorial nominee Charlie Crist won among Cuban voters by 50 to 64 percent."}
