It\u2019s also five days until the Department of Homeland Security runs out of money and goes dark, violating Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell\u2019s pledge to avoid funding shutdowns on the GOP\u2019s watch; Democrats have blocked Republicans\u2019 fourth attempt to link DHS funding to a full repeal of President Barack Obama\u2019s executive action on immigration. And seven days from now, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu opens the latest chapter in his rocky relationship with Obama with a high-stakes speech before Congress, and things have gotten even weirder (see below). Here\u2019s your Three-Minute Briefing, all the News You Can Use in 180 seconds or your next one\u2019s free:\n\nBibi, Call Your Office...: Now that the Netanyahu speech to Congress has become a thing, a recent Gallup public-opinion poll shows that fewer than half of self-identified Democrats approve of his government\u2019s dealings with the Palestinians \u2013 and that\u2019s an improvement. On the flip side, Republicans are still rock-ribbed allies of Israel, with more than 80 percent of them giving Tel Aviv the thumb\u2019s up, compared with about 60 percent of the general public.\n\n...And Make an Appointment with Sen. Durbin...: The poll results apparently haven\u2019t reached Democratic honchos on Capitol Hill. Though the party has split over whether to attend or boycott the speech, some Dems are going to give Netanyahu some face time when he gets to Washington, even though it sends a mixed message to their base.\n\n...To Discuss the Fierce Urgency of \u2013 Wait, What?: And though Netanyahu is expected to declare Iran\u2019s pursuit of a nuclear weapon the worst thing for Israel in the history of forever, his own intelligence service is a little less certain. Al Jazeera reports that leaked documents from 2012 \u2013 the same year Netanyahu did this at the United Nations \u2013 show Mossad didn\u2019t think Iran was all that close to getting the bomb, and probably wouldn\u2019t be any time soon.\n\n[READ: Iran Nuclear Talks 'Productive' as Deadline Looms]\n\nBlock That BIll: The House is set to send the Keystone XL pipeline bill is scheduled to hit Obama\u2019s desk on Tuesday, and all reports are the president has inked up his veto pen, ready to swat the bill back to the cheap seats. But he\u2019d better keep it full: Though it\u2019s only the third veto of his presidency \u2013 mostly because he had a good blocker when Sen. Harry Reid was the majority leader \u2013 The Washington Post reports the GOP will probably send more of him his way before it\u2019s all said and done.\n\n\u201cWe Can\u2019t Quit You, Eric!\u201d: The mutual loathing between Attorney General Eric Holder and Republicans in Congress should have ended by now: It\u2019s been five months since Holder said he\u2019d step down, and nearly a month since the Senate grilled Loretta Lynch, his successor. But the GOP isn\u2019t saying goodbye to the man they love to hate because of frustration over Obama\u2019s executive action on immigration, and because Democrats keep blocking a bill tying its repeal to Department of Homeland Security funding. So they\u2019ve put Lynch on ice, and kept Holder on the job, to vent its frustration.\n\nCritical Condition: For years \u2013 and at least 50 fruitless votes \u2013 Republicans insisted that they have a viable alternative to Obamacare, and all they\u2019d need is a chance to prove it. That chance has come, however: the GOP controls Congress, and the Supreme Court could take a machete to the Affordable Care Act in a few weeks. But Vox reports the GOP doesn\u2019t really have an exit strategy in place and that we should all be very afraid. And try not to get sick until the next election cycle.\n\nCurb Your Enthusiasm: Brought in to overhaul the troubled Department of Veterans\u2019 Affairs, Robert McDonald might have to revamp his image: The Huffington Post caught him lying about his military career. In a spontaneous interaction with a homeless veteran in Los Angeles, McDonald blurted out that hey, he was a member U.S. Special Forces, too! A harmless interaction, unless it was caught on tape. Which it was. McDonald has apologized, the White House is standing by him and no one in the famously protective Special Forces community wants him out, but it may take a day or two for the embarassment to subside.\n\nThat Sound, Governor? A Fat Lady Singing: The hits just keep coming for New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, a presumed Republican 2016 presidential candidate. A state judge has ruled Christie illegally shorted the state employees\u2019 pension budget by $1.57 billion last year and that he better find the money, pronto, along with the $2.9 billion he owes it in this year\u2019s budget. The ruling, following two months of really bad headlines and some ugly approval ratings from his home state, has crippled Christie\u2019s presidential ambitions, and the major GOP donors he\u2019s trying to court have pretty much moved on. Just like the rest of us.\n\nSchock and Gall: Speaking of bad looks, Congressional spokesmodel Aaron Schock, an Illinois Republican with the GQ look and baller lifestyle, may have some explaining to do, and pretty soon. The Associated Press looked into the congressman\u2019s finances and found he\u2019s been flying high, literally, on other people\u2019s dime \u2013 including using taxpayer funds and campaign donations for private jets, primo concert tickets and massages. Schock, identified as a big-time Republican fundraise and a rising GOP star, says he\u2019s done nothing wrong, but AP reports that the records say otherwise \u2013 which helps explain why he didn\u2019t want any reporters to see his \u201cDownton Abbey\u201d-inspired office. The Dowager would not be pleased.\n\n[READ: Aaron Schock Under Increased Scrutiny]\n\nWatching the Throne: Conventional wisdom says next year\u2019s Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia is going to be a coronation for Hillary Clinton on her way to the White House: She\u2019s dominated the presidential conversation on the left, and no credible challenger has emerged \u2013 so far. But the National Journal reports that the real experts think the situation is more complicated: Clinton\u2019s campaign-in-waiting has shown some design flaws, the Republicans have hidden strengths and the Dems might want to put the crown away and start worrying about the lack of a deeper presidential bench.\n\nYour Morning Video: Frank Underwolf is big and bad and full of hot air:\n\nStat of the Day: Percentage change since 1993 in the annual sales of vinyl records in the United States: +2,590 (courtesy Harper\u2019s Index).\n\n\n\nDuly Noted: In 1803, in its Marbury v. Madison decision, the Supreme Court established judicial review of the constitutionality of statutes. In 1864, the first Union prisoners arrived at the Confederates' Andersonville prison camp in Georgia. In 1868, the U.S. House of Representatives impeached President Andrew Johnson following his attempted dismissal of Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton; Johnson was later acquitted by the Senate. In 1988, in a ruling that expanded legal protections for parody and satire, the Supreme Court unanimously overturned a $150,000 award that the Rev.
