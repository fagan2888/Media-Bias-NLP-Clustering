David Axelrod labeled the president \u201cno-drama Obama\u201d during the 2008 campaign, and Valerie Jarrett infamously said that Barack Obama has been \u201cbored to death his whole life.\u201d And now, in an interview with CBS News, former defense secretary Robert Gates \u2014 arguably President Obama\u2019s most experienced Cabinet officer \u2014 tells us that he saw in the president an \u201cabsence of passion \u2026 absence of a conviction of the importance of success.\u201d\n\nA blas\u00e9, no-drama attitude, boredom, a lack of conviction and an absence of passion can all be seen as factors contributing to Obamacare\u2019s failure, a bewilderingly weak foreign policy, and a piecemeal, eleventh-hour approach to dealing with Congress on domestic issues, including the budget and our national debt. Obama is a bystander president who shrugs as events unfold and yawns as our problems get worse. As I have said in the past, I believe that for Obama, being president is all about having the job, not doing the job.\n\nPresident Obama, left, with then-Defense Secretary Robert Gates in 2009.

The problem is that the president is not one of those people. It is obvious that when he is not campaigning, Obama lacks purpose and energy. All we get from him are occasional speeches and perfunctory meetings that look and sound okay but are not connected to robust, spirited organizational efforts by the White House or other executive agencies.\n\nIt is said that the White House \u2013 and ultimately the entire presidency \u2013 reflects the personality of the president. Well, soon we will see if the Democratic Party will also start to reflect Obama\u2019s dispassionate approach. Can the Democratic Party maintain its energy and commitment when, according to some of Obama\u2019s closest advisers, the president doesn\u2019t have much of his own to contribute? Or will the attitude conveyed from the top sap the spirit from the Democrats? They can\u2019t count on a perceived dislike of Republicans in Congress to substitute for the lack of any excitement provided by Obama. Remember that in 2012, many in the GOP thought the prospect of defeating Obama would energize Republicans to turn out and vote, even if Mitt Romney could not. Well, Republicans were wrong. Will Democrats make the same mistake?\n\nAs Obama\u2019s second term drags on, we\u2019ll see if the indifference from the top, coupled with a string of failures \u2013 on foreign policy, Obamacare, a stagnant economy and other domestic issues \u2013 will weigh on the Democrats in 2014. It will be interesting to watch the final weeks of candidate recruitment and the critical upcoming fundraising season to see if there is an Obama malaise developing in the Democratic Party.\n\nFollow Ed on Twitter: @EdRogersDC", "article_metadata": {"description": "Barack Obama is a bystander president who shrugs as events unfold and yawns as our problems get worse.", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Barack Obama is a bystander president who shrugs as events unfold and yawns as our problems get worse.", "title": "The Insiders: The problem with \u2018no-drama Obama\u2019", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2014/01/13/the-insiders-the-problem-with-no-drama-obama/", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2013/12/30/Others/Images/2013-12-29/AP0902270106921388366535.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@EdRogersDC"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2014/01/13/the-insiders-the-problem-with-no-drama-obama/", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "the insiders, barack obama, white house, democrats, election 2014, robert gates,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "the insiders, barack obama, white house, democrats, election 2014, robert gates,"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0a9d\"", "article_summary": "President Obama, left, with then-Defense Secretary Robert Gates in 2009.\nAs I have said in the past, I believe that for Obama, being president is all about having the job, not doing the job.\nObama is a bystander president who shrugs as events unfold and yawns as our problems get worse.\nThey can\u2019t count on a perceived dislike of Republicans in Congress to substitute for the lack of any excitement provided by Obama.\nIt is obvious that when he is not campaigning, Obama lacks purpose and energy."}
