But for all practical purposes, it\u2019s already on.\n\nOne intriguing feature about the shadow primary this cycle is that it features three potential contenders for the \"moderate establishment candidate\" slot.\n\nToday in Michigan, for example, former Florida Governor Jeb Bush offered this hint-hint, nudge-nudge of a non-answer when asked about his plans for 2016: \"I have no idea whether I\u2019m going to run for office or not.\" Translation: I\u2019m totally thinking about running for office.\n\nNew Jersey Gov. Chris Christie is busy telling Republicans that they need to find a candidate with, as The New York Times describes it, \"broad appeal, like himself or Jeb Bush.\" Christie reportedly warned a meeting of social conservatives this summer that their alternative was to \"pick somebody else and lose.\"\n\nAnd then there\u2019s Mitt Romney. Like Bush and Christie, he hasn\u2019t officially said he\u2019s running. But people close to the former Massachusetts governor are saying that it\u2019s on his mind. And in a Des Moines Register survey last week, Romney was the only GOP candidate to beat Hillary Clinton\u2014who is also not technically running yet\u2014when likely voters in Iowa were asked who they would pick if the election were held today.\n\nObviously, early polls like this have no predictive value when it comes to the final outcome of the 2016 election. But they can weigh on a candidate\u2019s mind, and influence his or her decision to get into the race.\n\nThere are plenty more potential candidates in the mix\u2014Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, Sen. Marco Rubio. It\u2019s going to be a crowded field.\n\nBut right now, it\u2019s especially worth paying attention to Romney, Christie, and Bush, all of whom are vying for what is essentially the same \"slot\" in the Republican line-up\u2014the moderate establishment favorite who wins the nod on the strength of electability. Partly that's because their candidacies will help gauge the continuing strength and influence of the old-line party establishment. And partly it's because a fight over that slot could unsettle the outcome of the primary in unusual ways.\n\nThe conventional wisdom, which is not perfectly accurate but true enough, is that the Republican Party establishment usually picks a favorite early on, puts a lot of resources into this candidate, and that this person then typically wins the GOP nod after the other candidates duke it out and split the remainder of the vote. But it\u2019s at least imaginable that if three or even just two of this trio of establishment-friendly contenders enter the race, then donor resources, and primary votes, could end up split, making room for someone else\u2014perhaps someone a little more interesting\u2014to end up with the nomination.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "Technically, the 2016 Republican presidential primary hasn\u2019t started yet.
