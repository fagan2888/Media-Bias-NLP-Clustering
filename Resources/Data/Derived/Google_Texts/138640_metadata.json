The federal deadline to sign-up for health insurance is now well in the rear view mirror and you find yourself without health care. You don\u2019t receive insurance from your employer. You don\u2019t qualify for Medicaid, and you didn\u2019t sign up in the federal marketplace during the open-enrollment. The Affordable Care Act\u2019s individual mandate says that Americans have to obtain health insurance or pay a penalty. The Internal Revenue Service will be responsible for collecting individual mandate penalties.\n\n\u201cFor 2014, the penalty would either be the greater of one percent of your gross income or adjusted gross income over a certain threshold,\u201d says Jonathan Kassouf, a Certified Public Accountant in Birmingham. \u201cOr 95 dollars per family member, so that\u2019s 95 dollars per taxpayer, per spouse and for a child I think its 47 dollars and 50 cents.\u201d\n\n$95 for the husband, $95 for the wife and $47.50 for a child, and the lowest amount a family of three could be paying is $237.50. That\u2019s a decent amount of money to have to pay to not have insurance.\n\n\u201cIt may be cheaper than buying insurance on the exchange if you don\u2019t get a subsidy,\u201d says Leonard Nelson, professor emeritus at Samford University with a background in public health. \u201cThere are people who were self-employed, had individual insurance policies or family policies and their income is high enough that they don\u2019t get a premium subsidy, and their premiums increased.\u201d\n\nHe says some families he knows saw their premiums double over last year\u2019s amount. When your penalty for the year equals one month of insurance it may just be cheaper to pay the IRS at least for this year.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not too terribly significant in year, in 2014,\" says Kassouf. \u201cBut in 2015 the flat fee goes up considerably and then in 2016 the same thing occurs it goes up considerably again from 2015.\u201d\n\nThat means our same family of three from earlier would pay no less than $812 in 2015 and $1737 in 2016. And that\u2019s only if they earn less than the percentage of the gross annual income set by the government that particular year. This year it\u2019s one percent. So unless our family makes less than $33,900 according to Healthcare-dot.gov then they\u2019ll be paying more than the flat fee. So, many people may be paying more but how is the IRS going to get it? If you are receiving a return the penalty will be subtracted from that amount, but if you owe money the penalty will be tacked on. This is where it gets a little tricky.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t have any power to get that portion of what you owe them,\u201d says Montre Carradine, a law professor at the University of Alabama. \u201cThey can\u2019t do it through the normal procedures that they would utilize for typical penalties, so they can\u2019t garnish your wages, they can\u2019t issue tax liens on your property. So they don\u2019t have any way to get it other than to take money from you that they owe you.\u201d\n\nThat may seem like a lot of leeway in a law meant to get everyone insured by the end of this year. But Leonard Nelson isn\u2019t surprised.\n\n\u201cThe Obama Administration is not eager to enforce these mandates because that would be unpopular,\u201d says Nelson. \u201cIf you start fining employers or if you start fining individuals there is going to be significant political blowback.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s even if they can identify you as someone who does not have health insurance.\n\n\u201cTheir way of finding you is through you self-reporting on your tax return so you have to have made enough income to file your tax return,\u201d says Carradine. \u201cYou have to file a tax return in order for them to identify for you and then again they check it against what the health insurance companies provide for them.\u201d\n\nJonathan Kassouf says not being eligible to file a tax return is just one of the many exemptions that exist to avoid penalties from the IRS.\n\n\u201cDepending upon whether or not you\u2019re a member of a certain religious sect, whether or not you\u2019re a member of a health care sharing ministry, whether or not you\u2019re a U.S. citizen, whether or not you were imprisoned at least one day during a month, and Indian tribe\u2026\u201d\n\nWhile people may make a fuss over the individual mandate and its penalties-- it may not be the big burden everyone expects. At least for 2014\u2019s taxes.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Science & Health", "description": "All year long, Alabama Public Radio is collaborating with A-L-dot-com on the Affordable Care Act.
