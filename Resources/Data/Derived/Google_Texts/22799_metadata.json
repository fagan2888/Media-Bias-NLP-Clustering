And despite reporting a growing deficit, increasing payroll liabilities and penalties and interest related to those payroll issues, the audit said the nonprofit \"continues to borrow from and lend money to officers and employees.\"\n\nAlternatives Living has been the focus of a number of critical audits. A December 2013 report by the state auditor found that the organization owed nearly $940,000 in state and federal taxes dating to 2009. An audit performed by the New Orleans firm Duplantier, Hrapmann, Hogan and Maher in 2012 said that the nonprofit overstated expenses by more than $29,000. It also noted personal expenses charged to the company for travel, concert and sporting tickets, repairs to personal vehicles and college tuition.\n\nCheck back with NOLA.com | The Times-Picayune for more on this story", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "business, homelessness, homepage, new orleans, news", "title": "New Orleans nonprofit spent $130k on cars, concerts, sporting events, legislative auditor finds", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"New Orleans nonprofit spent $130k on cars, concerts, sporting events, legislative auditor finds\", \"link\": \"http://www.nola.com/politics/index.ssf/2015/05/new_orleans_nonprofit_spent_13.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://image.nola.com/home/nola-media/width620/img/politics/photo/screen-shot-2015-05-22-at-41008-pmpng-ae8d0deb20553c46.png\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"16089128\", \"pub_date\": \"2015-05-25T12:03:00Z\", \"author\": \"Richard A.
