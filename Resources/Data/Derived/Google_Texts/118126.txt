Diedra Garcia has resigned as president and CEO of the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce of Metro Denver.

Board of directors member Mike Ferrufino was named interim president and CEO on Wednesday. Ferrufino is vice president and general manager of KBNO Radio and had served as the board’s chairman.

“Although we are sad to see Diedra move on, we are excited to have someone of Mike’s caliber to take the reins of our organization,” said board chairman Diego Sedillo in a news release.

Garcia, the former president and CEO of DRG Construction in Denver, was named the chamber’s CEO in January 2014.

In a note to members announcing her resignation last week, Garcia noted that in the past year she refined the focus of the organization with a three-year plan developed around creating jobs and business opportunities for Latinos and supporting companies that do business in Latino markets.

During her tenure, she said, cash flow improved dramatically, total assets grew and financial liabilities were reduced.

“There is still so much opportunity to serve our members, and I have been honored and proud to play a role in that,” she wrote.

“I look forward to being a life-long supporter of the Hispanic Chamber and to watching the continued success of the organization and our community.”
