Did anybody see consumers rewarded with cheap money and cheap gasoline \u2013 along with a healthy economy \u2013 nicely wrapped under the 2014 economic Christmas tree?\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s a good lesson that it\u2019s one thing to predict economic trends \u2013 the high-probability business patterns we may see. It\u2019s another to suggest the rare-chance surprise!\n\n\n\nSo what largely unforeseen developments will dominate business chatter when the 2015 holiday season rolls around?\n\n\n\nWe asked some of the smartest business minds around town what economic surprises \u2013possibilities, not predictions \u2013 they could see emerging in 2015.\n\n\n\nHere are 15 surprises that might wow us next year.\n\n\n\n1. Fed holds still\n\n\n\nCould a weak economy force the Federal Reserve to keep interest rates low?\n\n\n\n\u201cAlthough everyone seems to be anticipating that the Fed will raise interest rates in 2015, I will buck that trend and predict the Fed will leave rates unchanged until at least 2016,\u201d says Craig Everett, a finance professor at Pepperdine University and director of the Private Capital Markets Project. \u201cWe do not expect robust demand for growth capital in 2015.\u201d\n\n\n\n2. New home prices boom\n\n\n\nCould continued cheap money give the housing recovery extra legs? \u201cWith rates staying low, a surprise would be a second big bounce in the housing markets,\u201d says economist Christopher Thornberg of Beacon Economics. He does \u201cexpect price appreciation to pick up next year significantly.\u201d Predicts Scott Laurie, CEO of Olson Homes from Seal Beach: \u201cContinued economic strength with unemployment headed below 5 percent with a corresponding increase to wages. This would support further growth in the housing.\u201d\n\n\n\n3. Loans go adjustable\n\n\n\nCould lenders and borrowers get more comfortable with adjustable-rate mortgages \u2013 funding 1-in-3 or more of 2015 purchases vs. 3 percent in 2009? \u201cAdjustables are part of a healthy market,\u201d says veteran market analyst John Karevoll from CoreLogic DataQuick. \u201cSub-categories of a healthy housing market are still dormant today and need to get active again. The \u2018gotta buy\u2019 crowd is doing OK. The discretionary mid- and move-up and move-down crowds are still waiting things out.\u201d\n\n\n\n4. More bosses flee California\n\n\n\nCould regulatory and tax burdens create a rush of employers moving out of the state? \u201cI am not seeing any positive movements in Sacramento to make California a more business-friendly state,\u201d says Michael Fleming, CEO of Farrell\u2019s Ice Cream Parlour restaurant chain from Lake Forest. \u201cI see more California regulations and a higher minimum wage in 2016.\u201d\n\n\n\n5. Water shortages get real\n\n\n\nCould water rationing be required and will the ensuing soaring cost hinder economic growth, much like the gas shortages in the \u201970s? \u201cThe average American home feels the impact on their water bill, which could go up as high as five times,\u201d says Orange County personal finance adviser Victoria Collins. \u201cNew residential construction in arid climates is all but halted. Food prices increase. The U.S. government is forced to make water a tradeable commodity.\u201d\n\n\n\n6. Cheap oil begets a bonus\n\n\n\nCould savings from cheap gasoline build momentum for a California economic boom? \u201cThe significant drop in the price of oil will have a very positive impact on economy in California since we are such a consumer-driven state,\u201d says Jim Proehl, managing director at commercial landlord PM Realty Group. \u201cGood for us, bad for Texas!\u201d\n\n\n\n7. Oil goes bust\n\n\n\nOr could cheap energy hammer the economy or lead to war? Don Ankeny, CEO of commercial landlord Westcore Properties, says: \u201cUnintended consequences of cheap oil ripple through U.S. economy, costing jobs and GDP growth \u2013 and the country slips into recession.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdds dealmaker Kevin Burke of Trinity Capital: \u201cWe will see a conflict in the Middle East, instigated by a bad actor such as Russia or Iran, to raise oil prices for their floundering economies.\u201d\n\n\n\n8. Real tax reform happens\n\n\n\nCould a Democratic president faced with a Republican Congress mold his legacy through a landmark political compromise that transforms the nation\u2019s tax code?\n\n\n\n\u201cWhy? It is needed and overdue,\u201d says Anil Puri, dean of Cal State Fullerton\u2019s business school. \u201cIt will be easier to do in the coming year than at any other time.\u201d\n\n\n\n9. New pairings materialize\n\n\n\nCould we see rare political unions that would benefit the nation \u2013 and the economy? Wayne Pinnell, managing partner of Haskell and White accountancy in Irvine, dreams of this kind of surprise: \u201cJeb Bush and Hilary Clinton decide to run on the same ticket (for president and vice president,)\u201d he says. \u201cAligning the country for the first time \u2013 ever?\u201d\n\n\n\n10. Bull market continues\n\n\n\nDespite all the worry about the stock market\u2019s six-year upswing ending, could 2015 be the year the rally reheats? Stock analyst Charles Rother of American Strategic Capital in Costa Mesa thinks 20 percent gains are possible. \u201cWe have all the necessary ingredients for a euphoric U.S. stock market,\u201d he says. \u201c\u2026 and investors with short memories. Let the party begin!\u201d\n\n\n\n11. The mall retools\n\n\n\nCould the public tire of online shopping, leading to a revival of in-store shopping \u2013 powered by those same Web-based merchants? \u201cAs people want a more humanized experience, the online giants begin taking over malls throughout America,\u201d says Tyler Resh, marketing director at First Foundation investment managers in Irvine. \u201cConverting them into distribution centers and using the storefronts to showcase goods and process returns.\u201d\n\n\n\n12. Facebook users take flight\n\n\n\nCould the many controversial actions by Facebook finally catch up with the online social media giant? \u201c2015 was the year they left the site in droves,\u201d suggests marketing consultant Rochelle Veturis Coles of Sister Act Media in Lake Forest. \u201cUsers did not outright delete their accounts \u2013 it\u2019s way too cumbersome. They no longer spent massive amounts of time there, nor did they show as much engagement or activity.\u201d\n\n\n\n13. Tourists reverse gears\n\n\n\nCould a strong U.S. dollar scare foreign visitors away as tourism costs soar? \u201cI think we will be talking about the huge drop in international visitors to the U.S. and in particular California,\u201d says tourism consultant Alan Reay of Atlas Hospitality in Irvine. \u201cThe increasing strength of the dollar combined with weakening economies worldwide, will have a dramatic effect on visitors coming to the U.S.\u201d\n\n\n\n14. Hoteliers make youth push\n\n\n\nCould hotels be badly misreading what youthful tourists want \u2013 better gyms, faster technology and fancier dining options? \u201cThe most audacious experiments will fall flat,\u201d says Chris Meyer, head of Expedia CruiseShipCenters in Laguna Hills. \u201cLike their elders, young travelers will choose tried and true value \u2013 free breakfast and Internet \u2013 over much ballyhooed \u2018lifestyle\u2019 features. Millennials, after all, are more interested in the destination experience than lodging ambiance.\u201d\n\n\n\n15. Commuters revolt\n\n\n\nWill gridlocked traffic jams push drivers to the edge \u2013 with massive protests? \u201cFrustrated O.C. commuters will occupy the eastbound 91 freeway for nine days much like the movement in Hong Kong,\u201d says Glenn Hayes, CEO of NeighborWorks Orange County. \u201cA radical group will stage a fast in the FasTrak lane.\u201d\n\n\n\nContact the writer: 949-777-6727 or jlansner@ocregister.com\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"geo.placename": "Santa Ana", "geo.region": "US-CA", "content_section": "business", "description": "Business: Lansner: Here are 15 economic surprises for 2015 | says, year, economic, cheap, california, economy, see, market, oil, business", "geo.position": "33.745573;-117.867834", "author": "JONATHAN LANSNER", "og": {"site_name": "The Orange County Register", "description": "Think back a year ago.
