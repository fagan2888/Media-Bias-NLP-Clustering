According to professor Robert Lanza, the answer to this question may be the key to understanding life, death, and existence itself. In his new book, the Wake Forest University professor submits that death, space, and even time are mere illusions that obscure the irreducible fact of eternal life.\n\nIf such an argument sounds arcane, that\u2019s because it is: much of Lanza\u2019s work takes place in a realm where objects aren\u2019t just small, but where the very acts of measuring and observation begin to unravel. We\u2019re talking, of course, about the quantum realm \u2014 the subatomic microworld where everything we think we know about the universe is abruptly turned on its head. Here, particles give the impression of going back in time and reversing activity; being in two places at once; and exhibiting contradictory behavior simultaneously.\n\nAmid this confusion, one fundamental truth has emerged. Physicists are now certain that objects behave differently when they are viewed and experienced. In support, they cite the so-called double-slit experiment, whereby a certain group of particles passing through a barrier will exhibit different properties if they are being watched. When scientists observe them, they behave like separate particles. But when they are not being watched, they unite in a wave.\n\nBased on this observation, Lanza has formulated his own version of biocentrism \u2014 the age-old worldview whereby life is the central fact of the universe. Basically, Lanza believes that life creates the universe, and not the other way around. Time, space, matter, and energy behave the way they do because they are observed and experienced by a bunch of living things. From this, it follows that life cannot simply \u201cend.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe think life is just the activity of carbon and an admixture of molecules \u2014 we live a while and then rot into the ground,\u201d Lanza writes on his website. But without life, there wouldn\u2019t be any ground to rot in.\n\n\u201cBottom line: What you see could not be present without your consciousness,\u201d he said, speaking to The Daily Mail. \u201cOur consciousness makes sense of the world.\u201d In death, our life simply becomes a \u201cperennial flower that returns to bloom in the multiverse.\u201d\n\nWhile Lanza\u2019s theory may strike most people as abstract and convoluted, it dovetails with a number of significant research papers published this year. In \u201cSurge of neurophysiological coherence and connectivity in the dying brain,\u201d researchers from the University of Michigan describe a sudden surge in brain activity following clinical death. In another study, scientists at the University of Oxford show that consciousness may be the result of so-called quantum entanglement.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "life after death, quantum mechanics, robert lanza biocentrism, multiverse life, double-slit experiment", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Robert Lanza's biocentrism holds life to be the irreducible fact of the universe around us.", "title": "Life After Death?
