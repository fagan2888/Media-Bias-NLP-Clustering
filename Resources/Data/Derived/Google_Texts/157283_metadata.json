While aggressive policing of those type of crimes will continue, police officers will take offenders to community based drop-off centers where case managers can refer them to community programs.\n\nOther strategies outlined in Mayor de Blasio\u2019s plan include the improvement of mental health screening before arraignment, restarting Medicaid for inmates upon their release, and the expansion of supervised pretrial programs and community services for more than 4,000 prisoners. Officials said the plan represents the most comprehensive overhaul of a municipality\u2019s criminal justice system.\n\n\u201cI think this is what criminal justice looks like in the 21st century,\u201d Elizabeth Glazer, the mayor\u2019s criminal justice coordinator, told the New York Times. \u201cPreventing crime is about more than the police and more than about prosecutors and defense lawyers and courts,\u201d said Glazer, also a co-chairwoman of a task force of city officials and community leaders that released a report.\n\nNew York City\u2019s correctional system counts among the United States\u2019 largest mental health facilities, due in part to the shuttering of community clinics in the 1980s and the subsequent incarceration of the mentally ill who would have otherwise used those services. Even as incarceration rates have fallen in recent years, the mentally ill prisoner population has grown to nearly 40 percent.\n\nThis population of mentally ill inmates often count among what a recent report described as \u201cfrequent fliers,\u201d or people who come in and out of Rikers Island multiple times. According to the report, many of the more than 400 people who had been jailed repeatedly within the last two years for minor offenses had substance abuse problems and suffered from a host of mental ailments, including schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.\n\nUnfortunately, long stays behind bars without any kind of treatment do nothing to improve the condition of the mentally ill, as detailed in a report last year that recounted instances when corrections officers severely beat more than 120 mentally ill inmates. According to that report, five of the reported beatings followed suicide attempts. The report also found that use of solitary confinement to punish inmates with mental health issues \u2014 a method that has been found to incite paranoia \u2014 has increased.\n\nIn April, the State Supreme Court of Manhattan extended court oversight of New York\u2019s correctional system to two more years after finding that the city didn\u2019t met the basic standards of care for mentally ill inmates.\n\nThe poor treatment of mentally ill prisoners, however, is not specific to New York City\u2019s correctional system. Today, the mentally ill \u2014 many of whom come from disadvantaged backgrounds and have substance abuse problems \u2014 account for nearly 70 percent of the nation\u2019s prison population. Common mental ailments include major depression, personality disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and Asperger\u2019s syndrome, a high-functioning form of autism.\n\nThat\u2019s why Glazer touts New York City\u2019s overhaul of mental health services for inmates as a step in the right direction during a time when the national conversation has shifted to law enforcement\u2019s treatment of marginalized populations. More importantly, de Blasio\u2019s plan comes on the heels of reforms in other correctional systems \u2014 including that of California, Illinois, and Maricopa County in Arizona \u2014 that don\u2019t address the holistic treatment of mentally ill inmates.\n\n\u201cWe see these frequent fliers, people who commit relatively small low level offenses, cycling through the system over and over and over again,\u201d Glazer told the New York Times. \u201cAnd the question is, how do we stop that? Clearly what we\u2019re doing now is not all that effective.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "\"I think this is what criminal justice looks like in the 21st century.\"", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "\"I think this is what criminal justice looks like in the 21st century.\"", "title": "New York City Unveils Unprecedented Overhaul Of Mental Health Care For Inmates", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/health/2014/12/02/3598145/new-york-city-mental-health/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/detention_jail.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "\"I think this is what criminal justice looks like in the 21st century.\"", "creator": "@SamPKCollins", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/detention_jail-319x213.jpg", "title": "New York City Unveils Unprecedented Overhaul Of Mental Health Care For Inmates", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-health", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/detention_jail.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/detention_jail.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2014-12-02T09:18:35+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/sampkcollinswriter"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "Health New York City Unveils Unprecedented Overhaul Of Mental Health Care For Inmates CREDIT: ShutterstockNew York City\u2019s growing population of inmates with mental health and substance abuse problems will soon receive public health services along almost every step of the criminal justice process, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio announced earlier this week.\nEven as incarceration rates have fallen in recent years, the mentally ill prisoner population has grown to nearly 40 percent.\nThe four-year, $130 million project aims to reduce recidivism among mentally ill inmates by focusing on treatment rather than punishment for minor, quality-of-life offenses.\nThe report also found that use of solitary confinement to punish inmates with mental health issues \u2014 a method that has been found to incite paranoia \u2014 has increased.\nThe poor treatment of mentally ill prisoners, however, is not specific to New York City\u2019s correctional system."}
