President Obama will veto the bill, and Congressional Democrats will vote to sustain his veto.\n\nRepublicans are using the reconciliation bill to appease conservatives who want the ACA repealed, and Planned Parenthood defunded. The fact that there is a companion clean government funding bill is the real prize.\n\nThe clean government funding bill will be signed by President Obama, so the result of the latest round of Republican drama will be that government stays open, ObamaCare is not repealed, and Planned Parenthood won\u2019t be defunded.\n\nThe whole process is full of unnecessary drama and show votes. Even though John Boehner was the worst Speaker of the House in modern history, without him, the crazy on the Republican side of the aisle may be completely unleashed.", "article_metadata": {"description": "House Republicans announced today that they are going to use the fast track process of reconciliation to pass a bill that repeals parts of ObamaCare and defunds Planned Parenthood.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "author": "Jason Easley", "og": {"site_name": "Politicus USA", "description": "House Republicans announced today that they are going to use the fast track process of reconciliation to pass a bill that repeals parts of ObamaCare and defunds Planned Parenthood.", "title": "The Insanity Begins As GOP Announces Bill To Repeal ObamaCare and Defund Planned Parenthood", "url": "http://www.politicususa.com/2015/09/25/insanity-begins-gop-announces-bill-repeal-obamacare-defund-planned-parenthood.html", "image": "http://15130-presscdn-0-89.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/obama-point-laugh.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-09-25T12:42:40+00:00", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 523732690, "app_id": 113462415332922, "pages": 186473214703370}, "keywords": "Editors' Picks,Featured News,Issues,politicususa,liberal,politics,sarah jones,jason easley,barack obama,hillary clinton,bernie sanders,msnbc,media", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/PoliticusUSA", "section": "Issues", "published_time": "2015-09-25T12:42:40+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-09-25T12:42:40+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2037\"", "article_summary": "Republicans are using the reconciliation bill to appease conservatives who want the ACA repealed, and Planned Parenthood defunded.\nThe fact that there is a companion clean government funding bill is the real prize.\nHouse Republicans announced today that they are going to use the fast track process of reconciliation to pass a bill that repeals parts of ObamaCare and defunds Planned Parenthood.\nThe Hill reported:House lawmakers will include repealing parts of ObamaCare in the fast-track process known as reconciliation, in addition to defunding Planned Parenthood, according to two lawmakers.\nThis bill unlike the dozens of other pointless bills to repeal ObamaCare is going to pass, but it doesn\u2019t matter."}
