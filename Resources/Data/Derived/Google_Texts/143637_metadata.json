Sign up here.**\n\nBuzz Cut:\n\n\u2022 2016 GOP Power Index: Trump\u2019s distraction helps rivals\n\n\u2022 Will GOP get the rap for Colo. shooting?\n\n\u2022 Doors open to donors at Hillary\u2019s State Department\n\n\u2022 Double whammy for Hillary on global warming\n\n\u2022 Cheese truck drivers beware\n\n\n\n2016 GOP POWER INDEX: TRUMP\u2019S DISTRACTIONS OPEN WAY FOR OTHERS\n\nRepublican frontrunner Donald Trump has been spending too much time on defense.\n\n\n\nTrump\u2019s efforts in the last two weeks have been largely focused on cleanup. First, it was defending an unsubstantiated claim that he saw \u201cthousands and thousands\u201d of Muslims publicly celebrated in New Jersey on Sept. 11, 2001. That gave way to Trump\u2019s mocking of a physically disabled NYT reporter, and Trump\u2019s subsequent back and forth with the newspaper over whether his mockery was intentionally accurate, or accidentally so. The reporter says he\u2019s known Trump for two decades.\n\n\n\nAnother attempted cleanup turned messy was Trump\u2019s effort to show support in the African-American community by heralding the backing of dozens of black pastors. After Trump crowed about a Black Lives Matter protestor at an Alabama rally being \u201croughed up\u201d by his supporters, Trump put together an event for today, which his campaign said would feature the endorsement of black religious leaders. After backlash from members of the group who said they had no intention of endorsing Trump, the public event was scaled back to a private meeting.\n\n\n\nNone of this matters particularly as it relates to the Republican nomination process. Trump\u2019s core supporters are not likely to be swayed by anyone\u2019s hurt feelings, or media fact-checking of their man\u2019s claims. And for the other three-quarters of the Republican electorate, it\u2019s all just further proof that Trump is a risky bet.\n\n\n\nBut while Trump has been preoccupied with his own messes, the rest of the Republican field has been able to sort itself out a bit.\n\n\n\nAs polling last week showed, Power Index leaders Sens. Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio continue to consolidate their positions. For the two candidates at the back of the pack, Ben Carson and Jeb Bush, time is growing shorter for a turnaround.\n\n\n\nThere is one candidate, however, who may yet shake up the race.\n\n\n\nCarly Fiorina has been looking for a way back into contention. Aside from a stepped-up media presence and more engagement from her super PAC, Fiorina can only do so much to make her own luck. If she is to be viable, it will be as a candidate of opportunity.\n\n\n\nEnter Chris Christie, the longshot contender who many suspected was running out of time for his presidential bid. A weekend endorsement from New Hampshire\u2019s largest newspaper, though, kicked off a frenzy of national media coverage about Christie\u2019s chances in the Granite State. Not too shabby for a guy currently running in seventh place there.\n\n\n\nIf Christie really can turn this media attention into a New Hampshire boomlet, it will prolong his presence in the race. That\u2019s bad news for both Bush and Ohio Gov. John Kasich, who have their own plans to revive flagging candidacies with strong New Hampshire showings. Even if Kasich bails out soon, Bush needs to be the only comeback kid to have any chance of revival.\n\n\n\nOther than Cruz and Rubio, who stands to benefit most from the three-man gubernatorial dogpile in New Hampshire? Fiorina, of course. She remains one of the best-liked GOP contenders, and if there\u2019s going to be an opening for a Rubio alternative among establishmentarians, Fiorina could fit the bill.\n\n\n\nMuch like, Mitt Romney in 2008 she could make a late play for the nomination if the frontrunner falters.\n\n\n\n1) Ted Cruz; 2) Marco Rubio; 3) Carly Fiorina [+1]; 4) Donald Trump [-1]; 5) Ben Carson; 6) Jeb Bush\n\n\n\nOn the radar - Chris Christie, John Kasich, Rand Paul, Mike Huckabee and Rick Santorum\n\n\n\n[Watch Fox: Chris Stirewalt joins \u201cThe Real Story with Gretchen Carlson\u201d in the 2 p.m. ET hour with the latest on who\u2019s up and who\u2019s down in the 2016 Power Index.]\n\n\n\nWhat would you say? - Give us your take on the 2016 Power Index.

SHOOTING?\n\nAs new details emerge from Friday\u2019s shooting at a Colorado Planned Parenthood abortion clinic much of the media focus has shifted to blaming Republicans and their unstinting opposition to federal funding for the organization. But Ben Domenech argues it won\u2019t work: \u201cAnd third \u2014 and this is where things get Alanis Morrissette chaotic Paladin-level ironic \u2014 this frame will not work because the media was so successful at squashing the very story they now cite as the source of [the shooter\u2019s] rage: the series of undercover videos, which have depicted behind-the-scenes activities and conversations at Planned Parenthood facilities across the country and with their top ranking officials, showing them engaging in legally questionable and ethically vile behavior, even to the point of negotiating the sale of baby parts for profit.\u201d\n\n\n\nWITH YOUR SECOND CUP OF COFFEE\u2026\n\nAs many cooks discovered last week, turkeys can be aggravating creatures. But the father of American literature, Mark Twain, knew that was especially true of live turkeys. Twain was born as Samuel Clemens 180 years ago today in the village of Florida, Mo. (\"The village contained a hundred people and I increased the population by 1 per cent,\u201d Twain would later write. \u201cIt is more than many of the best men in history could have done for a town.\u201d) Twain\u2019s youthful encounter with a turkey hen in the Missouri woods was the origin of what would be among his finest, funniest yarns. \u201cHunting the Deceitful Turkey,\u201d first published in 1906, is of course more about human foibles than those of game fowl:\n\n\n\n\u201cWhen a person is ignorant and confiding, this immoral device can have tiresome results. I followed an ostensibly lame turkey over a considerable part of the United States one morning, because I believed in her and could not think she would deceive a mere boy, and one who was trusting her and considering her honest.\u201d\n\n\n\nYou can read the whole thing here.\n\n\n\nGot a TIP from the RIGHT or the LEFT?

The AP describes: \u201c[Clinton] met or spoke by phone with nearly 100 corporate executives and long-time Clinton political and charity donors during her four years at the State Department between 2009 and 2013, records show\u2026Her availability to luminaries from politics, business and charity shows the extent to which her office became a sounding board for their interests. And her ties with so many familiar faces from those intersecting worlds were complicated by their lucrative financial largess and political support over the years -- even during her State Department tenure -- to her campaigns, her husband\u2019s and to her family\u2019s foundation.\u201d\n\n\n\nBuffett boosts Clinton cash machine - Free Beacon: \u201cA foundation financed by the billionaire investor Warren Buffet recently signed on as a member of the left\u2019s leading donor club, according to internal documents, joining a handful of other new \u2018partners\u2019 who will help bankroll liberal nonprofits, advocacy groups, and political vendors ahead of the 2016 elections. The NoVo Foundation is one of 10 individual and institutional Democracy Alliance donors that have signed on this year, according to those documents. Alliance \u2018partners\u2019 are required to contribute at least $200,000 per year to the groups in its portfolio of supported organizations.\u201d\n\n\n\n[Clinton will stump with Buffet in Omaha on December 16, the Omaha World-Herald reports.]\n\n\n\nDOUBLE WHAMMY FOR HILLARY ON GLOBAL WARMING\n\nFeeling the press of the Democratic elites gathered in Paris \u2013 some of whom have made big bucks from the issue \u2013 and those among the party base for whom the issue evoked a fervor akin to religion, Hillary Clinton called for \u201crobust American leadership\u201d at the climate talks in a Time op-ed.\n\n\n\nObama won\u2019t submit for Senate review- WaPo: \u201cWhatever agreement emerges from Paris, [President Obama] has no intention of submitting it to the Senate for ratification as a treaty.

Bush already give Obama the authority he needs to carry out climate commitments.\u201d\n\n\n\nFiorina says Obama \u2018delusional\u2019 over climate change security threat - Fox News: \u201cRepublican presidential candidate Carly Fiorina on Sunday called President Obama \u2018delusional\u2019 to think climate change is the country\u2019s biggest terror threat and criticized liberals and others trying to make a political statement about the recent Planned Parenthood shootings. \u2018That\u2019s delusional for President Obama, Hillary Clinton or anyone else to say that climate change is the biggest security threat,\u2019 Fiorina told \u2018Fox News Sunday.\u2019\u201d\n\n\n\nCHEESE TRUCK DRIVERS BEWARE\u2026\n\nAP: \u201cWhere\u2019s the beef? That\u2019s what authorities would like to know after someone stole 40,000 pounds of it from a meat plant in central Pennsylvania. State police say it happened Nov. 21 at Nicholas Meat near Loganton. According to troopers, a trucker loaded $110,000 worth of meat into a trailer during a scheduled pickup and drove off. He was supposed to deliver it by Monday to a company in Milwaukee, Wisconsin - but never showed up. A spokesman for Nicholas Meat says the customer notified him Tuesday about the missing product, which would have been enough to make 160,000 burgers. Police later discovered the driver used a fake ID to get the delivery contract. Authorities say the company information on the truck was also fraudulent. The investigation continues.\u201d\n\n\n\nChris Stirewalt is digital politics editor for Fox News. Want FOX News First in your inbox every day?
