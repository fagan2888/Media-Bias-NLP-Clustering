That will cut down on confusion.\u201d\n\nAnd when insurance companies deny a claim deeming the procedure not medically necessary, OhioHealth aggressively appeals the case, Schuler said.\n\n\u201cWe use clinical information to put that information together,\u201d she said. \u201cIf we don\u2019t get paid on those, those are write-offs. We fight hard for those dollars.\u201d\n\nOhioHealth also sorts through claims denied due to coordination of benefits around the primary versus secondary payer.\n\nThe fight has paid off in the millions of dollars.\n\nOhioHealth\u2019s final write-off for fiscal 2014 was .10 percent of patient revenue, according to Schuler, amounting to $6 million. The industry standard is 1 to 2 percent.\n\nBad debt used to represent small portion of revenue and was all but ignored, but the rise of high deductible plans suggests healthcare providers can no longer afford to leave that money on the table.\n\nIt\u2019s getting them the information they need to stop worrying about the bill and concentrate on their medical needs.\n\nFor example, 2 percent of unpaid gross revenue is considered the industry standard. But OhioHealth is at 1.21 percent, Schuler said.\n\nThe organization is aggressive in collecting debt from patients, but it does all it can to prevent the bill from going that far, beginning with giving the patient an estimate of out-of-pocket expenses at registration.\n\nInpatients are visited by a financial counselor bedside, according to Schuler.\n\n[Also: What CFOs think about revenue cycle]\n\nThose without insurance or who can\u2019t pay the high deductible are referred to an interest-free payment plan or assistance program.\n\nOhio has an expanded Medicaid program, which has helped, Schuler said.\n\nIn 2014, five hospitals in the OhioHealth system converted 45 percent of the self-pay population onto Medicaid.\n\n\u201cWe were able to convert $216 million for 2014,\u201d she said.\n\nOhioHealth also has its own internal charity program which offers additional discounts.\n\n\u201cThere are many ways to get that medical bill paid,\u201d Schuler said.\n\n[Register for the Revenue Cycle Solutions Summit]\n\nThe Healthcare Financial Management Association recognized OhioHealth as among the 2014 winners of the MAP Award for High Performance in Revenue Cycle.\n\nAll of what OhioHealth does is part of what Schuler calls the \u201csecret sauce\u201d to revenue cycle, and relieves the patient of the burdensome question, \u201c\u2019How do I pay for this?\u2019\u201d\n\nBryon Health CFO Russ Gronewold in Lincoln, Nebraska agrees patients need to be informed up-front of what they can expect to pay, but admits that\u2019s a challenge for the trauma center.\n\nThe focus when a patient comes through the door is getting him or her stabilized, he said.\n\n\u201cWe focus on the payment once their stable,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s getting them the information they need to stop worrying about the bill and concentrate on their medical needs.\u201d\n\nBryon Health falls in the median range for collecting payment, he said.\n\n\u201cWe do a good steady job,\u201d Gronewold said. \u201cOur price estimate on the front end is one of the areas we\u2019re working on going over the next year.\u201d\n\nThe staff also does a good job qualifying patients for financial assistance, he said.\n\n\u201cWe are not an aggressive up-front collector,\u201d Gronewold said. \u201cWe\u2019re strong on the back-end as far as diligence, aggressive in qualifying people for the charity care program,\u201d which he said is liberal, up to 400 percent of the poverty level.\n\n[Also: How consumerism is changing revenue cycle]\n\nBryon uses a regional bank in which every patient automatically qualifies for a loan, he said.\n\n\u201cPatients are worried about the financial, so knowing how they\u2019re going to pay for care relieves them of that burden.\u201d\n\nBoth OhioHealth and Bryon deal with bill payment in-house.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve felt that we\u2019ve done a pretty good job by holding onto those,\u201d Gronewald said.\n\nOther providers find it makes financial sense to farm out that work.\n\nThe vendor option\n\nFor a fee, vendors such as CarePayment of Lake Oswego, Oregon offer financial management products with zero interest plans to collect bill payment while other companies provide patients with a single medical credit card to consolidate bills.\n\nBaptist Health Care in Florida has been using CarePayment for about a year.\n\n\u201cWhile we now are primarily using CarePayment when accounts are overdue, we want to make a major shift to offering CarePayment at registration and point of service, which studies show is much more effective,\u201d said Senior Manager Amy Davis.\n\nFollow Healthcare Finance on Twitter and LinkedIn.\n\nBaptist Health Care has seen a $4 million increase in the amount of total collections this year, Davis said, from $30 million to $34 million.\n\nDay Kimball Healthcare in Connecticut has used CarePayment for about four years, allowing patients up to 25 months to pay at zero interest.\n\nThe amount of bad debt at Day Kimball has been holding flat, even as the number of patients has increased, according to Sarah Ginnetti, director of revenue cycle.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve not seen that same incremental shift in bad debt,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s prevented bad debt from growing.\u201d\n\nNeither Davis nor Ginnetti gave the cost of the program, but both said the collections it has generated has more than offset the cost.\n\nMore than a financial gain, the program is a patient benefit, Ginnetti said.\n\nPatients who can pay their bills think more highly of their providers, and will be more prone to choose the same facility for future care, said CarePayment CEO Craig Hodges.\n\nThe program has been around for about 10 years.\n\n\u201cThe growth acceleration started two years ago with the advent with the growth in high deductible plans,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cNow our footprint is 483 provider locations across the country.\u201d Crozer-Keystone Health System partners with CarePayment, offering patients the option to finance medical expenses for up to 25 month at no interest, according to CFO and Senior Vice President Philip Ryan .\n\n\u201cWe have seen a strong increase in people paying more out of pocket for medical services, from those with group health insurance to others with high deductible coverage and even senior citizens who can no longer afford a Medicare supplemental plan,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cThe bigger impact is when we help patient on the front end. There\u2019s a much higher engagement of payment.\u201d\n\nTwitter: @SusanMorseHFN", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/expert-tips-better-billing-and-collections-healthcare", "image": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/Deleware-Health-Center-facebook-feature.gif", "site_name": "Healthcare Finance News", "description": "Collect financial information upfront, fight insurance denials, and send a combined bill from hospital and physician among advice for hospital finance staff.", "title": "Expert tips for better billing and collections in healthcare"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/Deleware-Health-Center-facebook-feature.gif"}, "title": "Expert tips for better billing and collections in healthcare", "description": "Collect financial information upfront, fight insurance denials, and send a combined bill from hospital and physician among advice for hospital finance staff.", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@HC_Finance"}, "viewport": "width=device-width; initial-scale=1.0; maximum-scale=1.0; user-scalable=no", "description": "Health systems are looking to better their accounts receivables process and are employing a host of new methods to make the collections process smoother.&#13; OhioHealth is one of the few in the industry that has begun issuing a single bill from both hospital and physician when the doctor is employed by the hospital.&#13; \u201cWe are moving towards a single business office,\u201d said Margaret Schuler, executive director of revenue cycle at the health system. \u201cI\u2019m able to send a single statement to the patient.
