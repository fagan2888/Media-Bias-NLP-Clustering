We must work to prioritize laws to guarantee that women have full and fair opportunities to succeed and raise healthy families. One way to do that is to stand with women and support workplace policies that protect women from discrimination, harassment, and maternity penalties on the job.\u201d\n\nSpeakers at the press conference highlighted SB 219 as an example of one of those polices. The bill would ensure all working nursing mothers have reasonable break time and a sanitary, private location \u2013 other than the bathroom \u2013 to express breast milk. Federal law currently only covers hourly workers. SB 219 successfully passed in the Senate earlier this year, but was retained in House Commerce.\n\n\u201cWe stand with New Hampshire women in support of their right to breastfeed where and when their babies need and their right to work place friendly lactation policies that allow them to express their milk during work breaks so that their children may continue to receive the proven benefits of breastmilk even when Mom is not nearby,\u201d said Kary Jencks, executive director of NH Citizens Alliance. \u201cAs a mother who breast fed all three of my children I personally know the importance of creating breastfeeding supportive communities and workplaces.\u201d\n\nBill sponsor, Senate Majority Leader Jeb Bradley, R-Wolfeboro, stated that, \u201cSB 219 has my support, the support of the full Senate, and the support of the BIA because the bill will reasonably accommodate breast feeding families and support the businesses who employ them, improving New Hampshire\u2019s productivity and making it an even better state to live and work.\u201d\n\nPrime bill sponsor, state Sen. Martha Fuller Clark, D-Portsmouth, stated that, \u201cSB 219 is an attempt to address the fact many working women never undertake breastfeeding or stop nursing their children upon returning to work because they have no access to decent accommodation at their place of employment. Nationally when women stop breastfeeding prematurely, a total of $126.1 million in indirect costs is incurred in time away from work for sick employees and babies. Women make up half the workforce and are the primary breadwinners in 41% of families with children. And of the more than 350,000 working women in New Hampshire today, nearly half are between the ages of 20 and 44 - prime years for giving birth to children. Passage of SB 219 would encourage working mothers to breastfeed their children. It would help to ensure healthy and prosperous families and save New Hampshire businesses many thousands of dollars in sick days and the loss of able and skilled women employees.\u201d\n\nOn the federal level, U.S. Sens. Jeanne Shaheen, D-NH, and Kelly Ayotte, R-NH, are working on legislation to protect pregnant women and nursing mothers in the work place. Representatives from each office issued a statement for the \u201cBreastfeeding and Work \u2013 Let\u2019s Make It Work\u201d press conference:\n\nU.S. Senator Jeanne Shaheen: \u201cAs Governor, I was pleased to sign into law the Breastfeeding Bill which protects the rights of mothers in New Hampshire to breastfeed in public. I was also proud to support the breastfeeding provisions in the Affordable Care Act, which requires insurance plans to cover breastfeeding support, supplies and counseling with no co-pay. I continue to work with the Department of Health and Human Services to ensure that these provisions are implemented as Congress intended. Women should have every right to reasonable workplace accommodations as they provide for their families and contribute to the economy. That\u2019s why I introduced the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act. This legislation would ensure that expectant mothers are not forced out of their jobs simply because they need minor adjustments to their duties to continue working during pregnancy. As more women work longer into their pregnancies, they should have the confidence that their safety, health and financial security are not at risk. And when they return to work following childbirth, they deserve every opportunity to provide for their child without retaliation or interference.\u201d\n\nU.S. Senator Kelly Ayotte: \u201cAs someone who worked during both of my pregnancies and also breastfed, I understand the challenges facing pregnant women and new mothers in the workplace. To ensure that pregnant workers and nursing moms are treated equally in the workplace, Senator Shaheen and I recently introduced the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act (PWFA), bipartisan legislation that would require employers to make reasonable accommodations for pregnant employees and new moms. The PWFA is modeled on the legal standard in the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), and would ensure that pregnant workers and nursing moms are able to continue working while protecting them from being forced to take unpaid time off or leave their jobs altogether. The bill also prohibits employers from denying employment opportunities to women based on their need for reasonable accommodations related to pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions.\u201d\n\nAlso at the press conference was Christine Dodson, co-founder of Mamava which creates lactation and breastfeeding stations, including the one at Fenway Park.\n\n\u201cWhen the idea for Mamava first struck, we were nursing mothers working for a breastfeeding friendly employer, and benefiting from Vermont\u2019s progressive breastfeeding laws. At work we had a place to pump and the break time to do it. It was when we traveled for business that we ran in to challenges, often having to pump in restrooms, cars, and storage closets. We thought about all the other moms in other states, with less supportive employers and challenged ourselves to find a way to make it easier for mamas to meet their breastfeeding goals, and employers and communities to support them. So our free standing lactation suite was conceived from a place of empathy by nursing mothers who had to hit the road with our breast pumps. As it takes hold as an amenity for pumping and nursing we think of it as a billboard communicating that there are many, many breastfeeding moms who could use all the help they can get, actually bringing the discussion into the open \u2013 not hiding it in a bathroom stall or under a blanket.\u201d\n\nFollowing the press conference, Terie Norelli, president of the NH Women\u2019s Foundation, led a count-down to the Big Latch On, a synchronized worldwide breastfeeding event to raise awareness during World Breastfeeding Week.\n\nThe New Hampshire World Breastfeeding Week kick-off and day of events were hosted by NH Citizens Alliance, Granite State Progress & Education Fund, the NH Breastfeeding Rights Coalition & The Rustik Baby Project, with sponsor support.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Concord, NH Patch", "description": "New Hampshire Big Latch On event part of Stand With Women campaign to secure public policy advances for women and their families.", "title": "Activists Kick Off World Breastfeeding Week at Statehouse", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.patch.com/users/546351/2015/07/T800x600/20150755bc1eee12f0a.JPG", "url": "http://patch.com/new-hampshire/concord-nh/activists-kick-world-breastfeeding-week-statehouse", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": 116541048368485, "section": "Politics & Government", "published_time": "2015-08-01T09:01:50-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-08-01T09:01:50-04:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 521361477908471}, "description": "Concord, NH - New Hampshire Big Latch On event part of Stand With Women campaign to secure public policy advances for women and their families.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd40c8\"", "article_summary": "The theme of this year\u2019s World Breastfeeding Week is \u201cBreastfeeding and Work \u2013 Let\u2019s Make It Work,\u201d according to a press statement.\nI was also proud to support the breastfeeding provisions in the Affordable Care Act, which requires insurance plans to cover breastfeeding support, supplies and counseling with no co-pay.\n\u201cWhen the idea for Mamava first struck, we were nursing mothers working for a breastfeeding friendly employer, and benefiting from Vermont\u2019s progressive breastfeeding laws.\nThe bill would ensure all working nursing mothers have reasonable break time and a sanitary, private location \u2013 other than the bathroom \u2013 to express breast milk.\nElected leaders and advocates for women and their families kicked off World Breastfeeding Week at the New Hampshire Statehouse on Friday with calls for family-friendly workplace and public policies."}
