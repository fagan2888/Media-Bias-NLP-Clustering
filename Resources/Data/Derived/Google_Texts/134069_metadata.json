Ed Royce, R-Calif. \u201cMeanwhile, Tehran has been advancing its nuclear program. These actions clearly violate the spirit of the interim agreement. Yet the administration seems more concerned that sanctions could sink an agreement. Let\u2019s be clear: if an agreement is sunk, it is because Iran has no interest in abandoning its drive to nuclear weapons, which is what many of us believe.\u201d\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s be clear: if an agreement is sunk, it is because Iran has no interest in abandoning its drive to nuclear weapons, which is what many of us believe,\u201d says @RepEdRoyce.\n\nIran is currently under some sanctions. How are those working out?\n\nAt the House Foreign Affairs Committee hearing, Robert J. Einhorn, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution in Washington, asserted that the current sanctions enacted under the interim agreement are having a powerful impact on Iran\u2019s economy.\n\n\u201cIran continues to feel immense pressure under existing sanctions,\u201d said Einhorn, who once served as assistant secretary of state for nonproliferation under President Bill Clinton.\n\n\u201cAlthough companies around the world have held discussions with Iran in the hope of entering or reentering the Iranian market, they are taking a very cautious approach, waiting for a nuclear deal to be concluded and sanctions to be removed before taking the risk of signing new contracts. The Treasury Department estimates that in 2014, oil sanctions alone deprived Iran of about $40 billion in oil revenues.\u201d\n\nBut though its economy is hobbled, Iran has been experiencing some economic growth and lowered inflation in trying to rebound from a recession.\n\nIf talks collapse and Iran works to build a nuclear bomb, why would that matter?\n\nEric S. Edelman, the under secretary of defense in the Bush administration, said at the House hearing that preventing a nuclear Iran is \u201cthe most pressing national security challenge today.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt would threaten the elimination of Israel and risk triggering a nuclear-arms race in region,\u201d Edelman said.\n\nIran is thought to be assisting Shi\u2019a militias in Iraq, which Edelman says has \u201cfed the resurgence of the Islamic State.\u201d\n\nIn Syria, Iran\u2019s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps provides aid to the brutal regime of President Bashar al-Assad.\n\nAnd Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen have taken over much of the country in recent months, resulting in the resignation of the country\u2019s American-backed president.\n\nHow would additional sanctions help or hurt the negotiations meant to stop Iran\u2019s nuclear ambitions?\n\nEinhorn believes Congress should stay out of the way, even though the sanctions being talked about would only go into effect if the new negotiation timeline passes without a deal.\n\n\u201cNew sanctions legislation at this time, even if not imposed until later on, would have the unintended effect of hardening Iran\u2019s position and weakening the U.S. position,\u201d Einhorn said.\n\n\u201cOpponents would seize on this by saying that the U.S. has no intention of ultimately removing sanctions, therefore an agreement is pointless. We should be patient.\u201d\n\nFreshman Democratic Rep. Brendan Boyle of Pennsylvania, speaking at the Tuesday hearing, has a more nuanced position on Congress\u2019 role in the success or failure of the talks.\n\n\u201cI am someone who is generally a supporter of the president, but with that said, I can\u2019t understand the logic of saying that if there are no sanctions today but sanctions by a day certain, how we would be seen as responsible for sinking these negotiations,\u201d Boyle said.\n\nNo matter the showdown in Congress, Iran\u2019s ultimate position will be determined by Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who is seen as skeptical of the talks.\n\n\u201cMy view is that if the supreme leader wants a deal, there will be a deal,\u201d Edelman told The New York Times.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Daily Signal answers burning questions that still surround negotiations over Iran's nuclear program.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The Daily Signal answers burning questions that still surround negotiations over Iran's nuclear program.", "title": "What You Need to Know About Debate on Iran Sanctions", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/zumaglobal393846.jpg", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1zZgaxU"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The Daily Signal answers burning questions that still surround negotiations over Iran's nuclear program.", "title": "What You Need to Know About Debate on Iran Sanctions", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/zumaglobal393846.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "International", "tag": "International,middle east", "published_time": "2015-01-28T17:28:57+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Iran, sanctions, Israel, Iraq, Robert Menendez, Mark Kirk, Benjamin Netanyahu, nuclear, House Foreign Affairs Committee, John Kerry"}, "article_summary": "At the time, negotiators insisted that an interim agreement would continue to restrain any attempt by Iran to develop a nuclear weapon.\nHow would additional sanctions help or hurt the negotiations meant to stop Iran\u2019s nuclear ambitions?\nIn his State of the Union address, President Obama had a strong message for a Congress angling to impose new sanctions on Iran: stay out of my way.\nNo matter the showdown in Congress, Iran\u2019s ultimate position will be determined by Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who is seen as skeptical of the talks.\nThese actions clearly violate the spirit of the interim agreement."}
