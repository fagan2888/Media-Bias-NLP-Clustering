Soon after they arrived the doctor told Kate and her husband David that the boy didn\u2019t make it, WQAD reported.\n\nKate said she grabbed the baby from the doctor and asked her husband to help her surround the baby with body heat.\n\n\u201cI ordered David to get his clothes off and get into bed with me because I wanted as much body heat around this baby as possible because he was cold and I wanted him to be warm and alive,\u201d Kate recalled.\n\nShe said she held the baby close, letting the baby hear her heartbeat. Talking to the baby, Kate said she and David told him about his sister, his family, and the plans they had for him.\n\n\u201cSo, we\u2019re bawling our eyes out and holding him and then he started to move, and we thought, \u2018What? What\u2019s happening?\u2019\u201d\n\nKate said she called the midwives back into the room and told them the baby was moving and breathing. Kate recalled that the midwives said the baby was dying and that she needed to say goodbye.\n\n\u201cAnd we never let go of him,\u201d Kate said. \u201cHis skin was against mine the entire time.\u201d\n\nThe baby then opened his eyes and grabbed his dad\u2019s finger. The parents got to take their twin babies home and with the arrival of another son a year later, they are the parents of three growing children.\n\nKate said the baby was able to survive because of the body heat of his mother and father holding him.\n\nDownload Fox 5 iPhone app | Download Fox 5 Android app", "article_metadata": {"description": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPnpSaFtBaA In a Johnson\u2019s Baby Care commercial, a young mom shared her experience of when she thought she lost her son at his birth.
