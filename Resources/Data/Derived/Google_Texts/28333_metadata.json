( Craig Miller/KQED )\n\nThe breast cancer rate in Marin County \u2014 once called the highest in the world \u2014 is now at the lowest level since tracking started in 1988 and matches the statewide average, according to a new analysis.\n\nThe question, of course, is why.\n\n\u201cA whole lot of people are scratching their heads over this one,\u201d said Tina Clarke, an epidemiologist with the Cancer Prevention Institute of California and the study\u2019s lead author.\n\nTo be fair, Clarke can explain part of the decline. But before we get into more detail on that, a bit of history.\n\nIn 1994, a report from CPIC (then called Northern California Cancer Center) identified the high rate of breast cancer in Marin County, compared it to that of countries around the world and concluded that the Marin County rate was the highest.\n\nWomen in Marin, an affluent county, have \u201ca whole cluster of established risk factors for breast cancer,\u201d Clarke said. These risk factors tend to go along with being more affluent: later age of childbearing, if at all, and higher alcohol consumption. White women are at slightly higher risk of developing breast cancer than are women of other races or ethnicities.\n\nThrough the 1990s, breast cancer rates for non-Hispanic white women in Marin climbed 60 percent, compared to 5 percent in other parts of the Bay Area. It reached its peak in 2001.\n\nThe rate started to fall after a major study was halted in 2002, when researchers identified a link between use of hormone replacement therapy and breast cancer. Affluent women were also more likely to use hormone therapy.\n\nWomen abandoned the hormones in droves, and the breast cancer rate started to fall, in Marin and nationwide.\n\nBut Marin county\u2019s breast cancer rate still exceeded the statewide average until a second drop started in 2007. That\u2019s what researchers can\u2019t quite account for.\n\nClarke said it\u2019s likely due to a host of reasons \u2014 perhaps women are exercising more or losing weight, two other factors that reduce risk of breast cancer. It\u2019s also possible women are consuming less alcohol, she said.\n\nOne factor they know is not responsible: the change in mammography screening guidelines. In 2009, a major government panel, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, recommended women have fewer mammograms. Researchers found no evidence that this recommendation has led to less breast cancer being found, in part because the incidence of ductal carcinoma in situ \u2014 or DCIS \u2014 is increasing.\n\n\u201cThe increased incidence of in situ cancer suggests a decline in mammography screening likely is not a key factor contributing to the decline in invasive breast cancer in Marin County,\u201d Dr. Karly Kerlikowske, a UCSF epidemiologist said in a release.\n\nWhatever the reason, \u201cWe\u2019re really happy to see things trending in the right direction,\u201d Clarke said. \u201cWe\u2019re obviously delighted to tell women in Marin County that the rates are similar to the rest of the state.\u201d\n\nSince 2001, the breast cancer rate in Marin has dropped 31 percent. Mortality has also sharply declined. Since record-keeping began in 1988, the death rate from breast cancer has dropped 65 percent.\n\nAn interesting footnote: Clarke said that monitoring incidence rates is based on county-level census data. It\u2019s highly likely, she said, that similarly affluent areas in California, like Palo Alto or West LA, might have had the same pattern of a higher rate \u2014 fueled at least in part by hormone therapy \u2014 and the decline that Marin has seen.", "article_metadata": {"description": "\"A whole lot of people are scratching their heads over this one,\" study author says.", "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"Marin County's Breast Cancer Rate Has Plummeted.
