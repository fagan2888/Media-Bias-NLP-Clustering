Johnson, and according to Obama, his Affordable Care Act kicked off where those two programs\u2019 legacy left off. \u201cIf one of the best measures of a country is how it treats its more vulnerable citizens \u2013 seniors, the poor, the sick \u2013 then America has a lot to be proud of,\u201d said the president, adding that Obamacare ensures Americans can easily access basic medical services.\n\n\u201cThese promises we made as a nation have saved millions of our own people from poverty and hardship, allowing us new freedom, new independence, and the chance to live longer, better lives,\u201d Obama continued, addressing the media. \u201cThat\u2019s something to be proud of. It\u2019s heroic.\u201d\n\nIn celebration of Medicare and Medicaid\u2019s 50th anniversary, Obama promised to protect the programs from conservative lawmakers who insist that the government should dial down on them, if not completely eliminate them. He said that critics of the programs who believe they are \u201cin crisis\u201d are merely searching for a \u201cpolitical excuse\u201d to reduce funding, privatize them, or eliminate them altogether.\n\nGoing forward, Obama hopes that more Americans, particularly aging Baby Boomers, will take advantage of Medicare and Medicaid. He also noted that Obamacare\u2019s criticism from Republicans is nothing new as far as government programs are concerned. \u201cWhen FDR created Social Security, critics called it socialism,\u201d said Obama. \u201cWhen JFK and LBJ worked to create Medicare, the cynics said it would take away our freedom.\n\n\u201cBut ultimately, we came to see these programs for what they truly are \u2013 a promise that if we work hard, and play by the rules, we\u2019ll be rewarded with a basic measure of dignity, security, and the freedom to live our lives as we want.\u201d\n\nLaugh of the day:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Modern Readers", "description": "Issuing his weekly address Saturday, President Barack Obama said that his Affordable Care Act, more popularly known as Obamacare, had \u201cfinished the job\u201d that Medicare and Medicaid started almost 50 years ago to this day.
