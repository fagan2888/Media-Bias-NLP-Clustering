Snowfall sweeping through the Midwest will reach New Jersey Sunday evening and continue through Monday morning, Accuweather.com reports.

The latest forecast shows the heaviest snowfall, a predicted 6 to 12 inches, accumulating in the southern half of the state. The northern part of the state can expect to see 3 to 6 inches.

Commuters will likely see major delays Monday morning, while airports could also be affected by the storm.

National Weather Service has issued a winter storm watch for most of New Jersey, warning that visibility could be limited to as little as a quarter mile at times.

After the storm, temperatures could plunge below zero.

The storm could also wreak havoc — once again — on mass transit and schools.
