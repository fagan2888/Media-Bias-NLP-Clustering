But Congress doesn\u2019t want to hear about it.\n\nThis got drowned out by the roar of the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s thunderbolts. But our state\u2019s insurance commissioner just went to Congress and told them some news that, had they been anybody but members of Congress, they might have found really interesting.\n\nOne: The share of people in Washington state with no health coverage now is the lowest ever recorded, Mike Kreidler testified.\n\nTwo: The rates insurers have requested to charge for policies in the individual insurance market next year are the lowest price increases in the 14 years Kreidler has been in office.\n\nGood news, right?\n\nThe committee didn\u2019t think so. Many members of the U.S. House Ways and Means subcommittee either didn\u2019t believe Kreidler or just appeared to ignore what he was saying.\n\n\u201cYou made a statement that things are looking better,\u201d one Republican congressman fumed. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t look like it\u2019s looking better to me.\u201d\n\nYou\u2019re presenting an alternate version of reality, another GOP congressman challenged Kreidler. Premiums in the congressman\u2019s district were soaring by 30 percent, he said.\n\n\u201cWashington must be the only state\u201d where this is happening, joked a third.\n\n\u201cNo, they didn\u2019t give me an inch,\u201d Kreidler, a Democrat, recapped Friday back in his Olympia office.\n\nAfter the Supreme Court upheld Obamacare on Thursday, two GOP congressmen from this state, Dave Reichert and Dan Newhouse, both put out statements decrying the law for jacking up insurance premiums \u2014 a point that had been contradicted just the day prior by our own insurance office.\n\nKreidler testified that after years of double-digit premium increases, the average rates requested this year are up only 5.4 percent. By comparison, every year from 2008 to 2012 the individual market rates in the state went up double digits, from a low of a 12 percent increase in 2011 to 18 percent in 2009.\n\n\u201cIn our state it isn\u2019t true that Obamacare is causing big premium hikes,\u201d Kreidler told the committee.\n\nAs with anything involving health insurance, premiums are only part of the story. Many customers have complained, rightly so, about rising deductibles and copays.\n\nThe requested premiums also vary widely by company and plan. Group Health has proposed a 3 percent price cut, for example, while a company called Moda asked for a 21 percent price boost. One could cherry-pick Moda\u2019s prices and conclude Obamacare is a disaster, but all in all, this is what passes for a tame overall insurance market.\n\nThe refusal to admit anything might be trending right with Obamacare has become almost pathological.\n\nTake the news that the uninsured rate in the state has plummeted to 8.5 percent. That\u2019s the lowest figure, by a great deal, since the U.S. Census began surveying on the topic back in 1987.\n\nThe new data means our state suddenly is zeroing in on a historic benchmark \u2014 what technically could be called universal coverage. \u201cTechnically\u201d because about 5 percent of people either are exempt from Obamacare or are ineligible for its benefits (such as immigrants living in the country illegally). So 95 percent coverage is about as high as the state is expected to get under current laws.\n\nWe\u2019re within a few hundred thousand people of achieving that \u2014 a goal that has eluded health reformers for 75 years.\n\n\u201cThe goal\u2019s in sight,\u201d Kreidler said. \u201cIt\u2019s tremendously exciting. I\u2019m not sure how many people know that.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s galling is how many members of Congress don\u2019t want to know. They have been so strident against Obamacare for so long that any positive news about it simply cannot exist.\n\nThis denialism has to end. There are a slew of problems with the law that need fixing. But it can\u2019t happen because Republicans in Congress remain obsessed with the reform being a total failure.\n\nC\u2019mon, change is in the wind. We\u2019re moving past the culture wars. We even appear to be getting over the Civil War. Time to end the health-care wars, too.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Suddenly our state is in sight of reaching a goal that has eluded health reformers for decades: universal coverage.
