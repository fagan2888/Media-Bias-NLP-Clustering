Only five orders were placed after looking at the menu in the store, or 1.5 percent.\n\nMenu Labeling from Menu Labeling on Vimeo.\n\n\u201cCalorie counts and solutions to help educate customers are important,\u201d a narrator in the video says. \u201cIn fact we want you to know that information and that is why we already provide it on our website, and we\u2019ve been doing so for over a decade.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe government would like us to have this information available on boards in the store,\u201d a representative for Domino\u2019s tells a customer in the video.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no way that that would be possible,\u201d a customer replies. \u201cThat would be obnoxious, costly\u2026 annoying.\u201d\n\n\u201cCrazy, I think,\u201d said another.\n\nDomino\u2019s also put up a dozen menu boards at the entrance of the store, showing what it would look like if their restaurants complied with the standards, listing every single pizza, sauce, crust, topping, and menu item possible.\n\nThe menu overwhelmed customers.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m totally confused and lost,\u201d one said.\n\nA bipartisan bill introduced in the House by Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R., Wash.) would give businesses more flexibility in complying with the calorie rule, and allow restaurants that primarily rely on carry out orders to display their calories online.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Domino\u2019s continues to push back against a regulation mandated by the president\u2019s health care law, releasing a new video that shows their customers calling the calorie posting rule \u201cobnoxious\u201d and \u201cannoying.\u201d", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Free Beacon", "description": "Domino\u2019s continues to push back against a regulation mandated by the president\u2019s health care law, releasing a new video that shows their customers calling the calorie posting rule \u201cobnoxious\u201d", "title": "Domino\u2019s Customers Call Obamacare Reg \u2018Obnoxious, Costly, Annoying\u2019", "url": "http://freebeacon.com/issues/dominos-customers-call-obamacare-reg-obnoxious-costly-annoying/", "image": "http://freebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/AP223978942936-150x150.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Domino\u2019s continues to push back against a regulation mandated by the president\u2019s health care law", "title": "Domino\u2019s Customers Call Obamacare Reg \u2018Obnoxious, Costly, Annoying\u2019", "image": "http://freebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/AP223978942936-150x150.jpg", "creator": "@LizWFB", "site": "@freebeacon", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1047859882", "fb": {"app_id": "FB_APP_ID", "pages": 282024895179874}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "In the new video, Domino\u2019s shows one store that received 324 orders in one day.\nOnly five orders were placed after looking at the menu in the store, or 1.5 percent.\n\u201cCalorie counts and solutions to help educate customers are important,\u201d a narrator in the video says.\n\u201cThat would be obnoxious, costly\u2026 annoying.\u201d\u201cCrazy, I think,\u201d said another.\nMenu Labeling from Menu Labeling on Vimeo."}
