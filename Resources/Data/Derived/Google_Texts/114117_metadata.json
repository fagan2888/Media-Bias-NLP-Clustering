It\u2019s called \u201cscapegoating,\u201d and humans have a long history of it. We blame others for our own hardships because, well, it\u2019s easier than dealing with the fact that most, if not all, our problems are the result of choices we made.\n\nHow many people do you know who\u2019ve been fired from a job and said something along the lines of \u201cMy boss hated me?\u201d People have been fired out of spite, but for the most part, it doesn\u2019t happen to great employees. Know any good carpenters unable to find work? I mean really good carpenters, craftsmen who show up on time, don\u2019t over-charge, do great work and don\u2019t leave a mess? I bet you don\u2019t, because they are in demand, no matter how bad the economy is.\n\nI know plenty of people who are or have been out of work for long periods of time, and most of them have attitudes that make being around them for extended periods of time a difficult proposition. Not only do I know them, I was one of them. I\u2019ve had more jobs than anyone else I know, and I dare say anyone you know, or even any three people you know. At last count I\u2019ve held, for varying lengths of time (mostly very short periods of time), 63 jobs. No, that\u2019s not a typo.\n\nYou name it, I\u2019ve probably been paid to do it, for at least an hour or two before quitting or being fired.\n\nRoofing, construction, concrete, electrician\u2019s assistant, deli counter, softball scorekeeper, busboy, waiter, bartender, fast-food, slow-food, bulk-food, a boat radiator factory, aluminum brake factory, door-to-door sales. I could go on but you get the idea. And I was fired more times than I can count from many of those jobs because of my attitude. I hung around with people whose days revolved around having enough money to get drunk or high as many nights as possible. That was our priority; that was our lives.\n\nI couldn\u2019t really afford college after high school, and it wasn\u2019t a priority. My parents didn\u2019t graduate high school, and my siblings (I\u2019m the youngest of five) hadn\u2019t gone to college, so it wasn\u2019t discussed. My high school wasn\u2019t exactly a conduit to great things, so college wasn\u2019t pushed on anyone. I\u2019d applied to one school, Wayne State in Detroit, because the application fee was only $20 and they were coming to my high school to give immediate admission to people who qualified. You needed only a 2.0 GPA and a few other people were doing it. And the idea of college beat the thought of working for a living, so I did it. They accepted me.\n\nThe government said I didn\u2019t qualify for financial aid, so I went for a half-year with the money I had saved (majoring in theater, if that gives you any idea of how aimless I was). When the money ran out, I was done.\n\nI bounced from one hated job to another for a few years, until one day my girlfriend at the time\u2014who had graduated college and knew the importance of it\u2014suggested I try college again.\n\nMostly to placate her, I filled out a new financial aid form, and because of my age, my poverty\u2014I\u2019d cracked the 5-digit income level only once, when I made $12,000\u2014qualified me for aid. I was shocked, and more than a little excited, to have a chance at something more.\n\nIt was just a chance, a shot, I would have to take it and make something of it myself, but I had it. But for it to work, for it to lead anywhere, my attitude had to change.\n\nTo that point, I\u2019d blamed just about everyone I\u2019d come in contact with for my poverty and misery. Not that they\u2019d done anything to me. They were just luckier, either by birth or some other circumstance, than I was. I was angry at the world for\u2026pretty much existing.\n\nIt took me those lost years to realize if I wanted to assign blame for my crummy lot in life I need only find the nearest reflective surface. Sure, other people were born into different circumstances, more money, a family that stressed education and a place that planned a little more than \u201cyou graduate high school, get a job, and that\u2019s about it.\u201d But they weren\u2019t holding me back, I was. There was no grand conspiracy of the illuminati and chemtrails plotting to keep me down. It was me.\n\nOnce I started to shake off the chains of resentment and take responsibility for my life\u2014and I hope you\u2019re sitting down for this\u2014it got exponentially better. It\u2019s not perfect. It\u2019s not all wine and roses. But I aspire. And that\u2019s the key.\n\nAfter burning myself with hot roofing tar, drilling a hole through my fingernail, and getting a hernia from lifting cases of copper tubes, I made different choices in my life that brought me from Detroit to Washington, D.C., where I\u2019d always wanted to be.\n\nI\u2019d always been interested in politics, but I went from volunteering on campaigns every couple of years to being a health policy analyst in a prestigious think tank, serving as a press secretary in the U.S. Senate, managing federal affairs at a powerful activist group, co-founding a successful news website, writing and hosting a talk radio show, to God only knows. There\u2019s no logical sense to my career path, but I\u2019ve loved every minute of it.\n\nAnd I wouldn\u2019t have had any of it had I not stopped blaming others for my failures, for my problems.\n\nMany of my friends from those days are still angry, still looking outside themselves for their bouncing around from one miserable job to the next. One told me a few years ago that I \u201cwas lucky\u201d to get out and do what I\u2019d done. That still sticks with me because it wasn\u2019t luck, and I told him so at the time.\n\nHe didn\u2019t like that, still doesn\u2019t. But sitting around telling the world what all you can do and counting on someone to hear you, believe you, believe in you and then pay you a lot of money to do it is not a plan. You have to do it. Then, and only then, will the world (possibly) recognize it and reward it.\n\nThis is why I\u2019m a conservative and always have been.\n\nI support the idea of a helping hand \u2013 a hand-up, not a handout \u2013 I wouldn\u2019t be where I am without it. But I easily could have gone the other way too. I was earning enough to get by \u2013 rent was cheap, beer was cheaper. I wasn\u2019t happy, but I was comfortable enough. It\u2019s the same for the myriad welfare programs that give people just enough to make it from one EBT Card direct deposit to the next.\n\nA subsistent existence, with no strings attached, saps aspiration, drains the human spirit. That\u2019s what the poverty trap of government life gives you \u2013 just enough \u2013 with the threat of it all going away should you try to improve your life by working and earning more.\n\nThe social safety net has turned into a cross between a hammock and a spider web \u2013 comfortable and incredibly difficult to escape.\n\nThe question is how desperate are you to escape it\u2014particularly when there is an industry, built around a political party and philosophy, designed to keep people in it.\n\nProgressives benefit from poverty, from envy, from that anger. They stoke it. The 1 percent, income inequality, \u201cthe rich,\u201d all are scapegoated by progressives to people like I was in the hope they think they\u2019re not well-off because someone else is.\n\nThat it works so well is a testament to the power of resentment. Scapegoating\u2019s long history demonstrates what a powerful and evil weapon it is. Murder, wars, the Holocaust, much of history\u2019s greatest crimes stem from scapegoating.\n\nHitler blamed Germany\u2019s economic woes on the Jews, and the people bought it. Hamas blames Palestinian poverty on the Jews even as it squanders an untold fortune on offensive weapons and tunnels, and progressives perpetuate this slander. Democrats blame poverty in America on the people who lift themselves out of poverty, and they receive the votes of those they\u2019ve snared in that web.\n\nThere\u2019s a pattern there.\n\nNo one is poor because someone else is rich. No one is trapped anywhere but in their own lives. But resentment and scapegoating works. It\u2019s not going to stop being the most powerful weapon progressives have to manipulate people around the world until more people find the person I found in my rear-view mirror on my way to my roofing job more than a decade ago \u2013 the only person responsible for your lot in life \u2013 you.", "article_metadata": {"description": "It\u2019s a tradition as old as time \u2013 blaming someone else for one\u2019s own problems..05/26/2016 18:53:28PM EST.", "author": "Derek Hunter", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "It\u2019s a tradition as old as time \u2013 blaming someone else for one\u2019s own problems.", "title": "Derek Hunter - The Power Of Scapegoating", "url": "http://townhall.com/columnists/derekhunter/2014/08/10/the-power-of-scapegoating-n1876843", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2014/213/3856a5b3-3fae-4b26-a46c-eff9e80d184a.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "It\u2019s a tradition as old as time \u2013 blaming someone else for one\u2019s own problems.", "title": "Derek Hunter - The Power Of Scapegoating", "url": "http://townhall.com/columnists/derekhunter/2014/08/10/the-power-of-scapegoating-n1876843", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2014/213/3856a5b3-3fae-4b26-a46c-eff9e80d184a.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "The Power Of Scapegoating, Derek Hunter, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "My high school wasn\u2019t exactly a conduit to great things, so college wasn\u2019t pushed on anyone.\nMy parents didn\u2019t graduate high school, and my siblings (I\u2019m the youngest of five) hadn\u2019t gone to college, so it wasn\u2019t discussed.\nI couldn\u2019t really afford college after high school, and it wasn\u2019t a priority.\nIt\u2019s called \u201cscapegoating,\u201d and humans have a long history of it.\nThat it works so well is a testament to the power of resentment."}
