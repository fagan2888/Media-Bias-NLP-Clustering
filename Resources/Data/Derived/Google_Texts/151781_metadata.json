There\u2019s no ethical reason, he suggested.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no hideous \u2018Fairness Doctrine\u2019 affecting print media on the Internet \u2013 not yet, at least,\u201d said Farah. \u201cWhy should pure political speech, protected by the First Amendment so the people can be informed, be buried at the very time it is most important? Why should candidates be forced to buy snippets of time to get their views before the public?\u201d\n\nSo Farah contacted Dr. Carson and offered him an exclusive forum for his views in WND every week. He gratefully accepted the opportunity, and his new weekly column begins today and will be published each Wednesday.\n\nCarson\u2019s keynote address at the National Prayer Breakfast in February 2013 catapulted him to national prominence among those Americans who reveled in his courageous and articulate rebuttal to the Obama presidency.\n\nSince that time, Carson, professor emeritus of neurosurgery at Johns Hopkins University, has been talked about as the perfect outsider candidate for the Republican nomination for president in 2016. He currently is in the \u201cexploratory\u201d mode, but is expected to make an announcement about his future plans May 4 in his hometown of Detroit.\n\nWill some accuse Dr. Carson of getting a free ride for his views at WND at the expense of other presidential candidates \u2013 Republicans and Democrats? Farah has an answer to such a charge.\n\n\u201cI invite every serious, bona fide presidential candidate \u2013 Democrat and Republican, Libertarian and others associated with smaller parties \u2013 the same opportunity,\u201d said Farah. \u201cOur commitment to Dr. Carson does not imply an endorsement of his candidacy. It\u2019s a commitment by WND to create a wide-ranging forum for the views of all serious presidential candidates \u2013 the more the merrier. Let a thousand flowers bloom.\u201d\n\nPresidential candidate interested in taking advantage of this unique opportunity to reach millions of voters with their ideas, views and values are encouraged to contact columns@wnd.com for more information about submitting both regular columns or occasional special commentaries.\n\nRead Dr. Carson\u2019s first exclusive column for WND, \u201cCommon ground with Al Sharpton.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Free Press For A Free People Since 1997", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.1", "og": {"site_name": "WND", "description": "WASHINGTON \u2013 When Dr. Ben Carson\u2019s weekly column was dropped by his syndicate last month because of his possible candidacy for the presidency in 2016, WND\u2019s Joseph Farah scratched his head in bewilderment. \u201cWhy should the American people be denied the opportunity to hear from Dr. Carson in his own unadulterated words every week at [\u2026]", "title": "Ben Carson now exclusively at WND", "url": "http://www.wnd.com/2015/04/ben-carson-now-exclusively-at-wnd/", "image": "http://www.wnd.com/files/2014/05/ben-carson.jpg", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 152299868169938}, "google-site-verification": "5iw1bKISvQcI1qRwIskRfer6GKV4jUf6LImfS9bhaeI", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Will some accuse Dr. Carson of getting a free ride for his views at WND at the expense of other presidential candidates \u2013 Republicans and Democrats?\n\u201cOur commitment to Dr. Carson does not imply an endorsement of his candidacy.\nIt\u2019s a commitment by WND to create a wide-ranging forum for the views of all serious presidential candidates \u2013 the more the merrier.\nWhy should candidates be forced to buy snippets of time to get their views before the public?\u201dSo Farah contacted Dr. Carson and offered him an exclusive forum for his views in WND every week.\nRead Dr. Carson\u2019s first exclusive column for WND, \u201cCommon ground with Al Sharpton.\u201d"}
