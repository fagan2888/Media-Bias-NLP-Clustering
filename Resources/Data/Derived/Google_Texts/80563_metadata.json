Here are five worthy candidates for the most-hated tax title.\n\n1. Disguised taxes in the form of phase-out rules\n\nOne of the favorite tricks of politicians is to create a tax break, bask in the glow of the favorable publicity, and then take away the break from those whose income is deemed to be \u201ctoo high.\u201d For example, personal and dependent exemption deductions, the most popular itemized deductions \u2014 the child tax credit, the higher-education tax credits, and many other breaks \u2014 are subject to phase-out rules that reduce or completely eliminate your eligibility as your income goes up the ladder. In effect, these phase-outs are disguised tax rate increases that Congress has never had to admit to.\n\n2. Forced taxation of retirement account accumulations\n\nDo you have money in an IRA or 401(k) account? Once you turn age 70 1/2, you must start taking annual requirement minimum distributions (RMDs). Guess what? Those RMDs are taxable, which is why Congress dreamed up the RMD rules in the first place. In other words, the government wants to get its hands on some of your retirement account money sooner rather than later. If that means you don\u2019t have enough to live on during retirement, too bad for you. For details on RMDs, read this. That article only deals with IRAs, but the RMD rules for other types of tax-favored retirement accounts are essentially the same.\n\nTrump's tax plan (2:05) Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump outlines his tax-plan proposal, if elected next U.S. president.\n\n3. The net investment income tax\n\nThe grossly misnamed American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 raised the maximum federal income tax rate on long-term capital gains and qualified dividends from 15% to 20%. The maximum rate on short-term capital gains, interest income, rental income, and most other types of investment income was raised from 35% to 39.6%. Unfortunately, that was not the end of it. The Obamacare legislation added a 3.8% Medicare surtax on net investment income collected by higher income folks and by estates and trusts. The IRS calls the surtax the net investment income tax or NIIT. It can hit income from capital gains, dividends, interest, rents, royalties, profits from passive business ownership interests (such as partnership and LLC interests and S corporation stock), and even profits from home sales. So when you hear the maximum federal rate on long-term gains and dividends is \u201conly\u201d 20%, please cry foul. It is actually 23.8% thanks to the NIIT (20% + 3.8%). And the maximum federal rate on most other types of investment income, including short-term gains, is actually 43.4% thanks to the NIIT (39.6% + 3.8%).\n\nRead: How to avoid the surtax on investment income\n\n4. The $100 per-day penalty tax for paying an employee\u2019s individual health policy premiums\n\nObviously, it would be a mortal sin for any employer to pay the premiums for an employee\u2019s individual health policy. Right? Of course! That\u2019s why the Obamacare legislation imposes a $100 per-employee per-day penalty for doing so. That adds up to $36,500 per employee for a full year of committing this unpardonable act.\n\nBack when it looked like the Supreme Court might deal a death blow to Obamacare, there was hope that this penalty would be abolished. That hope has been dashed.\n\nRead: What changes to Obamacare could mean for small-business taxes\n\n5. The generation-skipping transfer tax\n\nThis is a federal tax on transferring wealth to individuals who are more than one generation younger than you. The classic example is when grandparents set up trusts or college accounts for their grandchildren. Thankfully, the generation-skipping transfer tax (GSTT) is only a concern for wealthy folks who can afford to give away lots of money or assets to younger generations, but that doesn\u2019t make it more acceptable in my view. The two reasons for hating the GSTT are: (1) the rules are tricky and full of traps for the unwary and (2) the 40% GSTT rate is on top of any gift tax (also at a 40% rate) on the same transfer.\n\nRead: What you need to know about the grandparent tax\n\nThe last word\n\nDid I leave out a tax that you love to hate?
