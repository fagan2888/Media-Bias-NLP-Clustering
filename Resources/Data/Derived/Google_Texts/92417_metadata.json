It\u2019s a rich tradition they have. In 1936, when Franklin Roosevelt came up with Social Security, a Republican filibuster stopped FDR from funding the offices and personnel he needed to implement it. In addition to that, Alf Landon, the Republican candidate for president said, \u2018My first act of office will be to abolish Social Security.\u2019 \u201d\n\n\u2014 Sen. Richard Durbin (D-Ill.), interview on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe,\u201d Sept. 16, 2013\n\nIn explaining why the Affordable Care Act, aka Obamacare, continues to be unpopular with many Americans, Sen. Durbin cited the unrelenting attacks by Republicans. But then he ventured into some historical fantasy to illustrate what he called the GOP\u2019s \u201crich tradition\u201d of not accepting new social programs.\n\nLet\u2019s look at what really happened.\n\nThe Facts\n\nSocial insurance originated in Germany in 1889, at the behest of Chancellor Otto von Bismarck, and the United States was relatively slow to adopt the concept. Indeed, it was not Franklin Roosevelt but his one-time Republican cousin Theodore Roosevelt who first called for adopting social insurance in a speech in 1912. For those who think Congress works slowly today, note that that Franklin Roosevelt was not able to sign the Social Security Act until 1935.\n\nBut in contrast to the Affordable Care Act \u2014 which passed without a single Republican vote in either the Senate or the House \u2014 the passage of Social Security was quite bipartisan (in an era when Democrats enjoyed large majorities in both chambers.)\n\nIn the House, 284 Democrats and 81 Republicans supported the bill, compared to 15 Democrats and 15 Republicans who opposed it. In the Senate, 60 Democrats and 16 Republicans supported the bill, with just one Democrat and five Republicans opposed. (Update: A reader correctly points out that before this final vote, at the committee level there were significant efforts by Republican lawmakers to change or gut the old-age provisions of the bill.)\n\n\u201cAlthough Social Security was the initiative of a Democratic president, by the time the bill arrived on the floor of Congress a substantial bipartisan majority had developed in its favor,\u201d says an official history of the Social Security administration. \u201cIt would be fair to say that at its inception Social Security was a bipartisan program, and has been so for most of its history.\u201d\n\nWith that kind of support, why would Republicans filibuster the funding, as Durbin claims? Well, actually, they did not.\n\nThe filibuster cited by Durbin was conducted by Sen. Huey Long of Louisiana \u2014 a Democrat to the left of FDR \u2014 and he was arguing for additional funds for cotton and wheat farmers; money to implement Social Security just happened to be in the same bill. This was Long\u2019s famous \u201cswan song\u201d filibuster, made during his last appearance in Congress; he was assassinated a few weeks later.\n\nIn any case, the delay in the funding bill did not hold up Social Security. Roosevelt simply moved some funds from the Labor Department until a permanent appropriations bill could be passed when Congress came back into session a few months later.\n\nAs for Alf Landon, the Kansas governor and GOP nominee in the 1936 election, the truth is more complicated than saying he simply wanted to repeal the law.\n\nLandon actually supported most of Roosevelt\u2019s New Deal initiatives and in effect had to be drafted to run against him. He also did not oppose Social Security, but he was dismayed at how it was financed \u2014 through payroll deductions from workers\u2019 paychecks, which were used to pay current beneficiaries in exchange for government bonds that would be used to pay the workers when they retired. Landon wanted to finance Social Security out of general revenues and he did not want benefits to be tied to wages.\n\n\u201cThere is every probability that the cash they pay in will be used for current deficits and new extravagances,\u201d Landon warned in a critique of the Social Security trust funds that won favor with the editorial page of The New York Times at the time. \u201cWe are going to have trouble enough to carry out an economy program without having the Treasury flush with money drawn from the workers.\u201d\n\n(Want to know more about the financing of Social Security? Read our popular Social Security primer.)\n\nAs Landon put it in his convention acceptance speech, \u201cWe shall amend the Social Security Act to make it workable. We recognize that society, acting through government, must afford as large a measure of protection as it can against involuntary unemployment and dependency in old age. We pledge that the Federal Government will do its proper share in that task.\u201d\n\nStill, Landon\u2019s proposed changes likely would doomed Social Security, as it might have been perceived as another welfare program\u2013making it easier to later eliminate. Roosevelt\u2019s financing structure, which tapped into workers\u2019s wages, was designed to show Americans that everyone had contributed fairly to the program.\n\nIn the heat of the campaign, moreover, Landon called Social Security \u201ca fraud on the working man\u201d and a \u201ccruel hoax\u201d on workers. This harsh rhetoric prompted the first head of Social Security, a Republican named John G. Winant, to resign from his post so he could actively campaign against the nominee of his own party. Winant eventually endorsed FDR.\n\nLandon was defeated in a massive landslide. \u201cAfterward Landon conceded that his attack on Social Security had been a mistake,\u201d the Social Security history says. \u201cSubsequently he went on record against any attempt to dismantle Social Security.\u201d\n\nMax Gleischman, a spokesman for Durbin, said the senator was relying on the book \u201cCitizens of London,\u201d by Lynne Olson, which focuses on Americans who supported Britain at the start of World War II. One key character is Winant, who after helping FDR in the 1936 election eventually became U.S. ambassador to the United Kingdom.\n\nThe book is a great read, but the brief section on Winant\u2019s involvement in Social Security barely does justice to the complex issue \u2014 and it does not label Long\u2019s filibuster as a \u201cRepublican filibuster.\u201d Presumably Durbin simply leaped to that conclusion.\n\nDurbin \u201cwas making the point that attempts to defund Social Security in the 1930s are similar to attempts to defund/repeal Obamacare today,\u201d Gleischman said. \u201cInitially unpopular programs were implemented despite obstruction and attempts to delay and went on to become \u2013 in Social Security\u2019s case \u2013 the most popular government run program.\u201d\n\nThe Pinocchio Test\n\nDurbin has mischaracterized the history of GOP support for Social Security. In contrast to his depiction of filibuster and delay, the law passed with Republican support and there was no effort by Republicans in Congress to thwart its funding through a filibuster. The GOP candidate for president did make the financing of Social Security an election issue \u2014 a debate that continues to this day.\n\nDurbin might want to consult something other than a history of the Battle of Britain for information on Social Security. (UPDATE: Durbin later acknowledged his error on the Senate floor.)\n\nThree Pinocchios\n\n\n\n\n\n(About our rating scale)\n\nCheck out our candidate Pinocchio Tracker\n\nFollow The Fact Checker on Twitter and friend us on Facebook", "article_metadata": {"description": "Sen.
