REUTERS/Shannon Stapleton\n\n4410825\n\nAmericans have to be prepared for an increased individual mandate tax to hit in just two weeks, but the White House still hasn\u2019t gotten around to approving the Internal Revenue Service paperwork on the requirement.\n\nThe IRS is trying to comply with federal rules that require White House approval on its new paperwork for the individual mandate. But the White House has rejected one proposal and ignored another, according to new research from the American Action Forum, a free-market think tank headed by former Congressional Budget Office director Douglas Holtz-Eakin.\n\nThe IRS\u2019 workload was upped drastically by the individual mandate, which will require Americans to submit a tax form proving they have health insurance or pay a growing fine to the agency. It appears the Obama administration was running behind on the paperwork requirements as well as pretty much everything else.\n\nThe IRS submitted a proposal for collecting the individual mandate tax to the White House on Aug. 23, 2013, just four months before the individual mandate began to take effect. The agency requested approval by Aug. 26 \u2014 a unexpectedly quick turnaround for approval of any regulation, according to AAF.\n\nTurns out, the White House didn\u2019t approve the paperwork after all. AAF found that the White House rejected the proposal almost a year later \u2014 putting the three-day request to shame. It appears the White House preferred the individual mandate tax to be bundled with income tax collection, which the country goes through every spring.\n\nBut the IRS had already submitted a proposal to the White House for that purpose in April 2014, months before the White House rejected its year-old proposal. Right now, there\u2019s no official IRS doctrine on how exactly the agency is supposed to be collecting the individual mandate penalty, or, as the administration calls it, the \u201cshared responsibility payment.\u201d\n\nBy collecting data from Americans about their health insurance status without approving the regulations, the White House could be violating the Paperwork Reduction Act, according to the study.\n\nThe administration already cut back on the number of Americans who would be subject to the individual mandate by issuing new exemptions, prompting the Congressional Budget Office and Joint Committee on Taxation to lower their estimate of how much the tax will collect for the federal coffers.

On Jan. 1, just weeks away, that fee jumps to $325 or two percent of annual income, an even bigger bill.\n\nTax experts are already expecting the 2015 tax season to be the most complicated yet, as a result of Obamacare exchange estimating premium subsidies that could leave customers owing the federal government. Now ongoing uncertainty about those who didn\u2019t get around to purchasing health insurance could add to the confusion.\n\nFollow Sarah on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Sarah Hurtubise", "description": "'Little more than a hollow legal shell'", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "Americans have to be prepared for an increased individual mandate tax to hit in just two weeks, but the White House still hasn't gotten around to approving the Internal Revenue Service paperwork on th", "title": "White House Still Hasn\u2019t Approved IRS Paperwork On Individual Mandate", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2014/12/16/white-house-still-hasnt-approved-irs-paperwork-on-individual-mandate/", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/2014-05-09T194540Z_1_CBREA481IWD00_RTROPTP_4_USA-TAX-IRS-CRITERIA-e1406579699573.jpg", "height": 274}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "'Little more than a hollow legal shell'", "title": "White House Still Hasn\u2019t Approved IRS Paperwork On Individual Mandate Via @dailycaller", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2014/12/16/white-house-still-hasnt-approved-irs-paperwork-on-individual-mandate/", "image": {"src": "http://dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/2014-05-09T194540Z_1_CBREA481IWD00_RTROPTP_4_USA-TAX-IRS-CRITERIA-e1406579699573.jpg"}, "creator": "@@SarahMHurtubise", "site": {"identifier": "@dailycaller", "id": 39308549}, "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-12-16 06:00:05", "sailthru.title": "White House Still Hasn't Approved IRS Paperwork On Individual Mandate", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "sailthru.tags": "obamacare,sarah-hurtubise", "fb": {"app_id": 143489452702, "pages": 182919686769}, "keywords": "obamacare", "sailthru.description": "Americans have to be prepared for an increased individual mandate tax to hit in just two weeks, but the White House still hasn't gotten around to approving the Internal Revenue Service paperwork on th", "sailthru.image.full": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/2014-05-09T194540Z_1_CBREA481IWD00_RTROPTP_4_USA-TAX-IRS-CRITERIA-e1406579699573.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "The IRS submitted a proposal for collecting the individual mandate tax to the White House on Aug. 23, 2013, just four months before the individual mandate began to take effect.\nThe IRS is trying to comply with federal rules that require White House approval on its new paperwork for the individual mandate.\nBut the IRS had already submitted a proposal to the White House for that purpose in April 2014, months before the White House rejected its year-old proposal.\nIt appears the White House preferred the individual mandate tax to be bundled with income tax collection, which the country goes through every spring.\n\u201cThe individual mandate is little more than a hollow legal shell, practically unenforced by the administration.\u201d\u201cThe individual mandate almost certainly won\u2019t be part of the 2015 tax season\u201d because the tax paperwork just isn\u2019t ready, the report concluded."}
