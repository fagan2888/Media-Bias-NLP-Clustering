Major policy initiatives, like immigration reform, cap-and-trade legislation, or gun-control, are frustratingly out of reach.\u201d\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\n\u201cDespite President Obama\u2019s surprisingly comfortable re-election margin,\u201d Bhatnagar wrote, \u201cit seems the New New Deal Coalition is not strong enough to pass its own legislative agenda. That means Democrats must expand the political map beyond the current Obama comfort zone. This election cycle, there is no more promising opportunity to do so than the Kentucky Senate race between Republican Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and Democratic challenger Alison Lundergan Grimes.\u201d\n\nBhatnagar expressed a fairly negative view of Kentucky in his article.\n\n\u201c[P]erhaps no state benefitted [sic] more from the original New Deal than Kentucky,\u201d he wrote, \u201cand as, one of the poorest, unhealthiest, and shortest-lived states in the country, it also stands to benefit from the liberalism of the New New Deal.\u201d\n\nBhatnagar sang the praises of the benefits Kentuckians are experiencing from Obamacare.\n\n\u201cObamacare alone has helped almost half a million Kentuckians sign up for health insurance,\u201d he wrote, adding that \u201cpolling shows Kentuckians prefer Democratic positions on economic issues like the minimum wage and pay equity. Kentucky is a state both willing to listen to Democratic ideas and in need of more liberal policies.\u201d\n\nFederal Election Commission reports indicate that Bhatnagar has been on the payroll of the Kentucky State Democratic Central Executive Committee since July.\n\nBreitbart News asked Grimes campaign spokesperson Charly Norton if Bhatnagar was hired to work in Kentucky based on the views he expressed in this article but has not yet received a response.\n\nBhatnagar\u2019s LinkedIn profile, which contained his work history, was deleted on Wednesday.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Akshai Bhatnagar, a field organizer for the Alison Grimes Senate campaign in Kentucky, wrote an article for the Johns Hopkins Politik Magazine in April of this year titled", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Akshai Bhatnagar, a field organizer for the Alison Grimes Senate campaign in Kentucky, wrote an article for the Johns Hopkins Politik Magazine in April of this year titled", "title": "Alison Grimes Field Organizer: Obama's Legacy Depends on Kentucky Senate Race - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Big-Government/2014/2014-Candidates/grimes-obama-ap.jpg", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2014/10/08/another-grimes-field-organizer-barack-obama-s-new-new-deal-depends-on-this-year-s-kentucky-senate-race/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Akshai Bhatnagar, a field organizer for the Alison Grimes Senate campaign in Kentucky, wrote an article for the Johns Hopkins Politik Magazine in April of this year titled", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Big-Government/2014/2014-Candidates/grimes-obama-ap.jpg", "title": "Alison Grimes Field Organizer: Obama's Legacy Depends on Kentucky Senate Race - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "app_id": 1243316582352556, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Congress, Mitch McConnell, Senate,Big Government,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Big Government", "tag": "Senate", "published_time": "2014-10-08T19:17:00-07:00", "categories": "Big Government"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcfcc8\"", "article_summary": "This election cycle, there is no more promising opportunity to do so than the Kentucky Senate race between Republican Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and Democratic challenger Alison Lundergan Grimes.\u201dBhatnagar expressed a fairly negative view of Kentucky in his article.\nKentucky is a state both willing to listen to Democratic ideas and in need of more liberal policies.\u201dFederal Election Commission reports indicate that Bhatnagar has been on the payroll of the Kentucky State Democratic Central Executive Committee since July.\nBreitbart News asked Grimes campaign spokesperson Charly Norton if Bhatnagar was hired to work in Kentucky based on the views he expressed in this article but has not yet received a response.\nBhatnagar\u2019s LinkedIn profile, which contained his work history, was deleted on Wednesday.\nThat means Democrats must expand the political map beyond the current Obama comfort zone."}
