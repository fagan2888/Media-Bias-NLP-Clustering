Coler, 28, and Ronald A. Williams, 27, on the Pine Ridge Reservation in South Dakota. The murders were horrific: The two young agents went to the Reservation to arrest a fugitive, a shootout occurred, they were outnumbered, and when they attempted to surrender they were shot in the head, at close range.\n\nLaw enforcement, the victims\u2019 families and the public have an obvious interest in holding someone accountable for the murders.\n\nHaving lost the criminal trials against the first two men charged with the murders, however, government agents reportedly broke the law to ensure that Leonard Peltier would not get off. According to court records: agents provided false affidavits to a court; testimony was coerced; and critical documents that conflicted with the government\u2019s primary theory of the case were withheld from Peltier\u2019s attorneys.\n\nBased on a record that many courts today would characterize a \u201ccorrupted investigation,\u201d a jury found Peltier guilty. Reviewing courts did not reverse the conviction, but in a truly extraordinary move, the judge who authored the opinion that upheld the guilty verdict later urged the Committee on Indian Affairs to take action to release Peltier, writing:\n\n\u201cthe US government over-reacted \u2026 and must share responsibility for the ... firefight\u2026. The FBI used improper tactics in\n\nsecuring Peltier\u2019s extradition ... and in otherwise investigating and trying the Peltier case.\u201d\n\nHumanitarians from around the world have called for Peltier's release and after four decades of controversy, he is an icon who symbolizes the historic and continuing injustices facing many American Indians: forced relocations, breached treaties, coercive removals of children, involuntary sterilization of women, racism, abuse in the hands of law enforcement and worse.\n\nThe argument for Peltier\u2019s release is exceptionally compelling, particularly when viewed in its historic context.\n\nThe murders of agents Coler and Williams occurred in the wake of the 1973 uprising at Wounded Knee on the Pine Ridge Reservation, a violent episode that reflected a boiling point of discontent over problems in Native communities. During the FBI\u2019s well-meaning but Waco-like response and eventual retreat, the crisis escalated, and undermined the community\u2019s already rocky relations with federal authorities.\n\nOn June 26, 1975, Special Agents Coler and Williams went to the unstable Pine Ridge Reservation to hunt for a fugitive without proper back-up. This is neither to cast blame on the federal government nor to justify the murders - but to provide context. We send fully loaded Navy Seal teams into less dangerous situations, to ensure the team\u2019s safety.\n\nIt is significant that just miles away from where the agents were shot, less than a century earlier more than 100 unarmed Lakota men, women and children were murdered at Wounded Knee by the 7th Cavalry. Although a Concurrent Resolution of Congress expressed \u201cdeep regret\u201d for the Massacre, the US government refuses to revoke more than 20 Medals of Honor that were issued to Military Officers and men who murdered the unarmed Lakota.\n\nPeople instinctively reply that Lakota families should \u201cget over\u201d the Massacre at Wounded Knee, and yet, they never would suggest that the Coler and Williams families should \u201cget over\u201d the federal agents\u2019 deaths.\n\nThe only way to reconcile our government\u2019s perpetual celebration of the senseless deaths of hundreds of unarmed Lakota with its heavy-handed and uncompromising pursuit of justice for the senseless deaths of two federal agents, is to place a significantly lower value on the lives of hundreds of Lakota men, women and children.\n\nPerhaps the greatest irony, however, is that the integrity of the system of justice that Special Agents Coler and Williams died for is tarnished if\u2014as courts have reported\u2014to secure Peltier\u2019s conviction, federal agents over-reached, turned a blind eye to leads that weakened their case and withheld relevant evidence that they were sworn to produce to Peltier\u2019s attorneys.The American justice system is designed to protect both the innocent and the guilty.\n\nAlthough the murder of two FBI agents is among the most significant crimes imaginable, Peltier has spent four decades in prison and justice has been served for the murders of Special Agents Coler and Williams.\n\nNow, it is time to give due respect to the integrity of the American system of justice for which the brave federal agents died. It is time for President Obama to grant Clemency to Leonard Peltier.\n\nCynthia K.
