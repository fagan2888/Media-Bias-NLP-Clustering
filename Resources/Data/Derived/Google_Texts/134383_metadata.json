The Chairman of the Committee is Indiana Senator Dan Coats, while Senator and Presidential candidate Ted Cruz is a member.\n\nFirst Response is in the business of cleaning up damage caused by things like fires and storms. Sergio says he knows \u2018disaster\u2019 when he sees it. \u201cI would label this as a disaster, yes, I think this is, in my opinion, it is the worst thing I have seen in my lifetime domestically for the United States.\u201d\n\nFor instance, Sergio says he now employs just under 50 workers and if he goes over that amount he\u2019ll face added health insurance coverage obligations under the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cAll the consequences around Obamacare are on punishing growth at a time we need jobs we need growth its punishing growth,\u201d Sergio said.\n\nSergio says if he needs to beef up his staff on a seasonal basis, he\u2019ll likely hire part time workers and keep their hours under 30 per week\u2014to avoid another threshold for the mandatory provision of coverage.\n\n\u201cCommon sense says you reward a behavior, an activity, you get more of it: You punish an activity, you get less of it. We well know that we're born that way,\u201d Sergio explained. \u201cAnd so that's what I'm speaking up on. It's just saying hey, we're feeling it, we're seeing it, this is nonsense, repeal Obamacare.\n\nSergio says his health insurance premiums went up 25 percent this year, while he had to pass along substantially increased deductibles to employees that include many family members.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "\u201cI personally am calling for a complete repeal of Obamacare,\u201d Joseph Sergio said.", "language": "english", "author": "Mark Peterson", "og": {"url": "http://www.wndu.com/home/headlines/SB-business-owner-called-to-Congress-to-testify--305755411.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/559*315/First+Response.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "\u201cI personally am calling for a complete repeal of Obamacare,\u201d Joseph Sergio said.", "title": "SB business owner called to Congress to testify"}, "twitter": {"description": "\u201cI personally am calling for a complete repeal of Obamacare,\u201d Joseph Sergio said.", "title": "SB business owner called to Congress to testify", "url": "http://www.wndu.com/home/headlines/SB-business-owner-called-to-Congress-to-testify--305755411.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/559*315/First+Response.jpg", "creator": "@WNDU", "site": "@WNDU", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "keywords": "SB business owner called to Congress to testify", "fb": {"app_id": 98635293203, "pages": 173450631129}, "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "google-site-verification": "x60Yt-TZkIYBJxeRz2teidOKEg-UGBB3SLOggpZk7GQ", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "SB business owner called to"}, "article_summary": "\u201cAll the consequences around Obamacare are on punishing growth at a time we need jobs we need growth its punishing growth,\u201d Sergio said.\nA South Bend small business owner is set to testify before Congress in Washington, D.C. this week.\nThe topic will be the Affordable Care Act: The speaker will be co-owner of First Response Disaster Restoration Specialists.\nSergio is one of four speakers set to testify before the Joint Economic Committee on Wednesday afternoon.\nThe Chairman of the Committee is Indiana Senator Dan Coats, while Senator and Presidential candidate Ted Cruz is a member."}
