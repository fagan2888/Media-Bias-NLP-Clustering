Two years after that, her mother was diagnosed with lung cancer.\n\n\u201cI was emotionally exhausted,\u201d said Rowe, 45, who lives in Takoma Park, Maryland, with her wife and boys, ages 6 and 9.\n\nRowe is on the cusp of a fast-growing population \u2014 a mashup of Generation X and millennials \u2014 starting to care for young and older loved ones.\n\nThe term \u201csandwich generation\u201d was coined in the 1980s to describe people squeezed between taking care of children and parents. Now, as members of the baby boom are entering their 70s, that sandwich is poised to become a footlong.\n\nThere are about 75 million baby boomers in the United States, and many are beginning to experience the changes nobody wants and nobody likes to talk about: disease and chronic conditions. They are starting to look to their children for assistance.\n\nThe boomers\u2019 children, meanwhile, tended to have babies in their 30s and 40s, meaning that it\u2019s not uncommon to juggle young children and a mom or dad in need of care.\n\n\u201cI was sad I was spending so much time away from my kids,\u201d Rowe said. \u201cWhen my mom was very sick, it was hard to be really present with them.\u201d\n\nCarol Abaya, a writer on aging issues, created a magazine called the Sandwich Generation in the 1990s. It happened after she suddenly felt pressure to take care of her parents at the same time she was running her public relations firm in the New York area. The publication offered advice and support to mid-life adults who felt stretched thin in their caregiver roles.\n\n\u201cWhen I looked around for help in dealing with my parents, there wasn\u2019t anything,\u201d Abaya said. \u201cBut there\u2019s been a big change. Today, there\u2019s more awareness of aging, chronic illness and the toll that it takes on society.\u201d\n\nIf caregivers change their lives to make more time, then the problem often becomes money.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s say the woman who was working quit work to take care of her elderly parent,\u201d Abaya said. \u201cLater in life, she has less money. You have a snowball effect. Everything snowballs to the next generation.\u201d\n\nSo what\u2019s a sandwicher to do? Experts say they should find and accept as much help as possible.\n\nRowe\u2019s mother died in December 2014 at age 76. Rowe said she could not have managed the dual caregiver role without the support of her wife, her friends and her mother-in-law, who watched her kids on the long, draining days when she took her mother to chemotherapy treatments.\n\n\u201cIt helped to come home and everyone there understood what I was going through,\u201d Rowe said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t have done it without my support network.\u201d\n\nPeople who are sandwiched need to take breaks. Otherwise, they become burned out and even sick themselves.\n\n\u201cCaregivers are notorious for not doing self-care. They feel guilty for not being there,\u201d said Anjana Chacko, a social worker who runs a pre-hospice program. \u201cHaving breaks and getting out and doing something fun for themselves is not frivolous. It\u2019s self-care. It\u2019s vital.\u201d\n\nChacko said one client of hers was recently stressed out from the intensity of caring for a loved one.\n\n\u201cShe says to me, \u2018I do get a break \u2014 I go to the dry cleaner and the grocery.\u2019 . . . I said, \u2018OK, we need to have a talk about what we consider a break.'\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://health.heraldtribune.com/files/2012/01/sandwich.jpg"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}}, "article_summary": "The term \u201csandwich generation\u201d was coined in the 1980s to describe people squeezed between taking care of children and parents.\nThe boomers\u2019 children, meanwhile, tended to have babies in their 30s and 40s, meaning that it\u2019s not uncommon to juggle young children and a mom or dad in need of care.\nNow, as members of the baby boom are entering their 70s, that sandwich is poised to become a footlong.\n\u201cWhen my mom was very sick, it was hard to be really present with them.\u201dCarol Abaya, a writer on aging issues, created a magazine called the Sandwich Generation in the 1990s.\nIt\u2019s vital.\u201dChacko said one client of hers was recently stressed out from the intensity of caring for a loved one."}
