First you\u2019re forced to buy government mandated health insurance then, because the insurers that collaborated with the President Obama to create the monster known as \u201cObamacare,\u201d want to reduce payouts, the government now wants to tell American\u2019s what they can eat and how much TV and computer time they can have.\n\nThink I\u2019m exaggerating? Think again.\n\nAccording to an article in The Washington Free Beacon, the federal committee responsible for nutrition guidelines, Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee (DGAC), is calling for the adoption of \u201cplant-based\u201d diets, taxes on dessert, trained obesity \u201cinterventionists\u201d at worksites, and electronic monitoring of how long Americans sit in front of the television.\n\nThe government will use the DGAC\u2019s far-reaching 571-pages of recommendations to to develop the 2015 Dietary Guidelines for Americans that are the basis for government food assistance programs, nutrition education efforts, and for making \u201cdecisions about national health objectives.\u201d\n\nThe DGAC wants \u201ctrained interventionists,\u201d inserted into schools, hospitals, work sites, restaraunts and public building to ensure people are eating what the committee believes are the right things. To discourage backsliding in private, the DGAC is calling for limiting peoples access to high calorie foods in public buildings, \u201climit the exposure\u201d of advertisements for junk food, a soda tax, and taxing high sugar and salt items and dessert.\n\nIn addition the DGAC is recommending \u201ccoaching or counseling sessions,\u201d \u201cpeer-based social support,\u201d and \u201celectronic tracking and monitoring of the use of screen-based technologies\u201d as a way to limit screen time. Yes, you read right, they want to tell everyone how much time they can spend in front of the TV.\n\nNow comes the recommendations that trod on my special area of expertise. The DGAC (climate experts all, I\u2019m sure), had the temerity to recommend Americans move towards plant based diets, not for health reasons, but to improve sustainability and reduce the threat of global warming.\n\nThere is no evidence, though there is much speculation and hype, that current diets in the developed countries are unsustainable (whatever that means). Only those wedded to the idea that the Earth\u2019s food system is a fixed pie, with limited slices, can one argue how we eat today is unsustainable. However, if you\u2019ve followed agricultural, technological and population trends over the centuries since Malthus first foisted upon us the idea that population would outstrip food supply, you\u2019ll recognize that the pie\u2019s size is not fixed, but ever growing. Why should people eat like their much poorer, less healthy ancestors once did? I know populations in developing countries want diets more like our own, and less like the ones they are currently restricted to by faulty economic and corrupt political systems.\n\nThe committee also said that \u201caltering individual and population dietary choices and patterns\u201d would be necessary to meet its sustainability goals, as well as policy changes.\n\nSadly, I am all to often reminded that the hubris of government planners know no bounds.\n\nAs the Beacon reports, outside of the communities of radical environmentalists and would be public health wardens, response to the DGAC guidelines have been negative.\n\nPer the Beacon:\n\n\u201cThe Committee\u2019s foray into the murky waters of sustainability is well beyond its scope and expertise. It\u2019s akin to having a dermatologist provide recommendations about cardiac care,\u201d Barry Carpenter, president and CEO of the North American Meat Institute, said in a statement.\n\nJeff Stier, a fellow with the National Center for Public Policy Research, said the report \u201cwas heavily influenced by activists\u2019 plans to change the nation\u2019s dietary guidelines to promote foods that they believe have \u2018a smaller carbon footprint.'\u201d\n\nThis country was founded on the ideal of individual freedom, not big-state nannyism, which is what has made it the envy of the world.\n\nI\u2019d like to leave my size 9 1/2 carbon footprint on the DGAC\u2019s members behinds.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://blog.heartland.org/2015/02/government-food-guidelines-reject-autonomy-independence/", "site_name": "Somewhat Reasonable", "image": "http://blog.heartland.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/diet-choice.jpg", "type": "activity", "title": "Government Food Guidelines Reject Autonomy, Independence"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdee20\"", "article_summary": "As the Beacon reports, outside of the communities of radical environmentalists and would be public health wardens, response to the DGAC guidelines have been negative.\nLeave it to Enviro-wackos to crawl into bed with public health scolds in order to restrict individual Americans freedom to eat as they choose.\nJeff Stier, a fellow with the National Center for Public Policy Research, said the report \u201cwas heavily influenced by activists\u2019 plans to change the nation\u2019s dietary guidelines to promote foods that they believe have \u2018a smaller carbon footprint.\nYes, you read right, they want to tell everyone how much time they can spend in front of the TV.\nOnly those wedded to the idea that the Earth\u2019s food system is a fixed pie, with limited slices, can one argue how we eat today is unsustainable."}
