After years of attempts, Walmart finally opened a story in Boulder in 2013. ( Paul Aiken / Daily Camera )\n\nAfter years of economic malaise stifling business activity, a slew of new developments moved forward in Boulder County in 2013, but, by the fall, historic flooding would have devastating effects on residents and communities.\n\nBelow is the Daily Camera's annual look back at the most significant business-related news events in Boulder and Broomfield counties during the past 12 months.\n\nSome potentially significant events -- including the ground-breaking of Boulder Junction, the potential revitalization of storied music studio Caribou Ranch and the progress on the Superior Town Center -- were not included on this year's list as their impacts most likely will be larger next year.\n\nNext week's Business Plus will highlight some companies and business-related storylines to watch in the coming year.\n\nFor now, we'll look back at 2013.\n\nWhen 2012 came to a close, key indicators started to signal that the local housing market was in recovery mode. Gains in home sales became steady, foreclosures found a bottom, rental markets tightened and new construction projects commenced.\n\nThe indicators proved true, and the combination of historically low interest rates, population influx, economic growth, low inventory and pent-up demand brewed a \"perfect storm\" in Boulder County's residential real estate industry. Multiple offers and fast, auction-like sales were commonplace in the sellers' market with some cities in the county posting double-digit increases.\n\nActivity picked up across all spectrums of the market, including the high-end. About 40 homes sold for more than $2 million, effectively doubling the luxury sales recorded in 2012.\n\nThis year also saw a wealth of new construction and proposed developments, including various multifamily projects in Boulder and a slew of residential projects in Erie.\n\nCome September, Boulder County homes and livelihoods were drastically affected by the historic rainfall and subsequent flooding that ensued.\n\nLegacy Real Estate Group broker and owner Garry Callis locks up a single family home while broker associate Lisa Henry looks on in Longmont earlier this year. The biggest story of the year in Boulder and Broomfield counties was the rebound of the housing market. (Matthew Jonas / Longmont Times-Call)\n\nThe flood destroyed 337 structures totaling $41 million in market value, according to the Boulder County Assessor's Office. Thousands more residences were damaged, with some residents having to take on the brunt of the economic losses.\n\nThe Boulder region's entrepreneurial spirit was handsomely rewarded in 2013.\n\nBoulder-bred firms Rally Software Corp. and Noodles & Company took to Wall Street with initial public offerings of $84 million and $96.4 million, respectively.\n\nOther established tech firms and startups landed in the hands of larger companies.\n\nAmong the largest deals: games maker Hasbro Inc. paid $112 million for a majority stake in Boulder's Backflip Studios, a mobile game developer; flash memory product developer Fusion-io bought Louisville's NexGen Storage for $119 million; and Seattle's F5 Networks shelled out $125 million for Louisville's LineRate Systems. The LineRate deal was said to be the region's largest networking buyout since HP acquired Lefthand Networks for $360 million in 2008.\n\nBoulder-area companies that were suitors in $100 million-plus deals included Clovis Oncology Inc., which paid $200 million in stock and cash to acquire the Italy-based Ethical Oncology Sciences, and WhiteWave Foods, which bought organic produce company Earthbound Farm for $600 million in cash. WhiteWave, which spun off from Dean Foods earlier this year, moved its official headquarters to Denver, but maintains its North American operations in Broomfield.\n\nWhile smaller in dollar value, two acquisitions in the outdoor retail industry had significant effects locally.\n\nTexas-based outdoor retail chain Backwoods bought Boulder's Neptune Mountaineering, which Gary Neptune opened in 1973; and the running division of Denver's Gart Cos. bought the Boulder Running Company.\n\n3.) Controversy ensues: Walmart arrives in Boulder\n\nDuring the past 20 years, discount giant Walmart made several attempts to open a large-format store in the city of Boulder.\n\nThose efforts ultimately failed as the retailer faced staunch opposition from some city leaders and residents.\n\nThis year, a Walmart opened in Boulder ... a Walmart grocery store.\n\nFrom left, U.S. Rep.

(LEWIS GEYER / Longmont Times-Call)\n\nAfter months of speculation and bits of evidence that Walmart was the operator of an unnamed grocery store in development at Diagonal Plaza, officials for the Bentonville, Ark.-based company in January confirmed that a Walmart Neighborhood Market would open at the northeast Boulder shopping center.\n\nThe 52,000-square-foot grocery store and the company behind it drew protests from a group of community activists.\n\nThe store ultimately opened in October and presented another competitor in an already crowded grocery market.\n\nSome more \"old Boulder\" fixtures closed their doors this year, with one of the most notable departures being the 100-year-old Eads News & Smoke Shop, which closed this summer.\n\nThe newsstand and tobacco shop in recent years had suffered declines in business because of the rise of digital media and stricter smoking regulations. Additionally, Eads' base of operations on the northwest corner of 28th Street and Canyon Boulevard was part of a property targeted for redevelopment.\n\nThat redevelopment -- a proposal that involves the building of two hotels -- also resulted in the departure of another longtime business: the Best Western Golden Buff Lodge. The motel closed in the fall after 56 years of business.\n\nThe year also marked the end for a spate of other Boulder businesses that have operated in the city for a quarter-century or more. Citing reasons from retirement to financial health, those businesses included Espresso Roma, Laudisio Italian Restaurant, Left Hand Books, Marie's Cafe, Swiss Chalet Timepieces and the Wendy's restaurant on 28th Street.\n\nThe year also brought operational changes for some of Boulder's longest-running businesses.\n\nThe Hotel Boulderado's Catacombs Bar, which has operated since 1969, is expected to undergo a significant remodel and a name and concept change in 2014.\n\nNearly 30 years after hosting its first Christmas shopping season, Longmont's Twin Peaks Mall will have its last this year.\n\nThe indoor mall that opened in 1985 is slated to be razed in 2014, and replaced by the Village at the Peaks, an open-air shopping center with nearly 500,000 square feet of retail space.\n\nShopping center operator NewMark Merrill Cos. bought Twin Peaks out of bankruptcy last year for $8.5 million. NewMark Merrill further unveiled plans -- and a new name -- for the redeveloped shopping center this year.\n\nNewMark Merrill and the city of Longmont have agreed to partner on the $80 million redevelopment that is expected to have Whole Foods, Sam's Club and Regal Entertainment Group as anchors.\n\nThe transition, however, has not been smooth. Throughout the year, the city of Longmont and NewMark Merrill wrangled with retailer Dillard's over the property it occupies.\n\nLast week, a court-appointed commission ruled that the Longmont Urban Renewal Authority would have to pay $6.3 million to acquire the Dillard's store. Once the purchase is made, the city and NewMark Merrill will be able to move forward on the redevelopment.\n\nThe passage of Colorado's Amendment 64 in 2012 added a curve to what had been an increasingly settled medical marijuana industry.\n\nThe amendment that allowed for the sale of recreational marijuana in Colorado to adults 21 years of age also gave cities and towns the ability to set their own regulations or determine whether to permit the operations.\n\nBoulder County municipalities scrambled to figure out how they would approach the new regulations, how existing dispensaries might be affected and how the new law would settle with residents.\n\nBoulder and Nederland moved forward on ordinances to govern retail marijuana shops.\n\nLouisville, which enacted a moratorium on new retail marijuana establishments until the end of 2014, also recently approved a set of regulations that limited the number and size of pot shops that could operate in the city. The ordinances also allowed for two existing dispensaries to expand and seek retail licenses.\n\nBoulder County commissioners ruled that existing marijuana businesses could apply for recreational marijuana retail licenses.\n\nOther cities such as Lafayette and Longmont have chosen to establish moratoriums as the state ironed out regulatory issues. Broomfield banned retail pot shops until 2015 and Superior, which banned medical marijuana dispensaries, voted to also prohibit pot shops.\n\nFive months after DigitalGlobe finalized its $453 million acquisition of competitor GeoEye, officials at the Longmont-based satellite imagery provider went before the Colorado Economic Development Commission and sought financial incentives.\n\nDigitalGlobe had plans to both increase its workforce -- by up to 505 jobs during the next five years -- and to build a new corporate campus. The latter move, officials said in May, could land the company's headquarters in Broomfield and Westminster.\n\nLongmont officials in July offered DigitalGlobe an $18 million incentive package of \"direct assistance and cost savings\" for a 10-year period, but a month later, DigitalGlobe officials announced plans to establish their headquarters in Broomfield.\n\nBroomfield, however, would get passed up as well. DigitalGlobe signed a 15-year lease for the 482,000-square-foot building at 1300 W. 120th Ave. in Westminster after property owner Avaya contacted the satellite imagery firm in September.\n\nDigitalGlobe plans to relocate most of its employees to the Westminster facility in mid-2015. Company officials said they plan to continue to have a presence in Longmont past 2015, but have not disclosed how many employees would be based there.\n\nDigitalGlobe employs more than 700 people at its facility at 1601 Dry Creek Drive in Longmont.\n\nWhen high-profile shootings prompted Colorado legislators to move forward on a bill prohibiting large-capacity ammunition magazines, Erie-based Magpul Industries countered.\n\nOfficials at Magpul, a manufacturer of high-capacity ammunition magazines, threatened they would move the 250-employee company out of Colorado if lawmakers moved forward on the bill. Such a move would negatively affect Colorado's economy and send a ripple effect throughout the state's plastics industry, Magpul said.\n\nAs it continued expressing a desire to leave the state, Magpul also upped its ante and launched a Cold War-themed campaign that involved making its PMAG ammunition magazines easily available to Colorado residents.\n\nThe threat gained national attention and residents of other states pleaded for Magpul to relocate its headquarters to their respective cities.\n\nBy April, Magpul officials posted on the company's Facebook page that some accessories, such as sights, were being manufactured outside Colorado's borders, but did not disclose where.\n\nBut by the fall, some Magpul customers grew increasingly concerned that the company wasn't following through on its promise. Officials told the Daily Camera that they had moved some operations from the state, but the relocation would take time because of both the logistics of moving to multiple new locations and the effects on existing employees.\n\nThe craft brewing industry contributed $1.6 million to Colorado's economy in 2012.\n\nIn 2013, Boulder and Broomfield counties' brew business continued to boom.\n\nA flurry of new craft breweries filled out the existing offerings in the city of Boulder and brought the industry to east Boulder County cities.\n\nIn all, a dozen breweries -- six of them in the city of Boulder -- opened in Boulder County during 2013.\n\nThe industry gains also resulted in some big moves for the Boulder-based Brewers Association, the trade association that represents the craft beer industry, provides research and information and puts on the annual Great American Beer Festival.\n\nThe Brewers Association, which has been based in a small west Pearl Street office for decades, announced that it planned to buy a building in downtown Boulder, where the organization intends to move its 50 employees.\n\nLate last year, Lucky's Market made some of the biggest moves since the locally owned grocery store opened in 2003 off Broadway and Quince Avenue in north Boulder.\n\nLucky's opened a neighboring bakery in north Boulder to accompany the existing grocery store and cafe. Lucky's also announced plans to open a grocery store in Longmont.\n\nIt turns out, there were more significant moves to come.\n\nLucky's quietly was starting to develop the concept into a small chain by opening Lucky's Markets in a smattering of towns across America's heartland.\n\nBo Sharon, Lucky's founder, confirmed the plans in January and, by the end of the year, Lucky's grew from one store to three with the addition of markets in Longmont and Columbus, Ohio.\n\nNext year, Lucky's plans to add stores in St. Louis, Billings, Mont., and Louisville, Ky.\n\nContact Camera Business Writer Alicia Wallace at 303-473-1332 or wallacea@dailycamera.com", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/boulder-business/ci_24773780/top-10-business-stories-2013-boulder-and-broomfield", "sailthru.author": "By Alicia Wallace \n \n  Camera Business Writer", "ag": {"canon": "BoulderDailyCamera:article:24773780:view"}, "startDate": "2013-12-22T16:42:14-0700", "twitter": {"domain": "dailycamera.com", "description": "After years of economic malaise stifling business activity, a slew of new developments moved forward in Boulder County in 2013, but, by the fall, historic flooding  would have devastating effects on residents and communities.", "title": "Top 10 business stories of 2013 in Boulder and Broomfield counties", "url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/boulder-business/ci_24773780/top-10-business-stories-2013-boulder-and-broomfield", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2013/1221/20131221__23dcbcov_TEST~1.jpg", "site": "@dailycamera", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "sailthru.section": "Boulder County Business", "modificationDate": "2013-12-23T07:40:18-0700", "endDate": "2023-12-21T17:12:11-0700", "news_keywords": "Boulder business news, Boulder Colorado, technology news, real estate, Boulder real estate, boulder business people, breaking business news, boulder, colorado, business, news,", "byline": "By Alicia WallaceCamera", "pubDate": "2013-12-22T16:46:26-0700", "sailthru.date": "2013-12-22T16:42:14-0700", "sailthru.title": "Top 10 business stories of 2013 in Boulder and Broomfield counties", "verify-v1": "TakAiHiDAOiNOP+m0YTx4DQeyjor+bTdc8e+pw6bDoI=", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2013/1221/20131221__23dcbcov_TEST~1_300.jpg", "description": "After years of economic malaise stifling business activity, a slew of new developments moved forward in Boulder County in 2013, but, by the fall, historic flooding  would have devastating effects on residents and communities.", "sailthru.site": "dailycamera.com", "msvalidate.01": "9DAB14005AD5A9FFA4CA0EF58CC794BA", "og": {"url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/boulder-business/ci_24773780/top-10-business-stories-2013-boulder-and-broomfield", "image": "http://extras.dailycamera.com/images/dailycamera3.png", "type": "article", "description": "After years of economic malaise stifling business activity, a slew of new developments moved forward in Boulder County in 2013, but, by the fall, historic flooding  would have devastating effects on residents and communities.", "title": "Top 10 business stories of 2013 in Boulder and Broomfield counties"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "867892b0357001538903740c75a206f0"}, "google-site-verification": "07CC1xPDVU0znu496XTAjLyC32Ylj8zwWHlmrzx3pgY", "y_key": "c9d9b53f7f5af674", "sailthru.image.full": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2013/1221/20131221__23dcbcov_TEST~1.jpg"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc8e8\"", "article_summary": "In all, a dozen breweries -- six of them in the city of Boulder -- opened in Boulder County during 2013.\nThe biggest story of the year in Boulder and Broomfield counties was the rebound of the housing market.\nIn 2013, Boulder and Broomfield counties' brew business continued to boom.\nBelow is the Daily Camera's annual look back at the most significant business-related news events in Boulder and Broomfield counties during the past 12 months.\nThis year, a Walmart opened in Boulder ... a Walmart grocery store."}
