The effects of this are still being felt today, both good and bad. For one, women have finally been recognized as worthy of holding the same basic rights as men in this country.\n\nHowever, many politicians will agree that the negatives far outweigh the positives. For one, it calls into question a state\u2019s right to decide its own laws. Who are we to tell a state what it can and can\u2019t do with its governing body? Many are calling this amendment a \u201cneedless overreach by the government\u201d in regards to civil rights.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s simply no need for [the 19th Amendment] anymore,\u201d said speaker of the House of Representatives, John Boehner. \u201cThat amendment was made out of necessity in a time when women were not afforded the same rights as men. But we don\u2019t need the government to hold our hand into a future of equality. We are there already.\u201d\n\nIn a somewhat shocking announcement by the new Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, the 19th Amendment is now on their list of things to repeal, right after the 57th attempt to get rid of Obamacare.\n\n\u201cThe federal government is causing more problems than it solves by sticking its hands into this suffrage business,\u201d McConnell said in a press conference. \u201cIt\u2019s costing millions in legal fees when states make reasonable attempts to deny women the right to vote and are taken to court. This Amendment is bankrupting the nation.\u201d\n\nStudies show that a majority of Americans (53%) believe that there\u2019s no need for promises from the White House that women can vote, according to a Fox News poll. It also points out that the so-called \u201cwage gap\u201d is just a scam by man-hating lesbians to get more government handouts. This and other \u201cwomen\u2019s issues\u201d are covered in-depth in Glenn Beck\u2019s upcoming book, \u201cThe Fictional War on Women.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis issue is one of the things that makes our nation great,\u201d Boehner said. \u201cThe problems that once plagued us, like sexism, racism, and corporate domination of American politics, are all things of the past. We don\u2019t need the government legally assuring everyone a right to breathe, just faith in the goodness of people. That alone should be enough of a reassurance for women that we will continue to allow you to vote.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"language": "en, sv", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Spur", "description": "In 1920, women\u2019s rights activists changed the political landscape of the nation when the 19th amendment was passed, guaranteeing women the right to vote.\u00a0 The effects of this are still being felt today, both good and bad.\u00a0 For one, women have finally been recognized as worthy of holding the same basic rights as men in\u2026", "title": "Republican Party to Repeal Women\u2019s Suffrage", "url": "http://www.smsuspur.net/commentary/satire/2014/12/04/republican-party-to-repeal-womens-suffrage/", "image": {"width": 658, "identifier": "http://www.smsuspur.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Sugar-Beet.jpeg", "height": 505}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"partner": "tfwp", "image": {"width": 658, "identifier": "http://www.smsuspur.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Sugar-Beet.jpeg", "height": 505}, "description": "In 1920, women\u2019s rights activists changed the political landscape of the nation when the 19th amendment was passed, guaranteeing women the right to vote.\u00a0 The effects of this are still being felt today, both good and bad.\u00a0 For one, women have finally been recognized as worthy of holding the same basic rights as men in\u2026", "card": "summary", "title": "Republican Party to Repeal Women\u2019s Suffrage"}, "robots": "follow, all", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "article": {"section": "Satire", "published_time": "2014-12-04T17:25:49+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-12-04T17:44:12+00:00", "author": "http://www.smsuspur.net/author/smsuspur/"}, "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,maximum-scale=1.0", "description": "Your University, Your News, Your Life"}, "article_summary": "Republican Party to Repeal Women\u2019s SuffrageExpect one of these to pop up in MarshallIn 1920, women\u2019s rights activists changed the political landscape of the nation when the 19th amendment was passed, guaranteeing women the right to vote.\nFor one, it calls into question a state\u2019s right to decide its own laws.\n\u201cThere\u2019s simply no need for [the 19th Amendment] anymore,\u201d said speaker of the House of Representatives, John Boehner.\nFor one, women have finally been recognized as worthy of holding the same basic rights as men in this country.\n\u201cIt\u2019s costing millions in legal fees when states make reasonable attempts to deny women the right to vote and are taken to court."}
