Their capture highlighted just one of several key problems in the Pentagon\u2019s plan to train so-called \u201cmoderate\u201d rebels.\n\nBut despite this early failure, Washington is pushing forward with its plan, and will soon send a group of fighters to push IS away from the Turkish border.\n\n\u201cAlthough there has been some skepticism about it, it is far too early to write off this program,\u201d a diplomatic source familiar with the program told Reuters. \u201cMassive resources have been invested in this to make it work and we think it will work in the end.\u201d\n\n\n\nofficial MintPress sponsor official MintPress sponsor\n\nIn many ways, that skepticism is valid. While the Pentagon initially hoped to train over 1,000 moderate fighters to combat the terrorist group in Syria, that number has dwindled considerably or the simple reason that the Pentagon is unable to find moderates.\n\n\u201cWe are trying to recruit and identify people who\u2026can be counted on\u2026to fight, to have the right mindset and ideology,\u201d US Defense Secretary Ashton Carter told the House Armed Services Committee in June.\n\n\u201cIt turns out to be very hard to identify people who meet both of those criteria.\u201d\n\nOthers noted that even if the plan were possible, it would take a decades-long commitment to achieve.\n\n\u201cThe project is very slow\u2026If it takes this long to train 60, it will take decades to get everyone ready,\u201d Capt. Ammar Wawi told the BBC earlier this month.\n\nThere were also concerns that arming and training rebel groups could result in inadvertently aiding terrorists. The Nusra Front\u2019s capture of fighters \u2013 and their equipment \u2013 seems to have proven those fears justified.\n\nBut the US and Turkey have a new plan to ensure that the new group proves more successful than the last: the two nations will provide air support.\n\nA deal was struck last month which allows the US to conduct air strikes against IS from Turkey\u2019s Incirlik Air Base. The first of those operations began earlier this month with a drone strike in northern Syria.\n\nBut as a number of US experts told Sputnik, air strikes may end up benefitting the Islamic State.\n\n\u201cSo in effect, Obama, by his orders, has fully aligned the US with the hardcore Salafist-backers in Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Turkey, to oust Assad and, ultimately, give ISIS [Islamic State] a beachhead on the eastern shore of the Mediterranean,\u201d said Jeff Steinberg, senior editor of the Executive Intelligence Review.\n\nThe second group of fighters is currently undergoing training in Turkey by instructors from the US British military. Deployment may come in a matter of weeks, and while the precise coordinates will depend on \u201cthe latest battlefield dynamics,\u201d according to the diplomatic source.\n\nWhile Turkey has refused to comment on the program, US agencies have only reaffirmed Washington\u2019s commitment to the plan.\n\n\u00a9 2015 Sputnik.
