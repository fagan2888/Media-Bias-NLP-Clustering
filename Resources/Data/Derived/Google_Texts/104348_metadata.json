Each kid's locker was outfitted with a helmet, jersey, and a personalized name plate. The tour ended with all of the kids \"swarming\" the field, and huddling up with players at the 50 yard-line.\n\nKid Captains are selected by both the Hawkeye Football team and University of Iowa Hospitals. They are all patients who face, or have faced, life-threatening illnesses.\n\n10 year-old Faith LeMaster of Ankeny, 11 year-old Marijka Mirchmershuizen of Pella, and 10 year-old Liam Feeley of West Des Moines will all represent Central Iowa as Kid Captains at Kinnick Stadium this season.\n\nLiam Feeley was born with thrombocytopenia-absentradius, a syndrome that left him without radius bones and kneecaps at birth. He couldn't stop smiliing on today's tour. Feeley was starstruck when he met his favorite player Mark Weisman, but that wasn't his favorite part.\n\n\"It's just awesome when you put it on,\" Liam says, talking about trying on the Hawkeye helmet placed above his locker.\n\nFeeley will be the Kid Captain for the Hawkeye's final home game against Nebraska on Friday, November 28th.\n\nYou can learn about all of the 2014 Kid Captains here.", "article_metadata": {"description": "IOWA CITY, IA-- A unique group of kids took the tour of a lifetime at Kinnick Stadium on\u00a0Saturday morning.
