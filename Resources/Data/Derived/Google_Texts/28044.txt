At least one thing is certain about the new health insurance marketplaces under the Affordable Care Act: consumers have a lot of questions.

My latest “Your Money” column covered many of the basics. This week, I’m answering readers’ questions. If you’re not sure how the law affects you and your family, e-mail your question to tsbernard@nytimes.com.

Q. Who can help me pick the right plan?

A. There are already reports of con artists trying to deceive consumers, so don’t trust just anyone. Trained navigators, application assisters and certified application counselors can help you with questions. They can be found through HealthCare.gov.

Insurance brokers and representatives can also help, but are not required to tell you all of your options, said Karen Pollitz, a senior fellow at the Kaiser Family Foundation.

Q. I haven’t seen a clear statement as to whether being on Cobra (from prior coverage on my ex-wife’s employer plan) will exclude me from the exchanges. Or, can I drop the Cobra plan if there’s a better deal on the exchange?

A. If you lose your job, you may be able to extend your employer-based health insurance for up to 18 months through Cobra. (But you often must pay the entire premium — that is, the share you paid when you were employed, plus your employer’s share.)

If you have Cobra coverage, you can keep it. But you also can go to the exchange. In addition, you may qualify for subsidized coverage. You can get exchange-based coverage as early as Jan. 1, as long as you enroll in a plan by Dec. 15.
