House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi says that members of her depleted ranks plan Tuesday to put forward a legislative package aimed at stopping corporations from organizing overseas for tax purposes and pushing CEOs to give their employees raises.

“In sharp contrast to Republicans whose first vote in the new Congress will be to advance additional tax cuts for the wealthy and special interests, we will bring forward the Stop Corporate Expatriation and Invest in America’s Infrastructure Act, which prevents U.S. corporations from renouncing their citizenship to dodge paying their fair share of taxes,” Mrs. Pelosi, California Democrat, wrote to her colleagues Monday.

Among other efforts, Congressional Republicans have indicated that they intend to pursue legislation authorizing construction of the Keystone XL Pipeline and making changes to Obamacare soon after the new Congress is sworn in this week.

Mrs. Pelosi also said Democrats will put forward legislation denying CEOs the ability to claim tax deductions on income of more than $1 million unless they give their employees a raise.

She went on to say that the GOP is “shutting down the debate for both Democrats and Republicans” on such issues with its rules package, and also asked for support when the full House votes to elect the speaker Tuesday. Despite some dissatisfaction from a small band of conservatives, Speaker John A. Boehner, Ohio Republican, is expected to be re-elected to the post.

“In all that we do in the Congress, we must keep the hopes, dreams, and aspirations of the American people at the forefront,” Mrs. Pelosi wrote. “We must all be committed to doing this in a bipartisan way. The New Year and the new Congress gives us a fresh opportunity.”
