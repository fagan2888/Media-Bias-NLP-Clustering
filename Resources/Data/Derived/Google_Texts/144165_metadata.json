Corso led the study, which was funded by Healthcare Georgia Foundation.\n\nThere are more than 90 of these charity clinics serving the uninsured across Georgia, the second-highest number among all states after Florida. Most of them are free to patients, but some charge a small fee.\n\nThe study also estimated that for every 100 patients that visit a GCCN clinic annually, $50,000 is saved in avoided visits to hospital emergency rooms.\n\nAnd for every $1 spent by these clinics on patients with hypertension, there is an estimated annual savings of $1.60.\n\nThis represents a savings of roughly $24,500 for every 100 patients treated or managed for hypertension in GCCN clinics.\n\nThe clinics \u201care a pretty efficient system,\u201d Corso said.\n\nHypertension, or high blood pressure, is fairly easy for researchers to track, both before and after visits, she said. \u201cHigh blood pressure, like all chronic diseases, is prevalent in Georgia.\u201d\n\nDonna Looper, executive director of the Georgia Charitable Care Network, told GHN this week that the study was conducted to pinpoint the savings provided by clinics\u2019 care. \u201cWe fill these gaps in care,\u2019\u2019 she said.\n\nPatient demand for clinic care statewide has remained about the same as it was before the full implementation of the Affordable Care Act, which brought more insurance coverage to Georgia.\n\nDemand \u201chas gone down in some areas and gone up in other areas,\u2019\u2019 Looper said. Two clinics have recently closed, in Savannah and in Gwinnett County in eastern metro Atlanta.\n\nAbout two-thirds of these clinics have a religious affiliation. \u201cThey\u2019re really committed to healing the sick,\u2019\u2019 Looper said.\n\nThe clinics are funded primarily through individual donations, though the Legislature also gave the clinics $500,000 in the current fiscal year budget.\n\nThe patients are predominantly adults from 19 to 64 who have no health insurance, she said.\n\nMany of these people have remained uninsured because Georgia has not expanded its Medicaid program, as outlined under the ACA. The state\u2019s political leadership has rejected expansion, citing the costs involved in the move.\n\nCorso said that in Georgia, \u201cthere\u2019s always going to be a place for free clinics.\u201d\n\nThe need for them will remain whether or not Georgia later does expand its Medicaid program, she added.\n\n\u201cEven in states that have expanded,\u201d Corso said, \u201cyou still see a significant number of uninsured.\u2019\u2019\n\nAnd if these people can\u2019t get needed treatment, she added, they wind up in the emergency room, the most expensive venue for basic medical care.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Athens News, Athens Georgia, Athens Banner Herald, Athens, Georgia, Georgia Bulldogs, Dawgs, Bulldogs, Music, UGA, newspaper, 30601, Clarke County, Madison, Oconee, Oglethorpe, Dogs, 30602, 30603, 30604, 30605, Richt, SEC football, Jackson County, R.E.M., Widespread Panic, B-52s, Local News, Andy Miller", "og": {"site_name": "Online Athens", "description": "Georgia's charity health clinics produce cost savings when treating patients with hypertension, a new University of Georgia study has found.", "title": "Charity clinics in Georgia save money, study finds", "url": "http://onlineathens.com/local-news/2015-11-12/charity-clinics-georgia-save-money-study-finds", "image": "http://onlineathens.com/sites/default/files/High%20Blood%20Pressure_Mora_0.jpg", "type": "article"}, "description": "OnlineAthens.com is the daily online edition of The Athens (GA) Banner-Herald."}, "article_summary": "ATLANTA | Georgia\u2019s charity health clinics produce cost savings when treating patients with hypertension, a new University of Georgia study has found.\nThere are more than 90 of these charity clinics serving the uninsured across Georgia, the second-highest number among all states after Florida.\nAnd for every $1 spent by these clinics on patients with hypertension, there is an estimated annual savings of $1.60.\nCorso led the study, which was funded by Healthcare Georgia Foundation.\nThe clinics are funded primarily through individual donations, though the Legislature also gave the clinics $500,000 in the current fiscal year budget."}
