In its letter, SEIU-UHW said it believes the CDIAC has the authority to pull together all parties and develop improved guidelines for disclosure by public and non-profit health systems.\n\nAlmost all disclosures fail to provide specific analysis as to how reform will affect the particular borrower, or identify steps the health system is taking to prepare for health care changes brought on by the Affordable Care Act and pending changes at the state level, the union said.\n\n\u201cProperly functioning credit markets are critical to our hospitals\u2019 success and we believe improved disclosure will help markets function more efficiently and ultimately improve the financial viability of our employers,\u201d said SEIU-UHW President Dave Regan. \u201cHealthcare reform is going to have a dramatic impact on healthcare consumers as well as employers and healthcare workers, and all parties need honest and accurate information to make decisions and determinations.\u201d\n\nAs a specific example of how disclosure is lacking and needs to be addressed, the union cited health system communications with the bond market regarding two SEIU-UHW-sponsored ballot measures that are on track to appear on the November 2014 ballot. The ballot measures are part of an effort by SEIU-UHW to lower healthcare costs and improve the health of Californians. The two ballot measures are:\n\nCharitable Hospital Executive Compensation Act of 2014 : Prohibits non-profit hospital executives in California from receiving more than $450,000 in annual compensation \u2013 the same amount received by the President of the United States. Many top executives in the state\u2019s non-profit hospitals make more than a million dollars a year.\n\n: Prohibits non-profit hospital executives in California from receiving more than $450,000 in annual compensation \u2013 the same amount received by the President of the United States. Many top executives in the state\u2019s non-profit hospitals make more than a million dollars a year. Fair Healthcare Pricing Act of 2014: Prohibits hospitals from charging more than 25 percent above the actual cost of providing patient care. On average, California hospitals charge 320 percent more than the actual cost of providing care in their facilities.\n\nThe California Hospital Association is claiming publicly that the Fair Healthcare Pricing Act would \u201cseverely harm\u201d its membership and cost hospitals about \u201c$12 billion a year\u201d (Modern Healthcare, Feb. 12, 2014). And a number of employers are claiming that hospitals will go bankrupt if the initiatives pass.\n\nHowever, SEIU-UHW has not found any hospitals or systems that have released disclosures to the bond market making similar claims of potential bankruptcy. Further, a number of health systems are going to the bond market and releasing new marketing materials that do not warn of any such extreme financial hardship.\n\nOne example is Sharp HealthCare, which filed its official statement for a $159.5 million bond offering on Jan. 23, 2014. The system notes the ballot measures as potential risks but does not warn municipal investors of anything approaching the scale or magnitude being claimed in press statements by the hospital industry.\n\nPaid for by Yes for a Healthy California, sponsored and major funding by Service Employees International Union, United Health Care Workers West.
