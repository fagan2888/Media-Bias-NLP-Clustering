FLOTUS advice for Bieber's parents\n\nFirst lady Michelle Obama\u2019s advice to Justin Bieber\u2019s mother is to spend lots of time with her son and get to know who he\u2019s hanging out with, the self-proclaimed \u201cmom-in-chief\u201d said in an interview released Friday.\n\n\u201cI would pull him close,\u201d Obama said of the 19-year-old pop singer in an interview with Univision, when asked how she\u2019d guide the troubled pop star right now if she were his mom. \u201cI don\u2019t know if it would be advice as much as action. I would be very present in his life right now. And I would be probably with him a good chunk of the time, just there to talk, to figure out what\u2019s going on in his head, to figure out who\u2019s in his life and who\u2019s not, you know.\u201d\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n( Also on POLITICO: Sen. Mark Warner not a Belieber)\n\nShe added that she\u2019s seen that her kids \u201cjust want you near, you know, they want that advice from a parent. They want to see you on a daily basis\u201d and because Bieber is \u201cstill a kid, he\u2019s still growing up,\u201d that lesson applies. The singer has faced multiple arrests, and reports of drug and alcohol use.\n\nWith Valentine\u2019s Day approaching, the first lady was also asked about how she and the president keep romance in their relationship.\n\n\u201cYeah, well, you gotta get creative,\u201d she said. \u201cBut, you know, our home is very private \u2014 you know, the residence where we live. I mean, it\u2019s not like we\u2019ve got people standing around over us every second of the day. But, you know, the president has to be as creative as any man out there needs to be at this time. But this year we\u2019ll probably low-key it in the White House. I just had a wonderful big birthday party and I, you know, I think he\u2019s done his part to show me how much he loves me so he\u2019s off the hook this year.\u201d\n\n( WATCH: White House will respond to Justin Bieber petition)\n\nObama also discussed the president\u2019s style, and said he\u2019s responsible for it. \u201cWe may criticize, laugh, joke, push, cajole, but in the end, you know, he\u2019s the one that\u2019s making the decisions about his look,\u201d she said.\n\nTurning to policy, the first lady pointed to continuing efforts to encourage some of the 10.2 million uninsured Latinos to sign up for health insurance under the Affordable Care Act. \u201cIt is so important now that health care is available at an affordable rate that folks in our communities access it,\u201d she said.\n\nObama was also asked about the constant scrutiny that she and her family face, and said that she\u2019s come to accept it.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: Rubio on Bieber: 'Dude is in trouble')\n\n\u201cYou know, that\u2019s just a part of public life. And, you know, our motto is that we do what we think is right. We stay prayerful,\u201d she said. \u201cYou know, we have probably just as many, if not more, people praying for our safety and \u2026 our strengths as we do any naysayers out there, so we focus on the positive and we\u2019re here to do a job, you know, and giving people access to affordable health care is one of those jobs.\u201d\n\nFollow @politico\n\nAuthors:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "\u201cI would pull him close,\u201d she says of the 19-year-old pop singer in an interview with Univision.", "title": "FLOTUS advice for Bieber's parents", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2014/02/michelle-obama-justin-bieber-103276.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2014/02/07/140207_michelle_obama_bieber_ap_605.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Justin Bieber,Michelle Obama", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "\u201cI would pull him close,\u201d she says of the 19-year-old pop singer in an interview with Univision.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd413b\"", "article_summary": "FLOTUS advice for Bieber's parentsFirst lady Michelle Obama\u2019s advice to Justin Bieber\u2019s mother is to spend lots of time with her son and get to know who he\u2019s hanging out with, the self-proclaimed \u201cmom-in-chief\u201d said in an interview released Friday.\n\u201cIt is so important now that health care is available at an affordable rate that folks in our communities access it,\u201d she said.\n\u201cWe may criticize, laugh, joke, push, cajole, but in the end, you know, he\u2019s the one that\u2019s making the decisions about his look,\u201d she said.\nI would be very present in his life right now.\n'I don\u2019t know if it would be advice as much as action,' Obama says of Bieber."}
