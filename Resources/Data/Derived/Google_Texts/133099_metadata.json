It's the notion that Longmont should be a standalone community with a buffer of open space between it and other municipalities. The motions passed during the March 31 regular city council session directed staff to:\n\n\u2022take action to acquire the parcel of land along Colo. 66 between Weld County Roads 3.5 and 5 utilizing open space dollars or other tools such as conservation easements or intergovernmental agreements (IGAs);\n\n\u2022prepare a policy discussion regarding how Longmont might prohibit leasing water to municipalities that would develop near Longmont's borders, especially between the eastern border and Interstate 25;\n\n\u2022engage, collaboratively whenever possible, Mead, Frederick, Firestone and other municipalities regarding the possibility of Longmont annexing or otherwise controlling development between Longmont's eastern border and I-25;\n\n\u2022prepare a report for the Longmont council on the status of the area in question which explains the foreseeable status of it and what possible actions the city could take to \"forward and protect Longmont's interests.\"\n\nMead and Longmont\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe third piece of the puzzle proved to be the most controversial, the only one of the motions to not pass unanimously, with council members Sarah Levison and Jeff Moore dissenting.\n\n\"I don't want to start a new and different kind of border war,\" Levison said at the time, adding later in the discussion \"I feel very uncomfortable with how this is going to be construed.\"\n\nIn the area Bagley referred to, Mead has annexed all sides of the I-25 and Colo. 66 intersection, but to the west of I-25, there are about seven parcels of land that lie in unincorporated Weld County.\n\nMead Town Manager Dan Dean said he had discussions recently with Longmont City Manager Harold Dominguez about the motion.\n\n\"We will approach it as we've always approached it. We had an IGA with Longmont for a number of years, and it was renewed for several years,\" Dean said. \"So at one time there was a consensus about where we were and where they are that seemed to work before.\"\n\nThe IGA between Longmont and Mead was agreed upon in 2008 for a term of five years, expiring in 2013. While a new one is in the works, staff has not yet brought it back to the Longmont council for approval.\n\nUnder that old IGA, Mead and Longmont agreed on boundaries on expansion. In short, north of Colo. 66, Longmont would remain west of East County Line Road and Mead would stay on the east side of the road. South of Colo. 66, Longmont was to stay generally west of WCR 5 and Mead would stay to the east.\n\nThe agreement said that neither Longmont nor Mead would get directly or indirectly involved in an annexation on the other municipality's side of the line, and if anyone on the opposite side tried to petition for annexation, each would refer the applicant to whichever city or town had dibs there.\n\nWhen asked for a general comment on Bagley's motions, Dean said he would prefer to hash it out over a renewed IGA.\n\n\"We've had IGAs with a number of communities where we agreed upon what was best for our communities jointly,\" Dean told the Times-Call. \"I preferred that approach rather than try it in the newspaper.\"\n\nLongmont and Firestone\n\nIn 2008, a dispute between Longmont and Firestone over a land next to the Union Reservoir open space metastasized into a two-year legal battle.\n\nLongmont preserved open space around Union Reservoir to serve as the city's eastern buffer. LifeBridge Christian Church planned to develop 350 acres just south of Union Reservoir and the City Council in August 2007 initially voted to annex the land into Longmont city limits, but a citizen-run petition forced the council to overturn that decision and put the project to a public vote. Before the January 2008 special election, the church withdrew its application with Longmont and started talks with Firestone.\n\nFirestone accepted applications from both LifeBridge and the owners of nearby 74-acre Firelight Park in 2008. The LifeBridge project, which was to include residential units as well as commercial space, grew when the church applied to Firestone for annexation. Longmont had approved 317 residential units while Firestone was willing to allow up to 1,623. Later that year, 60 percent of Firestone voters in a special election said they approved of the annexation on Longmont's border.\n\nLongmont, in response, filed competing, open-space annexations and then filed four lawsuits, saying that Firestone must stop annexing so the court could sort out the conflict.\n\nFirestone, in turn, filed four counterclaims and filed two of its own lawsuits. Eventually, after a Weld County District judge decided in Firestone's favor and awarded damages to Firestone, a post-election Longmont City Council voted to settle. Longmont agreed to pay $100,000 of Firestone's $220,000 legal bill that the town had passed on to LifeBridge and Fairview. Currently, Firestone town limits but up against the southeastern side of the Union Reservoir property.\n\nWhen asked for comment about the motions designed to keep Firestone at bay to the north of Union Reservoir but west of I-25, Firestone spokeswoman Kristi Ritter relayed the following written statement from Firestone Mayor Paul Sorensen.\n\n\"We fully respect the leadership of Longmont's right to build and develop their city in accordance with their community's goals and vision for the future. We hope they can afford Firestone, and all the communities across the Carbon Valley, the same respect. Firestone's approach to development has always been that we allow the market to decide where development will occur. When a proposed development fits within the plans for our growing community and the developer wants join Firestone (sic), we welcome that development. It's that simple. We will continue to pursue the values and vision created (sic) the quality of life and amenities that residents in our growing Town want.\"\n\nRitter said Firestone staff would not answer follow-up questions from the Times-Call on the matter.\n\nMead and Firestone\n\nAs the Longmont council gathers information on how to protect the eastern border, Mead and Firestone have been having squabbles of their own.\n\nIn 2014, Mead and Firestone attempted to annex overlapping segments of WCR 13 in unincorporated Weld County.\n\nFirestone wanted the road to lead to an eventual residential development in the area while Mead was trying to keep Firestone from creeping too close. After a series of disagreements in December, the two Weld County towns reached a settlement in which Firestone was able to annex the contested portion of WCR 13. It was not immediately clear what the town of Mead received in the settlement, according to Times-Call archives.\n\nKaren Antonacci: 303-684-5226, antonaccik@times-call.com or twitter.com/ktonacci", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.timescall.com/longmont-local-news/ci_27850293/longmont-mead-firestone-have-tangled-history-borders", "modificationDate": "2015-04-04T15:33:07-0600", "sailthru.section": "Local News", "sailthru.author": "By Karen Antonacci \n \n  Staff Writer", "description": "Longmont's eastern border was a discussion point in the City Council chambers long before Mayor Pro-Tem Brian Bagley successfully passed three motions last week designed to keep towns in southwest Weld County from coming too close.", "ag": {"canon": "LongmontTimes-Call:article:27850293:view"}, "startDate": "2015-04-04T15:31:13-0600", "og": {"url": "http://www.timescall.com/longmont-local-news/ci_27850293/longmont-mead-firestone-have-tangled-history-borders", "image": "http://local.timescall.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/1200x627/timescall.png", "type": "article", "description": "Longmont's eastern border was a discussion point in the City Council chambers long before Mayor Pro-Tem Brian Bagley successfully passed three motions last week designed to keep towns in southwest Weld County from coming too close.", "title": "Longmont, Mead, Firestone have tangled history of borders"}, "twitter": {"domain": "timescall.com", "description": "Longmont's eastern border was a discussion point in the City Council chambers long before Mayor Pro-Tem Brian Bagley successfully passed three motions last week designed to keep towns in southwest Weld County from coming too close.", "title": "Longmont, Mead, Firestone have tangled history of borders", "url": "http://www.timescall.com/longmont-local-news/ci_27850293/longmont-mead-firestone-have-tangled-history-borders", "image": "http://local.timescall.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/1200x627/timescall.png", "site": "@TimesCall", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-04-04T15:31:13-0600", "endDate": "2025-04-04T15:31:13-0600", "sailthru.title": "Longmont, Mead, Firestone have tangled history of borders", "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "byline": "By Karen AntonacciStaff", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "google-site-verification": "lLtD9ZooxmJUEEdRSCVzkO06t_hYKtyDqZF7EA3N2U0", "sailthru.site": "timescall.com", "pubDate": "2015-04-04T15:35:00-0600", "news_keywords": "Longmont Colorado TimesCall local news"}, "article_summary": "Mead Town Manager Dan Dean said he had discussions recently with Longmont City Manager Harold Dominguez about the motion.\nMead and FirestoneAs the Longmont council gathers information on how to protect the eastern border, Mead and Firestone have been having squabbles of their own.\nWhile a new one is in the works, staff has not yet brought it back to the Longmont council for approval.\nEventually, after a Weld County District judge decided in Firestone's favor and awarded damages to Firestone, a post-election Longmont City Council voted to settle.\nCurrently, Firestone town limits but up against the southeastern side of the Union Reservoir property."}
