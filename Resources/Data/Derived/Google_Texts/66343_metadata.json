Sam Brownback signed a school funding bill Wednesday that redistributes $83 million in aid for the state's 286 school districts for the next school year.\n\n\"Right now, we've put over half of our budget in K-12 and that's... one of the highest in America,\" said Brownback.\n\nThat law was in response to an earlier Supreme Court ruling that Kansas' education funding was unfair to poorer districts. Justices threatened to close state schools if lawmakers didn't address the problem by June 30.\n\nAlan Rupe, the school district's representative, says he plans to continue to fight the new bill, saying it doesn't fix the imbalance, but instead worsens the disparities and puts the districts even further apart.\n\nThe justices want attorneys to address whether the new law satisfies the earlier ruling, and what remedial action should be ordered if the court finds the new law is unconstitutional.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Kansas Supreme Court has scheduled oral arguments on whether a new education funding law is constitutional for early May 10.", "language": "english", "author": "AP; Greg Palmer", "og": {"url": "http://www.wibw.com/content/news/Oral-arguments-in-school-funding-case-set-for-May-10-The-Associated-Press-TOPEKA-Kan--TOPEKA-Kan-AP---375057211.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/school+funding+700.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "The Kansas Supreme Court has scheduled oral arguments on whether a new education funding law is constitutional for early May 10.", "title": "Oral arguments in school funding case set for May 10"}, "twitter": {"description": "The Kansas Supreme Court has scheduled oral arguments on whether a new education funding law is constitutional for early May 10.", "title": "Oral arguments in school funding case set for May 10", "url": "http://www.wibw.com/content/news/Oral-arguments-in-school-funding-case-set-for-May-10-The-Associated-Press-TOPEKA-Kan--TOPEKA-Kan-AP---375057211.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/school+funding+700.jpg", "creator": "@wibw", "site": "@wibw", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "keywords": "Oral arguments in school funding case set for May 10", "fb": {"app_id": 127891188221, "pages": 334421824439}, "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "google-site-verification": "xKK4ktPtBfFVLdzIx__cOn-VV5eDQAJ3ZPOJKffAg_I", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Oral arguments in school funding, case set for May 10"}, "article_summary": "Sam Brownback signed a school funding bill Wednesday that redistributes $83 million in aid for the state's 286 school districts for the next school year.\nThe Kansas Supreme Court has scheduled oral arguments on whether a new education funding law is constitutional for early May 10.\nThat law was in response to an earlier Supreme Court ruling that Kansas' education funding was unfair to poorer districts.\nAlan Rupe, the school district's representative, says he plans to continue to fight the new bill, saying it doesn't fix the imbalance, but instead worsens the disparities and puts the districts even further apart.\nThe court on Friday also ordered attorneys to file all briefs in the case by April 28."}
