In one of his syndicated columns with co-author Dr. Mike Roizen, the television host and cardiologist mentioned a particular product he recommends for treating hemorrhoids.\n\nIn the column, he said this:\n\nIf you need treatment, a device is coming to the market that makes getting rid of these much less painful: Ask your doc about HET bipolar ligator. (We helped develop this, and it\u2019s a major reducer of pain in the, well, you know what.)\n\nThe parenthetical statement at the end is an attempt at full disclosure and transparency, which is important, but it doesn\u2019t necessarily inform the public that he has made a profit. The Sunshine Law, part of the Affordable Care Act, requires every pharmaceutical and medical device company in the country to annually disclose payments made to doctors and teaching hospitals.\n\nAccording to the New England Journal of Medicine, a 2007 study found that 94 percent of American physicians had some kind of tie with industry. In the last five months of 2013 alone, medical device and drug companies paid American doctors $3.5 billion.\n\nBut some argue that mandated disclosure doesn\u2019t necessarily change the practice of drug promotion for profit. One study demonstrated how the law really hasn\u2019t changed the prescribing practices for some doctors in Maine and West Virginia.\n\nAnd in the British Medical Journal, doctors and editors pointed out how conflict of interest policies haven\u2019t been very effective. They wrote:\n\nJudges are expected to recuse themselves from hearing a case in which there are concerns that they could benefit financially from the outcome. Journalists are expected not to write stories on topics in which they have a financial conflict of interest. The problem, obviously, is that their objectivity might be compromised, either consciously or unconsciously, and there would be no easy way to know whether it had been\u2026 Doctors might wish it were otherwise, but none of us is immune to human nature.\n\nTechnically, what Dr. Oz did and the money he made is fine, but it just highlights the fact that transparency about involvement doesn\u2019t always inform the public about what that means in terms of profits. If it did, maybe some consumers would think at least a little bit more about products or drugs they choose to purchase or use.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Transparency about involvement with a particular drug or product is one thing for doctors, but would it make a difference if the public knew how much they were actually making in profits?", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "MedCity News", "description": "Transparency about involvement with a particular drug or product is one thing for doctors, but would it make a difference if the public knew how much they were actually making in profits?", "title": "Dr. Oz brought in $1.7M after promoting a hemorrhoid treatment in a column", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://medcitynews.com/wp-content/uploads/477709249-e1430486619985.jpg", "url": "http://medcitynews.com/2015/07/dr-oz-brought-in-1-7m-after-promoting-a-hemorrhoid-treatment-in-a-column/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://medcitynews.com/wp-content/uploads/477709249-e1430486619985.jpg", "description": "Transparency about involvement with a particular drug or product is one thing for doctors, but would it make a difference if the public knew how much they were actually making in profits?", "card": "summary", "title": "Dr. Oz made $1.7M for promoting product"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 148725768475669}, "google-site-verification": "xudQg7nxVR9ifmMTY4Tf-0wVtX9b6rWLQd0utCweGOc", "keywords": "weight loss, obesity, overweight,diabetes,massachusetts,medical devices,obesity,startups,healthcare innovation, medcity news,medcity news,san francisco, startups, life sciences,accelerator,rock health,startup advice,startup funding,patient monitoring system, motion sensors ,dc,healthcare it,washington,foodborne pathogens, diagnostics company, diagnostic platforms,minimally invasive surgery, laser surgery,cambridge,dealflow,hospitals,wellpoint, healthways, health and wellness, employee wellness programs,investing,wellness,medtronic, shanghai innovation center, china, r&d,china,mdt,minneapolis,minnesota,publics,twin cities,ulcerative colitis, abbott labs, humira,abbott labs,doctors,pharmaceuticals,skin disorders, pharmaceuticals, md anderson cancer center,cancer,texas,renal denervation, st. jude medical,st. jude medical,stj,emr, ehr, electronic health records, electronic medical records, certified emr,certified emr,ehr,electronic health records,electronic medical records,advanced cellular technology,amyotrophic lateral sclerosis,embryonic stem cells,geron corporation,lou gehrig\\'s disease,macular degeneration,regenerative medicine,spinal cord damage,value-based healthcare system, obamacare, fee-for-service model,california,cleveland,health insurance,insurance,ohio,pennsylvania,politics,cancer treatment options library, aetna, aet, healthcare it,aet,aetna,health it,phi,philadelphia,affordable care act, Dr. Mike Roizen, Dr. Oz, hemorrhoid treatment, The Sunshine Law, , MedCity News", "article": {"section": "Uncategorized", "tag": "The Sunshine Law", "published_time": "2015-07-27T13:39:26-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,width=device-width,user-scalable=no,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe024f\"", "article_summary": "Many doctors make a lot of money for promoting the use of particular prescription drugs and products, and Dr. Oz is one of them.\nIn the last five months of 2013 alone, medical device and drug companies paid American doctors $3.5 billion.\nAnd in the British Medical Journal, doctors and editors pointed out how conflict of interest policies haven\u2019t been very effective.\nIn one of his syndicated columns with co-author Dr. Mike Roizen, the television host and cardiologist mentioned a particular product he recommends for treating hemorrhoids.\nThe Sunshine Law, part of the Affordable Care Act, requires every pharmaceutical and medical device company in the country to annually disclose payments made to doctors and teaching hospitals."}
