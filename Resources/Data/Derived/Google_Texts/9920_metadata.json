Funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the new design aims to be a safer and more effective form of protection for women.\n\nCurrently, female condoms are just pouches placed into the vagina, capable of preventing both pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). They cost about $4 each, according to Planned Parenthood. Compared to latex or male condoms, female condoms cover the inside of the vagina to prevent sperm from entering the woman. But the Indiana University researchers believe there could be plenty of improvements in that area. Less than one percent of all condoms in the world are female condoms, \u201ceven though they put power in the women\u2019s hands,\u201d Debby Herbenick, an IU researcher working on the project, described in an infographic.\n\n\u201cFemale condoms are really in their infancy,\u201d Herbenick said in a press release. \u201cCurrent condoms are big and baggy and really don\u2019t match a female\u2019s anatomy.\u201d Herbenick, along with Frank Sadlo \u2014 founder of the condom company, TheyFit \u2014 are working together to create a female condom with a more elliptical shape, as opposed to a round one. This would make it fit better with the female body.\n\nThe condom project is one of 52 different projects funded by the foundation, as part of an initiative called Grand Challenges in Global Health that aims to improve health of people in third world countries. It\u2019s the first female condom project to be funded, though male condom designs had been funded in the past. Grants were also awarded to projects that would work on researching new ways to mitigate major diseases in developing countries, like sickle cell disease and HIV/AIDS, as well as improving birth outcomes.\n\n\u201cMany men just refuse to use condoms, so if a woman\u2019s partner refuses to use a condom or complains about a condom, she can say I\u2019ll use one,\u201d Herbenick said in the press release. \u201cIt provides a female-initiated or a female-controlled option.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "female condoms, condoms, sex", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Researchers out of Indiana University are working on designing a new female condom to help bring the power back into women\u2019s hands, especially in developing countries.", "title": "Researchers To Design New 'Elliptical' Female Condoms", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/new-elliptical-female-condoms-give-women-more-control-funded-bill-and-melinda-gates-foundation", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/04/female-condom.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Researchers out of Indiana University are working on designing a new female condom to help bring the power back into women\u2019s hands, especially in developing countries.", "title": "Researchers To Design New 'Elliptical' Female Condoms", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/new-elliptical-female-condoms-give-women-more-control-funded-bill-and-melinda-gates-foundation", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/04/female-condom.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/04/female-condom.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2014-06-04T14:34:21-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-06-04T14:34:19-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Researchers out of Indiana University are working on designing a new female condom to help bring the power back into women\u2019s hands, especially in developing countries."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8425\"", "article_summary": "Compared to latex or male condoms, female condoms cover the inside of the vagina to prevent sperm from entering the woman.\nIt\u2019s the first female condom project to be funded, though male condom designs had been funded in the past.\nCurrently, female condoms are just pouches placed into the vagina, capable of preventing both pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases (STDs).\nFunded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the new design aims to be a safer and more effective form of protection for women.\n\u201cFemale condoms are really in their infancy,\u201d Herbenick said in a press release."}
