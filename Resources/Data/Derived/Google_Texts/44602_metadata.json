We\u2019ve already heard from the Court, but we didn\u2019t get a decision. Instead, it dismissed the case as \u201cimprovidently granted.\u201d\n\nGet discounts on everyday products and services with your AARP Member Advantages.\n\nThat, in legal lingo, is known a\u201dDIG.\u201d Some would say it\u2019s merely a statement that the justices chose not to decide the case and probably never should have accepted the appeal. But Supreme Court junkies know the real scoop: It\u2019s egg on the Court\u2019s face. DIGs are rare because the justices are very, very careful about how they decide to hear cases. Think about it: If you were a Supreme Court justice, how would you feel about having to admit you made a mistake? That\u2019s what a DIG is; it\u2019s the Court admitting \u2013 albeit in one sentence and in sort of formal language \u2013 that it screwed up. Of course, the justices don\u2019t have to tell us just how they screwed up, and they won\u2019t.\n\nBut what does their mistake mean for Harvey Levin, the 61 year-old plaintiff in the case? Well, that\u2019s unclear. Normally, when the Court DIGs, the decision of the last appellate court stands. In Levin\u2019s case, that would be the opinion of the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals, where Levin won big; it held that he could still sue under the U.S. Constitution even if he lost under the ADEA. And the Supreme Court\u2019s DIG did not vacate, or cast aside, that ruling. Nevertheless, now Levin\u2019s case will have to go all the way back to the trial court and presumably go forward from there.\n\nFor the rest of older America, the DIG is a missed opportunity, as Dan Kohrman, a senior AARP attorney, commented last week. Now the Court won\u2019t have an opportunity to declare that Americans who are covered under the ADEA also have constitutional claims. For that we will have to wait for another, similar case to make its way to the nation\u2019s highest court \u2013 and that might be many years down the pike.\n\nAlso of Interest\n\nSee the AARP home page for deals, savings tips, trivia and more", "article_metadata": {"page_title": "blog", "twitter": {"description": "It was over before it began.
