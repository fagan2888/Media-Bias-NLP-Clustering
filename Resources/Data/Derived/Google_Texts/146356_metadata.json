Rand Paul, the man who will singlehandedly bring his party into the 21st century by referencing modern cultural touchstones like Pink Floyd, Domino\u2019s pizza and Monica Lewinsky. The narrative, pushed by Paul\u2019s office and accepted by bored, middle-aged members of the press, is that the 51-year-old libertarian is just what Republicans needs to win over millennial voters and reclaim the White House in 2016.\n\nTo be blunt: This is a stupid narrative and everyone who isn\u2019t being paid by the Republican Party to promote it needs to stop.\n\nBefore getting into why the idea of Millennial Man Rand Paul is nonsense, it\u2019s worth unpacking the argument. To be fair, it\u2019s a bit more sophisticated than what I\u2019ve described above. As Joe Gandelman put it in a deeply unpersuasive article for the Week, the curly-haired lover of liberty \u201chas appeal to millennials disillusioned by intrusive government surveillance and aggressive drone strikes,\u201d and that means he \u201ccould really boost his numbers in GOP contests if he\u2019s able to mobilize young voters\u2026\u201d This could \u201csnowball,\u201d Gandelman writes, so long as Paul can convince the kids that he\u2019s \u201ctruly a candidate of change,\u201d a proposition made all the more likely by the fact that \u201cPaul would be the first GOP nominee whose ideology is genuinely anchored in libertarianism, with positions that often can\u2019t be neatly categorized.\u201d\n\nPutting those last two assertions aside \u2014 I\u2019d say Barry Goldwater\u2019s ideology was quite clearly \u201canchored in libertarianism\u201d and that libertarian positions can, in fact, be \u201cneatly categorized\u201d as, well, libertarian \u2014 Gandelman\u2019s argument boils down to the following: Young people don\u2019t like the NSA and drones, so they might vote for Paul, who is also a skeptic of the post-9/11 national security paradigm. Yet while he\u2019s right that millennial voters are far less comfortable with spying and drone strikes than the rest of the electorate, Gandelman exaggerates the intensity of their disaffection.\n\nOn spying, for example, it\u2019s true that young voters are more concerned with civil liberties; but as a 2013 Washington Post poll found, 18- to 39-year-old Americans still think investigating terrorist threats is more important than preserving civil liberties, by a breakdown of 52 to 45 percent. On drone strikes, meanwhile, a 2013 Fox News poll finds the conventional wisdom to be even more out of touch: by a score of 65 to 32 percent, respondents under the age of 35 said they approve of the U.S. using drones to kill suspected terrorists on foreign soil. In fact, the only scenario for which a majority of the under-35 crowd disapproves of drone strikes is if the suspect is an American citizen and the strike takes place on U.S. soil. Even then, it\u2019s hardly a blowout, with 44 percent registering their approval.\n\nSo Gandelman\u2019s pretty wrong, any way you slice it. But a better argument for Paul\u2019s appealing to young voters is possible, and was indeed offered by Ross Kaminsky in the American Spectator. Instead of leaning so heavily on the assumption that kids these days hate Big Brother, Kaminsky notes that on issues where millennial voters really stick out from the rest \u2014 marriage equality and immigration reform \u2014 Paul has tried to \u201cthread the needle\u201d by adopting positions that are slightly more nuanced than the GOP norm. Paul\u2019s against same-sex marriage, yes, but he thinks it\u2019s an issue best \u201cleft to the states\u201d and has argued that a reform of the tax code, \u201cso it doesn\u2019t mention marriage,\u201d would save the country from having to \u201credefine what marriage is\u2026\u201d On immigration reform, too, Paul ultimately votes with the rest of his party, but does so while leaving some wiggle room for expanding the work visa program and legal immigration in general.\n\nBetter is a relative term, however. While it\u2019s true that Paul doesn\u2019t usually sound like an unreconstructed homophobe on the issue of gay marriage, it\u2019s also true that Paul has jokingly compared same-sex marriage to polygamy and bestiality, putting himself in the same company as that noted champion of individual rights, Rick Santorum. Moreover, while nuance is nice, the fact remains that Paul is, objectively, against marriage equality. Why would a millennial voter who cares about LGBTQ issues support the guy who opposes marriage equality, and compared same-sex partnerships to bestiality, over a candidate who doesn\u2019t do either of those things? Because nuance? Further, why would a millennial voter who wants to see immigration reform happen in this country support a candidate who doesn\u2019t? Because he\u2019s willing to accept immigrants as a source of labor, even if he doesn\u2019t think they deserve a path to citizenship? Because, again, nuance?", "article_metadata": {"description": "Republicans and pundits say Rand Paul could appeal to millennials in 2016.
