Arsenal dominated possession the rest of the way but couldn\u2019t break through until Coloccini inadvertently deflected Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain\u2019s shot into his own goal seven minutes into the second half. Arsenal has now collected seven points from four games - six of them away from home.\n\n\u201cWe were mature and intelligent and we played a little bit cautious but at the end of the day we won the game,\u201d Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger said.\n\nArsenal playmaker Mesut Ozil missed the game with a knee injury, and Wenger started with Theo Walcott up front and Olivier Giroud on the bench. Walcott wasted the best chance of the first half, though, when he missed the net from a few yards out after Tim Krul couldn\u2019t hold on to Alexis Sanchez\u2019s shot.\n\nWalcott was taken off for Giroud in the second half but the Frenchman was ineffective as well, and the team\u2019s inefficiency is likely to increase calls for another striker to be brought in before the end of the transfer window on Tuesday.\n\nNewcastle remains without a league win after four games under new manager Steve McClaren, with the only success coming in the League Cup.\n\nMitrovic has now picked up two bookings and a sending-off in his first five appearances for Newcastle.\n\n\u201cIt was harsh. It was more clumsy, he had his eye on the ball and kind of stood on his foot,\u201d McClaren said. \u201cAll we could do after that (red card) was show spirit and fight and discipline. They were magnificent in terms of that and what a fantastic crowd.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Arsenal relied on Fabricio Coloccini's own goal to win 1-0 at Newcastle despite the hosts playing most of the Premier League game with 10 men on Saturday.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Arsenal relied on Fabricio Coloccini\u2019s own goal to win 1-0 at Newcastle despite the hosts playing most of the Premier League game with 10 men on Saturday.", "title": "Arsenal relies on own goal to beat 10-man Newcastle in EPL", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/aug/29/arsenal-relies-on-own-goal-to-beat-10-man-newcastl/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/08/29/ed3b2f4ccbb37d26800f6a7067002f4e.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/08/29/ed3b2f4ccbb37d26800f6a7067002f4e.jpg", "description": "Arsenal relied on Fabricio Coloccini's own goal to win 1-0 at Newcastle despite the hosts playing most of the Premier League game with 10 men on Saturday.", "card": "summary", "title": "Arsenal relies on own goal to beat 10-man Newcastle in EPL"}, "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "article_summary": "NEWCASTLE, England (AP) - Arsenal relied on Fabricio Coloccini\u2019s own goal to win 1-0 at Newcastle despite the hosts playing most of the Premier League game with 10 men on Saturday.\nNewcastle remains without a league win after four games under new manager Steve McClaren, with the only success coming in the League Cup.\nArsenal dominated possession the rest of the way but couldn\u2019t break through until Coloccini inadvertently deflected Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain\u2019s shot into his own goal seven minutes into the second half.\n\u201cWe were mature and intelligent and we played a little bit cautious but at the end of the day we won the game,\u201d Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger said.\nArsenal has now collected seven points from four games - six of them away from home."}
