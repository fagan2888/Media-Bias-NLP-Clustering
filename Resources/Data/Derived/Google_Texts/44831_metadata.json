Year after year, they spearhead our recurring appearance on the Orange County Register list of \u2018Top Workplaces\n\nAlta Resources, a global provider of customer management business process outsourcing (BPO) for Fortune 500 brands, announced today that it plans to fill more than 2,500 jobs across its locations in Wisconsin, California, Florida and the Philippines. More than 700 of those jobs will be based at its Brea campus.\n\nA majority of the hiring is to support several health-insurance clients, which have seasonal ramp-ups that require additional staffing in preparation for the Annual Enrollment Period (AEP), November 2014 through February 2015. As more consumers become eligible for health-plan coverage under the Affordable Care Act (ACA), Alta Resources\u2019 health-insurance clients anticipate an increase in contact volumes during AEP. Alta Resources plays a strategically important role in assisting these clients with their year-round and seasonal needs, including servicing the increase in health-plan questions, leads and enrollment.\n\nThe seasonal positions range from full to part time, and the company noted that various regular full- and part-time roles are also available. Positions are immediate, and qualified applicants will start as soon as possible.\n\nLisa Schulze, vice president of human resources at Alta Resources, said, \u201cWe have core values that we call \u2018Guiding Principles.\u2019 We have seven of them.

We\u2019re looking for people who, in embodying our Guiding Principles, are eager to learn, excel and deliver defined results for our leading client brands.\u201d\n\nAvailable opportunities include customer care; inbound sales, including licensed health-insurance sales; and team leadership. Alta Resources offers a variety of advantages to job seekers: flexible schedules completely tailored to individuals\u2019 lifestyle, paid training, competitive pay, a team-based culture, skills development and advancement potential for high performers.\n\nThe company also pays for health-insurance sales licensing for qualified candidates; licensing will be for the specific state(s) a sales representative will service and is his/hers to retain for as long as the license is valid, meaning it can be reused in the future.\n\nSteve Seidl, managing director of Alta Resources\u2019 Brea location, added, \u201cOne of the biggest advantages of working here is our dynamic culture \u2014 a product of our people. Year after year, they spearhead our recurring appearance on the Orange County Register list of \u2018Top Workplaces.\u2019\u201d In 2013, Alta Resources\u2019 Brea campus ranked 13th in the \u201cMidsized Companies\u201d category and also received the Medallion Award for its work-life flexibility. The year 2013 was also the fifth-consecutive time that the company made the list of Orange County companies. The ranking is based on a third-party survey of nearly 60,000 employees across 1,000 area companies.\n\nTo fill the roles, the company is asking interested candidates to visit JoinAlta.com to search current openings, create a profile and apply.
