David Breemer\n\nPrincipal Attorney\n\nPacific Legal Foundation\n\njdb@pacificlegal.org\n\n(916) 419-7111\n\n\n\n\n\nNorth Carolina Supreme Court will hear PLF\u2019s Nies case\n\nTown of Emerald Isle took family\u2019s beach property without compensation\n\n\n\nTown of Emerald Isle, N.C.; April 15, 2016: The Supreme Court of North Carolina announced today that it will hear the important property rights case, Nies v. Town of Emerald Isle, in which Pacific Legal Foundation (PLF) represents an Emerald Isle couple who sued after the town imposed a 20-foot-wide government driving lane across their privately owned sandy beach property. The Town also enacted and applied a law allowing the public to park and drive on the couple\u2019s land upon paying a fee to the Town.\n\nDonor-supported PLF is a national public interest legal organization that defends limited government and property rights in courts across the country. PLF represents beachfront homeowners Greg and Diane Nies, free of charge, in challenging the Town government\u2019s unconstitutional seizure of their property rights. PLF, which is headquartered in Sacramento and maintains an Atlantic Center based in Florida, is representing the Nies along with Keith Anthony, Esq., and North Carolina\u2019s Morningstar Law Group.\n\n\n\nNorth Carolina\u2019s High Court accepted PLF\u2019s petition for review after an adverse ruling from a state court of appeal.\n\n\u201cThe state Supreme Court\u2019s announcement should be welcomed by everyone who values fundamental property rights,\u201d said PLF Principal Attorney J. David Breemer. \u201cThe issue here amounts to Property Rights 101: Government is not allowed to invade property for public use without compensation \u2014 and that goes for property at the beach as much as anywhere else.\u201d\n\nEmerald Isle officials created a government roadway across private beach land \u2014 and didn\u2019t pay the owners a dime in reimbursement\n\nThe Nies own a beachfront house, which they purchased in 2001, on a lot that includes all the sandy beach property from the mean high water mark, inland to the first line of dunes. PLF and the Nies are challenging the Town\u2019s takeover of the Nies\u2019 sandy beach property, for government and public use, without any compensation as required by the Constitution.\n\n\n\nSpecifically, through a 2010 ordinance, the Town has given itself an exclusive, 20-foot-wide driving lane across the Nies\u2019 sandy beach property. Town vehicles now cruise across the Nies\u2019 land at all times of the day, leaving deep ruts that destroy vegetation, make it difficult for the Nies to walk on the property, and endanger their grandchildren and others who come to visit.\n\n\n\nMoreover, a 2013 Town ordinance creates a toll road across the same area (and more) of the Nies\u2019 land, allowing the public to drive across it, from September to May, for a fee to the Town. Trucks and cars now tear through the Nies\u2019 sandy land, \u201chotdogging\u201d and leaving trash.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhen government creates a road on private property, the Fifth Amendment says the owners must be compensated,\u201d Breemer noted. \u201cEmerald Isle officials suggest this rule doesn\u2019t apply to them because beachfront property is different. But, as PLF will argue at the state Supreme Court, they are clearly wrong. The Constitution prohibits government confiscation, even along the shore.\u201d\n\nThe Town\u2019s \u201cpublic trust\u201d argument is all wet\n\nIn trying to justify failing to pay the Nies for taking over the use of their private beach property, the Town has come up with an inventive \u2014 and baseless \u2014 theory. It claims that title to all privately owned beachfront land between the dunes and the mean high water mark, including the Nies\u2019 land, is subject to an unwritten \u201cpublic trust\u201d easement that allows the Town to occupy that area without paying the owners.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe city\u2019s argument amounts to a license for a sweeping seizure of people\u2019s private property along the coast,\u201d said Breemer. \u201cIt permits the government to take over all private land seaward of the dunes right away. As time goes on, it could continue to grab more inland private property as erosion causes the dunes (and the alleged public trust easement) to migrate landward. It\u2019s a formula for seizing people\u2019s backyards first, and confiscating their beach houses later when they come to be on a dry sand area, and not giving them a red cent in return.\n\n\n\n\u201cBeyond being a shocking example of government disrespect for people\u2019s private property, the Town\u2019s arguments also happen to be legally unsupportable,\u201d stated Breemer. \u201cThe public trust doctrine has never been held to allow government to pick a slice of private land for its exclusive use. Rather, as defined by consistent case law, the doctrine applies only to state-owned tidelands that are seaward of the mean high water mark. The Town is trying to twist and stretch this doctrine to cover private land to which it has never applied.\n\n\n\n\u201cEmerald Isle officials can\u2019t evade the Fifth Amendment with fanciful distortions of the public trust doctrine,\u201d said Breemer. \u201cAs with any normal eminent domain action, if the local government wants to use the Nies\u2019 private property for a town or public road, the Nies must be paid. In America, government can\u2019t take our homes, our yards \u2014 or our privately owned beach land \u2014 for free.\u201d\n\nStatement by Greg Nies\n\nGreg Nies and his wife, Diane, are both retired from careers in data management. They have two grown children and two grandchildren. Retiring to their Emerald Isle beach home was a dream for them \u2014 until the Town took away their property rights.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe both worked hard all of our lives, starting as teenagers,\u201d said Greg. \u201cWe saved from our hard earned wages to buy this place, in 2001. After long careers working in offices all day, we wanted to retire to someplace that had good weather year-round and lots of opportunity to walk on the beach in the fresh air.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe felt it was our dream home,\u201d he noted. \u201cWe pay the mortgage and taxes. Yet it is now being taken away from us by the Town.\n\n\n\n\u201cSince the Town\u2019s creation of a government thoroughfare across our land, it is no longer the beautiful beach we fell in love with,\u201d he said. \u201cIt has become a rutted mess devoted more to vehicles than people. Trash trucks and other Town vehicles are driving by all the time. We worry about our grandchildren\u2019s safety due to Town approval of driving on our property. It is nearly impossible for us to walk on our own beach property due to the extreme ruts. Diane has had hip problems (sciatica). I have heart problems that have become quite serious now due to the stress of the Town taking of our property.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe understand the Town has the right to condemn for public use, but they have to pay market value,\u201d he continued. \u201cWe are grateful that Pacific Legal Foundation has joined us to fight for the basic property rights that we are being denied. In fact, we\u2019re fighting for everyone\u2019s property rights, because if government officials can make up reasons to take ours away, it can happen to other homeowners, wherever they live.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe case is Nies v.
