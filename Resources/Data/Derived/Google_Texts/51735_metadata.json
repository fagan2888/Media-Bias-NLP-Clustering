They\u2019re interesting. In the most recent Hot Air survey (conducted by Patrick Ishmael online at our famed sister website), Ted Cruz has catapulted himself into first place, gaining a burst of momentum after becoming the first Republican hopeful to officially announce he\u2019s running for president. Scott Walker and Marco Rubio took silver and bronze medals, respectively.\n\nAgain, as we\u2019ve intimated time and again, the results are fairly meaningless this early. But it is interesting that Ted Cruz received just 437 out of 1562 total votes cast in March (among a very conservative sample) the last time the poll was conducted. This week, however, he earned 668 out of 1782 total votes -- roughly a 10 percent improvement. That\u2019s a nice little bump for the junior senator from Texas.\n\nMarco Rubio, for his part, also got a bit of a boost, doubling the number of votes he earned between March and April from 95 to 191, respectively. Fellow Floridian and establishment favorite Jeb Bush didn't fare nearly as well, however: He finished with a grand total of 17 votes tallied in April -- one more than he received last month.\n\nBut at least he earned some support, right? We can\u2019t say the same for Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC). If the primary were today, not a single Hot Air reader would pull the lever for him. Not one.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t bode well for his forthcoming announcement, now does it?", "article_metadata": {"description": "Change..05/26/2016 7:04:56AM EST.", "author": "Daniel Doherty", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Change.", "title": "Daniel Doherty - Ted Cruz Wins New Hot Air Poll", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/danieldoherty/2015/04/22/ted-cruz-wins-new-hot-air-poll-n1988998", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015/91/9c101b38-fcde-45ce-9a4e-008d0905db1d.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Change.", "title": "Daniel Doherty - Ted Cruz Wins New Hot Air Poll", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/danieldoherty/2015/04/22/ted-cruz-wins-new-hot-air-poll-n1988998", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015/91/9c101b38-fcde-45ce-9a4e-008d0905db1d.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Ted Cruz Wins New Hot Air Poll, Daniel Doherty, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc16b\"", "article_summary": "But it is interesting that Ted Cruz received just 437 out of 1562 total votes cast in March (among a very conservative sample) the last time the poll was conducted.\nThis week, however, he earned 668 out of 1782 total votes -- roughly a 10 percent improvement.\nIf the primary were today, not a single Hot Air reader would pull the lever for him.\nIn the most recent Hot Air survey (conducted by Patrick Ishmael online at our famed sister website), Ted Cruz has catapulted himself into first place, gaining a burst of momentum after becoming the first Republican hopeful to officially announce he\u2019s running for president.\nAgain, as we\u2019ve intimated time and again, the results are fairly meaningless this early."}
