Nathan Deal is facing what we might call a classic political problem. He\u2019s mired in a toss-up reelection bid against Jason Carter, grandson of Jimmy. And his state now has the highest unemployment rate in the country. The probability of Jason Carter pointing out that Georgia has the highest unemployment rate in the country in verbal and televised attacks on Nathan Deal is quite high. This is not a good situation for Nathan Deal.\n\nA high unemployment rate isn\u2019t necessarily all it\u2019s cracked up to be, of course, and it doesn\u2019t reflect the clearest picture of an economy. Georgia may have an 8.1 percent unemployment rate, as calculated by the Labor Department, but a separate survey showed that \u201cGeorgia\u2019s rate rose even as its employers added the fourth-most jobs in the nation last month, gaining 15,800.\u201d As the AP explains, \u201cThe hiring and unemployment data can conflict because they come from two separate surveys. One is of households and the other survey covers businesses.\u201d The difference could also be explained by fluctuating in the size of the labor force. Point is: there are legitimate ways for Deal to explain away the top-line figure, to an extent, should he so choose.\n\nBut Deal instead has chosen to react to the number in the most hilarious and conspiratorial way possible, with one of the choicest quotes of the cycle: States with Republican governors have high unemployment rates while states with Democratic governors have lower ones? The Obama administration must be cooking the books!\n\nAt a public event Thursday, Deal described an inexplicable \u201cinfluence\u201d on the unemployment rate in Republican-led states. \u201cIt\u2019s ironic that in a year in which Republican governors are leading some of the states that are making the most progress, that they almost, without exception, are classified as having a bump in their unemployment rates,\u201d he said in a clip circulated by the Democratic Governors Association. \u201cWhereas states that are under Democrat governors\u2019 control, they are all showing that their unemployment rate has dropped. And I don\u2019t know how you account for that. Maybe there is some influence here that we don\u2019t know about.\u201d Asked to clarify the governor\u2019s remarks, a Deal spokeswoman pointed out that the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics had in previous years reported high unemployment rates in July and August only to revise them downward the following year. \u201cGiven the increase in jobs we\u2019ve seen this month, the BLS\u2019 pattern of downward revision and the drop in unemployment claims, the number doesn\u2019t make sense,\u201d said the spokeswoman, Jennifer Talaber. \u201cStates with Republican governors across the country are also seeing spikes in their unemployment rates.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Nathan Deal's state has the country's highest unemployment rate.
