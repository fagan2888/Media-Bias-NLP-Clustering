Michele Bachmann for her claim that Obamacare will literally kill women, children, and seniors.\n\nVideo:\n\nThe president was mocking his favorite Republican lies and quotes about Obamcare, when he called out a gem from Michele Bachmann. Obama said, \u201cI mean these are quotes. I am not making this stuff up. And here\u2019s one more that I\u2019ve heard. I like this one. We have to, and I am quoting here. We have to repeal this failure before it literally kills women, kills children, kills senior citizens. Now that I have to say that that one was from six months ago. I just want to point out that we still have women. We still have children, and we still have senior citizens.\u201d\n\nHere is the original video of Bachmann making her outrageous claim:\n\nSix months ago, Rep. Bachmann said, \u201cThe American people, especially vulnerable women, vulnerable children, vulnerable senior citizens, now get to pay more and get less. That\u2019s why we\u2019re here because we\u2019re saying let\u2019s repeal this failure before it literally kills women, kills children, kills senior citizens. Let\u2019s not do that! Let\u2019s love people, let\u2019s care about people. Let\u2019s repeal it now while we can.\u201d\n\nPresident Obama closed his remarks with a prediction that after Obamacare becomes popular, Republicans will start referring to it as the Affordable Care Act, and claim that they voted for it. It might seem like Bachmann is low hanging fruit, but when it comes to the ACA, she represents the mentality of the House and some Senate Republicans. These people will do and say anything to deceive the American people about healthcare reform.\n\nRep. Bachmann\u2019s claim was easily debunked. The Affordable Care Act has yet to kill a single woman, child, or senior citizen. The president did not name names as he quoted Republican Obamacare lies, but he didn\u2019t have to. His point was that these people are intentionally lying in order to deny tens of millions of people access to healthcare. At one point during today\u2019s speech, he directly called out Republicans for lying about the ACA.\n\nPresident Obama is confronting the lies, and showing America that the Republicans are wrong on healthcare reform. Their predictions of death panels, higher insurance rates, and mass unemployment are all wrong. None of this is happening. The ACA debate has matured to the point where supporters now have data and facts on their side. The impact of healthcare reform isn\u2019t a matter of subjective speculation anymore. The data is coming, and Republicans are being proven wrong.\n\nObama isn\u2019t tolerating the lies any longer. He totally destroyed Michele Bachmann, and her preposterous Obamacare misinformation.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Today in Maryland, President Obama mocked and ripped Rep.
