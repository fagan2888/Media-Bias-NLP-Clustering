Israeli drug maker Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. is in talks to combine with Allergan PLC’s big generic-drug business, in a move that would further consolidation in the health-care industry and likely mean the end of Teva’s pursuit of another acquisition.

A deal for the Allergan business, valued at about $45 billion, could be announced as early as Monday, according to people familiar with the matter. The Allergan AGN, -0.45% unit would be spun off and combined with Teva—already the world’s biggest seller of generic medicines with a market value of $60 billion—one of the people said.

Teva TEVA, -0.40% has been seeking to buy Mylan NV, MYL, +0.57% a deal Mylan has been resisting as it pursues fellow drug maker Perrigo Co. PLC PRGO, +0.32%

The merger would be the latest to shake up a major sector of the health-care industry, and come on the heels of two big announcements in which four of the largest managed-care companies—Anthem Inc. ANTM, +1.93% and Cigna Corp. CI, +3.60% and Aetna Inc. AET, +1.85% and Humana Inc. HUM, +2.30% —agreed to combine into two companies, in deals worth a combined $82 billion.

Companies of all stripes are scrambling for tie-ups following the Supreme Court’s decision last month that upheld the 2010 Affordable Care Act health-care overhaul. Teva and Allergan, one of the most active acquires in any industry in recent years, would be the latest example of companies consolidating in part to achieve the health savings sought by policy makers.

For Teva, a deal with Allergan would largely give the company what it has been seeking from a Mylan deal: increased scale in the hotly competitive generic-drug market, and an opportunity to pursue further cost reductions that could help it cope with razor-thin margins on the low-price medicines.
