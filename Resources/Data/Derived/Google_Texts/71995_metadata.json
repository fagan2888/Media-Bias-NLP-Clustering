David Petraeus, and turned her back on him.\n\nhttp://atlantaprogressivenews.com/2010/01/24/peace-activists-turns-backs-on-gen-petraeus-at-georgia-tech/\n\nLater that year, Benit helped create a fund for the family of Spc. Jamaal Addison\u2013the first Georgian killed in the U.S. Occupation of Iraq\u2013who was facing foreclosure.\n\nhttp://atlantaprogressivenews.com/2010/08/11/family-of-fallen-soldier-fights-foreclosure-with-help-from-activists/\n\nIn 2011, age 83 at the time, she was on the front lines of Occupy Atlanta movement. Atlanta Progressive News observed as Benit stood in front of a line of mounted police officers holding a sign that read \u201cSolidarity.\u201d\n\nOne mounted police officer told Benit and two others to get out of the street. Benit courageously did not move as the mounted police officer charged the horse toward her, stopping just one foot short of trampling her.\n\nhttp://atlantaprogressivenews.com/2011/11/07/apd-officers-run-motorcycle-into-protesters-charge-horse-at-senior/\n\n\u201cI love Doris. She was always on the right side of every issue,\u201d Gloria Tatum, Board Member and Senior News Writer for APN, said.\n\n\u201cWe were jail mates \u2013 we were best friends, we\u2019ve been close ever since, we\u2019ve been several places together,\u201d Ruffin, also a Grandmother for Peace for was arrested in the 2008 action, said.\n\n\u201cEven though she was sick [in recent months], she would still call the Governor to veto bills, she did a lot from home even when she couldn\u2019t come to the rallies,\u201d Ruffin said.\n\n\u201cShe treated me the same as she would treat anybody. Doris doesn\u2019t see race or color or whatever,\u201d Ruffin, who is Black, said.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t why she liked me but she seemed to like me and that made me like her more. She cared about the same issues that I did, the racial issues in this country. Even before Black Lives Matter, she wanted to deal with that,\u201d Ruffin said.\n\n\u201cShe hated the way Blacks are treated in this country, the way gays are treated, the way Hispanics are treated. She didn\u2019t like the way this State was trying to suppress the vote,\u201d Ruffin said.\n\nAtlantans would be surprised to learn that Benit started out as a Republican, a military wife, and a delegate to the Republican Party in Fairfax, Virginia, according to her daughter, Leslie Nelson. But, of course, this was decades ago.\n\nBenit had described herself as an \u201cEisenhower Republican,\u201d but changed when she said the party changed, and when it was revealed that the U.S. Invasion of Vietnam was a mistake of policy and fact.\n\nBenit worked in Washington, D.C., in the 1970s, after her political conversion. She worked as a caseworker for then-U.S. Sen. Joseph Montoya (D-NM). She moved to Kennesaw in approximately 2000 to be closer to her grandchildren.\n\nBenit is survived by two sisters, Mary Armstrong and Zora Furoy; one daughter, Leslie Nelson; and two grandchildren.\n\n(END/2016)", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.2.8", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "In 2009, Benit rallied in favor of single-payer health care, at a time when health care reform was being debated, prior to the enactment of Obamacare.\nTen Grandmothers for Peace were arrested, including Benit and two Board Members of Atlanta Progressive News.\n\u201cShe hated the way Blacks are treated in this country, the way gays are treated, the way Hispanics are treated.\nBenit focused not only on peace, in her opposition to U.S. invasions and occupations around the world; but on economic justice issues like health care and housing.\n(APN) ATLANTA \u2014 Doris Benit, 88, an activist and Grandmother for Peace, of Kennesaw, Georgia, passed away on, Wednesday, March 16, 2016, after spending time in hospice care in connection with heart issues."}
