Kevin Hagen for The Wall Street Journal\n\nUPDATED: Metro-North Railroad restored all service to and from Grand Central Terminal for the evening rush-hour after an explosion leveled two buildings in East Harlem, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority said.\n\nNew Haven and Harlem line service had been restored earlier Wednesday, while Hudson Line service was restored as tracks were reopened.\n\nThe MTA said that structural engineers from Metro-North had verified the integrity of the Park Avenue elevated structure, which runs near the site where two buildings collapsed in an apparent natural-gas explosion Wednesday morning. All four of the tracks on the structure were cleared of debris, inspected for track and third-rail integrity and approved for use by railroad and the city fire department, the MTA said.\n\nTrains will operate at slower speeds through the area of the collapse in an effort to protect employees and \u201creduce vibrations as rescue and recovery work continues,\u201d the MTA said in a release. Commuters should expect delays and crowding during rush hour.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "Metro-North Railroad restored all service to and from Grand Central Terminal for the evening rush-hour after an explosion leveled two buildings in East Harlem, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority said.", "title": "Metro-North Service Restored in Wake of East Harlem Explosion", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2014/03/12/alternative-train-service-plan-in-wake-of-east-harlem-explosion/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-BW628_nyexpl_P_20140312122835.jpg"}, "site": "WSJNY", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "New York", "article.headline": "Metro-North Service Restored in Wake of East Harlem Explosion", "description": "Metro-North Railroad restored all service to and from Grand Central Terminal for the evening rush-hour after an explosion leveled two buildings in East Harlem, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority said.", "article_section": "New York", "author": "Jennifer Maloney", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "Metropolis Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "Metropolis", "article.summary": "Metro-North Railroad restored all service to and from Grand Central Terminal for the evening rush-hour after an explosion leveled two buildings in East Harlem, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority said.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2014-03-12T16:30:34-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-161", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2014/03/12/alternative-train-service-plan-in-wake-of-east-harlem-explosion/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-METROB-20051", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "New York", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "Metro-North Railroad restored all service to and from Grand Central Terminal for the evening rush-hour after an explosion leveled two buildings in East Harlem, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority said.", "title": "Metro-North Service Restored in Wake of East Harlem Explosion", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2014/03/12/alternative-train-service-plan-in-wake-of-east-harlem-explosion/", "image": {"width": 749, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-BW628_nyexpl_P_20140312122835.jpg", "height": 499}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Metropolis", "article.id": "BL-METROB-20051", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2014-03-12T20:54:13-04:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb55a\"", "article_summary": "New Haven and Harlem line service had been restored earlier Wednesday, while Hudson Line service was restored as tracks were reopened.\nKevin Hagen for The Wall Street JournalUPDATED: Metro-North Railroad restored all service to and from Grand Central Terminal for the evening rush-hour after an explosion leveled two buildings in East Harlem, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority said.\nScene from building collapse and fire in East Harlem.\nThe MTA said that structural engineers from Metro-North had verified the integrity of the Park Avenue elevated structure, which runs near the site where two buildings collapsed in an apparent natural-gas explosion Wednesday morning.\nAll four of the tracks on the structure were cleared of debris, inspected for track and third-rail integrity and approved for use by railroad and the city fire department, the MTA said."}
