Christie has emphasized conservative credentials in the race for the Republican nomination. But at a campaign stop in Portsmouth, N.H., Tuesday, he heard from voters seeking a candidate who would stand up to the party on a variety of positions.\n\nAwaiting Christie at Popovers on the Square was Nancy Pierce of Rye, who began questioning the governor as soon as he shook her hand.\n\nOn the retired high-school principal\u2019s mind: the Republican Party\u2019s \u201cintolerance\u201d toward Muslims and others, Obamacare, women\u2019s rights, U.S. Supreme Court appointments, the prospect of \u201cboots on the ground\u201d in the Middle East.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not going to hear any intolerance from me,\u201d Christie said. As a former prosecutor, he said, he could \u201ctell the difference between a radical Islamic jihadist and someone who\u2019s a peace-loving Muslim. \u2026 We\u2019re going to continue to make that distinction.\u201d\n\nChristie told Pierce he\u2019d get rid of Obamacare, and would seek advice from justices like Samuel Alito to make court appointments.\n\nAs for women, \u201cI\u2019m a product of a very strong mom, and the husband of a very strong wife,\u201d Christie said. He said he wants his two daughters to know \u201ctheir sense of values and self worth comes from inside them.\u201d When Pierce asked about Roe v. Wade, he told her, \u201cI\u2019m opposed. I\u2019m pro-life.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe covered a lot of war front in a few minutes,\u201d Christie said.\n\nAfterward, Pierce said Christie\u2019s position on abortion was \u201ca problem\u201d for her. And she still had questions about how aggressive his military policy would be. \u201cI\u2019m nervous,\u201d she said.\n\nAn independent voter, Pierce hasn\u2019t voted in the Republican primary in years \u2013 but said she may do so this election, \u201cbecause I\u2019m so worried about (Donald) Trump and (Texas Sen. Ted) Cruz.\u201d She\u2019s considering Christie and Ohio Gov. John Kasich.\n\nChristie got pressed on climate change by Gary Doyle, 63, of Portsmouth, who handed the governor one paper on ice cores, and another linking climate change to instability in the Middle East. \u201cHaven\u2019t we talked before?\u201d Christie asked Doyle. \u201cGosh, you look familiar.\u201d (They hadn\u2019t, Doyle said.)\n\nDoyle, a former electrical engineer and registered independent, said he was \u201cvery disappointed with the general Republican denying\u201d of climate change, but plans to vote in the GOP primary.\n\nThe Democratic side is \u201cpretty much a done deal,\u201d Doyle said. Right now, he\u2019s stuck between Christie, Kasich and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush \u2013 looking for a \u201cstrong Republican who\u2019s going to act like an adult, and throw the Trump side of the party out in the dirt.\u201d\n\nAfter getting vetted on his positions, Christie met with a different demand. A young man in a Yankees sweatshirt, sitting at the back of the cafe, asked Christie to sign about a dozen photos, including one of Christie and Obama. The governor obliged, and the man got up and left with the photos \u2013 which he told a reporter he planned to sell on eBay.", "article_metadata": {"pubdate": 20160527, "editdate": "20151222T09:35:39", "twitter": {"title": "Independent voters press Christie in N.H.", "url": "http://www.philly.com/philly/blogs/christie_chronicles/Independent-voters-press-Christie-in-NH.html", "image": "http://media.philly.com/images/20151221-Chris-Christie.jpg", "creator": "@maddiehanna", "site": "@phillydotcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "cg": "news", "keywords": "Maddie Hanna", "description": "Gov.
