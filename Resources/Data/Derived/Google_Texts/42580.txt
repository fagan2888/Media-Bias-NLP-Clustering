The Wichita Force hockey team was filmed over the past week as part of a special feature airing during the Olympics.

Only eight sports teams across the world will be featured. The last part of the filming in Wichita happened on Sunday at a game where the Wichita Force and the Wichita Flying Monkeys played against each other. The Wichita Force is a team of law enforcement officers and the Flying Monkeys is a team of firefighters.

"It's kind of crazy that it is going to be national," said Ofelia Arrendon, who was attending the hockey match.

The film company, Moment Content Company, said the Wichita Force was selected because they felt it was a good team to highlight.

"We identified Wichita and we identified the Force as being the team that we would select," said Alessandra D'Avanzo of Moment Content Company.

An Olympic coach who has won gold medals in hockey was brought into teach the Force more techniques.

Danielle Sauvageau coached the Candaian woman's ice hockey team to win Gold at the Olympics in the 2002 and helped the Force..

"I came here, trained them for six days and then we played the game," said Sauvageau.

"We believed that we could win until the end and I'm pretty sure that they fire department through that they were going to lose," she added.

The Force lost the match in the last three seconds of play time, the score 2-3.

The featured film will be aired during the Olypmics on an online platform. The film crew is hopeful network TV stations pick up the features and broadcast it across the world.
