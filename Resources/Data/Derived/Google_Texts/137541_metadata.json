This has become extremely repetitive.\n\nNot that Vonn minds, of course.\n\nVonn completed a World Cup downhill sweep Saturday for her 17th victory at Lake Louise. The 31-year-old American star finished in 1 minute, 50.43 seconds to beat Switzerland\u2019s Fabienne Suter by 1.05 seconds. Austria\u2019s Cornelia Huetter was third, 1.16 seconds back.\n\n\u201cToday, I tried to limit my risk,\u201d Vonn said. \u201cBut at the same time my skis were so fast and the light was really flat and also it was a little more bumpy, that I was kind of hanging on for dear life.\n\n\u201cI felt like I was trying to be aggressive and trying to still ski solidly, but nothing was kind of going my way.\u201d\n\nSure didn\u2019t seem that way. Vonn has 14 downhill victories and three super-G wins at the Alberta resort. She has 69 overall World Cup victories.\n\nOn Sunday in the super-G, Vonn will try to finish off her third Lake Louise hat trick. She swept all three races in 2011 and 2012.\n\n\u201cI still don\u2019t think I\u2019m quite to the form that I was in 2012, the season that I won the four titles,\u201d she said. \u201cI was so confident in all disciplines. I feel like I\u2019m pretty confident right now but I think I could still be better, but I\u2019m still happy with where I am.\u201d\n\nVonn was smooth throughout her run, until she hit the bottom of the hill. She went over a jump and had to pump her arms to keep her balance. She landed on the backs of her skis.\n\n\u201cI was slightly worried for a second there that I was going to go out right before the finish, which I have done before,\u201d Vonn said. \u201cSo I\u2019m thankful that I was on the right side of the gate and made it to the finish.\u201d\n\nAll in a day\u2019s work for Vonn, who nearly wiped out the Friday but quickly recovered.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why I love what I do, because when you\u2019re in the starting gate it\u2019s you against the mountain and you can push yourself as hard as you want to,\u201d Vonn said. \u201cI still want to push as hard as I possibly can. That\u2019s what I love. I love the adrenaline. I love the speed. I love the thrill of it, and when the light\u2019s flat and it\u2019s bumpy it\u2019s that much more exciting for me.\n\n\u201cJust because I\u2019m older doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019ve lost any desire to continue to win and to continue to ski fast.\u201d\n\nVonn will have more company in the super-G on Sunday as Olympic and world slalom champion Mikaela Shiffrin makes her World Cup speed debut.\n\nAmerican Stacey Cook was 11th.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Lindsey Vonn wins again at Lake Louise", "title": "Lindsey Vonn wins again at Lake Louise", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/12/05/lindsey-vonn-wins-again-at-lake-louise/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151205__SKIWCupWomensDownhill3.jpg", "height": 421}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151205__SKIWCupWomensDownhill3.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-12-05T20:40:31+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-19T23:11:47+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "LAKE LOUISE, Alberta (AP) \u2014 Another race at Lake Louise and yet another win for Lindsey Vonn.\nVonn completed a World Cup downhill sweep Saturday for her 17th victory at Lake Louise.\nOn Sunday in the super-G, Vonn will try to finish off her third Lake Louise hat trick.\nShe has 69 overall World Cup victories.\nVonn has 14 downhill victories and three super-G wins at the Alberta resort."}
