Ricardo Lara (D) is pushing a bill through the statehouse that seems to promise the impossible: Making California the first state in the nation to allow undocumented immigrants to get covered under Obamacare.\n\nLara\u2019s bill \u2014 which was passed by the Senate last year \u2014 faces the state\u2019s Committee of Health on Tuesday. Policy experts say this bill has a good chance of landing on Gov. Jerry Brown\u2019s desk.\n\nThe bill represents a stepping stone toward allowing immigrants to purchase insurance through Obamacare\u2019s state health exchanges. Essentially, it asks the federal government to allow the state the right to open its exchange (Covered California, in California\u2019s case) to undocumented immigrants \u2014 which is currently illegal under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nWe are talking about our neighbors and our families who are denied basic health care in the richest state of this union\n\nAsking the government to change a major law may seem like a long shot, but this right is actually written into the ACA itself. The health care law welcomes \u201cinnovation waivers,\u201d or requests by state governments to modify the ACA in their state in order to expand insurance coverage. Lara\u2019s request falls directly into this category.\n\nTo Lara, the son of an undocumented immigrant, this bill isn\u2019t just about expansion.\n\n\u201cWe are talking about our friends. We are talking about our neighbors and our families who are denied basic health care in the richest state of this union,\u201d Lara said last June during Senate negotiations.\n\nTo gain state support, he\u2019s pointed to the ACA loophole allowing Medicaid to cover undocumented patients if they come through the emergency room. This means many immigrants rely on ER visits for health issues that could have easily been avoided with regular primary medical care \u2014 a luxury they aren\u2019t allowed. By expanding undocumented immigrants\u2019 access to insurance plans that cover preventative care, Lara said the government will see a significant decrease in spendy ER bills.\n\nER visits for undocumented immigrants add up to a yearly $1.7 billion in state costs, according to California Assemblyman Rob Bonta.\n\n\u201cWe are providing care in California at taxpayer cost for undocumented Californians today,\u201d he Bonta said, according to IB Times. \u201cThe emergency room is one of the most expensive points of healthcare delivery in the entire system. That\u2019s not efficient.\u201d\n\nLara has yet to request any state funding to back this bill. While this approach could help it land Gov. Brown\u2019s signature, opponents fear it also could render it pointless. To qualify for the ACA\u2019s \u201cinnovation waiver\u201d provision, a state cannot rely on any additional federal health care funding. That means that unlike documented immigrants, those without papers will have no access to the subsidies that make Covered California so affordable.\n\nIn a state where a staggering 80 percent of all households occupied by undocumented people live in poverty, the likelihood that they\u2019d opt into the unsubsidized exchange is slim. However, proponents say that this bill is just the first phase in California\u2019s push to give all residents access to affordable health care. This first stage may be more a symbol of progress toward this end goal.\n\nIf Lara\u2019s bill becomes law, California will be the first state to legally allow undocumented residents to purchase Obamacare plans. However, some states have already funded their own programs to break down the barriers to affordable health care. As of June 2015, 18 states offered subsidies for prenatal care for undocumented women and health insurance for all undocumented children.\n\nCounties in California and other states have introduced smaller-scale efforts to keep their communities healthy \u2014 and ER costs down. At least 20 of the 25 counties that host the largest percent of undocumented immigrants have county-funded programs providing free or subsidized preventative health care for undocumented people. In California, 48 counties offer this kind of care. County officials argue that this strengthens the entire health of the population.\n\n\u201cConsider the implications of half the people on the [local] rail lines and buses carrying them to work being denied flu shots,\u201d Clay Jenkins, the chief elected official for Dallas County, Texas, told the Wall Street Journal. \u201cThere are 2.5 million people that live here, and they\u2019re all important and they\u2019re all deserving of respect and medical care.\u201d\n\nThis post originally referred to California\u2019s state health exchange as Medi-Cal, when it is actually called Covered California.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "\"We are talking about our neighbors and our families who are denied basic health care in the richest state of this union.\"", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "\"We are talking about our neighbors and our families who are denied basic health care in the richest state of this union.\"", "title": "California May Become First State To Extend Obamacare Coverage To Undocumented Immigrants", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/health/2016/04/26/3772773/medical-coverage-undocumented-residents/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/26145420/AP_972855113342-600x315.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "\"We are talking about our neighbors and our families who are denied basic health care in the richest state of this union.\"", "creator": "@alex_zee", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/26145420/AP_972855113342-321x214.jpg", "title": "California May Become First State To Extend Obamacare Coverage To Undocumented Immigrants", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-health", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/26145420/AP_972855113342-540x303.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/26145420/AP_972855113342-99x66.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2016-04-26T14:56:14+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/alexzielinskireporter"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "ER visits for undocumented immigrants add up to a yearly $1.7 billion in state costs, according to California Assemblyman Rob Bonta.\nAt least 20 of the 25 counties that host the largest percent of undocumented immigrants have county-funded programs providing free or subsidized preventative health care for undocumented people.\nIf Lara\u2019s bill becomes law, California will be the first state to legally allow undocumented residents to purchase Obamacare plans.\nCalifornia Sen.
