More than 15 million Americans have gained coverage, costs are well below predictions, and employment growth has accelerated since the \u201cjob-killing\u201d law went into effect \u2014 but they know none of that, because all they hear from their preferred information sources is tales of disaster.\n\nSome things I\u2019ve been reading lately remind me that there\u2019s another major Obama initiative that is the subject of similar delusions: the promotion of green energy. Everyone on the right knows that the stimulus-linked efforts to promote solar and wind were a bust \u2014 Solyndra! Solyndra! Benghazi! \u2014 and in general they still seem to regard renewables as hippie-dippy stuff that will never go anywhere.\n\nSo it comes as something of a shock when you look at the actual data, and discover that solar and wind energy consumption has tripled under Obama.\n\nPhoto\n\nTrue, it started from a low base, but green energy is no longer a marginal factor \u2014 and with solar panels experiencing Moore\u2019s Law-type cost declines, we\u2019re looking at a real transformation looking forward.\n\nYou can argue about how much this transformation owes to federal policy. But only a combination of rigid preconceptions and sheer ignorance can explain the way right-wingers still go around sniggering about Obama\u2019s green-energy promotion. Far from being a bust, that policy was at least a contributing factor to an energy revolution.", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20150714175934, "BN": "krugman", "dfp-ad-unit-path": "opinion/krugman", "DISPLAYDATE": "July 14, 2015", "keywords": "Uncategorized", "communityAssetTaxonomy": "blogs/krugman/Invisible Green Triumphs ( 20150714 )", "PT": "Blogs", "SCG": "krugman", "sourceApp": "blogs", "twitter": {"description": "Another policy that failed to fail.", "title": "Invisible Green Triumphs", "url": "http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/07/14/invisible-green-triumphs/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "site": "@NytimesKrugman", "card": "summary"}, "adxPage": "blog.nytimes.com/krugman/post", "description": "Another policy that failed to fail.", "CG": "Opinion", "robots": "noodp", "dat": "July 14, 2015", "article": {"published_time": 1436911174, "author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/opinion/editorialsandoped/oped/columnists/paulkrugman/index.html", "section": "Opinion", "collection": "http://json8.nytimes.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "tag": "Uncategorized", "modified_time": "2015-07-14T21:59:34-04:00"}, "utime": 20150714215934, "communityAssetLabels": "NYT_Blogs", "PUD": 20150714, "pdate": 20150714, "thumbnail": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "og": {"site_name": "Paul Krugman Blog", "description": "Another policy that failed to fail.", "title": "Invisible Green Triumphs", "url": "http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/07/14/invisible-green-triumphs/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/blogs_v5/../icons/t_logo_291_black.png", "type": "article"}, "communityAssetURL": "http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/07/14/invisible-green-triumphs/", "PUV": "normal", "hdl": "Invisible Green Triumphs", "thumbnail_150": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "PST": "Blog Post"}, "article_summary": "Like a number of commentators, I\u2019ve been struck by how people on the right know, just know, that Obamacare has been a dismal failure.\nSome things I\u2019ve been reading lately remind me that there\u2019s another major Obama initiative that is the subject of similar delusions: the promotion of green energy.\nSo it comes as something of a shock when you look at the actual data, and discover that solar and wind energy consumption has tripled under Obama.\nPhotoTrue, it started from a low base, but green energy is no longer a marginal factor \u2014 and with solar panels experiencing Moore\u2019s Law-type cost declines, we\u2019re looking at a real transformation looking forward.\nEveryone on the right knows that the stimulus-linked efforts to promote solar and wind were a bust \u2014 Solyndra!"}
