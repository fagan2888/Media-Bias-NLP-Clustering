That means the government has hit only 18 percent of its stated goal of registering 2.7 million adults in the 18-to-34 age range.\n\nExperts have predicted that the program will need roughly 40 percent of enrollees to be in that prime demographic in order to be fiscally solvent. Adults ages 55 to 64 made up 33 percent of the total number of Americans who signed up, the largest group represented in the data.\n\nObamaCare needs so-called 'invincibles' -- healthy young adults -- to sign up in coming months to help offset the costs of older and less healthy enrollees. If that doesn\u2019t happen, insurers could be forced to raise the rates, making the costs and future of ObamaCare uncertain.\n\n\"This is concerning to us that we're seeing this portion come in so old,\" Marty Anderson, marketing director for Wisconsin-based Security Health Plan, told the Wall Street Journal.\n\nAllan Einboden, chief executive of Scott & White Health Plan, told the Journal that the data was \"more negative than we thought it was going to be,\" and added that several requests to pre-authorize surgeries for enrollees in the first days of their coverage had executives worried about costs.\n\nRobert Laszewski, a consultant who works with insurers, told The New York Times that \"You need healthy people of all ages ... the program is not ramping up fast enough to guarantee a good balance of healthy and sick people, which you need to sustain the program.\"\n\nAdministration officials, though, were upbeat in describing the numbers Monday. They said they're in a \"solid place,\" and noted that this age group makes up just 26 percent of the general population.\n\nMonday\u2019s report was the first time the government has released demographic data on the performance of President Obama\u2019s signature health care overhaul. In all, about 1.8 million people enrolled in new individual health plans through the law in December, bringing the total number of new enrollments between Oct. 1 and Dec.28 to about 2.2 million.\n\n\"There's no way to spin it: youth enrollment has been a bust so far,\" Brendan Buck, a spokesman for House Speaker John Boehner, said in a statement following the release. \"When they see that ObamaCare offers high costs for limited access to doctors \u2013 if the enrollment goes through at all \u2013 it's no surprise that young people aren't rushing to sign up.\"\n\nAs analysts have told Fox News, insurance companies have said they may want to take advantage of the \"risk pool\" provisions -- which involve the federal government covering 80 percent of any losses associated with an older and unhealthier base of customers.\n\nAccording to HHS, 79 percent of ObamaCare customers selected a plan with financial assistance. While only 2.2 million people have actually signed up, 44.5 million called or visited state and federal websites.\n\nOf the 2.2 million who have signed up, 54 percent are female and 46 percent are male, HHS said.\n\nIndividuals and families are able to choose from four plans offered through the federal marketplace -- bronze, silver, gold and platinum.\n\nSixty percent selected a silver plan, while 20 percent selected a bronze plan, according to HHS.", "article_metadata": {"classification": "/FOX NEWS/POLITICS/REGULATION/Health Care", "dcterms.modified": "2015-01-30 01:40:56 EST",
