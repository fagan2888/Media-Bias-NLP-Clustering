He said he saw his church and car blow up in front of him. He was shot by an AK-47 in his leg, he said, and his captors broke his teeth, nose, and back with a hammer.\n\n\u201cI still keep my shirt when they kidnapped me, and still I look to my blood every day, and I remember, and this is what happen[s] even to my people every day,\u201d he said.\n\nAl-Bazi was one of the speakers at a news conference Wednesday on a new report containing evidence of ISIS crimes against Christians that was submitted to the State Department.\n\n\u201cThe evidence contained in this report as well as the evidence relied upon by the European Parliament fully support\u2014and I suggest to you compel\u2014the conclusion that reasonable grounds exist to believe the crime of genocide has been committed against Christians in the region,\u201d Carl Anderson, CEO of the Knights of Columbus, said while presenting the report Thursday at a National Press Club news conference.\n\nThe report was co-sponsored by the Knights of Columbus, a Catholic society, and In Defense of Christians, a nonprofit organization dedicated to preserving Christianity in the Middle East\n\nThe 278-page report includes a legal brief; 44 Iraqi witness statements; and lists of crimes against Christians, Christians who were murdered, and churches that were attacked, as well as other supplementary materials.\n\nAnderson asked the United States to look to the European Parliament\u2019s recent decision to recognize ISIS\u2019 treatment of religious minorities\u2014including Christians\u2014as genocide and said an American declaration excluding Christians would be \u201ccontrary to the facts.\u201d\n\nNina Shea, director of the Center for Religious Freedom at the Hudson Institute, described an incident where a Christian woman witnessed ISIS crucifying her husband to the door of their home.\n\nYet, she said the State Department hesitates to include Christians in a formal declaration of genocide against ISIS because the department believes that ISIS views Christians as respected \u201cpeople of the book\u201d and offers Christians the opportunity to pay a tax.\n\nThe tax allegedly pays for protection and the right to worship, Shea said. But that\u2019s not respect, she added\u2014it\u2019s extortion.\n\n\u201cThe cloth of genocide is not lain overnight,\u201d Bishop Anba Angaelos of the Coptic Orthodox Church in the United Kingdom said at the news conference.\n\nThis has happened over decades. And what we\u2019ve seen is an ongoing persecution that has led to a desensitization that has led to a systematic acceptance of that diminished state as the status quo. And because it was the status quo, limits have been pushed, and we are where we are today.\n\n>>>Kerry Urged to Accuse ISIS of Genocide Against Christians\n\nJohnnie Moore, author of \u201cDefying ISIS: Preserving Christianity in the Place of Its Birth and in Your Own Backyard,\u201d also spoke at the report presentation. He said that earlier this month, Christian women had been handcuffed and shot for their faith.\n\nOver 200 House lawmakers have voiced their support of a declaration of genocide against ISIS for its treatment of Christians and other religious minorities through House Concurrent Resolution 75.\n\nThe resolution was introduced in September by Reps. Jeff Fortenberry R-Neb., and Anna Eshoo D-Calif., and defines targeted \u201catrocities\u201d against Christians and other religious minorities as \u201cwar crimes,\u201d \u201ccrimes against humanity,\u201d and \u201cgenocide.\u201d\n\nThe House Foreign Affairs Committee unanimously passed the resolution on March 2. In response, In Defense of Christians President Toufic Baaklini said in a statement:\n\n[In Defense of Christians] thanks the House Foreign Affairs Committee and the co-sponsors of H. Con. Res. 75 for calling ISIS\u2019 crimes by the rightful name, a statement that will resonate around the world, and urges the House leadership to bring this bill to a vote and the Obama administration and the State Department to officially recognize the genocide.\n\nSecretary of State John Kerry is expected to make a decision about a declaration of genocide by March 17.\n\nThis article has been corrected to reflect the true identify of al-Bazi\u2019s captors.", "article_metadata": {"description": "\u201cI still keep my shirt when they kidnapped me, and still I look to my blood every day,\" Father Douglas al-Bazi says.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "\u201cI still keep my shirt when they kidnapped me, and still I look to my blood every day,\" Father Douglas al-Bazi says.", "title": "ISIS\u2019 Crimes Against Christians Detailed in New Report", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/160310_ChristianGenocideReport_Mork.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-03-15T12:32:12+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1TTfTX7"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "\u201cI still keep my shirt when they kidnapped me, and still I look to my blood every day,\" Father Douglas al-Bazi says.", "creator": "@dailysignal", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/160310_ChristianGenocideReport_Mork.jpg"}, "title": "ISIS\u2019 Crimes Against Christians Detailed in New Report", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "International", "tag": "middle east", "published_time": "2016-03-11T15:49:22+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-03-15T12:32:12+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "ISIS, Genocide, Knights of Columbus, In Defense of Christians, State Department, John Kerry, Christians, House Concurrent Resolution 75, National Press Club, Middle East"}, "article_summary": "Al-Bazi was one of the speakers at a news conference Wednesday on a new report containing evidence of ISIS crimes against Christians that was submitted to the State Department.\nYet, she said the State Department hesitates to include Christians in a formal declaration of genocide against ISIS because the department believes that ISIS views Christians as respected \u201cpeople of the book\u201d and offers Christians the opportunity to pay a tax.\nThe report was co-sponsored by the Knights of Columbus, a Catholic society, and In Defense of Christians, a nonprofit organization dedicated to preserving Christianity in the Middle EastThe 278-page report includes a legal brief; 44 Iraqi witness statements; and lists of crimes against Christians, Christians who were murdered, and churches that were attacked, as well as other supplementary materials.\nOver 200 House lawmakers have voiced their support of a declaration of genocide against ISIS for its treatment of Christians and other religious minorities through House Concurrent Resolution 75.\n>>>Kerry Urged to Accuse ISIS of Genocide Against ChristiansJohnnie Moore, author of \u201cDefying ISIS: Preserving Christianity in the Place of Its Birth and in Your Own Backyard,\u201d also spoke at the report presentation."}
