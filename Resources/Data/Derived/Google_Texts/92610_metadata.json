While the WHA's report does not include costs or savings for specific hospitals, the 108 hospitals involved in the program cut surgical site infections (SSIs) by 37 percent between January 2012 and July 2013.\n\nReadmission reduction saw an even greater improvement, with the prevention of 3,556 readmissions saving hospitals $34 million. \"Readmissions account for one of the largest opportunities to drive unnecessary cost out of the healthcare system,\" the report states. \"An average readmission costs $9,600. Wisconsin hospitals have successfully reduced readmissions by 22 percent, exceeding the CMS goal of 20 percent.\" As a result, the report states, in the second year of readmission penalties, CMS will not penalize 63 percent of eligible Wisconsin hospitals and no hospital in the state will receive a penalty greater than 1 percent.\n\n\"When improvement work reduces hospital-associated infections and readmissions, it translates into cost savings, and that is a value for patients, employers and insurers,\" wrote WHA President Steve Brenton.\n\nIn addition to the positive news on readmissions and SSIs, the report states that:\n\nPatient falls are down 26 percent and care is safer for 176 patients, resulting in savings of $429,750 between 2012 and 2013;\n\nEarly elective deliveries are down 78 percent, improving safety for 291 infants and saving $211,922 between 2012 and 2013; and\n\nWisconsin is ranked third for average net incentive/penalty payments under Medicare's Value-Based Purchasing Program.\n\nReadmissions for Medicare patients are on the decline nationwide as well. After flatlining between 2007 and 2011, they fell to 18.4 percent in 2012 and below 18 percent in 2013, FierceHealthcare previously reported.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- read the report (.pdf)\n\nRelated Articles:\n\n20% of hospitals in six states have above-average readmissions\n\nReadmissions for Medicare patients fall for second year\n\nMedicare slaps two-thirds of US hospitals with readmission penalties\n\nMore losers than winners in Medicare's Value-Based Purchasing Program", "article_metadata": {"description": "Wisconsin hospitals cut healthcare costs by more than $45 million through a special project aimed at reducing\u00a0readmissions\u00a0and controlling surgery-related infections,\u00a0according to\u00a0a new report from the Wisconsin Hospital Association (WHA).", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "Wisconsin hospitals cut healthcare costs by more than $45 million through a special project aimed at reducing\u00a0readmissions\u00a0and controlling surgery-related infections,\u00a0according to\u00a0a new report from the Wisconsin Hospital Association (WHA).", "title": "Wisconsin hospitals reduce readmissions by 22 percent, save $34M", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/wisconsin-hospitals-reduce-readmissions-22-percent-save-34m/2014-01-21", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "Care Delivery,Patient Care & Outcomes,patient falls,Readmission Penalties,readmissions,surgical site infections,value-based purchasing", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Care Delivery,Patient Care & Outcomes"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf5c2\"", "article_summary": "Wisconsin hospitals have successfully reduced readmissions by 22 percent, exceeding the CMS goal of 20 percent.\"\n\"Readmissions account for one of the largest opportunities to drive unnecessary cost out of the healthcare system,\" the report states.\nWisconsin hospitals cut healthcare costs by more than $45 million through a special project aimed at reducing readmissions and controlling surgery-related infections, according to a new report from the Wisconsin Hospital Association (WHA).\nReadmission reduction saw an even greater improvement, with the prevention of 3,556 readmissions saving hospitals $34 million.\n\"An average readmission costs $9,600."}
