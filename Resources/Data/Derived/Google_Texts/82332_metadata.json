So that\u2019s what we\u2019ll try to do.\u201d\n\nThe loss to Kansas City in Week 4 last season was a tumultuous time for the Patriots, who were in the middle of what constitutes a slump for them: a pair of AFC championship game losses and a 10th straight year without a Super Bowl victory.\n\nNew Englanders began to wonder if quarterback Tom Brady, who was pulled from the game after throwing two interceptions, was slowing down at age 37.\n\nBelichick famously responded to all big-picture questions with a dismissive, \u201cWe\u2019re on to Cincinnati.\u201d\n\nAnd the Patriots did turn things around, winning 10 of their next 11 regular-season games and then earning their fourth Super Bowl title.\n\n\u201cA lot of time has passed there. So there are a lot of things to think about,\u201d Belichick said on Sunday.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been 25 games since then. A thousand plays on either side of the ball. There are some things we can take from it. There are some things that are outdated. \u2026 It has relevance.\u201d\n\nThe Patriots (12-4), who earned a first-round bye, will play the Chiefs in Foxborough, Massachusetts, on Saturday for the right to advance to the AFC championship game.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re doing a phenomenal job. Bill\u2019s a friend, he\u2019s a heck of a football coach. Tom Brady is unbelievable. And the job they\u2019ve done there, the accomplishments they\u2019ve had, they\u2019ve made history,\u201d Chiefs coach Andy Reid said. \u201cWe look forward to the challenge of playing them. That\u2019s what this is all about.\u201d\n\nBut while Belichick may be pondering that game against Kansas City a couple of years ago, Reid is hardly giving it a thought.\n\n\u201cListen, that was then, this is now, so you prepare yourself,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got guys playing now that were watching that on TV.\u201d\n\nNew England is trying to reach its fifth straight conference title game, but the Chiefs have a streak of their own.\n\nKansas City (12-5) has won 11 straight games, including the victory over the Texans. Belichick said on Sunday it will be harder to prepare for them because there are so few examples of things opponents did that worked.\n\n\u201cThe fact that they haven\u2019t lost in so long, it\u2019s not like you can go to a game and say \u2018This is how this team defeated them.\u2019 That just doesn\u2019t exist,\u201d Belichick said. \u201cSo we\u2019ve got to figure out a way.\u201d\n\nAP Sports Writer Dave Skretta in Kansas City, Mo., contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Bill Belichick: Surging Kansas City Chiefs hard to plan", "title": "Bill Belichick: Surging Kansas City Chiefs hard to plan", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/01/10/bill-belichick-surging-kansas-city-chiefs-hard-to-plan/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160110_112720_kansas-city-chiefs.jpg", "height": 484}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160110_112720_kansas-city-chiefs.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2016-01-10T10:40:24+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-18T21:17:21+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\u201cSo we\u2019ve got to figure out a way.\u201dAP Sports Writer Dave Skretta in Kansas City, Mo., contributed to this report.\nThere are two Kansas City games on Bill Belichick\u2019s mind right now.\n\u201cThat was a pretty dominant performance by Kansas City,\u201d Belichick told reporters on Sunday, a day after the Chiefs advanced by shutout to set up the second-round matchup.\nKansas City (12-5) has won 11 straight games, including the victory over the Texans.\nAnd the job they\u2019ve done there, the accomplishments they\u2019ve had, they\u2019ve made history,\u201d Chiefs coach Andy Reid said."}
