The ACA requires most employers with more than 50 employees to provide health insurance that covers preventive healthcare, including women\u2019s preventive care, without co-pays or deductibles. Under the regulations implementing the ACA, this includes a broad range of medical applications, such as cervical cancer screening and emergency contraception. With numerous federal courts divided on the constitutionality of the contraceptive mandate, and requests from parties on all sides of the debate to intervene, it was inevitable that the Court would take up this issue.\n\nIn determining the scope of women\u2019s preventive services to be included under the ACA\u2019s mandate, the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) engaged the Institute of Medicine (IOM) to examine the unique preventive needs of women. The IOM is an independent, nonprofit organization engaged by the government to provide unbiased, authoritative advice concerning healthcare matters. The IOM Committee, comprised of twelve women and four men, reviewed the evidence-based preventive services that are important to women\u2019s health and wellbeing, and then recommended which of these should be considered for coverage. The Committee recommended eight preventive services, including the full range of FDA-approved contraceptive methods.\n\nUnder the HHS implementing regulations, houses of worship are excluded from the requirement to provide contraceptive coverage. Religiously affiliated nonprofit organizations, such as colleges and hospitals, are not exempt but may avoid providing contraceptive coverage directly; instead, insurers are required to provide coverage directly to employees at no cost to employer or employee. From an actuarial perspective, contraceptive coverage is considered to be more cost-effective than spending for alternative health services and unintended pregnancies. Covered employers who fail to comply with the mandate are subject to substantial fines in the range of $100/employee per day. Several million employees are not included in the mandate, either due to their employers\u2019 religious affiliation, the size of their employer, or grandfathering provisions.\n\nThe Court accepted two cases, Sebelius v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc. and Conestoga Wood Specialties Corp. v. Sebelius. Hobby Lobby is a nationwide chain of about 500 forprofit arts and crafts stores, whose owners argue that the mandate is unconstitutional because it violates the fundamental tenets of its religious faith, which is integral to the operation of the business. Conestoga raises similar issues.\n\nAmong the questions the Court is likely to address are the following:\n\n(a) Neutrality. To determine whether the contraceptive mandate imposed under the ACA violates the Constitution\u2019s First Amendment, the Court must determine whether the mandate is one of general applicability that does not single out any one religion or religious practice, even if it happens to burden religious exercise. The Court held in a 1990 case, Employment Division v. Smith, that \u201cthe right of free exercise [of religion] does not relieve an individual of the obligation to comply with a \u2018valid and neutral law of general applicability on the ground that the law proscribes (or prescribes) conduct that his religion prescribes (or proscribes).'\u201d\n\n(b) Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 (RFRA). Congress passed RFRA to ensure robust First Amendment protection for free exercise of religion, in response to the perceived narrow interpretation of religious freedom in Smith. RFRA prohibits the federal government from imposing a \u201csubstantial burden\u201d on a person\u2019s \u201cexercise of religion.\u201d\n\nRFRA applies a two prong test: If a law imposes a substantial burden on religious practice, it must serve a compelling state interest and be implemented using least restrictive means. The government contends that promoting women\u2019s health and equality by means of affordable access to contraception is a compelling state interest, and that granting an exemption for religious employers satisfies the criterion of \u201cleast restrictive means.\u201d The government argues the burden on employers is \u201cslight\u201d and \u201cindirect.\u201d Finally, it cites the IOM report to conclude that the law advances a compelling state interest in avoiding unwanted pregnancies, improving maternal and child health, and reducing health care costs that lead to poverty.\n\nOpponents of the mandate deny the government can establish a \u201ccompelling\u201d interest by requiring employers to provide contraceptive coverage and thus creating a marginal increase in access to contraception. Opponents also deny that promotion of the public health is a compelling state interest in this case, suggesting that \u201cany such argument is undermined by the existence of numerous exceptions to the preventative care coverage,\u201d such as for houses of worship, grandfathering, and small employers. The argument has also been framed as a claim that the government is denying equal protection by imposing different rules for different employers.\n\n(c) Corporations, RFRA, and the First Amendment. Since the petitioners are corporations, the government argues that they are not entitled to assert a RFRA or First Amendment claim. RFRA specifically protects \u201ca person\u2019s exercise of religion\u201d and the government denies that corporate petitioners can be deemed \u201cperson[s] exercis[ing] religion\u201d pursuant to RFRA. Citing RFRA\u2019s legislative intent, the government argues that fundamental principles of corporate law require a distinction between the corporation\u2019s rights and responsibilities and those of its owners, and that the employers are not representatives of their employees.\n\nFinally, the government contends that First Amendment protection of religion is only intended for persons who possess a religious conscience \u2013 and not corporations. The government points out that the framers of the Constitution intended to protect unempowered minorities from religious burdens. It would be contrary to constitutional theory to allow corporations to use religious freedom as a means to oppress employees for whom they choose health insurance plans, many of whom to not share their religious convictions.\n\nCorporate petitioners argue that under Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission, corporations are considered people, at least for some First Amendment purposes. They argue that since religious organizations can create and govern themselves \u2013 and exercise freedom of religion vis a vis the contraceptive mandate \u2013 other corporations seeking to further religious objectives should not be denied equal protection of the laws merely because they are organized as forprofit corporations. Indeed, they point out that a corporation is simply an organization of people working together for common purpose.\n\n(d) Freedom of Speech and Expressive Association. Finally, opponents of the mandate argue that requiring organizations to provide contraception coverage is tantamount to obligating them to endorse the use of contraception, violating their freedom of speech and expressive association. In essence, they argue the law burdens both speech and free association by requiring petitioners to condone behavior they consider objectionable. In response, the government argues the mandate regulates conduct, not speech, and employers are free to disseminate literature explaining the mandate and their positions on contraception. The Supreme Court is thus likely to address whether the conduct of providing contraceptive coverage is inherently \u201cexpressive.\u201d\n\nOral arguments in these pivotal cases will not be heard until spring, and a decision is not likely until June.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://healthaffairs.org/blog/2013/12/27/the-contraceptive-mandate-public-health-versus-religious-freedom/", "site_name": "Health Affairs", "image": "http://healthaffairs.org/blog/wp-content/themes/HealthAffairs2015/images/facebook-default.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "The Contraceptive Mandate: Public Health Versus Religious Freedom"}, "description": "The Contraceptive Mandate: Public Health Versus Religious Freedom | At the intersection of health, health care, and policy.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "From an actuarial perspective, contraceptive coverage is considered to be more cost-effective than spending for alternative health services and unintended pregnancies.\nUnder the HHS implementing regulations, houses of worship are excluded from the requirement to provide contraceptive coverage.\nSeveral million employees are not included in the mandate, either due to their employers\u2019 religious affiliation, the size of their employer, or grandfathering provisions.\nIt would be contrary to constitutional theory to allow corporations to use religious freedom as a means to oppress employees for whom they choose health insurance plans, many of whom to not share their religious convictions.\n(c) Corporations, RFRA, and the First Amendment."}
