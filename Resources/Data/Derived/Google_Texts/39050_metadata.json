(Photo by Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg)\n\nIn the latest war over Obamacare, the GOP is essentially trying to encourage Americans everywhere to seek an exemption from the individual mandate, the health law provision that requires everyone to get insurance by March 31 or face a penalty.\n\nThe Obama administration says exemptions to the mandate are much more limited than the GOP and opponents of the law would have you believe.\n\nSeparately, the Republican-controlled House on Friday voted 238-131 in favor of bill that would delay the individual mandate until 2018. The impact of this legislation, which was tied to reform of Medicare physician reimbursements, would mean 13 million fewer people would have insurance in 2018 than if the mandate were kept in place, the Congressional Budget Office said this week.\n\nBehind these renewed attacks are the GOP's hatred of the mandate. The provision is indeed unpopular, but administration officials and insurers view it as a critical component of the law. Its main purpose is to prevent people from waiting until they\u2019re sick to sign up for insurance \u2013 a scenario that would drive up insurance costs for everyone else. Whether this will work is a separate question.\n\nThe twin attacks aren't surprising. The GOP has been trying to undermine the individual mandate from the moment Obamacare was signed into law. The vote in the House is of little consequence \u2013 it has almost no chance of passing the Senate.\n\nBut the GOP's exemption argument has the potential to be a little more disruptive. These exemptions are real \u2013 back in December, the administration spelled out 14 types. This week, the GOP has focused on two in particular.\n\nThe first one has to do with canceled plans. The administration said in December that anyone whose individual health plan was canceled last year wouldn\u2019t have to pay the penalty in 2014 if they remain uninsured. Those people also have the option of purchasing cheaper catastrophic plans. Just last week, the White House extended that exemption for another two years. The GOP said the White House tried to sneak through that latest exemption.\n\nThe other focus has been on a vague hardship exemption. People can avoid any penalties if they \u201cexperienced another hardship in obtaining health insurance.\u201d This language is pretty broad. And those who claim hardship don\u2019t have to provide documentation. So, doesn\u2019t this mean anyone can just claim hardship and avoid the penalty for not having insurance? The GOP is arguing as much.\n\nBut the administration says these exemptions are limited, and just applying for one doesn\u2019t guarantee you\u2019re going to get it. Each request is processed manually, and people could be asked to provide more information or be denied outright.\n\n\u201cThe Affordable Care Act requires people who can afford insurance to buy it, so that their medical bills are not passed onto the rest of us, which drives up health care costs for everyone,\u201d said HHS spokeswoman Joanne Peters. \u201cThis form, which was published last December, allows a limited number of individuals who are facing hardship to apply for an exception. This exception also makes it easier to find insurance by allowing those individuals to access catastrophic-level plans.\u201d\n\nWashington and Lee University law professor Tim Jost, a supporter of the health law, agrees that the exemptions are supposed to be limited. Still, he said the confusion over exemptions could create a problem.\n\n\u201cThe administration is opening itself up to having to deny a lot of frivolous claims,\u201d he said.\n\nBefore this latest flap, CMS had already predicted 12 million exemption applications would be filed by 2016. The administration hired Serco last summer to process this paperwork, but as HHS has not said how many have been filed or how many people at the company were reviewing applications.\n\nThe exemption battle aside, Jonathan Cohn of the New Republic writes that the administration never intended to enforce the mandate all that strictly in Obamacare\u2019s first year. He argues that a gradual approach makes sense in the rollout of a major program like this.\n\nStill, the administration has to deal with a weird balancing act. With the March 31 enrollment deadline approaching, the administration and states running their own health insurance exchanges are hoping the mandate can be an effective motivator for getting coverage. They don\u2019t want to make the mandate a focus of their enrollment push, but they\u2019re starting to incorporate it into their messaging more.\n\nLisa Sbrana, counsel for New York\u2019s exchange, said emails from the exchange this month are letting potential customers know they could face a tax penalty for skipping coverage. Kevin Counihan, the head of Connecticut\u2019s exchange, had set up a press call for Friday afternoon to raise mandate awareness. Minnesota\u2019s exchange started running commercials this week about the \u201crequirement\u201d to have insurance.\n\nOfficials are hoping that the message about the mandate can counter GOP efforts to undermine it.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The GOP argues that virtually anyone can be exempted, but the administration says the carve out is much more limited.", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "The GOP argues that virtually anyone can be exempted, but the administration says the carve out is much more limited.", "title": "Understanding the latest fight over the individual mandate", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2014/03/14/understanding-the-latest-fight-over-the-individual-mandate/", "image": "https://images.washingtonpost.com/?url=http://img.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/files/2013/11/wonk1111.jpg&w=1484&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@jasonmillman"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2014/03/14/understanding-the-latest-fight-over-the-individual-mandate/", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc51e\"", "article_summary": "HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius faced questions about the mandate exemptions this week.\nThe GOP has been trying to undermine the individual mandate from the moment Obamacare was signed into law.\nSeparately, the Republican-controlled House on Friday voted 238-131 in favor of bill that would delay the individual mandate until 2018.\nPeople can avoid any penalties if they \u201cexperienced another hardship in obtaining health insurance.\u201d This language is pretty broad.\nThe other focus has been on a vague hardship exemption."}
