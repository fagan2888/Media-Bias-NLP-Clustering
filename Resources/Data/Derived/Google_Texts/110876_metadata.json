It more resembles a crime family than a movement of ideas.\"\n\nShirley was commenting on the charge that the reason Congress has not gotten to the bottom of the IRS targeting of conservatives and Tea Party movement groups is because the establishment GOP wants the IRS to hobble these groups just as much or more than do the Democrats.\n\nThe notion that the Republican Party leadership is slow-walking the investigation of the IRS was first raised publicly by Democratic pollster and Fox News regular Pat Caddell.\n\n\"The establishment Republicans want the IRS to go after the Tea Parties,\" Caddell told Fox News on Sunday.\n\n\"When you have 71 percent who want an investigation, 64 percent who believe that it is a sign of corruption including nearly a majority of Democrats,\" Caddell said, \"the reason is the establishment Republicans want the IRS to go after the Tea Parties. Got it?\"\n\nAccording to Breitbart\u2019s Leahy, Caddell said the GOP establishment is happy to have the IRS take the Tea Party down a notch.\n\n\"Because the Tea Parties are an outside threat to their power hold and I'm telling you the lobbying consulting class of the Republican party and Republican leadership who have been attacking the Tea Parties, and alienating them, they want the IRS to do this,\" Caddell said.\n\nCaddell\u2019s comments echo remarks he made at CPAC last year in which he compared the inside the Beltway Republican consulting class to a RICO conspiracy. (The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act or RICO is the federal statute that prohibits criminal syndicates and conspiracies, such as the Mafia and drug cartels.)\n\nRush Limbaugh then waded into the fray by addressing the controversy during his Monday radio program remarking: \"That is a serious charge. That is a very, very serious charge that the Republican establishment is aligned with Obama and is okay with Obama using the IRS to investigate the Tea Party. But it's believable, because we know the Republican establishment, the political class in Washington, is spreading the word that they are not gonna criticize Hillary, it isn't gonna happen, and we shouldn't, either. It shouldn't happen.\"\n\nWe think Craig Shirley, Rush Limbaugh and Pat Caddell are on to something, but we wouldn\u2019t limit it to the IRS scandal.\n\nYou can go right down a long list of issues, starting with the IRS scandal, but including the failure to get to the bottom of the Benghazi attack, the establishment Republican Party \u201cleaders\u201d betrayal of conservative principles on spending and the debt ceiling, and the GOP\u2019s failure to use their full constitutional powers to carry the fight against Obamacare to a successful conclusion, and see the pattern.\n\nAnd the pattern is this: It doesn\u2019t matter which establishment Party is in power; the progressive inside \u201cleaders\u201d work together to grow government and make themselves and their friends rich in the process.\n\nCraig Shirley is right, such an intellectually bankrupt process does resemble a crime family a whole lot more than it does a movement of ideas.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "ConservativeHQ.com", "title": "Reagan Biographer Craig Shirley: GOP Resembles a Crime Family"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd29e9\"", "article_summary": "\"The establishment Republicans want the IRS to go after the Tea Parties,\" Caddell told Fox News on Sunday.\nCraig Shirley is right, such an intellectually bankrupt process does resemble a crime family a whole lot more than it does a movement of ideas.\nAccording to Breitbart\u2019s Leahy, Caddell said the GOP establishment is happy to have the IRS take the Tea Party down a notch.\nWe think Craig Shirley, Rush Limbaugh and Pat Caddell are on to something, but we wouldn\u2019t limit it to the IRS scandal.\nAnd the pattern is this: It doesn\u2019t matter which establishment Party is in power; the progressive inside \u201cleaders\u201d work together to grow government and make themselves and their friends rich in the process."}
