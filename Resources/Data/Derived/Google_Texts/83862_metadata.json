That\u2019s the philosophy of Bernard Tyson, the recently appointed CEO at Kaiser Permanente, one of the largest health-plan providers in the U.S. with more than 9 million customers.\n\nTyson said his chief role is to set clear expectations for leaders and trust them to be accountable. \u201cMy analogy is driving a car: the speed limit is 55 miles per hour. I tell my team, \u2018Listen, I can\u2019t be in the car with you every day. I have to trust that you know how to drive and can steer us in the direction we need to go.\u2019 \u201d\n\nBuilding an authentic culture means \u201cembedding the vision and mission of the organization in the hearts and minds of the people that carry it out,\u201d Tyson said. \u201cIt\u2019s not what we say that matters, but how we behave that drives our mission to provide access to quality care that is affordable.\u201d\n\nTyson touched on an issue of pressing concern within global organizations: Leadership credibility and the role it plays in driving employee engagement. Only 1 in 3 employees (34 percent) considers their managers to be effective leaders, according to a report by Development Dimensions International in Pittsburgh. Titled \u201cLessons for Leaders From the People Who Matter,\u201d it surveyed nearly 1,300 employees in 10 countries.\n\n\u201cMany employees think their leader is a jerk, and it affects their own performance. They aren\u2019t engaged and aren\u2019t giving their best,\u201d said Richard Wellins, a DDI senior vice president.\n\nIt\u2019s a lesson not lost on Tyson, 54, who succeeded George Halvorson as CEO in July, after serving as Kaiser\u2019s president and chief operating officer since 2010 \u2014 the year Congress passed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. \u201cIf my messages are inconsistent, over time employees will stop listening to me,\u201d Tyson said.\n\nLike the health care industry generally, Kaiser Permanente is bracing for a seismic shift in the U.S. health care system. The company reportedly sent cancellation notices to about 160,000 of its policyholders in California, part of an estimated 4.3 million people whose individual coverage was dropped by various insurers since the law took effect in October.\n\nDespite its rocky start, Kaiser Permanente officials say they generally support the new law. Specifically, the Oakland, California-based health care giant remains on the prowl for health care professionals to fill the hundreds of jobs it expects to create during the next several years.\n\nThe U.S. has added about 17,000 health care jobs per month in 2013, although the number slipped to 12,500 in October. Tyson said recruiting takes on a special significance, especially making sure new employees learn the values behind Kaiser\u2019s corporate vision and mission.\n\nA key component will be acclimating newly hired employees through \u201cstorytelling\u201d about Kaiser\u2019s history, with executives and front-line leaders using the anecdotes to shape Kaiser\u2019s culture. Most of the stories stem from the history of Henry J. Kaiser, the shipbuilding magnate who used his vast fortune to establish the Kaiser Family Foundation in 1948. Kaiser launched it in response to losing his mother at a young age due to lack of access to affordable health care.\n\n\u201cWe are fortunate to have this immense legacy of stories to draw on. As a leadership, Bernard expects us to use those stories to focus our mission and set the tone,\u201d said Chuck Columbus, a Kaiser senior vice president and human resources officer.\n\nRose Gailey, a consultant with consulting firm Gagen MacDonald, said senior leaders face a complex set of responsibilities compared to those in previous generations. In addition to setting strategy and organizational purpose, executives need to empower front-line leaders and unleash their potential.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why organizational stories are such a critical medium: Scripted messages don\u2019t get people to take ownership of a strategy. And execution requires people to have ownership,\u201d said Gailey.\n\nIn addition, Kaiser takes its \u201ccultural temperature\u201d through an annual employee survey that has a high rate of participation. Tyson said 84 percent of its 175,000 employees completed its most recent survey last year.\n\n\u201cPeople know we take it seriously and value their input,\u201d Tyson said.\n\nKnowing they\u2019re being heard also helps Kaiser burnish its reputation as a desirable employer, a key factor when trying to land top applicants in a crowded field, Tyson said.\n\n\u201cWe have a high percentage of employees who say they would highly recommend Kaiser as a great place to work and believe they make a difference in society. We think that\u2019s a pretty powerful message when we go out recruiting.\u201d\n\nGarry Kranz is a Workforce contributing editor. Comment below or email editors@workforce.com.
