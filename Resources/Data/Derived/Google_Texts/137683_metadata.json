John Fonfara and Rep. Patricia Widlitz, co-chairs of the Finance, Revenue, and Bonding Committee\n\nIn addition to trying to figure out how to deal with the changing landscape of how hospitals are managed and financed, the legislature\u2019s Finance, Revenue, and Bonding Committee heard testimony Thursday on a bill that would phase out the hospital tax over the next four fiscal years.\n\nSince 2000, hospitals were successful at fending off threats that the state would reinstitute a hospital tax, then came the $3.7 billion budget deficit that Gov. Dannel P. Malloy inherited when he took office in 2011 and all bets were off. Malloy was successful in getting lawmakers that year to approve his proposed budget, including a hospital user tax.\n\n\u201cWhen originally proposed, the hospital tax was levied to draw federal funds to help balance the state\u2019s budget,\u201d Frank Corvino, president and CEO of Greenwich Hospital, reminded the committee Thursday. \u201cThe taxes collected were returned to hospitals based on a formula that considered free and uncompensated care.\u201d\n\nBut things have changed.\n\nWhen the tax started it brought in an additional $200 million a year in federal revenue. That amount will be reduced to $40 million, Stephen Frayne, senior vice president of policy at the Connecticut Hospital Association, said.\n\nAlso, when the tax was imposed it was made with a number of promises, Frayne said.\n\n\u201cThe first is that it would be relatively painless. The second was that it wouldn\u2019t really cost anything. The third was that it would give the state an opportunity to tap unused federal funds that were available to the state of Connecticut,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said the state needs to take a look at how well it\u2019s kept those promises.\n\n\u201cThis past year hospitals let go 1,400 individuals, froze pay, eliminated benefits and had to retreat in many instances from commitments to expand and maintain and improve services in their community,\u201d Frayne said. \u201cCertainly, it was not painless.\u201d\n\nHe said every individual who gets their insurance through their employer is paying $49 more per person than they otherwise would have been paying if this tax wasn\u2019t in place.\n\n\u201cThat amount is going to double in three-and-a-half short months,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat we\u2019re looking at from you is to see if there\u2019s an opportunity to mitigate some of that tax.\u201d\n\nFrayne said what the bill does is not eliminate the increase in that tax, but instead of doubling it would only go up by 50 percent. Then it would reduce the tax in future years.\n\n\u201cWe believe it\u2019s high time this tax goes away,\u201d Frayne said.\n\nEbony Forand, a nurse supervisor at Johnson Memorial Hospital, works the overnight shift but, because \u201cit\u2019s that important,\u201d she stayed up to testify in favor of the legislation Thursday morning.\n\n\u201cConnecticut\u2019s hospitals have done extraordinary things to minimize the impact on patient care, but the negative effects of these revenue losses are increasingly real,\u201d Forand said.\n\nForand said her hospital had to lay off 22 full-time equivalent employees, reduce community services by 50 percent, and eliminate a wage increase.\n\nOffice of Policy and Management Secretary Ben Barnes didn\u2019t make it a centerpiece of his testimony, but he did urge the committee to reject the proposal. He said if enacted, the bill would result in an estimated $75 million revenue loss to the state in 2015. The revenue loss would grow to approximately $360 million by 2019.\n\nEarlier this week in an email, Barnes said it \u201cis very unlikely that the state will forgo other priorities, like universal pre-kindergarten, community mental health services, etc., in order to reduce the provider tax in 2015.\u201d\n\nHe said he hospitals are exaggerating the increase that is set to take place on July 1. He said the tax remains stable. The concern is about the reduction in federal funds for uncompensated care, which will be reduced because more patients are expected to have insurance under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nMichele Sharp, director of communications for the Connecticut Hospital Association, disagreed with Barnes\u2019 assessment of the situation.\n\n\u201cThe tax on hospital patients will rise from $101 million to $235 million in July,\u201d Sharp said. \u201cCHA\u2019s concern is the tax on hospital patients \u2014 it is impacting jobs and the ability of hospitals to invest in providing the best care to patients, and it is raising the cost of care for the people of Connecticut.\u201d\n\nBarnes said hospitals had $356.5 million in operating income, and $564.5 million in total income over expenses in 2012.\n\n\u201cIf hospitals are concerned that their margins are shrinking, they should look to their high-cost areas of spending,\u201d Barnes said.\n\nBut Tim Bolton, a chaplain at St. Vincent\u2019s Medical Center, said it\u2019s about more than dollars and cents. He said it\u2019s about patients like his disabled daughter, Kaitlin, who has a rare genetic disorder.\n\n\u201cThe special needs community relies on Connecticut hospitals to provide ongoing care and therapy,\u201d Bolton said. \u201cIt is critically important that hospitals have the funds they need to continue to provide the highest level of care to families across our state.\u201d\n\nRep. Patricia Widlitz, co-chairwoman of the committee, thanked Bolton for reminding the committee that when they debate these issues, \u201cwe\u2019re not looking at just dollars and cents. We\u2019re looking at people.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"publisher": "CT News Junkie", "og": {"url": "http://www.ctnewsjunkie.com/archives/entry/hospital_urge_lawmakers_to_phase_out_tax/", "site_name": "CT News Junkie", "type": "article", "description": "In addition to trying to figure out how to deal with the changing landscape of how hospitals are managed and financed, the legislature\u2019s Finance, Revenue, and Bonding Committee heard testimony Thursday on a bill that would phase out the hospital tax over the next four fiscal years.", "title": "Hospitals Urge Lawmakers To Phase Out Tax | CT News Junkie"}, "robots": "index,follow,archive", "fb": {"admins": 100000516708778, "app_id": 625264840857145}, "google-site-verification": "xSWCEDPXS2srINlbzkJoWA5QowbCkai3awnZqgts9xc", "viewport": "width=1474"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2c1d\"", "article_summary": "Malloy was successful in getting lawmakers that year to approve his proposed budget, including a hospital user tax.\nSince 2000, hospitals were successful at fending off threats that the state would reinstitute a hospital tax, then came the $3.7 billion budget deficit that Gov.\n\u201cThe tax on hospital patients will rise from $101 million to $235 million in July,\u201d Sharp said.\nHe said if enacted, the bill would result in an estimated $75 million revenue loss to the state in 2015.\n\u201cWhen originally proposed, the hospital tax was levied to draw federal funds to help balance the state\u2019s budget,\u201d Frank Corvino, president and CEO of Greenwich Hospital, reminded the committee Thursday."}
