That\u2019s 5.36x what they charge the French for the same exact drug.\n\nAnd Symbicort goes for $60 (45 euros) in France, while in America AstraZeneca charges $272 for the drug, or 4.5x what it charges the French.\n\nMerck is even worse. The pharmaceutical giant charges Americans $197 for Asmanex 200.\n\nAnd how much does Merck charge the French? $25 (19 euros). Yes, Merck charges Americans 7.9x what it charges the French for the exact same drug.\n\nOh, and that\u2019s the price the French pay BEFORE their insurance picks up most or the tab.\n\nI confirmed the price discrepancies while shopping at a local pharmacy in Paris this week.\n\nAs the chart below shows, the drug companies\u2019 actions are even more duplicitous than simplying charging customers more based on their American citizenship.\n\nOver the past five years, GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) has raised the price of Advair by 43% in the US market. But in France, GSK dropped Advair\u2019s price by 13% over the same period.\n\nAstraZeneca similarly raised its prices for Symbicort in America by 40% from 2009 to 2014, while dropping its prices by 17% in France over the same period.\n\nWe\u2019ve written extensively about the incredible mark-up pharmaceutical companies charge Americans. It\u2019s the reason a growing number of US insurance companies are refusing to pay for Advair at all.\n\nOf course, as I noted in a story earlier this year, the NYT got it wrong when it suggested that Advair competitor Symbicort was somehow charging a fair price in comparison. AstraZeneca\u2019s price is only \u201cfair\u201d if you consider gouging Americans with a 4.5x markup better than gouging us with a 5.36x markup.\n\nAs economics professor Steve Kyle explains, the reason the prices are different in the US and France is because the French government negotiates drug prices while the American government does not.\n\nIn fact, it\u2019s illegal for the US government to negotiate the price the Medicare program pays for prescription drugs. Why? Because of US senators like Delaware\u2019s Tom Carper, who are a wholly-owned subsidiary of the drug companies \u2014 in Carper\u2019s case, the company that owns him is AstraZeneca. (The Republicans are just as bad).\n\nSo the next time you consider giving Carper a donation, or voting for him, keep in mind that he\u2019s the reason you\u2019re paying nearly 5x what you should be for that asthma drug that\u2019s saving your kid\u2019s life \u2014 assuming you can afford it at all.\n\nIn fact, an American mom just posted the following on Facebook:\n\nMy son needs Symbicort for his asthma but even with insurance we cannot afford the $90 copay so we no longer buy it. There is no generic. We just keep our fingers crossed he does not have an asthma attack. This article really upsets me.\n\nAs Dr. Thoma wrote yesterday, high copays is one of the ways that insurance companies still manage to undercut health care for people they\u2019re required to cover under Obamacare.\n\nWe\u2019re #1.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Advair, Symbicort charge Americans 5x what they charge Europeans.
