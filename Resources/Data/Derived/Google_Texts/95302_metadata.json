Not surprisingly, \u201cno spin\u201d Bill O\u2019Reilly offered no challenge to Jeffress\u2019 outrageous claims.\n\nMedia Matters has a nice profile of Jeffress\u2019 extremism \u2013 and the media\u2019s knee-jerk acceptance of him as a legitimate commentator. Our own Priscilla has written about his many friendly appearances on Fox.\n\nNow, in his latest right-wing attack disguised as religion, Jeffress told O\u2019Reilly:\n\nThere\u2019s going to be a future world dictator, before Christ returns, who\u2019s going to usurp people\u2019s personal \u2026rights. \u2026He\u2019s going to wage war against God\u2019s people, he\u2019s gonna change God\u2019s laws and he\u2019s going to do it without any opposition. And my question was, how\u2019s he going to be able to pull that off? And my thesis is, people will have been conditioned long before the Antichrist comes to accept governmental overreach. And that\u2019s what you\u2019re seeing with President Obama right now.\n\nJeffress predicted this cataclysm (or is it the apocalypse?) will be worse than the Nazis or Stalinism. But, he said, \u201cI want to be clear\u2026 I\u2019m not saying President Obama is the Antichrist. In fact, I\u2019m sure he\u2019s not. Because the Antichrist is going to have higher poll numbers, according to the Bible, at least at the beginning. But I believe he is conditioning people to accept governmental overreach which they will finally give in to when this final dictator comes, whether that\u2019s ten years from now or a thousand years from now.\"\n\nJeffress assured viewers that Obama \u201cdoesn\u2019t consciously know\u201d the evil he\u2019s bringing down on the country. But it\u2019s not just via ObamaCare, it\u2019s also the contraception mandate and same-sex marriage.\n\n\u201cThe good news is, though, Christ is coming back,\u201d Jeffress assured us. \u201cThe short-term forecast for the world is turbulent, the long-term forecast is good.\u201d\n\nEvidently, he either assumed everyone watching was Christian. Or maybe he just didn\u2019t care whether other people\u2019s views \u2013 religious or otherwise - might see things differently.", "article_metadata": {"csrf-param": "authenticity_token", "google-site-verification": "google51c0b549f514d464.html", "csrf-token": "qttiSScfgIcMOYtTO3Fso/DqqtWFslN2miIo5Dkhx4k=", "og": {"url": "http://www.newshounds.us/robert_jeffress_obamacare_and_gay_marriage_are_preludes_to_the_antichrist_01202014", "site_name": "NewsHounds", "image": "http://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/newshounds/sites/1/meta_images/original/Newshound3_blue.png?1327001871", "type": "article", "title": "Robert Jeffress: ObamaCare And Gay Marriage Are Preludes To The Antichrist"}, "Title": "Robert Jeffress: ObamaCare And Gay Marriage Are Preludes To The Antichrist"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0f98\"", "article_summary": "\u2026He\u2019s going to wage war against God\u2019s people, he\u2019s gonna change God\u2019s laws and he\u2019s going to do it without any opposition.\nExtremist Pastor Robert Jeffress announced to O\u2019Reilly Factor viewers tonight that President Obama is somehow paving the way for the antichrist via ObamaCare, same sex marriage and the contraception mandate.\nBut, he said, \u201cI want to be clear\u2026 I\u2019m not saying President Obama is the Antichrist.\nBecause the Antichrist is going to have higher poll numbers, according to the Bible, at least at the beginning.\nMedia Matters has a nice profile of Jeffress\u2019 extremism \u2013 and the media\u2019s knee-jerk acceptance of him as a legitimate commentator."}
