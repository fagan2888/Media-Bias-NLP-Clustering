RECIFE, Brazil (AP) — The Greece squad surprised its critics to make the second round of the World Cup and has delighted its people back home left downcast by the financial crisis.

It’s not winning many fans in Brazil, though.

Greece squeezed through to the round of 16 with an injury-time penalty for a 2-1 win over Ivory Coast — despite the majority of the Brazilians at the game in Fortaleza loudly backing the African team.

Ahead of Sunday’s knockout game against Costa Rica in Recife, Greece coach Fernando Santos was expecting the locals to be yelling for the Central Americans and again against his team.

“I don’t know why they (Brazilians) don’t like Greece, but anyway,” Santos said on Saturday.

It might be because Greece tends to favor a defensive style that goes against Brazilians’ natural tendency to back open, attacking football. Greece’s only two goals so far at the tournament came in that decisive group game against the Ivorians. The second was a disputed late penalty.

So Santos promised “we will attack as much as possible” against Costa Rica.

Even then, he doesn’t expect to change the minds of many Brazilians and said Greece can’t be “hurt by it.”

“If we had these past three games in this way, the next will probably be the same,” he said. “We hope we can still achieve better results and perhaps in the next match they will still go against Greece. OK. And the next and the next, they will still go against Greece. It doesn’t matter.”
