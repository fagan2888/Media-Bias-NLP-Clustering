It was a quiet second day post-Olympic break practice for the Avalanche Friday. Coach Patrick Roy put his team through a 60-minute workout, much of it emphasizing the power play battle situations in the corners.

Roy did not meet with the media Friday, but the day before he listed his expectations for the near future when play resumes.

“To me, the important thing is that we keep working on details and we apply those details really well, and no bad habits,” Roy said. “That’s what you want to make sure of when you play your first game back (Wednesday against Los Angeles). We’re preparing for (Wednesday).”

Roy put his players through two down-and-back hard skating sessions at the end of both practices. After a day off Saturday, Roy said he will emphasize more strategic drills and not as much skating.

Goalie Semyon Varlamov arrived in Denver early Friday morning, but did not practice. It is unclear when he will resume practice again.
