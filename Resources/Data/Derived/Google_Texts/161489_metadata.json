But Democrats are embracing them.\n\nThe long-term success of President Barack Obama\u2019s new climate regulation probably depends on a Democrat like Hillary Clinton winning the White House \u2014 but it\u2019s not at all clear the rule will help the party\u2019s chances in 2016.\n\nThe tougher coal standards Obama announced Monday will force major adjustments to power companies in Michigan, Ohio and parts of Pennsylvania \u2014 the battleground states Democrats usually need to win the White House. That gives conservatives ample ammunition to insist once again that Democratic leadership will drive up energy prices and wipe out thousands of jobs, a theme that contributed to big losses for the president\u2019s party in the last two midterm elections.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nStill, Democrats insist that embracing Obama\u2019s climate agenda is a winning message for 2016, including with key voting blocs like Hispanics, and they say it offers another opportunity to paint the GOP as anti-science and beholden to corporate polluters. Clinton did exactly that this weekend, when she praised the climate rule while vowing to defend it from \u201cRepublican doubters and defeatists.\u201d In turn, the Republican National Committee attacked Clinton on Monday for supporting \u201cyet another job-killing Obama policy.\u201d\n\nClinton is pushing the climate argument as part of an effort to portray Republican views as backward, a storyline that also encompasses women\u2019s health, relations with Cuba and resistance to the Supreme Court\u2019s same-sex marriage ruling, a campaign official told POLITICO. \u201cThe issue works in terms of painting out a larger narrative around the Republican Party as being out of step and out of touch,\u201d the official said.\n\nClinton \u201cwill continue to invoke and defend the president\u2019s proposal over the course of the campaign,\u201d the official said. \u201cWe think that\u2019s a good issue not just in the upcoming primary audience but among the general electorate.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a turnaround from the 2012 presidential campaign, when Obama rarely even mentioned climate change. Recent polling showing that voters care about the issue \u2014 paired with interest from powerful Democratic donors like green billionaire Tom Steyer \u2014 and have helped convince liberals they should embrace it.\n\nThe stakes in 2016 are especially high for the success of Obama\u2019s power plant rule because of the way he\u2019s carrying it out \u2014 by issuing a set of EPA regulations rather than by enacting a law like the Affordable Care Act. That strategy allowed Obama to get around certain defeat in the GOP-led Congress, but raises the risk of a possible Republican president hobbling and potentially dismantling the regulations.\n\nBoth parties quickly started seizing political turf on the issue Monday, as Republican Ohio Gov. John Kasich vowed to resist the climate rule and Sens. Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.) labeled Obama\u2019s plan a threat to senior citizens and minorities.\n\n\u201cOur seniors will be forced to choose between medical care and meals while paying for a multibillion dollar rule that has no measurable impact on global warming,\u201d Inhofe said in a statement, arguing that it could carry weight with retiree voters. He also contended that the costs of the climate rule \u201cwill be most harmful to low-income and minority communities.\u201d\n\nA day earlier, GOP presidential contender Marco Rubio had warned that Obama\u2019s rule could raise electric bills for customers like \u201ca single mom in Tampa.\u201d\n\nObama openly scoffed at some of those claims while announcing the rule Monday. \u201cIf you care about low-income minority communities, start protecting the air they breathe and stop trying to rob them of their health care,\u201d he said.\n\nClinton and her Democratic primary rivals Martin O\u2019Malley and Bernie Sanders all hailed the rule and even pledged to go beyond it. \u201cIt\u2019s a good plan, and as president, I\u2019d defend it,\u201d Clinton said Sunday, adding, \u201cWe can and must go further.\u201d\n\nSome D.C. veterans doubt that climate change will matter to vast majorities of voters, but acknowledge it could sway some crucial states. \u201cI\u2019m just not convinced issues like this are going to be the things that drives the 2016 election,\u201d said Jim Manley, a former adviser to Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid. \u201cIt might be important in a few states \u2014 like Ohio and Pennsylvania, for instance.\u201d\n\nThen again, Ohio and Pennsylvania may help decide the outcome of 2016.\n\nEach party points to polling to back its case: Democrats cite surveys showing that strong majorities of voters, especially Hispanics and even many Republicans, think the climate threat is real and favor action to address it. But GOP leaders cite polls showing climate change is a low-priority issue, especially compared with the economy.\n\nManley said he thinks Clinton has little choice but to \u201chug the administration\u2019s policies as close as possible\u201d on the climate issue. \u201cIt\u2019s a risk that she\u2019s going to have to take if only because it\u2019s an issue that\u2019s important to a big segment of the base and to many donors as well.\u201d\n\nBut it\u2019s not a big risk for Clinton, argued former Rep. Rick Boucher, a Virginia Democrat who lost his reelection bid amid 2010\u2019s tea party wave after voting for an Obama-supported cap-and-trade climate bill.\n\n\u201cThe table is already set on that issue in these states,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cIn the coal-producing parts of Virginia, Democrats are losing those coal-producing counties. And it\u2019s not going to get any worse if Democrats continue to take the positions that they\u2019ve been taking on climate change.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, conservative candidates face perils on the climate issue too, said former Rep. Bob Inglis, a Republican who now advocates for a carbon tax: They risk being seen as \u201cNeanderthal Republicans\u201d if they refuse to acknowledge the scientific consensus on climate change and decline to offer their own plans for addressing it.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very important for conservative candidates to be careful in their messaging here,\u201d Inglis said. \u201cThey have to say, \u2018We don\u2019t like their solution, but here is a better solution.\u2019\u201d\n\nInglis also likes to warn fellow Republicans that the divisions among the states aren\u2019t set in stone. For instance, he notes, traditional coal states like Ohio and Pennsylvania are moving more heavily toward natural gas, a fuel whose share of the U.S. power supply is expected to continue growing despite the carbon limits in Obama\u2019s plan.\n\nSome coal-state Democrats say Clinton can sell her climate message more effectively in swing, coal-producing states if she talks about technologies to make both coal and natural gas cleaner \u2014 even though many greens regard \u201cclean coal\u201d as an oxymoron.\n\n\u201cIf we take that approach, that\u2019s how we best solve the climate challenge but create harmony between the coal and climate advocates,\u201d said Jon Wood, president of CoalBlue Project, a coalition of pro-coal Democrats. \u201cThere\u2019s no solution here without low-carbon coal.\u201d\n\nWhen Clinton rolled out her green-power strategy last month, her campaign said she would soon release a plan to \u201cprotect the health and retirement security of coalfield workers and their families and provide economic opportunities for those that kept the lights on and factories running for more than a century.\u201d But Wood doubted that will satisfy voters in coal country.\n\nClinton\u2019s coal proposal is \u201cnot harmful, it\u2019s not a negative,\u201d Wood said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be very satisfactory to a lot of people in Western Pennsylvania.\u201d\n\nMichelle Pautz, a political science professor at the University of Dayton, said Democrats should frame the climate rule \u201cthe way Obama did: as something that\u2019s good for the economy,\u201d which would generate jobs in wind and solar power and make power bills cheaper. \u201cEnvironmental issues don\u2019t poll as well in Ohio,\u201d she said.\n\nThey can also try to appeal to the state\u2019s large Catholic population by playing up Pope Francis\u2019 urge to make climate action a moral imperative, Pautz said.\n\nOn the GOP side, supporters of aggressive federal climate action say polls point to a disconnect between Republican voters and candidates.\n\nOn Monday, for example, a poll commissioned by the League of Conservation Voters and the Natural Resources Defense Council Action Fund found that a plurality of Republican primary voters in New Hampshire and South Carolina believe climate change is happening, support limits on carbon pollution and to a lesser degree favor EPA setting \u201cstrict carbon dioxide limits on existing coal-fired power plants with a goal of reducing emissions significantly by the year 2030.\u201d The Republican firm American Viewpoint conducted the survey in July, before Monday\u2019s White House climate rule rollout.\n\nSome Republican advisers acknowledge privately that the GOP is vulnerable to attacks on climate science. And while more hardline GOP candidates outright deny that the planet is warming, others like Rubio and fellow Floridian Jeb Bush have taken more complicated stances. Rubio has danced around the question of whether humans are one cause of climate change, while Bush has openly acknowledged that human activities play a role.\n\nA few Republican donors even see room for the GOP to flip the script entirely by competing in 2016 as the greener party, wielding capitalism instead of government mandates as the solution to global warming.\n\nOne of those is Jay Faison, a Republican businessman who pledges to spend at least $175 million on an effort to get the GOP to take climate change seriously. He thinks the issue will loom larger in the general election.\n\n\u201cI believe you will see more and more Republicans embracing clean energy solutions that minimize Washington bureaucrats and maximize results from the greatest engine of prosperity and innovation the world has ever known,\u201d Faison said by email.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Republicans are banking on the new EPA rules hurting Hillary Clinton.
