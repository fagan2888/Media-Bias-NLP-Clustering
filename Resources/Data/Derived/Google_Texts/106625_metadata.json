With the uptick in minimum wage worker strikes over the past few months (we saw another \u201cround\u201d of them at Wal-Mart stores this past week), I\u2019ve had these conversations quite frequently.\n\nWhat is striking to me is that the starting point for many of these Pastors, Priests and Rabbi\u2019s is to say that they are standing up for \u201cworkers\u2019 rights.\u201d But often when I ask them the most basic questions about business and economic matters \u2013 \u201cwhy do some jobs pay better than others?\u201d \u201cWhat wages and salaries are fair for business owners?\u201d \u201cHow are jobs created?\u201d \u2013 the answer I get is \u201cI don\u2019t know much about economics\u2026I just want what is fair..\u201d\n\nKarl Marx would certainly appreciate this stance on labor relations \u2013 it presumes the absolute best about workers, and the absolute worst about business owners, no matter how virtuously or how poorly either party behaves. But Marxism aside, there are several good reasons why the faith leaders\u2019 stance on labor and work is severely misguided.\n\nIt ignores a major player in the labor market - The protests and demonstrations centered on the plight of employees who work for a minimum wage all seem to conveniently ignore another important party in the labor market \u2013 employers. Gathering people to \u201crage\u201d against business owners is consistent with the teachings of Karl Marx, but is it constructive, and does it fit with the faith leaders\u2019 professed beliefs?\n\nPresumably many of the faith leaders crying out for \u201cworker justice\u201d also provide pastoral counseling services as part of their professional and ministerial duties. But would any good clergyman attempt to do marital counseling with only one spouse in the room? Probably not. And while the employer-employee relationship is not a marriage, it is nonetheless a relationship \u2013 so why are religious leaders championing the needs and interests of one party while not even considering the needs and interests of the other?\n\nIf the faith leaders involved in this activity actually cared for everybody involved in the labor dispute \u2013 and cared enough to actually listen to the local small business owners in their communities \u2013 they might actually learn why it is that some jobs are regarded as \u201centry level\u201d and therefore don\u2019t pay very well. It is sad to see clergymen, purporting to uphold the \u201cdignity of the worker,\u201d nonetheless acting as though business owners themselves are something less than a \u201cworker,\u201d and thus seeking to demonize them.\n\nIt ignores another important player in the labor market - With all the attention showered upon the restaurant and retail workers who walk off the job so they can go chant, walk a picket line, and talk to news reporters, an important fact gets lost in the milieu: an overwhelming majority of workers earning minimum wage at restaurants and big box stores are \u2013 thankfully \u2013 NOT walking off the job. On the contrary, most of them are diligently performing the tasks assigned to them in the job they agreed to accept, and are perhaps focusing their energies on advancing within their existing company or eventually finding a better job.\n\nCoddling disgruntled workers who clock-in at their job and then walk off the work site is like an elementary school teacher focusing all attention on the few kids that are misbehaving and ignoring the students who are performing well. And no business management strategist would advise employers to focus on problem behavior while ignoring productive employees. When faith leaders bestow honor to a worker who seeks to undermine their employer, they make a mockery of the majority of workers who fulfill their responsibilities and play by the rules.\n\nIt undermines more skilled workers \u2013 As well intentioned as the faith leaders\u2019 efforts might be as they try to exhibit empathy for low-skilled, low wage earning workers, they are slapping many skilled workers in the face. It\u2019s as if members of the clergy have no comprehension of the struggle many Americans willingly face in order to get themselves educated, to develop new skill sets, and to remain viable in the marketplace.\n\nThe minimum wage debate strikes to the heart of this struggle. As they stand with striking fast food workers who demand a fifteen dollar an hour wage, many faith leaders appear clueless about how many other kinds of jobs in our economy require education, degrees, and certifications, yet don\u2019t pay much more than fifteen dollars an hour.\n\nTake \u201cI.T.\u201d technicians, dental assistants, teacher\u2019s aids and medical assistants as examples. People who work in these fields usually have to take courses, pass tests, and acquire certificates and licensures in order to qualify for a job in their field, and they often spend hundreds if not thousands of their own dollars to get appropriately trained. Yet many of them earn wages in the $10 to $25 an hour range \u2013 in some cases not much more than what disgruntled fast food workers are demanding.\n\nWhen faith leaders argue that workers with low skill levels are deserving of the same or nearly the same wages as workers who have sought to develop their skills, they undermine people who have disciplined themselves and have pursued the difficult task of self-development. It is saddening to see faith leaders ignore this.\n\nIt fails to address the real problem \u2013 Unless you\u2019ve been living under a rock for the past couple of years, you\u2019ve probably heard about the tremendous economic success of specific regions around the U.S. Take for example, North Dakota. This little state is in the midst of a big economic boom that has produced low un-employment and wages for many low skill workers that are well over the mandated minimum wage.\n\nThat\u2019s because the people of North Dakota have wisely chosen to utilize their natural resources \u2013 oil in particular \u2013 and to sell that resource around the world. The oil-based energy industry is creating genuinely new wealth in that state, which has in turn elevated wages in nearly every sector of the economy (even at Wal-mart!).\n\nThe problem of low wages will not be solved by merely seeking to re-distribute increasing portions of wealth out of the hands of the few and into the hands of the chosen \u2013 as the demand for a higher minimum wage does. Rather, the problem will only be addressed when Americans begin to understand the key ingredients that required in an economy that creates wealth and prosperity for all.\n\nWill America\u2019s faith leaders begin to learn what those ingredients are? Or will they simply continue to pursue some arbitrary understanding of \u201cfairness\u201d while not understanding the slightest thing about economics?", "article_metadata": {"description": "\u201cI just want what is fair for everybody\u2026\u201d If I\u2019ve heard that line once, I\u2019ve heard it hundreds of times on those occasions when I end up discussing business, economic, and public policy issues with members of the clergy..05/26/2016 0:19:28AM EST.", "author": "Austin Hill", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "\u201cI just want what is fair for everybody\u2026\u201d If I\u2019ve heard that line once, I\u2019ve heard it hundreds of times on those occasions when I end up discussing business, economic, and public policy issues with members of the clergy.", "title": "- Pursuing Economic \u201cFairness\u201d Without Understanding Economics", "url": "http://townhall.com/columnists/austinhill/2014/01/19/pursuing-economic-fairness-without-understanding-economics-n1781232", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2013/357/2013-12-23T060326Z_1_CBRE9BM0GU900_RTROPTP_3_USA-FISCAL-VOTE.JPG", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "\u201cI just want what is fair for everybody\u2026\u201d If I\u2019ve heard that line once, I\u2019ve heard it hundreds of times on those occasions when I end up discussing business, economic, and public policy issues with members of the clergy.", "title": "- Pursuing Economic \u201cFairness\u201d Without Understanding Economics", "url": "http://townhall.com/columnists/austinhill/2014/01/19/pursuing-economic-fairness-without-understanding-economics-n1781232", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2013/357/2013-12-23T060326Z_1_CBRE9BM0GU900_RTROPTP_3_USA-FISCAL-VOTE.JPG", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Pursuing Economic \u201cFairness\u201d Without Understanding Economics, Austin Hill, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd227f\"", "article_summary": "Or will they simply continue to pursue some arbitrary understanding of \u201cfairness\u201d while not understanding the slightest thing about economics?\nBut Marxism aside, there are several good reasons why the faith leaders\u2019 stance on labor and work is severely misguided.\nWill America\u2019s faith leaders begin to learn what those ingredients are?\nWith the uptick in minimum wage worker strikes over the past few months (we saw another \u201cround\u201d of them at Wal-Mart stores this past week), I\u2019ve had these conversations quite frequently.\nThe minimum wage debate strikes to the heart of this struggle."}
