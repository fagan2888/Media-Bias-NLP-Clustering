Here\u2019s a look at some corporate leaders\u2019 recent time off \u2013 or for some, time still connected. From shopping in Capri to cliff jumping in Wyoming, these executives have covered a lot of ground \u2013 sometimes with a few conference calls wedged in. As told to Rachel Feintzeig.\n\nDavid Morken, CEO and co-founder of telecommunications company Bandwidth.com Inc.\n\nMy wife, six children and I just got back from two weeks in Wyoming. We always try to do something outdoorsy \u2013 two years ago we did a seven-day trek across the interior of Norway. This year, we focused on climbing in the Wind River mountains and the Teton mountains. We went rafting, cliff jumping and hiked eight miles to a waterfall where we sat in hot springs. Our kids are nine to 21 years old so we\u2019ve got a lot of energy to deploy.\n\nWhen I was on vacation, our chief operating officer was in charge. Our company policy is a true embargo. I was prohibited from contacting work and work was prohibited from contacting me. We protect the personal lives of our employees and we also establish resiliency within the chain of command by requiring other people to step up and captain the ship. They may make a decision that\u2019s not as good as the person who\u2019s on vacation may have made, but that is a near-term tradeoff.\n\nWhen I\u2019m on vacation, I don\u2019t worry about work \u2014 I\u2019m usually worried about grizzly bears or making sure the kids are all fed and watered appropriately on the trail. But it does take me about 72 hours to get to the peaceful frame of mind that allows me to be completely present with my family.\n\nSteve Smith, CEO of Equinix, works on his iPad mini in Chianti, Italy.\n\nSteve Smith, CEO of data-center company Equinix Inc.\n\nLast summer, my family went on a nine-day vacation in Italy and I met them for three or four days in some remote villa in some beautiful little place in the middle of nowhere. There was not good reception. I had to go into town to find a hot spot. I found myself doing it three times a day. Time zones are never an excuse for me. When you\u2019re running internet infrastructure you can\u2019t afford to not be plugged in. I get over 100 emails a day. If I just checked out for three days, I don\u2019t like the workload I\u2019d have to plow through.\n\nBut some Silicon Valley executives\u2013 you would not believe the pace these guys lead. Some of these people at places like Apple and Google, they get up at four in the morning. I\u2019m always working but I get up at 5:30 a.m. I feel like a slacker.\n\nAlan Trefler, CEO of Pegasystems, with his dogs on a \u201cstaycation\u201d in Brookline, Mass.\n\nAlan Trefler, founder and CEO of software firm Pegasystems Inc.\n\nMy last vacation was in December. It was a staycation at my home in Brookline, Mass. All the little things I\u2019m tasked with \u2013 installing the new TiVos, upgrading the routers \u2013 had piled up. I was here with my screwdriver and my brother in law who\u2019s an electrical engineer and we just sort of made things work. This took the better part of a week. It\u2019s actually pretty fun to put some effort into something and see it work. So much of my normal business is tied up in extremely delayed gratification. Being able to pick a project, execute and have people look at it and say, \u201cWow, that worked,\u201d is pretty satisfying.\n\nI can actually shift out of work mode into more strategic mode pretty quickly. I take advantage of that and as a result I don\u2019t think I need as many vacations.\n\nMike Depatio, CEO of Kimpton Hotels, fly fishing in Montana.

I set an out-of-office and my assistant knows she can call me on my cellphone if something really important comes up. Other than that, I don\u2019t want to be disturbed. This summer, I\u2019m going fly fishing two times in Last Chance, Idaho (and once in Ennis, Montana) where cellphones don\u2019t work. I take long weekends, from Thursday to Sunday, with a bunch of fishing buddies or family. If someone really needs to get a hold of me, they can call on a land line at the main lodge and track me down. That person\u2019s usually my wife.\n\nTaking time away from the office allows me to be creative, recharge and reconnect with myself. It helps me clear my head and focus back on things that are more important rather than what\u2019s urgent. Emails are usually urgent but not important.\n\nJon Gacek, CEO of Quantum, with his daughter in Capri, Italy\n\nJon Gacek, CEO of data-storage company Quantum Corp.\n\nI embrace all the connectivity and all the technology to give myself flexibility. I don\u2019t really take a vacation so to speak \u2013 over the last 15 years, I\u2019ve probably taken about two vacations that were trips for my kids\u2019 high school graduations. Instead, I tack on a few days at the end of work trips. Last summer, I was in France for a week of meeting customers and I went and spent the weekend with my daughter in Italy. She was near Rome doing a summer program through her college. We drove down to Sorrento and went shopping in Capri. We ate good Italian food \u2013 a lot of pizza. She\u2019s a lot like me \u2014 very high energy \u2013 so we crammed a lot into three days.\n\nI\u2019m always plugged in; the kids are used to me taking an hour or two or three to get on a conference call. And then we\u2019ll go and do something fun.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "Rafting, cliff jumping...conference calls.", "title": "The Boss\u2019s Summer Vacation: Rafting, Hiking\u2026and Email", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/atwork/2014/08/19/the-bosss-summer-vacation-rafting-hiking-and-conference-calls/", "image": {"src": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-ED241_vacati_P_20140815163553.jpg"}, "site": "WSJ", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Careers", "article.headline": "The Boss\u2019s Summer Vacation: Rafting, Hiking\u2026and Email", "description": "Rafting, cliff jumping...conference calls.", "article_section": "Careers", "author": "Rachel Feintzeig", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "At Work Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "At Work", "article.summary": "Rafting, cliff jumping...conference calls.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2014-08-19T23:12:21-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-140", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/atwork/2014/08/19/the-bosss-summer-vacation-rafting-hiking-and-conference-calls/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-ATWORKB-1993", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Careers", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "Rafting, cliff jumping...conference calls.", "title": "The Boss\u2019s Summer Vacation: Rafting, Hiking\u2026and Email", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/atwork/2014/08/19/the-bosss-summer-vacation-rafting-hiking-and-conference-calls/", "image": {"width": 749, "identifier": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-ED241_vacati_P_20140815163553.jpg", "height": 499}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "At Work", "article.id": "BL-ATWORKB-1993", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2014-08-20T18:05:23-04:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb704\"", "article_summary": "This summer, I\u2019m going fly fishing two times in Last Chance, Idaho (and once in Ennis, Montana) where cellphones don\u2019t work.\nWhen I\u2019m on vacation, I don\u2019t worry about work \u2014 I\u2019m usually worried about grizzly bears or making sure the kids are all fed and watered appropriately on the trail.\nIt can be hard to get away if your job title is CEO but that doesn\u2019t mean executives skip vacation altogether.\nWe went rafting, cliff jumping and hiked eight miles to a waterfall where we sat in hot springs.\nI was prohibited from contacting work and work was prohibited from contacting me."}
