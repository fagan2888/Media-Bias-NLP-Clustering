Bates is a pretty good speaker, but things got quite a bit more exciting when a surprise guest showed up: Oregon\u2019s candidate for U.S. Senate, Monica Wehby.\n\nWehby was barnstorming the Metro Area on the evening of Friday, Oct. 10, bringing her nationalized conservative message to believers and skeptics alike. You won\u2019t find a better mix of believers and skeptics than the loyal crew at AFP, and though some in attendance have obviously been affected in their estimation of the candidate by the ongoing negative media bombardment that Dr. Wehby has been subjected to, it is accurate to say the neophyte candidate did her best to win them over.\n\nWehby\u2019s appearance came in the context of an unsavory revelation for the Democratic power structure in Oregon. Willamette Week had reported earlier in the week that Gov. Kitzhaber\u2019s girlfriend, Cylvia Hayes, had illegally married an Ethiopian immigrant much younger than her to help him with his legal status. Hayes, who has become a policymaker in the Kitzhaber administration, received in the neighborhood of $5,000 for the arrangement, and claims that the governor only found out about it on Oct. 8.\n\nThis episode added a narrative wrinkle to the catalogue of Blue-State sins already ascribed to the Democrats\u2014specifically over half-billion dollars wasted on two major league debacles, the Cover Oregon website, and the Columbia River Crossing. Wehby\u2019s opponent, Sen. Jeff Merkely, has left fingerprints on both policy disasters.\n\nIt would be too easy to characterize Wehby\u2019s AFP audience as \u201cthe choir.\u201d Many have taken to heart reports about Wehby avoiding debates, and others have qualms about reports that have surfaced about her personal life. Her position on same-sex marriage has given many conservatives with traditional religious belief pause.\n\nOther conservative arguments against the one-party rule besetting the state are Oregon\u2019s national state ranking of 49th in high school graduation rates, and another controversial Kitzhaber policy, also supported by Merkely, which seeks to award driver\u2019s cards to illegal aliens.\n\nAt the AFP meet-up, Wehby wasn\u2019t shy about pillorying Merkely for his signature on a 2012 letter written to IRS Commissioner Douglas H. Shulman, asking for increased scrutiny of groups seeking tax-exempt status as a 501(c) (4) nonprofit organization. Merkely was joined in his appeal to Shulman by fellow textbook big-government senators like Chuck Schumer, Tom Udall, and, Minnesota\u2019s Saturday Night Live-alumnus seat-holder, Al Franken.\n\nThe end result of that letter has become political legend, in a bad way, with conservative groups preponderantly singled-out by the IRS for prohibitive scrutiny.\n\n\u201cImagine trying to use a federal agency to silence your political opposition,\u201d said Wehby.\n\nIn keeping with the national overarch of her campaign strategy, Wehby referenced President Barack Obama\u2019s disapproval numbers, which are averaging around the withering figure of 70 percent. She also didn\u2019t neglect to drop two sound-bite incendiaries, which for a growing number of Americans, have come to signify America\u2019s rudderless foreign policy under this commander in chief: ISIS and Ebola.\n\nInterestingly, Wehby vowed if elected to \u201cfix\u201d the Affordable Care Act, not repeal it, a meme gathering primacy in conservative circles which holds that ObamaCare will never be repealed.\n\nWehby didn\u2019t specifically mention the recent scandal involving the quality of care, or lack thereof, that the men and women who have served in the military received from our veterans hospitals. Former Secretary of Veteran\u2019s Affairs Eric Shinseki resigned in the shadow of abysmal reports about the agency, including some reported instances that resulted in patient deaths.\n\nWehby vows to make \u201cbetter care of our vets\u201d a cornerstone of her term in office. \u201cI\u2019ve taken some shots,\u201d she told the 200 in attendance at the Clackamas Public Safety Training Center, \u201cbut they\u2019ve taken the real bullets.\u201d\n\nWehby also took the opportunity of debunking what she calls the \u201cbogus\u201d narrative that Portland\u2019s left-of-center press has harped in heavy rotation, that she was ducking the senatorial debates.\n\n\u201cWe accepted five debates, Merkely only accepted one, in Medford,\u201d Wehby said bluntly. \u201cHe would not do KOIN, he would not do OPB. This business about me ducking the debates is partisan spin.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy opponent is considered the eighth most vulnerable senator by Roll Call,\u201d Wehby said, referencing the venerable DC publication\u2019s current rankings during her 30-minute speech. \u201cMeanwhile, 60,000 more Oregonians have gotten food stamps than have gotten jobs on Jeff Merkley\u2019s watch.\u201d\n\nFeatured image from the public domain via Wikimedia Commons.\n\nU-Choose Education Forum Our goal is to educate Oregonians on issues.
