When it comes to where you want to live, there's more to consider than rainless weather and rents that won't break your bank. You might like to land, for example, in a state that pays women well, provides ample job opportunities, and supports women-owned businesses. And these are just a few of the 15 metrics personal finance website WalletHub analyzed across the country to find the best and worst states for women to live.

According to the website's report, released this week, serious gender gaps persist in our country: Women account for nearly three-fifths of all minimum-wage workers. They also constitute the majority of poor, uninsured adults in at least 19 states where government officials have refused to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act.

But there are places where women can find opportunities and even thrive, the report shows. Wallethub graded the 50 states and Washington, D.C. on a 100-point scale, with 100 being ideal and 0 being downright scary-bad. To earn the tops scores, states like Minnesota had to show statistically that their female residents earn the highest median wages, open the most businesses, and are offered the best health care. Meanwhile, the lowest ranking states, such as Louisiana, have the most women living in poverty, the highest high school dropout rates, and the most victims of violent crimes.

Here, according to WalletHub's analysis, are the top 15 states where women could live.
