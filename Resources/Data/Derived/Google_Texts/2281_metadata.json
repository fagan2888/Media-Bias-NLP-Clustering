The battle to beat Begich, a moderate Democrat representing a staunchly conservative state, is one of the GOP\u2019s top targets as it vies to retake control of the Senate in November. The GOP primary is Aug. 26.\n\n\n\nFor Sullivan, the endorsement is a coveted one. It is just the fourth Senate primary into which the deep-pocketed Club for Growth has waded into this year, following the endorsements of GOP candidates Ben Sasse in Nebraska, Chris McDaniel in Mississippi and Tom Cotton in Arkansas. The decision was the product of a meticulous vetting process that illustrates how the political power structure has shifted.\n\nChanges to campaign-finance law have atomized the political process, diminishing the clout wielded by party committees and empowering outside groups that can raise and spend unlimited sums boosting their chosen candidates. One of the fronts in this battle is candidate selection, a process formerly controlled by the parties. Instead of courting county chairman or decision-makers at the party hubs, candidates form a column to visit the outside operators who can lavish money on the cause.\n\nThat means if you are a Republican candidate, you have probably trooped to the Club\u2019s office suite in downtown Washington, either to seek the group\u2019s imprimatur or forestall an onslaught against you. Back in January, the group had already conducted more than 100 candidate interviews for the 2014 cycle.\n\nThe Club does not simply endorse the most impressive candidates, Chocola told TIME in January. It looks for races where its money and muscle can make the difference, starting with safe, open Republican seats. Its secondary targets are incumbent Republicans who are seen as straying from pro-growth principles. That tactic has incensed many fellow Republicans, who argue it squanders capital that could be spent ousting Democrats. But the Club sees two benefits. \u201cIf you win, you get a better vote; and two, you get the attention of a whole bunch of other incumbents, and there\u2019s a ripple effect,\u201d Chocola says. \u201cThey start voting better when one of their colleagues gets beat.\u201d The third category is attractive Republicans capable of knocking off vulnerable Democrats, such as in Alaska, where Begich has a target on his back.\n\nAn endorsement requires an interview, which generally involves three or four Club staffers peppering candidates about topics ranging from farm subsidies and free trade to student loans and flood insurance. Acing the policy murder board is requisite, but not sufficient. If a perfect candidate is going to coast to victory, the Club won\u2019t endorse; likewise, if he or she has no shot and winning, it won\u2019t get money either. \u201cWe look for a disparity in the quality of the candidate,\u201d Chocola says. \u201cThe perfect setup is a really good guy versus a really bad guy in a safe district with a cheap media market.\u201d\n\nIn recent cycles, the Club has given a boost to most of the Senate\u2019s most conservative members, including Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz and Mike Lee. \u201cWe\u2019re risk takers,\u201d Chocola says. \u201cWe don\u2019t expect to win every race.\u201d But it is also more cautious with its endorsements than other conservative outside groups, such as the Senate Conservatives Fund or FreedomWorks. And it is behind its normal pace in backing candidates this cycle, with just six total endorsements\u2014down from 26 in 2010 and 18 in 2012. The number may be a tacit admission that the current crop of challengers is weaker than in past cycles. Of the Tea Party-aligned candidates running against GOP senators this year, only McDaniel is thought is have a good chance of toppling the incumbent.\n\nIn many cases, the Club\u2019s support of uncompromising conservatives pits it against the Republican establishment. Alaska may be an exception, as Sullivan is thought to be the preferred candidate of the party as well.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Club for Growth gives Dan Sullivan a leg up in his bid to unseat Sen.
