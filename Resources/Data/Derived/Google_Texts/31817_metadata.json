There are others who will be looking to pick up that UnitedHealth business,\" Waldmann told Reuters.\n\nChief Executive Trevor Fetter said Tenet has followed a deliberate strategy to ensure its hospitals are included as in-network choices by insurers on the exchanges, and that effort has generated strong admissions growth.\n\nDallas-based Tenet on Monday reported that admissions to its hospitals of patients insured through the exchanges climbed more than 27 percent in the first quarter compared with a year ago.\n\n\"It is important for us to do everything to make sure the exchanges are viable and successful, and that consumers perceive value and choice in the exchanges,\" Fetter said in an interview.\n\n(Reporting by Susan Kelly in Chicago; Editing by Cynthia Osterman)\n\nRead the original article on Reuters.
