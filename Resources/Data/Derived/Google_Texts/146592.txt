About 11.3 million people are enrolled in health plans purchased through online exchanges created by the Affordable Care Act. That includes 408,147 people in Pennsylvania.

The total, which was announced this week, is higher than the Obama administration's goal of 10 million for 2016. It will likely rise higher since enrollment at www.healthcare.gov continues until the end of January.

The federal government said that, of the people enrolled for 2016, about 26 percent are between the ages of 18 and 34. That's a closely watched number since younger, healthier people are needed to offset the costs of older, sicker customers.

The federal government said the 11.3 million total enrollment figure was comprised of about 3 million new customers with the rest being returning customers.

The government said that 83 percent of the people who enrolled qualified for federal help toward their monthly premiums, with the average subsidy amounting to $294 per month.

The final enrollment number reached at the end of January will likely dwindle. That's because people won't be considered officially enrolled unless they are paying their premiums.

For example, as of the end of last year's open enrollment, 11.7 million people had signed up. As of the end of last March, the figure had fallen to about 10.2 million, and had fallen to 9.9 million as of the end of June, according to CNBC. The Obama administration's goal for 2105 was 9.1 million "effectuated" enrollees -- people who enrolled and continued making monthly premiums.

As of last summer, about 516,000 Pennsylvania residents were enrolled in coverage purchased through the exchange.
