That is what the state of Wyoming is well on their way to doing by rejecting this amendment.\n\nLEGAL BACKGROUND\n\nDuring the Obamacare case before the Supreme Court, Rob Natelson and his colleagues at the Independence Institute argued that the law\u2019s provisions forcing the states to expand Medicaid were unconstitutional. Neither the Constitution nor case law, they pointed out, permits the federal government to use federal spending programs to coerce the states. Seven of the nine justices agreed with them, essentially adopting the arguments advanced in their brief.\n\nAs a result, the states may decide, without federal interference \u2013 whether or not to accept additional federal funds for the Medicaid expansion. Accepting federal funds might seem to bring the states short-term fiscal benefits. But the fiscal risks of doing so are very great\u2014perhaps eventual bankruptcy. Rejecting Medicaid expansion can help states stay fiscally solvent while making Obamacare more difficult to implement by the federal government.\n\nThe vote today in Florida was a powerful, and effective, rebuke of Obamacare.\n\nAfter 7hrs of respectful debate, Fla House defeats Obamacare\u2019s Medicaid Expansion 72-41. Now let\u2019s work together for solutions. #sayfie \u2014 Dane Eagle (@DaneEagle) June 5, 2015\n\n\u201cOur position at the Tenth Amendment Center is that we need to do everything we can to keep this thing (Obamacare) from getting its tenitcals into the system,\u201d said Mike Maharrey of the Tenth Amendment Center. \u201cWe need to force the federal government to back off of this horrible health care plan and we need to go back and start looking at free market solutions and state-based solutions where states actually have some control and aren\u2019t being dictated everything by the feds.\u201d\n\nRelated posts", "article_metadata": {"description": "TALLAHASSEE, Fla.
