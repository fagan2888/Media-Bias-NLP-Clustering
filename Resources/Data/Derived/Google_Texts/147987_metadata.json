Saturday morning alone they pulled over at least 12 people for speeding.\n\nThat\u2019s why, June through August, deputies have stepped up their efforts, as part of Operation Safe Travels, to crack down on speeding drivers.\n\nThey\u2019re patrolling the busy roads to and from the beaches to make all vacationers, like best friends Carolyn and Laine, more aware of their speed.\n\n\"We\u2019re from Cleveland, Missouri,\u201d Carolyn said. \u201cWhich is south of Kansas City about 40 miles.\"\n\nCarolyn, her mother and her best friend, Laine, stopped on County Road 331. Like many vacationers ahead and behind of them, they stopped for a picture with the \u201cWelcome to Florida\u201d sign greeting them at the Alabama-Florida border.\n\n\"We have a group of about a little over 20 people going down to a beach house on Panama City Beach,\u201d Laine said. \u201cAnd we're really excited about it!\"\n\nThey are just a few of the thousands of people who make their way to the beaches every summer and take 331 to get there.\n\nAccording to the sheriff\u2019s department, busy roads leading to the beach, like 331 and Highway 98, see three times as many accidents as other roads in the county.\n\nAccording to Lieutenant Dewey Adams, the department hopes Operation Safe Travels makes people, especially tourists, check their speed.\n\nAdams said they have seen a growth in the number of visitors to Walton County in the last few years and don\u2019t expect that to slow down any time soon.\n\nAlthough Carolyn and Laine are ready for summer fun, they said they have been taking it easy on the road.\n\n\"We actually have a surf board on top of our car,\u201d Laine said. \u201cSo we're kind of having to maintain our slower speed so it doesn't go flying off.\"\n\nLt. Adams said deputies will do a similar operation when schools starts. Named for the Blue Bird yellow school buses, Operation Blue Bird will provide concentrated enforcement to make sure people are driving safely near school zones and bus stops.", "article_metadata": {"description": "From June through August, deputies have stepped up their efforts to crack down on speeding drivers.
