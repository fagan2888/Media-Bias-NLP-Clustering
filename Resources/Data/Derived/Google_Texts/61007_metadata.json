Ted Cruz has studiously avoided conflict with the combative frontrunner Donald Trump. He has repeatedly declined to criticize Trump\u2019s most controversial claims and proposals, typically only saying that he \u201cdisagrees\u201d with him if he\u2019s pressed.\n\nHowever, with Cruz making a run at Trump in the polls, it looks as though The Donald may be getting ready to use an ill-considered comment the Texas senator made in a private meeting with supporters as an excuse to go on the attack.\n\nRelated: Trump, Cruz Are denounced in Senate for Shutting Out Muslims\n\nTrump has often claimed that he is only a \u201ccounterpuncher,\u201d meaning that he doesn\u2019t attack other candidates unless they attack him first. It\u2019s largely, if not completely, true. If Trump wants to maintain that position, he can\u2019t go to war with Cruz without provocation.\n\nOn Friday, it looked as though a New York Times story recounting a meeting between Cruz and his donors might have provided Trump with the Tonkin Gulf incident he needs to launch the Trump-Cruz war.\n\nIn the Wednesday meeting in New York, Cruz discussed Trump and another leading candidate, Ben Carson. \u201cBoth of them I like and respect,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cI don\u2019t believe either one of them is going to be our president.\u201d\n\nCruz said that recent terror attacks have caused voters to look more seriously at candidates\u2019 capacity to serve as commander-in-chief and their ability to understand and address the threats facing the country.\n\nRelated: It\u2019s Not Just Trump Playing Fast and Loose with the Facts\n\nOn the topic of Trump and Carson, he said, \u201cWho am I comfortable having their finger on the button? Now that\u2019s a question of strength, but it\u2019s also a question of judgment. And I think that is a question that is a challenging question for both of them.\u201d\n\nCruz explained that he has been reluctant to attack either Trump or Cruz because, in effect, he believes they will flame out and that their supporters will come over to him.\n\n\u201cSo my approach, much to the frustration of the media, has been to bear hug both of them, and smother them with love,\u201d he told his audience. \u201cPeople run as who they are. I believe gravity will bring both of those campaigns down\u201d and \u201cthe lion\u2019s share of their supporters come to us.\u201d\n\nCruz\u2019s campaign challenged the Times story at first, but the senator\u2019s claim that it was misleading fell apart when it was revealed that the newspaper had a recording of Cruz making those remarks.\n\nRelated: Why Ted Cruz Is Surging in the Polls\n\nThat Cruz bothered pushing back at all shows just how cautious he has been about handling Trump. By campaign standards, criticizing your rival by saying it will be a \u201cchallenge\u201d to prove he or she would be a capable commander-in-chief is pretty weak tea.\n\nBut if Trump needed an excuse to lash out at the candidate who has shown the most upward movement in the polls recently, Cruz\u2019s comment would serve as well as anything else.\n\nOn Thursday night, Trump\u2019s campaign began responding. Senior advisor Dan Scavino said of Cruz on Twitter: \u201chis true colors shine behind the scenes - at a private fundraiser.\u201d\n\nBy Friday morning, Trump himself was in on the act, first tweeting out, \u201cLooks like @tedcruz is getting ready to attack. I am leading by so much he must. I hope so, he will fall like all others. Will be easy!\u201d\n\nRelated: Welcome to the Weird World of Ted Cruz Fan Art\n\nShortly afterward, he added, \u201c@tedcruz should not make statements behind closed doors to his bosses, he should bring them out into the open - more fun that way!\u201d\n\nWhether he will continue going after Cruz is unclear, but it\u2019s probably no mistake that Trump took his first few swipes at the senator just a few hours before he would speak at a big campaign rally in the key early voting state of Iowa.\n\nCruz has been surging in the Midwestern state, where many white evangelical Protestants are receptive to his message. One recent poll had him leading Trump for the first time.\n\nIf he gets pulled into a fight with Trump, it\u2019s not clear how Cruz would respond or how effective Trump\u2019s typical tactics \u2013 personal insults and sarcasm \u2013 will do I Iowa. But at least one analyst believes Cruz may have less to lose than he thinks.\n\nRelated: Here\u2019s Why Trump Is No Sure Thing in Early Voting States\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s interesting is that Cruz has just been assuming that he will inherit the lion\u2019s share of Trump\u2019s support, and I\u2019m not sure that true,\u201d said Kyle Kondik, managing editor of Sabato\u2019s Crystal Ball at the University of Virginia\u2019s Center for Politics.\n\n\u201cTrump\u2019s support is very hard to categorize,\u201d he said. \u201cIf Trump were to get out, his supporters are ideologically across the map, so you would assume that to the extent his supporters might show up and vote, they could be split six different ways.\u201d\n\nThe problem for Cruz, said Kondik, is that gaming out a race with more than a dozen candidates is ridiculously complicated.\n\n\u201cI understand that Cruz doesn\u2019t want to alienate Trump\u2019s supporters, but if Cruz doesn\u2019t help defeat Trump, then maybe Trump does better than Cruz, and then Cruz has done nothing to halt the momentum of a candidate who could prevent him from winning.\n\n\u201cAll the candidates sort of recognize that if you knock down Trump it may help a candidate other than themselves. It\u2019s this weird game theory race. In a two-person race, it\u2019s a zero-sum game. But not in a 14-person race.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "On Friday, it looked as though a New York Times story recounting a meeting between Sen.
