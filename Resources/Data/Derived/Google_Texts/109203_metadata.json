There\u2019s been much said and written about whether the New Jersey governor is too much of a \u201cNortheastern moderate\u201d to be acceptable to Republican primary voters in the Tea Party era. But this, it seemed to me, missed the point about Christie. Yes, he said nice things about President Obama after Hurricane Sandy, accepted the Affordable Care Act\u2019s Medicaid expansion and even dared to defend a Muslim he nominated to a judgeship against accusations that he would implement Shariah law. But on plenty other issues, he was further right than many realized. He is no Rudy Giuliani-style apostate on immigration and gun control, having waffled on the former and blocked several gun restrictions passed by the Democratic legislature. He has opposed higher taxes on the wealthy to close the state\u2019s yawning budget gaps. He refused to set up an exchange under the ACA. He cut funding for Planned Parenthood.\n\nMore importantly, whatever deviations Christie has made from the party line would, it has long seemed to me, be overcome by his knack for tapping into the conservative id on a visceral level, in ways that Giuliani never could\u2014indeed, in ways that many of the seemingly more conservative 2016 contenders are unable to do. The scorn with which Christie lashes into, say, teachers\u2019 union members lights up an emotional response from many rank-and-file Republicans that no checklist of issue-by-issue orthodoxy ever could.\n\nBut if Christie\u2019s rough-edged rhetoric was going to help him bond with west-of-the-Delaware-River conservatives, the flipside of his Jersey personality has also loomed all along as his biggest vulnerability. In the lingo of the consultants, there was a question of whether Christie was plausibly \u201cpresidential.\u201d He was not only aspiring to be the first heavily overweight commander in chief since William Howard Taft. He was someone who had\u2014to name just a few instances\u2014hollered at a former Navy Seal who dared to question him at a town hall meeting; gotten in a confrontation on a Jersey Shore boardwalk; and had this to say, over the microphone, to a female heckler yelling something about jobs at a Mitt Romney rally in New Hampshire: \u201cYou know something may go down tonight, but it ain\u2019t gonna be jobs, sweetheart.\u201d Yes, he really said that.\n\nThis is why the release of e-mails showing, in highly colorful terms, his office\u2019s direct involvement in the closure of two local access lanes to the George Washington Bridge in September to punish the Fort Lee mayor, a Democrat, for not endorsing Christie is so damaging. Christie\u2019s problem all along has not been that he would be seen as too Giuliani, but that he would be seen as too Nixon\u2014a Republican whose curious ideological mix of moderation and conservatism is overshadowed by a toxic combination of insecurity and power-hungriness that leads to a politics of spite and retribution. Remember, Christie and his team were pulling all the stops last year to ring up Democratic endorsements and run up his vote tally in a re-election where his victory was never in doubt\u2014just like a certain other chief executive's reelection 41 years earlier.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "//assets.newrepublic.com/assets/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "Why the bridge scandal is so damaging", "og": {"site_name": "New Republic", "description": "Chris Christie's 2016 prospects were always about personality, not ideology.
