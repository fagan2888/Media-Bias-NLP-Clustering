I mean, I think they\u2019re clear violations of the First Amendment, depressing aftertastes of the Red Scare era adopted by trolling evangelicals as part of an entire campaign to promote a false vision of American history and our supposed founding ideals, and I\u2019m glad the ACLU fights them. But all that aside, a Ten Commandments monument outside the Oklahoma statehouse isn\u2019t a hill I plan on dying on, not when there are more important battles to fight, like the expansion of Medicare to all Americans and the forced collectivization of major league sports teams.\n\nBut while I will not protest too loudly about your Ten Commandments tribute, I will definitely loudly support the erection of this amazing statue to Satan, which some Satanists would like to put up outside the Oklahoma state Capitol, site of a Ten Commandments monument since 2012.\n\nHere\u2019s Satan \u2014 or, more accurately, Baphomet the Sabbatic Goat, an occult symbol since the 19th century, adopted by Crowleyans and then LaVeyan Satanists in the 20th \u2014 relaxing on his throne with a couple of adorable tykes by his side. It\u2019s also interactive!\n\n\u201cThe monument has been designed to reflect the views of Satanists in Oklahoma City and beyond,\u201d temple spokesman Lucien Greaves said in a statement. \u201cThe statue will also have a functional purpose as a chair where people of all ages may sit on the lap of Satan for inspiration and contemplation.\u201d\n\nI mean, yes, this obviously belongs outside Oklahoma\u2019s state Capitol. It belongs outside every state capitol. And city hall.
