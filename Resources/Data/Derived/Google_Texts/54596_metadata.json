The administration also expects to spend less this year than previously forecast on health insurance subsidies for low-income families under the Affordable Care Act. The price of those subsidies is now predicted to be slightly higher, however, over the coming decade.\n\nWhile the analysis brought good news for the short term, the outlook for the longer term was less rosy: The White House predicts that the nation\u2019s finances will deteriorate markedly over the next decade, with deficits rising nearly $600 billion above previous projections.\n\nThe administration attributes the shift almost entirely to tax collections that are now expected to be sharply lower because of slower-than-expected economic growth in the next few years. After an unexpected 2.9 percent drop in gross domestic product in the first quarter of this year, the White House lowered its forecast to 2.6 percent growth for the fiscal year. The administration had predicted 3.3 percent growth.\n\nOfficials at the Office of Management and Budget did not respond to requests for comment on the report, which was abruptly released Friday afternoon without the standard warnings to reporters.\n\nIn a blog post, Brian Deese, the acting budget director, highlighted the positive, noting that Obama has presided over \u201cthe most rapid sustained deficit reduction since World War II.\u201d\n\nWhen Obama took office in 2009, the economy was in free fall and the budget deficit was soaring toward $1.4 trillion, the first of four consecutive trillion-dollar deficits that drove the national debt to the highest level as a percentage of the economy since the end of World War II.\n\nThe economy has since improved, and Obama has signed off on painful but historic spending cuts under pressure from Republicans in Congress. Last year, the deficit was $680 billion. And after nearly three years of all-consuming budget battles, lawmakers heading into midterm elections have taken a break from the contentious work of deficit reduction \u2014 at least until next year, when deadlines loom on the debt limit and automatic agency budget cuts known as the sequester.\n\nDemocrats hailed Friday\u2019s White House deficit forecast, which came on the same day as a Treasury Department announcement that the government recorded a surplus of $71 billion for the month of June.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s report . . . shows once again that our fiscal outlook has improved significantly in the near-term,\u201d Senate Budget Committee Chairman Patty Murray (D-Wash.) said in a statement. \u201cWhile we need to continue to tackle long-term deficits fairly and responsibly, we have room to focus on other deficits in areas like jobs, innovation, infrastructure, and education.\u201d\n\nRepublicans, meanwhile, noted that the long-term outlook remains gloomy, with the national debt forecast to rise to more than $25 trillion by 2024 if Obama\u2019s policies are enacted.\n\nOn Friday, the debt stood at $17.6 trillion.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "business, deficit to fall below &u0024;600 billion", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Good news from review leavened by forecast of looming deficit increase due to slow economic growth.", "title": "Budget deficit to dip below $600 billion for first time since recession, White House predicts", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/deficit-to-dip-below-600-billion-for-first-time-since-recession-white-house-predicts/2014/07/11/50b2a26c-0931-11e4-a0dd-f2b22a257353_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2014/07/11/National-Economy/Images/Obama_Secret_Service-0104d-1702.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@loriamontgomery"}, "description": "Good news from review leavened by forecast of looming deficit increase due to slow economic growth.", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/deficit-to-dip-below-600-billion-for-first-time-since-recession-white-house-predicts/2014/07/11/50b2a26c-0931-11e4-a0dd-f2b22a257353_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "business, deficit to fall below &u0024;600 billion", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "eomportal-uuid": "50b2a26c-0931-11e4-a0dd-f2b22a257353"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcdc30\"", "article_summary": "The White House said Friday that the federal budget deficit will fall to $583 billion this year, the smallest deficit of President Obama\u2019s tenure and the first to dip below $600 billion since the Great Recession took hold in 2008.\nDemocrats hailed Friday\u2019s White House deficit forecast, which came on the same day as a Treasury Department announcement that the government recorded a surplus of $71 billion for the month of June.\nIn its midyear review of the nation\u2019s finances, the White House predicted that the deficit for the fiscal year that ends in September will be about $66 billion lower than the administration forecast in February.\nAfter an unexpected 2.9 percent drop in gross domestic product in the first quarter of this year, the White House lowered its forecast to 2.6 percent growth for the fiscal year.\nWhile the analysis brought good news for the short term, the outlook for the longer term was less rosy: The White House predicts that the nation\u2019s finances will deteriorate markedly over the next decade, with deficits rising nearly $600 billion above previous projections."}
