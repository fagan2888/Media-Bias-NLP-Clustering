An even higher percentage describe themselves as emotionally attached to Israel. For this we have one person to thank: King David.\n\nThe Israel we know today is a nation that David created virtually out of thin air. Before David, there were two territories, Israel to the north, and Judah to the south.\n\nBy sheer force of personality\u2014and, to be fair, substantial military strength\u2014David combined these two lands under a single crown (his). Not only had this never happened before; no one had ever thought of it before.\n\nAlthough the Bible makes it sound as if everyone loved David, and were desperate to follow him, this wasn\u2019t really the case. David took power by force.\n\nThe people of Israel and Judah became part of David\u2019s kingdom because he conquered them\u2014they had no choice in the matter. Their only option was to abandon the land that they had held for centuries. And in a tight real estate market\u2014every family believed that they had eternal rights to their property\u2014moving was pretty much out of the question.\n\nWe tend to think of Israel in biblical terms: the land promised to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, the land of the 12 tribes. These concepts were created in the wake of David\u2019s reign.\n\nEverywhere that the Bible speaks of Judah and Israel together\u2014the stories of the patriarchs, the Exodus, the conquest\u2014we encounter the ramifications of David\u2019s actions.\n\nThe borders of the modern state of Israel today are, roughly, David\u2019s borders, or at least those attributed to him by the biblical authors. (For the record: the West Bank was part of David\u2019s kingdom; the Gaza Strip was not.)\n\nAnd at the center of Israel, both ancient and modern, is the holy city of Jerusalem. This, too, is David\u2019s doing. Before David, Jerusalem was a long-standing independent city-state, belonging to a long-lost people called the Jebusites.\n\nMORE ON CNN: Why everyone fights over Jerusalem\n\nRecognizing that its central location would be perfect for the capital of his newly united state\u2014the ancient equivalent of Washington\u2014David conquered it and wiped out its former inhabitants.\n\nBecause David is credited with founding the Temple in Jerusalem\u2014although Solomon built the actual structure, David chose the site, set up an altar, and laid the conceptual groundwork\u2014it\u2019s natural enough to assume that there was some religious motivation at work.\n\nBut, in fact, David\u2019s aim in inaugurating a site of worship in his capital was more economical than spiritual. Temples were sites of commerce\u2014Jesus knew this\u2014and having a culturally significant relic, in the form of the Ark of the Covenant, was sure to draw the people in.\n\nEvery lamb sacrificed in Jerusalem meant profit for the sanctuary, and for the king who controlled it. Every pilgrim meant a night\u2019s stay in a local bed and breakfast (all fully taxable, of course).\n\nDavid used belief as a lure to draw in the masses. But he didn\u2019t care much what his people believed. The creation of the unified kingdom of Israel wasn\u2019t based on shared religion.\n\nThe inhabitants of the north had very different practices from those in the south. And none of them was following Jewish law\u2014the laws hadn\u2019t been written yet, and wouldn\u2019t be for centuries.\n\nWhat united the people of David\u2019s kingdom was, quite simply, that they lived there. It was a political state, not a religious one.\n\nIsrael then, like today, was primarily a political entity, and only secondarily a religious one. Those who considered themselves attached to Israel believed and practiced a whole range of things, or not; just like those who are attached to Israel today.\n\nA Pew poll released earlier this month demonstrates the continuing pull of David\u2019s Israel. Millions of American Jews financially support the modern state of Israel, either through donations or through tourism.\n\nMORE ON CNN: Study: American Jews losing their religion\n\nWe feel the pull of the land, the sanctity of the ancient streets of Jerusalem. We fly El Al, we stay at the hotels, we eat at the restaurants, we pay to enter various sites.\n\nThat is: We\u2019re still doing just what David wanted us to do. We are precisely the Jews who David envisioned\u2014believing whatever we want, just so long as we spend our money in Israel.\n\nJoel S.
