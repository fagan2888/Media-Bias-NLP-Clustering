You be the judge. Below is a transcript of a recent Federal Eye interview with the inspector general, covering topics that range from Obamacare and Healthcare.gov to Ebola and his most uncomfortable moment on Capitol Hill. We edited the transcript for length.\n\nWhat is most challenging about monitoring Health and Human Services?\n\nWhat\u2019s most challenging is both the magnitude and the complexity of what we deal with. It\u2019s very large. It\u2019s by far the largest department in the country financially. About a trillion dollars will run through the department this year, so that\u2019s as big as you get, considerably larger than even the Department of Defense. But it\u2019s also the complexity that comes with it. Health care, health insurance programs and the way they\u2019re financed, public health programs and the way they need to be delivered are relatively complex compared to most other aspects of public policy.\n\nWhat types of audits and investigations does your office do?\n\nOur audit services look at the way states operate their Medicaid programs to make sure they\u2019re following the federal Medicaid rules. They do a lot of auditing of hospitals around the country to ensure that hospitals are complying with the Medicare rules.\n\nHealth care is multifaceted. There\u2019s such an incredible variety of providers, physicians, nurses, pharmacies, pharmaceutical manufacturers. Virtually every aspect of health care is a risk area, and our investigators do a wide variety of investigations in virtually all of those fields.\n\nYou\u2019ve done some reports on states that gamed the Medicaid system. What did you find?\n\nWe have had issues with some of the states \u2014 the state of Pennsylvania on a tax issue and New York using the federal government Medicaid upper-payment limits in ways that we viewed as abusive. So there are a variety of schemes that occur within the Medicaid programs that violate, in our view, the federal rules. And it\u2019s a significant challenge to actually follow the Medicaid dollars, because you\u2019re dealing with 50 programs \u2014 since every state has its own program.\n\nDo you think states violate the rules intentionally? What is happening?\n\nIt does appear as if these are efforts designed to up the federal share \u2014 to alleviate state budgets and to maximize the federal contribution. There are rules of the road here when it comes to Medicaid, and the idea is that the federal government is supposed to share in costs, but at certain understood percentages, so that when the state operations try to game that, our auditors make recommendations to [Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services] to collect those dollars that shouldn\u2019t have been allocated.\n\nWhat kind of work has your office done with HealthCare.gov, the federal online insurance exchange that malfunctioned after it launched last year?\n\nWe have about 30 to 40 audits and evaluations in process to look at the exchanges, to look at the marketplaces. Work was started shortly after it went live last year, and we have gotten requests from both the department as well as from the Hill to do work on payment, on eligibility, on the contracts, on security issues. And the office has issued a couple of reports so far, specifically on the question of controls and the need for better security. And a series of reports we should be issuing, really within the next few weeks, on other aspects of Healthcare.gov. And we\u2019re continuing to monitor in this second phase.\n\nWhat issues did you find with controls and security?\n\nThat there was a need to strengthen those controls.\n\n\n\n(Evelyn Hockstein/For The Washington Post)\n\nWere the controls so weak that the public has reason to panic right now, or are these little tweaks that the government needs to make?\n\nThese are the kinds of reports that are designed to assist policy makers in understanding what needs to be strengthened.\n\nOne of your reports mentioned that HHS hired dozens of contractors and spent $800 million to build the HealthCare.gov site. Should it take that many contractors and that much money to build an insurance exchange?\n\nI don\u2019t believe we\u2019ve gotten into those specific questions.\n\nWith the Maryland health exchange, your office issued some subpoenas. Can you tell me where those investigations stand?\n\nI can\u2019t really talk about any specific investigation or audit, but we are looking at some state exchanges as well as federal exchanges. We\u2019re trying to broaden our reach so that we can look in both categories.\n\nCan you tell me what types of issues might warrant an investigation with the creation of exchanges?\n\nI wouldn\u2019t want to speculate.\n\nEveryone is concerned about whether the Affordable Care Act will slow down growth in health-care costs. Are you able to weigh in on that in your role as inspector general?\n\nWe really don\u2019t look at that kind of big picture question, but I think the whole notion of coming up with a coordinated-care model is designed to reduce dollars. And the science is so strong for a coordinated-care model that it\u2019s really not a question of whether you go back. It\u2019s a question of whether you make these new models work so that you begin to realize the cost savings that are supposed to come with them. I think that\u2019s going to take some time still to understand. We\u2019re kind of in the middle of that.\n\nHave you had any uncomfortable moments on the Hill?\n\nI think the most uncomfortable moment I had was when [former Sen. Max Baucus (D-Mont.)] repeatedly asked me to explain how much fraud there was in health care, as if there could be any particular dollar figure \u2014 as if somehow there is a way of being able to nail down that figure.\n\nWhat was your response?\n\nI could not give him a dollar figure, and he found it very frustrating. And I found it very frustrating to get the question asked repeatedly of me. Figures vary as they will, and it\u2019s often said in newspapers or magazines that it\u2019s a three- to ten-percent fraud percentage. Again, I think that it\u2019s a fool\u2019s errand to try to nail down a particular dollar figure. Our office over the last year, we have investigated in audit receivables almost $5 billion, much of that as a result of our fraud work. So, we can point to specific dollars, and it\u2019s been estimated by the Institute of Medicine that there\u2019s $75 billion of fraud nationwide in health care. If public-health programs are half of that, then you\u2019re looking at $35 billion to $40 billion.\n\nIs your office doing any work on Ebola issues?\n\nWe are in the process of exploring how we can do the right thing in terms of being able to be part of the whole evaluation of how that issue has unfolded here. We have been involved in emergency preparedness work before \u2014 work with [Hurricane] Katrina, with Super Storm Sandy, in fact we\u2019re still involved in some of that work. In this context, we\u2019re not first responders, so we haven\u2019t been at the front lines of this, and we don\u2019t want to get in the way of the program people. We have gotten some congressional requests, and we\u2019re working with the Hill, and we\u2019re working with the department to understand how we can do the important kind of program evaluation that we do with [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention].\n\nHow do you deal with differences between career professionals who are working on a report?\n\nIf there are internal different points of view within the office, they\u2019re actually solved by experts who are sitting at the table. I don\u2019t sit as a supreme court on these reports. We really don\u2019t get to that stage. Because this is a very technical field, and people bring expertise, we really try to operate as flatly as possible, so that people aren\u2019t thinking about a long chain of command. People who have prepared the material are sitting at the same desk as those whose signature is required to actually have the report issued. We expect to resolve these matters in a very collegial way.\n\nBut I imagine that people sometimes have irreconcilable differences \u2014 they feel that, in their professional minds, they just can\u2019t budge on an issue. What do you want your managers to do in those situations?\n\nThe important thing is actually to make sure that everyone gets a chance to be heard around a table and explain what their thinking is. So I think the most important role I play in that context is to ensure the integrity of process, because I can\u2019t be the expert in everything. I\u2019m expert in precious few things, actually. But I do need to be expert in ensuring that there\u2019s good process. The great thing about that is that it becomes exceedingly rare when then somebody feels like they still have a beef about it. If people really are given a fair chance to air their view, and you need to come down to one side or another, if there really has been a fair opportunity to explain your position, I don\u2019t find issues of the kind that you are describing linger.\n\nYou were appointed by President George W. Bush, and now you serve under President Obama. What differences have you noticed between the two administrations?\n\nI really don\u2019t think of what we do in terms of personality. I think in terms of the programs \u2014 the subject matter, the portfolios. Have they grown? Certainly in this administration, between the Recovery Act and the Affordable Care Act, we\u2019re operating on a much larger playing field. I came in shortly after passage of the law that included [Medicare] Part D.\n\nAt the time, that was big and all-consuming. Looking back, it was just a prologue to a really explosive portfolio. A lot of the issues have become so much larger. Even without the Affordable Care Act, the Baby Boomer generation started to enter Medicare in 2011. Creating a larger Medicare population alone would have created a significantly larger field, but when you add the Affordable Care Act, that creates such a larger foot print. I\u2019m just struck with how things have headed north over the last few years.\n\nCORRECTION: An earlier version of this transcript incorrectly indicated that Sen. Spencer Bachus (R-Ala.) had repeatedly asked Levinson to quantify the amount of fraud that occurs within the health-care system. The transcript has been corrected to show that former Sen.
