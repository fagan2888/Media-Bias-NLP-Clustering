(Associated Press photo/Bert Rein)\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 Jennifer Gratz said Monday she hopes that Abigail Fisher, a Texan whose case against a race-based university admission policy has been taken up by the U.S. Supreme Court, will keep refusing to buckle against the weight of liberal backlash.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s almost becoming less about Abbie (Fisher) and more about trying to intimidate others like her from speaking out,\u201d Gratz, who successfully fought race-based admission in her native state of Michigan, said in an interview from Florida. If it succeeds, Fisher\u2019s lawsuit against the University of Texas at Austin could determine the future of affirmative action at public colleges.\n\nAs Fisher\u2019s case reached the highest court in the land, schools far and wide, including several in Massachusetts, began piling on, paying lawyers unknown sums of money to help defend the Texas school\u2019s affirmative action policies. The court docket shows that lawyers have chimed in representing Harvard University, Tufts University, Amherst, Hampshire, Mt. Holyoke, Simmons, Smith, Wellesley and Williams colleges, in addition to Harvard Law School Dean Martha Minow. And that\u2019s just the Bay State contingent out of many powerful institutions fighting Fisher. Gratz may be the only other woman in America who can truly relate to her situation.\n\nShe too once faced similar odds.\n\nIn 1995, Gratz, who is white, blamed the implementation of race-based admission policies at the University of Michigan for putting her on the school\u2019s wait-list even as it admitted less-qualified minority students. Gratz had a 3.8 grade-point average and argued that the university\u2019s evaluation system unfairly discriminated against her in favor of minority applicants.\n\nUnder a 150-point system, 100 points were required to guarantee admission to the state-run school. At the time when Gratz applied, the school followed a policy that awarded minorities an automatic 20 points just for applying. A perfect Scholastic Aptitude Test, or SAT, score, by comparison, was worth only 12 points.\n\nIn 1997, Gratz sued the school, claiming she had been discriminated against. Her lawsuit, like Fisher\u2019s, eventually reached the nation\u2019s highest court. In 2003, the court ruled 6-3 that the university\u2019s affirmative action admission policy was unconstitutional and struck it down. However, it upheld the use of affirmative action by the law school.\n\nGratz later helped lead a movement that put the issue into the hands of Michigan voters as a ballot initiative. In 2006, nearly 60 percent supported banning affirmative action in admissions. The Supreme Court in April 2014 upheld the voters\u2019 decision in a 6-2 ruling, spelling an end to the state\u2019s practice of granting preferential treatment based on race, gender, ethnicity or nationality.\n\nAs Fisher\u2019s challenge to similar policies at the University of Texas has entered the headlines, Gratz has watched the vilification of the plaintiff from afar.\n\n\u201cAbigail Fisher deserves an \u2018F\u2019 for her race-baiting Supreme Court case aimed at boosting subpar white students,\u201d declared a Salon.com headline on what appears to be a conventional report and not an editorial that the website published earlier this month.\n\n\u201cAbigail Fisher needs to get on with her life,\u201d Houston Chronicle columnist Lisa Falkenberg wrote last August in an opinion piece.\n\nFisher, who graduated from a suburban Houston high school with a 3.59 grade-point average albeit with a mediocre 1,180 SAT score, eventually enrolled at Louisiana State University and graduated in 2012.\n\nLike Gratz, who attended the University of Michigan-Dearborn, not the Ann Arbor-based school that put her on its wait list, Fisher did not drop her lawsuit against the discriminatory policy she encountered.\n\nYet unlike Gratz, Fisher\u2019s case has not only attracted media attention, but also social-media trolls.\n\n\u201cSocial media wasn\u2019t really around during my case and the 2006 vote,\u201d Gratz noted. \u201cBut it looks like it\u2019s making everything a little worse for her.\u201d\n\n#StayMadAbby\n\n#StayMadAbby: Black Graduates Slam Abigail Fisher For The Race-Baiter She Is [Photos] https://t.co/HoRcBVAdZ7 \u2014 ALEA (@eyeamsincere) Dec. 12, 2015\n\nIt was last week when the Twitter hashtag #StayMadAbby took off, just as another round of discussions on the issue began at the Supreme Court. The hashtag grew from a trend to a phenomenon. A massive piling-on ensued. Fisher was accused of being everything from a race-baiter and a poster child of white entitlement to merely a poor student.\n\nBut Fisher doesn\u2019t appear to have a Twitter account. The only one bearing her name appears to be satirical, Stay Mad Abby.\n\nGratz said her chief concern is what effect that the avalanche of online public mockery and intimidation may have on the next person who dares to challenge race-based preferences.\n\n\u201cThe issue has become less about promoting diversity and more about trying to intimidate others you don\u2019t agree with,\u201d she said. \u201cNow you\u2019ve got people calling her names and ripping her to shreds.\u201d\n\nGratz added that she sees a lot of irony in the way people are reacting to Fisher and her lawsuit and the way media outlets are covering it.\n\n\u201cLet me get this straight \u2013 people are going after her in the name of diversity,\u201d Gratz noted. \u201cSo what about diversity of thought? There doesn\u2019t appear to be any.\u201d\n\nGratz pointed out that while she never had to deal with the fevered scrutiny of a social-media mob, she did receive her fair share of abuse during the 2006 ballot initiative campaign in Michigan.\n\n\u201cI got spit on once,\u201d Gratz said. \u201cPeople said awful things to me.\u201d\n\nGiven the chance, however, Gratz said she\u2019d \u201cdo it all over again\u201d when asked about her court and campaign battles.\n\nThese days, however, she\u2019s staying out of the limelight.\n\nAn organization she launched named the XIV Foundation, dedicated to promoting the 14th Amendment\u2019s equal protection clause, is currently on hiatus. Gratz said she had to turn her attention away and \u201ctake a few steps back\u201d to help care for her brother, who is battling cancer.\n\nThe organization, according to its mission statement, is also dedicated to \u201ctelling the untold stories of those who are harmed by race-based policies.\u201d\n\nGratz said she plans to resume her activism.\n\nOn Monday one of her most recent initiatives marked a two-year anniversary of sorts. In October 2013, Gratz was invited to Ann Arbor by the University of Michigan\u2019s student chapter of the Young Americans for Liberty, a national collegiate organization dedicated to defending individual rights to life, property and freedoms granted by the Constitution, to lead a presentation entitled \u201cDiversity in Race vs. Diversity in Ideas: The Michigan Affirmative Action Debate.\u201d\n\nThe Young Americans for Liberty, however, were denied $1,000 from a student activities fund to cover the costs of the event. School officials said using the fund for political events wasn\u2019t permitted.\n\nA couple of months later, on Dec. 21 of that year, the youth organization sued the university. About six months later, the group won a settlement in which the school agreed to fork over $5,000 in damages and $9,000 to cover legal costs.\n\n\u201cWhat it showed me is that the University of Michigan still doesn\u2019t recognize diversity in thought,\u201d Gratz said. \u201cThey paid for all of those court cases to fight it.\u201d\n\nContact Evan Lips at [email protected] or on Twitter at @evanmlips.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.", "article_metadata": {"shareaholic": {"site_name": "NewBostonPost", "language": "en-US", "url": "http://newbostonpost.com/2015/12/21/a-veteran-of-race-based-preference-fight-voices-support-for-texan/", "article_author_name": "Evan Lips", "image": "http://newbostonpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Abigail_Fisher-e1453914570900.jpg", "site_id": "ab905d8abdbd23a369259b08e0927728", "shareable_page": "true", "keywords": "affirmative action, backlash, civil rights issues, education, Massachusetts, Michigan, Texas, U.S. Supreme Court, University of Michigan, University of Texas"}, "description": "Jennifer Gratz said Monday she hopes that Abigail Fisher, a Texan whose case against a race-based university admission policy has been taken up by the U.S.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"image": "http://newbostonpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Abigail_Fisher-e1453914570900.jpg"}, "keywords": "affirmative action,texas,backlash,civil rights issues,education,massachusetts,michigan,u.s. supreme court,university of michigan,university of texas", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "A veteran of race-based preference fight voices support for TexanPrinted from: http://newbostonpost.com/2015/12/21/a-veteran-of-race-based-preference-fight-voices-support-for-texan/Abigail Fisher speaks to reporters outside the U.S. Supreme Court in Washington.\n\u201cLet me get this straight \u2013 people are going after her in the name of diversity,\u201d Gratz noted.\nIf it succeeds, Fisher\u2019s lawsuit against the University of Texas at Austin could determine the future of affirmative action at public colleges.\nIn 2003, the court ruled 6-3 that the university\u2019s affirmative action admission policy was unconstitutional and struck it down.\nIn 2006, nearly 60 percent supported banning affirmative action in admissions."}
