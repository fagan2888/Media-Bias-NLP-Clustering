The comedian rallied voters for President Obama during the 2012 election. He\u2019s a co-founder of Funny Or Die, the viral video site that\u2019s increasingly published political humor, like a Dear Abby response to the State of Arizona with regard to a law that would let businesses refuse to serve LGBT customers, or zingers to call the singer and gun regulation opponent Ted Nugent, and which signed up to help the Obama administration promote health care reform. And as an actor Ferrell has a decided taste for parts that tweak accepted ideas about what makes a man a man.\n\nBut apparently, Ferrell\u2019s politics still came as a surprise to some of his fans. On Monday, he published a photo of himself on his Facebook page, holding a sign with the \u201c#GetCovered\u201d hashtag the White House has been using to encourage people to sign up for health insurance coverage. The post has racked up more than 20,000 likes of this writing, but it\u2019s also prompted reactions from readers who seem to have missed the text and subtext of Ferrell\u2019s career that range from surprised to outraged.\n\n\u201cPhony liberal sell-out,\u201d grumbled one reader. \u201cThe truth about ObamaCare is Higher Taxes and Costs; Government rationing of health care; & interfering with the Doctor/Patient relationship. The quality of heath care and our Freedom and Liberty have been compromised. Shame on you Will Ferrell !!\u201d\n\nThe incident is a reminder just how wide the range of celebrity advocacy efforts are, and the very different ways in which those efforts can rebound to famous people\u2019s benefit, or cost. It\u2019s absolutely admirable for George Clooney to be deeply involved in genocide prevention work, or for Matt Damon to devote as much time as he does to efforts to secure clean water supplies for some of the world\u2019s poorest people, a push that involved a memorable appearance on Entourage. And though the engagements can be fleeting, I have no objection to actors using their campaigns for Academy Awards to draw attention to the issues that their films touch on, as Bradley Cooper did last year while promoting Silver Linings Playbook.\n\nBut as much as all of these causes involve time, and in some cases, physical risk\u2013Clooney contracted malaria in Sudan in 2011\u2013the causes they\u2019ve chosen don\u2019t require them to expend much in the way of their brands or capital. The idea that genocide is bad is uncontroversial, even if Washington policymakers struggle to determine the correct course of action in some of the places Clooney visits. It would be the height of churlishness to suggest that people don\u2019t deserve clean water. And, even if it\u2019s difficult to push through better funding for mental health care, no one\u2019s going to attack a movie star for suggesting that ill people deserve treatment.\n\nIf picking a cause is an important part of the celebrity portfolio, picking a candidate or a policy can be a higher-risk endeavor. While fans may be able to align nearly any humanitarian or charitable endeavor with their hazy idea of a star\u2019s politics and character, hitting the campaign trail, or advocating for a policy eliminates that ambiguity fairly rapidly. This may not be the first time Ferrell\u2019s aligned himself with the Obama administration\u2013the same day he posted the picture, the White House released a video of Ferrell and the First Lady conducting a focus group about healthy living. But his politics were clearly new to some of his followers.\n\nThe cost to Ferrell probably won\u2019t be particularly painful. Previous hints of liberalism didn\u2019t actually stop Anchorman 2 from cleaning up at the box office, and his expressed liberalism is hardly some sort of radical departure from perceived Hollywood orthodoxy. But Ferrell\u2019s willingness to step forward and make himself clear is a reminder of just how different the various forms of celebrity advocacy can be. By asking his followers to take action on a policy that\u2019s kicked up a considerable fuss here at home, Ferrell\u2019s accepting that he might rile up some of his previously contented fans. That\u2019s a different kind of courage than it takes to venture far from home, at risk to your person if not to your brand. But just because politics has a more dented halo than humanitarian work doesn\u2019t mean it doesn\u2019t require bravery.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "Will Ferrell's liberalism shouldn't come as a surprise.
