The Chiefs are on to New England or Denver.

Kansas City beat Houston 30-0 on the road for its 11th straight win to advance to the AFC divisional round. Andy Reid and the Chiefs now have to wait a few hours to find out their next opponent.

If the Bengals beat the Steelers in the night game, the Chiefs will play Denver for the third time this season. They beat the Broncos on the road 29-13 in Week 10. The Broncos won in Kansas City, 31-24, in Week Two.

If the Steelers win, the Chiefs will visit the Patriots.

The Chiefs last played New England in 2014. They beat up on Tom Brady in a 41-14 victory.

Kansas City overcame a 1-5 start and won the final 10 regular-season games.
