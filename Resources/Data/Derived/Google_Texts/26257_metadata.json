Hiding the debates is allegedly a plot to help the well-known Hillary Clinton, who, like all front-runners, isn\u2019t eager to give her opponents any extra exposure. And indeed there was at least one well-known political junkie who didn\u2019t bother to watch: Barack Obama.\n\nObama was on vacation in Hawaii, playing a round at the Kaneohe Klipper Golf Course, while Clinton, Bernie Sanders, and Martin O\u2019Malley spent two hours in New Hampshire debating what each would do as his replacement. If Obama was conspicuously uninterested in what the three candidates had to say, the feeling was mutual. Astonishingly, Barack Obama, the first African-American President, one re\u00eblected with a comfortable four-point margin and whose approval rating among Democrats remains in the eighties, was mentioned by the candidates just four times\u2014once by O\u2019Malley and three times by Clinton.\n\nWhen Obama was mentioned, it was generally in passing. While delivering an attack on Clinton, O\u2019Malley noted that she had a different position on guns when she ran against Obama, in 2008. When asked about a pledge not to raise taxes on Americans making more than two hundred thousand dollars a year, Clinton said that Obama had made the same pledge. Her second mention of Obama was relatively positive. \u201cI think that we need to build on the work of the policing commissioner that President Obama impanelled,\u201d she said, after being asked about criminal-justice reform. Her final mention of the President was about how crucial it is that she replace him. \u201cI know how important it is that we have a Democrat succeed President Obama in the White House,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cAnd I will do all that I can in this campaign to reach out and explain what I stand for and what I will do as President.\u201d\n\nThe White House spent the last week before Obama left for vacation aggressively making the case that Obama\u2019s second term has been historically significant, and that 2015 was a year filled with accomplishments. White House aides and Obama himself held private briefings for the press pushing this message, and Obama capped it off with a press conference, on Friday afternoon, at which he bragged about his successes this year: the unemployment rate reduced to five per cent, wages growing, a record number of Americans with health insurance, health-care inflation in check, a major climate agreement negotiated in Paris, a nuclear deal made with Iran, improved relations with Cuba, marriage equality legalized in every state, and a bipartisan budget deal. On his most challenging national-security issue, Obama insisted that America was \u201csqueezing ISIL \u2019s heart,\u201d in Syria and Iraq to \u201cmake it harder for them to pump their terror and propaganda to the rest of the world.\u201d\n\nThe Democrats running for President, especially Clinton, seem to have missed Obama\u2019s press conference. On the economy, Clinton stressed what was wrong rather than what Obama had fixed. \u201cAt the center of my economic policy is raising incomes,\u201d she said, \u201cbecause people haven\u2019t been able to get ahead, and the cost of everything, from college tuition to prescription drugs, has gone up.\u201d\n\nWhen asked about the Affordable Care Act, Clinton quickly cited two aspects of the law that were successful, and then moved on to the ways she would improve it. She did not mention that Obama had just signed into law a delay in the so-called Cadillac tax on high-cost insurance plans, a policy she had previously argued was one of the crucial ways in which she would amend the A.C.A.\n\nOn foreign policy, Clinton distanced herself even more from Obama. As she has in the past, she noted that Obama rejected her advice on what to do about Syria when the civil war there first started. \u201cI advocated arming the moderate opposition back in the day when I was still Secretary of State, because I worried we would end up exactly where we are now,\u201d Clinton said. Her suggestion seemed to be that if Obama had listened to her, the current situation would not be nearly as dire, an argument Obama has said is a \u201cfantasy.\u201d\n\nIn another subtle rebuke to Obama, who has been heavily criticized for stating earlier this month that ISIS had been \u201ccontained,\u201d Clinton said, \u201cI have a plan that I\u2019ve put forward to go after ISIS . Not to contain them, but to defeat them.\u201d It was a particularly uncharitable distinction to make, considering that the President\u2019s comment about ISIS being \u201ccontained\u201d was in the very specific context of the group\u2019s geographic growth in Iraq and Syria. Moreover, Clinton\u2019s plan to defeat ISIS is little different than Obama\u2019s, with the exception of her call for a no-fly zone, the practical benefits of which are dubious.\n\nFinally, Clinton talked about American leadership in a way that had an awfully familiar ring if you\u2019ve been watching the Republican debates. Clinton oddly took credit for a United Nations Security Council resolution on Syria, which Secretary of State John Kerry helped secure on Friday. \u201cNow that Russia has joined us in the Security Council, has adopted an agreement that we hashed out a long day in Geneva three years ago, now I think we can have those conversations,\u201d she said, without giving any credit to Obama or Kerry.\n\nLater on in the debate, she returned to the subject and suggested, just as many Republicans do, that Obama has failed to show American leadership. \u201cAnd we finally have a U.N. Security Council Resolution bringing the world together to go after a political transition in Syria. If the United States does not lead, there is not another leader. There is a vacuum. And we have to lead, if we\u2019re going to be successful.\u201d Perhaps this was just a generic statement about American leadership and not actually an implicit criticism of Obama. But it seemed to have an accusatory tone, and it accords with what is known about how Clinton and those around her privately assess Obama\u2019s foreign-policy record.\n\nAny candidate trying to replace a member of her own party as President runs into the issue of how to grapple with the current occupant\u2019s record. There is a natural tension between Obama\u2019s interest in polishing his legacy and emphasizing every achievement in his final months in office and Clinton\u2019s strategic need to respond to the real problems that voters face. But if the balance gets too out of whack, Clinton risks running a campaign that seems more like a repudiation of Obama than one that defines her as his natural heir.\n\nPerhaps things would be better if the candidates watched Obama\u2019s press conferences and Obama watched their debates.", "article_metadata": {"cache-version": 20160526204643, "description": "Ryan Lizza writes about what the candidates did and did not say about President Obama during the Democratic Presidential debate.", "account-url": "https://account.newyorker.com", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1081530898", "og": {"site_name": "The New Yorker", "description": "Hillary Clinton\u2019s final mention of President Obama during the debate was about how crucial it is that she replace him.", "title": "Hillary vs. Barack, Round LXXXVIII - The New Yorker", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://www.newyorker.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Lizza-Hillary-vs-Barack-Round-LXXXVIII-1200x630-1450643603.jpg", "height": 630}, "updated_time": "2015-12-20T17:59:14-04:00", "url": "http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/hillary-clinton-obama-democratic-debate", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Hillary Clinton\u2019s final mention of President Obama was about how crucial it is that she replace him.", "title": "Hillary vs. Barack, Round LXXXVIII - The New Yorker", "image": "http://www.newyorker.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Lizza-Hillary-vs-Barack-Round-LXXXVIII-1200x630-1450643603.jpg", "creator": "@RyanLizza", "site": "@newyorker", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "The New Yorker", "robots": "noodp", "parsely-metadata": "{\"id\":\"3149844\",\"title_alt\":\"Hillary vs. Barack, Round LXXXVIII\",\"featured_image_url\":\"http:\\/\\/www.newyorker.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2015\\/12\\/Lizza-Hillary-vs-Barack-Round-LXXXVIII-728x375-1450643666.jpg\"}", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "environment": "prod", "wp-parsely_version": "1.7", "fb": {"admins": 757909316}, "google-site-verification": "_jvLA9pRQom0-f6587wRKrNwfRtqyKzjfYWvwcZ5fxc", "article": {"section": "News Desk", "tag": "Republicans", "published_time": "2015-12-20T15:35:32-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-12-20T17:59:14-04:00"}, "HandheldFriendly": "true", "id": 3149844, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=0", "news_keywords": "Barack Obama, bernie sanders, debate, Election 2016, Hillary Clinton, Martin O\u2019Malley, Republicans"}, "article_summary": "\u201cI think that we need to build on the work of the policing commissioner that President Obama impanelled,\u201d she said, after being asked about criminal-justice reform.\n\u201cI know how important it is that we have a Democrat succeed President Obama in the White House,\u201d Clinton said.\nPerhaps things would be better if the candidates watched Obama\u2019s press conferences and Obama watched their debates.\nAnd indeed there was at least one well-known political junkie who didn\u2019t bother to watch: Barack Obama.\nHiding the debates is allegedly a plot to help the well-known Hillary Clinton, who, like all front-runners, isn\u2019t eager to give her opponents any extra exposure."}
