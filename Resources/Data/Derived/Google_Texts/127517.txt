This afternoon, most of us should see a break from the rain for a few hours. This is a very strong and slow moving system that could redevelop some showers tonight. Anything that does redevelop should be gone by the time we head to work on Monday.

We are looking at 1 to 3‚Äù of rain possible across much of Green Country, some locally higher amounts will be possible. Once this system moves out, we still warmer than normal day time highs. Tuesday will be our warmest day of the week, topping out in the mid-60s.

A stronger cold front arrives by Wednesday morning and then day time highs drop back to near normal for the middle of December.
