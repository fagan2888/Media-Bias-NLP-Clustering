How the Chamber beat the tea party in 2014\n\nAfter the 2012 election, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce\u2019s top political adviser, Scott Reed, surveyed the damage \u2013 tens of millions of dollars spent only to lose the White House and a slew of winnable Senate races \u2014 and vowed that 2014 would be different.\n\nSome $70 million and a Republican wave later, the business lobby, one of the biggest spenders in the midterm elections, is feeling very good about its return on investment. Its conclusion after 2012 \u2014 that they had to take on tea party challengers in primaries and create a more business-friendly slate of general election candidates who could compete with Democrats \u2014 has been validated by Tuesday night\u2019s results, Chamber brass say.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u201cWe went into this realizing that candidates matter,\u201d Reed said in an interview shortly before the election.\n\n( POLITICO's 2014 race ratings)\n\nThe Chamber\u2019s first big test of the election cycle was a Nov. 2013 special congressional election in Alabama. It was a classic establishment-tea party matchup. Bradley Byrne checked all the Chamber\u2019s boxes: longtime business attorney, active in Mobile business circles, state senator, ex-chancellor of the state school system.\n\nHis opponent, Dean Young, was precisely the kind of candidate the Republican establishment was determined to root out. A real estate investor with a penchant for fire-breathing rhetoric, he had said that he was \u201cagainst homosexuals pretending like they\u2019re married\u201d and remarked that he believed President Barack Obama was born in Kenya.\n\nThe Chamber spent about $200,000 to boost Byrne, an appreciable sum for a single House race. But a Republican poll just before the election showed Young narrowly ahead.\n\nByrne eked out a 5-point win.\n\n( Polling Center: Current polls)\n\n\u201cAlabama was kind of critical,\u201d Reed said. The Chamber saw a potentially winning combination: a strong candidate in Byrne, along with a local Chamber of Commerce that could help the national group navigate the race.\n\n\u201cThese local Chambers give us eyes and ears that no other local organization has,\u201d Reed said. Chamber officials also told other outside groups like Crossroards, the Karl Rove-affiliated network, to keep out, believing they themselves were better messengers.\n\nThe victory gave the group a road map for the remainder of the cycle. Officials saw a way to not only bolster establishment candidates in primaries, but realized their efforts could make it harder for tea party-aligned groups to recruit formidable candidates.\n\n( WATCH: 2014 in 90 seconds)\n\nNext came Florida and a special House election to succeed the late Republican Rep. Bill Young in a St. Petersburg-area swing district that Obama carried twice. The March race was a chance for each party to set the narrative for the fall midterms. Democrats were high on Alex Sink, who was well known after narrowly losing a 2010 bid for Florida governor. Republicans fielded David Jolly, a longtime Young aide-turned-lobbyist.\n\nThe Chamber aired the first of what would become a succession of ads throughout the primary season featuring big-name endorsers. This one featured former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush.\n\nThe ad, according to Reed and the Chamber\u2019s political director Rob Engstrom, stayed on air for six weeks because it tested so well.\n\n( WATCH: Worst campaigns of 2014)\n\nIt was followed by a spot slamming Sink for backing Obamacare, a message the Chamber plastered throughout the district.\n\n\u201cWith Alex Sink, the priority is Obamacare, not us,\u201d a narrator intoned.\n\nThe idea was to combine a surgical message with a messenger trusted by local residents. In the district, some 70 percent of people voted early or by absentee ballot. Heading into Election Day, some Republicans were adamant that the race was lost, and questioned the focus on Obamacare.\n\n( PLAYBACK: Best of 2014)\n\nBut Jolly prevailed, and a new template was set. The Chamber would get involved early and actively, in primaries and special elections.\n\n\u201cWe learned that there\u2019s no such thing as Election Day anymore,\u201d Engstrom said. \u201cIt\u2019s more like election year.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe goal was increasing a pro-business majority in the House,\u201d Engstrom added. \u201cThe thing that we learned in Alabama, as well as through the primaries, is the composition of those majorities matter as much as the majorities themselves.\u201d\n\nThe group went on to win 14 out of 15 primaries in which it backed a candidate. But nowhere did the Chamber play a more crucial role than in Mississippi. It spent $1.2 million, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, to shore up Sen. Thad Cochran, who faced a strong challenge from tea party favorite Chris McDaniel.\n\nLooking for creative ways to reach voters, the group aired an ad featuring a bearded Brett Favre endorsing Cochran.\n\nIt was alternately billed as a \u201cHail Mary\u201d and a \u201cfourth-quarter\u201d ad. Either way, it broke through.\n\nThe Chamber ran about 80 ads in about 45 House and Senate districts throughout the election cycle. The group\u2019s stable of ad-makers includes Mike Murphy, a longtime Jeb Bush adviser, and Matt Leonardo.\n\nThe group also made some unconventional moves, including enlisting politicians not naturally associated with the Chamber. The most prominent example was Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) to help appeal to libertarian voters in several states.\n\nThe Chamber, traditionally aligned with Republicans, also endorsed a half-dozen Democrats in House races. One was San Diego-area Rep. Scott Peters, who was declared the winner Friday night in a hard-fought race against Republican Carl DeMaio, a former San Diego city councilman.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "The business lobby, one of the biggest spenders in the midterm elections, is feeling very good.", "title": "How the Chamber beat the tea party in 2014", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2014/11/chamber-of-commerce-tea-party-2014-112708.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2014/06/25/140624_thad_cochran_win_ap_605x328.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Elections,U.S. Chamber Of Commerce,Tea Party,2014 Elections", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "The business lobby, one of the biggest spenders in the midterm elections, is feeling very good.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "The Chamber spent about $200,000 to boost Byrne, an appreciable sum for a single House race.\nHow the Chamber beat the tea party in 2014After the 2012 election, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce\u2019s top political adviser, Scott Reed, surveyed the damage \u2013 tens of millions of dollars spent only to lose the White House and a slew of winnable Senate races \u2014 and vowed that 2014 would be different.\nThe Chamber saw a potentially winning combination: a strong candidate in Byrne, along with a local Chamber of Commerce that could help the national group navigate the race.\nThe Chamber ran about 80 ads in about 45 House and Senate districts throughout the election cycle.\nThe Chamber aired the first of what would become a succession of ads throughout the primary season featuring big-name endorsers."}
