The average college GPA has risen over the past few decades from 2.3 to 3.2, according to Gallup.\n\nThe compromised value of a high GPA has little impact on students from highly selective, well known colleges who are likely to land a job regardless of their GPA. But it has hurt hard-working students at schools without a marquee name, says Robert Benjamin, executive director of the nonprofit Council for Aid to Education, which administers the CLA+.\n\n\u201cThis gives able students at those schools an opportunity to show that their skills are the same or better than [those of] their counterparts,\u201d Benjamin says. \u201cIt also allows those schools to objectively demonstrate they have quality students.\u201d\n\nRELATED: WHAT\u2019S THE VALUE OF A COLLEGE EDUCATION?\n\nAnd here\u2019s another benefit: The test could be a way for students who take massive open online courses (MOOCs) to compete with those wielding pricey degrees.\n\nCRITICAL SKILLS IN A NEW ECONOMY\n\nThe $35, 90-minute, all-essay test measures critical thinking, analytical reasoning, and writing skills. (See a sample problem here.) The tests are graded on a 1600-point scale, and test takers can include their scores on their resume. Employers will be able to verify those scores.\n\nMore than half of employers say that most applicants who apply for positions at their companies don\u2019t have the skills and knowledge necessary for advancement, according to a study by the Association of American Colleges and Universities. The study also found that 93 percent of employers said a candidate\u2019s demonstrated capacity to think critically, communicate clearly, and solve complex problems is more important than his or her major.\n\nJim Oddo, vice president of talent acquisition and development for the telephone company Frontier Communications, is not familiar with the CLA+ test, but says hiring managers could use an objective measurement to compare applicants across the country.\n\n\u201cThat would be helpful for us,\u201d he says. \u201cA GPA is really only one tool that we consider, but we don\u2019t put a tremendous amount of weight on it. Your success here is more about how well you\u2019re going to fit into our culture. These new assessment tools might be better indicators of future behavior.\u201d\n\nFor now, Oddo says the company relies on its internship program and thorough interviewing and vetting to determine whether a new grad might be a good fit. \u201cIt\u2019s a challenge because you\u2019re making a commitment and taking a chance on someone who doesn\u2019t have a significant body of experience.\u201d\n\nTHE ROI OF A COLLEGE DEGREE\n\nThe CLA+ test comes amid mounting questions about the value of college degrees. There\u2019s a growing backlash against skyrocketing tuition costs and student debt, while young college grads face intractably high unemployment rates. The Obama administration has proposed ranking schools based on tuition, student debt, subsequent earnings of graduates, and the percentage of lower-income students who graduate.\n\nRELATED: STATES SLASH HIGHER EDUCATION BUDGETS AGAIN\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s imperative for employers to determine whether a potential hire is ready for the challenges of a dynamic workplace,\u201d says Michael Poliakoff, vice president of the American Council of Trustees and Alumni. \u201cThe CLA+ is designed to do exactly that.\u201d\n\nCLA+ is the only exit exam aimed specifically at college students right now, but experts say this testing market could soon get crowded as other organizations develop initiatives that reflect employers\u2019 demand for objective ways to measure students. Education Testing Services now lets job applicants send their GRE test scores to potential employers; and the ACT currently offers a Career Readiness Certificate, aimed at skilled technical workers.\n\n\u201cEmployers are telling us, \u2018I\u2019m hiring people who seem to have the right degree, but I don\u2019t know what their true workplace skills are,\u2019\u201d says ACT spokeswoman Katie Wacker. \u201c\u2019I don\u2019t know if they\u2019re going to be able to do the tasks I need them to do.\u2019\u201d\n\nThis piece was updated on Sept. 13. 2013.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "More than 200 colleges, including some in the Texas and California state systems, have signed on to offer their students the new voluntary Collegiate Learning Assessment Plus (CLA+) test, which is designed to give employers an objective way to measure entry-level candidates.", "title": "The New Test for Grads That Could Get Them a Job", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2013/09/09/New-Test-Grads-Could-Get-Them-Job", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/092222011_Lost_Graduate_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2013/09/09/New-Test-Grads-Could-Get-Them-Job", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/092222011_Lost_Graduate_article.jpg", "creator": "@bethbrav", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "More than 200 colleges, including some in the Texas and California state systems, have signed on to offer their students the new voluntary Collegiate Learning Assessment Plus (CLA+) test, which is designed to give employers an objective way to measure entry-level candidates.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "The average college GPA has risen over the past few decades from 2.3 to 3.2, according to Gallup.\nEducation Testing Services now lets job applicants send their GRE test scores to potential employers; and the ACT currently offers a Career Readiness Certificate, aimed at skilled technical workers.\nCRITICAL SKILLS IN A NEW ECONOMYThe $35, 90-minute, all-essay test measures critical thinking, analytical reasoning, and writing skills.\nJim Oddo, vice president of talent acquisition and development for the telephone company Frontier Communications, is not familiar with the CLA+ test, but says hiring managers could use an objective measurement to compare applicants across the country.\nThere\u2019s a growing backlash against skyrocketing tuition costs and student debt, while young college grads face intractably high unemployment rates."}
