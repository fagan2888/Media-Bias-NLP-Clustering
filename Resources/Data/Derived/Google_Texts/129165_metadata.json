According to GovTrack, 234 laws were enacted because of the Noble 113th.

It is very, very bottom-heavy.\n\nDespite taking off -- er, not being in session -- for months at a time, Congress still managed to hold votes and reshape the country, a little. Congratulations to the 535-plus people that made it happen.\n\n* An update! GovTrack looked at bills that the president is expected to sign, and this Congress may squeak into second place on the all-time least productive list.
