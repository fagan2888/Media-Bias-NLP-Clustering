You don\u2019t know what you\u2019re going to get out of it, but you\u2019re going to feel something.\u201d\n\nPeter Baggenstos, the owner of that quote, certainly felt something at Tribal Council on this week\u2019s episode of Survivor: Ka\u00f4h R\u014dng, and it was akin to a piranha bite to the backside. Despite a seemingly safe position within the numbers on paper, what with his place on the Gondol tribe alongside two of his former fellow Brains, Aubry Bracco and Joe del Campo, Peter became the sixth person eliminated from Ka\u00f4h R\u014dng, thanks to the combined powers of Brawn baller Scot Pollard and the Beauty bunch of Tai Trang and Julia Sokolowski.\n\nIt was Aubry who delivered the fatal blow, originally casting her vote for Julia, then crossing the 18-year-old college student\u2019s name out in favor of Peter, presumably to avoid a tie and subsequent rock draw. But that only happened after Peter himself attempted to blindside Joe and Aubry alongside the other Gondols, only for the plan to unravel hours before Tribal.\n\nHere\u2019s what Peter has to say about his attempts to take out the Brains, how he feels about the way he came off on television, the many medical situations this season (including one of his own), the President Obama comparisons, and even a trip down memory lane to his high school proms \u2014 plural. But first, Peter has a question for me\u2026\n\nPeter, what\u2019s going on?\n\n\n\nJosh! What\u2019s up, buddy? First, do you have any comic book recommendations?\n\n\n\nOh, wow! Look at you!\n\n\n\nI\u2019m looking for space opera. Something like Cowboy Bebop, which is anime, but also like Firefly. What do you have for me?\n\nSpace opera? That\u2019s tough off the top of my head, but I have a great sci-fi recommendation. It\u2019s called Y: The Last Man. If you\u2019re into sci-fi\u2026\n\n\u2026I am. I\u2019m typing this out right now.\n\nIt takes place in a world where every man on Earth dies except for one man and his male monkey companion. They have to figure out why all the men have suddenly died.\n\n\n\nWhy would he want to figure it out? Wouldn\u2019t he be like, \u201cYES!\u201d\n\n\n\nWell, there\u2019s times where he\u2019s like that! But then there are other times where he\u2019s aggressively hunted down because he\u2019s the only person left with a male chromosome. This is up your alley if you\u2019re looking for good sci-fi.\n\n\n\n[Wigler\u2019s Note: Should have recommended Saga, written by the same author as Y: The Last Man. Both comics are decidedly NSFW.]\n\nSo, you\u2019ve done your research on me. You know I\u2019m a nerd.\n\nI appreciate that about you, by the way.\n\nWell, since you know so much about me, I feel like I should know more about you. What happened on your prom night?\n\n\n\nI took two girls to prom. [Laughs] And nothing \u2014 absolutely nothing! \u2013 happened. There were [two schools] in my town in Montana. I went to my catholic school prom, and I knew a girl at the public school prom, so\u2026 it was back-to-back, not the same night, but there was overlap. But at the end of the day, nothing happened, which was consistent with my high school career.\n\nSo you felt something, and that something was\u2026 embarrassment?\n\n\n\nAnticipation and embarrassment. The best thing I got that night was a Jolly Rancher.\n\nLet\u2019s talk Survivor. As soon as the Brains took out Liz, you started talking mutiny. In this episode, you\u2019re aiming for Aubry and Joe, at least until the interrogation. Was it pure and straightforward revenge, or did you just not see yourself being able to work with them anymore moving down the road?\n\nYou know, it\u2019s a difficult question. After Liz left, I felt worse than a second class player. My first response after Liz left was, \u201cGreat, she\u2019s gone, not me.\u201d But the way my mind was working, it felt like there was ultimate disrespect, that they were only keeping me around for their own self-preservation, because I\u2019m good in challenges and I can do those things. They weren\u2019t keeping me around and treating me like a human with values and purpose, but as a tool.\n\nDuring the swap, I wanted to get them out because they really put me on the side. What\u2019s more frustrating was, this wasn\u2019t shown \u2014 and we\u2019re not live, so I can be more honest and cuss and all that stuff \u2014 when I got voted out, I had to get surgery on my hand and my back. My right hand had a big infection \u2014 deep. I was opening coconuts for Joe and I felt like a slave doing crap for him. He wanted me to work with him, but I was like, \u201cYou guys are treating me like crap, just because I was in an alliance with Liz.\u201d\n\nWhen we swapped, right when we got out there, they started this dialogue that I\u2019m an arrogant a\u2014hole. So Anna never talked to me, not once. When we finally talked, she realized I\u2019m so on the outs that [Joe and Aubry] were all I have. It was this crazy Stockholm Syndrome. I told her, \u201cIf you work with me, I\u2019ll get them out,\u201d but she had no interest in working with me. Julia came in and I sat in the ocean with her for hours, and she just nodded. I tried to lay out for her my position, where I saw the game, I don\u2019t like Joe for these reasons\u2026 and she was like, \u201cYeah, let\u2019s vote him out.\u201d I talk to Scot, and he\u2019s kind of just nodding. He never confirmed, and Tai never confirmed. I went to everyone, but no one gave me confirmation. No one ever said, \u201cYes, let\u2019s do that.\u201d\n\nWhen Joe was calling me out \u2014 and I think it was right after I was trying to get Aubry out \u2014 he asked, \u201cAre you trying to get me out?\u201d I was like, \u201cNo!\u201d But the truth was, I already tried the day prior. Today, I\u2019m trying to get Aubry out, and no one is working with me. So I wanted to say, \u201cJoe, no one is working with me.\u201d Afterwards, off-camera, I pulled Joe aside and I told him: \u201cI tried to get Aubry out, I tried to get you out\u2026 let\u2019s just work as Brains, and we\u2019ll get each other out later. Let\u2019s just stick with the numbers.\u201d And I honestly believed that.\n\nI was going to ask, if you wanted to take out Joe or Aubry, why not do it when Anna is still in the game? She strikes me as a self-interested person who would make that type of move to save her own hide \u2014 but you would answer that Anna wasn\u2019t entertaining conversations with you.\n\nNot once. Right when we got out there, Anna and Joe went to sit in a fishing hole and they talked about her Russian heritage and his Italian heritage, and they had this weird father-daughter thing. I went in there to try and break up that conversation, but it was just cold. I could not get Anna\u2026 every interaction with her did not feel genuine, unfortunately, because God, I wanted to work with her so bad. But she wouldn\u2019t \u2026 she understood where I was, that I was on the outs, but she never took the initiative to [work together].\n\nAnd Scot, Tai and Julia \u2014 they just weren\u2019t having it?\n\nWhen you go back to Joe challenging me, and they didn\u2019t show this, I went to Scot and Tai and we were going to get mangoes or something, and I laid out my plan again. \u201cGuys, we have to get together and get them out.\u201d I went to get water, and when I came back, Joe just nailed me. What happened was, Tai went straight to Joe and told him my plan. So once again, it was like every time I had a plan, they would go to Joe. I was like, \u201cWhat is going on?\u201d I\u2019m thinking, \u201cWe have an out. I\u2019m going to form a mutiny.\u201d And they would go and tell him immediately! So, like, what was I going to do? I was all over the place because I couldn\u2019t work with anyone, and my last resort was going with the Brains and doing the numbers thing, and by that time, I was septic. I had a fever. They didn\u2019t show the scene, but I was dying on the beach, and not once did anyone come up to me and say, \u201cHow are you doing?\u201d And I doctored those guys all day long every day, cutting off abscesses, and when I was on the beach, feeling sick, no one said, \u201cYou\u2019re sick, let\u2019s help you out.\u201d I\u2019m just like, \u201cYou suck! I\u2019m dying here!\u201d\n\nThere was a scene last night where you\u2019re talking to Julia in the water, and you\u2019re trembling. I was wondering, \u201cWhy is Pete crying right now?\u201d It turns out, you were pretty sick?\n\nI was sick as [expletive] out there. That was right after the reward challenge. We went in because we were hot. It was burning outside. I got in the ocean and I said, \u201cJulia, nice to meet you, my name\u2019s Peter, here\u2019s the plan.\u201d I felt we would lose every challenge with Joe. I wanted to plan ahead because Joe couldn\u2019t help in challenges. If he was 30 years old, he\u2019d be great. But he\u2019s a 72-year-old man. I treat 70-year-olds with hip fractures, and I was worried Joe would break a bone eventually. I could not rely on winning any challenges with Joe in the game.\n\nThe conditions this season were famously rough. As the resident doctor out there, what was the nastiest thing you observed?\n\nJust all the abscesses and all the infections. When you talked to Liz, did she tell you how she needed surgery?\n\nThat\u2019s public knowledge now, yeah.\n\nOkay, well, I had to get surgery too.\n\nWere you flown home for that?\n\nYeah, I went back to Minnesota to get surgery done.\n\nHow are you now?\n\nI\u2019m fine. I\u2019m back to being\u2026 arrogant. [Laughs] And that\u2019s another thing! You and I are talking and I can tell you, \u201cI\u2019m the strongest person, I can read that comic book in ten minutes,\u201d and you could say, \u201cPeter, what the [expletive] are you talking about?\u201d I\u2019m receptive to that. If I\u2019m challenged, I\u2019m good with saying, \u201cI don\u2019t know what I\u2019m talking about.\u201d That arrogance is so self-effacing and transparent that if you challenge me, I\u2019m fine with saying, \u201cYeah, I have no idea what I\u2019m talking about.\u201d No problem saying that.\n\nI want to know more about Joe\u2019s interrogation. What was it like to sit under Agent del Campo\u2019s heat lamp?\n\nMy first feeling was frustration. Joe was yelling at me and in my mind, I\u2019m thinking, \u201cWhy would Tai tell him?\u201d I couldn\u2019t fathom it. It happened within two minutes of coming back to camp, and it was like, \u201cTai couldn\u2019t not talk to Joe for two minutes?\u201d I was just pissed. I was flabbergasted.\n\nAt Tribal Council, you likened the people whispering at each other to piranhas. That\u2019s an evocative image. In that moment, did you know your goose was cooked?\n\nNo, they didn\u2019t show this at Tribal, but at Tribal, Scot looked at me and said: \u201cVote for Joe.\u201d I looked forward and acted like I couldn\u2019t hear him. There was a five second pause and Joe and Aubry were staring at me, because they couldn\u2019t hear what Scot said. Then all the sudden Scot says, \u201cPlan B,\u201d to Julia, which they did show. So I said piranhas, because I heard this chatter, and all the sudden Scot\u2019s saying, \u201cVote for Joe,\u201d but he didn\u2019t say anything for like three days prior! I was totally trying to be a politician in front of Joe. \u201cYou\u2019re going to tell me the plan five seconds before we vote?\u201d That\u2019s not going to work in my mind.\n\nBe careful with comparing yourself to a politician, Peter.\n\nOh, yeah. [Laughs] I forgot.\n\nHow annoying has that been?\n\nYou know, they keep wanting me to say, \u201cObama, Obama, Obama.\u201d But as it goes on, did you notice that the Obama references went away, because I started becoming more of an individual? Once they showed me being a jerk or whatever. But I wasn\u2019t that type of guy. I wasn\u2019t mobilizing people, with people coming up to me and telling me stuff because I\u2019m their leader. I\u2019m not a leader. I\u2019m a dude who punches in and punches out of work.\n\nI did find it funny when people pointed out that you were providing Obamacare to your tribe.\n\nYeah, that was a good one, when it hit Reddit. I think I one-upped that. That was good.\n\nIn your day after video, you said you wished you were more vindictive and left your soul at the door. What did you mean by that?\n\nI was referring to that Scot comment, \u201cVote Joe.\u201d This was after I gave my word to Joe. I told Joe right before Tribal, \u201cOkay, buddy. We\u2019ll go with the numbers. We\u2019ll get each other out later.\u201d I felt in that moment that I should go with Joe. We had our outs, but I believed that I had to go with him and Aubry. I couldn\u2019t just be flippant and switch again and be completely unpredictable. So I was mad at myself for not switching that up.\n\nRapid-fire, I want to get your quick takes on some of the other people out there, starting with Debbie.\n\nShe always had a target on her back. She, like Joe, was someone you wanted to keep around as long as you could, because she was going nowhere fast. They were the ones who stuck out, and the people who stick out have to get hammered down.\n\nHow about Neal?\n\nHe\u2019s a really smart guy. Smart people need to go fast. I tried to get him out because he\u2019s really good at Survivor.\n\nYou told Scot you wanted to vote for Julia instead of Tai, because you wanted to eat Tai\u2019s Vietnamese chicken. What does that mean?\n\nOh, Tai is a master at cooking. He could make anything taste good. It was crazy. He\u2019s a great cook.\n\nOn Twitter, you referred to Survivor as \u201cApology Wednesday.\u201d What does that entail?\n\nMy mom always gets on my back for the way I\u2019m portrayed out there. [Laughs] She gets upset. That\u2019s mom for you, though.\n\nWas it difficult to watch the show, since you were portrayed in a villainous light?\n\nIt was. It was, yeah. We\u2019re all conflict people. We all have different personalities, and different components to our personalities, and they took one part of my personality \u2014 the far edge of the histogram \u2014 and just exploded it. I was like, \u201cMan oh man.\u201d I\u2019m not saying I\u2019m mad, but that\u2019s what you think of me? I\u2019m not cooler than that? There\u2019s more to me.\n\nJosh Wigler is a writer, editor and podcaster who has been published by MTV News, New York Magazine, The Hollywood Reporter, Comic Book Resources and more.
