The figures are pretty staggering. Once fully in effect, Rubio\u2019s plan would increase the budget deficit by almost a trillion dollars a year. Rubio\u2019s tax cuts would overwhelmingly accrue to the rich. The highest-earning one percent would take home 40 percent of the benefit. The lowest-earning two-fifths of the country would see its income rise just over one percent from the Rubio tax cuts, while the richest one percent would see its income rise by almost 9 percent:\n\nDistribution of Federal Tax Change, Rubio Tax Plan By expanded cash income percentile, 2025\n\nExpanded cash income percentile Percent change in after-tax income (%) Share of total federal tax change (%) Average federal tax change ($) Change (% points) Under the proposal (%) Lowest quintile 1.3 1.9 -232 -1.2 3.3 Second quintile 1.1 3.4 -493 -1.0 7.7 Middle quintile 2.0 8.8 -1,430 -1.7 12.6 Fourth quintile 2.4 14.3 -2,807 -2.0 15.3 Top quintile 5.0 71.1 -16,946 -3.7 22.5 All 3.4 100.0 -3,275 -2.7 17.6 Addendum 80-90 3.2 12.5 -5,787 -2.6 17.5 90-95 3.2 8.1 -7,719 -2.5 19.2 95-99 3.2 10.1 -12,933 -2.4 22.7 Top 1 percent 8.9 40.3 -204,995 -5.9 27.6 Top 0.1 percent 11.5 22.8 -1,122,110 -7.6 26.8\n\nSource: Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center Microsimulation Model (version 05 15-3A)\n\nNaturally, Rubio\u2019s campaign is disputing the validity of these numbers. Lanhee Chen, a former Romney campaign adviser now working for Rubio, calls TPC biased for ignoring all of the bountiful economic growth Rubio\u2019s tax cuts will unleash, and also the spending cuts that will combine to offset their cost:\n\nA refresher for media who characterize the Tax Policy Center as unbiased: https://t.co/7QgEeO6PqA @OppLives \u2014 Lanhee J. Chen (@lanheechen) February 11, 2016\n\nAnd be wary of tax \"analyses\" that don't account for the impacts of growth, or include deficit estimates that ignore plans to cut spending \u2014 Lanhee J. Chen (@lanheechen) February 11, 2016\n\n\"Plans to cut spending,\" huh? I asked Chen where I could find a description of these spending cuts, and he pointed me to the issues page on Rubio\u2019s website. There you can find the following proposals to cut spending:\n\nSome of Marco\u2019s ideas to get spending under control: Fight for a Balanced Budget Amendment and force Washington to live within its means without raising taxes\n\nRepeal ObamaCare and cut trillions in spending on the job-destroying law\n\nPush for line-item veto authority to cut wasteful spending\n\nPermanently ban pork-barrel earmarks\n\nReduce the size of the federal workforce in Washington\n\nPrevent massive, irresponsible spending bills\n\nAllow states to use wasteful federal funds to pay down the national debt\n\nOppose corporate welfare like the New Deal-era Export-Import Bank\n\nReform budget rules to provide taxpayers with the true costs of government spending and the benefits of pro-growth policies\n\nReform and save Medicare and Social Security for future generations without impacting those in or near retirement\n\nSome of these proposals merely describe ambitions to cut spending (\u201cFight for a Balanced Budget Amendment and force Washington to live within its means without raising taxes \u2026 Push for line-item veto authority to cut wasteful spending \u2026 Prevent massive, irresponsible spending bills\u201d). Some of them are insignificant costs (\u201cOppose corporate welfare like the New Deal-era Export-Import Bank\u201d \u2014 which costs $2 billion over a decade, a trivial sum). The rest are undefined ambitions without concrete policies Rubio cares to defend, like reducing unspecified federal jobs or cutting future spending on Medicare and Social Security \u2014 but (Rubio\u2019s site assures us elsewhere) \u201cMaking no changes for those in or near retirement,\u201d which means no savings could be found in these programs in the near future.\n\nAnd there\u2019s repealing Obamacare. That would increase the deficit, too. Now, the cost of repealing the tax hikes that help pay for that law is already included in Rubio\u2019s budget, so we can give Rubio some credit here \u2014 there are savings to be found by yanking health insurance away from the 19 million people who have gained it through the Affordable Care Act. On the other hand, Rubio\u2019s list of budget promises does not mention his plans to jack up defense spending by about a trillion dollars over a decade.\n\nSo, in total, Rubio promises an enormous tax cut, higher defense spending, no changes to Medicare or Social Security over the next decade, and a balanced budget. All of those promises are necessary commitments one must make to be the candidate of the Republican Establishment, as Rubio hopes to be. But because these promises are so impossible, he can\u2019t accept the legitimacy of standard budget accounting and must rely on fantasy promises of massive economic growth, even though neither standard economics nor the history of the last 25 years provides much reason to believe debt-financed tax cuts do anything at all to increase economic growth. (Some studies suggest debt-financed tax cuts like those enacted under the Bush administration slightly reduced economic growth, if anything.) Rubio can either follow sane budget accounting principles, or he can make himself acceptable to Republican elites. He\u2019s chosen the latter.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#000", "description": "Let's dispel with the fiction that the Tax Policy Center knows what it's doing.", "generator": "the-factory", "og": {"site_name": "Daily Intelligencer", "description": "Let's dispel with the fiction that the Tax Policy Center knows what it's doing.", "title": "Marco Rubio\u2019s Campaign Declares War on Math", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2016/02/marco-rubios-campaign-declares-war-on-math.html", "image": "http://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2016/02/08/08-rubio.w1200.h630.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Let's dispel with the fiction that the Tax Policy Center knows what it's doing.", "title": "Marco Rubio\u2019s Campaign Declares War on Math", "image": "http://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2016/02/08/08-rubio.w750.h560.2x.jpg", "creator": "@jonathanchait", "site": "@intelligencer", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Daily Intelligencer", "fb": {"app_id": 120608177953522}, "msapplication-TileImage": "//cache.nymag.com/media/di/icon.144x144.png", "application-name": "Daily Intelligencer", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "keywords": "the national interest, politics, marco rubio, campaign 2016", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/NewYorkMag", "tag": "the national interest,politics,marco rubio,campaign 2016", "published_time": "2016-02-11T20:30:00.000Z", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/JonathanChaitPublic"}, "topics": "topics-test, the national interest, politics, marco rubio, campaign 2016", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,shrink-to-fit=no"}, "article_summary": "Rubio\u2019s tax cuts would overwhelmingly accrue to the rich.\n(Some studies suggest debt-financed tax cuts like those enacted under the Bush administration slightly reduced economic growth, if anything.)\nI asked Chen where I could find a description of these spending cuts, and he pointed me to the issues page on Rubio\u2019s website.\nOnce fully in effect, Rubio\u2019s plan would increase the budget deficit by almost a trillion dollars a year.\nThe Tax Policy Center released on Thursday its analysis of Marco Rubio's ginormous-tax-cut plan."}
