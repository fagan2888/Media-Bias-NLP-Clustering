Wednesday, February 19, 2014\n\nVice President Joe Biden told visitors to a Minneapolis coffee shop on Wednesday that the millions of people likely to sign up for health insurance before a March deadline is \u201ca hell of a start,\u201d despite the fact that the federal government probably will fall short of its goal.\n\nBiden, who was visiting Minneapolis for a private Democratic National Committee fundraiser, made an unannounced stop shortly after 4 p.m. at Moose & Sadie\u2019s coffee shop in Minneapolis\u2019 Warehouse District. He used the occasion to talk about the Affordable Care Act (ACA), which has been under heavy criticism since President Obama began pushing the reform and has drawn additional ire in recent months after a botched rollout.\n\nBiden said that, despite hiccups, the goal is to sign up 7 million people by the March 31 deadline.\n\n\u201cWe may not get to seven million, we may get to five or six, but that\u2019s a hell of a start,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m here to say thanks.\u201d\n\nThe vice president greeted cafe staff and customers, including Bessie Alyeshmerni, a 34-year-old U.S. Justice Department attorney who moved home to Minneapolis from Washington, D.C., after the breast cancer she was diagnosed with four years ago spread to her liver. Biden reached across the table and placed a hand on her cheek as she told her story.\n\nVice President Joe Biden greeted Bessie Alyeshmerni, who is battling cancer at Moose & Sadie's cafe in Minneapolis on Wednesday.\n\nAlyeshmerni, an ACA supporter, was initially told she had months to live but now has an estimated three to five years and is optimistic as medical advancements progress. She\u2019s insured through the federal government \u2014 a good thing, she added, because her chemotherapy drugs cost an estimated $200,000 every nine weeks.\n\n\u201cIt would have been a death sentence without my insurance,\u201d she said. \u201cOne of the most frustrating things is the socioeconomic groups that are told they\u2019re not going to make it and it\u2019s not because of our technology.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s access to relief and they just can\u2019t get it and it\u2019s heartbreaking. I want everybody to have the same care. The stress of fighting cancer is enough, let alone the stress of figuring out how you\u2019re going to pay for it.\u201d\n\nBiden then sat at a table with Rachel Lozano, Julie Peck, Karen Kepple and Anna Olson Racer, who had been invited to be there and who have either benefited from the Affordable Care Act or are helping others get signed up. \u201cDon\u2019t get up,\u201d he said when they stood to greet him.\n\nBiden leaned in, speaking quietly, his hoarse voice difficult to hear over the din of the cafe.\n\n\u201cLook, thank you for what you\u2019re doing,\u201d he told them, adding that between a serious car accident and brain aneurysm, \u201cI\u2019ve been a significant consumer of health care, and I\u2019m not bragging about it.\u201d\n\nDuring those hospital stays, \u201cAll I kept thinking about was \u2018Thank God I had all this insurance.\u2019 \u201d\n\nThe vice president\u2019s day in Minneapolis began when Air Force Two landed at 3:30 p.m. at Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport and Biden exited the jet, saluting a young airman standing at attention.\n\nHis motorcade headed toward Minneapolis in the deserted northbound lanes of Interstate 35W while southbound traffic slowed to gawk.\n\nOffice workers hung out of windows and snapped photos on an unseasonably warm day as the procession rolled through downtown.\n\nFrom the coffee shop, he was scheduled to head to the private fundraiser at the Bachelor Farmer, a restaurant owned by the sons of Gov. Mark Dayton.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Star Tribune", "description": "Vice President Joe Biden told visitors to a Minneapolis coffee shop that the millions of people likely to sign up for health insurance before a March deadline is \"a hell of a start,\" despite the fact that the federal government will likely fall short of its goal.", "title": "Biden in Minneapolis: Health insurance signup is 'hell of a start'", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/in-mpls-biden-praises-health-insurance-signup/246258551/", "image": {"url": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_139286316610757.jpg?h=630&w=1200&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=top", "width": 1200, "identifier": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_139286316610757.jpg?h=630&w=1200&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=top", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "google-site-verification": "bLXTXkzm4dJ8hcJy1LXawtxXxGP3JhInARj69uCiMiM", "twitter": {"description": "Vice President Joe Biden told visitors to a Minneapolis coffee shop that the millions of people likely to sign up for health insurance before a March deadline is \"a hell of a start,\" despite the fact that the federal government will likely fall short of its goal.", "title": "Biden in Minneapolis: Health insurance signup is 'hell of a start'", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/in-mpls-biden-praises-health-insurance-signup/246258551/", "image": {"src": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_139286316610757.jpg?h=560&w=750&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=top", "identifier": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_139286316610757.jpg?h=560&w=750&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=top"}, "site": "@StarTribune", "card": "summary"}, "description": "Vice President Joe Biden told visitors to a Minneapolis coffee shop that the millions of people likely to sign up for health insurance before a March deadline is \"a hell of a start,\" despite the fact that the federal government will likely fall short of its goal."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fced81\"", "article_summary": "Gallery: Vice President Joe Biden greeted Bessie Alyeshmerni who served as a civilian in Baghdad and is now in Minneapolis battling cancer.\nVice President Joe Biden greeted Bessie Alyeshmerni, who is battling cancer at Moose & Sadie's cafe in Minneapolis on Wednesday.\nGallery: Vice President Joe Biden arrived in Minneapolis.\nThe Vice President met with Rachel Lozano, Navigator at Portico Healthnet, Julie Peck, mother and small business owner, Karen Kepple, mother and attorney, Anna Olson Racer, mother and beginning farmer.\nGallery: People waved to the Vice President orom offices above Moose &Sadies."}
