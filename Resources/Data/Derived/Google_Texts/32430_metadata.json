Bernie Sanders (I-VT), the ranking member on the Senate Budget Committee.\n\nRelated: Cornyn Says Budget Deal Inevitable to Avert a Government Shutdown\n\nRaising the spending limits set by the 2011 Budget Control Act, which are set to return in October, would lead to economic growth, at least in the short-term.\n\n\u201cFully eliminating the reductions would allow for an increase in appropriations of $90 billion in 2016 and $91 billion in 2017,\u201d CBO Director Keith Hall wrote in a letter to Sanders.\n\nCBO estimates that lifting the budget caps for 2016 could result in the full-time employment of anywhere between 200,000 and 800,000 more people. Meanwhile, reversing them in 2017 could add between 100,000 and 600,000 jobs.\n\nThe agency\u2019s assessment isn\u2019t entirely optimistic, though, as Hall warns that lifting the ceilings could lead to increased federal deficits in the future.\n\nRelated: What Balanced Budget?

Bush\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers, to lead the agency earlier this year.\n\nRelated: Out of the Ashes of Budget Politics \u2013 A Compromise?\n\nFor his part, Sanders welcomed the report\u2019s findings.\n\n\u201cThese arbitrary sequestration caps have never made any sense, and now we see even more clearly the implications for our workers,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cIf Congress does not act to end sequestration, we\u2019re looking at the loss of as many as 1.4 million jobs over the next two years.\u201d\n\nSanders said lawmakers \u201cmust end sequestration now ahead of the end of the fiscal year and prevent a budget showdown that will help nobody.\u201d\n\n\"It makes no sense to head towards a crisis when we have a clear path towards a better solution,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "In what is sure to become a Democratic talking point when Congress reconvenes in September, the Congressional Budget Office on Tuesday said the U.S. economy could add as many as 1.4 million jobs if lawmakers lift federal spending caps for fiscal 2016 and 2017.", "title": "U.S. Could Lose Out on 1.4 Million Jobs if Congress Refuses to Make a Budget Deal", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/08/12/US-Could-Lose-14-Million-Jobs-if-Congress-Refuses-Make-Budget-Deal", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/01042013_budget_cut_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/08/12/US-Could-Lose-14-Million-Jobs-if-Congress-Refuses-Make-Budget-Deal", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/01042013_budget_cut_article.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "In what is sure to become a Democratic talking point when Congress reconvenes in September, the Congressional Budget Office on Tuesday said the U.S. economy could add as many as 1.4 million jobs if lawmakers lift federal spending caps for fiscal 2016 and 2017.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbb83\"", "article_summary": "CBO estimates that lifting the budget caps for 2016 could result in the full-time employment of anywhere between 200,000 and 800,000 more people.\n\u201cThese arbitrary sequestration caps have never made any sense, and now we see even more clearly the implications for our workers,\u201d he said in a statement.\nThe new report by the nonpartisan agency was requested by 2016 Democratic presidential hopeful Sen.
