Dems may face long coal country exile\n\nThe Republicans\u2019 romp this week may have permanently turned coal country from blue to red.\n\nCoal-heavy districts in West Virginia, Kentucky and Illinois that had been steadily moving away from Democrats in recent elections appear to have completed that shift Tuesday, when they overwhelmingly backed Republicans who vowed to oppose what they call President Barack Obama\u2019s \u201cwar on coal.\u201d\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nDemocrats\u2019 support in coal areas may never come back, said Andrew Wheeler of the law firm Faegre Baker Daniels, a former GOP staff director for Oklahoma Sen. Jim Inhofe on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: GOP, Obama clash on immigration)\n\n\u201cThis has been a growing trend in coal politics and will outlast President Obama\u2019s tenure,\u201d Wheeler said.\n\nIn West Virginia, once a long-time Democratic stronghold, Republicans will take control of both houses of the state legislature for the first time since 1931. Republicans picked up seven seats in the state Senate to bring the balance to 17-17, and then Democrat Daniel Hall switched parties Wednesday to give the majority to the GOP.\n\nVoters there also elected Rep. Shelley Moore Capito as their first GOP senator in 56 years, and Republicans won three congressional contests, even kicking out 38-year incumbent Rep. Nick Rahall.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: Landrieu faces runoff alone)\n\nCoal was only one issue for voters, who also cited the economy and Obamacare as reasons for ditching the Democrats in the midterms. But with EPA moving ahead on rules to limit greenhouse gases from power plants, and its past pollution regulations helping push dozens of old coal-fired power plants into retirement, candidates who line up with the president became a tough sell in areas that have few other industries outside the shrinking coal-mining sector.\n\nThe \u201cpolicies and priorities espoused by the national Democratic Party, as reflected in their platform, don\u2019t resonate with the priorities, beliefs and feelings of the people\u201d of West Virginia, said Evan Jenkins, the Republican who will take Rahall\u2019s place in Congress.\n\n\u201cSouthern West Virginia in particular has been devastated economically over this last six years in the war on coal,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult for West Virginia Democrats to explain to the voters why their party maintains such an anti-coal agenda.\u201d\n\n( Also on POLITICO: Boehner: Obama will 'burn himself')\n\nBut one West Virginia Democrat said the party may have a good chance of shedding that anti-coal image once Obama leaves office.\n\n\u201cObviously the war on coal has been a powerful narrative for the Republicans,\u201d said Dave Eplin, executive director of the West Virginia Young Democrats. \u201cI think at this point they may have tied it so tightly to Obama that it may be difficult to continue it when he\u2019s out of office.\u201d\n\nEplin said Rahall\u2019s loss surprised him, as did the defeat of Nick Casey, who lost to Republican Alex Money in the contest to replace Capito in the House.\n\nAcross coal states, the United Mine Workers of America union ferociously backed Democratic candidates, including Rahall, Senate candidate Alison Lundergan Grimes in Kentucky and Capito\u2019s opponent, Natalie Tennant. But its endorsements didn\u2019t appear to sway many voters.\n\nCORRECTION: Corrected by: Daniella Diaz @ 11/08/2014 10:28 AM Correction: This story has been updated to correct a misspelling in Capito\u2019s name.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "United Mine Workers of America backed Democratic candidates, but that didn\u2019t appear to sway voters.", "title": "Dems may face long coal country exile", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2014/11/dems-may-face-long-exile-from-coal-country-112700.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2014/11/07/141107_mcconnell_coal_ap_605.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "West Virginia,Energy,Illinois,Kentucky,Coal,Environment,Politics", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "United Mine Workers of America backed Democratic candidates, but that didn\u2019t appear to sway voters.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcfdae\"", "article_summary": "Dems may face long coal country exileThe Republicans\u2019 romp this week may have permanently turned coal country from blue to red.\n\u201cSouthern West Virginia in particular has been devastated economically over this last six years in the war on coal,\u201d he said.\n\u201cObviously the war on coal has been a powerful narrative for the Republicans,\u201d said Dave Eplin, executive director of the West Virginia Young Democrats.\nIn West Virginia, once a long-time Democratic stronghold, Republicans will take control of both houses of the state legislature for the first time since 1931.\n( Also on POLITICO: GOP, Obama clash on immigration)\u201cThis has been a growing trend in coal politics and will outlast President Obama\u2019s tenure,\u201d Wheeler said."}
