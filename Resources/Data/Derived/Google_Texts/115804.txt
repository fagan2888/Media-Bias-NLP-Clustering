PHILADELPHIA —The Philadelphia Eagles have traded quarterback Matt Barkley to the Arizona Cardinals, clearing a roster spot for Tim Tebow.

Arizona sent a conditional seventh-round draft pick to Philadelphia for Barkley. He’ll provide depth behind Carson Palmer and Drew Stanton. Logan Thomas and rookie Phillip Sims were competing for the No. 3 job.

Tebow outplayed Barkley in the preseason and appears to have locked up the No. 3 job behind Sam Bradford and Mark Sanchez.

Tebow signed with the Eagles in March. He last played in the regular season in 2012 with the New York Jets.
