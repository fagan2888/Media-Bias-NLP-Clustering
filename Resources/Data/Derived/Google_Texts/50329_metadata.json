Today I\u2019ll highlight some of the qualitative responses received from more than 450 participants, who offered their opinions on the biggest gaps and opportunities they perceived in managing services procurement today.\n\nYou can find other posts in this series below, including response data suggesting best-of-breed vendor management system (VMS) and managed services provider (MSP) penetration is not as robust as many believe it is.\n\nBut back to the subject at hand. When asked the question, \u201cWhat are the biggest gaps/opportunities that you see in managing services spending and the extended workforce?\u201d participants offered some of the following qualitative responses:\n\nUncertainty regarding regulatory compliance and such as the Affordable Care Act, co-employment and misclassification\n\nBiggest gap: the organization\u2019s unwillingness to take control of this huge expense and better manage it from all perspectives \u2013 cost, risk, worker classification, on/off boarding\n\n\u201cWe have a robust application tracking and managing all supply-side spend. We are focused on line-of-business needs and compliance to program as a means to optimize demand side cost.\u201d\n\nSpend analysis, forecasting and demand planning is poor in case of services.\n\nObtaining alignment with internal customers and buy-in from stakeholders\n\n\u201cThe biggest opportunity for us lies in using an MSP-VMS solution.\u201d\n\nReporting and tracking contingent workforce and benchmarking of rates for labor\n\nOne of the central themes on both sides of the improvement and opportunities coin appears to be the effective use of quantitative information, including spend and supplier data. Of course the irony of this is all the top VMS providers \u2013 Fieldglass, IQNavigator, Beeline \u2013 offer analytics and integrated rate and related guidance as part of their solutions.\n\nBut are companies using it effectively, let alone adopting these capabilities at the level they should? (The study found that only 22% of respondents uses a best of breed VMS solution.)\n\nWhat do you think?
