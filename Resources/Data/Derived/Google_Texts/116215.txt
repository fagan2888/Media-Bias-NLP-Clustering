Baton Rouge's Cassie Felder became the first woman to officially join the race for Louisiana's 6th Congressional District race on Thursday (Jan. 9).

Felder, 39, is independent attorney and part-owner of the real estate firm Regal Title, and is running as a Republican focused on repealing the Affordable Care Act and reducing the size of government. She filed candidacy papers with the Federal Elections Commission in November.

"I am new to politics, and I know it's not a game of winners and losers," Felder said in an email announcing her candidacy. "It's about protecting our families, our freedoms and our future...We can repeal the Obama agenda before it destroys our health care system, economy, and standing in the world."

Felder, raised in Hammond, moved back to Baton Rouge in 2010. Her mother, Pat, was named chair of the Baton Rouge Area Chamber board of directors for 2013 and co-owns Felder's Collision Parts with her father.

Several other candidates have also officially jumped into the race, including small businessman Paul Dietzel II, state Sen. Dan Claitor, R-Baton Rouge and Democrat Richard Dean Lieberman, a real estate broker living in LaPlace.

Baton Rouge Metro Councilman Ryan Heck and Norman "Norm" Clark, a disabled veteran and Ph.D. candidate in LSU's political science program, have also signaled their intent to run but have not formally announced.

The 6th District seat will be vacated when U.S. Rep. Bill Cassidy, R-Baton Rouge, steps down to challenge Democrat Mary Landrieu in November for the Senate seat she's held for three terms.

The seat represents a wide swath of the southeastern quadrant of the state, including parts of Baton Rouge and the river parishes.
