The law\u2019s Medicaid expansion was starting to roll out across the country.\n\nAnd in California, state Sen. Richard Lara (D-Bell Gardens) brought advocates together to take a new approach on an old issue.\n\nTheir decision: It was time to fight for health coverage for undocumented workers, too.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve made enormous strides to reduce California\u2019s uninsured population with the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, but we won\u2019t have a truly healthy state until everyone has access to quality, affordable coverage,\u201d Lara announced in January 2014.\n\n\u201cImmigration status shouldn\u2019t bar individuals from health coverage, especially since their taxes contribute to the growth of our economy.\u201d\n\nLara\u2019s plan involved expanding Medi-Cal and creating a new health insurance exchange for undocumented immigrants to purchase coverage. His bill \u2014 SB 1005 \u2014 ultimately stalled in the senate. But he\u2019s back with a new bill (SB 4), more co-sponsors and more momentum.\n\nSupporters acknowledge: Expanding health coverage to undocumented immigrants is politically difficult. It\u2019s unprecedented.\n\nIt\u2019s perfect for California.\n\nWhy Now\n\nWhile there are still debates over the ACA\u2019s cost, even critics concede that the law\u2019s coverage expansion has worked.\n\nThe nation\u2019s uninsured rate has now fallen to less than 12%, according to Gallup, and continues to plummet.\n\nBut unless there\u2019s major reform, the nation\u2019s uninsured rate will eventually hit a floor before it hits 0%.\n\nWhile the ACA expanded coverage, it didn\u2019t make it universal. And in California, as many as 4 million people are expected to remain uninsured.\n\nAbout 1 million of them are undocumented immigrants.\n\nNot everyone wants to expand coverage to this group. Some critics are worried that Medi-Cal is already facing too many new enrollees, and that another coverage expansion would only exacerbate access issues. While supporters of SB 4 say it would cost just $350 million to expand Medi-Cal under the bill, citing a UCLA and UC-Berkeley report, others are pointing to a new Senate estimate that fully covering undocumented immigrants through the program could cost as much as $740 million per year.\n\nSome state Republicans are balking at the added spending. \u201cWe understand the burdens facing immigrants,\u201d wrote Senate Republican leader Bob Huff, addressing a slew of recent bills.\n\n\u201cBut without money from Congress and President Obama it will be very difficult and costly for California taxpayers to fund all of these bill proposals.\u201d\n\nBut advocates believe they have public support on their side. According to a statewide poll released in October 2014, 54% percent of survey respondents said they support covering undocumented immigrants.\n\nSupporters of SB 4 also believe that the timing is right. The new plan is one-sixth less expensive than last year\u2019s proposal, given President Obama\u2019s executive order to offer deportation relief to certain undocumented immigrants.\n\nAnd given the cost of administering health care to undocumented immigrants in California \u2014 more than $1 billion in uncompensated care per year \u2014 they think the numbers add up.\n\n\u201cThe \u2018best\u2019 argument for expanding health care coverage is that almost all undocumented immigrants are in families with working adults,\u201d says UCLA health policy professor Steven Wallace. \u201cThey contribute to the economy we all benefit from, pay taxes \u2026 and are members of the community.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is in everyone\u2019s interest to help these workers and their families stay healthy and productive,\u201d he adds. \u201cAnd minimize the burden of the diseases they may end up with, which is one role of health insurance.\u201d\n\nCalifornia\u2019s move is unusual because many other states, especially in the South, are still grappling with expanding coverage to populations that were intended to be covered by the ACA.\n\n\u201cWe are having a very different conversation,\u201d Cindy Zeldin, executive director of Georgians for a Healthy Future, told Anna Gorman of Kaiser Health News. \u201cI think we are really far away as a state from where California is.\u201d\n\nBut the push to expand coverage in California tracks with national movement on immigrants\u2019 rights, says Kinsey Hasstedt, a policy analyst with the Guttmacher Institute.\n\nFor example, there are efforts at the federal level \u2014 the House is considering the Health Equity and Access Under the Law (HEAL) for Immigrant Women and Families Act \u2014 to expand coverage to immigrant populations.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s different than California\u2019s Health Care for All movement,\u201d Hasstedt points out. \u201cThe HEAL Act extends to lawfully present immigrants.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut streamlining all of this, and making it such that regardless of your status, you\u2019d get health care, would benefit everyone,\u201d she says.\n\nWhat Comes Next\n\n\u201cThe prospects for SB 4 are better this year than last because the economy is better,\u201d says Wallace. He notes that the state can likely afford the expansion \u2014 which some advocates peg as a 2% increase in annual Medi-Cal spending \u2014 and that health care providers are likely to offer \u201csolid\u201d support, given that the plan would reduce their uncompensated care costs.\n\nBut the road for SB 4 is long.\n\nThe bill needs to pass out of the Senate Appropriations Committee.\n\nThen it goes to the Senate floor.\n\nThen it needs to go through the same process in the Assembly.\n\nThen it needs to get revised again.\n\n\u201cIf it stalls at any point in the process, it becomes a two-year bill,\u201d concedes Anthony Wright, director of Health Access California.\n\n\u201cBut we have greater momentum \u2014 we are at a better place this year than last year,\u201d he adds, pointing to the bill\u2019s lower cost and increased number of co-sponsors.\n\nAnd just getting out of the appropriations committee would be a small victory.\n\n\u201cIf we pass this hurdle, then we advance further than last year\u2019s proposal,\u201d Wright says.\n\nThe plan also appeals to what some California leaders say is in the state\u2019s DNA: Being the nation\u2019s pace car on an important health care issue.\n\n\u201cOnce again, California has the opportunity to demonstrate visionary leadership,\u201d Lara said on a conference call with reporters on Monday.\n\n\u201cAnd realize the dream of a truly healthy California.\u201d\n\nAround the nation\n\nHere\u2019s a look at other stories making news on the road to reform.\n\nDo the ACA\u2019s patient satisfaction measures improve care? Writing at the Association for Health Journalists\u2019 blog, Joanne Kenen examines how the health law\u2019s intended measures are playing out.\n\nThe Pioneer ACO program, examined. New research suggests that participants in the much-watched pilot program saved 1.2% on health care spending.
