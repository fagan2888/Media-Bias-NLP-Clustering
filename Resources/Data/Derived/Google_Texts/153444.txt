Miss Turtle Creek Jordin Johnson

The 2014 Miss Mississippi Pageant is just around the corner and a local contestant is working to get the word out about her platform, Rethink America, Buy American.

Meridian resident, Jordin Johnson, was named Miss Turtle Creek last August. Since then, she has been spending time speaking around the United States about the importance of keeping manufacturing in this country.

Johnson recently spent time in Washington, D.C., promoting that message..

"Rethink America, Buy American", and it promotes the importance of keeping manufacturing jobs in America rather than outsourcing those jobs," said Johnson. "This has been a huge issue we've seen with our economy, over 4 million jobs have disappeared, and my job is to educate the public about this issue."

Johnson will compete in the Miss Mississippi Pageant July 12-15 in Vicksburg. She will be competing against 40 other women from across the state.
