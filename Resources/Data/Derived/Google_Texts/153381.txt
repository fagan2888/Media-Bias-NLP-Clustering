One person has died and another was taken to the hospital following a crash Friday evening on the Kansas Turnpike in Sumner County.

The crash happened around 8:30 p.m. in the northbound lanes of the Turnpike near the Belle Plaine service area.

Rachel Bell with the Kansas Turnpike Authority says a car was heading northbound and lost control. It struck the cement divider and came to rest facing the wrong direction with no headlight's on.

A second vehicle then stuck the one that crashed. Bell says either someone in the first vehicle was ejected during the crash or got out afterward. That person was then hit by a third vehicle and died at the scene. One other person was taken to a hospital with unknown injuries.

Bell says one of the vehicles involved is a commercial motor vehicle.

Northbound lanes of the Turnpike have reopened, but the Kansas Highway Patrol's CHART had a team en route to investigate. That is standard procedure when a commercial vehicle is involved in a crash, Bell says.

The driver of the first vehicle has been identified as 58-year-old Douglas Rogers.
