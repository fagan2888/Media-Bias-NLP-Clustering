New portions of the Affordable Care Act are slated to take effect in October and January and aim to insure people who are unemployed and underemployed.

The News-Herald is gathering stories from people in Lake, Geauga and eastern Cuyahoga counties who are either unemployed or employed part-time, and are considering health coverage from the marketplace that opens in October or Medicaid expansion expected in January.
