We all know that pollution is bad for our health.

Just how bad was laid out by the World Health Organization this week in a bleak new report on environmentally related deaths.

New analysis of data from 2012 found that a staggering 12.6 million people died that year from living and working in toxic environments.

That’s almost equivalent to the combined populations of New York City and Los Angeles, and represents nearly a quarter of the 55.6 million deaths recorded that year.

That’s scary, but it gets worse.

The number of deaths due to noncommunicable diseases, such as stroke, heart disease, cancer and respiratory illness, made up 8.2 million or nearly two-thirds of the deaths resulting from unhealthy environments. The WHO says these deaths were mostly caused by air pollution.

These are preventable deaths, the WHO reminds us.

“A healthy environment underpins a healthy population,” WHO Director General Margaret Chan said in a statement. “If countries do not take actions to make environments where people live and work healthy, millions will continue to become ill and die too young.”

Low- and middle-income countries in Southeast Asia and the Western Pacific Region, where rapid economic growth has been blamed for soaring levels of air, water and soil contamination, were the worst affected by environmental-related deaths. Those regions had an estimated death toll of 7.3 million, mostly as a result of indoor and outdoor air pollution.

The very young and the very old were the most vulnerable members of the global population: 1.7 million children under the age of 5 and 4.9 million adults aged between 50 and 75 years old lost their lives because of environmental factors.
