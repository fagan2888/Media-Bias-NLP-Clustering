Standing on the steps of a large, blue recreational vehicle, nurse practitioner Summer Tekippe welcomed visitors.\n\n\u201cSo, this is Family Health Center\u2019s medical mobile unit. C\u2019mon in, and I\u2019ll show you around,\" Tekippe said.\n\nInside, Tekippe pointed to a desk.\n\n\u201cOver here, we have where the providers sit,\" she said. \"We can do charting and we do all of the ordering here on the electronic health record. And then our patients come over here, and they\u2019re seen in this clinic.\u201d\n\nInside the exam room are all the tools of the trade, including a blood pressure cuff, stethoscope and various other medical equipment. Tekippe said they offer a wide range of medical services in the mobile health unit.\n\n\u201cSo we do pediatric physicals, we do adult physicals. We treat chronic illnesses like diabetes, blood pressure control, hyperlipidemia, minor illnesses, asthma, exacerbations, cuts, scrapes, things like that,\" she explained.\n\nFamily Health Centers has three mobile health units that deliver care to people\u2019s doorsteps. Tekippe said the units fit right in with the goal of the Affordable Care Act: making care more accessible.\n\n\u201cSo it really takes away some of the barriers about being able to come out your door, see someone on the street that\u2019s a healthcare provider, and being able to walk into a clinic, and get the health care that you need,\u201d she said.\n\nThe location for the mobile unit on this Monday is the KIVA program, operated by the McAlister Institute. It\u2019s home to some 80 women who are trying to kick their addiction to alcohol and other drugs.\n\nIt's common for people in recovery to start taking care of health problems they\u2019ve been neglecting for some time. That\u2019s where this mobile medical clinic comes in handy.\n\nDeborah, who doesn\u2019t want to use her last name, has been a heroin addict for eight years. She\u2019s been homeless for some of that time. This is her fourth attempt at recovery in the KIVA program.\n\nWhen Deborah was here in January, she had a bad cough. So she visited the mobile unit.\n\n\u201cAnd I went in there, and I had pneumonia,\" she recalled. \"And I wouldn\u2019t have gone to the doctor if that wasn\u2019t available to me. So I went in, and they diagnosed me with antibiotics, and I started to feel a lot better. But I just wouldn\u2019t have taken care of myself by going actually to a doctor. So it\u2019s really just amazingly convenient and provident.\u201d\n\nAt this visit, Deborah is getting a tuberculosis test. It\u2019s one the requirements to get into a vocational program at KIVA. The Affordable Care Act has extended health insurance to many previously uninsured Californians. But Family Health Centers government relations manager Ben Avey explained some of them don\u2019t know how to access care outside of a hospital emergency department.\n\n\u201cBy having the mobile medical unit, you\u2019re able to introduce them to a healthcare system. You bring them in, you introduce them to the doctor, and they build that relationship, so that they can continue their care long term,\u201d Avey said.\n\nFamily health centers and other community clinics do more than just provide care. Avey said they\u2019re also helping to spread the word about what\u2019s available under the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cOur community outreach teams do a lot of education,\" he added. \"They come here to McAlister and other sites, educate people about what the Affordable Care Act is, you know, what is Obamacare. And based on that, they\u2019re able to set them up with appointments to actually enroll in insurance, if they\u2019re eligible.\u201d\n\nFamily Health Centers has enrolled 5,000 San Diegans in the Medi-Cal program since last October.\n\nCountywide, a total of 107,000 people have newly enrolled in the program. The ultimate goal is to connect these newly insured with a primary care doctor at a brick and mortar clinic. But for now, women in the KIVA program, like Sherry Manning, are happy to have the care come to them.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have to go anywhere and wait on a bus or trolley, and wait in a lobby,\" she said. \"It\u2019s right here at my doorstep. So, I am blessed.\"", "article_metadata": {"description": "When it comes to expanding access to care, especially under the Affordable Care Act, mobile medical units are working to fill the gap.", "author": "Kenny Goldberg", "og": {"site_name": "KPBS Public Media", "description": "When it comes to expanding access to care, especially under the Affordable Care Act, mobile medical units are working to fill the gap.", "title": "Mobile Medical Units Deliver To San Diego's Underserved", "url": "http://www.kpbs.org/news/2014/jun/17/mobile-medical-units-deliver-underserved/", "image": "https://kpbs.media.clients.ellingtoncms.com/img/news/tease/2014/06/12/Screen_Shot_2014-06-12_at_11.34.58_AM.png", "type": "article"}, "has_audio": 1, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "KPBS", "fb": {"app_id": 131056773055}, "apiKpbs": "139529 %##% Mobile Medical Units Deliver To San Diego's Underserved", "keywords": "News, Health, Programs, Evening Edition", "verify-v1": "zHHWZpwcl/kpXf/ZbbmtRN41TWDeCfjQil8LGROx/LA=", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no,shrink-to-fit=no"}, "article_summary": "\u201cSo, this is Family Health Center\u2019s medical mobile unit.\nFamily Health Centers has three mobile health units that deliver care to people\u2019s doorsteps.\n\u201cBy having the mobile medical unit, you\u2019re able to introduce them to a healthcare system.\nOn a Monday afternoon in east San Diego County, health care is available in a parking lot.\nThat\u2019s where this mobile medical clinic comes in handy."}
