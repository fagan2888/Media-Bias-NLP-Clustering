A couple put a clever spin on the classic new baby photo shoot and posed for pictures with their puppy, Humphry.

According to a report by Buzzfeed, the photographer, Elisha Minnette came up with the idea for the alternative “newborn photo shoot” with the couple, Matt and Abby, after they picked up the pup from a breeder.

“Abby and I have the craziest sense of humor and we feed off each other with ideas,” Minnette said, according to Buzzfeed.

Minnette posted the photos to her Facebook page in mid-August 2015 and they were shared more than 23,000 times in a matter of days.

“Making people smile & have a laugh was our intention for these images… of the ‘fake newborn shoot with a puppy’ and… I feel we achieved that,” Minnette wrote on her Facebook page. “So thank you!!”
