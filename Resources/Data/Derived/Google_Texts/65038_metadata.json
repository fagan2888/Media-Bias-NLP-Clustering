As he was putting together a Hall of Fame career as the Broncos\u2019 quarterback, Elway enjoyed the playoffs.\n\nHis job now is putting together the Broncos\u2019 roster that defeated the San Diego Chargers in the second-round of the playoffs last week, a victory that put his team in the AFC championship game Sunday against the New England Patriots.\n\nHis current position is less enjoyable come playoff time.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very different,\u201d Elway said Thursday during a roundtable discussion with several local and national writers in the Broncos\u2019 upstairs conference room. \u201cIt takes some getting used to. I enjoy watching the regular-season games, but I was absolutely miserable last week watching this game. It took me four hours to get the pit out of my stomach when it was over. It\u2019s not nearly as much fun upstairs as it is down on the field, especially these championship games and the playoffs.\n\n\u201cBut I\u2019m also proud of being a part of it. Being able to help put the team together, put the coaches together and the personnel side, for everything to come together. There is more of a quiet pride than it is being a quarterback when everybody is patting you on the back.\u201d\n\nWas that pit especially large on third-and-17?\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d he said. \u201cIt started growing about the middle of the third quarter. It felt pretty good at halftime.\u201d\n\nIn the middle of the third quarter, Broncos cornerback Chris Harris suffered a torn anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee. This past week, Elway signed cornerback Marquice Cole.\n\nIt\u2019s been three years almost to the day since Elway was hired by owner Pat Bowlen to take control of the Broncos\u2019 football department. The team he inherited was coming off a 4-12 season that led to the dismissal of coach and football operations boss Josh McDaniels.\n\nIn the three years since, the Broncos have won three AFC West titles and advanced to the playoffs\u2019 second round \u2014 the NFL\u2019s Elite Eight \u2014 all three years. This is the first time that Elway the executive has reached the Final Four. In the AFC championship, Elway\u2019s Broncos will play a Pats team that has McDaniels as offensive coordinator.\n\nWhen Elway took over the front office, he anticipated the challenges of rebuilding a roster. He did not anticipate so many crisis coming across his large desk.\n\n\u201cUh, no,\u201d Elway said. \u201cNo. But when you have problems,being a good leader is taking care of those and making sure everyone feels comfortable that when the house is on fire that we go ahead and take care of our business and realize there\u2019s a solution to this and we\u2019ll get through this. I\u2019ve tried to be that rock on the front side, saying we\u2019ll get it covered, we\u2019ll get it handled.\u201d\n\nHis problems started early in the offseason when his top two assistants, Matt Russell and Tom Heckert, were arrested on drunk driving charges, then his star defensive player, Von Miller, was suspended for violating the league\u2019s drug policy.\n\n\u201cBoth those ruined my summer,\u201d Elway said. \u201cI remember where I was sitting when I got both those phone calls.\n\n\u201cBut I\u2019m proud of the outcome. I\u2019m proud of the way the team has played and kept the focus. The leadership on the football team as well the coaching staff has been tremendous and keeping mentally tough and dealing with different situations we\u2019ve had this year.\u201d\n\nAlthough the Broncos were 13-3 and the No. 1 seed each of the past two years, Elway said even before beating San Diego last week his team was better equipped for a successful playoff run this year.\n\n\u201cLast year everybody was building us up,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd sometimes that hurts you. This year I think there\u2019s more of an underdog mentality for us in the fact that no one thought we were going to get by San Diego.\u201d\n\nMike Klis: mklis@denverpost.com or twitter.com/mikeklis", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "John Elway says move from player to executive takes adjustment come playoff time", "title": "John Elway says move from player to executive takes adjustment come playoff time", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/01/16/john-elway-says-move-from-player-to-executive-takes-adjustment-come-playoff-time/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140116__john-elway-san-diego-chargersp1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140116__john-elway-san-diego-chargersp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-01-16T11:46:58+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-28T00:07:00+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fceb93\"", "article_summary": "As he was putting together a Hall of Fame career as the Broncos\u2019 quarterback, Elway enjoyed the playoffs.\nThis past week, Elway signed cornerback Marquice Cole.\nIt\u2019s been three years almost to the day since Elway was hired by owner Pat Bowlen to take control of the Broncos\u2019 football department.\n\u201cBut I\u2019m proud of the outcome.\nI\u2019m proud of the way the team has played and kept the focus."}
