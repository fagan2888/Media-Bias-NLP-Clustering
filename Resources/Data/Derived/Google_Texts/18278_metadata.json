Joseph Tony had heard VCS Mining Inc. was bringing jobs, along with paved roads and electricity, to this corner of rural northern Haiti. \u201cEverybody is waiting,\u201d he said.\n\nBut Williamcite Noel, the only VCS employee in Haiti, had nothing to offer. Although the company received one of two gold mining permits in December 2012, the project known by the hill on which is located, Morne Bossa, was frozen two months later when Parliament imposed a moratorium on mining activity amid deep concerns about whether the country has the capacity to adequately regulate such a complex industry.\n\nMining had been seen as a potential new source of revenue and jobs for impoverished Haiti after the January 2010 earthquake devastated the capital in the south. Companies spent $30 million prospecting, with the encouragement of a government eager to bring development to the countryside, where most people get by on subsistence farming and lack even basic services.\n\nBut the new era in mining that some had predicted remains out of reach because the Haiti has been unable to enact a revised mining law establishing such fundamental issues as the environmental regulations and royalty revenues.\n\nNow it\u2019s too late for this government. The administration of President Michel Martelly, a musician who had little support in the Senate and Chamber of Deputies when he took office in May 2011, was unable to get the law completed and passed before Parliament was dissolved in January. The prospects when a new government takes over next year are uncertain.\n\n\u201cEverything is being put on hold,\u201d said Tucker Barrie, vice president of exploration for Majescor Resources Inc., a Canadian company that received the other production permit, for two concessions north of Morne Bossa.\n\nMajescor once had up to 100 workers in Haiti assisting with its exploration, but went down to a single caretaker. After spending $5 million, the company last month turned over its stake to its Haitian subsidiary in exchange for a share of any future royalties. Barrie said that will require the local firm to find a new partner or outside capital.\n\n\u201cThere will be little interest until the mining law issues are resolved,\u201d he said.\n\nMining giant Newmont Mining Corp., which was studying Haiti for potential sites in partnership with Eurasian Minerals Inc., suspended active exploration in the country in 2012, according to spokesman Omar Jabara.\n\nBefore the post-quake mining push, the mineral extraction industry had been dormant in Haiti since a copper mine near Gonaives closed in the 1970s. The country is believed to have the same veins of copper and gold found across the border in the Dominican Republic and could yield an estimated $20 billion in gold and other metals.\n\nAngelo Viard, the Haitian-American president of VCS, pledged to hire locals, pave roads and bring electricity to the village near his 31-acre claim on Morne Bossa. The company built a basketball court and sponsored a soccer tournament, and Tony said that generated goodwill. \u201cPeople have a lot of hope in the company,\u201d he said.\n\nMany Haitians are not eager to see the development of mining, skeptical of an industry that could pollute a country with a history of weak regulation and environmental problems. Camille Chalmers, an economics professor and member of an advocacy group called the Mining Justice Collective, said any potential benefits for Haitian workers are vastly overstated.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Mining in Haiti on hold amid uncertainty and opposition", "title": "Mining in Haiti on hold amid uncertainty and opposition", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Mining in Haiti on hold amid uncertainty and opposition", "title": "Mining in Haiti on hold amid uncertainty and opposition", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/04/13/mining_in_haiti_on_hold_amid_uncertainty_and_opposition/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/04/haiti-mining-bust.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Mining in Haiti on hold amid uncertainty and opposition", "title": "Mining in Haiti on hold amid uncertainty and opposition", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/04/haiti-mining-bust.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Ben Fox", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1512\"", "article_summary": "Joseph Tony had heard VCS Mining Inc. was bringing jobs, along with paved roads and electricity, to this corner of rural northern Haiti.\n\u201cThere will be little interest until the mining law issues are resolved,\u201d he said.\nTopics: From the Wires, NewsCAP-HAITIEN, Haiti (AP) \u2014 The 50-year-old man from the village scrambled up a grassy hill to ask the onsite manager of a U.S. mining company for work.\nBut the new era in mining that some had predicted remains out of reach because the Haiti has been unable to enact a revised mining law establishing such fundamental issues as the environmental regulations and royalty revenues.\nMining giant Newmont Mining Corp., which was studying Haiti for potential sites in partnership with Eurasian Minerals Inc., suspended active exploration in the country in 2012, according to spokesman Omar Jabara."}
