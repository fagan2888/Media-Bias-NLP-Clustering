Ben was a seventeen-year-old high school dropout with blonde hair buzzed down to stubble. He liked smoking cigarettes and drinking beers with his buddies in the alley. We kept a close eye on Ben, but never felt too worried. He was polite and quiet and we generally liked him. That was, until, he attempted to grow marijuana on our garage roof and made me feel like Attorney General Eric Holder.\n\nI knew from firsthand experience that most crimes committed by a seventeen-year-old are of the boneheaded nature. I, myself, was arrested for loitering in my tiny hometown in Ohio when I was Ben\u2019s age. I knew a thing or two about dumb crime. Which was what made this even more uncomfortable.\n\nOn a recent Sunday, I called my mother to chat. Midway through our talk I told mom I had to go, something looked weird atop the garage.\n\nKeep in mind, our one-car garage was in the backyard, had a flat roof and was no more than eight-feet high. So, it was pretty obvious when there was a large green flower pot atop it. A flower pot we didn\u2019t own. A flower pot we didn\u2019t own and didn\u2019t put there.\n\nMy wife and I had been cautioned by a neighbor weeks earlier that Ben had been getting into backyards and acting suspicious. It took about three seconds to guess who had likely placed this plant life atop our shingles.\n\nWe dug out the ladder, climbed the roof, and discovered this wasn\u2019t a bouquet of daisies delivered to our roof by some FTD snafu. Inside our little gift pot was, well, the gift of pot. I\u2019d never grown weed, but had seen enough Grateful Dead tapestries to get an idea of what we were dealing with.\n\nFrankly, I was a little jealous of our neighborhood Snoop Dogg. This kid was raising big, hearty, healthy-looking crops while I couldn\u2019t grow decent cherry tomatoes to save my life.\n\nSome folks would have started cycling through brownie recipes before getting this little bundle down from the garage. But my wife and I had a tougher time deciding what to do. Should we have laughed or should we have been responsible taxpayers who call the police? The situation was not unlike the current battle between state and federal authorities on whether or not to criminalize pot that was recently legalized in Washington and Colorado.\n\nI consider myself open minded. If someone wants to grow weed, knock yourself out. Times are tough, we all need to get creative with money-making. But I had my hands full with a rotting crop of cherry tomatoes, so I didn\u2019t really want my garage being used to rub my nose in someone else\u2019s agricultural success.\n\nThe repercussions were also clear. Our state, Kentucky, had not legalized marijuana last November like Colorado and Washington. If a passerby discovered this plant and phoned the police, we would have been in trouble. Everybody knows the old, \u201cHonest, officer, I didn\u2019t know there was marijuana growing on my roof,\u201d defense hasn\u2019t worked for decades.\n\nOur hearts said to play it cool, but our mortgage-paying brains said to play it safe. It was not unlike the Justice Department wrestling match that was just recently settled, saying: \u201cThe Justice Department said it won\u2019t challenge state laws that legalize marijuana and will focus federal enforcement on serious trafficking cases and keeping the drug away from children.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "It's not easy living next door to the Jesse Pinkman of weed -- especially when he's growing on your own garage roof", "author": "Patrick Wensink", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "It's not easy living next door to the Jesse Pinkman of weed -- especially when he's growing on your own garage roof", "title": "My neighbor, the wannabe drug lord", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2013/10/05/two_bongs_dont_make_a_right_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/10/larger-pot-cannabis.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "It's not easy living next door to the Jesse Pinkman of weed -- especially when he's growing on your own garage roof", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/10/larger-pot-cannabis.jpg", "title": "My neighbor, the wannabe drug lord", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "My neighbor, the wannabe drug lord", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, America, Breaking Bad, Drugs, Pot, teens, The Weeklings, Walter White", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde4b6\"", "article_summary": "That was, until, he attempted to grow marijuana on our garage roof and made me feel like Attorney General Eric Holder.\nSo, it was pretty obvious when there was a large green flower pot atop it.\nA flower pot we didn\u2019t own and didn\u2019t put there.\nA flower pot we didn\u2019t own.\nMy wife and I had been cautioned by a neighbor weeks earlier that Ben had been getting into backyards and acting suspicious."}
