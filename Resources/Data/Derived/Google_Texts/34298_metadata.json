Bennie Thompson (Miss.) on Thursday wrote a letter to Attorney General Loretta Lynch criticizing the delayed program, which civil rights advocates allege unfairly targeted Muslims.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThompson questioned why the FBI, as a law enforcement agency, was involved in efforts to prevent extremism before it takes root, and \u201cpursuing programs to expand its reach into America\u2019s classrooms.\u201d\n\nHaving teachers assist the federal program would \u201cchill relationships with students,\u201d warned Thompson, who is a former school teacher, and \u201cundermine a supportive learning environment.\u201d\n\n\u201cPut simply, turning teachers into intelligence gather[ers] and investigators has questionable value as a strategy for countering terrorism or violent extremism,\u201d he wrote, and may cause students to turn \u201caway from that one person, a teacher, who might be able to make a difference.\u201d\n\nThe scrutiny from Capitol Hill comes after civil rights advocates and Muslim leaders raised alarm at the program, which originally appeared ready to be unveiled this week.\n\nThe \u201cDon\u2019t Be a Puppet\u201d interactive program reportedly was intended to help teachers and students detect and prevent early signs of extremism, but came under fire this week when critics accused it of focusing largely on Muslims.\n\nAccording to reports in The New York Times and The Washington Post, people who had used the program worried that it could lead to discrimination against followers of Islam and people of Arab descent.\n\nAccording to the reports, the program indicated that someone with an Arabic name talking about going on \u201ca mission\u201d overseas would be considered suspicious, even though it could be an innocuous trip.\n\nIn his letter, Thompson did not make explicit reference to allegations that the \u201cDon\u2019t Be a Puppet\u201d program is focused almost exclusively on Islamic extremism.\n\nThe program was reportedly originally scheduled to go online as soon as Monday, but has been \u201ctemporarily suspended,\u201d Thompson noted in his letter.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Rep.
