Watch the parade of Christmas characters, decorated Dutch peddler carts, and caroling bands march past downtown Pella's Dutch buildings to the Tulip Toren. At the end of the procession looms a large ship carrying Sinterklaas and his helper Piets. An annual Sinterklaas party at the Pella Opera House follows the parade when Sinterklaas reads from his book of good children (who get Dutch chocolate). Then it's time for holiday songs, stories and visits with Sinterklaas. 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Saturday, Nov. 28, in downtown Pella and at the Pella Opera House, 611 Franklin St., Pella, Iowa. Admission for the breakfast is $10; the parade is free. pellahistorical.org or (641) 628-4311.\n\nA horse of a different color\n\nEnjoy the easy drive to the American Saddlebred Capital of the World, Shelbyville, Kentucky, where rolling hills and more than 90 historic Saddlebred horse farms and training facilities are waiting for your best photo shots. You can get a rare peek into the show horse world for free because there is no cost for a tour when you stay in Shelbyville/Shelby County lodging accommodations. Stop in the new designer outlet mall, Outlet Shoppes of the Bluegrass, and the impressive Wakefield-Scearce Galleries, offering one of the largest collections of English antique furniture and silver in the nation.

The Abbey Resort may offer an antidote with its 7th Annual Tree Lighting Ceremony, including cocoa, candy canes, Christmas music from the Lake Geneva Symphony Orchestra Ensemble, festive refreshments and a visit from Santa Claus. If you can't make it the day after Thanksgiving, the four weekends leading up to Christmas offer holiday activities such as: Christmas movies in the on-site theater; Santa's Workshop crafts for all ages; A Holly Jolly Christmas Carnival of games, activities and crafts including cookie and gingerbread house decorating; Yuletide Bonfires with s'mores and cider; and a Brunch with Santa offered every Sunday. Tree lighting is 6 p.m. Saturday, Nov. 28, at the Abbey Resort in Fontana, Wisconsin. theabbeyresort.com or (800) 709-1323.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Build a gingerbread house at Chicago's Millennium Park, or see the wreathing of the lions outside the Art Institute.
