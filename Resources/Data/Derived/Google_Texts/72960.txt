ANDREA MITCHELL: How many more people, how many millions of people do you expect will be enrolled in health insurance? What would you consider a successful marker?



KATHLEEN SEBELIUS: The congressional budget office, Andrea, projected 7 million newly insured by the end of the first open enrollment period. Weâ€™re kind of shooting for that target. That includes not only the federal marketplace with the plans that are offered, but also various state marketplaces. I think the notion that we had just on the federal marketplace, over a million people before 7:00 a.m. this morning, It's an indication of how eager people are for real information, to get the facts, to do some shopping themselves. So healthcare.gov is the website. Thereâ€™s also a call center. 1-800-318-2596. 1-800-318-2596. People can call on the phone. And we have translators available in up to 150 languages to answer questions, help people understand some of the terminology.Â



This is a brand-new day for millions of Americans, some of whom were in the rose garden with the president just a few minutes ago. People who have preexisting health conditions or lost their insurance when they lost their job or have had a difficult time just paying for coverage because they don't have employer-based coverage. They talked in a very human and compelling way to the president about what a change this will make in their lives, how much security they will have, how they won't have to worry again about literally declaring bankruptcy or losing a house because they get sick. Thatâ€™s what this bill is all about.
