Via the Star Ledger:\n\nThe appeals judges said the investigator's testimony at [Deberel] Rogers' trial \"was improper,\" adding that the state Supreme Court \u201cconsidered and disapproved of the practice of eliciting opinion testimony from an officer involved in the investigation that led to a defendant\u2019s prosecution for drug distribution.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe judges acknowledged that Rogers\u2019 attorney did not object to the line of questioning and testimony by the investigator. They also said the prosecutor may not have known about the limitations on expert testimony involving investigating officers in drug cases, but that the judge should have excluded the remarks.\n\n\n\nThere was \u201csignificant evidence\u201d to support Rogers\u2019 conviction of cocaine possession, but the distribution charge could have involved others in the apartment and the opinion testimony could have prejudiced the jury, the appellate decision said.\n\n\n\nThe judges upheld Rogers conviction for possession of cocaine and remanded the case back to New Brunswick for a new trial.\n\nThe artificial distinction between a quantity of narcotics that would qualify for personal use and a quantity that qualifies for \u201cdistribution\u201d is at the crux of the Obama Administration\u2019s snail\u2019s pace effort at drug sentencing reform; the Department of Justice this summer instructed prosecutors to omit the quantity of narcotics involved in \u201clow-level\u201d drug cases to avoid the harsh mandatory minimums that kick in at arbitrary amounts.\n\nMore Reason on drug sentencing.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "Prosecutors in NJ not allowed to seek opinion testimony from cops involved in a case", "title": "NJ Appellate Court Overturns Felony Drug Charge for Woman Serving 10 Year Sentence Over 1.2 Ounces of Cocaine", "url": "http://reason.com/blog/2013/12/26/nj-appellate-court-overturns-felony-drug", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/13881000141519.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Two judges in New Jersey\noverturned the conviction of a woman found guilty of possession of\ncocaine with intent to distribute.
