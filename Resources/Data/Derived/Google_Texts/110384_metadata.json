(Photo: JAMES BRUGGERS/THE COURIER-JOURNAL)Buy Photo\n\nFriends and family came to Seneca High School Saturday to celebrate the lives of the three teenagers who were killed two weeks earlier at a railroad crossing.\n\nThey came to the United States as children from refugee camps in Nepal just a few years ago. At a community memorial service, they were remembered as students, brothers, sons, friends, soccer players, and citizens of Louisville who made contributions to the community, and were preparing to make their marks on the world.\n\n\"These were fine young men with promising futures,\" said Seneca High School Principal Kim Harbolt.\n\nTheir car on March 14 had collided with a train at Crawford and Buechel avenues. Months earlier, public officials had flagged the crossing as needing safety improvements and had planned to build crossing gates there.\n\nThe three were current and former Jefferson County Public Schools high school students: Chita Chuwan, 16; Suk Man Rai, 19; and Nagin Thapa, 17. One other occupant of the vehicle, Kismat Mishra, a student at Waggener High, survived but remains in the hospital.\n\nThey had attended different schools, including Seneca, Fern Creek and Iroqois high schools.\n\nPrayers of recovery were sent to Mishra by several speakers, including Basanta Phuyel, a Fern Creek High School student.\n\n\"Everyone is thinking about you in the hospital,\" he said.\n\nThe crash brought great grief to the local Bhutanese and school communities and organizations like Catholic Charities and Kentucky Refugee Ministries that welcomed the boys and their families to Louisville.\n\nMore than 150 people attended the memorial service, which was led by the Bhutanese Society of Kentucky in English and Nepali languages. The society formed in 2009, as more Bhutanese families settled in the area.\n\n\"We miss you our brothers,\" said Prem Sunuwar, vice president of the society. \"We are very saddened. There is nothing to mend our broken hearts, other than to say goodbye forever.\"\n\nBhim Koirala, public relations coordinator for the society, told the gathering that the accident rate for refugee communities in the United States is high. He said a new life in the United States brings many opportunities, but functioning in a new environment isn't easy.\n\nDarko Mihaylovich, a Catholic Charities program director, said he would welcome new discussions with city and other local officials on how to improve safety for resettled teenagers.\n\nAdrienne Eisenmenger with Kentucky Refugee Ministries said all four had been playing soccer together the night before the fatal crash.\n\nMihaylovich said work has begun on organizing a memorial soccer tournament next year to remember the three players who died.\n\nDevi Subedi, founder of the Bhutan-American Sports Council, described all four as great team players who exhibited good sportsmanship.\n\n\"Our hearts go out to these departed souls,\" he said.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://cjky.it/1bFpflj", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Friends and family came to Seneca High School Saturday to celebrate the lives of the three teenagers who were killed two weeks earlier at a railroad crossing.", "og": {"site_name": "The Courier-Journal", "description": "Friends and family came to Seneca High School Saturday to celebrate the lives of the three teenagers who were killed two weeks earlier at a railroad crossing.", "title": "Teens killed in train crash remembered", "url": "http://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/local/2015/03/28/teens-remembered-love-soccer-familes-friends/70611222/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/courier-journal.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Friends and family came to Seneca High School Saturday to celebrate the lives of the three teenagers who were killed two weeks earlier at a railroad crossing.", "creator": "@courierjournal", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/7a77d0a95483fef792b500c4b5eb8a0ca916a941/c=0-0-640-640&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/Louisville/2015/03/28/B9316738347Z.1_20150328194953_000_G76ABOOQF.1-0.jpg", "title": "Friends, family remember Seneca High School teens killed by train", "site": "@courierjournal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600030236", "fb": {"app_id": 128534137209813}, "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Places/Seneca High School", "gci-asset-type": "story", "gci-categories": "Places/Seneca High School", "title": "Teens killed in train crash remembered", "author": "James Bruggers", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "news/local", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/dc8823957ef0912313628c3e1ee2e91e112cbb6e/c=80-0-560-640/local/-/media/Louisville/2015/03/28/B9316738347Z.1_20150328194953_000_G76ABOOQF.1-0.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/40563753e733f006a3a37cede09510c35d2c19a1/c=0-0-640-640/local/-/media/Louisville/2015/03/28/B9316738347Z.1_20150328194953_000_G76ABOOQF.1-0.jpg", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/ee631e62365a4ff3c41b23ff00559b988a5a70d8/c=0-80-640-560/local/-/media/Louisville/2015/03/28/B9316738347Z.1_20150328194953_000_G76ABOOQF.1-0.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/ba79cb80aa413606d28fd425a609e084a6256c55/c=0-140-640-500&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/Louisville/2015/03/28/B9316738347Z.1_20150328194953_000_G76ABOOQF.1-0.jpg", "publishtime": "2015-03-29T11:07:12.770000-04:00", "shorthed": "Teens killed in train crash remembered", "articleid": 70611222, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/a73c80a13a2d5797c679fe67136f8988553a0e0a/c=0-140-640-500/local/-/media/Louisville/2015/03/28/B9316738347Z.1_20150328194953_000_G76ABOOQF.1-0.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/1b2fff9247c940531364d59c1dc37eb4a5e0e2db/c=140-0-500-640/local/-/media/Louisville/2015/03/28/B9316738347Z.1_20150328194953_000_G76ABOOQF.1-0.jpg"}}, "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/james.bruggers"}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": "Teens memorial, Seneca High School, Fern Creek High School, Waggener High School, Jefferson County Public Schools, Kentucky Refugee Ministries, Bhutanese Society of Kentucky, Kim Harbolt, Catholic Charities, Louisville Train crash,"}, "article_summary": "\"These were fine young men with promising futures,\" said Seneca High School Principal Kim Harbolt.\n(Photo: JAMES BRUGGERS/THE COURIER-JOURNAL)Buy PhotoFriends and family came to Seneca High School Saturday to celebrate the lives of the three teenagers who were killed two weeks earlier at a railroad crossing.\nPrayers of recovery were sent to Mishra by several speakers, including Basanta Phuyel, a Fern Creek High School student.\nThe three were current and former Jefferson County Public Schools high school students: Chita Chuwan, 16; Suk Man Rai, 19; and Nagin Thapa, 17.\nMihaylovich said work has begun on organizing a memorial soccer tournament next year to remember the three players who died."}
