Buck McKeon gives the Weekly Republican Party Remarks\n\nHello, I\u2019m Buck McKeon, chairman of the House Armed Services Committee. For all the focus on disagreements in Washington, we\u2019ve actually found some common ground this week. (Scroll down for video of these remarks.)\n\nOn Thursday, President Obama signed legislation that guarantees death benefits for the families of fallen troops will continue to be paid out during the government shutdown. We\u2019ve also come together to ensure that members of our military and the civilians who support them will be paid no matter what.\n\nWe shouldn\u2019t stop there.\n\nThe House has passed more than a dozen bills providing funding for things we can all agree on.\n\nVeterans, cancer research, National Guard, national parks, Head Start, food safety, flight safety, border security, nuclear weapon security, and more. President Obama and Senate Democrats should back these bills immediately. Then the president should work with us on plans to reopen the entire government and make sure we do not default on our debts.\n\nAfter all, sitting down and resolving our differences is exactly what Americans expect their leaders to do \u2014 especially at times like this.\n\nTo that end, a group of House Republicans, including myself, went to the White House on Thursday to talk with the president and see where we can find common ground. Those conversations are continuing.\n\nNow, I\u2019m sure all this back-and-forth has sounded like the typical Washington drama. But politics isn\u2019t about politicians. It isn\u2019t about Washington. It\u2019s about you and your family.\n\nIt\u2019s about building an economy that generates good-paying jobs and real prosperity.\n\nIt\u2019s about making sure there\u2019s fairness for everyone under the president\u2019s health care law \u2014 so that hardworking people like you get the same relief that big businesses have received.\n\nIt\u2019s about stemming the tide of debt and deficits that threatens to wash out an entire generation\u2019s opportunities. And it\u2019s about ensuring our troops in harm\u2019s way, and their families, are taken care of, the same way they take care of us at home.\n\nPreserving the American Dream. That\u2019s what this is about.\n\nAnd the longer we go on settling for maybe-next-time, for this notion that putting things off until after the next election is okay, the harder this will get.\n\nIt\u2019s a challenge, but we can do this. Let\u2019s get back to work, together. Thank you for listening. ####\n\nRELATED:\n\nHard truths: Obama\u2019s report card so far\n\nThe real shutdown goals of Barack Obama\n\nFinally!
