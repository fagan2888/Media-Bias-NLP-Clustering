To add their son, Torin, to their insurance would cost $700 to $900 a month.\n\n\u201cWe just can't afford that,\u201d said Thomson. \u201cThat's for one child.\"\n\nSo they were thankful last year to sign up for a Blue Cross Blue Shield PPO for only $220 a month through the Affordable Care Act.\n\nBut that plan was just canceled, and the only alternative is an HMO -- a plan their beloved pediatrician won't take because she would have to agree to work for lower rates.\n\n\u201cI trust her,\" said Thomson. \u201cI think she's fantastic and I don't want to change.\"\n\nCarol Bell-Walton also got a cancelation notice in the mail.\n\nBefore the Affordable Care Act, she had a subsidized PPO for people with pre-existing conditions. That ended with the Affordable Care Act and she moved to a different PPO with Blue Cross Blue Shield, which is now offering her an HMO with the same monthly premium. However, she would have to give up at least one of her doctors.\n\n\u201cWhich one would you choose, the one you had a 25-year relationship with who delivered your baby or\u2026the one that's changed your health so dramatically?\u201d said Bell-Walton.\n\nFOX 4 sat down with Dr. Dan McCoy, the chief medical officer of Blue Cross Blue Shield of Texas.\n\n\u201cIs the Affordable Care Act not working out as planned?\u201d said FOX 4\u2019s Lori Brown.\n\n\u201cIt's in its infancy stages,\u201d said McCoy. \u201cIt's certainly going to be a long journey. When you look at the number of Texans insured under the Affordable Care Act, that's a good thing.\u201d\n\nMcCoy says Blue Cross lost $400 million on the PPO marketplace plans, making them unsustainable.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, we have really escalating medical costs in this country,\u201d said McCoy. \u201cIt's not just a combination of healthy people and sick people; it's that we have to control overall health care costs.\u201d\n\n\"It shouldn't be this hard or expensive for everyone to have health care,\u201d said Thomson.\n\nA study found that insurance companies across the country are dropping PPOs in the marketplace for 2016.\n\nWhile many often see the insurance companies as the bad guys, Blue Cross points out that insurance companies are prohibited by law from earning more than 15 percent in profit.\n\nHowever, on the flip side, health care providers and pharmaceutical companies have no profit cap.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Hundreds of thousands of Texans are scrambling to find health insurance after Blue Cross Blue Shield of Texas cut its individual PPO plans.", "author": "FOX", "og": {"site_name": "KDFW", "description": "Hundreds of thousands of Texans are scrambling to find health insurance after Blue Cross Blue Shield of Texas cut its individual PPO plans.", "title": "BCBS of Texas cuts individual PPO plans", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://static.lakana.com/media.fox4news.com/photo/2015/11/12/bcbs_1447369158362_474440_ver1.0_640_360.jpg", "height": 360}, "url": "http://www.fox4news.com/news/48163325-story", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "http://www.fox4news.com", "description": "Hundreds of thousands of Texans are scrambling to find health insurance after Blue Cross Blue Shield of Texas cut its individual PPO plans.", "title": "BCBS of Texas cuts individual PPO plans", "image": {"src": "http://static.lakana.com/media.fox4news.com/photo/2015/11/12/bcbs_1447369158362_474440_ver1.0_640_360.jpg"}, "creator": "KDFW", "site": "KDFW", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 503199139730327}, "keywords": "News,Home", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "BCBS of Texas cuts individual PPO plans News BCBS of Texas cuts individual PPO plans Hundreds of thousands of Texans are scrambling to find health insurance after Blue Cross Blue Shield of Texas cut its individual PPO plans.\nHundreds of thousands of Texans are scrambling to find health insurance after Blue Cross Blue Shield of Texas cut its individual PPO plans.\nFOX 4 sat down with Dr. Dan McCoy, the chief medical officer of Blue Cross Blue Shield of Texas.\nBlue Cross Blue Shield is based in Richardson, and the insurer's chief medical officer says PPO plans under the Affordable Care Act were simply hemorrhaging way too much money.\nSo they were thankful last year to sign up for a Blue Cross Blue Shield PPO for only $220 a month through the Affordable Care Act."}
