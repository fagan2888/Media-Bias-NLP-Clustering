It's legal when most drugs are not, but it's just as toxic,\" Dr. Ablow said of video games, which are not classified as drugs in any country.\n\nLater, Dr. Ablow compared video games to having \"an open bar in the house or lots of drugs.\"\n\nDr. Ablow made the same claims recently on \"Fox & Friends\" (video below).\n\nBoth times Dr. Ablow cited a \"recent\" study that found \"watching violent video games increases aggression and decreases empathy.\"\n\nThe author of the study that Dr. Ablow referred to, Ohio State University professor Brad Bushman. does claim that video games may be a \"contributing factor\" to gun violence, but wrote in the New York Post:\n\n\n\nWe haven\u2019t \u201cproven\u201d video games directly cause violence because it can\u2019t be proven. There is no way to ethically run experiments that see if some threshold of playing a violent game like Call of Duty may push a person into violence.\n\nBoth Dr. Ablow and MacCallum lamented the lack of mental health services for disturbed people, but neither mentioned how Fox News has always opposed Obamacare, which will provide more access to mental health services for Americans.\n\nNo one on Fox News mentioned that mass murder has existed for centuries, long before video games and that other counties have the same video games as America, but do not have the same high number of gun-related deaths as the U.S.\n\nSource: MediaMatters.org and New York Post", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#0e0e0e", "p": {"domain_verify": "4e3a17d2b19ae614286124438d4e37ce"}, "description": "Fox News host Martha MacCallum and frequent contributor Dr. Keith Ablow say that video games, not guns, are to...", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "title": "Fox News Blames Video Games for Mass Shootings, Not Guns (Video)", "modernizr-version": "2.8.3", "foundation-version": "5.4.7", "jquery-version": "2.1.1", "og": {"url": "http://www.opposingviews.com/i/society/crime/fox-news-blames-video-games-mass-shootings-not-guns-video", "image": "http://www.opposingviews.com/", "type": "article", "description": "Fox News host Martha MacCallum and frequent contributor Dr. Keith Ablow say that video games, not guns, are to...", "title": "Fox News Blames Video Games for Mass Shootings, Not Guns (Video)"}, "DC.date.issued": "2013-09-14T00:00:33+00:00", "theme-version": "1.2.4", "publish_date": "2013-09-14T00:00:33+00:00", "msapplication-TileImage": "/sites/all/themes/ov_foundation/img/favicons/ms-icon-144x144.png", "theme-color": "#0e0e0e", "ov": {"id": 772154}, "viewport": "width=device-width, maximum-scale = 1.0"}, "article_summary": "During today's interview, MacCallum called for confiscating non-lethal, non-weapon video games, while Dr. Ablow said \"guns are irrelevant\" to mass shootings, noted MediaMatters.org (video below).\nFox News host Martha MacCallum and frequent contributor Dr. Keith Ablow say that video games, not guns, are to blame for the mass shootings in America.\ndoes claim that video games may be a \"contributing factor\" to gun violence, but wrote in the New York Post:We haven\u2019t \u201cproven\u201d video games directly cause violence because it can\u2019t be proven.\nBoth times Dr. Ablow cited a \"recent\" study that found \"watching violent video games increases aggression and decreases empathy.\"\nMacCallum claimed that video games were the common thread in three mass murderers: James Holmes, Jared Lochner and Adam Lanza."}
