Paul LePage, and its recommendations came after forums in 20 Maine communities attended by more than 1,500 people. Its findings were issued at a Friday event at the Maple Hill Farm Inn in Hallowell.\n\nBut they won\u2019t be unanimous, particularly the report\u2019s calls for expansion of health care to people with substance abuse disorders under the federal Affordable Care Act and increased access to an overdose antidote, both of which have been opposed by the Republican governor.\n\nThe collaborative was led by U.S. Attorney Thomas Delahanty, Maine Attorney General Janet Mills and John Morris, LePage\u2019s public safety commissioner. It focused on prevention, treatment and law enforcement.\n\nThe Legislature took steps to address opiates in 2016, including enacting a LePage bill limiting opiate prescriptions with some exceptions and requiring doctors to check a monitoring program before prescribing opiates, expanding access to naloxone, which reverses potentially fatal overdoses, and putting $3.7 million toward hiring more drug agents and other services.\n\nOther efforts fell short. The Legislature failed to pass a bill to expand Medicaid to an estimated 60,000 Mainers, similar to proposals that have been vetoed by LePage, citing potential future costs.\n\nThe bill expanding access to naloxone passed over LePage\u2019s veto, with the governor saying the drug \u201cdoes not truly save lives\u201d but \u201cmerely extends them until the next overdose.\u201d\n\nGordon Smith, executive vice president of the Maine Medical Association, said Medicaid expansion would provide services to 12,000 people with substance abuse disorders, calling it \u201cthe single most significant thing people could do right now\u201d to fight addiction.\n\nOther recommendations in the report included the following:\n\n\u2014 The creation of a state-level position coordinating state and local responses to opiate use.\n\n\u2014 Funding new employees in Maine\u2019s eight public health districts to work on education, prevention and intervention services in schools and communities.\n\n\u2014 Expanding Maine\u2019s medication-assisted therapy infrastructure, reducing wait times for methadone treatment, which was 70 days in central Maine in 2016\u2019s first quarter.\n\n\u2014 Studying the expansion of Maine\u2019s drug treatment courts, which are in Washington, York, Androscoggin, Hancock and Cumberland counties.\n\n\u2014 Increasing prosecutions of out-of-state drug dealers by 100 percent in 2017, in part by better intelligence sharing between state and local police.\n\n\u201cWe need to implement the recommendations and find ways to make them work,\u201d Delahanty said. \u201cSome will be easier than others, some will take time, many are expensive and some might be controversial.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "To fight Maine\u2019s opiate crisis, the state should expand health care access and drug courts, better connect people to services and increase prosecution of out-of-state drug dealers, according to a report released Friday by a stakeholder group.
