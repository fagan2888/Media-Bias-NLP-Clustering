It is a cycle that is not an accurate reflection of America, and it has to stop.\u201d\n\nBoth Ryan and McConnell have criticized Trump before, for the real estate mogul\u2019s calls for mass deportation of millions of illegal immigrants, the barring of Muslims from entering the country, and -- for a brief time -- failing to denounce a white supremacist group that was touting his candidacy.\n\nRelated: The GOP\u2019s Last, Best Hope to Stop Trump?\n\nDuring a radio appearance on Monday in Wisconsin, Ryan described the video images of violent skirmishes between pro and anti-Trump forces over the past week as \u201cvery concerning.\u201d He said that candidates must \u201ctake responsibility for the environment at their rallies,\u201d according to CNN.\n\n\"All candidates have an obligation to do what they can do to try and provide an atmosphere of harmony, to reduce the violence, to not incite violence and to make sure that we are appealing to people on their best ideals, that we are going to unite the country around ideas,\" Ryan said.\n\nMeanwhile, McConnell told reporters today that he had directly urged Trump to condemn violence at his rallies. McConnell said he delivered that message during a phone call that Trump instigated earlier this morning in what appeared to be an effort to pull the badly splintered GOP together behind his candidacy.\n\n\"I mentioned to him that I thought it would be a good idea for him no matter who starts these violent episodes to condemn it,\" McConnell said, according to The Hill.\n\nCongressional leaders were in an uproar last weekend following media reports that a Trump supporter sucker-punched a black protester in North Carolina and that Trump was forced to cancel another rally in Chicago on Friday after his supporters and protesters loyal to Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont threw punches and engaged in pushing contests that could have led to serious injuries.\n\nRelated: As Outrage Turns to Violence, Trump Won\u2019t Moderate His Message\n\nTrump refused to condemn the violence or soften his rhetoric, and instead blamed Sanders, the democratic socialist presidential candidate, and his supporters for disrupting his events and forcing him to cancel\u2019s Friday night\u2019s event.\n\nIt would be an understatement to say that Obama doesn\u2019t get along with Ryan and McConnell, and that the two top Republican leaders regularly condemn the president\u2019s domestic and foreign policy agenda and performance. Both men have vowed to help shred many of Obama\u2019s chief accomplishments, including the Affordable Care Act, the Iran nuclear deal and Obama\u2019s climate change initiatives to shut down utilities and industries that burn coal.\n\nBut the two congressional leaders are highly wary of Trump, who has criticized them in the past as the personification of political status quo and even warned that there would be consequences for Ryan if the Speaker chose not to go along with him if he is elected president. \u201cI don\u2019t know him well, but I\u2019m sure I\u2019m going to get along great with him, and if I don\u2019t \u2013 he\u2019s gonna have to pay a big price,\u201d Trump said at a Palm Beach news conference.\n\nRyan later said he pretty much laughed off the threat. But clearly he and McConnell share Obama\u2019s stated concerns about the dangerous path that Trump and his most rabid supporters are following.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "In a season of extreme hyper-partisanship, it took the provocative and divisive behavi", "title": "It Took Trump to Bring Obama and GOP Leaders Together", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/03/15/It-Took-Trump-Bring-Obama-and-GOP-Leaders-Together", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/washington_dc_flickr_richard_ricciardi.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/03/15/It-Took-Trump-Bring-Obama-and-GOP-Leaders-Together", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/washington_dc_flickr_richard_ricciardi.jpg", "creator": "@ericpianin", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "In a season of extreme hyper-partisanship, it took the provocative and divisive behavi", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "In a season of extreme hyper-partisanship, it took the provocative and divisive behavior of GOP presidential frontrunner Donald Trump to bring President Obama and the two top congressional Republican leaders together this week in a rare display of unanimity.\nMeanwhile, McConnell told reporters today that he had directly urged Trump to condemn violence at his rallies.\nBut clearly he and McConnell share Obama\u2019s stated concerns about the dangerous path that Trump and his most rabid supporters are following.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen misguided attempts [by protesters] to shut down that speech, however offensive it may be,\u201d Obama said during a St. Patrick\u2019s Day luncheon on Capitol Hill.\nIt would be an understatement to say that Obama doesn\u2019t get along with Ryan and McConnell, and that the two top Republican leaders regularly condemn the president\u2019s domestic and foreign policy agenda and performance."}
