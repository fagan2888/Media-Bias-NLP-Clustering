No recession since the Great Depression has have the same kind of toll on the social and economic fabric of the United States as this recent one. Per analysis from the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, this recession has been the longest period of economic contraction since 1933. Gross domestic product fell by 5 percent at its lowest point and non-farm employment by 6.3 percent, while the labor force participation rate (the percentage of Americans working or actively looking for a job) fell from 66 percent in December 2007 to 63.2 percent in August 2013, with a restoral to pre-recession employment numbers not expected until Spring 2015 \u2014 an unprecedented seven years after the job losses started.\n\nIn this extended period of unemployment \u2014 despite high levels of business productivity and record market profits \u2014 lies a disconnect that has the potential to disrupt job security and expose to mistreatment of the most vulnerable within the workforce.\n\nRecently, the nature of the nation\u2019s economic recovery has been called into question. While the stock markets are regularly breaking records and the wealthiest Americans have significantly improved their financial posture \u2014 with the top 1 percent seeing an income boost of more than 11 percent \u2014 recent research, such as a February economic study from the University of California-Berkeley, shows that the income of the bottom 99 percent actually dropped 0.4 percent during the recovery period.\n\n\n\nofficial MintPress sponsor official MintPress sponsor\n\nEmmanuel Saez, a researcher at UC-Berkeley, concluded that \u201cthe Great Recession has only depressed top income shares temporarily and will not undo any of the dramatic increase in top income shares that has taken place since the 1970s.\u201d\n\nDespite the slow growth in job creation and the pay stagnation, something wholly illogical has happened: the nation\u2019s productivity has spiked. According to the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics, the latest reporting shows an output increase from the nonfarm business sector of 3.7 percent for second quarter 2013, while the number of hours worked for all persons only increased 1.4 percent. In the manufacturing sector, output dropped 0.6 percent, while hours worked of all persons dropped 2.4 percent.\n\nWhat this correlation represents is an unusual facet of recession economics: when times are bad, productivity goes up. Productivity is defined as the amount of work done by a company or industry divided by the number of hours reported to do that work. Typically, in times of economic hardship, companies reduce their workforce to balance their books. The remaining workers tend to find themselves pressured \u2014 explicitly and implicitly \u2014 to maintain the same level of output with fewer people working. Out of concern for losing their jobs or through the motivation to meet established goals, the average worker works harder and for longer under recession conditions.\n\nThis creates a situation in which employers are seeing productivity goals being met with fewer workers, which further encourages less hiring.\n\nThe \u201cunemployment conundrum\u201d\n\n\u201cWe find that worker effort is directly related to local unemployment rates,\u201d wrote Edward Lazear, co-author of the National Bureau of Economic Research working paper \u201cMaking Do With Less: Working Harder During Recessions,\u201d for Investor\u2019s Business Daily. \u201cStudying a multi-location service company where detailed measures of productivity are available, it is found that establishments located where there was high unemployment enjoyed significantly higher productivity than in areas where there was low unemployment. In fact, about two-thirds of the increase in productivity that occurred in this firm during the recession could be attributed to the additional effort that resulted from the higher unemployment rate of 2007-2009.\u201d\n\n\u201cHigh unemployment makes workers more determined to keep the jobs that they have, and they enhance their chances of remaining employed by working harder,\u201d Lazear continued. \u201cThis means fewer new hires.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is fascinating about this study is that the increase in productivity that occurred during the last recession is a consequence of making do with less \u2014 the quality of the workforce at the firm we study hardly changed,\u201d said Christopher Stanton, a co-author of the study. \u201cThis is evidence that in areas where unemployment is high, workers are responding to the reduced likelihood of obtaining an alternative job and, therefore, working harder to keep the one they have.\u201d\n\nAccording to a 2011 survey of more than 300 North American companies, two-thirds of all employees reported working longer hours than they did three years prior. One-third reported taking less vacation or personal time off. Nearly one-half of all employers recognized that the demand for greater productivity is disrupting the employees\u2019 work-life balance and may be contributing to an unhealthy situation.\n\nForcing productivity\n\nWhile many businesses are not hiring due to uncertainty about the economics \u2014 particularly in light of the political flux surrounding implementation of the Affordable Care Act \u2014 others are not hiring because they don\u2019t have to. An example of this occurred in April, when over 6,000 Dollar Tree employees filed suit against the company on the claim that the company routinely made employees work \u201coff the clock.\u201d\n\nThe suit, filed in the United States District Court in Norfolk, Va., stated that \u201cIn an effort to provide low-cost merchandise to its customers and still maximize profits, defendant Dollar Tree has engaged in a policy, pattern or practice of requiring its thousands of hourly associates and assistant managers to work without pay, in several ways.\u201d The workers claimed that Dollar Tree \u2014 the nation\u2019s largest dollar-or-less retailer \u2014 often forced continued work through unpaid lunch breaks, despite being \u201coff the clock.\u201d Most workers reported, in addition, being forced to work 30 to 45 minutes over their shifts daily unpaid.\n\nAccording to Dollar General\u2019s most recent annual report, the company has eight pending lawsuits against it, including four federal wage-and-hour violations. If the class is certified, as many as 275,000 current and former workers since 2009 could join the suit.\n\nThese types of abuses seem to be endemic. It has been estimated that Walmart is the defendant in 5,000 lawsuits per year on average, most of which deal with alleged wage theft. A recent example is the case of Schneider Logistics \u2014 in which Walmart is their sole customer \u2014 that has been accused in a January lawsuit of cheating as many as 1,800 workers out of millions of dollars. It was alleged that Schneider and two staffing agencies failed to keep proper payroll records, falsified time sheets and misled employees on their earned payroll.\n\nTeamsters for a Democratic Union has reported that the International Brotherhood of Teamsters has won a number of wage theft cases, including a settlement for 4,000 Illinois UPS drivers to receive $7.25 million in back pay, an affirmation by the New Jersey Supreme Court of a lower court decision that route drivers were not sales personnel and therefore were entitled to overtime pay, a $3 million settlement with Taco Bell for \u201coff-the-clock\u201d work by employees in Washington State and a $3.1 million judgment against Tyson/IBP for not paying for pre-production and post-production work.\n\nSusceptibility of low-income workers\n\nThose most unlikely to find replacement work in a tight job market \u2014 the under-educated, the unskilled and workers in high unemployment areas \u2014 tend to be exploited the most, as they have the most to fear from unemployment. Those working develops a sense of gratitude for the work they have, which manifest as a fear of termination and a drive to meet or exceed expectations. Goals are being met with fewer people, so hiring slows, which re-enforces the fear of not finding a new job if terminated.\n\n\u201cAn increase in the unemployment rate makes finding an alternative job more difficult, which reduces the relative cost of effort,\u201d said Stanton. It\u2019s possible that less productive workers are most responsive to recessions and increases in local unemployment rates because their alternatives diminish the most during weak economic times.\u201d\n\nWith 21 states not expected to reach full employment until at least 2015, and three \u2014 Nevada, Michigan and Rhode Island \u2014 which will not see full recovery until at least 2018, per analysis from IHS Global Insights, the dangers of all of this are real. Without full employment, income will stay stagnant or may even drop in light of employment demand, while the number of wage-and-hour violations will continue to increase.\n\nThe recovery for the middle class cannot happen until competition for employees forces wages to rise and this cannot happen until hiring thaws. This will ultimately require a commitment from the government and from the nation\u2019s wealth-holders toward making investments that both create jobs and increase demand for American goods and services.\n\n\u201cProductivity growth is essential to ensure that the American worker\u2019s standard of living will be higher in the future than it is today,\u201d wrote Lazear. \u201cAt the same time, we suffer a double whammy from high unemployment. Not only does unemployment mean that fewer are working, but those with jobs work harder and crowd out employment opportunities for others. We need to both improve productivity growth, which although positive still lags normal rates, while at the same time increase employment.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "One counterintuitive result of a recession is that workers are under more pressure \u2014 much to the delight of employers., Great Recession, productivity, unemployment, wage theft, Walmart,", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "AUTHOR": "Frederick Reese", "og": {"site_name": "MintPress News", "description": "One counterintuitive result of a recession is that workers are under more pressure \u2014 much to the delight of employers., Great Recession, productivity, unemployment, wage theft, Walmart,", "title": "Why Workers Are More Productive During Periods Of High Unemployment", "url": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/workers-are-more-productive-during-periods-of-high-unemployment/169531/", "image": "http://mnpprodpublic.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/092313_jobs_16x9-690x388.jpg", "updated_time": "2013-09-24T01:31:03-05:00", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "One counterintuitive result of a recession is that workers are under more pressure \u2014 much to the delight of employers., Great Recession, productivity, unemployment, wage theft, Walmart,", "creator": "@FrederickReese", "image": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/092313_jobs_4x3.jpg", "title": "Why Workers Are More Productive During Periods Of High Unemployment", "site": "@MintPressNews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"admins": 100003161352196}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/MintpressNewsMPN", "section": "Daily Digest", "tag": "Walmart", "published_time": "2013-09-24T05:00:05-05:00", "modified_time": "2013-09-24T01:31:03-05:00"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc951e\"", "article_summary": "Why Workers Are More Productive During Periods Of High UnemploymentOne counterintuitive result of a recession is that workers are under more pressure \u2014 much to the delight of employers.\nWe need to both improve productivity growth, which although positive still lags normal rates, while at the same time increase employment.\u201d\nNot only does unemployment mean that fewer are working, but those with jobs work harder and crowd out employment opportunities for others.\nThis creates a situation in which employers are seeing productivity goals being met with fewer workers, which further encourages less hiring.\n\u201cAn increase in the unemployment rate makes finding an alternative job more difficult, which reduces the relative cost of effort,\u201d said Stanton."}
