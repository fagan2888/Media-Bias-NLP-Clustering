Amazon doesn\u2019t care.\n\nOn May 10, the New York Times reported that, as part of an effort to negotiate better contractual terms from Hachette, Amazon had been for months making it difficult for Amazon users to purchase books by Hachette writers. Books that normally would be delivered in two or three days now required two or three weeks. Banner advertisements on author pages added insult to injury by promoting \u201csimilar books for lower prices.\u201d Hachette authors exploded in criticism, and even some longtime defenders of the company, like the New York Times technology columnist Farhad Manjoo, called the behavior an \u201cugly spectacle to behold.\u201d\n\nBut so far, Amazon hasn\u2019t backed down, and that\u2019s nothing short of amazing \u2014 not to mention troubling.\n\nAmazon has historically been extraordinarily sensitive to bad press, lest it run the risk of encouraging consumers of its services to think twice about the online giant. Everything Jeff Bezos does, so the story goes, puts the consumer front and center. So when Amazon says \u2014 as it did in a press release this week detailing its side of the business dispute with Hachette \u2014 that \u201cwe regret the inconvenience,\u201d we\u2019re suddenly in new, uncharted, alien territory.\n\nAmazon even advised prospective book buyers to seek better service from its competitors!\n\nThe company\u2019s enormous self-confidence comes through even clearer at the conclusion of its press release, in the form of a link to an opinion piece that Amazon says \u201coffers a wider perspective\u201d on the issue. The blog post, written by the co-founder of a small literary publisher, attacks the New York Times reporters who broke the story for their \u201calarmist zeal,\u201d calling their article \u201cpoppycock\u201d and dismissing the public reaction as a \u201ckerfuffle of rage.\u201d\n\nThink about that for a second. To convey its opinion more fully, Amazon directed readers to wildly biased rant. Tell us how you really feel, Jeff Bezos!\n\nThe screed does make one useful point by noting how, in the past, chain bookstores and big distributors were hardly angelic in their dealings with publishers. As my colleague Laura Miller noted in her own piece about the Hachette controversy, it wasn\u2019t so long ago that the big New York publishing houses were screaming bloody murder about arm-twisting from Barnes & Noble and Borders.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Can't buy books by Colbert and Gladwell?
