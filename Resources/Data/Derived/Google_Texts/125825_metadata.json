The very fact that Wolfson could conceive of such a paper was itself testament to the efforts of countless gay and lesbian advocates before him, operating in far more difficult circumstances.\n\nA good place to start in assessing the prehistory of the marriage equality movement is the Mattachine Society, one of the first gay organizations in the United States. Founded in Los Angeles in 1950, the Mattachine Society ultimately included chapters around the country, and in the 1950s and 1960s was the nation\u2019s leading gay organization. It took its name from masked critics of ruling monarchs in medieval France. At its inception, the very idea of a gay organization was so radical that the group met only in secret.\n\nThe Mattachine Society\u2019s most illustrious member was Frank Kameny, a Harvard-educated astronomer who was fired by the US Army Map Office in 1957 when an FBI investigation revealed that he was gay. Kameny appealed his firing all the way to the Supreme Court, without success. But the experience prompted him to become one of the nation\u2019s first openly gay activists. He founded the Washington, DC, chapter of the Mattachine Society in 1960, and also launched a systematic attack on the federal government\u2019s discrimination against gay and lesbian employees. Notwithstanding his lack of legal training, Kameny operated as a \u201clawyer without portfolio,\u201d assisting hundreds of employees in administrative appeals of their dismissals and shepherding their cases through the courts. With the support of the ACLU, he won his first victory in 1965, when the US Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit reversed the Civil Service Commission\u2019s disqualification of Bruce Scott from the civil service on grounds of \u201cimmoral conduct.\u201d In 1975, after many more battles with Kameny, the Civil Service Commission reversed its policy of categorically disqualifying gay and lesbian applicants. Kameny also took on the Defense Department for denying security clearances to gays and lesbians, and in 1975 it, too, abandoned that practice.\n\nThe first challenge Kameny and the Mattachine Society faced was simply to be free to associate as gay men. Sodomy statutes made intimate relations between same-sex couples a crime. Psychiatrists considered homosexuality a mental illness. Admitting publicly that one was gay or lesbian could result in ridicule, harassment, assault, isolation from one\u2019s family, the loss of a job, or worse. Most gays and lesbians understandably chose to keep their sexual orientation hidden.\n\nThe invisibility of the \u201ccloset\u201d made mobilizing for lesbian and gay rights all but impossible. Thus, the first strategic step toward achieving equality was, as gay rights scholar and advocate Bill Eskridge has called it, a \u201cpolitics of protection.\u201d The aim was to create space for gays and lesbians to come together without fear of official harassment. Gay and lesbian community centers, bars, and bathhouses all served this function. The Stonewall riots of 1969, in which gay patrons at a Greenwich Village bar turned on police and collectively asserted their right to be out, gay, and together in a public place, were the most dramatic and historic manifestation of this initial phase.\n\nThe next step was to make it safe\u2014or at least, less costly\u2014to \u201ccome out\u201d by publicly identifying oneself as lesbian or gay. Gay rights groups fought for legal protections that would make it more likely that gay men and lesbians might feel sufficiently comfortable to identify themselves publicly. The ACLU Lesbian and Gay Rights Project, for example, invoked the First Amendment to protect the rights of students to form gay and lesbian student associations, first in colleges and later in high schools. And gay rights advocates argued for expanding anti-discrimination laws to prohibit discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation in employment, housing, and other fields.\n\nIn the 1980s, the AIDS crisis transformed the gay community. Many men were in effect outed by the disease itself as it afflicted them or their lovers. The life-or-death necessity for research and treatment spawned the creation of new advocacy organizations, such as Gay Men\u2019s Health Crisis and ACT UP, as gay men and lesbians increasingly recognized the pressing need for nondiscriminatory health services, and came to understand that only through political organizing could they convince the government to invest sufficient resources in developing effective treatments. In a tragic but real sense, gay rights came out and of age during the AIDS crisis, as growing numbers of gays and lesbians proclaimed their sexual orientation publicly, joined political associations, and en- gaged in collective action to demand equal care and respect.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Countless gay rights advocates worked the legal as well as the cultural angles to get us to where we are today", "title": "The long, winding road to marriage equality: From the Mattachine Society to ACT UP to \u201cEllen,\u201d they all helped make it possible", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Countless gay rights advocates worked the legal as well as the cultural angles to get us to where we are today", "title": "The long, winding road to marriage equality: From the Mattachine Society to ACT UP to \u201cEllen,\u201d they all helped make it possible", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2016/03/27/the_long_winding_road_to_marriage_equality_from_the_mattachine_society_to_act_up_to_ellen_they_all_helped_make_it_possible/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/03/gay_pride_parade1981.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Countless gay rights advocates worked the legal as well as the cultural angles to get us to where we are today", "title": "The long, winding road to marriage equality: From the Mattachine Society to ACT UP to \u201cEllen,\u201d they all helped make it possible", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/03/gay_pride_parade1981.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "David Cole", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Books, Evan Wolfson, Gay Rights, Mattachine Society, Stonewall riots", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Topics: Books, Evan Wolfson, Gay Rights, Mattachine Society, Stonewall riots, Life NewsThe path to marriage equality did not begin, of course, with Evan Wolfson\u2019s Harvard Law School paper.\nThe first challenge Kameny and the Mattachine Society faced was simply to be free to associate as gay men.\nA good place to start in assessing the prehistory of the marriage equality movement is the Mattachine Society, one of the first gay organizations in the United States.\nAnd gay rights advocates argued for expanding anti-discrimination laws to prohibit discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation in employment, housing, and other fields.\nFounded in Los Angeles in 1950, the Mattachine Society ultimately included chapters around the country, and in the 1950s and 1960s was the nation\u2019s leading gay organization."}
