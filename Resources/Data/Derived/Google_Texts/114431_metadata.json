Lamar Alexander\u2019s case, he sits down at a borrowed piano in his Capitol Hill office and, with a grin, bangs out \u201cThe Memphis Blues.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s been blending music and politics his whole life. And this coming week, the three-term Tennessee Republican hopes Democrats and the GOP harmonize as the Senate becomes Alexander\u2019s stage.\n\nThe son of a school teacher and principal, this former federal education secretary and onetime university president will be shepherding a bill he\u2019s been working on for seven years: a rewrite of the contentious No Child Left Behind law.\n\nAlexander acknowledges \u201cgetting a little emotional\u201d when his polarized committee \u2014 the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee \u2014 approved the measure unanimously this spring. \u201cBut,\u201d he said in an interview, \u201cI\u2019m going to save my emotions until we get a presidential signature.\u201d\n\nThe carefully balanced legislation is a long way from becoming law and faces an uncertain future in the House. But it\u2019s perhaps the most consequential shot Alexander will have at a lifelong effort to loosen the federal government\u2019s grip on public schools.\n\n\u201cLegacy, to him is not, \u2018I need to do something so people will remember my name,'\u201d said Democrat Phil Bredesen, who, like Alexander, is a former Tennessee governor who made education a priority. \u201cFor him, it\u2019s that, \u2018I need to leave a mark that will do good things in the future.'\u201d\n\nFor the 75-year-old Alexander, the bill\u2019s success would punctuate a legislative career fueled by pragmatism and the drive for results, a sharp contrast to new GOP colleagues such as Sens. Ted Cruz of Texas and Rand Paul of Kentucky, who have blocked legislation and are proud of it.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., holds up the product of Alexander\u2019s negotiations with his Democratic co-sponsor, Sen. Patty Murray of Washington state, as a model for the way he wants the Senate to work under GOP control.\n\n\u201cI think the way he navigated a committee that has the most liberal members of the Senate and a few of the most conservative, to get to this point, is why I was willing to give this issue floor time,\u201d the schedule-setting McConnell said in a recent interview. \u201cIn my job, floor time is the coin of the realm. It means that I have confidence that the underlying bill is going to succeed.\u201d\n\nThe proposed rewrite stands on the premise that states and localities are better positioned to assess their own school performance than what Alexander calls the \u201cnational school board\u201d created by the 2001 law that Republican President George W. Bush championed.\n\nIt helped that Republicans and Democrats \u2014 and the army of teacher and education lobbyists swarming around the rewrite \u2014 agree on that general idea, Alexander says. The turning point came earlier this year as Republicans assumed control of the Senate, when Murray suggested that she wanted to get an agreement.", "article_metadata": {"description": "New tune for piano-playing senator: Revised education policy", "title": "New tune for piano-playing senator: Revised education policy", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "New tune for piano-playing senator: Revised education policy", "title": "New tune for piano-playing senator: Revised education policy", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/07/04/new_tune_for_piano_playing_senator_revised_education_policy/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/07/lamars-legacy-.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "New tune for piano-playing senator: Revised education policy", "title": "New tune for piano-playing senator: Revised education policy", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/07/lamars-legacy-.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Laurie Kellman", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1989\"", "article_summary": "Alexander acknowledges \u201cgetting a little emotional\u201d when his polarized committee \u2014 the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee \u2014 approved the measure unanimously this spring.\nAnd this coming week, the three-term Tennessee Republican hopes Democrats and the GOP harmonize as the Senate becomes Alexander\u2019s stage.\nIt helped that Republicans and Democrats \u2014 and the army of teacher and education lobbyists swarming around the rewrite \u2014 agree on that general idea, Alexander says.\nTopics: From the Wires, News, Politics NewsWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 How does a musician-senator fill the time during yet another partisan Senate stalemate?\nThe turning point came earlier this year as Republicans assumed control of the Senate, when Murray suggested that she wanted to get an agreement."}
