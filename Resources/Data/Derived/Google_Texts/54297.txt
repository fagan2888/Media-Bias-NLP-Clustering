NASHVILLE, Tenn. (WATE) — A new report says the number of uninsured people in Tennessee has continued to drop.

According to a report by the University of Tennessee Center for Business and Economic Research, Tennessee has hit a 10-year low, with the number of uninsured dropping to 6.6 percent. Dr. LeAnn Luana, who co-authored the report, says the downward trend began in 2013, coinciding with the availability of the health insurance marketplace established as part of the Affordable Care Act.

The study also looks at TennCare recipients, showing that enrolees increasingly choose doctors’ offices and clinics versus hospitals and emergency departments. It shows that in 2015 a larger share of TennCare enrollees reported receiving information from TennCare. This information includes enrollment cards, information on filing appeals, a list of rights and responsibilities, and the name of their managed care organization.

“Although TennCare enrollees are less likely than all households to seek initial care at a doctor’s office or clinic, significantly more initially sought care at those providers in the current survey (94 percent) than in 2014 (90 percent),” said Luna.

The number of uninsured children also saw a drop by more than half since 2013. According to the study, 98.5 percent of children are currently uninsured.
