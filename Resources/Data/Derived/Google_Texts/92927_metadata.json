This data, submitted into what is referred to as an EDGE server environment, is used by HHS to make risk adjustment and reinsurance calculations. Each plan is required to deploy and manage an EDGE server for such data submission under very strict technical specifications, with the data playing a key role in their financial performance calculations.\n\n\"The first-year setting for the ACA presented real-world challenges for healthcare organizations looking to navigate the fluid technical specifications of the HHS data reporting environment,\" said Dan Rizzo, chief innovation officer of Inovalon, \"Our implementation of the HHS-compliant EDGE server solution in a cloud-based, SaaS model proved to be an excellent demonstration of Inovalon's end-market expertise in healthcare data integration, normalization, and analysis \u2013 providing for rapid capability responsiveness across all EDGE servers as updates were released from HHS and new data phenomina emerged within the marketplace. We are proud to be working together with such an array of industry leaders and great partners, as part of their success and dedication to providing superior care for their members.\"\n\nInovalon's EDGE server solution (known as eCAAS Advantage\u00ae), provides a comprehensive electronic claims aggregation, analysis, and submissions platform. Ensuring its commercial ACA partners meet HHS regulatory compliance and technical specifications, the eCAAS Advantage\u00ae EDGE server solution supports the distributed data collection approach for both risk adjustment and reinsurance reporting through a cloud-based, software as a service (or \"SaaS\") model. An important component of Inovalon's solution is that it empowers health plans with on-going risk adjustment accuracy and reinsurance analyses of its member-level datasets that support reconciliation with the HHS EDGE server calculations. The solution also includes an innovative, issuer-facing workflow resolution tool that allows for industry-leading transparency into the data validation and submission process, reduces cycle times for data correction, and increases file processing throughput. Further, Inovalon's iPORT\u2122 data integration toolset attaches to the front end of the eCAAS Advantage\u00ae solution to provide industry-wide data normalization and comparative analysis capabilities unavailable anywhere else in the industry. The eCAAS Advantage\u00ae platform is also available in a cloud-based, SaaS version supporting the Medicare Advantage requirements for Encounter Data Submission (EDS) data submissions to CMS.\n\nAbout Inovalon\n\nInovalon is a leading technology company that combines advanced cloud-based data analytics and data-driven intervention platforms to achieve meaningful insight and impact in clinical and quality outcomes, utilization, and financial performance across the healthcare landscape.
