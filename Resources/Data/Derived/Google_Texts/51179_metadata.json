So we \u2014 and I \u2014 need something different in there. Everything needs to change.\u201d\n\nShari Pizarro, 49, a Democrat who works as a waitress in St. Petersburg, Fla., said she voted Democratic but had few hopes for Washington \u2014 now or in the future. \u201c I have no clue what\u2019s going on in D.C., but what I do know is that you can\u2019t really trust anyone,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s all screwed up no matter who\u2019s in the White House.\u201d\n\nAnd in Racine, Wis., Jeffrey Kowalczuk, a 56-year-old account representative for a trucking company, seemed no less disillusioned than Ms. Pizarro after voting for Republicans in that critical state. \u201cI\u2019m just tired of all the fighting and bickering,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re all Americans. It\u2019s just getting old with all that stuff.\u201d\n\nThe interviews came in an election in which many analysts were expecting a notably low turnout, reflecting the distress many people have voiced about the state of the government. Again and again, voters said they were exhausted after having been deluged with attack advertising on television, emails pleading for money and election pamphlets clogging their mailboxes. Such bombardments only reinforced their disenchantment with Washington, they said.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no such thing as a good politician, I\u2019m sorry,\u201d said Christi Miller, 43, an Obama supporter from Hot Springs, Ark. \u201cThey may start out that way, but I think once you get in and once you get painted with bribes, and you have to take care of the people who contributed to you. ... \u201d Her voice trailed off. \u201cThey would care if they were actually running for office for the right reasons,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re running for office for money and power.\u201d\n\nIn New Hampshire, Jennifer Giles, 48, a Republican, said she thought candidates spent too much time worrying about their own futures. \u201cI think people are much too focused on getting re-elected instead of doing their job,\u201d she said.\n\nPhoto\n\nSome voters blamed both sides of Pennsylvania Avenue for the problem. \u201cIt\u2019s as dysfunctional as you probably can get,\u201d said Ken Berra, 60, a Democrat and lawyer in Kansas. \u201cYou have a president who unfortunately is a lightning rod \u2014 the Republicans, no matter what he does, don\u2019t like it.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nKenneth Haynes, 60, offered a similar view as he came to vote at Luling Elementary School in Luling, La. \u201cThey\u2019re always calling each other the bad guy when they\u2019re all the bad guy,\u201d he said.\n\nStill, for the most part, views on who was to blame were, not surprisingly, divided based on party line. \u201cI\u2019m not a huge fan of Obama, but I do think he came in trying to compromise, and he was stymied,\u201d said Bronwyn Williams, 53, a Democrat and a professor of English at the University of Louisville, as he cast a vote in Kentucky, where Mitch McConnell held on to his Senate seat. Mr. Williams added, \u201cI do think there are Republicans who are interested in good governance, but Mitch McConnell isn\u2019t one of them.\u201d\n\nWarren Sloan, 45, a mechanic, voted Democratic in the Georgia election and said that although he blamed both parties for the battling, he faulted Republicans more.\n\n\u201cEverybody\u2019s doing their part,\u201d Mr. Sloan said. \u201cBut one thing I\u2019ve noticed about the Republican Party \u2014 and I\u2019ve listened to Rush Limbaugh and Sean Hannity for years \u2014 is they can tell you what you\u2019re doing wrong, but they can\u2019t come up with a better solution.\u201d\n\nMidterm Elections 2014 The latest news, analysis and election results for the 2014 midterm campaign.\n\nAnn Halloran, 72, an independent who said she had voted for Republicans as she left the polls in Salem, N.H., called Mr. Obama \u201cthe driving force that has caused us to go in the wrong direction, and hopefully these people are going to be the ones that are going to take a step back.\u201d\n\nThe issue that the White House might have expected to boost Democratic candidates \u2014 the economy, which by many measures is in far better condition than it was even two years ago \u2014 may have in fact proved to be a negative for the president and his party. In preliminary exit polls of voters conducted by Edison Research, a large majority of voters described the national economy in negative terms and most said the United States economic system favored the wealthy.\n\n\u201cThe economy is terrible,\u201d said John Madron, 61, who has been unemployed since 2009, after casting his vote in this community outside Denver. \u201cEspecially for manufacturing. I\u2019ve been in manufacturing all my life, and right now, I\u2019m unemployed. There\u2019s no positions throughout this country because it\u2019s all been outsourcing.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Madron said he voted for Mr. Obama when he first ran for president in 2008, but after that voted Republican.\n\nThe public resentment toward Washington went beyond the people in charge; voters in states that had been at the center of these battles said they had been overwhelmed by advertisements paid for by wealthy donors.\n\n\u201cSince they\u2019ve allowed all the money in politics, it\u2019s gotten much worse,\u201d said Scott Hasson, 40, a photographer who lives in Denver. \u201cEveryone says our vote matters, but until we can check the system and start taking a lot of that money out, I feel like it\u2019s just power, people with money have the power.\u201d\n\nThe exit poll showed most Americans disapproved of Mr. Obama, and that clearly hurt Democratic candidates. \u201cObama has not accomplished what he promised to the community,\u201d said Juan Neyra, 69, a retired security guard in Denver. He said he used to vote for Democrats, but this year had voted for the Republican Senate candidate, Representative Cory Gardner, who was challenging Senator Mark Udall, a Democrat. \u201cAnd Udall supports Obama,\u201d Mr. Neyra said.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20141104203930, "twitter": {"description": "Some voters said that after watching the infighting in Washington,
