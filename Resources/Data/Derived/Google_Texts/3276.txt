One man died Sunday after a boating accident at North Sterling Reservoir in far northeastern Colorado, the region’s fire chief said.

Sterling Fire Chief Kurt Vogel said the man was unconscious and did not register any vital signs when firefighters found him in the water shortly before 7 p.m. Paramedics immediately began performing CPR and loaded the man into an ambulance, but Vogel said the man was later pronounced dead at the hospital.

Vogel said the man was a middle-aged adult, but he didn’t have the man’s name or age.

An emergency call came in at 5:22 p.m. Sunday about a boating accident at the reservoir, which is 12 miles north of Sterling, Vogel said. When crews arrived, they found one man on shore, uninjured. His boating companion, however, was missing, and a fire department dive team soon began looking for him.

Vogel said the circumstances of the accident are still unclear. Neither man was wearing a life vest, he said.

“People need to be safe out on the water,” Vogel said. “And they have to wear life vests.”
