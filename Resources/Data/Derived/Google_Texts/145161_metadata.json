Bloomberg News\n\nBefore a House rules change in January, CBO generally had not applied \u201cdynamic scoring\u201d to major legislation, or considered likely macro-economic effects when analyzing a bill\u2019s potential impact on the deficit. On Friday, in response to follow-up questions from a January congressional hearing, CBO said that had it conducted such an analysis of Obamacare, it would have found that the bill reduced the federal deficit by less than its original projections.\n\nIn short: Because CBO believes the health-care law will discourage work, it would lower federal revenues\u2014but the agency did not consider the revenue impacts of these effects in 2010, when it projected that the law would reduce the federal deficit.\n\nAlthough CBO does not usually estimate macroeconomic effects of major bills, it has done this. In 2013 the agency \u201crelaxed\u201d its score-keeping convention with respect to immigration legislation in the Senate, concluding that the bills under consideration would increase the labor supply and economic growth and thus federal revenues. Both the 2013 Senate immigration bill and Obamacare would have altered the U.S. workforce by millions of workers. That CBO went to great lengths to estimate the macroeconomic and fiscal effects of Senate legislation never enacted but has yet to do so with Obamacare raises questions about the agency\u2019s policies for scoring legislative measures.\n\nCBO has conducted two analyses of the health-care law\u2019s impact on labor markets, but these did not say that the law\u2019s effects on the labor force would impact its potential deficit reduction. The first analysis, released in August 2010, said that Obamacare would reduce the workforce by about half a percent, or approximately 800,000 workers, by 2021. The second analysis, released in February 2014, roughly tripled that estimate, to 1.5% to 2% of the labor force\u2014the equivalent of approximately 2.3 million workers in 2021. CBO could have publicly stated that these labor-force changes, and the related revenue effects, would negatively affect the deficit, even if it could not specify by how much.\n\nCBO said last summer that it would no longer produce estimates for the fiscal impact of the health law as a whole. It also declined to release a score of legislation repealing the law before last month\u2019s House vote. In a blogpost last June, Mr. Elmendorf wrote that CBO and the Joint Committee on Taxation \u201chave no reason to think that their initial [March 2010] assessment that the ACA would reduce budget deficits was incorrect.\u201d But the agency\u2019s statement on Friday illustrates that the 2010 deficit assessment was incomplete and could be incorrect. CBO appears to have no intention of correcting this flaw or revealing Obamacare\u2019s true fiscal impact.\n\nCBO\u2019s statement Friday was released to select congressional offices the same day Keith Hall was named as Mr. Elmendorf\u2019s replacement. As CBO\u2019s past analyses of Obamacare\u2019s impact on the labor market received much press fanfare, the down-playing of this information seems straight out of \u201cThe West Wing.\u201d\n\nOne hopes that under Dr. Hall\u2019s leadership CBO will address a few issues, including a revised score of Obamacare that accounts for the legislation\u2019s impact on labor markets and a broader discussion about the need to consider macroeconomic effects when analyzing bills as large in size and scope as the 2,700-page health-care law. CBO is accountable to Congress and taxpayers; it can act accordingly starting with more transparency.\n\nChris Jacobs is policy director of America Next, a conservative think tank.
