Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, confirming Rebecca Ebinger to a lifetime appointment as a district judge in Iowa.\n\nGrassley, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, brokered the deal in December: His committee would advance three of President Obama\u2019s liberal nominees for federal judgeships in exchange for Democrats\u2019 support of two other judges from Iowa, Grassley\u2019s home state.\n\nIn the weeks before Ebinger\u2019s confirmation Monday, the Senate gave the green light to three judicial nominees, including Wilhelmina Wright, a judge who in her youth accused the Reagan administration of bigotry and racism.\n\nApproved by a vote of 83 to 0, Ebinger will serve as U.S. District Court judge for the Southern District of Iowa. Seventeen senators failed to show up to vote, including 13 Republicans.\n\n>>> See how your senator voted:\n\nGrassley used the opportunity to praise Ebinger, calling her \u201cexceptionally talented and qualified.\u201d As part of his December deal, Grassley also secured a Senate confirmation vote on Leonard Strand as a U.S. District Court judge in Iowa.\n\n\u201cI said this in committee, but for the benefit of all my colleagues, the Iowa nominees are two of the best judicial candidates the president has nominated during his presidency,\u201d Grassley said. \u201cJudges Strand and Ebinger have the highest credentials and character and will serve the state of Iowa with honor and distinction.\u201d\n\nEbinger spent time working in the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office in Iowa and was later appointed, then elected to be a district judge in Iowa state court. Her confirmation leaves Strand as the lone nominee awaiting a vote from Grassley\u2019s deal.\n\nPressure has been mounting on Senate Republicans to halt confirmation of all judicial nominees. Led by Heritage Action, some want to freeze the process in protest of what they consider ongoing executive overreach. Others contend that the process already is too political.\n\nThis story was updated to include additional information about Ebinger and comments from Grassley.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Iowa's Chuck Grassley made a deal to confirm five of President Obama's judicial nominees.
