Stephen Colbert welcomed overnight celebrity and French economist Thomas Piketty on “The Colbert Report” to discuss his book, “Capital in the Twenty-First Century,” in which Piketty proposes a progressive global tax system to increase economic mobility. Of course, this type of policy threatens the wealth of the top 1 percent — including Colbert’s right-wing blowhard persona. In protest (and, probably, to keep things light), Colbert has grown a (sparse) goatee to show solidarity with fictional billionaire “Iron Man’s” Tony Stark.

“If Piketty had his way, and Tony was coughing up 80 percent in taxes, suddenly he’s not a billionaire anymore and can’t afford to be Iron Man. Then who’s saving New York from the Chitauri invasion?” Colbert challenged the economist, who smells, to Colbert, a lot like a communist.
