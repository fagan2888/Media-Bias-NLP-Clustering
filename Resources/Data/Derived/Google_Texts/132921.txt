The winners of Saturday night's Distinguished Young Woman competition for Meridian and Lauderdale County are still processing the news.

Hannah Davis is the winner for Meridian and Morgan Ross is the winner for Lauderdale County. The girls stopped by WTOK on Sunday afternoon to talk about now preparing for the upcoming state competition, which will take lots of talent and interview practice. But the girls say they are grateful for the experience they've had so far.

"My favorite part about the whole experience was while we were waiting to deliberate and decide who won the program, all the girls were backstage together and we were singing High School Musical songs," Davis recalls.

"Most people don't like fitness, but I do," Ross remembers. "And my favorite part was spending every Sunday with the new friends I've met and practicing fitness."

Davis and Ross are best friends and say it's exciting to be taking part in this adventure together.
