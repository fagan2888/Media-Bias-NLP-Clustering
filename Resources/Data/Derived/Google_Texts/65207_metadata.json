That would be a 10% increase over a year earlier. There\u2019s also a streak to keep alive: Disney has beaten EPS expectations in each of the last 10 quarters.\n\nSales: Disney is expected to post revenues of $13.17 billion, up 6% from $12.46 billion a year ago. The company has topped FactSet consensus on revenue in nine of the last 10 quarters. Analysts expect $4.25 billion of Disney\u2019s revenue to come from its parks and resorts, followed by its cable networks at $4.07 billion.\n\nRead: Why Disneyland deserves 60th birthday wishes\n\nShare Price: Trading close to $120, shares of Disney are up 28% so far this year, handily beating the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which is down 1%. Analysts covering the stock on FactSet have an average price target of $121.92 and an overweight rating. The most bullish analyst has a price target of $150, while the most bearish is at $98.\n\nOther Issues: Disney has had lots of success at the box office so far this year. The company\u2019s film distributor, Buena Vista, has the second-largest market share among film studios, after Comcast Corp.\u2019s CMCSA, +0.96% Universal\u2019s $1.9 billion. Movies like \u201cAvengers: Age of Ultron\u201d and \u201cInside Out\u201d have helped Disney rake in $1.3 billion in box-office receipts.\n\nOne thing to look for on Tuesday will be any news of another likely Disney hit: \u201cStar Wars: The Force Awakens\u201d is set to debut Dec. 18.\n\n\u201cAs expectations begin to ramp from \u2018Star Wars\u2019 we look at how to benchmark the film compared to \u2018Avatar\u2019 and some of the other recent global blockbusters,\u201d Stifel Nicolaus analyst Benjamin Mogil wrote in a recent note. \u201cIn aggregate, we believe that the film can gross around $2.2 billion globally.\u201d\n\nThat could top \u201cTitanic,\u201d now the second-highest grossing movie globally of all time, without accounting for inflation, at $2.18 billion. \u201cAvatar\u201d is the highest-grossing with $2.8 billion.\n\nOne of the biggest unknowns is when the movie will be released in China, an increasingly important market for film studios, Mogil said. China has increased its screen count 400% since 2009, he said.\n\nOne headwind for Disney is the foreign-exchange rate in many markets when revenue is converted back into dollars, Mogil said. The stronger U.S. currency means it will take more of the local currency to buy the same amount of dollars.\n\nAnother issue to watch for is Disney\u2019s plans for ESPN. Disney Chief Executive Bob Iger told CNBC last week that the sports channels eventually will move toward becoming a stand-alone streaming service.\n\n\u201cI think eventually ESPN becomes a business that is sold directly to the consumers,\u201d Iger said.\n\nAccording to Nielsen data, ESPN has lost 3.2 million subscribers in just over a year. A move to offer direct-to-consumer content would certainly push forward the cord-cutting movement. In a lot of eyes, sports content, including live events, is one of the last tethers holding consumers to pay-TV bundles.", "article_metadata": {"lifp_basePath": "https://id.marketwatch.com/access", "twitter": {"domain": "marketwatch.com", "description": "Walt Disney will report third-quarter earnings after the market closes on Tuesday.
