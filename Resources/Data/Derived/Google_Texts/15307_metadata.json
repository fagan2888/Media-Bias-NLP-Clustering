Aside from fatigue and dehydration, none of the divers sustained serious injuries, but they did learn an important lesson.\n\n\"When Mack at Diver's Den said, you know, you need to have a safety observer on your boat all the time,\" said Tom, \"if we had just listened to that one, then we wouldn't be talking to you right now.\"\n\nThe other family involved in the dive rescue has said they're incredibly grateful for all the work the US Coast Guard and other agencies did to ensure they were found.", "article_metadata": {"description": "After a 14 hour ordeal leaves two families stranded in the Gulf of Mexico, one pair speaks about the incident.", "language": "english", "author": "Ashley Arnold", "og": {"url": "http://www.wjhg.com/home/headlines/Rescued-Divers-Speak--222060861.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/466*315/diver+rescue+helicopter.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "After a 14 hour ordeal leaves two families stranded in the Gulf of Mexico, one pair speaks about the incident.", "title": "Rescued Divers Speak on 14 Hour Ordeal"}, "twitter": {"description": "After a 14 hour ordeal leaves two families stranded in the Gulf of Mexico, one pair speaks about the incident.", "title": "Rescued Divers Speak on 14 Hour Ordeal", "url": "http://www.wjhg.com/home/headlines/Rescued-Divers-Speak--222060861.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/466*315/diver+rescue+helicopter.jpg", "creator": "@WJHG_TV", "site": "@WJHG_TV", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "keywords": "Rescued Divers Speak on 14 Hour Ordeal", "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "google-site-verification": "orfdzs_E4bRXom1qluA34zerrmjsg4QfrlLSkrR3ZAQ", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Rescued Divers Speak on 14"}, "article_summary": "Aside from fatigue and dehydration, none of the divers sustained serious injuries, but they did learn an important lesson.\nThe helicopter crew spotted the divers 20 miles off Panama City and transported them to Tyndall Air Force Base for medical attention.\n\"I sat outside and watched the sun go down and knew something was wrong,\" said Andrea Mudge.\nAfter turning back, the Mudge family, accompanied by two other divers, decided to stay in place and wait for a rescue team to arrive - and after 14 hours in the Gulf, it did.\nLittle did Andrea know that her husband and daughter were floating in the Gulf of Mexico waiting for relief after getting separated from their boat."}
