At the age of 12, Woody Thomas, president of Magic Special Events, performed magic shows at birthday parties. By the time he\n\nwas driving, he was doing two birthday shows each Saturday.\n\n\u201cDad was a dentist who used magic to set patients at ease. He showed me some tricks and I got pretty good at them,\u201d Thomas says. \u201cI had a business phone line at 16 and by college I was doing more corporate parties. I left college after 1\u00bd years to help corporations with things like clowns, balloons and dunk tanks. I realized I can only do so many magic shows each day, but I can do multiple events.\u201d\n\nThat began what Thomas refers to as his \u201ccareer in dumpster diving\u201d as he went through what his competitors no longer wanted to find what he was looking for. Several years later, Thomas heard a newer employee tell a customer the company didn\u2019t have what they were looking for. After the call, Thomas found out what the customer was looking for and told the employee they could get it. When the employee protested that he can\u2019t sell what they don\u2019t have, Thomas responded that \u201cthis company was built on selling what we don\u2019t have.\u201d\n\nRepurposing and reinventing has been an integral part of the business plan all along the way. \u201cWe got into balloons when singing telegrams and balloon bouquets were big. Since I was twisting balloon animals as a kid I knew where to buy them. Then the calls came in for balloon drops/releases. I said, \u2018Sure I can do that.\u2019 I didn\u2019t know how, but I figured it out,\u201d Thomas says. While balloons were big business, Thomas eventually transitioned away from them.\n\n\u201cI got out of it because it\u2019s a lot of work with nothing to show for it at the end of the night. I like to reuse things. We made giant sculptures like a 12-ft. flamingo with balloons, but at the end of the night we\u2019d have to pop them all and get rid of it. It was such a waste that all the work went to nothing so that\u2019s when I started building plywood flamingoes we could paint and keep renting. When we were transitioning away from balloons, clients would call and say they need balloons for this or that and I would show them another possibility in a rental item,\u201d Thomas says.\n\nThe costume portion of the business also was a product of evolution. \u201cThere was a time when singing telegrams with gorillas and chickens were big. We had those and then people started calling and asking if we had this costume or that costume. That\u2019s how we got up to 8,000 costumes in our inventory,\u201d he says.\n\nThomas says this learn-as-we-go approach has helped make the company versatile and open to ideas. \u201cBecause we\u2019ve done everything like this, we\u2019ve figured everything out on our own and we can fill a wide range of requests. I just did the first balloon drop in years \u2014 we have all the stuff to do that. It\u2019s not a big deal, but the average company doesn\u2019t know how to start to do that. The evolution of all this is that I\u2019ve liked things fun,\u201d he says.\n\nThe extensive costume collection hangs from the ceiling of the company\u2019s 25,000-sq.-ft. warehouse, along with a variety of novelties, including a multitude of statues, a giant Mardi Gras mask and a life-size horse. In addition to creative use of ceiling space, shelving throughout the warehouse is filled with unique items for any theme, from tropical islands and fairy tales to Hollywood and casinos. Thomas also has dozens of hand-painted 12-ft.-by-40-ft. backdrops to complete the look of an event. In the midst of it all is the work station where items are repurposed or built from an idea. In this place where Aladdin\u2019s lamp becomes a white teapot for an Alice in Wonderland party and horseshoes become Western-themed candle holders, categorizing inventory can be tricky.\n\nWhile such a vast inventory and creative repurposing allow Thomas to produce picnics and parties with almost any theme, he relies on a solid warehouse staff and Party Cad software to keep it organized.\n\n\u201cWe use Party Cad extensively, but we take it to a different level. When I go out for a picnic sales call in another city, I want to make that trip one time. Before I go out I download an aerial photograph. While I\u2019m there I pull up the photograph and take measurements so Party Cad can scale the whole thing. This way, we\u2019re usually able to give a complete rendering in the proposal. If we can show them what their party will look like before the event, that\u2019s a big sell. We also use Party Cad to pull up jobs at common hotels to show what we\u2019ve done there in the past. Even our custom pieces are built into Party Cad so we can easily show them to clients,\u201d Thomas says.\n\nThe program also helps him convey his vision to his employees. \u201cThe first thing I do when I walk into a venue is visualize what the room will look like the night of the party. I visualize the party happening while I\u2019m there. I\u2019ll come back here and do a Party Cad of it or hand-draw it and give it to someone else to put into the system. I want the vision, but I have employees who figure out the details \u2014 how may tables, chairs and other items are needed. I create the look of the party in the software so I can follow it through from the entrance gets this, the prefunction area gets this equipment, we\u2019ll do this vignette over here \u2014 usually our clients don\u2019t see that but it helps our installers visualize the party and understand where everything should go. We attach the Party Cad image of the party to the contract software so we can look at all aspects of the party at once,\u201d he says.\n\nThis approach has helped the company find its niche over the years. \u201cAt one time we were trying to be the all-inclusive rental company with glassware and all that, but it\u2019s just not us,\u201d Thomas says. \u201cOur guys don\u2019t want to count glasses, but they really get into the production meetings and they bring things to the table. It\u2019s really a joint effort with everybody working to pull it all together.\u201d\n\nToday, Thomas continues to build the majority of his business around corporate events and picnics. \u201cWhat I\u2019ve found is that when corporate clients contact us, they\u2019re looking for solutions to problems. We view everything as a challenge and that keeps it interesting for us. Nothing\u2019s fun unless it\u2019s a challenge,\u201d he says.\n\nOne challenge that the company takes on every year is a rigorous schedule of company picnics across eight states. Over the years, Thomas has honed this process to the point where he says that, for the most part, they are turnkey events. His unique approach to staffing large picnics hundreds of miles from his warehouse has made these events run more smoothly and created relationships within communities.\n\n\u201cWe staff each picnic with a few of our guys and a local football team or charity organization. We have two to three trucks on site and start preliminary setup as soon as we arrive. On Friday at 4 p.m., the football team or charity shows up to help with 90 percent of the setup. Saturday morning, the same group comes back to help with the rest of the set up and begin working in the on-site kitchen and serving. The picnic starts at 11:00 a.m., and we serve food and provide fun and games continuously. At 3 p.m. Saturday the event is over and within two hours all the trucks are back on the road. The logistics of hiring a team rather than 80 individuals makes the whole thing easier. You already have a group that can work cohesively and no one wants to be the weak link. In the end, it\u2019s a win-win-win. We win because the work is done efficiently. The group wins because they get a check for more than any other fundraiser they could have done. The company wins because they are the ones who write the check that goes to the volunteer group,\u201d he says.\n\nFor all the challenges, unique requests and time restrictions, Thomas says he loves his work. For him, the payoff is in the big reveal. \u201cTo a lot of people it\u2019s a mystery what we do and how we do it, but to me it\u2019s a day-to-day thing. It\u2019s certainly not like work. I work just about every day because I love it. This is not like many other businesses where if you don\u2019t finish today you can finish tomorrow. This has a start and finish deadline and if you\u2019re not ready at the start, you\u2019re finished. To me the two most exciting things are making the sale and then being there when the party begins. It\u2019s like a show. When the guests arrive it\u2019s like the curtain opening. You want to wow them when they get there,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s something about a show \u2014 and so with the event business \u2014 either you love it or you hate it. There\u2019s not a lot of in between. It\u2019s physically demanding and mentally demanding but the reward is when people walk in and go, \u2018Wow.\u2019\u201d", "article_metadata": {"RATING": "GENERAL", "DESCRIPTION": "Rental Management Magazine", "GENERATOR": "DotNetNuke", "AUTHOR": "Rental Management Magazine", "og": {"site_name": "Rental Management Magazine", "description": "The evolution of&#160; Magic Special&#160;Events&#160; in Richmond, Va., began long before the company was known for its corporate picnics and unique inventory.", "title": "Magic Special Events: Selling what we don't have", "url": "http://www.rentalmanagementmag.com/Art/tabid/232/ArticleId/23338/Magic-Special-Events-Selling-what-we-dont-have.aspx", "image": "http://www.rentalmanagementmag.com/portals/RM/Images/June%202015/Magic-party-feature.jpg", "type": "article"}, "RESOURCE-TYPE": "DOCUMENT", "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "REVISIT-AFTER": "1 DAYS", "COPYRIGHT": "Copyright 2016 by The American Rental Association all rights reserved.", "KEYWORDS": "Rental Management Magazine,DotNetNuke,DNN", "DISTRIBUTION": "GLOBAL", "viewport": "initial-scale = 1.0, maximum-scale = 1.0, user-scalable = no, width = device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb1b2\"", "article_summary": "When the employee protested that he can\u2019t sell what they don\u2019t have, Thomas responded that \u201cthis company was built on selling what we don\u2019t have.\u201dRepurposing and reinventing has been an integral part of the business plan all along the way.\nWhile I\u2019m there I pull up the photograph and take measurements so Party Cad can scale the whole thing.\nWe also use Party Cad to pull up jobs at common hotels to show what we\u2019ve done there in the past.\nWhile balloons were big business, Thomas eventually transitioned away from them.\nThis is not like many other businesses where if you don\u2019t finish today you can finish tomorrow."}
