I found the results of the poll last week about whether diners subtract the percentage of the SF surcharges from the tip if restaurants add a surcharge very interesting. After more than 3,000 people weighed in, it seems that about 2/3 of them lower the tip to account for the surcharge. There were also more than 350 comments.

However, I think there are two facts that many diners don’t consider as to why restaurants might add the surcharge. I mentioned in the previous post that there is no surcharge at Marlowe or Park Tavern, but the third restaurant in the group, The Cavalier, charges 3%.

By looking at the regulation I saw the reason why.

The rate an owner must set aside for Healthy SF goes up if the restaurant employees more than 100. At Marlowe and Park Tavern, they are under 100 so the restaurant accrues $1.63 an hour for each employee. At Cavalier, which is open for three meal services and also provides room service for the Hotel Zetta, the staff is larger than 100 so they have to set aside $2.44 per employee per hour.

Another reason some restaurants add the surcharge is that their rent is often a percentage of their gross. If they were simply to raise prices, their rent would increase; by adding the surcharge, they save money, which in the end save the diner some money.

I don’t think we’ve seen the last of these surcharges, either. They seem to be spreading. I got an e-mail yesterday from a reader pointing me to a story on CBS in Los Angeles about Republique, a new popular restaurant on La Brea which is starting to add a 3% surcharge, attributed to the fact that under the Affordable Care Act every business with more than 50 employees must provide health care.

Looks like San Francisco is again ahead of the curve.
