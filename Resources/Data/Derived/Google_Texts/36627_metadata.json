The short answer is, we don\u2019t know,\u201d says National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration oceanographer Jeremy Mathis, one of the lead writers of the report, which was coauthored by researchers from the University of Alaska and the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution.\n\nAlaska has one of the most productive commercial fishing economies in the world. The state\u2019s fishing industry supports more than 100,000 jobs and brings in roughly $5 billion a year in revenue. Think: pollock, Bristol Bay\u2019s famous sockeye salmon, and crab from the Bering Sea. Apart from that, about 17 percent of Alaskans (around 120,000 people) rely on subsistence fishing for most, if not all, of their dietary protein. Fishery-related tourism also brings in $300 million annually.\n\nThe state\u2019s fisheries management model \u2014 with its focus on sustained yields and public participation in the regulatory process \u2014 is widely recognized as an example of successful natural resource stewardship. But now climate change is posing new and unknown challenges to this model.\n\nThe impact of ocean acidification is far worse in Alaska\u2019s waters because the coastal waters here are cold, and cold water can absorb more carbon dioxide, Mathis told the Earth Island Journal. Also, unique ocean circulation patterns in the region bring naturally acidic deep ocean waters to the surface here. The study focused on assessing the impact on Alaska Native communities because \u201cthe fisheries really are the lifelines of these communities,\u201d Mathis says. \u201cWe want to start thinking about the implications and help them figure out what they can do to prepare for what\u2019s coming.\u201d\n\nThe researchers say that red king crab and tanner crab \u2014 two important Alaskan fisheries \u2014 grow more slowly and don\u2019t survive as well in more acidic waters. Which means that communities in southeast and southwest Alaska, which rely heavily on crab fisheries, and have underlying vulnerabilities \u2014 such as lower incomes and fewer employment opportunities \u2014 face the highest risk.\n\n\u201cIf you look at coastal Alaska, all that the coastal communities have is fishing, and crabs are a big part of it,\u201d says Steve Minor, an Alaska fishing industry veteran who was involved in helping develop the Bering Sea crab program, one of the fisheries that will be impacted. \u201cIf you take fishing away, there\u2019s nothing left. You can\u2019t pack up and move to the next town and work at a Wal-Mart, because there\u2019s nothing there either.\u201d The Bering Sea, the report notes, \u201cdirectly or indirectly provides over 25 million pounds of subsistence food for Alaska residents, primarily Alaska Natives in small coastal communities.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "A new report reveals that keeping fisheries sustainable is going to be a serious challenge in the years to come", "title": "Ocean acidification poses imminent threat to Alaskan fishing communities", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "A new report reveals that keeping fisheries sustainable is going to be a serious challenge in the years to come", "title": "Ocean acidification poses imminent threat to Alaskan fishing communities", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/08/09/ocean_acidification_is_an_imminent_threat_to_alaskan_fishing_communities_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/08/shutterstock_143122369.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A new report reveals that keeping fisheries sustainable is going to be a serious challenge in the years to come", "title": "Ocean acidification poses imminent threat to Alaskan fishing communities", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/08/shutterstock_143122369.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Maureen Nandini Mitra", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Alaska, Climate Change, Earth Island Journal, fisheries, Global Warming, ocean acidification", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc1b1\"", "article_summary": "Photo by Meg J/FlickThe Bering Sea crab fisheries are among the most at risk from ocean acidification.\nAlso, unique ocean circulation patterns in the region bring naturally acidic deep ocean waters to the surface here.\nThe study focused on assessing the impact on Alaska Native communities because \u201cthe fisheries really are the lifelines of these communities,\u201d Mathis says.\nThe impact of ocean acidification is far worse in Alaska\u2019s waters because the coastal waters here are cold, and cold water can absorb more carbon dioxide, Mathis told the Earth Island Journal.\nThink: pollock, Bristol Bay\u2019s famous sockeye salmon, and crab from the Bering Sea."}
