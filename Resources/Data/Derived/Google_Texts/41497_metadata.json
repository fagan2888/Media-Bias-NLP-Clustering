On the environment, Sanders proposes a national tax to cut carbon levels by 80 percent by 2050. His campaign site calls it \u201cone of the most straightforward and cost-effective strategies for quickly fighting climate change.\u201d\n\nBut in Vermont, where a proposed carbon tax is now in its second year of seeking legislative support, backers are struggling to convince the public the policy is environmentally or economically sound.\n\nThe carbon tax legislation calls for a $100 per ton of carbon emissions tax on gasoline, propane, natural gas and other fossil fuels. Proponents say a carbon tax will slash Vermont\u2019s carbon emissions by 2 million tons annually and direct tax revenue to weatherization and energy efficiency programs. Critics blast the tax as regressive, arguing it will harm Vermonters whose pocketbooks are sensitive to fluctuations in gas prices.\n\nEither way, the tax is projected to boost the cost of gasoline by up to 88 cents per gallon, assuming fuel distributors pass the cost on to consumers. A gallon of propane would rise 58 cents; heating oil and diesel fuel could jump $1.02 per gallon.\n\nWhile the tax may nudge many Vermonters to fill up vehicles in nearby states like New York and New Hampshire, there\u2019s a bigger problem: carbon-tax backers admit it won\u2019t change global CO2 levels.\n\nFaced with the prospect that Vermont\u2019s carbon tax can do little \u2014 maybe nothing \u2014 to help global warming, Paul Burns, executive director of the pro-carbon-tax Vermont Public Interest Research Group, recently said during a Montpelier debate, \u201cAlone, sure, we can\u2019t do it.\u201d\n\nPerhaps not even together. In that debate, panelists were considering the provocative findings of economist Bj\u00f8rn Lomborg, director of the Copenhagen Consensus Center. CO2 reduction initiatives in the just-wrapped 2015 Paris Climate Summit agreement, Lomborg concludes, will reduce global temperatures by only one-sixth of one degree by the end of the century.\n\nSuch policy-killing admissions occur frequently in Vermont, where the state is on track to create an all green-energy economy that runs on 90 percent renewables by 2050.\n\nAsa Hopkins, Vermont\u2019s policy chief at the Department of Public Service, spoke to Watchdog about the impact an all-green Vermont would have on global warming. His analysis was surprisingly honest, if self-defeating.\n\n\u201cClimate change is a classic tragedy-of-the-commons problem where no one person\u2019s actions, no one state, or even one country\u2019s actions is attributable to even more than maybe a few percent of the global challenge,\u201d Hopkins said.\n\nConvincing Vermonters to sacrifice money and comfort for a policy that does nothing to avert a supposed climate apocalypse looks like a losing political battle. In fact, the tax is so steep and ineffective that Vermont\u2019s Democratic governor doesn\u2019t endorse it.\n\nState lawmakers aren\u2019t biting either. Earlier this month, the chair of the House Energy Committee, Rep. Tony Klein, D-East Montpelier, told Watchdog \u201ceverybody knows that there will be no carbon tax bill seriously moved forward in any way, shape or form this session.\u201d\n\nWhen it comes to pushing a carbon tax on the nation, Sanders seems not to have gotten Vermont\u2019s memo.\n\nSanders\u2019 embrace of a single-payer health care system has fared no better in his home state.\n\nIn a rousing back-and-forth with former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton at Saturday\u2019s Democratic presidential debate, Sanders reaffirmed his belief in a Medicare-for-all single-payer health care system. That policy met crushing defeat exactly one year ago in Vermont.\n\nGov. Peter Shumlin, the top pitchman for a single-payer system in states, worked tirelessly for years to sell a government-run health care system that covered all 630,000 Vermonters. But after two years of concealing the system\u2019s financing plan under executive privilege, and after consultant \u2014 and Obamacare modeling expert \u2014 Jonathan Gruber discredited himself in a series of candid video moments, Shumlin quietly killed single-payer.\n\n\u201cAs we completed the financing modeling \u2026 it became clear that the risk of economic shock is too high at this time to offer a plan I can responsibly support for passage in the Legislature,\u201d Shumlin said at the news conference announcing the event. \u201cThe taxes required to replace health-care premiums with a publicly financed plan that would best serve Vermont are, in a word, enormous.\u201d\n\nThe new taxes required to pay for single payer were estimated at $2.6 billion for 2017, increasing to almost $3.2 billion in 2021. Estimates showed taxpayers couldn\u2019t pay for single-payer even with a massive 11.5 percent payroll tax on all businesses and a sliding-scale income tax of up to 9.5 percent.\n\nSanders\u2019 continued support of government-run health care and the carbon tax may have a simple explanation: despite their dramatic failings in Vermont, both underscore Sanders\u2019 image as a democratic socialist. Sanders founded the Congressional Progressive Caucus in the 1990s, and pushed for single-payer in Obamacare\u2019s so-called public option. Touting progressive policies out on the stump has certain appeal with voters who appreciate Sanders\u2019 do-gooder politics.\n\nBut as word leaks about the failure of progressive policies in his own backyard, Sanders may find it harder to convince national audiences they\u2019ll work for America.\n\nContact Bruce Parker at bparker@watchdog.org", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Bernie Sanders continues to endorse a carbon tax and single-payer health care despite the policies' dramatic failures in his home state of Vermont.", "title": "Bernie's favorite policies failing badly in Vermont - Watchdog.org", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2015/05/IMG_0218-1.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-12-28T10:08:55+00:00", "url": "http://watchdog.org/252671/bernie-policies-failing-in-vermont/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Watchdogorg", "section": "News", "published_time": "2015-12-28T04:00:40+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-12-28T10:08:55+00:00"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Bernie Sanders continues to endorse a carbon tax and single-payer health care despite the policies' dramatic failures in his home state of Vermont.", "title": "Bernie's favorite policies failing badly in Vermont - Watchdog.org", "image": {"src": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2015/05/IMG_0218-1.jpg"}, "creator": "@watchdogorg", "site": "@watchdogorg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive", "description": "Bernie Sanders continues to endorse a carbon tax and single-payer health care despite the policies' dramatic failures in his home state of Vermont."}, "article_summary": "The carbon tax legislation calls for a $100 per ton of carbon emissions tax on gasoline, propane, natural gas and other fossil fuels.\nProponents say a carbon tax will slash Vermont\u2019s carbon emissions by 2 million tons annually and direct tax revenue to weatherization and energy efficiency programs.\nSanders\u2019 embrace of a single-payer health care system has fared no better in his home state.\nIn a rousing back-and-forth with former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton at Saturday\u2019s Democratic presidential debate, Sanders reaffirmed his belief in a Medicare-for-all single-payer health care system.\nSanders\u2019 continued support of government-run health care and the carbon tax may have a simple explanation: despite their dramatic failings in Vermont, both underscore Sanders\u2019 image as a democratic socialist."}
