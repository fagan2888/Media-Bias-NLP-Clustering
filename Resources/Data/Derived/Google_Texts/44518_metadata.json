There were 270 attacks on aid workers last year, up from 170 the previous year; 155 aid workers were killed, 171 injured, and 134 kidnapped, according to the U.K.-based Humanitarian Outcomes. All of these numbers substantially increased:\n\nJoshua Keating Joshua Keating is a staff writer at Slate focusing on international affairs.\n\nWhile attacks were recorded in more than 30 countries, violence against aid workers is actually fairly localized phenomenon. Three-quarters of the attacks took place in just five countries: Afghanistan, Syria, South Sudan, Pakistan, and Sudan. These are, not surprisingly, all locations \u201cexperiencing armed insurgencies and/or failures of governance and rule of law.\u201d The report argues that the numbers do \u201cnot reflect a growing worldwide trend of targeting aid workers, but is mostly limited to this small number of cases where conflict has broken out.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nJust because a country isn\u2019t on that list doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s safe for aid workers. Somalia, for instance, saw a reduction last year mainly because agencies reduced their presence there. Medecins Sans Frontieres, for instance, pulled out entirely in 2013, after 22 years of operating in the country, because of attacks on its staff.\n\nAbout 43 percent of the attacks targeted national NGOs rather than international or U.N. organizations. Overall, workers seem to be most vulnerable when traveling. More than half of the incidents were roadside ambushes or attacks.\n\nThis year is certainly shaping up to be another grim one in the countries noted above. The U.N. reported earlier this month that five aid workers had been killed by a militia group in South Sudan. Afghanistan has seen a number of attacks on aid workers as well.", "article_metadata": {"fb-share": "Record Number of Aid Workers Killed Around the World Last Year", "sailthru.author": "Joshua Keating", "description": "2013 was the deadliest year on record for aid workers, according to a new report from a humanitarian consulting group.
