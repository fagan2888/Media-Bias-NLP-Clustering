The women are seeking damages for lost income, medical costs and, in some cases, the cost of raising their children.\n\nA spokeswoman at Endo's U.S. headquarters in Malvern did not immediately return a message Thursday seeking comment.\n\nThe lawsuit filed last week in Philadelphia came days after a federal judge in Georgia refused to grant class-action certification to a similar suit filed there.\n\nU.S. District Judge Steve C. Jones noted in his ruling that only 53 of the half-million recalled blister packs had the pills arranged in reverse order in the package. He said that each woman's case was unique \u2014 given whether she became pregnant, whether she carried the pregnancy to term, the relevant laws in her state, and whether she kept the package or receipt \u2014 and should be weighed individually.\n\n\"It is not enough that each class member prove that defendants sold a defective product,\" Jones wrote. \"Each plaintiff must show in an individualized manner which 'physical symptoms' she suffered, her medical history, and whether her use of any allegedly defective product resulted in these physical symptoms or a pregnancy.\"\n\nThe recall involved the brand names Cyclafem, Emoquette, Gildess, Orsythia, Previfem and Tri-Previfem.\n\nEach packet of birth control contains 28 days' worth of pills, with 21 containing hormones that prevent pregnancy and seven placebos pills. Women are supposed to take the pills in order and not mix the placebos with the active pills. The pills are normally color-coded to note the difference.\n\nLaws in some states allow women to sue over the cost of raising a child to age 18, according to lawyer Keith Bodoh of Marietta, Georgia, who filed the Philadelphia lawsuit. Damages in a few states could include the cost of college. But the formula in four states involves the cost of raising a child minus the presumed benefits.\n\n\"It's amorphous, what to decide (is) the cost and benefit of rearing a child,\" Bodoh said this week.\n\nThe Philadelphia Inquirer first reported on the lawsuit in a story Tuesday.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Lawsuit: Birth control mix-up results in 113 pregnancies - AP News: PHILADELPHIA (AP) \u2014 More than 100 women who blame their .05/27/2016 7:50:52AM EST.", "author": "AP News", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "PHILADELPHIA (AP) \u2014 More than 100 women who blame their pregnancies on errant birth control", "title": "AP News - Lawsuit: Birth control mix-up results in 113 pregnancies", "url": "http://townhall.com/news/us/2015/11/12/lawsuit-birth-control-mixup-results-in-113-pregnancies-n2079983", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/_townhall/resources/images/thog.png", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "PHILADELPHIA (AP) \u2014 More than 100 women who blame their pregnancies on errant birth control", "title": "AP News - Lawsuit: Birth control mix-up results in 113 pregnancies", "url": "http://townhall.com/news/us/2015/11/12/lawsuit-birth-control-mixup-results-in-113-pregnancies-n2079983", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/_townhall/resources/images/thog.png", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Lawsuit: Birth control mix-up results in 113 pregnancies, AP News, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "PHILADELPHIA (AP) \u2014 More than 100 women who blame their pregnancies on errant birth control packaging have joined a negligence lawsuit filed in Philadelphia against several drug companies.\nAll but four of the 117 women involved in the lawsuit became pregnant and 94 went on to give birth.\nThe lawsuit filed last week in Philadelphia came days after a federal judge in Georgia refused to grant class-action certification to a similar suit filed there.\nEach packet of birth control contains 28 days' worth of pills, with 21 containing hormones that prevent pregnancy and seven placebos pills.\nThe women are seeking damages for lost income, medical costs and, in some cases, the cost of raising their children."}
