Other plans \u2014 for-profit as well as not-for-profit \u2014 have struggled to make money on many exchanges.\n\nUnitedHealth initially chose not to participate in California\u2019s health insurance exchange but asked to be included next year.\n\n\u201cPart of the reason they wanted to be in California was we have a large and stable risk pool,\u201d said Peter Lee, executive director of Covered California. \u201cNone of our plans lost money in California,\u201d Lee said.\n\nLee said \u201csenior people\u201d at UnitedHealth assured him the company is \u201cabsolutely committed to California next year.\u201d\n\nHowever, he said that \u201call bets are off for everybody in 2017,\u201d adding, \u201cWe have not decided which plans we will include for that year, and we are going to be raising the bar substantially relative to our quality expectations. We told UnitedHealth that, and they\u2019re still very interested. We have no reason to believe United won\u2019t be in the mix.\u201d\n\nUnitedHealth asked earlier this year to sell exchange policies throughout the state, but Covered California limited the company\u2019s participating to only a few of the exchange\u2019s 19 selling regions.\n\nYesterday\u2019s announcement is something of a change in direction for UnitedHealth, which last month predicted participation in ACA exchanges would bring growth and prosperity for shareholders.\n\nUnitedHealth got a slow start in the ACA, selling in four exchanges initially. It grew to 23 exchanges last year \u2014 covering about 550,000 people through exchanges \u2014 and is slated to be in 34 exchanges next year.", "article_metadata": {"description": "<p>UnitedHealth Group announced yesterday it's losing too much money in Affordable Care Act's health insurance exchanges and may reduce participation next year.
