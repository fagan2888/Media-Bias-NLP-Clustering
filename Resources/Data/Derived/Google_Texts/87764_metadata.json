Murphy, the first Iraq War veteran in Congress, is currently a Fellow at the Institute of Politics. He sat down with The Maroon to discuss ROTC, midterm elections, and how to encourage constructive dialogue and compromise.\n\nChicago Maroon (CM): What motivated you to join ROTC and the Army?\n\nPatrick Murphy (PM): You know it\u2019s one of those things where my roommate took a military science class, an Army ROTC military science class\u2026. And I fell in love with the military and that form of public service. In my opinion, in both politics and outside of it, it\u2019s probably the most pure form of public service. And it was great to feel like I made a difference in people\u2019s lives. Whether it was deploying to Bosnia, where we stopped a war; or ethnic cleansing of Muslims\u2014worst ethnic cleansing in Europe since World War II\u2014or whether it was serving in Iraq and visiting the orphanages in south central Baghdad. It was a pretty heady experience.\n\nCM: Why should UChicago reinstate ROTC?\n\nPM: This is an elite institution, and other elite institutions like Harvard and Yale have embraced ROTC especially since the repeal of Don\u2019t Ask, Don\u2019t Tell has gone into effect. And I was proud that that was the bill that I authored when I was in the U.S. Congress. So I think that it\u2019s a no-brainer to give the opportunity for the thousands of students here who want to get into public service to look at that as a potential avenue to go into.\n\nCM: Some people say that reinstating ROTC would be supporting U.S. military imperialism and the atrocities committed in Iraq and Afghanistan. What would you say to that?\n\nPM: I would tell those people to look at my record. I think those who have served in combat are those who are least likely to send our young men and women into harm\u2019s way. Especially unnecessarily. As was the case in Iraq.\n\nCM: So you think it encourages people to understand better what war means?\n\nPM: When you look at the history of the strongest advocates for the limitation of military power\u2014people like President Eisenhower, who talked about the military-industrial complex. Young presidents like John F. Kennedy, who was a World War II combat veteran, who if it wasn\u2019t for him we would have went to war over the Cuban Missile Crisis. Those who have seen the horrors of combat and war are those who are most likely to be hesitant and to follow the American tradition of the United States as a reluctant warrior.\n\nCM: After you left the military, what made you interested in running for office?\n\nPM: I lost 19 men in my unit in Iraq and thought it was an unnecessary war. So I came back home to Pennsylvania and ran against an incumbent congressman and won a race that most political prognosticators said I never had a chance. But I became the second Democrat to win in over 100 years in Bucks County, Pennsylvania. And then won re-election and proudly served.\n\nCM: Were you thinking about what effect it would have at all on ROTC on campus when you were pushing that bill? Because a lot of the reasons that colleges were saying they didn\u2019t want ROTC was because of Don\u2019t Ask, Don\u2019t Tell.\n\nPM: What campuses across the nation don\u2019t understand is the military executes the laws. And when I was a young college professor at West Point as an Army captain, going to campuses like Columbia and others and have them protest my presence, after 9/11, was pretty disturbing. Especially when I was teaching the next generation of military leaders at West Point how wrong the policy was. So to go and confront some of those protestors and let them know I thought they were absolutely right, that the policy is wrong, but it\u2019s the Congress that was responsible for it, not the military. The military just executes the laws and orders given to them.\n\nCM: So you think some of that focus that people place on the military should rather be placed on political leaders?\n\nPM: It should be solely placed on political leaders in Washington and elsewhere.\n\nCM: Switching subjects a little, Democrats recently got beat down in the midterm elections. There are a lot of reasons for this, but what do you think are some of the main reasons?\n\nPM: Leadership is inspiring others to do things that they wouldn\u2019t necessarily do. And if you\u2019re running for office as a Democrat, you have to convince people that you\u2019re fighting for the little guy. That\u2019s the foundation and the bedrock of the Democratic party. And [when] we\u2019re not willing to stand up to fight against tens of trillions of dollars, I should say trillions of dollars in student-loan debt, [it] burdens our generation of students. Or being wanting to do what\u2019s necessary to bring jobs back, good paying jobs and family-sustainable jobs here in America. You can\u2019t cater to special interests solely. And I think the Democrat Party lost its way a little bit, and it showed in the election results.\n\nCM: Are you saying that the Democrats didn\u2019t have a strong enough backbone?\n\nPM: Well, I think the evidence that not one person went to jail for one of the worst financial crises in American history\u2014that cost the taxpayer $900 billion to bail them out, and not one person went to jail\u2014is a pretty sad indictment on our government.\n\nCM: Along these lines, Jon Stewart recently called Democrats \u201cchickenshits.\u201d Stewart made the point that when you have candidates who won\u2019t even say they voted for the president of their party\u2026\n\nPM: I agree with Jon Stewart that too many Democrats are chickenshit. My dad used to tell me if you don\u2019t stand for something, you\u2019ll fall for anything. So you damn better well stand for something.\n\nCM: Do you agree with the idea that Democrats were too scared to run on the record of what they had accomplished under Obama?\n\nPM: You look at the sheer numbers of the millions of jobs created under President Obama, in his term, and the efforts, both ending the war in Iraq and drawing it down in Afghanistan, or domestic policy where the unemployment rate is now under 6%. Or even for middle class families who rely on the 401K plans for their pensions. The stock market went from 6,500 to 17,000. These are historic gains that will help the middle class. But if you don\u2019t tell the American people what you\u2019ve done for them, then they\u2019re not going to know about it. So you better damn well be proud of what you fought so hard for.\n\nCM: So you don\u2019t regret your votes on health care reform and cap-and-trade?\n\nPM: I don\u2019t regret doing what\u2019s necessary to wean ourselves off of our dependence on foreign oil. Fighting for local initiatives like the fifth-largest solar field in America, is in Bucks County. But when you lose 19 men in Iraq and you know in your heart of hearts that one of the reasons why we\u2019re there is because of our dependence on foreign oil\u2026if you don\u2019t come back and fight for a change, I don\u2019t know what else you should fight for.\n\nCM: This is the second midterm in a row where Democrats have been beaten down pretty hard. So isn\u2019t this proof that voters just support Republican policies more than Democratic policies?\n\nPM: I would say Democrats traditionally vote every four years, to their own detriment. And you have to motivate and inspire people to get off their asses and go to the polls on Election Day across the nation. And it\u2019s not just about why the other guy should be fired, but it should be why you should be hired. And you should be hired because you have a consistent message that proves to the American people that you\u2019re fighting for the little guy. And that\u2019s what the tradition of the Democratic Party is and not fighting for big business or special interests.\n\nCM: How can we end the gridlock currently paralyzing Congress? Is there any way to end it?\n\nPM: Well, the Republicans have no more excuses. They have to now govern. They control the House and the Senate. They can only blame the President so much. So I\u2019m looking forward to seeing some tangible results come out of Washington\u2014some of which won\u2019t be the perfect bill, but things that are necessary to move our country forward and get people working again.\n\nCM: Are you hopeful that we\u2019ll see some agreements between President Obama and the congressional Republicans?\n\nPM: I think we\u2019ll see legislation to make the Affordable Health Care Act even better, whether that\u2019s the medical device tax and other measures. But also things like an infrastructure bill, which is desperately needed. And I\u2019m hopeful that the Republicans look at the map in 2016 and know that to pass immigration reform if they want any shot at winning the White House again.\n\nCM: But do you think they will pass immigration reform?\n\nPM: I\u2019m not that hopeful that Republicans will. I think they\u2019ll cater more to the Ted Cruz wing of their party than what moderate Republicans and the Chamber of Commerce are generally for, which is immigration reform.\n\nCM: There\u2019s been a controversy recently at UChicago about the dichotomy of free speech and making sure you have a diverse and inclusive campus that isn\u2019t one that\u2019s welcoming to hate speech. What are your thoughts on this? Should free speech be restricted to protect people from hate speech and racism?\n\nPM: I think you go back to the first amendment rights. All speech is protected, except FIDO. Fighting words, incitement to riot, defamation of character, or obscenities. And as long as it doesn\u2019t meet the FIDO criteria, it should be welcome on every campus in America.\n\nCM: Racial slurs, for example, would that be in FIDO?\n\nPM: If you have racially insensitive remarks, I think that that would be considered fighting words to a lot of Americans, including myself.\n\nCM: Why should people care about politics and get involved when nothing ever happens and the goal of most politicians seems to be only political point scoring?\n\nPM: Because the great thing about political public service is you can make a major difference in people\u2019s lives. But when I helped raise the minimum wage back in 2007, it was the first raise in 10 years for most Americans\u2014for a lot of Americans. And you have to show people why these policies are so important. And the fact that millions of Americans have health insurance and they now won\u2019t die is something I\u2019m proud of\u2026. But we got to make it better, and we got to make sure that we don\u2019t go into unnecessary wars, whether that\u2019s in Syria, the Ukraine, or Iraq.\n\nCM: But a lot of what you\u2019re talking about was done with Democratic control of the House, Senate, and presidency. And that is something that is very rare.\n\nPM: I disagree with you. We passed the minimum-wage bill when President Bush was in office. And I think if the Republicans find their voice in that, they know that they have to represent all Americans and not just the powerful few on Wall Street, that they\u2019ll see that they have to come back towards the middle. And I\u2019m hopeful as an American that that\u2019s what they\u2019ll see. And they\u2019ll start ignoring the Ted Cruz wing of their own party.\n\nCM: It seems like people aren\u2019t able to disagree without being disagreeable. How can we allow ourselves to have these conversations without getting into these extreme shouting matches where we just refuse to listen?\n\nPM: I think it\u2019s important to remind folks that when we see people who are coming together to move the ball forward, even if bills aren\u2019t perfect, you\u2019re not compromising your principles, and you\u2019re doing your job and your duty to this nation. And I think far too often that people on the far left and the far right want to highlight those most extreme amongst us. And it\u2019s to the detriment of our nation.\n\nCM: So how can we stop this from happening?\n\nPM: I think you start in your daily life. So if someone comments in a class with, [it] could be a political viewpoint that contrasts directly with your point of view, that you don\u2019t attack them as a person. That you try to listen and remember that God gave everyone two ears but only one mouth for a reason.\n\nCM: What is your advice to people who are interested in public service?\n\nPM: They should get engaged in every way possible. Whether that\u2019s joining a campaign or running themselves. When I ran for Congress I was 31 years old and I had $322 in my bank account, and I beat Rick Santorum\u2019s prot\u00e9g\u00e9 by 0.6 percent a year and a half later. Most folks told me not to do it and I had no chance, but I was doing it for the 19 men I served with who never made it home from Iraq. And when I get to Congress we really made a difference in our short time there.\n\nThis interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Chicago Maroon", "description": "\u201cI lost 19 men in my unit in Iraq....
