It can generally take more than a month to get an appointment with a dermatologist. Kaiser Permanente is using telemedicine to screen patients and figure out which ones need to see a specialist.\n\nBrenda Keagy has a history of skin cancer, so when she spotted something that looked suspicious recently, she wanted to see her dermatologist.\n\nIt would have taken more than a month to get an appointment, so she emailed him.\n\n\u201cAnd he emailed back and asked me if I could send a photograph of the item and attach it to the email system through Kaiser.org,\" Keagy recalled. \"So I did that, and he was able to respond back to me with what the next step was.\u201d\n\nIt turned out that Keagy\u2019s skin lesion was cancerous. So her dermatologist had her come into the office so he could remove it.\n\nBut after a few days, Keagy was worried that it wasn\u2019t healing properly.\n\n\u201cSo, I sent him a photograph of the spot, he looked at it, I had to explain to him in the email what I was experiencing,\" she said. \"He told me it was quite normal, it was healing just perfectly, and if I had any concerns after another week or two to let him know.\u201d\n\nTeledermatology was introduced about 20 years ago. It was originally designed as a way to provide dermatology screenings for people who lived in rural areas, far away from specialists.\n\nToday, it\u2019s used in both urban and rural settings.\n\nKaiser has the nation\u2019s most robust program.\n\nPrimary care doctors initiate the vast majority of Kaiser\u2019s teledermatology services.\n\nWhen doctors find a questionable skin problem, they have one of their staff take pictures of it.\n\nThe photos are sent directly to a dermatologist.\n\nPrimary care doctor Martin Bartolac said it\u2019s a very useful tool.\n\n\u201cEven though it takes a little bit more time for us to do it, we get almost immediate feedback to our patients with a question,\" he explained. \"Our patients love it. They think it\u2019s a great service, and we don\u2019t disagree. We think it is a great service for our physicians because we learn quite a lot, every time this happens, as well.\u201d\n\nAbout 800 Kaiser patients in San Diego use the service each month.\n\nKaiser dermatologists screen the photos as part of their daily routine. The photos are attached to a patient\u2019s medical record.\n\nDr. Jeffrey Benabio looks at one image, that shows a patch of skin that looks like it came from a brown snake.\n\n\u201cSo this is the kind of thing where I would actually write back to the primary care physician and say that, unfortunately, is a melanoma skin cancer,\" he explained, \"and what we need to do is to have that patient to come in to see us right away, so we can do surgery to remove it.\u201d\n\nIn other cases, Dr. Benabio may spot something that looks serious, but is just a common rash.\n\n\n\nHe said teledermatology allows him to spend the majority of his time on patients who need to be seen in person.\n\n\u201cThose patients who didn\u2019t actually need to come in, who are quite satisfied with just getting their problem fixed, that saves me a visit, so that I\u2019m allowed and able to do these other things, where really, I\u2019m much more valuable,\" Benabio explained. \"It\u2019s much more important that I do that.\u201d\n\nBut not all dermatologists are convinced that teledermatology is ready for prime time.\n\nUC San Diego\u2019s Dr. Casey Carlos said primary care doctors don\u2019t always take a picture of the worst lesion on patients.\n\n\u201cAnd so they did a study at the VA, where basically they took a photo of what that primary care physician was worried about, and less than half of the time was that the most worrisome thing on the patient\u2019s body,\" Carlos said. \"So, once they were actually sent in, and evaluated by dermatologists, they found melanomas, or sequim-cell carcinomas, and other places that may not have been identified as that worrisome lesion that they took the picture of.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s more, Carlos said taking pictures of isolated lesions or moles just can\u2019t compare to an in-person, full-body exam.\n\n\u201cA good dermatologist should be looking through your hair, looking in your genitalia area, looking in private areas, looking between your toes, in areas that I think it would be really hard to get a good image, with either a camera, or even a video camera at this point,\u201d she said.\n\nStudies comparing teledermatology with in-person visits come down on both sides of the fence.\n\nSome show teledermatology is just as accurate as face-to-face appointments, while other research finds just the opposite.\n\nDr. Benabio maintains teledermatology is an effective way to screen and diagnose patients. And he said at Kaiser, they take steps to make sure they get it right.\n\nFor example, Benabio said for most health problems, only one doctor sees a patient.\n\n\u201cBut in telederm, here in San Diego, when you send a photo, actually every photo for which we don\u2019t actually see the patient, a second dermatologist reviews it, because it\u2019s so quick,\" he said. \"So it\u2019s a quality assurance that\u2019s built in, and so that\u2019s fantastic, because we\u2019re in some ways higher quality than you would be if you were doing it in person.\u201d\n\nAs more Americans get healthcare through the Affordable Care Act, the demand for dermatologists will likely go up.\n\nTeledermatology is one way to broaden access. At the very least, it could save patients a lot of wait time.", "article_metadata": {"description": "It can generally take more than a month to get an appointment with a dermatologist.
