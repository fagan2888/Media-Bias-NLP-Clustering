(Sorry.)\n\nThough British researchers established people in their 70s and 80s frequently have sex, little is known about the ways in which cognitive function influences a senior\u2019s perception of sex: Is it important? Is it pleasant? Researchers from Manchester University aimed to learn more by analyzing data collected from nearly 2,000 adults (an average age of 71) who participated in the 2005-6 cycle of the Longitudinal Aging Study Amsterdam.\n\nParticipants answered questions having to do with sexuality and intimacy, such as the importance of sexuality, the status of their sex life, and their personal need for intimacy. Participants then completed tests on their general cognitive functioning, memory performance, processing speed, and fluid intelligence.\n\nWhen it came to having a sex life, a quarter of adults said it was important or very important, while 41 percent rated it was unimportant. What\u2019s more is 32 percent of participants said sex in old age was pleasant compared to six percent who said it wasn\u2019t. As for intimacy, 67 percent of adults believed touching and intimacy were necessary in old age; 12 percent did not.\n\nInterestingly, lower fluid intelligence \u2014 the capacity for abstract thinking and quick reasoning \u2014 was associated with the idea an active, pleasant sex life was not important in old age, as was lower cognitive functioning. Overall, adults who didn\u2019t believe sex or intimacy was important in old age performed worse on cognitive function tests compared to those who found it very important. These results suggest not only can senior adults have vibrant sex lives, but they should.\n\nAccording to the American Psychological Association, we don\u2019t discuss the importance of sexuality among senior adults enough. And according to the Hartford Institute of Geriatric Nursing, seniors with an active sex life helps men and women fulfill otherwise social, emotion, and psychological components of life; \u201cit evokes sentiments of joy, romance, affection, passion, and intimacy.\u201d\n\nStudies such as this help make it easier for senior men and women to reevaluate their sex life, to learn sexual health is as important now as it was in their 20s. Additionally, these studies are learning opportunities for health care providers. Understanding sexual activity, behaviors, and problems can prompt helpful discussions in the doctor\u2019s office.\n\nSource: Hartmans C, Comijs H, and Jonker C.
