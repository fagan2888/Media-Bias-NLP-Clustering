In April, the Jeffco Board of Commissioners appointed a task force to study the issue. This week, the commission will hear the results of its reports, excerpted below.\n\nThe question isn\u2019t whether marijuana will be sold and consumed in Jefferson County. That is happening and will continue.\n\nThe question is whether Jefferson County will start taking real steps to shut down the black market and begin to reap the benefits of legal marijuana sales.\n\nMarijuana has been bought and sold in Jefferson County for decades; it\u2019s just happened in the shadows. It\u2019s been sold by people who don\u2019t care who they sell to, and who have no stake in anything other than making the next sale. They don\u2019t care if they sell to your kid or the person next door. Everyone\u2019s a potential customer.\n\nThe sad fact is that after 45 years of the war on marijuana, it remains universally available.\n\nJefferson County now has the opportunity to start strangling the black market and to replace it with a responsible, strictly regulated and controlled industry. The people want this: Marijuana legalization passed with 54 percent support of Jefferson County voters.\n\nJefferson County faces the following choice: Choose a model similar to alcohol that embraces licensing, regulation, transparency, accountability, and taxation; or stick with the current model where the sale of marijuana is dominated by organized crime, similar to Al Capone\u2019s criminal enterprise, and illegal home-grows operate unencumbered throughout Jefferson County neighborhoods.\n\nBy allowing licensed marijuana businesses, Jefferson County will improve the economy, create hundreds of jobs, collect millions in new tax revenue, boost real estate and construction, and eliminate many problems caused by black market operators.\n\nThe doom and gloom predictions of opponents didn\u2019t come to pass. In fact, it\u2019s been just the opposite.\n\n\u2022 Crime: Denver\u2019s violent crime rate has decreased substantially post legalization. In the last year, homicides are down 32 percent and sexual assaults are down 14.7 percent. Traffic fatalities are near record lows in Colorado. Data from the Colorado Department of Transportation shows fatalities plummeted from 743 in 2002 to 481 in 2013.\n\n\u2022 Teen use: Since legalization, teen marijuana use in Colorado has dropped from 22 percent in 2011 to 20 percent in 2013, according to the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment. Teen use also decreased from 24.8 percent in 2009 to 22 percent in 2011, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. These decreases happened at the same time that Colorado licensed and regulated over 500 marijuana businesses and legalized marijuana for those 21 and up.\n\nColorado\u2019s teen marijuana use rate is currently 3.4 percent below the national average of 23.4 percent.\n\n\u2022 The economy: Numerous studies show marijuana reform has been a major benefit to Colorado. Colorado has the fastest-growing economy in the nation, according to Business Insider.\n\n\u2022 Tourism: The state of Colorado, the city of Denver, and the Colorado ski industry are all reporting record tourism. Colorado is also experiencing record construction and real estate.\n\n\u2022 Jobs: According to the Colorado Department of Revenue, there are well over 10,000 jobs in the marijuana industry \u2014 and that doesn\u2019t include thousands of additional jobs for construction workers, electricians, architects, accountants, security, real estate, legal, law enforcement, and more.\n\n\u2022 Public health: A new study shows that legal access to marijuana is associated with fewer prescription drug overdose deaths. Another recent study shows that couples that smoke marijuana are less likely to engage in domestic violence.\n\nBy banning licensed, regulated and taxed marijuana businesses, Jefferson County residents would continue to buy from black market operators, or simply purchase marijuana from legal marijuana businesses in neighboring localities. Under this model, Jefferson County will have increased costs trying to fight an uncontrollable black market, but will be transferring the economic benefits and revenue to neighboring localities that opt in.\n\nBy opting in, Jefferson County will be following the will of its voters, and will take this unique opportunity to squeeze out the black market, improve the economy, create jobs, enhance revenue, and increase the basic civil liberties of its citizens.\n\nMichael Elliott is an attorney and the executive director of the Marijuana Industry Group, a trade association of licensed marijuana businesses based in Denver.\n\nOther members of the Jefferson County Marijuana Task Force signing on to this report were Brian Richardson, an independent insurance agency owner; Erin Phillips, owner of Strainwise, Inc.; and attorney Jordan Wellington.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Should Jeffco allow retail marijuana stores in unincorporated parts of the county?
