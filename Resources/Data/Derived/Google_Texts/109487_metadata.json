It also specifies that the Secretary \"shall\" order a referendum if it appears likely that a majority of those voting would seek to form part of a united Ireland.\n\nA BBC/RTE survey in November found that just 30 percent of voters in Northern Ireland would like to see a united Ireland in their lifetime.\n\nMany in Northern Ireland fear that new border restrictions resulting from a \"Brexit\" could re-energize nationalist demands for a unification which helped fuel three decades of violence with the British authorities and unionists who want to remain part of Britain. At least 3,600 people were killed in the \"The Troubles\".\n\nNorthern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party, the province's largest party that shares power with Sinn Fein, is campaigning for Britain to leave the EU.\n\n(Reporting by Padraic Halpin in Dublin)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "A so-called \"Brexit\" would represent a \"political and economic game changer\" for the i", "title": "North Ireland deputy leader calls for unity vote if Britain leaves EU", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/03/11/North-Ireland-deputy-leader-calls-unity-vote-if-Britain-leaves-EU", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/ireland-election_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/03/11/North-Ireland-deputy-leader-calls-unity-vote-if-Britain-leaves-EU", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/ireland-election_1.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "A so-called \"Brexit\" would represent a \"political and economic game changer\" for the i", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "A BBC/RTE survey in November found that just 30 percent of voters in Northern Ireland would like to see a united Ireland in their lifetime.\nBritain's Secretary of State to Northern Ireland may call a border poll at any time, according to the 1998 agreement that brought about peace.\nNorthern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party, the province's largest party that shares power with Sinn Fein, is campaigning for Britain to leave the EU.\nIt also specifies that the Secretary \"shall\" order a referendum if it appears likely that a majority of those voting would seek to form part of a united Ireland.\nA so-called \"Brexit\" would represent a \"political and economic game changer\" for the island of Ireland, Martin McGuinness of the Sinn Fein party said, calling for an immediate border poll if Britain voted to leave."}
