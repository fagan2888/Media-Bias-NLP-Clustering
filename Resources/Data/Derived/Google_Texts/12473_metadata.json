Then I walk through a land of dreams. It\u2019s a manmade land with natural things full of highly ornamented rooms, divine creatures, intricate rituals, inspiring inscriptions, and gorgeous nymphs who bring me the essences of songs, lyrics, and stories. Then I weave fragrances which sing these songs and tell these stories in a made-up language unique to each person.\n\nTo make this happen, I primarily blend and wear pure perfume oils, however over the last few months, I\u2019ve been experimenting more and more with eau de parfum, which basically has a higher alcohol content. The ingredients are all the same, but there is a difference in the alcohol to perfume content ratio, which by the way, is still natural, I only use food-based, organic spirits and natural botanic oils. And, of course, the experience of applying and wearing the perfumes is different.\n\nPure perfume oils are concentrated; they\u2019re a dense experience; the application is more direct. With eau de parfum on the other hand, you incorporate an atomizer. And I love atomizers! They disperse the scent in a different way, creating a new experience. It\u2019s still very long lasting and beautiful, but different. I wouldn\u2019t diminish one or the other. They\u2019re just unique experiences. You could say, there\u2019s a magic to an atomizer and an elegance to a perfume oil. They\u2019re both right for different moods and occasions.\n\nWhere do you mine inspiration?\n\nFrom the fairies that live in the forest, especially the ones who inhabit the hills of the Pacific coastline. Recently, I\u2019ve also been incredibly inspired by my collaboration with folk singer-songwriter Father John Misty.\n\nHow would you describe your work?\n\nAs a mysterious inscription that tells the story of memory theater through the sense of scent.\n\nWhat are you most inquisitive about?\n\nI\u2019m most inquisitive about the language of scents, and the effects of that language once it envelopes you. I\u2019m also most inquisitive late at night and early in the morning.\n\nWhat drives your curiosity?\n\nA desire to share interpretations with people. Communication beyond words and thoughts.\n\nHow do you keep things curious?\n\nCuriosity can happen at any moment, like a breeze though your hair or wind felling trees, like wafting moments of sidewalk rosemary, surprising notes of night-blooming jasmine, or spotting a star at the same instance I smell an orange blossom nearby.", "article_metadata": {"description": "LA-based perfumer Sanae Barber is a modern-day alchemist who brings a distinct sensibility to the world of scents", "title": "The Perfumer: Sanae Barber", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "LA-based perfumer Sanae Barber is a modern-day alchemist who brings a distinct sensibility to the world of scents", "title": "The Perfumer: Sanae Barber", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2013/09/17/the_perfumer_sanae_barber/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/09/Sanea_BW.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "LA-based perfumer Sanae Barber is a modern-day alchemist who brings a distinct sensibility to the world of scents", "title": "The Perfumer: Sanae Barber", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/09/Sanea_BW.png", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Sponsored by Hendrick's Gin", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, beauty, Hendrick's Gin, HENDRICKS_STORYPROMO, Keepers of Curiosity, SANAE BARBER, style", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9e0b\"", "article_summary": "Pure perfume oils are concentrated; they\u2019re a dense experience; the application is more direct.\nThey disperse the scent in a different way, creating a new experience.\nTo make this happen, I primarily blend and wear pure perfume oils, however over the last few months, I\u2019ve been experimenting more and more with eau de parfum, which basically has a higher alcohol content.\nI\u2019m most inquisitive about the language of scents, and the effects of that language once it envelopes you.\nTopics: beauty, Hendrick's Gin, HENDRICKS_STORYPROMO, Keepers of Curiosity, SANAE BARBER, styleThis is the fourth installment in a new series called Keepers of Curiosity, featuring interviews with intrepid performers, artists, writers and culinary-minded individuals with a thirst for discovery and innovation."}
