Fox News corrects Obamacare chart\n\nFox News on Tuesday corrected a misleading graphic of the number of enrollees in the Affordable Care Act exchanges originally aired in a broadcast on Monday.\n\nThe original graphic had the correct number of enrollees, about 6 million as of March 27, but placed the number in a bar graph that looked to be approximately one-third the size of the slightly more than 7 million enrollee goal for March 31.\n\nOn Tuesday morning, America's Newsroom host Bill Hemmer noted the mistake and showed a corrected graphic.\n\n\"Programming note, yesterday around this time you might have seen a graphic on the Obamacare signup numbers. Here is what that graphic should have looked like: On the left it shows the six million signups reported for the administration as of March 27, compared to the target number of 7 million plus. That was our mistake, correction noted,\" Hemmer said.\n\nOn Tuesday afternoon the White House announced a total of 7,041,000 people had signed up for healthcare on the new exchanges, a number that does not include enrollment surges that took place in the 14 states running their own insurance marketplaces.\n\nHadas Gold is a reporter at Politico.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "<p>The network apologizes for showing a misleading graphic of health care enrollment numbers.&nbsp;</p>", "title": "Fox News corrects Obamacare chart", "url": "http://www.politico.com/blogs/media/2014/04/fox-news-corrects-obamcare-chart-186120.html", "image": "http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201404/1867/1155968404_3419224630001_vs-533b1be6e4b03bdc02f8f757-672293882001.jpg?pubId=1155968404", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/hadas.gold"}, "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "<p>The network apologizes for showing a misleading graphic of health care enrollment numbers.&nbsp;</p>", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb4ed\"", "article_summary": "On Media Blog Archives Select Date\u2026 December, 2015 November, 2015 October, 2015 September, 2015 August, 2015 July, 2015 June, 2015 May, 2015 April, 2015 March, 2015 February, 2015 January, 2015Fox New corrects an Obamacare enrollment chart Tuesday.\nFox News corrects Obamacare chartFox News on Tuesday corrected a misleading graphic of the number of enrollees in the Affordable Care Act exchanges originally aired in a broadcast on Monday.\nOn Tuesday morning, America's Newsroom host Bill Hemmer noted the mistake and showed a corrected graphic.\n\"Programming note, yesterday around this time you might have seen a graphic on the Obamacare signup numbers.\nThat was our mistake, correction noted,\" Hemmer said."}
