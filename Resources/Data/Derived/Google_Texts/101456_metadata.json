The GED test has changed, and it's hard. ...

(Shelley Wildhalm/ Reporter-Herald)\n\nThe two-hour ceremony was held for the first time in the center's new home, the House of Neighborly Service Life Center, which currently houses 14 nonprofits in one building. The Center for Adult Learning in Loveland offers classes in GED, English as a Second Language, basic academic skills, college preparation, career development and computer literacy.\n\n\"We want the families and friends of students to actually be able to see our new digs,\" said Sondra Merk, program coordinator at the center, referring to the school's location on the second floor in four classrooms on the east end of the building. \"We love having classes here because we have the space to actually spread out in class and do projects and teamwork kinds of things.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMerk welcomed the graduates and their friends and families who gathered on the first floor of the building in a makeshift auditorium between the lobby and an unfinished area that eventually will house tenant spaces and a coffee shop.\n\nStaff presented the students participating in the Center for Adult Learning in Loveland programs \u2014 there currently are 334 students ages 17 to 74 \u2014 with certificates recognizing their work.\n\nThe staff members gave special attention to the students in the English as a Second Language program by inviting them on stage for a Parade of Nations, where they introduced themselves in their own languages and translated what they said into English. A few of the flags representing their countries \u2014 they come from 24 countries and speak 19 languages \u2014 hung from the balcony.\n\n\"We just want to show the audience that we have people from all over the world,\" Merk said.\n\nThe ceremony ended with the graduates, who were the first to take a tougher GED exam. Typically, the Center for Adult Learning in Loveland graduates 65 students, but this time there were fewer because of the new exam and the center's move, Merk said.\n\nJodi Mullen, deputy district attorney of the 6th Judicial District and a former member of the center's staff, spoke to the graduates about her struggles to get a GED and stick with school until she earned her law degree. She advised them to believe in themselves because they are stronger, smarter and more capable than they think.\n\n\"What you're doing matters,\" Mullen said. \"Learning is the greatest achievement you can have, and don't forget to enjoy the ride.\"\n\nTaylor Baldwin, one of the four graduates at the ceremony, gave the graduation speech.\n\n\"At one point in my life, I never thought I could achieve this goal,\" said Taylor, 17, of Loveland, thanking her family. \"They've pushed me through all of this and (wanted) me to give my all.\"\n\nBaldwin, who dropped out of school at age 15, plans to go to college to study nursing, she said.\n\n\"I'm so thankful to everyone who supported me because this is my biggest life goal,\" Baldwin said.\n\nAfter the ceremony, graduate Christopher Cameron said school was hard for him and that he dropped out at age 17. He took three to four months to earn his GED at age 21, he said.\n\n\"It's good to finally have something accomplished,\" Cameron said. \"It's the first time I saw something through. ... This place changed my life. It's given me more confidence in myself, and it allowed me to move forward in my life.\"\n\nShelley Widhalm: 970-669-5050, swidhalm@reporter-herald.com, twitter.com/ShelleyWidhalm", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.reporterherald.com/news/education/ci_28132755/graduates-accomplish-amazing-feat", "modificationDate": "2015-05-17T19:57:11-0600", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site47/2015/0516/20150516__17RHAGRADUATION~1_300.jpg", "sailthru.author": "By Shelley Widhalm \n \n  Reporter-Herald Staff Writer", "description": "Ten students graduated Saturday during the Center for Adult Learning in Loveland Celebration of Student Excellence and GED Graduation.", "ag": {"canon": "LovelandReporter-Herald:article:28132755:view"}, "startDate": "2015-05-17T19:56:25-0600", "og": {"url": "http://www.reporterherald.com/news/education/ci_28132755/graduates-accomplish-amazing-feat", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site47/2015/0516/20150516__17RHAGRADUATION~1.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Ten students graduated Saturday during the Center for Adult Learning in Loveland Celebration of Student Excellence and GED Graduation.", "title": "Graduates accomplish 'amazing' feat"}, "twitter": {"domain": "reporterherald.com", "description": "Ten students graduated Saturday during the Center for Adult Learning in Loveland Celebration of Student Excellence and GED Graduation.", "title": "Graduates accomplish 'amazing' feat", "url": "http://www.reporterherald.com/news/education/ci_28132755/graduates-accomplish-amazing-feat", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site47/2015/0516/20150516__17RHAGRADUATION~1.jpg", "site": "@reporterherald", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-05-17T19:56:25-0600", "sailthru.site": "reporterherald.com", "endDate": "2025-05-17T19:56:25-0600", "sailthru.title": "Graduates accomplish 'amazing' feat", "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "sailthru.section": "Education", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "google-site-verification": "XzsHDcJw4iXBQEYtDXFRaUAdKzxhSvxWMgXyQQNFFzg", "byline": "By Shelley WidhalmReporter-Herald", "sailthru.image.full": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site47/2015/0516/20150516__17RHAGRADUATION~1.jpg", "pubDate": "2015-05-16T21:24:46-0600", "news_keywords": "Loveland Colorado ReporterHerald schools education Thompson Valley"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1953\"", "article_summary": "( Shelley Wildhalm/ Reporter-Herald )Center for Adult Learning Graduates 2015 Taylor Baldwin, Josie Breighner, Christopher Cameron, Grace Karr, Justin Marlowe, Lynette Murray, Breck Neal, Angel Portillo, Lauren Sadler and Tessa Varela.\nSchwartz greeted four of the 10 graduates Saturday during the Center for Adult Learning in Loveland Celebration of Student Excellence and GED Graduation.\nTypically, the Center for Adult Learning in Loveland graduates 65 students, but this time there were fewer because of the new exam and the center's move, Merk said.\nThe ceremony ended with the graduates, who were the first to take a tougher GED exam.\n\"When I talk to graduates, they often say, 'I just got my GED.'"}
