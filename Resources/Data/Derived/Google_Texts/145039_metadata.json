Historically the \u201clabour-force participation rate\u201d fell during recessions as some of the unemployed gave up looking for work, and rose amid recoveries as discouraged workers returned.\n\nNot this time. The recovery is now five years old, yet the participation rate continues to drop, currently 62.8% from 66% in 2007. Cyclical factors may be at play: the slow recovery has driven an inordinate number of people out of the work force (or into part-time work); they may return as the economy improves. Yet the aging population means a growing portion of people have retired, and are not coming back.\n\nThe relative contribution of these two factors is crucial to the Federal Reserve. If cyclical factors are significant, then the unemployment rate understates slack in the labour market and the Fed can take its time about raising interest rates. If structural factors predominate, then the unemployment rate, at 6.1%, is a fair reading of slack and the Fed may need to move soon.\n\nOn September 17th Janet Yellen, the Fed chairman, suggested that she held the former view. \u201cThere is,\u201d she said, \u201ca meaningful cyclical shortfall.\u201d But that may not last if both unemployment and participation continue to slip.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Economist offers authoritative insight and opinion on international news, politics, business, finance, science, technology and the connections between them.", "pubdate": 20140925, "og": {"url": "http://www.economist.com/node/21620337", "type": "article", "image": "http://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/the-economist-logo.gif", "site_name": "The Economist", "title": "For whom the jobs toll"}, "twitter": {"site": "@TheEconomist", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "revisit-after": "1 day", "fb": {"pages": 6013004059, "app_id": 173277756049645}}, "article_summary": "For whom the jobs tollAMERICA has experienced a puzzling decline in the share of people either working or looking for work.\nThe recovery is now five years old, yet the participation rate continues to drop, currently 62.8% from 66% in 2007.\nHistorically the \u201clabour-force participation rate\u201d fell during recessions as some of the unemployed gave up looking for work, and rose amid recoveries as discouraged workers returned.\nIf cyclical factors are significant, then the unemployment rate understates slack in the labour market and the Fed can take its time about raising interest rates.\n\u201cThere is,\u201d she said, \u201ca meaningful cyclical shortfall.\u201d But that may not last if both unemployment and participation continue to slip."}
