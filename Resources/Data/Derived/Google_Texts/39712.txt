US authorities said Thursday they had found a “highly sophisticated” drug tunnel linking San Diego, California, and Tijuana, Mexico, complete with ventilation, electricity and a rail system.

US Immigration and Customs Enforcement described the tunnel as “a just completed, highly sophisticated underground passageway.”

More than eight tons of marijuana and 325lbs of cocaine were seized from the recently finished tunnel, located near Tijuana’s airport.

It hasn’t been utilized,” ICE spokeswoman Virginia Kice said late Wednesday. “We were able to shutter it before it was utilized to bring drugs into the interior.”
