Each plane in the Long-Range Strike Bomber program (LRS-B) is expected to cost roughly $550 million.\n\n\u201cWe have spent a lot of time understanding what is in the scope of technology. The bomber reflects the need for stealth, the need for speed, the need for agility as well as the value of situational awareness and sensors. We are going to exploit the best of the technology that we can bear within an affordable price,\u201d Lt. Pawlikowski told Military.com.\n\nThe website added that officials want the new aircraft to be nuclear-capable and have the ability to reach anywhere on the planet within hours.
