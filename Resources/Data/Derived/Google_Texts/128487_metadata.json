Many insurers say they lost money on this program in 2014 and 2015, in part because they underestimated how much care their new customers would use.\n\nSome insurers are so worried about losses on their exchange business that they have curtailed the active marketing of such plans. Kenneth J. Statz, an individual insurance specialist based near Cleveland, said major insurers were reducing or eliminating the commissions they paid to agents and brokers for enrolling people in marketplace plans, while continuing to pay for enrollment in Medicare plans.\n\n\u201cEven with all the cutbacks in the Affordable Care Act, there is still a decent opportunity for insurance companies to make a profit in the Medicare Advantage program,\u201d said Richard S. Foster, the former chief actuary of the Medicare program. \u201cThe marketplace under the Affordable Care Act will calm down over time but may not ever be as stable and predictable as Medicare Advantage.\u201d\n\nThe health care company Aetna said this month that its individual health insurance offerings under the Affordable Care Act \u201cremained unprofitable in 2015.\u201d Aetna\u2019s chief executive, Mark T. Bertolini, said the company had \u201cserious concerns about the sustainability of the public exchanges.\u201d\n\nBut the company is bullish on Medicare. It announced last year that it would acquire Humana, another large insurer, pending antitrust review \u2014 in part because Humana has more than three million people enrolled in Medicare Advantage plans.\n\nInsurers say they have done everything possible to shield older Americans from the cuts in Medicare Advantage enacted in 2010. Private plans offer financial protection to Medicare beneficiaries, through a yearly limit on out-of-pocket costs, and often provide extra benefits not included in traditional Medicare.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cSeniors are increasingly choosing Medicare Advantage because they recognize the tremendous value of this program in their daily lives,\u201d said Marilyn B. Tavenner, the chief executive of America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans, a trade group, who used to run the federal Medicare program.\n\nMany people under 65 have gained coverage because of the Affordable Care Act. But insurance markets in some states have been full of surprises for consumers and insurers alike, with volatile prices, nonprofit insurance cooperatives collapsing and enrollment in flux.\n\n\u201cIn the Affordable Care Act marketplace, there has been an enormous amount of churning \u2014 people dropping out, going into other plans \u2014 so it\u2019s been very difficult for insurers to predict spending,\u201d said Prof. Dana Goldman, a health economist at the University of Southern California. \u201cBy contrast, Medicare Advantage is a very predictable business.\u201d\n\nMedicare beneficiaries tend to stay in the same plan from year to year and generally give their plans high marks.\n\n\u201cThese are vastly different programs with vastly different populations and vastly different rules,\u201d said Christine Arnold, a securities analyst at Cowen & Company who follows managed care companies.\n\nInsurers and government officials are still trying to figure out the needs of people insured under the Affordable Care Act. In the course of a year, many people leave the rolls. Some fail to pay their share of premiums. Some qualify for Medicaid. Others get jobs that provide health insurance.\n\nThen there are politics. It took many years for Medicare officials and Congress, working together, to refine the formula for paying private health plans for older Americans. From 2000 to 2003, insurers pulled out of many counties, disrupting coverage for hundreds of thousands of Medicare beneficiaries. Enrollment declined and then grew again after Congress increased payment rates. But bipartisan support for Medicare Advantage increased as insurers enlisted beneficiaries to tell Congress why they liked the program.\n\nBy contrast, continuing partisan strife over the health law means that insurers are exposed to political risks. Neither party is willing to reopen negotiations on the law\u2019s biggest issues, for fear of the consequences.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nCongress did cut back special payments to insurers whose medical costs have exceeded their expectations, and those cuts contributed to the failure of insurance co-ops serving more than half a million people.\n\n\u201cInsurers want to play in this new market, but they are not completely sure what the rules of the game will be,\u201d said Michael E. Chernew, a professor of health care policy at Harvard Medical School.\n\nUnitedHealth, one of the nation\u2019s largest insurers, said last month, \u201cWe are off to our strongest growth start for Medicare Advantage in company history.\u201d Yet it lost $475 million on Affordable Care Act plans in 2015 and expected to lose a similar amount this year.\n\nThe company has said it will consider withdrawing from Affordable Care Act marketplaces in 2017.\n\nAndrew M. Slavitt, the acting administrator of the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, described such losses as \u201cgrowing pains\u201d suffered as insurers devised new business strategies and learned what products would appeal to consumers.\n\nBut he is also promising help. At a recent investor conference in San Francisco, Mr. Slavitt said he would take steps to prevent people from jumping in and out of the Affordable Care Act marketplace \u2014 buying insurance when they needed costly care and then dropping it.\n\n\u201cMost insurers will stick with it,\u201d said Thomas A. Scully, who was administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services under President George W. Bush, \u201cbecause they cannot afford to abandon this market.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20160212173732, "twitter": {"description": "The government-subsidized plans for older Americans were forecast to wither in the face of cuts under the Affordable Care Act.
