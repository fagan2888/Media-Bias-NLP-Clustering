[READ THE LETTER.]\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe senators also press Obama to set a timeline for himself and to make a final decision on the pipeline by May 31.That deadline would give Obama a few weeks to decide the fate of Keystone, which would carry crude oil from Alberta, Canada, to Gulf refineries.\n\nRight now, the State Department is winding down its interagency review, which is expected to wrap up in early May. Kerry would then need to make his recommendation to Obama, leaving the rest to him.\n\n\"We need a definitive timeline laid out, a timeline that reduces the comment period for federal agencies, officials and other entities. A timeline that requires Secretary Kerry to present you with his national interest determination shortly after the comment and consultation period ends. This decision must not drag on into the summer,\" the letter sent to the White House Thursday morning states.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis process has been exhaustive in its time, breadth, and scope,\u201d the 11 Democrats wrote. \u201cIt has already taken much longer than anyone can reasonably justify. This is an international project that will provide our great friend and ally Canada, a direct route to our refineries.\u201d\n\n\n\nIt's no surprise Democratic Sens.
