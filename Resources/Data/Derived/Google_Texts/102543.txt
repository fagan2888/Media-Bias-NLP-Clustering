The new New York City schools chancellor will earn both her pension and salary, putting her total pay at more than $400,000 a year, the de Blasio administration said.

Chancellor Carmen Fariña will earn $212,614 a year in salary on top of her pension of about $200,000. Ms. Fariña worked for more than 40 years in New York City public schools, earning a final salary of $218,906 when she retired in 2006 as a deputy chancellor. Her pay package was first reported by the New York Post.

Mayor Bill de Blasio, who campaigned on message of reducing inequality throughout the city, said on Dec. 30 he would appoint Ms. Fariña to lead the nation’s largest school system.

“Chancellor Fariña is a lifelong educator who has given her career to the children of this city–and she’s come out of retirement at a time our schools need her,” de Blasio spokesman Phil Walzak said in an email. “With her deep roots in our school system, managerial experience, and instructional expertise, she is qualified like no other candidate to lead our 1.1 million students into the future. She’s earned her pension, and she’s worth every dime of her salary.”

Ms. Fariña’s base salary is the same as that of her predecessor, Dennis Walcott, who moved into the job after former Mayor Michael Bloomberg’s previous appointment, Cathie Black, resigned after three months. Mr. Walcott kept the salary he had previously been earning as a deputy mayor, rather than get a bump to the $250,000 the job had previously paid.

A de Blasio administration official said Ms. Fariña’s base salary was less than the heads of smaller city school systems around country.
