It doesn\u2019t include customers numbering as many as 100,000 who began the process before Monday\u2019s deadline, but did not complete it. So the number could yet increase dramatically.\n\n\n\nOfficials hailed record traffic to the federal health-insurance-exchange website as vindication of the politically divisive law. HealthCare.gov, the site whose hobbled launch in October became a political punch line and threw the initiative\u2019s viability into doubt, recorded more than 3 million visits on Monday, officials said, the last day of a closely watched sign-up period. More than 1 million calls were reportedly placed to an enrollment call center as of 8 p.m., and the Administration said early Tuesday morning that the site was briefly shutting down so engineers could refocus on providing relevant post-enrollment information.\n\n\u201cWe want to make sure that people don\u2019t lose their opportunity,\u201d Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius told KWTV in Oklahoma on Monday morning, the start of a final nationwide and daylong push to complete outstanding enrollments.\n\nIf enrollment does reach the target of 7 million, it could prove a powerful political counter to Republicans, who have long argued the law would collapse under its own weight and remain committed to repealing U.S. President Barack Obama\u2019s signature domestic policy drive. But much remains unclear about this latter stage, including how many people will complete the process, how many who enrolled have actually paid their premiums \u2014 Sebelius said the figure was 80% to 90% \u2014 and perhaps most important, what proportion of those enrolled are younger, healthier Americans. Officials have heavily targeted such so-called young invincibles because their lower health care costs spread the risk of insuring their older compatriots.\n\nRepublicans, who are again making opposition to Obamacare the centerpiece of their campaign in this year\u2019s midterm elections, remained as skeptical as ever on Monday. \u201cThe President\u2019s health care law continues to wreak havoc on American families, small businesses and our economy, and as I\u2019ve said many times, the problem was never just about the website \u2014 it\u2019s the whole law,\u201d House Speaker John Boehner said in a statement.\n\nExceeding the 7 million mark, albeit narrowly, will cap a remarkable turnaround for a website that was so troubled last year that Obama, as TIME has reported, considered scrapping the whole thing and starting over.\n\n\u201cI think everyone is going to be surprised and pleased at how this has turned out,\u201d Vice President Joe Biden said Monday on the Rachael Ray Show.\n\n\u2014 With reporting by Zeke J.
