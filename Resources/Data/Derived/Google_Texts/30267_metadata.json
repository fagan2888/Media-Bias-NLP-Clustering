What\u2019s that all about? Well, it\u2019s largely about the Republican Party going out of its way to destroy itself in Kansas by pursuing Republican Party policies \u2026 but never mind that. There are more important things to take care of right now, like saving this Senate seat, than an honest introspection of the party\u2019s fundamental ideological flaws. There\u2019s this independent running, Greg Orman \u2014 thinks he\u2019s cock of the walk. Pfft! Time to squish him.\n\nPolls are showing Orman, as the old Kansas expression goes, \u201ckicking Pat Roberts\u2019 ass right now.\u201d He holds a mid-high single-digit lead over the longtime incumbent, and the election is in six weeks. And with the Kansas Supreme Court ruling that erstwhile Democratic nominee Chad Taylor\u2019s name does not have to appear on the ballot this year, Orman, and the Democrats, will likely get the one-on-one match-up they seek.\n\nThe Republicans have woken up, recognized the challenge, and are just starting to respond in kind. The strategy, as far as we can tell, is tripartite. It\u2019s not creative, as campaign strategies go \u2014 they don\u2019t have to be \u2014 but there is some risk to it: If Orman ends up winning anyway, he may not find himself interested in caucusing with the Republican Party.\n\nSo, about that strategy.\n\n\u2022 Have every vaguely famous Republican in the country visit Kansas to campaign with Roberts. John McCain, Jeb Bush, Paul Ryan and Rand Paul will all visit Kansas in the near future. Also: Sarah Palin. They\u2019re even wheeling poor old Bob Dole out onto the stage, bless him. Expect any other luminary who\u2019s hoping to build chits within the party ahead of a presidential candidacy to pop up in the next few weeks \u2014 Chris Christie, Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz, etc. They\u2019ll all be there to explain to the decent salt-of-the-earth God-fearing folk of Kansas that this grand Republic of ours may well collapse if Pat Roberts isn\u2019t around for another six years.\n\n\u2022 Have Pat Roberts say crazy right-wing stuff all the time. \u201cWord on the street\u201d in Kansas was that after his narrow primary victory over some clown physician, Pat Roberts didn\u2019t do much campaigning at all. Now relaxation time is over, sorry to say, and the smelling salts have been issued to the patient. Roberts is cranking up the rhetoric to shore up support from the state\u2019s Republicans. It\u2019s just not clear that he is the most polished campaigner. Consider Roberts\u2019 remarks yesterday at an event with Dole.\n\nBut at any rate, we have to change course because our country is headed for national socialism. That\u2019s not right. It\u2019s changing our culture. It\u2019s changing what we\u2019re all about.\n\nWe\u2019re going to give Roberts the benefit of the doubt and argue that he\u2019s too dim to know that he said our country is headed for Nazism. But maybe in future speeches, he should change \u201cnational socialism\u201d to \u201csocialism, nationally\u201d \u2014 or just not say that the country is headed toward socialism at all, because that\u2019s obviously wrong. You wonder if Bob Dole, who\u2019s been critical of the GOP\u2019s rightward lunge in the last few years, and was shot by actual Nazis in World War II, heard that invocation of \u201cnational socialism\u201d and reconsidered his decision to show up.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Paul Ryan, Rand Paul and other \"luminaries\" are all flocking to Kansas, as GOP finally recognizes a mortal threat", "title": "GOP terrified of Kansas fiasco: How they\u2019re desperately trying to save Senate seat", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Paul Ryan, Rand Paul and other \"luminaries\" are all flocking to Kansas, as GOP finally recognizes a mortal threat", "title": "GOP terrified of Kansas fiasco: How they\u2019re desperately trying to save Senate seat", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/09/24/gop_terrified_of_kansas_fiasco_how_theyre_desperately_trying_to_save_senate_seat/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/02/paul_cruz_ryan.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Paul Ryan, Rand Paul and other \"luminaries\" are all flocking to Kansas, as GOP finally recognizes a mortal threat", "title": "GOP terrified of Kansas fiasco: How they\u2019re desperately trying to save Senate seat", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/02/paul_cruz_ryan.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Jim Newell", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, 2014 elections, battlegrounds, Bob Dole, Editor's Picks, GOP, greg orman, Jeb Bush, John McCain, Kansas, Nazis, Pat Roberts, Rand Paul, Sarah Palin, Senate, The Right", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb84c\"", "article_summary": "Well, it\u2019s largely about the Republican Party going out of its way to destroy itself in Kansas by pursuing Republican Party policies \u2026 but never mind that.\n\u2022 Have Pat Roberts say crazy right-wing stuff all the time.\n\u201cWord on the street\u201d in Kansas was that after his narrow primary victory over some clown physician, Pat Roberts didn\u2019t do much campaigning at all.\nThere are more important things to take care of right now, like saving this Senate seat, than an honest introspection of the party\u2019s fundamental ideological flaws.\n\u2022 Have every vaguely famous Republican in the country visit Kansas to campaign with Roberts."}
