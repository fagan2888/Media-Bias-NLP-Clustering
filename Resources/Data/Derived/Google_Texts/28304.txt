According to a police report, Singletary invited her boyfriend, a U.S. Capitol Police officer, over for sex before threatening him with his own service weapon, demanding to see the contents of his cell phones.

“You taught me how to use this. Don’t think I won’t use it,” Singleterry said according to the arrest warrant obtained by NBC News, referring to the gun.

Singletary was upset about another woman that her boyfriend was dating, according to the report.

During the White House press briefing today, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest confirmed that Singleterry had been placed on leave.

“We are aware of the matter and have temporarily placed the employee in question on unpaid leave and revoked her access to the complex until we have more information,” Earnest said, before referring to the local police department for details.

Before joining the White House as a special assistant to President Obama, Singletary served nearly 15 years with Assistant Democratic Leader James Clyburn (D-S.C.)

She first joined Clyburn’s office as an intern in 2000.
