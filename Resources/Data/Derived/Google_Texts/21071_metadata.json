You need to bring a photo ID and a copy of your discharge papers also known as a DD214. If you do not have a copy of your DD214, the hospital can try to pull your records.\n\n\u201cThat does take a little bit of time,\u201d said Martin Littlejohn, patient benefits supervisor. \u201cEverything processes through in about 30 minutes.\u201d\n\nBut if you are feeling ill or it\u2019s an urgent situation the hospital can try and get you registered even faster.\n\n\u201cSay you have the cold or the flu; we have do have an urgent care and the administrative officers over there can take care of all the paperwork while you are getting checked out,\u201d said Darin Farr with the VA public affairs office.\n\nOnce the information is in the computer it goes to a national database. A photo ID will come in the mail that is more secure than previous cards.\n\n\u201cThey changed where the bar code is,\u201d said Littlejohn. \u201cNow a member ID number that is issued by the VA has no identifying information on it. Your social security number is nowhere on the card.\u201d\n\nAny cost associated with care is based on income and if you have any service-connected disabilities.Once a veteran is in the system, requirements are met for the Affordable Care Act. In some instances a new or returning patient can start receiving care within a few hours after registering. It\u2019s an effort to take the worry out of going to the VA Hospital.\n\n\u201cYou should never hesitate, never take your health care for granted,\u201d said Farr. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to take any chances because if you are a veteran eligible for enrollment we have all different ways to serve you and help you out.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The VA Hospital in Reno is trying to take the frustration out of signing up for healthcare.", "language": "english", "author": "Paul Harris", "og": {"url": "http://www.kolotv.com/home/headlines/Making-The-VA-Healthcare-Registration-Process-Quicker-289529171.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/600*600/veterans_affairs_va_mgn_square.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "The VA Hospital in Reno is trying to take the frustration out of signing up for healthcare.", "title": "Making The VA Healthcare Registration Process Faster"}, "keywords": "Making The VA Healthcare Registration Process Faster", "fb": {"pages": 39225221502}, "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "google-site-verification": "0ZhUa7TQ_r1sSB7AzH3l8tpd9Mq-KDKQRH7qc8HMudg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Making The VA Healthcare Registration"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdebd8\"", "article_summary": "At the VA hospital in Reno they are trying to expedite the registration process.\nIt\u2019s an effort to take the worry out of going to the VA Hospital.\nIf you do not have a copy of your DD214, the hospital can try to pull your records.\nRENO, NV - The Veterans Administration healthcare system has been under intense scrutiny in 2014 with long wait times being exposed in places like Phoenix.\n\u201cNow a member ID number that is issued by the VA has no identifying information on it."}
