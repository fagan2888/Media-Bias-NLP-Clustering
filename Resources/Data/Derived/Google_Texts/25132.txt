While he campaigns to become Texas' next governor, Attorney General Greg Abbott (R) is also "not done" taking legal action against the Obama administration.

In video footage captured by KETK-TV at a Wednesday event, Abbott told onlookers that there was more to come in his fight for gun rights and against Obamacare, among other issues.

"Already I have filed 30 lawsuits against President Barack Obama and his administration and I am not done yet," Abbott said.

Back in May 2013, PolitiFact tested Abbott's claim of 25 lawsuits against the Obama administration, finding it to be true. An Abbott spokesperson emailed PolitiFact an updated list of lawsuits at the time, showing 27 had been filed since Obama's Jan. 2009 inauguration.

Abbott's Obama remarks arrive one day after his campaign released a web ad attacking rival state Sen. Wendy Davis (D) as an unready flip-flopper. Texas' gubernatorial primaries will take place on Tuesday, March 4.
