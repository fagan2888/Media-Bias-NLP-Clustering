But perhaps, in between his regular servings of Jonathan Chait, Ezra Klein, and Josh Barro, he snuck a peek at the October issue of the conservative arts magazine. He might have scanned an essay by Harvey Mansfield, \u201cMachiavelli\u2019s Enterprise,\u201d on the legacy of the first modern philosopher. It\u2019s a legacy that very much includes the president.\n\nIn the essay, Mansfield discusses the Machiavellian discovery of \u201ceffectual truth.\u201d What is effectual truth? In his 2007 Jefferson lecture, Mansfield put it this way: For Machiavelli, the effectual truth is the \u201ctruth shown in the outcome of his thought. The truth of words is in the result they produce or, more likely, fail to produce.\u201d Consequences matter most. \u201cDeeds are sovereign: When confronted by a necessity, Machiavelli advises, do not worry about justice, but act and the words to justify your action will come to you afterward.\u201d\n\nIn recent weeks the world has woken up to the fact that President Obama is one of the most committed disciples of effectual truth telling in recent history. Time and again, when confronted by political necessity, he and his administration have told falsehoods in order to achieve their objectives. The fallout from the president\u2019s lie that under Obamacare you can keep your health insurance is just the latest and most glaring example. The false explanation provided for the Benghazi attacks of September 11, 2012, and the misleading and occasionally fictional nature of the president\u2019s memoir and campaign biography, are two more cases of effectual truth telling. The thinker whose teaching influences Barack Obama the most isn\u2019t Frantz Fanon. It\u2019s Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli.\n\nThe president now says that when he was barnstorming the country for his health care law, he was telling people, \u201cIf you have or had one of these plans before the Affordable Care Act came into law and you really liked that plan, what we said was you can keep it if it hasn\u2019t changed since the law has passed.\u201d What he actually said, though, was much simpler: If you like your health insurance, you can keep your health insurance. The Washington Free Beacon counted 36 times when he said exactly that. Politifact counted 37 times. No subordinate clauses. No mention of granddad.\n\nThe president and his administration have been caught in an untruth, in a prevarication, in a false statement. And there are no doubts as to motive: If Obama had actually said what he says he\u2019s been saying, the chances of passing Obamacare into law, which were dicey to begin with, would have gotten much smaller. Most Americans already had health insurance prior to Obamacare, and the prospect of losing that insurance would have made them more reluctant to support the law, which they didn\u2019t actually support all that much anyway. Omitting the consequences of the law for the individual insurance market was one of the most effective\u2014i.e., effectual\u2014ways to win support for the bill from congressional Democrats. The obstacles to Joe Biden\u2019s \u201cbig f\u2014ing deal\u201d were necessities to be overcome. And President Obama overcame them by lying. The result\u2014a national health insurance entitlement\u2014makes the dishonesty worthwhile. Or at least it does for him.\n\nWhat happened in Benghazi is more complicated because of competing bureaucratic interests and the inevitable fog of war that descends over every deadly conflict. But the underlying actions are the same as in the Obamacare example: protect the president to achieve a goal, in this case reelection. The attack on the diplomatic compound in Benghazi that left four Americans dead on the eleventh anniversary of 9/11 was a political problem for a candidate seeking reelection partly on the basis of his claim that, since Osama bin Laden had been killed, al Qaeda was on the wane. The well-coordinated, heavily armed assault on the consulate also drew attention to the dubious legacy of the NATO war against Muammar Qaddafi, and to President Obama\u2019s failure to secure and protect whatever gains had been made in Libya.\n\nThat the Benghazi attack coincided with protests at U.S. embassies throughout the Greater Middle East, attributed to a mysterious and bizarre \u201canti-Islam\u201d YouTube video, offered the administration an explanation for what happened that minimized al Qaeda. Thanks to Gregory Hicks, we know now that the government was aware of the al Qaeda connection before Susan Rice repeated the \u201cspontaneous protest\u201d story on all of the Sunday talk shows. But these revelations occurred after the president had been reelected, and long after his challenger had stumbled in his one faltering attempt to turn Benghazi into a political issue. The effectual truth had served its purpose once more.\n\nBy no means is Obama the first president to speak in effectual truths. But he may be the first one who\u2019s been speaking in effectual truths since before he had an obvious political reason to do so. The president\u2019s biographer, David Maraniss, revealed last year that there were more composite characters and invented scenes in Dreams from My Father (1995) than Obama has ever let on. The future president embellished his life to give intensity and significance to his experience of race. He created an effectual truth in order to dramatize his psychological relation to his black identity. There was no immediate electoral necessity for him to do so (though there may have been a financial one\u2014who would want to return a book advance?). Still, Obama may have crafted his tale of racial self-discovery with an eye toward future battles in electoral politics in Chicago. Political considerations certainly played a part in his alliance with Reverend Jeremiah Wright\u2014an alliance he dropped at the first sign of trouble in 2008 by telling the effectual truth that he hadn\u2019t been aware of Wright\u2019s hateful rhetoric and ideas.\n\n\u201cHonest administrations are all alike, but each dishonest administration is dishonest in its own way,\u201d Michael Kinsley wrote in 2002. \u201cActually, there are no honest administrations. But each presidency does bring its own unique style to the task of deceiving the citizenry. And at least you can derive some truths about a president from the way he chooses to lie to you.\u201d\n\nWhat does Obama\u2019s use of the effectual truth tell us about him? It tells us that his ambition is staggering, that he\u2019s prepared to lie to achieve his goals, that dishonesty can expand the welfare state and win you elections. Obama\u2019s career has been an exemplar of the power of Machiavellian politics. But lately it has also revealed the weaknesses and limits of such politics. The effectual truth may only take you so far. That\u2019s a lesson Obama may have learned earlier, if only he read conservative magazines.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Free Beacon", "description": "Something tells me the president is not a regular reader of the New Criterion.
