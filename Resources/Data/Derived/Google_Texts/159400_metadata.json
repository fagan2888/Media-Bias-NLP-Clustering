At the time, about 4,200 Collier residents were insured through Florida Blue commercial plans.\n\nAccountable care programs were developed as part of the 2010 health insurance reform law, also called Obamacare, to restructure how medical care is delivered and paid for, to move toward a value-based system that rewards for efficiency and improving patient outcomes using measurable standards.\n\nThe federal government entered into contracts with insurers for Medicare beneficiaries, using the term accountable care organization, ACO, when Medicare beneficiaries are involved.\n\nIn August, the U.S. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid reported 350 ACO's nationwide saved $411 million to Medicare in 2014 and achieved improved in most quality measures.", "article_metadata": {"title": "New plan aims to give patients more case management service, better outcomes", "og": {"url": "http://www.naplesnews.com/news/health/new-plan-aims-to-give-patients-more-case-management-service-better-outcomes-26587826-3e83-6629-e053--361604221.html", "image": {"width": 637, "identifier": "http://media.jrn.com/images/florida-blue-logo.jpg", "height": 478}, "type": "article", "description": "<br /><br />Many Lee County residents in commercial insurance plans through Florida Blue Cross may get more case management help in the near future.<br />", "title": "New plan aims to give patients more case management service, better outcomes"}, "twitter": {"site": "@ndn", "image": "http://media.jrn.com/images/florida-blue-logo.jpg", "description": "<br /><br />Many Lee County residents in commercial insurance plans through Florida Blue Cross may get more case management help in the near future.<br />", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "New plan aims to give patients more case management service, better outcomes"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://media.jrn.com/designimages/logo-ndn-icon-144.png", "__sync_contentCategory": "premium", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\"Both organizations realize the importance of honing their population health management capabilities for improved outcomes,\" Dr. Brian Kiss, vice president of health care transformation for Florida Blue, said in a statement.\nAt the time, about 4,200 Collier residents were insured through Florida Blue commercial plans.\nIn 2012, the NCH Healthcare System signed an accountable care program contract with Florida Blue, which took effect in 2013.\nThe contract does not apply to Medicare patients who have Florida Blue coverage.\nBy Liz Freeman of the Naples Daily NewsMany Lee County residents in commercial insurance plans through Florida Blue Cross may get more case management help in the near future."}
