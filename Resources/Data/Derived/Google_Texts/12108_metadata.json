It wasn\u2019t a sneak attack; he\u2019d been telegraphing it for months. But it was still shockingly blunt.\n\nThree charter schools that were already approved for space-sharing agreements with district schools had their approvals \u2013 and their classrooms \u2013 yanked by the mayor. As a result, two schools planning to open their doors this fall are now in jeopardy and one school already in operation has to scramble to find space for 194 students.\n\n[Read: the good and the bad in de Blasio's education plan.]\n\nThe tragedy is that those 194 students currently go to one of the best schools not just in New York City, but in the entire state of New York. And it\u2019s in Harlem, an area more associated with crushing poverty than with academic excellence.\n\nSuccess is the reason charters thrive. No one is forced to attend a charter school. Parents choose these public school options because study after study shows that, on the whole, charters do a great job educating kids, especially black and Hispanic children and students from poor families.\n\nThis is why the mayors of nine of America\u2019s 10 largest cities \u2013 eight of whom are Democrats \u2013 have endorsed charters as a way to bring more opportunity to underprivileged neighborhoods. New York\u2019s Democratic governor, Andrew Cuomo, also supports charters. Last week he gave an impassioned speech to a rally organized on behalf of the charter schools targeted by de Blasio.\n\nIt\u2019s clear that de Blasio is an outlier \u2013 a social-justice Democrat who refuses to acknowledge the extraordinary benefits charter schools bring to children, families and neighborhoods. If the mayor won\u2019t listen to Cuomo and he won\u2019t listen to New York City parents, is it too much to hope that he might follow the lead of President Obama?\n\n[Read more from blogger Nina Rees.]\n\nIn his 2015 budget unveiled last week, the president requested $248 million for the federal Charter Schools Program, which provides vital start-up funding for charter schools. I think the federal government can do more to help good charters get off the ground, and I hope the president and Congress will work together to find more resources for the Charter Schools Program. But Obama\u2019s commitment to charter schools stands in stark contrast to de Blasio\u2019s decision to strip $210 million of charter funding out of New York City\u2019s capital plan and to put a moratorium on any new charters being approved.", "article_metadata": {"zone": "nine-rees/blogentries", "keyword": "Politics [News]", "title": "Bill de Blasio Has an Extreme Position on Charter Schools", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "The New York City mayor has an extreme position on charter schools.", "title": "De Blasio Stands Alone", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/opinion/blogs/nina-rees/2014/03/10/bill-de-blasio-has-an-extreme-position-on-charter-schools", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/1f/b8/4a83971e4160bfc2750dbcae79fa/140310-billdeblasio-editorial.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@USNews", "description": "The New York City mayor has an extreme position on charter schools.", "card": "summary", "title": "Bill de Blasio Has an Extreme Position on Charter Schools"}, "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "site": "opinion", "date_published": "March 10, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "Nina Rees,education,charter schools,New York City,politics,Politics [News]", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "The New York City mayor has an extreme position on charter schools."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9db8\"", "article_summary": "New York City mayor Bill de Blasio recently launched the first strike in his war on charter schools.\nIn his 2015 budget unveiled last week, the president requested $248 million for the federal Charter Schools Program, which provides vital start-up funding for charter schools.\nThree charter schools that were already approved for space-sharing agreements with district schools had their approvals \u2013 and their classrooms \u2013 yanked by the mayor.\nIt\u2019s clear that de Blasio is an outlier \u2013 a social-justice Democrat who refuses to acknowledge the extraordinary benefits charter schools bring to children, families and neighborhoods.\nLast week he gave an impassioned speech to a rally organized on behalf of the charter schools targeted by de Blasio."}
