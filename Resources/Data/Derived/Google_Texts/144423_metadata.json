About 200 people showed up before the speeches began, most of them older Cuban-Americans, and some expressed deep disappointment at the turnout.\n\nAt the parliament in Havana, Castro expressed gratitude to Obama for the \u201cjust decision\u201d to release the men who spied on anti-Castro exile groups in South Florida in the 1990s and have long been regarded as heroes in Cuba. Seated behind the three and their families was Elian Gonzalez, the young Cuban rafter at the center of a bitter custody battle in 2000 between relatives in Miami and his father in Cuba.\n\nThe president closed his speech with \u201cViva Fidel!\u201d in reference to his older brother, who has not been seen nor heard from since the historic development was announced on Wednesday, provoking speculation about his health and whereabouts.\n\nThe executive orders Obama announced Wednesday can clear the way for limited exports to Cuba and freer travel by specific categories of Americans such as academics and artists, but he acknowledged his need to work with Congress to end the decades-old embargo Cuba blames for the dire condition of its infrastructure and economy.\n\nCastro reminded Cubans that the embargo remains in place, particularly limits on international financial transactions that Cuba accuses of blocking its access to credit and international investment.\n\n\u201cAn important step has been taken, but the essential thing remains, the end of the economic, commercial and financial blockade against Cuba, which has grown in recent years particularly in terms of financial transactions,\u201d he said.\n\nCastro confirmed he would attend the Summit of Americas in Panama in April, where he is expected to have further discussions with Obama.\n\nHis address to the National Assembly follows surprise announcements by both presidents Wednesday that Cuba and the U.S. will reopen embassies and exchange ambassadors for the first time in more than 50 years.\n\nThe agreement included the exchange of the three prisoners, convicted in 2001, for a Cuban who had been imprisoned on the island for nearly 20 years for spying on behalf of the CIA. Gross had been held in Cuba for five years for illegally importing restricted communications equipment. Two members of the Cuban Five, Fernando Gonzalez and Rene Gonzalez, already had been released by the U.S. As part of the exchange, Cuba also released 53 other prisoners.\n\nLate Friday, Cuban state television showed four of the Cuban Five celebrating their reunion by singing together during a private party in Havana.\n\nTheir release angered the protesters in Miami. Two women held up a sign saying \u201cImprison Americans and get three spies and an embassy.\u201d\n\nMost of the estimated 2 million Cubans living in the United States are in Florida, and they closely follow developments on the island. Thousands marched and more than 350 were arrested in 2000 after U.S. agents seized Gonzalez and returned him to Cuba to resolve an international custody dispute. When Fidel Castro ceded power to his brother in 2006, hundreds celebrated in the streets of Little Havana. And Cuban-born singer Gloria Estefan led tens of thousands in support of Ladies in White dissidents in Havana.\n\nBy comparison, Wednesday\u2019s spontaneous protests and Saturday\u2019s planned demonstration were sparsely attended.\n\n\u201cI think there are a lot of people sitting on the sidelines, tired,\u201d said Andy Gomez, a Cuba expert and retired University of Miami professor.\n\n_____\n\nE.
