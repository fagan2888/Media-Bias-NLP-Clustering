Triathletes from all over the world came to Panama City Beach for the IRONMAN Florida triathlon.

And Panama City Beach Police patrolled the area Saturday morning in a new security vehicle.

"We have a rescue situation, pick somebody up we can't do that with a regular ATV," said Lt. Danny McDonald.

This six-seater, 2015 Yamaha Viking 6, was purchased with grant money from the Ironman and Firehouse Public Safety Foundations.

About two months ago, beach police applied for the grant and were given $15,000 for the purchase.

The company HG-2 provided the blue lights.

And what makes this ATV unique: there's only one like this in the United States.

"The idea is that we are going to have it for all our major events at the gulf coast jam, at the music festival, spring break is going to be utilized," said McDonald.

Police planned on using the ATV for the first time to follow swimmers along the beach.

But the weather threw off plans for police and athletes alike.

"This is colder than Copenhagen," one athlete said.

"Let's see how it goes in the swimming, seems to be pretty rough," competitor Miguel Ponce said.

And rough was an understatement.

"To ensure your safety, we have canceled the swim," officials announced.

"It was a bummer, but I think it was a wise decision because Florida is known for many first timers. The conditions are rough and it would have been dangerous," athlete Guy Buyens said.

Event officials say due to severe riptides and high winds, the decision was a no-brainer.

"Our first priority above all else is to keep the athletes safe and sometimes they don't necessarily agree with that, but then again, given the conditions it was the right call," said Philip Lahaye, Vice President of Operations.

The triathlon became a duathlon with just cycling and running.

From 140.6 miles total, only 2.4 miles were eliminated.

While some were disappointed, as soon as the athletes got on the bikes, they were focused on crossing the finish line.
