That might help doctors identify drugs that would help you heal faster, bypassing the sometimes painful trial-and-error process and the hefty costs that burden our healthcare system.\n\nRight now, inside a lab at the University of California, Berkeley, researchers are working to make that happen. They\u2019re trying to grow human organ tissue, like heart and liver, on tiny chips. These aren\u2019t your standard computer chips. They\u2019re miniature networks, derived from adult skin cells coerced into becoming the type of tissue scientists want to study, that grow on miniscule pipe-like plastic chambers glued atop a microscope slide.\n\nThe research is designed to find ways to get that tissue to live and mimic how real human organs function. If so, they could provide a cheap and quick way of weeding out treatments that are toxic or just don\u2019t work. The aim is to weed them out early on, in the lab, replacing at least some of the tedious years of testing on animals and humans.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, because drugs traditionally are developed with a one-size-fits-all approach, clinicians often don\u2019t know how well medications will work on individual patients. According Anurag Mathur, one of the Berkeley researchers, these chips could lead to \u201ca personalized medicine, patient-specific readout of any drug you want to test.\u201d\n\nThe research is designed to find ways to get that tissue to live and mimic how real human organs function.\n\nFunded by $1.2 from the Cures Acceleration Network\u2014a new agency established by the \u201cObamacare\u201d federal health law\u2014the Berkeley project is part of a larger effort to explore what are called \u201corganoid chips.\u201d The Cures is funding several other biochip projects, and in a study published in the journal Nature Medicine this past May, scientists from Harvard University and other researchers used a \u201cheart-on-chip\u201d approach to research Barth syndrome, a genetic disorder that affects cardiac tissue. This type of research is still in the early stages, but if it\u2019s successful, it could significantly streamline drug studies and maybe even reduce drug prices.\n\nRight now, it can take billions of dollars and years to develop a single medication. For every one that gets the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s approval, 40,000 others don\u2019t make it through the process. That raises companies\u2019 expenses, and experts often point to these bleak trends as one of the root causes for the high prices for new drugs. If the organoid research pans out, there could be as much as a 10-fold improvement in the speed, cost, and accuracy of developing new drugs, according to Dr. Chris Austin, the director of the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCAT), an agency within the National Institutes of Health that oversees the Cures Acceleration Network.\n\nLiving Semiconductors\n\nThe technology borrows from techniques developed by the semiconductor industry decades ago to make transistors\u2014the building blocks of the modern computer. The ability to print ever smaller transistors at faster speeds allowed computers to shrink from expensive room-sized behemoths into cheap, widely available portable machines with many more uses than the inventors ever imagined. That revolution was seeded with money from the nation\u2019s space program, and now, some scientists say, biotech has a similar opportunity.\n\nOnce the blueprint is set for specific types of biochips\u2014ones that mimic the structure of the liver or gut, for instance\u2014manufacturing them could eventually cost as little as a few bucks, says Peter Loskill, one of the Berkeley scientists. The difficult\u2014and expensive\u2014part is making sure that the cells assemble themselves properly and that these microtissues work like the real thing. That\u2019s what the Berkley lab, run by bioengineer Kevin Healy, is focusing on now.\n\nEventually, scientists believe they could run multiple experiments on different drug candidates and various doses in different tissues at once. It would be something like the equivalent of a massive parallel computer, but for biology. Mathur and Loskill are starting with building a combination chip containing heart and liver tissue in collaboration with another bioengineer, Luke Lee, and his lab at Berkeley. If their work is successful, they hope to collaborate with other groups in the Cures Acceleration Network to hook up various proto-organs, Lego-style, to create a very simple model of the human body. This type of work could give scientists insights into how and why medications work on individual organs and how they affect whole systems.\n\nIn Lieu of Animals\n\nCertainly, some experts are skeptical. Fundamentally, they question how well these chips mimic real organ structure and function. After all, they lack blood vessels, so they live only for months at most. Plus, they don\u2019t replicate all the intricacies of real organs and organ systems. In the case of those that mimic the brain, researchers have said that the full-fledged circuitry underlying adult brain function isn\u2019t entirely there.\n\nMeanwhile, others question whether this work will ultimately translate into lower prices. \u201cRight now, [for] any drug that\u2019s discovered, people can charge what they want because there\u2019s no competition,\u201d says Atul Butte, a data scientist at Stanford University and co-founder of NuMedii, a Palo Alto-based startup that is looking for new ways to use existing medications.\n\nBut if they come to fruition, organoids could lead to even larger opportunities, beyond the speed of drug research and the price of medications. Today, much pre-clinical work is done in animals and doesn\u2019t always yield results that mimic how human systems work. \u201cThe knowledge gaps we face in biomedical research are enormous. We just don\u2019t know all that much about what causes diseases,\u201d says Bernard Munos, the founder of the Innothink Center for Research in Biomedical Innovation who also sits on the Cures Acceleration Network board. \u201cWe\u2019re really throwing darts.\u201d\n\nOrganoids can change that. At least in theory.\n\nKaiser Health News is an editorially independent program of the Henry J.
