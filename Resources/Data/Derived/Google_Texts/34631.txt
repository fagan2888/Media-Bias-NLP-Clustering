Cambridge City Family Health Partners, at 415 E. Main St. in Cambridge City, opened April 6.

Two family nurse practitioners will oversee the care offered.

The clinic offers hours Monday through Saturday.

Henry County Hospital has opened a satellite office in Cambridge City to serve patients in Wayne, southern Randolph and Fayette counties.

Cambridge City Family Health Partners opened April 6 at 415 E. Main St. in Cambridge City.

“We have a lot of patients driving to New Castle from Wayne County. This is a convenience for them,” said Ricci Atchison, public relations and marketing director for Henry County Hospital in New Castle. “We’ve had a great first week. The community has embraced us.”

Experienced and board certified family nurse practitioners Juli Taylor and Toni Wilcher are working at the office to provide care for infants, children, teens and adults. Licensed practical nurse Julie Blaase and medical assistant Brandi Jessee are assisting with care.

Patient care offered will include acute problems such as the flu or minor illnesses as well as chronic conditions such as diabetes and high blood pressure. If further specialized care is needed, staff will provide referrals to specialists at Henry County Hospital in New Castle or other facilities.

Occupational medicine services also will be available for local businesses, along with sports, school and camp physicals.

The clinic will be open 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. Monday, Tuesday, Thursday and Friday, and 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Wednesday and 8 a.m. to noon Saturday.

“We’ve set these convenient hours because we know it often is hard to arrange schedules to coincide with the usual office hours offered by most family medicine offices,” Taylor said in a press release.

Taylor said in most cases, an appointment can be made on the same day a patient calls. Walk-ins also are welcome, she said, however patients with appointments will be given preference.

Atchison said work began on the property several months ago. She said the inside of the building on the National Road/U.S. 40 was gutted and completely remodeled. Now that the weather is improving, Atchison said work will begin to improve the building’s exterior and the parking lot.

One or two open house events will be scheduled for the coming months, Atchison said.
