More than 20 employees beckoned store management to the floor and presented a petition signed by more than 50 of the store\u2019s workers calling for more paid time off, better health and retirement benefits as well as steady, consistent schedules.\n\nI worked at Whole Foods in the spring of 2012. As is the typical way of getting to know co-workers, I went out for drinks with a tight-knit group of employees. Conversations went quickly from the getting-to-know-you banter to politics, and it was at the time the Occupy Movement was running out of steam. We exchanged battle stories of political engagement and mused about how best to carry the momentum from Occupy in new directions. I asked about organizing at Whole Foods; a few of my co-workers smirked while others played dumb. A week later I was brought into the fold, and found people had been organizing for more than two years. I was feisty for action, but the others knew better; they were in it for the long haul.\n\nSince workers came out after plotting in the shadows for nearly five years, store managers have reportedly attempted to kill them with kindness, while saying nothing of their demands. On the corporate side, Whole Foods Market announced a pay increase in its San Francisco stores effective Jan. 1, shortly after the Whole Foods Union went public. The $1.25 increase in the starting wage, from $11.50 to $12.75, sits 50 cents above San Francisco increase in minimum wage that will take effect in May of 2015. Outside of that, both the store and corporate management have refused to publicly address the situation. Workers organizing at Whole Foods claim the announced wage increase four months ahead of schedule was likely in response to their demands.\n\nIn an attempt to put teeth to their demands workers held pickets at the Whole Foods Northern California Regional distribution center in Richmond, California. The picket fell short of stopping the flow of goods to the Bay Area stores it had envisioned, in the spirit of the Black Friday actions taken in 2013 by retail workers. Although the Teamsters did agree that their drivers would not cross the picket line. To that Ruan, the shipping company contracted by Whole Foods, hired temporary workers \u2014 scabs \u2014 to cross.\n\nOrganizing with the radical-syndicalist union, the Industrial Workers of the World, Whole Foods employees are shunning traditional unions that represent the majority of workers at Safeway, Alberson\u2019s and other national grocers. In doing so, they have given up access to the deep pockets of United Grocery Workers and the like, but have the added agility to stealthily maneuver. The IWW is also the only union to have successfully created union shops at Starbucks.\n\n\u201cOrganizing through the IWW gives us a lot of autonomy,\u201d said Nick Theodosis, an organizer and beer and wine specialist at Whole Food SoMa. \u201cAll the decisions are made on the shop floor.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s no secret that Whole Foods Market is hostile to unions. Its co-founder and co-CEO John Mackey has compared unions to herpes, and has insisted that his company is \u201cbeyond unions.\u201d Whole Foods is the second-largest union-free retailer behind Wal-Mart, a company that does not hide its hostility to labor behind progressive rhetoric.\n\nNonetheless, Whole Foods Market has been listed on the Fortune 100 Best Companies to Work For 17 years in a row. For 2014 the green giant was listed at 44, just beating out Goldman Sachs. While it\u2019s no surprise, Fortune does not consider organized labor as a significant factor in its metrics.\n\nMy first day working at Whole Foods, Mackey and co-CEO Walter Robb were walking around the store shaking hands with employees. Mackey \u2014 to his credit \u2014 has turned the ratio between executive and worker pay upside-down, earning a token salary of $1 a year; unfortunately those executive savings don\u2019t seem to be passed down. He was goofy, yet sociable, and after some chitchat about backpacking he let it slip to me that on the trail he goes by the name Strider, a confession that brought an embarrassed look to Robb\u2019s face. The trail name is likely a \u201cLord of the Rings\u201d reference to the humbly disguised Aragorn.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Despite the corporate talk of \"team\" and \"love,\" here's what working there was really like -- and why I had to quit", "title": "My Whole Foods nightmare: How a full-time job there left me in poverty", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Despite the corporate talk of \"team\" and \"love,\" here's what working there was really like -- and why I had to quit", "title": "My Whole Foods nightmare: How a full-time job there left me in poverty", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/12/08/my_whole_foods_nightmare_how_a_full_time_job_there_left_me_in_poverty/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/11/whole_foods.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Despite the corporate talk of \"team\" and \"love,\" here's what working there was really like -- and why I had to quit", "title": "My Whole Foods nightmare: How a full-time job there left me in poverty", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/11/whole_foods.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Nick Rahaim", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Benefits, corporations, Jobs, Labor, livable wage, Minimum wage, Poverty, Retail, Whole Foods, Workers, working poor", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd90ed\"", "article_summary": "Nonetheless, Whole Foods Market has been listed on the Fortune 100 Best Companies to Work For 17 years in a row.\nOn the corporate side, Whole Foods Market announced a pay increase in its San Francisco stores effective Jan. 1, shortly after the Whole Foods Union went public.\nWorkers organizing at Whole Foods claim the announced wage increase four months ahead of schedule was likely in response to their demands.\n\u201cAll the decisions are made on the shop floor.\u201dIt\u2019s no secret that Whole Foods Market is hostile to unions.\nMy first day working at Whole Foods, Mackey and co-CEO Walter Robb were walking around the store shaking hands with employees."}
