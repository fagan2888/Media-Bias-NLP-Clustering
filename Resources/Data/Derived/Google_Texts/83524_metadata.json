The virus was so bad among teachers, it closed schools Thursday and Friday.\n\n\u201cWe couldn\u2019t get substitutes,\u201d Superintendent Dr. Jerry Nash said. \u201cEveryone seemed to be sick.\u201d\n\nMore than 15 percent of the county\u2019s teachers were ill, forcing Nash to call a timeout. But an increasing number of students were sick with flu and strep throat, even though the number did not reach 15 percent, an arbitrary threshold for closing the district.\n\n\u201cTo be honest with you, the Affordable Care Act has handcuffed us a bit,\u201d Nash said. \u201cWe cannot let subs work more than 30 hours a week.\u201d\n\nIf substitutes work 30 hours a week for one-third of the year, they become eligible for employer-mandated health insurance under Obamacare, a budget breaker for many school districts. The district needs more teachers to work less hours, a seemingly impossible task in a small county like Hickman during a flu outbreak\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have as many as substitutes as we\u2019ve had before,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen they get sick, or their kids get sick, or another school district has them, it makes it difficult for us.\u201d\n\nMore than 91 percent of Hickman\u2019s 3,600 students were in class Monday, the superintendent said. Last week, attendance dipped into the 87-88 percent range. When attendance drops to 85 percent, that\u2019s when Nash said he considers closing school for student sickness.\n\n\u201cWe sent everybody home last week and said let\u2019s just sanitize the schools and go from there,\u201d Nash said. \u201cHopefully, that will break the cycle.\u201d\n\nHickman schools had a large flu outbreak before Christmas, too. Students were absent in the 10-12 percent range.\n\n\u201cWe thought it had come and gone before the holidays, but it came back with a vengeance.\u201d\n\nAt East Hickman Elementary, the clinic sits next to the principal\u2019s office. It was a revolving door last week, Manner said. Monday, traffic was down. Students at school seemed to be feeling better.\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t been hit with the flu like other schools,\u201d Manner said. \u201cWe haven\u2019t had a ton of students out. It seemed to peak earlier last week for us.\n\n\u201cWe were having anywhere from 40-50 students absent,\u201d she said. \u201cWe usually have in the 20-30 range, without the flu.\u201d\n\nThe school, with 480 students, had 43 students absent Monday. There were 56 absent Feb. 2, a week earlier. Ten full-time staffers were absent Wednesday, a huge gap in a staff of 60.\n\n\u201cI think it was a good decision to close schools,\u201d Manner said. \u201cIt\u2019s a tough call because we\u2019re preparing for Stanford Achievement tests in March, but it\u2019s better to close the schools than to have to go back and teach material all over again to students who were out.\u201d\n\nLaughter and high-pitched voices filled the school cafeteria Monday as students ate lunch. There were few sounds of coughing or sniffling.\n\n\u201cLast week, we had students who had temperatures and upset stomachs during lunch,\u201d school assistant Donna Gossett said. \u201cThey seem to be feeling better. They\u2019re eating more of their lunch, not raising their hands to say they\u2019re feeling sick.\u201d\n\nA large sign in the East Hickman clinic explains to students how to stay healthy. Most students at the school, who range in age from 5 to 8, might not be able to read it. But there\u2019s no mistaking the top line: \u201cWash your hands.\u201d\n\n\u201cI just ask everyone to be healthy and practice good health regimens,\u201d Nash said. \u201cI hope everyone washes their hands and comes to school ready to learn.\u201d\n\nJames Bennett is editor of The Daily Herald.
