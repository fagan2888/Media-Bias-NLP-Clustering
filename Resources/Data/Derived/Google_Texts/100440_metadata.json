No problem! Texas residents now can get some of the perks of dental insurance without having to pay a penny toward monthly premiums.\n\nDentegra Smile Club, a new program launched statewide in Texas today by Dentegra Insurance Company, is not insurance \u2014 instead, it connects members to discounts on dental services, pricing transparency and dentist reviews. Members have access to Dentegra\u2019s 2,200 dentists in Texas, who agree to charge Smile Club members their contracted fees.\n\nDentegra Smile Club membership is available to Texas residents free of charge; there are no membership dues or fees for club membership. The club was made available statewide following a successful three-month pilot program in the Austin area.\n\n\u201cDentegra Smile Club offers a great opportunity to those who don\u2019t have dental insurance to reap discounts on dental services,\u201d said Belinda Martinez, Dentegra\u2019s senior VP of sales and marketing. \u201cAll you need to do is sign up online and then visit a Dentegra network dentist for your dental care \u2014 since you pay the dentist directly, there are no claims forms to worry about, either.\u201d\n\nThe Dentegra dentist network \u2013 24,500 strong across the nation and growing \u2013 will help Smile Club members obtain cleanings and a significant number of the most common dental care services for fees averaging as much as 50% off the normal cost.* Dentegra Smile Club is not insurance; club members simply visit a contracted Dentegra dentist and pay discounted fees for covered services.
