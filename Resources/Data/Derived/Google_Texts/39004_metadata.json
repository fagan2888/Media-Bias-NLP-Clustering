For this study, the app Peek Acuity was used. The app features a tumbling letter \"E\" and requires patients to indicate on the phone what direction the legs of the letter are pointing.\n\nThe study included 233 Kenyan adult men and women. The creators of Peek are now testing it using a wide range of smartphones and operating systems, including a plan to use the apps for vision tests on 20,000 schoolchildren.\n\n\"With most of the world's blind people living in low-income countries, it is vital we develop new tools to increase early detection and appropriate referral for treatment,\" said Bastawrous. \"Mobile phone use is now so widespread that it seemed to be an ideal platform.\"\n\nThe study is published in Opthamology.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Researchers have shown a series of smartphone apps that test vision to be more than 90 percent as accurate as traditional paper and light tests.", "og": {"site_name": "UPI", "description": "Researchers have shown a series of smartphone apps that test vision to be more than 90 percent as accurate as traditional paper and light tests.", "title": "New eye test on smartphone is as accurate as paper test", "url": "http://www.upi.com/Health_News/2015/05/28/New-eye-test-on-smartphone-is-as-accurate-as-paper-test/5301432833980/", "image": "http://cdnph.upi.com/sv/ph/og/i/5301432833980/2015/1/14328380302381/v2.1/New-eye-test-on-smartphone-is-as-accurate-as-paper-test.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://cdnph.upi.com/ph/st/th/5301432833980/2015/i/14328380302381/v2.1/New-eye-test-on-smartphone-is-as-accurate-as-paper-test.jpg?lg=4", "description": "Researchers have shown a series of smartphone apps that test vision to be more than 90 percent as accurate as traditional paper and light tests.", "site": "@UPI", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "New eye test on smartphone is as accurate as paper test"}, "fb": {"app_id": 130795020312660}, "keywords": "Health", "google-site-verification": "vnkcuJA1Q89cLmy4OZpuQKOf5Jf6ny_RVh7BpxZ11a0", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Health"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdae2e\"", "article_summary": "LONDON, May 28 (UPI) -- A smartphone app was used to perform vision tests as accurately as paper tests and illuminated vision boxes during a study in rural Kenya.\nFor this study, the app Peek Acuity was used.\nTests carried out in patients' homes using the Portable Eye Examination Kit, or Peek, were shown to be more than 90 percent accurate when compared to the results of traditional tests done in doctor's offices, according to a field test study.\n\"Mobile phone use is now so widespread that it seemed to be an ideal platform.\"\nThe app features a tumbling letter \"E\" and requires patients to indicate on the phone what direction the legs of the letter are pointing."}
