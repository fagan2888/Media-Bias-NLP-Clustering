The defeat, combined with a lackluster performance, may wind up hurting the Buffs at the box office too.\n\nWATCH: Who has the better football program? CU or CSU\n\nSaturday, Colorado will host Massachusetts in the Buffs\u2019 home opener at Folsom Field. It could be one of the lowest-attended home openers in 40-plus years.\n\n\u201cAttendance will probably be in the low 30s,\u201d CU athletic director Rick George said. \u201cI\u2019d hoped for better than that. I\u2019m disappointed in that, but it\u2019s where we are and we\u2019ll continue to work hard to get people to support this football team and our department.\u201d\n\nLast week didn\u2019t help. The Buffs built up a lot of goodwill over the summer by talking about how much they improved during the offseason. Although it\u2019s difficult to quantify the impact on ticket sales, failing to live up to that hype, and looking too much like struggling CU teams of the recent past, may have hurt ticket sales for Saturday\u2019s game.\n\nAt this point, the Buffs can\u2019t change what happened in Honolulu. But they can begin the process of trying to prove themselves in front of the fans who do show up at Folsom Field, and to those who watch the game on TV.\n\nRELATED: Michael Adkins quick to get on roll in CU ground game\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really important,\u201d cornerback Chidobe Awuzie said of CU having a good performance against UMass. \u201cA lot of people have been doubting us. We\u2019re confident. That\u2019s the mind-set we have to have, that we can\u2019t lose. As long as we have that confidence and Boulder\u2019s behind us, there\u2019s endless things we can do this year.\u201d\n\nThe key is getting Boulder \u2014 and people in other parts of the state \u2014 behind them.\n\nGeorge, while disappointed in the game at Hawaii, believes this CU team is capable of getting fans back in the stands.\n\n\u201cHaving watched this team this summer, I think (the game against Hawaii) was an outlier,\u201d George said. \u201cI think this football team has more maturity and I think we\u2019re a lot more confident. I think we\u2019ve got more talent. I\u2019m hopeful that last week was an anomaly and (against UMass) we really show people what we\u2019re about and start going in the direction that I think everybody wants.\n\n\u201cYou find out a lot about a team when they have to come back from that. They\u2019re opening at home and there should be a lot of excitement and I have every expectation that we\u2019ll be the team that everybody thought we\u2019d be.\u201d\n\nMassachusetts at CU\n\nA look at three key story lines for Saturday\u2019s game in Boulder:\n\n1. Who benefits from last week?\n\nCU played last week but lost 28-20 at Hawaii. Saturday is Massachusetts\u2019 season opener. Do the Minutemen benefit more from getting to see what CU did last week and what Hawaii did to beat CU? Or does CU have the advantage because UMass will be dealing with first-game jitters while playing on the road?\n\n2. Who plays in the running game for CU?\n\nSenior tailback Christian Powell got the start last week but fumbled early and had only five carries in Honolulu. Junior Michael Adkins II, listed as No. 3 on the depth chart, got the bulk of the work, gaining 90 yards on 22 carries and scoring two touchdowns. CU coaches seem inclined to experiment further with the rotation, based on their comments this week. Will we see more of Powell, or will CU ride Adkins again?\n\n3. The Buffs wouldn\u2019t dare look past UMass, would they?\n\nYou wouldn\u2019t think a team riding a nine-game losing streak would look past an opponent while playing its home opener, especially given that CU struggled to subdue UMass last year on the road (winning 41-38). But does CU have Colorado State in the back of its mind, with that rivalry game looming next week in Denver? CU needs a win to take some momentum and confidence into the CSU game.\n\nJohn Meyer, The Denver Post\n\nSaturday\u2019s area college football games\n\nNoon Massachusetts at CU, PAC-12M\n\n1:30 p.m. Minnesota at CSU, CBSSN\n\n2 p.m. Eastern Michigan at Wyoming, ROOT\n\n6 p.m. Northern Colorado at Houston Baptist\n\n8:15 p.m. San Jose State at Air Force, ESPNU", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "CU football home opener to see fewer than 40,000 fans", "title": "CU football home opener to see fewer than 40,000 fans", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/09/11/cu-football-home-opener-to-see-fewer-than-40000-fans/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150911__CUHawaii646p1.jpg", "height": 432}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150911__CUHawaii646p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-09-11T23:12:14+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-22T01:29:50+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "University of Colorado"}, "article_summary": "It was a tough way to open the season for a CU team that came into the year with high hopes.\nGeorge, while disappointed in the game at Hawaii, believes this CU team is capable of getting fans back in the stands.\nBOULDER \u2014 For everybody involved, watching the Colorado football team sputter through a season-opening loss to Hawaii on Sept. 3 was painful.\n\u201cI think this football team has more maturity and I think we\u2019re a lot more confident.\nDo the Minutemen benefit more from getting to see what CU did last week and what Hawaii did to beat CU?"}
