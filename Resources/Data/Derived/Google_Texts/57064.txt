Despite the warnings, worries and roadwork, the delays and headaches never really came.

Traffic on Interstate 25 through Denver on Sunday moved smoothly despite a closure where Colorado Department of Transportation workers were building a fourth lane.

Work that began Friday night on the stretch of road between Santa Fe Drive and the U.S. 6 interchange caused few — and in most cases no — delays along the highway and nearby streets where traffic was being diverted, said CDOT spokeswoman Amy Ford.

“Nothing major, just little bits of backup coming into the detours and then very steady through the detours,” Ford said.

Electronic road signs throughout the Front Range warned motorists of the closure, telling them to expect heavy delays. A headline on the front page of The Gazette in Colorado Springs on Saturday warned, “Don’t even think about a trip to Denver.”

However, those traveling through the heart of the city Sunday met mostly open roads with little traffic as it appeared motorists heeded CDOT’s warnings about the closure, avoiding the interstate all weekend.

Crews closed the Interstate for two extended periods this weekend, from 10 p.m. Friday to 8 a.m. Saturday and from 10 p.m. Saturday to 5 a.m. Monday.

About 100 CDOT and contract workers are demolishing the north half of the U.S. 6 bridge over I-25; repaving both directions of I-25 between Santa Fe Drive and U.S. 6; relocating three storm sewer lines across southbound I-25, and doing other work.

The new through-lane is part of CDOT’s $4 million “Gap Project,” which is designed to lessen congestion on northbound I-25 between Santa Fe and U.S. 6.

The lanes currently go from four to three and carry 10,000 to 12,000 vehicles an hour in each direction during peak travel periods.
