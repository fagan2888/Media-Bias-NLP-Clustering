Josh Miller, R-Heber Springs, failed in a 9-6 vote, falling two votes short of the 11 needed to clear the 20-member panel.\n\nUnder the bill, the state Department of Human Services would have until Sept. 1 to investigate options for providing services under the Alternative Community Services Waiver Program to about 3,000 Arkansans who now are on a waiting list for the program.\n\nNo later than Sept. 15, the state would have to begin implementing a plan to eliminate the waiting list by either adopting the Community First Choice Option \u2014 a part of the federal Affordable Care Act that would increase federal Medicaid matching funds for the services \u2014 or an alternative plan developed by DHS and the governor.\n\nSeveral disabled people and advocates for the disabled attended the hearing. Miller, who uses a wheelchair because of an accident, told the panel, \u201cI think my record shows that I hate Obamacare as much as anyone, but when something is right it\u2019s right, and when it\u2019s wrong it\u2019s wrong.\u201d\n\nDHS Director John Selig testified that Gov. Asa Hutchinson and DHS want to serve the people on the waiting list, who are people with disabilities who want to live in their communities and families trying to keep children with disabilities at home.\n\nBut Selig noted that a legislative task force on health care has just been created and said the governor \u201cwould like this to be taken up as part of the broader Medicaid reform.\u201d\n\nRep. David Meeks, R-Conway, said he also believed that \u201cit should be done through the task force.\u201d\n\nMiller told the committee, \u201cThese folks have been hearing \u2018if\u2019 for a long time. Let\u2019s pass some legislation that gives them a guarantee \u2014 and not \u2018if,\u2019 but \u2018when.\u2019\u201d\n\nMiller said later he planned to run the bill in the committee again.\n\nAlso Tuesday, the committee gave a \u201cdo pass\u201d recommendation to House Bill 1578 by Rep. Robin Lundstrum, R-Springdale.\n\nUnder the bill, an abortion could not be performed unless the patient has met with the doctor who is to perform the abortion at least 48 hours in advance and been informed of what the procedure will entail; the fetus\u2019 probable age and physical characteristics; medical risks associated with the procedure and with carrying the child to term; alternatives to abortion; and available resources if the patient chooses to carry the child to term.\n\nThe bill also would require the state Health Department to develop a DVD, printed materials and a website containing information about the physical characteristics of a fetus at different stages of development, medical risks associated with abortion and available resources if a woman chooses to carry a child to term. The printed materials and DVD would have to be presented to a patient at least 48 hours before an abortion.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m asking you to give women good information,\u201d Lundstrum told the committee.\n\nAshley Wright, attorney for Planned Parenthood of the Heartland, testified against the bill, which she said would restrict access to abortion and would require the Health Department to publish warnings of the risk of \u201cadverse psychological effects\u201d of abortion, which she said is not a risk recognized by the American Psychological Association or the American Psychiatric Association.\n\nThe bill cleared the committee in a voice vote and goes next to the House.\n\nThe panel also endorsed HB 1426 by Rep. Clarke Tucker, D-Little Rock, which would allow a state employee to receive up to six consecutive weeks of paid maternity leave. The employee would be paid her regular salary, up to a cap of $500 per week.\n\nThe bill cleared the committee in a voice vote and goes to the House.", "article_metadata": {"description": "LITTLE ROCK \u2014 A House committee on Tuesday rejected a bill to expand community-based services for the disabled and elderly and approved a bill to impose new restrictions on abortion.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "John Lyon Arkansas News Bureau jlyon@arkansasnews.com", "og": {"site_name": "Arkansas News", "description": "LITTLE ROCK \u2014 A House committee on Tuesday rejected a bill to expand community-based services for the disabled and elderly and approved a bill to impose new restrictions on abortion.", "title": "Panel rejects bill to expand services for disabled, backs abortion restrictions", "url": "http://arkansasnews.com/news/arkansas/panel-rejects-bill-expand-services-disabled-backs-abortion-restrictions", "image": "http://arkansasnews.com/sites/arkansasnews.com/files/field/media/web1_miller-love_0.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://arkansasnews.com/news/arkansas/panel-rejects-bill-expand-services-disabled-backs-abortion-restrictions", "image": {"src": "http://arkansasnews.com/sites/arkansasnews.com/files/field/media/web1_miller-love_0.jpg"}, "title": "Panel rejects bill to expand services for disabled, backs abortion restrictions", "card": "summary", "creator": "@arkansasnews"}, "keywords": "Arkansas,News,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-03-24T17:09:59-06:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=0.9"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1bcd\"", "article_summary": "LITTLE ROCK \u2014 A House committee on Tuesday rejected a bill to expand community-based services for the disabled and elderly and approved a bill to impose new restrictions on abortion.\nHouse Bill 1749 by Rep.
