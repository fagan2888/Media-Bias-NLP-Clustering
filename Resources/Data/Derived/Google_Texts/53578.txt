Champion dancers from across Canada and the United States came out for a weekend of dancing on the Akwesasne Mohawk Reservation.

A little rain could not stop the pow wow celebration, which was held on September 6-7, but it did move into the A`nowara`ko:wa Arena. The event was hosted on the Canadian side of the Mohawk reservation on Cornwall Island.

The awesome singing kept the participants dancing hard, and a host of contests and specials were highlights of the two-day pow wow. The festivities started with a spectacular grand entry at Noon; and later on, guests munched on Native food and/or enjoyed a cool lemonade.
