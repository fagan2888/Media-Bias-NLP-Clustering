However, he did hit back at the public nature of the expulsion of the top American spy in Berlin.\n\nRelated: Why Europe Won't Punish the U.S. over NSA Scandal\n\n\u201cAllies with sophisticated intelligence agencies like the United States and Germany understand with some degree of detail exactly what those intelligence relationships and activities entail,\" Earnest said late last week. \"Any differences that we have are most effectively resolved through established private channels, not through the media.\"\n\nMeanwhile, in Berlin, German officials started to back off angry statements made earlier in the week when the spying revelations emerged. German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier, who is set to meet with Secretary of State John Kerry this weekend, said that both sides needed to \u201creinvigorate our friendship on a frank basis.\u201d Angela Merkel\u2019s spokesman Steffen Seibert also softened the tone of German rhetoric.\n\n\u201cGerman-U.S. friendship is much broader and deeper than the narrow area of cooperation of our intelligence services,\u201d Seibert said, adding that the EU-US trade agreement currently being negotiated is still a priority for Berlin.\n\n\u201cIt remains a project that is very important to the federal government,\" he said.\n\nThe latest spying revelations, combined with revelations last year that the NSA was targeting Merkel\u2019s cell phone, have sunk German-US relations to the lowest point in a decade. The German public\u2019s anger over American spying has reached a fever pitch; if it weren\u2019t for the media distraction caused by German participation in the World Cup final later today, it would be even worse.\n\nRelated: For Merkel, the NSA Spying is Really Personal\n\nAllies on a Different Page\n\nLost in the controversy over American espionage on German targets is whether the spying is justified. Germany is an ally, but on a number of key issues, Germany\u2019s foreign policy often puts it at odds with the United States.\n\nFor instance, Germany and Russia enjoy a cozy relationship, both politically and economically. Merkel is generally considered the world leader closest to Vladimir Putin, a man determined to make Russia a rival to the United States, and often serves as a go-between for Western leaders.\n\nThe economic relationship runs deeper. Germany has attempted and failed to diversify the Russian economy by getting Moscow into the auto business. Some 300,000 German jobs are dependent on economic ties with Russia, and some $105 billion flows between the countries each year.\n\nYet the most important economic relationship between Moscow and Berlin is gas. Right now, former German Chancellor Gerhard Schr\u00f6der was the champion of the Nord Stream pipeline, which bypasses Eastern Europe through the Baltic Sea and will deliver gas directly from Russia to Germany (Schr\u00f6der is currently making his fortune as the current chairman of the board of Nord Stream AG). Schr\u00f6der also backed Putin when he annexed Crimea.\n\nRelated: The Woman Who Could Bring Putin to His Knees\n\nSchr\u00f6der was also a vocal critic of the invasion of Iraq. He openly questioned Washington on the international stage, and encouraged protest from the German public.\n\nIt\u2019s not just former German politicians who have publicly split with Washington. In 2011, Merkel abstained from the U.N. Security Council vote calling for military action to stop Muammar Qaddafi. This decision drew widespread condemnation from the international community.\n\nBut for those who follow German politics, it\u2019s hardly a surprise. German politics are governed by pragmatism, not moralism. In addition, the majority of the German public is against getting involved in international crises.\n\nThis was evident during the Ukraine crisis. While the majority of American allies called for sanctions against Putin and his inner circle, Germany balked. Merkel could have applied economic pressure that ended the standoff in its early days. Instead, she chose to wait.\n\nSpies Like Us\n\nGermany also has an active foreign intelligence collection service. The Bundesnachrichtendienst (BND) actively collects intelligence from around the world, including German allies.\n\nAccording to the National Security Council's Operations Security Intelligence Threat Handbook, the BND has a program called Project RAHAB, which actively collects signal intelligence.\n\n\u201cThe German Federal Intelligence Service (BND) is alleged to have created a classified computer intelligence facility outside Frankfurt designed to permit intelligence officers to enter data networks and databases from countries around the world,\u201d NSA found. \u201cThis program, code named Project RAHAB, is alleged to have accessed computers in Russia, the United States, Japan, France, Italy, and the United Kingdom.\u201d\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "There are many good reasons why the United States spies on Germany.
