But now he\u2019s taking on the issue of police brutality and murder of unarmed citizens in the United States. He\u2019s promoting a radical solution: disarm the police.\n\nMoore tweeted his demand that police be disarmed on April 30th, explained that in addition to this, community healing could come after \u201cevery African-American currently incarcerated for\u2026 nonviolent offenses [is] released from prison today.\u201d\n\nThe first tweet was posted at 3:16 a.m., in which Moore wrote: \u201cImprison you, shoot you, sever your spine, crush your larynx, send you to war, keep you poor, call you a thug, not let you vote. But you can sing for us.\u201d\n\nNearly an hour later, at 4:03 a.m, Moore added, \u201cHere\u2019s my demand: I want every African-American currently incarcerated for drug \u2018crimes\u2019 or nonviolent offenses released from prison today.\u201d\n\n\n\nofficial MintPress sponsor official MintPress sponsor\n\nBefore turning in for the night, at 5:05 a.m, Moore concluded, \u201cNext demand: Disarm the police. We have a 1/4 billion 2nd amendment guns in our homes 4 protection. We\u2019ll survive til the right cops r hired.\u201d\n\nThe United States Constitution protects the rights of citizens going about their business to be armed for self-defense. But when the Bill of Rights was written, there was no such thing as community policing in the United States, or even in Britain, where it would be conceived of, decades later, in 1812.\n\nThis has led some to conclude that the Second Amendment does not protect the \u201cright\u201d to be armed while \u201cpolicing\u201d citizens, but is instead the right to self-defense for people who are, essentially, minding their own business, and not those who are actively getting in the middle of potentially volatile arguments, where the presence of a firearm on the person \u201cpolicing\u201d conflict could (and often does) escalate the situation that could have otherwise been neutralized non-violently.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Michael Moore Calls For Disarming Police, Release Of Non-Violent Prisoners", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "AUTHOR": "Jackson Marciana | Counter Current News", "og": {"site_name": "MintPress News", "description": "Michael Moore Calls For Disarming Police, Release Of Non-Violent Prisoners", "title": "Michael Moore Calls For Disarming Police, Release Of Non-Violent Prisoners", "url": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/michael-moore-calls-for-disarming-police-release-of-non-violent-prisoners/205255/", "image": "https://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/AP799372174390.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-05-01T13:49:53-05:00", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Michael Moore Calls For Disarming Police, Release Of Non-Violent Prisoners", "creator": "@MintPressNews", "image": "https://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/AP799372174390.jpg", "title": "Michael Moore Calls For Disarming Police, Release Of Non-Violent Prisoners", "site": "@MintPressNews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"admins": 100003161352196}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/MintpressNewsMPN", "section": "Daily Digest", "tag": "Prisoners", "published_time": "2015-05-02T05:00:12-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-05-01T13:49:53-05:00"}}, "article_summary": "But now he\u2019s taking on the issue of police brutality and murder of unarmed citizens in the United States.\nWe\u2019ll survive til the right cops r hired.\u201dThe United States Constitution protects the rights of citizens going about their business to be armed for self-defense.\nMicheal Moore is famous for his documentaries on everything from 9/11 to corporate corruption.\nBut when the Bill of Rights was written, there was no such thing as community policing in the United States, or even in Britain, where it would be conceived of, decades later, in 1812.\nWe have a 1/4 billion 2nd amendment guns in our homes 4 protection."}
