Stanford is one of several Certified Enrollment Consultants working at the Doris Ison Community Health Center in south Florida.\n\nAbout 575,000 children \u2014 or 13.5 percent of Florida children \u2014 are uninsured, according to the American Academics of Pediatrics. The majority are eligible for Medicaid or the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program.\n\nMany of the children are offspring of undocumented parents who shy away from enrolling in anything involving the government. They worry someone will share their personal information with other government agencies, including immigration officials, and that they could be deported.\n\nThe fear of being discovered means countless children end up in emergency rooms simply because their parents waited too long to seek help.\n\nAccording to a study of 23 states in 2005, uninsured children visiting an emergency room accounted for 8.6 percent of the total.\n\nLeighton Ku and Sheetal Matani investigated and published their findings in Health Affair.\n\n\u201cFrom a policy perspective, the insurance gaps for citizen children in immigrant families are distressing, since they are eligible for Medicaid and SCHIP and are a major target of outreach campaigns. The insurance coverage of U.S.-born children of immigrants has fallen in recent years.\u201d Ku and Matani said.\n\nTheir study noted that children in non-citizen families had less initial access to ambulatory medical and emergency medical care and, even when they had access, often received less care.\n\nAnother problem involves dental health. A study in Washington state showed a trip to the ER was the first \u201cdental visit\u201d for one in four children overall and for roughly half the children younger than 3 1/2 years old.\n\nThe Doris Ison Community Health Center has a lot of experience in helping these people.\n\n\u201cHere we work a lot with seasonal farm workers and migrants who are undocumented. We serve (everyone) without asking about their immigration status,\u201d said Tiffany Helberg, spokeswoman for the health center.\n\nNone of this was lost on the people who work at the Academy of Pediatrics. The academy, in an open letter to the U.S. Senate, warned about the unintended consequences of health-care reform and the enrollment requirement as requisite for seeking care.\n\n\u201cAs advocates for the children we serve, we urge you to maintain protections in the bill against immigration enforcement actions occurring at sensitive locations such as schools and healthcare facilities as the bill moves forward. Health care facilities should be seen as a safe space for children and their families. To accomplish this neither medical nor health care facilities records should be used in any immigration enforcement action.\u201d\n\nThe academy also considers the immigration bill a \u201cmissed opportunity\u201d that should have been designed in such a way to ensure that every individual, especially children, are covered.\n\n\u201cAs children health experts and advocates, we remain concerned that the legislation does little to address the multiple barriers to accessing comprehensive, affordable, and culturally and linguistically effective health care services faced by many children in immigrant communities.\u201d\n\nAccording to the nonprofit Child Defense Fund, 7.2 million uninsured children in America are uninsured. Every 70 seconds a child is born uninsured, and each day 1,208 more are born without health coverage.\n\nContact Marianela Toledo at Marianela.Toledo@FloridaWatchdog.org twitter @mtoledoreporter\n\nWhat do you think?
