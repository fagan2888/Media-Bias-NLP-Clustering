Shots were fired at Aurora police officers Sunday night, officials said.

When Aurora police officers responded to a call in the 1700 block of Florence Way and Elmire Street around 9:45 p.m. Sunday, officers heard shots fired in the area, said police spokeswoman Diana Cooley.

Shortly after that, shots were fired at the officers, she said. No officers were injured.

There was no suspect information available Monday, Cooley said.

9News reported that earlier Sunday, a caller contacted the Aurora 911 dispatch center and left a threatening message that said, “It’s time you guys know that we are no longer playing around with the police departments. Aurora and Denver, we are about to start striking fear, shooting down all cops that we see by their selves.”

Cooley told The Denver Post she was not authorized to speak about the call and could not confirm that it happened.

Denver police spokesman Eranda Piyasena said Denver police did not receive a threatening call Sunday, although local law enforcement was alerted to a threatening call that the Aurora Police Department received.
