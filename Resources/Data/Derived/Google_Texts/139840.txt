Collin College named its sole finalist to fill the seat for the college’s district president on Saturday.

Neil Matkin, the executive vice president of the Louisiana Community and Technical College System, beat out 39 other applicants to secure the position. Matkin will replace Cary A. Isreal, who announced his resignation in September after nearly 16 years in the position, said spokeswoman Lisa Vasquez.

Matkin has “impressive credentials as well as extensive experience in higher education leadership,” Vasquez said in a new release.

The board narrowed the field to seven candidates in January and brought back two finalists in February for final interviews and campus meetings.

Matkin served as president of the Central Campus of San Jacinto College and acted in administrative and staff roles with the Virginia Community College System, the Illinois Board of Higher Education and Ambassador University in Big Sandy, Texas, where he graduated with a bachelor’s in liberal arts and theology.

He also earned a Master of Science in management of telecommunications from Golden Gate University, a MBA from the University of Dallas and a Doctorate of Education from Texas A&M University in Commerce.

Matkin will officially assume the position as the third district president in March. The community college has seven campuses in Plano, McKinney, Frisco, Allen and Rockwall.
