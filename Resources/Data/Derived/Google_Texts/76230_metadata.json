C., shortly after 2pm on Friday, April 11. The 65-million-year-old skeleton is coming packed in 16 crates in a specialized FedEx truck.\n\nThe Wankel T-Rex is expected to arrive at the Smithsonian before April 15. Shelley McKamey, executive director of Montana State University's Museum of the Rockies, said it is a great day for Rockies. But at the same time, it was an emotional moment for McKamey as he was part of the crew that excavated the skeleton in 1989 and 1990 as well as for Kathy Wankel of Angela.\n\nKathy found the fossil in 1989 near the Fort Peck Reservoir in northeast Montana. Kathy said she is upset to see the skeleton leaving, but is also equally excited as so many people will come to see it. The skeleton will act as a centerpiece of a paleontology exhibit expected to open in 2019 in the Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural History.\n\nSant Director of the National Museum of Natural History Kirk Johnson termed the news as to quite exciting. \"For us at the Smithsonian, this is incredibly exciting. It's a once in a lifetime moment for us, as a curator and as a museum. In 100 years we've never had a T. Rex\", said Matthew Carrano, Smithsonian Curator of Dinosauria.\n\nIt is said that at least seven million people will be coming a year to view the Wankel T. rex, which is considered to be one of the most complete Tyrannosaurus rex fossils in the world.\n\nAnother exciting factor is many of the visitors would be tourists. Therefore, these seven million visitors will not be the same every year. The skeleton was sent after a farewell ceremony organized at the MOR's Hager Auditorium.", "article_metadata": {}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde0b5\"", "article_summary": "Sant Director of the National Museum of Natural History Kirk Johnson termed the news as to quite exciting.\nThe skeleton will act as a centerpiece of a paleontology exhibit expected to open in 2019 in the Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural History.\nThe Wankel T-Rex is expected to arrive at the Smithsonian before April 15.\nShelley McKamey, executive director of Montana State University's Museum of the Rockies, said it is a great day for Rockies.\nOn loan for 50 years to the Smithsonian Institution, the Wankel T. rex left Bozeman for Washington, D.
