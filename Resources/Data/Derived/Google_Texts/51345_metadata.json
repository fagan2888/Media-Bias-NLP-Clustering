Except maybe Wayne Gretzky. I don\u2019t recall them mentioning Gretzky. Odd.\n\nBut I digress. Maybe I was distracted by the sparkly pasties once the guys get their Mountie uniform off.\n\nHosted by Alex Trebek (played by troupe- member Ginger Darling), this is a whole lot of silliness with a lot of actual skin. The five gents are fine looking and apparently sport good senses of humor. They aren\u2019t your typical-stripper chiseled gym-bunny type, but as Alex tells us, Canada is really \u201ca nation of mild-mannered cutie pies.\u201d\n\nFair description. Except that I don't know a lot of \"mild-mannered\" people who whip their clothes off so frequently.\n\nThere\u2019s a lumberjack scene that could give you chainsaw envy and a fun bit about how Canada\u2019s healthcare system beats Obamacare. Sexy nurses, anyone?\n\nA bit about a children\u2019s book goes on too long, but a Justin Bieber number is quite amusing. At any rate, the audience is mainly there for one thing. To quote Alex again: \u201cAn eyeful of Canadian bacon.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Fringe Festival review: 'Oh Manada!'", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Orlando Sentinel", "author": "Orlando Sentinel", "og": {"site_name": "OrlandoSentinel.com", "description": "So you wanna see some Canadian dudes take their clothes off, eh?", "title": "Fringe Festival review: 'Oh Manada!'", "url": "http://www.orlandosentinel.com/entertainment/arts-and-theater/the-artistic-type/os-oh-manada-fringe-review-20160523-story.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-57438f93/turbine/os-oh-manada-fringe-review-20160523", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp13.17", "twitter": {"site": "@orlandosentinel", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "AAC9C18F70AC386BC4DCF4DDF9BF1786", "robots": "index,follow", "keywords": "Orlando Fringe Festival", "fb": {"admins": 100004353067097, "page_id": 5779052556, "app_id": 890804050949750}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=402223551, app-argument=http://www.orlandosentinel.com/deeplinkid/87304987", "googlebot-news": "index", "date": "2016-05-23", "Description": "Orlando Sentinel Fringe Festival review: 'Oh Manada!'", "y_key": "fb73650ad672fe45", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Orlando Fringe Festival"}, "article_summary": "I\u2019m allowed the lame \u201ceh\u201d joke because the Boylesque TO troupe that performs \u201cOh Manada!\u201d emply every other Canadian reference we Americans have ever heard.\nExcept that I don't know a lot of \"mild-mannered\" people who whip their clothes off so frequently.\nExcept maybe Wayne Gretzky.\nHosted by Alex Trebek (played by troupe- member Ginger Darling), this is a whole lot of silliness with a lot of actual skin.\nThey aren\u2019t your typical-stripper chiseled gym-bunny type, but as Alex tells us, Canada is really \u201ca nation of mild-mannered cutie pies.\u201dFair description."}
