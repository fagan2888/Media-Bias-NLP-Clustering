That\u2019s not by luck.\u201d\n\nNot by luck, because most of these files are for medical debt. The Affordable Care Act has expanded coverage to more than 10 million Americans who were previously without health insurance, and provided subsidies to millions more. But it hasn\u2019t changed much for those who have fallen behind in paying for healthcare.\n\nJudge Roy spends a big chunk of his workday signing judgments against people who owe money to hospitals and medical providers. \u201cIt\u2019s like the tide coming in every week, he says.\n\nMedical debt affects one of every four Americans, and accounts for more than half of all bankruptcies. At age 60, Scott Cliett says he\u2019s in debt for the first time in his life. Cliett got free health coverage through Obamacare for the first time since he lost his accounting job during the recession.\n\nBut he\u2019s still struggling to pay off debt from an emergency room visit before he got Obamacare. When he missed a $25 installment after making monthly payments on-time for more than two years, Cliett wound up in court.\n\n\u201cThe Judge did allow me to speak, but the fact that I admitted I do owe them money pretty much cut everything else off,\u201d Cliett says, reflecting on his day in court. \u201c\u2018You know, I\u2019m sympathetic to your plight, but I have to follow the letter of the law: you owe them money so therefore I\u2019m granting the judgment.\u2019\u201d\n\nFor the past five years, chronic pancreatitis has regularly sent Cliett to the hospital for a week at a time, with a tab in the tens of thousands of dollars. When he was uninsured, most of this was forgiven by the local hospital\u2019s charity care program.\n\nBut since Cliett\u2019s health keeps him from working consistently, he\u2019s barely made a dent paying off the remainder, things like a $4000 ambulance ride. \u201cLet\u2019s see, $4000 divided by twenty five dollars,\u201d he says. \u201cMy grandkids will probably be paying this off when I\u2019m gone.\u201d\n\nOverall, gaps in coverage like Cliett\u2019s are the exception to the rule. The vast majority of people with medical debt have insurance the whole time those costs are piling up. But the bills insurance doesn\u2019t cover can be devastating on their own.\n\nThat\u2019s one reason Dr. Steffie Woolhandler, who teaches health policy at City University of New York, says health insurance is often a \u2018defective product.\u2019\n\n\u201cPeople buy it in good faith to try and get medical care and make sure their bills are paid, and then when they get an expensive or prolonged illness, it doesn\u2019t work,\u201d she says.\n\nWoolhandler says Obamacare has definitely helped. But \u201cunderinsurance\u201d--when a policy has high out-of-pocket costs--is still far too common.\n\nCopyright 2015 Northwest News Network", "article_metadata": {"category": "Northwest News", "description": "At the Yakima County courthouse, Presiding District Court Judge Kevin Roy walks past a rattling dot-matrix printer and long rows of color-coded folders to", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://nwpr.org/post/healthcare-reform-leaves-widespread-medical-debt-largely-untouched", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/nwpr/files/styles/medium/public/201504/district_court_judge_kevin_roy_says_medical_debt_comprises_well_over_half_the_court_files_awaiting_his_signature_each_week.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "At the Yakima County courthouse, Presiding District Court Judge Kevin Roy walks past a rattling dot-matrix printer and long rows of color-coded folders to", "title": "Healthcare Reform Leaves Widespread Medical Debt Largely Untouched"}, "story_id": 401223627, "twitter": {"site": "@NWPublicRadio", "card": "summary", "creator": "@NWPublicRadio"}, "author": "Rowan Moore Gerety", "org_id": 0, "dc": {"title": "Healthcare Reform Leaves Widespread Medical Debt Largely Untouched"}, "nid": 61793, "datePublished": "2015-04-21", "keywords": "Medical, debt, health insurance", "wordCount": 980, "has_audio": 1, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2e3b\"", "article_summary": "That\u2019s not by luck.\u201dNot by luck, because most of these files are for medical debt.\nMedical debt affects one of every four Americans, and accounts for more than half of all bankruptcies.\nThe vast majority of people with medical debt have insurance the whole time those costs are piling up.\nThe Affordable Care Act has expanded coverage to more than 10 million Americans who were previously without health insurance, and provided subsidies to millions more.\nJudge Roy spends a big chunk of his workday signing judgments against people who owe money to hospitals and medical providers."}
