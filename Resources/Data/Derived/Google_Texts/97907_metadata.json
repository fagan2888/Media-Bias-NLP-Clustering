Dustin Brummett has been arrested for aggravated battery with a deadly weapon.\n\nEl Dorado police say Brummett and his girlfriend were arguing near Washington and Fourth Avenue when a neighbor intervened.\n\nLate Friday night, Roy Nelson and his family were moving into a home on the 400 block of West Fourth Ave. when he says he heard something disturbing.\n\n\"Over across the street I heard a man and a woman getting into an argument,\" says Nelson. \"I could tell the man was drunk. I could tell the woman was pleading with him to leave.\"\n\nA woman who lives across the street tells KAKE News the couple was at a party at her house, then took the argument outside.\n\n\"You punched me is what she was saying,\" adds Nelson.\n\nNelson says no one else was doing anything about the domestic violence unfolding in front of him.\n\n\"Somebody had to help her,\" he says.\n\nNelson ran over and intervened, but the confrontation turned into much more than he expected.\n\n\"I was ready to throw down and fight,\" says Nelson. \"He knocked me down and I grabbed a pole and he came up with a pocket knife and he stabbed me thirteen times. I could have died last night.\"\n\nNelson was rushed to the hospital, but has since been released. Stab wounds now cover his body. Despite the pain, he doesn't regret his decision.\n\n\"No I'd do it again every day,\" he says. \"I grew up in a household where I watched my mom get beat everyday. I didn't go over there for that woman I went over there for my mom.\"\n\nNelson hopes his scars serve as a reminder for those who are in an abusive relationship.\n\n\"If you're getting beat up by your man that's not love, I promise,\" he says.\n\nIf you know anyone who is a victim of domestic violence, call police or 1-800-end-abuse.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "video", "description": "Late Friday night, Roy Nelson and his family were moving into a home on the 400 block of West Fourth Ave. when he says he heard something disturbing.", "language": "english", "author": "Ben Jordan", "og": {"description": "Late Friday night, Roy Nelson and his family were moving into a home on the 400 block of West Fourth Ave. when he says he heard something disturbing.", "title": "Neighbor stabbed after coming to woman's aid speaks out about domestic violence", "url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/Neighbor-stabbed-after-coming-to-womans-aid-speaks-out-about-domestic-violence-304872081.html", "image": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/69C/7BB/69C7BB46FD7E4923AB0061C76357463C", "video": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/A0A/2FF/A0A2FF8C43974DF98637A9284727DEFC.mp4", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.kake.com", "description": "Late Friday night, Roy Nelson and his family were moving into a home on the 400 block of West Fourth Ave. when he says he heard something disturbing.", "title": "Neighbor stabbed after coming to woman's aid speaks out about domestic violence", "url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/Neighbor-stabbed-after-coming-to-womans-aid-speaks-out-about-domestic-violence-304872081.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/roy+nelson.jpg", "creator": "@KAKEnews", "site": "@KAKEnews", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "video_type": "video/mp4", "video_height": 288, "keywords": "Neighbor stabbed after coming to woman's aid speaks out about domestic violence", "google-site-verification": "H0mev8O__gMqb34WcvOyZgBXFMRQZvDAQ0YTSGJ9hGQ", "video_width": 512, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Neighbor stabbed after coming to, womans aid speaks out about"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdfd85\"", "article_summary": "\"Over across the street I heard a man and a woman getting into an argument,\" says Nelson.\nAn El Dorado man is in jail after a stabbing that sent a man to the hospital in serious condition.\nEl Dorado police say Brummett and his girlfriend were arguing near Washington and Fourth Avenue when a neighbor intervened.\nNelson says no one else was doing anything about the domestic violence unfolding in front of him.\nIf you know anyone who is a victim of domestic violence, call police or 1-800-end-abuse."}
