With the state budget nearly eight weeks overdue, Governor Pat McCrory took to You Tube Sunday to praise teachers and reassure them his office was continuing to work to raise their salaries:

“I want to let you know I’m doing my best, working very, very hard with the legislature to continue the pay raises,” said Governor McCrory. “We’ve committed to spending over $1 billion in teacher salaries during the next fiscal year.”

School districts have been struggling to get ready for the new school year that begins this week.

Without a firm budget in place, districts have reported teacher shortages in critical areas. Teaching assistants have seen their hours cut, with no promise of having a job beyond September if the state budget does not allocate enough money for their positions.

Still other districts have shut down driver’s education programs, uncertain if the money will be available to teach teenager drivers.
