This misalignment underlies some of the productivity decline we have observed in healthcare,\" he wrote.\n\nThe good news is industry experts expect healthcare to grow in 2014 so Kocher said productivity gains are possible if jobs aren't added. And there are signs of a slowdown in job growth. In July, FierceHealthcare reported the healthcare sector led all other industries in workforce reductions, cutting 6,483 jobs, the largest industry reduction since the 9,558 jobs shed in November 2009. And in August, although the healthcare industry saw a gain of 32,700 jobs over the past month, the Bureau of Labor Statistics' monthly jobs report indicates only 900 of these were in the hospital sector, FierceHealthcare previously reported.\n\nEven still the long-time trend isn't encouraging, according to Kocher. \"Unfortunately,\" he said, \"healthcare as an industry continues hiring far faster than demand is growing, adding 119,000 new workers in the first half of 2013, for example, with little increase in patient volume.\"\n\nTo reverse the decline in healthcare labor productivity, Kocher calls for a transformation of the system--both on the supply and demand sides. This means relying on innovative reimbursement models that reward providers for lowering healthcare costs and becoming more transparent in price and quality data so patients choose more productive settings.\n\nFinally, he suggests healthcare leaders rethink their labor force and eliminate jobs that don't directly contribute to better outcomes or deliver a concrete return on investment.\n\nFor more:\n\n- read the Harvard Business Review article\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nHealthcare adds 900 hospital jobs in August\n\nHealthcare's employment boom may soon flatline\n\nConfidence in health professions continues\n\nDown economy doesn't hurt healthcare workers' optimism\n\nHealthcare hit hard by July job cuts\n\nWhile hospitals cut jobs, CEO pay continues to rise", "article_metadata": {"description": "While many consider recent healthcare job growth a reflection of the industry's strength, a new article< in Harvard Business Review suggests otherwise, arguing it actually reflects a lack of efficiency in the industry.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "While many consider recent healthcare job growth a reflection of the industry's strength, a new article< in Harvard Business Review suggests otherwise, arguing it actually reflects a lack of efficiency in the industry.", "title": "Healthcare job growth reflects industry inefficiencies", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/healthcare-job-growth-reflects-industry-inefficiencies/2013-09-25", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "Bureau Of Labor Statistics BLS,healthcare industry,HR & Workforce Management,job growth", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "HR & Workforce Management"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1bfe\"", "article_summary": "While many consider recent healthcare job growth a reflection of the industry's strength, a new article in Harvard Business Review suggests otherwise, arguing it actually reflects a lack of efficiency in the industry.\nTo reverse the decline in healthcare labor productivity, Kocher calls for a transformation of the system--both on the supply and demand sides.\nAnd there are signs of a slowdown in job growth.\nThe good news is industry experts expect healthcare to grow in 2014 so Kocher said productivity gains are possible if jobs aren't added.\nIn July, FierceHealthcare reported the healthcare sector led all other industries in workforce reductions, cutting 6,483 jobs, the largest industry reduction since the 9,558 jobs shed in November 2009."}
