You work for yourself. Downside: no boss. There\u2019s no employer to provide health insurance.\n\n\"So then the Affordable Care Act was coming around,\" says Rachelle Lowe, a masseuse in Concord, \"what I found was it wasn\u2019t as affordable as I thought. And the deductibles are outrageous, so at this time I\u2019m still not insured.\"\n\nApril 15 is Tax Day. And this is the first year some people will pay a tax penalty for not having insurance under the Affordable Care Act. Rachelle Lowe says she can't afford insurance, so she's opting to pay the penalty.\n\nListen to the radio version of this story.\n\nInstead of paying premiums, Lowe has decided to deposit cash in a savings account in case she has an accident; like she did last fall, when she got a nasty gash on her face.\n\n\"It didn\u2019t need stitches, it just got superglued,\" Lowe says. \"And I thought - in those first few moments when I got hurt - about not going, and taking care of it myself. But I couldn\u2019t.\"\n\nAfter a discount from the hospital, the bill was $500. So far Lowe's saving money by not having insurance. But it\u2019s a big gamble.\n\nAnd when she filled out her tax forms she couldn\u2019t check the box that asks about health insurance. So she\u2019s paying a penalty, somewhere around $200. This year the law requires Lowe to pay $95 or one percent of her income, whichever is greater.\n\nBut for people like Lowe - and there\u2019s still maybe 100,000 in New Hampshire without insurance - so far it\u2019s as though the consumer protections and the subsidized insurance the law provides don\u2019t exist.\n\n\"They're Frustrated\"\n\nHelping Lowe figure this all out is her accountant, Robin Wells. Wells is hearing from other clients who can\u2019t afford insurance too.\n\n\"They\u2019re frustrated with still how expensive it is. It\u2019s just the penalty they\u2019re feeling it\u2019s not fair,\" she says.\n\nWells also points out there are other tax implications with the ACA.\n\n'If my clients get a refund, they do not even care about what they are paying. If they owe money, then I go through the explanation of why.' Robin Wells, Certified Public Accountant\n\nFor example, people who bought subsidized insurance on the federal exchange \u2013 but who underestimated their income when they bought those plans \u2013 may have to pay some of those subsidies back to Uncle Sam.\n\nNationally, H&R Block says 52 percent of its customers who bought plans on the exchange are paying back part of their subsidy. Halfway through this tax season, the country\u2019s largest tax preparation company says the average subsidy payback its clients are facing is $530.\n\nRobin Wells, the CPA, says it\u2019s confusing. So, on a scale of totally informed to completely bewildered, how educated does she say her clients are on how the Affordable Care Act will affect their taxes this year?\n\n\"I don\u2019t think anyone but CPAs are really well-educated on how it affects it,\" Wells says. \"I took an eight-hour class just on the tax implications of this this year. If my clients get a refund, they don\u2019t even care about what they\u2019re paying. If they owe money, then I go through the explanation of why.\"\n\nWells says that\u2019s when people have an emotional response \u2013 when they have to pay. And, in a sense, that\u2019s by design.\n\nPenalty Or Premium?\n\nThe 21 different taxes and subsidies in the Affordable Care Act are a series of financial and psychological levers. Ellen Meara, an economist at the Dartmouth Institute, says those carrots and sticks force you to answer a question: Do I want to pay tax penalty, and hope for the best with my health, or a premium, and at least get to go to the doctor?\n\n'In some sense what the act does is it changes the norms....If the norm is that everybody has health insurance coverage, then people start taking it more seriously. And the penalty is one way of making that more salient.' Ellen Meare, The Dartmouth Institute\n\n\"In some sense what the act does is it changes the norms,\" says Meara, \"and there is sort of a behavioral component. If the norm is that everybody has health insurance coverage, then people start taking it more seriously. And the penalty is one way of making that more salient.\"\n\nAnd it\u2019ll get more salient as the tax penalty ratchets up over three years. It will cap in 2016 at 2.5 percent of household income.\n\nRachelle Lowe says somewhere along the way, she\u2019ll be pushed to buy a plan.\n\n\"It\u2019s the one thing I\u2019m working towards,\" Lowe says. \"Certainly I have home insurance on my house, I have car insurance for my car. My son has health insurance through his father, which is great. But I\u2019d like to have health insurance as well.\"\n\nLowe hopes to have enough money saved to buy health insurance by the end of the year. If she does, she\u2019s likely to get another tax penalty next year, but not on her 2016 taxes.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Health", "description": "There\u2019s an upside and a downside to being an independent massage therapist.
