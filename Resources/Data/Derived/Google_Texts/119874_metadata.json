(REUTERS/Jason Reed)\n\n4098299\n\nThe fourth Georgia hospital in two years is closing its doors due to severe financial difficulties caused by Obamacare\u2019s payment cuts for emergency services.\n\nThe Lower Oconee Community Hospital is, for now, a critical access hospital in southeastern Georgia that holds 25 beds. The hospital is suffering from serious cash-flow problems, largely due to the area\u2019s 23 percent uninsured population, and hopes to reopen as \u201csome kind of urgent care center,\u201d CEO Karen O\u2019Neal said.\n\nMany hospitals in the 25 states that rejected the Medicaid expansion are facing similar financial problems. Liberal administration ally Think Progress has already faulted Georgia for not expanding Medicaid as Obamacare envisioned.\n\nBut the reality is more complicated. The federal government has historically made payments to hospitals to cover the cost of uninsured patients seeking free medical care in emergency rooms, as federal law mandates that hospitals must care for all patients regardless of their ability to pay.\n\nBecause the Affordable Care Act\u2019s authors believed they\u2019d forced all states to implement the Medicaid expansion, Obamacare vastly cut hospital payments, the Associated Press reports.\n\nThe Supreme Court ruled that states could reject the Medicaid expansion in 2012, as part of the decision that upheld Obamacare generally. Since that decision, the Obama administration has so far instituted 28 unilateral delays and changes to the health care law\u2019s implementation without congressional approval, Fox Business reports.\n\nFrom verifying eligibility for subsidies to enforcing employer requirements, the Obama administration has already taken a hacksaw to the health care reform law, but it has made no changes to the provision raising problems for half the nation\u2019s hospitals.\n\nWhile the feds wait for financial pressure to force states to act, several state governments have been taking things into their own hands. Some have criticized these moves as \u201chospital bailouts.\u201d\n\nFollow Sarah on Twitter\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
