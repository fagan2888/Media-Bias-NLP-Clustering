And implying that Mandela would have opposed legislation like the Affordable Care Act is to ignore the reality of the health care system that Mandela himself fought for.\n\nAfter bringing an end to apartheid rule, Mandela enshrined in the new South African constitution a fundamental right to health care for all citizens, and introduced a government-funded public health care system to help cover those who could not afford the private system already in place. That was the foundation for a new universal health care system the country unveiled two years ago, which is now expanding to cover the entire country by 2026.\n\nThis is not the first time conservatives have attempted to claim a fallen progressive icon as one of their own. Other figures like Abraham Lincoln and Martin Luther King Jr. have also been co-opted by the Republican Party in an attempt to re-write history.\n\nO\u2019Reilly, for his part, commemorated Mandela as a \u201cgreat man\u201d despite being \u201ca communist.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "While memorializing Nelson Mandela, the former presidential candidate likened the \"injustice\" of racial oppression to the \"injustice\" of affordable health care.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "While memorializing Nelson Mandela, the former presidential candidate likened the \"injustice\" of racial oppression to the \"injustice\" of affordable health care.", "title": "Rick Santorum Compares Obamacare To Apartheid", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/health/2013/12/06/3030141/rick-santorum-obamacare-mandela/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/santorum_tpftd.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "While memorializing Nelson Mandela, the former presidential candidate likened the \"injustice\" of racial oppression to the \"injustice\" of affordable health care.", "creator": "@AdamReports", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/santorum_tpftd-321x214.jpg", "title": "Rick Santorum Compares Obamacare To Apartheid", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-health", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/santorum_tpftd.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/santorum_tpftd.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2013-12-06T09:44:00+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd200\"", "article_summary": "Health Rick Santorum Compares Obamacare To Apartheid CREDIT:Rick Santorum, the erstwhile Republican presidential candidate with a penchant for controversy, appeared on Fox News\u2019 O\u2019Reilly Factor on Thursday night and memorialized the passing of South African leader and global visionary Nelson Mandela by equating Obamacare with apartheid.\nAnd implying that Mandela would have opposed legislation like the Affordable Care Act is to ignore the reality of the health care system that Mandela himself fought for.\nThat was the foundation for a new universal health care system the country unveiled two years ago, which is now expanding to cover the entire country by 2026.\nO\u2019Reilly, for his part, commemorated Mandela as a \u201cgreat man\u201d despite being \u201ca communist.\u201d\nThis is not the first time conservatives have attempted to claim a fallen progressive icon as one of their own."}
