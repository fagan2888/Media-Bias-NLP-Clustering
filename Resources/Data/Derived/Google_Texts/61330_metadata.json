There\u2019s no list of his policy positions anywhere on it. Given that he\u2019s been on every side of nearly every issue, that\u2019s not really a surprise. But on the campaign trail, he\u2019s slinging some serious policy:\n\n\n\nBillionaire businessman Donald Trump on Wednesday offered a glimpse into his presidential platform on healthcare, saying he would replace ObamaCare with \u201csomething terrific.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s gotta go,\u201d Trump said of ObamaCare in an interview Wednesday with CNN. \u201cRepeal and replace with something terrific.\u201d\n\nAnd it will the biggest and the classiest something terrific you\u2019ve ever seen! No one creates terrific things like Donald Trump! \u201cI went to one of the finest schools in the country for teaching people how to create things that are terrific,\u201d Trump said. In that vein, I present the rest of Trump\u2019s platform:\n\nEconomic Growth\n\nIn order to make America great again, Donald Trump strongly supports doing something totally awesome. It will be so totally bitchin that everyone in every other country will want to come to the United States to partake in it, but they won\u2019t be allowed to because they\u2019re all rapists and murderers.\n\nForeign Policy\n\nDuring a Trump administration, America\u2019s foreign policy will be the most stupendous foreign policy that any nation has ever had. It will be the envy of the world, nay, the entire galaxy.\n\nMilitary\n\nIf Donald Trump is elected, the U.S. military will not only be the biggest and strongest in the world, it will also be the classiest. Every ship, airplane, amphibious vehicle, jeep and tank will be gold-plated and will have the Trump logo, the symbol of the the most abundant and extravagant corporation in the world, painted on the side.\n\nEducation\n\nIn Donald Trump\u2019s America, every school will have a dress code and each student will be required to wear clothing from the incredibly elegant Donald Trump collection. In the interests of fiscal responsibility, however, this will be limited only to white students. Black and Chinese students, and the Mexican students who aren\u2019t rapists, will devote half their schoolday to making those clothes, thus preparing them for a career in the sweatshops. Those minority students who exceed the number needed for clothing production will be rerouted toward careers working in the gold plating mines or in caring for the lawns at one or more of Trump\u2019s mansions and golf courses, ensuring both opportunities and greater profits.\n\nDonald Trump also promises to establish a new cabinet-level agency, the Department of Incredible Superlatives, which will work to create new adjectives for Trump to use to describe his enormous, amazing, colossal accomplishments. \u201cAmerica cannot fall behind the rest of the world in the race to find new and prodigious ways to describe my overwhelming greatness,\u201d said the next president of the United States.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.patheos.com/blogs/dispatches/2015/08/13/donald-trumps-campaign-platform/", "site_name": "Dispatches From the Culture Wars", "image": "http://wp.production.patheos.com/blogs/dispatches/files/2015/08/Brayton.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "Donald Trump\u2019s Campaign Platform"}, "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/Dispatches-from-the-Culture-Wars-133264427037/n.3"}, "com.silverpop.brandeddomains": "www.pages04.net,patheos.mkt5005.com,www.patheos.com", "robots": "noodp,noydir"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce617\"", "article_summary": "EducationIn Donald Trump\u2019s America, every school will have a dress code and each student will be required to wear clothing from the incredibly elegant Donald Trump collection.\nbyIf you go to Donald Trump\u2019s campaign website, you\u2019ll notice that he has not a single word about policy.\nIn that vein, I present the rest of Trump\u2019s platform:Economic GrowthIn order to make America great again, Donald Trump strongly supports doing something totally awesome.\n\u201cI went to one of the finest schools in the country for teaching people how to create things that are terrific,\u201d Trump said.\nDonald Trump also promises to establish a new cabinet-level agency, the Department of Incredible Superlatives, which will work to create new adjectives for Trump to use to describe his enormous, amazing, colossal accomplishments."}
