The city\u2019s vacancy rate is nearly five times the national average of 1.6 percent and tops the list of the metro areas with the highest share of vacant houses. Five zip codes in Flint have vacancy rates of 14 percent or more.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s largely an unfortunate coincidence,\u201d says Daren Blomquist, vice president of RealtyTrac, referring to the water disaster unfolding there. \u201cBut there are some correlations. A place like Flint is losing population, has a lot of blighted areas, and has become a forgotten city on many issues. It\u2019s a city on the decline and that\u2019s evident in the vacancy numbers.\u201d\n\nRelated: The 12 States with the Hottest Housing Markets\n\nBlomquist noted that the vacancy rate in many of the top cities is a sign of underlying economic problems that has resulted in a mass exodus in homeowners and renters to other cities with better job prospects. Many of these vacant properties aren\u2019t just empty, he says. They are in very poor shape and often in unlivable condition. The high vacancy rates also hurt property values of occupied homes in the immediate neighborhood and, to a lesser degree, in the city.\n\nBy contrast, metro areas with low vacancy rates reflect a booming economy, where jobs are attracting new homeowners and renters, he says. Often, there are geographic or regulatory restraints on new home construction that depress the rate even more.\n\nNationwide, more than 1.3 million residential properties were vacant in February, down from 1.5 million in September 2015. The vacancy rate fell from 1.8 percent to 1.6 percent during that time, according to the report. Investment properties were the most likely to be vacant, with a 4.3 percent vacancy rate. The vacancy rate for bank-owned properties was 3.4 percent and 1.5 percent for \u201czombie\u201d foreclosures, homes that were vacated by the owners before banks took over the houses.\n\nRealtyTrac reviewed the vacancy status of 85 million U.S. homes in metropolitan statistical areas with at least 100,000 residential properties.
