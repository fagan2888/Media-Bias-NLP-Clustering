Bush's apparent point was to be wary of hasty, crisis-driven legislation. But liberal slammed his word choice as insensitive.

Including President Obama, who said "I think the American people should hear that and make their own judgements based on the fact that every couple of months, we have a mass shooting. And they can decide whether they consider that 'stuff happening'."

Bush's campaign called the reactions a "sad and beyond craven" attempt to "advance [a] political agenda."

He later tweeted a link to a local bank's relief fund for the shooting.
