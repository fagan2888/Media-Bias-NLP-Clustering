"They're going to take him at midnight and shoot him. I'm asking the government not to kill him. Please don't kill him today," Raji Sukumaran told reporters after visiting her son for the last time in prison.

Sukumaran is among a group of nine drug convicts, mostly foreigners, due to be executed at the Nusakambangan prison island in central Java.
