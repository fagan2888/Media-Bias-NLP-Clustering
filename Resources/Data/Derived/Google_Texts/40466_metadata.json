In addition to the Affordable Care Act adding millions of newly insured patients, an aging population is resulting in more patients with increasingly complex conditions. At the same time, the nursing population is aging, and potential retirements will likely strain the supply of healthcare professionals. A recent survey from AMN Healthcare, 2015 Survey of Registered Nurses/Viewpoints on Retirement, Education and Emerging Roles, provides an opportunity to measure the impact of these changes.\n\nSurge in Retirements\n\nOf the more than 8,800 nurses who responded to this survey, 62 percent older than age 54 answered \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cmaybe\u201d when asked, \u201cNow that the economy has improved, are you thinking more about retirement?\u201d These are not idle musings warns the report. Nearly half of those planning to retire (47 percent) say they will do so in the next two years.\n\nThe loss of these nurses to retirement will be a considerable loss in nursing supply, because more than half of working nurses are aged 50 or older, according to a National Nursing Workforce Study. As expected, many studies find that this increase in nurse-to-patient ratios will likely reduce quality of care and satisfaction. \u201cThe loss of intellectual capital, particularly the experience and wisdom that would depart along with older nurses, can create serious challenges,\u201d contends the AMN report.\n\n\u201cAn institution\u2019s procedures, safety and effectiveness could be compromised from the loss of the experienced nurses\u2019 interpersonal skills, institutional knowledge and ability to perform well under stressful situations,\u201d adds Marcia Faller, RN, PhD, Chief Clinical Officer for AMN Healthcare in a recent blog post.\n\nEnter Education and Training\n\nHere\u2019s the good news: Nearly three-quarters of nurses in the survey were aware of new and emerging roles for nurses, and more than 60 percent said that they would enter a training program for these roles, if one were available. The survey also showed that among all nurses, more plan to seek a higher degree in nursing than those who won\u2019t pursue further education. \u201cI believe nurses with current or up-to-date education feel more empowered to make positive changes in their work places and for their patients,\u201d notes one survey respondent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAmong younger nurses, more than three-quarters plan to pursue a higher degree in the next three years. The survey data on those currently seeking or considering a degree in advanced practice nursing is \u201cfairly astounding\u201d claims the report. In fact, one-third plan to work toward a bachelor\u2019s degree, and more than a third plan to pursue a master\u2019s degree.\n\nIn addition, among nurses younger than 40 years of age, more than one in three want to become a nurse practitioner or enter another advanced role. \u201cThis shows the enormous appeal of advanced practice nursing, likely because of the autonomy, independence and opportunities to provide a wider range of patient care,\u201d explains the report. Fortunately, the job market for them looks bright, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, which projects that jobs for advanced practice nurses will grow even faster than the jobs for RNs.\n\n\u201cIn the changing healthcare environment, nurse practitioners have increasing responsibility and authority over patient care. A much more robust and autonomous nursing practice is available to them than just a few years ago. Due to the acute physician shortage, advanced practice nurses are in high demand, and that will increase,\u201d concludes AMN Healthcare.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A recent survey from AMN Healthcare, 2015 Survey of Registered Nurses/Viewpoints on Retirement, Education and Emerging Roles, examines how changes in the healthcare industry are reshaping the roles and duties of nursing professionals.", "og": {"url": "https://www.td.org/Publications/Blogs/Healthcare-Blog/2016/02/Nurses-Need-and-Want-More-Education-and-Training", "image": "http://www.td.org/~/media/Images/Headshots/ASTD staff/ryann-ellis.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "A recent survey from AMN Healthcare 2015 Survey of Registered NursesViewpoints on Retirement Education and Emerging Roles examines how changes in the healthcare industry are reshaping the roles and duties of nursing professionals", "title": "Nurses Needand WantMore Education and Training"}, "twitter": {"site": "@atd", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "data-responsive": "true", "fb": {"admins": 789051966}, "keywords": "AMN Healthcare, 2015 Survey of Registered Nurses/Viewpoints on Retirement, Education and Emerging Roles, Marcia Faller, trends in nursing education, trends in nursing training, nursing professionals retire, ATD, ASTD", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Due to the acute physician shortage, advanced practice nurses are in high demand, and that will increase,\u201d concludes AMN Healthcare.\nA much more robust and autonomous nursing practice is available to them than just a few years ago.\nThe survey data on those currently seeking or considering a degree in advanced practice nursing is \u201cfairly astounding\u201d claims the report.\nFortunately, the job market for them looks bright, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, which projects that jobs for advanced practice nurses will grow even faster than the jobs for RNs.\n\u201cThis shows the enormous appeal of advanced practice nursing, likely because of the autonomy, independence and opportunities to provide a wider range of patient care,\u201d explains the report."}
