Steve Smith\u201d is still at it. The fake congressman from Georgia\u2019s fictional 15th district continues to pester members of the media on Twitter, trying to ensnare someone into believing he really is the most offensive tea party representative in the House. \u201cSmith\u2019s\u201d first successful target was CNN\u2019s Christiane Amanpour, who replied with \u201cSeriously?\u201d late last month. Now, it appears he may have fooled MSNBC\u2019s Tour\u00e9.\n\nResponding to MSNBC tweet that quoted Tour\u00e9 as saying \u201cObamacare is not Obama\u2019s Katrina,\u201d \u201cSmith\u201d called for the president\u2019s impeachment. When an MSNBC supporter told him to \u201cshut up,\u201d he took things many steps further by using the racially-charged term \u201cboy\u201d in his response\n\nTour\u00e9 responded in what appeared to be genuine outrage to both comments, calling him \u201cCongressman\u201d and questioning his use of the word \u201cboy\u201d:\n\nWithin minutes, after many of his followers pointed out that \u201cSmith\u201d was parody account, Tour\u00e9 acknowledged that he realized it was fake:\n\nBut that wasn\u2019t before frequent MSNBC contributor Ezra Klein retweeted Tour\u00e9\u2019s message to his nearly 400,000 followers. He subsequently acknowledged that it was fake as well:\n\nTwo other MSNBC\u2019ers got roped into the fray as well, with Jonathan Capehart and Sam Stein both calming down their followers who were outraged by \u201cSmith\u2019s\u201d comments:\n\nThe latest uproar has done little to slow down \u201cRep. Steve Smith,\u201d who has kept things going strong on his Twitter account, which is approaching 4,500 followers, into Tuesday afternoon.\n\n[photo via screengrab]\n\n\u2014 \u2014\n\n>> Follow Matt Wilstein (@TheMattWilstein) on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"description": "\"Rep.
