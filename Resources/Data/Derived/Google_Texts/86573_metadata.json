LESTER. >> ALL RIGHT, RON. THANK YOU. AND WHILE THIS LATEST CASE OF EBOLA IS GRABBING ALL THE HEADLINES, HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS ARE WORRIED ABOUT A MUCH MORE COMMON AND DEADLY THREAT. THE FLU. DOCTORS SAY REALITY IS FLU CAN KILL TENS OF THOUSANDS IN THE U.S., NOT EBOLA. BUT THERE ARE WAYS TO PROTECT YOURSELF. NBC'S JOHN YANG HAS OUR STORY TONIGHT. >> ARE YOU HAVING ANY PAIN, SIR? >> Reporter: WHEN DEMETRIUS WALKED IN FEELING ILL, DOCTORS QUICKLY SUSPECTED A VIRUS THAT'S EASILY SPREAD AND IS EXPECTED TO KILL THOUSANDS OF AMERICANS IN THE COMING MONTHS. NOT EBOLA, THE FLU. >> AMERICANS ARE FAR MORE LIKELY TO GET THE FLU THIS YEAR THAN THEY ARE TO GET EBOLA. AND ACTUALLY ARE FAR MORE LIKELY TO DIE FROM THE FLU THIS YEAR THAN TO DIE OF EBOLA. >> Reporter: LIKE EBOLA SEASONAL FLU CAN CAUSE FEVER, HEADACHES AND SOMETIMES VOMITING AND DIARRHEA. BUT UNLIKE EBOLA, THE FLU IS HIGHLY CONTAGIOUS AND IS COMMONLY SPREAD BY COUGHING OR SNEEZING. YOU CAN'T GET EBOLA THROUGH THE AIR. IN THE AKRON AREA TWO PEOPLE ARE QUARANTINED AND 39 OTHERS MONITORED BECAUSE DALLAS NURSE AMBER VINSON, WHO'S NOW FREE OF THE EBOLA VIRUS, VISITED THE AREA BEFORE FALLING ILL. SO FAR ALL HAVE BEEN SYMPTOM FREE. WHAT'S THE LIKELIHOOD THAT YOU'LL SEE AN EBOLA CASE HERE? >> SO WE THINK WE ARE ONE OF THE MOST LIKELY FACILITIES IN THE COUNTRY RIGHT NOW TO GET AN EBOLA CASE, HOWEVER THE LIKELIHOOD IS EXTREMELY LOW. >> Reporter: IT'S A VIRTUAL CERTAINTY THAT THEY'LL SEE FLU CASES THIS WINTER. DOCTORS SAY THERE'S A SIMPLE STEP THAT COULD HELP, GET A FLU SHOT. >> IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO STOP TRANSMISSION UNLESS WE STOP THE INITIAL INFECTION IN THE FIRST PLACE. >> Reporter: THESE CHILDREN ARE DOING SOMETHING THAT FEWER THAN HALF OF ALL ADULTS DO, GETTING VACCINATED AGAINST THE FLU. THE GOVERNMENT ESTIMATES THAT IN AN AVERAGE YEAR THE FLU CLAIMS ABOUT 25,000 LIVES, COSTS $10 BILLION IN HEALTH CARE AND ANOTHER $7 BILLION IN LOST WORK. LAST SEASON THERE WERE 109 CHILD FLU DEATHS, ABOUT 90% OF THEM HADN'T BEEN VACCINATED. TO MAKE IT MORE PALATABLE, THE VACCINE CAN BE DELIVERED BY A NASAL MIST. >> IT'S JUST LIKE WHEN YOU TIP WATER UP YOUR NOSE WHEN YOU GO TO A WATER PARK OR SOMETHING.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Some in the nation are focused on Ebola, but the flu presents a much more immediate threat to the population.", "og": {"site_name": "NBC News", "description": "Some in the nation are focused on Ebola, but the flu presents a much more immediate threat to the population.", "title": "Why the Flu Is Deadlier Than Ebola", "url": "http://www.nbcnews.com/watch/nightly-news/why-the-flu-is-deadlier-than-ebola-347848771830", "image": "http://media2.s-nbcnews.com/i/MSNBC/Components/Video/__NEW/nn_3_ebola_flu_141025.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "NBCNews.com", "description": "Some in the nation are focused on Ebola, but the flu presents a much more immediate threat to the population.", "title": "Why the Flu Is Deadlier Than Ebola", "image": {"src": "http://media2.s-nbcnews.com/i/MSNBC/Components/Video/__NEW/nn_3_ebola_flu_141025.jpg"}, "creator": "NBCNews", "site": "NBCNews", "card": "summary"}, "tp": {"preferredRuntimes": "HTML5", "PreferredFormats": "M3U,F4M,MPEG4"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=319740707, app-argument=http://www.nbcnews.com/watch/nightly-news/why-the-flu-is-deadlier-than-ebola-347848771830", "fb": {"app_id": 10150138890205613}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477afa6914bd0286fe5609\"", "article_summary": "AND ACTUALLY ARE FAR MORE LIKELY TO DIE FROM THE FLU THIS YEAR THAN TO DIE OF EBOLA.\n>> AMERICANS ARE FAR MORE LIKELY TO GET THE FLU THIS YEAR THAN THEY ARE TO GET EBOLA.\n>> Reporter: LIKE EBOLA SEASONAL FLU CAN CAUSE FEVER, HEADACHES AND SOMETIMES VOMITING AND DIARRHEA.\nDOCTORS SAY REALITY IS FLU CAN KILL TENS OF THOUSANDS IN THE U.S., NOT EBOLA.\nBUT UNLIKE EBOLA, THE FLU IS HIGHLY CONTAGIOUS AND IS COMMONLY SPREAD BY COUGHING OR SNEEZING."}
