GOP presidential candidates are looking to cash in on Back to the Future Day, the day Marty McFly and Doc Brown travelled to in "Back to the Future II": Oct. 21, 2015.

Former businesswoman Carly Fiorina and Sen. Marco Rubio Marco RubioSenate GOP ties Iran sanctions fight to defense bill Analysis: Pa. senator missed most Budget Committee hearings Susana Martinez fires back at Trump MORE (R-Fla.) released campaign ads late Tuesday based on the iconic science-fiction comedy film.

Rubio's spot paints Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton and Vice President Biden, who's reportedly nearing a decision on a White House bid, as politicians with outdated ideas.

“In 1989, we went back to the future,” it says, referencing the year the movie was released.

“Now that we’re here, it’s more like blast from the past,” it continues.

Viewers then see retro Clinton and Biden talking points similar to their more-recent public remarks.

“There’s a lot I’d like to do to build on the successes of President Obama,” Clinton says in one segment from this year.

Rubio’s ad then criticizes Clinton for wanting to continue Obama’s policies on tax increases, healthcare, government spending and debt.

“Yesterday is over and we’re never going back,” the spot concludes.

Fiorina's ad, meanwhile, features a voice that sounds like Christopher Lloyd's Doc Brown in her commercial.

“Oct. 21, 2015?” he asks. “Of course, that’s the date people can start changing the future. Do it today, before it’s too late.”

The spot then directs viewers toward a fundraising website for Fiorina’s campaign.

“Doc Brown needs your help to save our future,” it said. “Sign up for future transmissions.”
