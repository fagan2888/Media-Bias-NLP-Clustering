A pair of good-government groups is out with a report digging into the personal finances of New York’s 213 state lawmakers, including a list of the wealthiest.

Topping the list? Assemblywomen Amy Paulin, D-Scarsdale, Westchester County, and Jane Corwin, R-Clarence, Erie County.

Paulin and her husband, real estate investor Ira Schuman, reported a household income of between $2.2 million and $2.6 million in 2012, according to the report issued Tuesday by the New York Public Interest Research Group, Common Cause/NY and The New York World. That was tops among state legislators, besting Corwin’s up to $2 million and Poughkeepsie-area Assemblywoman Didi Barrett, a Democrat who reported as much as $1.8 million in income.

When it comes to total assets, Corwin came out on top, with between $40 million and $74.6 million in assets reported. Paulin was second with between $18.7 million and $34.8 million, according to the report.

The report is based on a set of disclosure forms filed by each lawmaker this year, which were expanded for the first time under a 2011 law requiring lawmakers to disclose more specific information about their outside income. Lawmakers report their income and asset levels within various ranges, accounting for the non-exact figures.

Paulin’s filing, meanwhile, included a number of assets that fell into the highest, uncapped range, according to the report. The report authors estimated Paulin’s total asset worth based on what those with similar incomes reported.

More from the report:





The median lawmaker’s household income was between $137,000 and $172,000, while the median household income in all of New York is $56,951.



The wealthiest legislative conference was the Senate Republicans, with an average household income of $289,332.
