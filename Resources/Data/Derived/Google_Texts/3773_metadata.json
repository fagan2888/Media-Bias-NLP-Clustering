But American drug companies remain by far the most profitable part of the health care sector.\n\nThe drug companies charge so much for these medications for one reason: Because they can.\n\nFunctioning free markets do not \u2014 and never will \u2014 exist in health care because the sellers so often hold all the cards. Unlike someone in the market for a car, a television or a cell phone, people who need a particular medication cannot just decide not to buy a product until the price comes down, or just to do without it altogether. Unless they are interested in dying, or watching a family member die.\n\nCivilized nations \u2014 a term that excludes the United States when discussing health care \u2014 either regulate the prices of drugs or use their concentrated purchasing power to negotiate a reasonable cost. In India, for example, a dose that is identical to what costs more than $90,000 here costs $900.\n\nDrug makers argue that even the staggering cost of Sovaldi or related drugs is a bargain compared to avoided costs of more treatment, surgeries, disability, early death, etc.\n\nBut that doesn't help the uninsured family that can't afford either the drug or the alternative. And it isn't always enough to push insurers to pay up, because Insurance Company A may bear the cost now, only to see the clients move on and endow Insurance Company B \u2014 or Medicaid or Medicare \u2014 with the avoided costs months or years later.\n\nIt is notable that single-payer systems, such as in the United Kingdom, have done the math and agreed to pay high \u2014 though less than in the U.S. \u2014 prices for these drugs. That's because, in those nations, the single payer does, indeed, come out ahead by paying a lot now but saving many multiples of that later.\n\nIn other words, the case made by the drug companies for allowing them to charge such high prices is also an argument for Medicare for all.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Those who continue to argue that there is a \u201cfree market solution\u201d to the unconscionable costs and gaps in the American health care system have to explain away the train wreck surrounding new cures for ...", "copyright": "The Salt Lake Tribune", "author": "The Salt Lake Tribune", "og": {"site_name": "The Salt Lake Tribune", "title": "Editorial: High costs of hepatitis medicine make a good case for universal Medicare", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://www.sltrib.com/csp/mediapool/sites/shared/assets/img/tribune1200x630.jpg", "url": "http://www.sltrib.com/opinion/3738478-155/editorial-high-costs-of-hepatitis-medicine", "article": {"section": "Opinion", "tag": "Care,Case,Com,Cost,Costs,Drug,Health,News,Single,United,"}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Those who continue to argue that there is a \u201cfree market solution\u201d to the unconscionable costs and gaps in the American health care system have to explain away the train wreck surrounding new cures for ...", "title": "Editorial: High costs of hepatitis medicine make a good case for universal Medicare", "url": "http://www.sltrib.com/opinion/3738478-155/editorial-high-costs-of-hepatitis-medicine", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "SL Tribune", "iphone": "The Salt Lake Tribune", "googleplay": "The Salt Lake Tribune"}, "id": {"ipad": "id434734447", "iphone": "id396990949", "googleplay": "com.sltrib.news"}}, "site": "@sltrib", "image": "http://www.sltrib.com/csp/mediapool/sites/shared/assets/img/tribune1200x630.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "index,follow", "GOOGLEBOT": "index,follow", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/saltlaketribune"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Care,Case,Com,Cost,Costs,Drug,Health,News,Single,United,"}, "article_summary": "In other words, the case made by the drug companies for allowing them to charge such high prices is also an argument for Medicare for all.\nFunctioning free markets do not \u2014 and never will \u2014 exist in health care because the sellers so often hold all the cards.\nBut American drug companies remain by far the most profitable part of the health care sector.\nThe drug companies charge so much for these medications for one reason: Because they can.\nIn India, for example, a dose that is identical to what costs more than $90,000 here costs $900."}
