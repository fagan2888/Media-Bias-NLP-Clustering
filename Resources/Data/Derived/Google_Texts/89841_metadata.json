Three years ago, he had all but given up hope.\n\nAt that point, he was 29 years old. Fifteen months had passed since his last U.S. national team appearance. Missing out on South Africa 2010 appeared to be the end.\n\nBut the younger Beckerman had a touch of clairvoyance. Growing up in Anne Arundel County, he would leave notes for his parents to let them know he was out playing soccer \u2014 then tag his signature with \u201cUSA #15.\u201d\n\nSEE ALSO: Spain\u2019s final World Cup tuneup reveals a favorite comfortable in its own style\n\nThe path to making that premonition a reality was longer than expected. Yet in his 15th professional season, Beckerman this week is traveling to Brazil to represent the United States in his first World Cup. Thanks to some late uniform swapping, he\u2019ll do so with No. 15 on his back as well.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really trying to just soak it all in,\u201d Beckerman said recently. \u201cIt really hasn\u2019t totally hit me yet, but each day it\u2019s a little bit more. When I get down to Brazil, that\u2019s when I\u2019ll ultimately feel it.\u201d\n\nAfter starting the Americans\u2019 final exhibition before the World Cup, a 2-1 win over Nigeria on Saturday, Beckerman finds himself contending for a spot in the lineup when the U.S. opens the group stage against Ghana on June 16.\n\nSEE ALSO: Jozy Altidore nets pair to end scoring drought as U.S. heads to World Cup\n\nAs an industrious defensive midfielder, Beckerman rarely steals the headlines. He\u2019s there to stifle opposing attacks and play smart passes. If the 32-year-old goes unnoticed, he\u2019s probably doing his job right. Although he\u2019s known for his long dreadlocks and fondness of reggae music, those attributes belie his in-game ferocity.\n\n\u201cKyle just brings a determination,\u201d U.S. midfielder Brad Davis said. \u201cHe covers so much ground on the field. He\u2019s a difficult guy to play against, a guy who is not going to give up on any tackle or anything whatsoever. The more you play next to him, the more you start to appreciate him.\u201d\n\nA member of the U.S. squad at the 1999 U-17 World Championship, Beckerman spent time at DeMatha Catholic High School in Hyattsville and Arundel High School before entering Major League Soccer in 2000 through the Project-40 youth development program.\n\nYet it wasn\u2019t until 2009 that Beckerman got his first prolonged look from the U.S. national team. Following an extended absence, the Real Salt Lake captain was recalled in August 2011 for coach Jurgen Klinsmann\u2019s first game in charge.\n\nAfter logging five matches in last summer\u2019s Gold Cup, Beckerman started the September win over Mexico that clinched qualification for the World Cup. When Klinsmann named the 23-man roster for Brazil last month, Beckerman made the cut.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a Project-40 player, a youth national team player, a player who has worked incredibly hard on and off the field,\u201d Salt Lake coach Jeff Cassar said. \u201cTo now have success in his later years, it just shows the whole plan of U.S. Soccer is working with investing in young players and getting them experience so they can move on and help the national team. He\u2019s just an inspiration.\u201d\n\nBeckerman\u2019s rise has been emblematic of Klinsmann\u2019s faith in domestic-based veterans. As much as he wants his players to test themselves in the top leagues in Europe, the German soccer legend has kept an open mind toward MLS.\n\nWhile Bob Bradley took just four MLS players to the 2010 World Cup, Klinsmann has picked 10 for this year\u2019s team. And four of them \u2014 including Beckerman and Salt Lake teammate Nick Rimando, the third-string goalkeeper \u2014 are 30-somethings making their World Cup debuts.\n\n\u201cFor Nick and myself, we kind of thought the World Cup dream was done,\u201d Beckerman said. \u201cFor Jurgen to look at MLS and say, \u2018I don\u2019t care where you play, it\u2019s how you\u2019re playing and what you mean to your team,\u2019 it was really cool. Both of us took that opportunity, that door he opened for us, and just ran with it.\u201d\n\nSince joining Salt Lake in a 2007 trade with the Colorado Rapids, Beckerman has been an MLS All-Star every season. Last year, he topped the league in completed passes while leading Salt Lake to the Western Conference title.\n\nConsidering Beckerman\u2019s consistency on the club level, his national team emergence seems like an overdue reward. But as Cassar said, \u201cYou have to have him for a little bit to start to appreciate what he brings to a team.\u201d\n\nNow fans of the U.S. squad understand what those in the Rocky Mountains have known for some time.\n\n\u201cI see it day in, day out, how hard this guy works,\u201d Rimando said. \u201cHe\u2019s our captain [at Salt Lake], and he did not get that role just because of his game. He got that role because he\u2019s a true leader. He\u2019s the first guy on the practice field, the last guy to leave. To see him finally get what he deserves, it\u2019s great.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "As an industrious defensive midfielder, Beckerman rarely steals the headlines.
