RIO GRANDE, Puerto Rico (AP) — Chesson Hadley won the Puerto Rico Open on Sunday for his first PGA Tour victory, holding off Danny Lee by two strokes in wind gusting to 25 mph.

Making his 13th PGA Tour start, the 26-year-old Hadley birdied the final two holes at Trump International for a 5-under 67. He’s the first rookie winner since Jordan Spieth in July in the John Deere Classic.

“I was so nervous,” Hadley said. “I did not eat well last night. I did not eat well this morning.”

Hadley finished at 21-under 267 and earned $630,000, a two-year tour exemption and spots in The Players Championship, PGA Championship and Tournament of Champions. He will move into the mid-60s in the world ranking, giving him a chance to get into the Masters if he can crack the top 50 at the end of the Texas Open.

“It opens up a lot of doors,” Hadley said. “It guarantees me a major. I’ve never played in a major before.”

He birdied three of the first five holes, chipping in on the par-5 fifth.

“It’s all about the start and I got off to a great start,” Hadley said. “Probably the shot that won me the tournament was the chip in on 5. I mean I was dead over there and I hit the nastiest little nipper over there, and it snuck in the left door.”

Lee birdied three of the last four holes for a 68. The South Korean-born New Zealander won the 2008 U.S. Amateur and also has European and Web.com victories.
