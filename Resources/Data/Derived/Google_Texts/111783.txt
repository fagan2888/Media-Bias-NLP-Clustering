Former Massachusetts Labor and Workforce Development Secretary Rachel Kaprielian has found a new job working for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.

Kaprielian will become the regional director for HHS, working with local officials in Massachusetts, Connecticut, Maine, New Hampshire, Rhode Island and Vermont. She will be involved with issues relating to local implementation of the Affordable Care Act and other aspects of federal health care policy.

Kaprielian was appointed secretary of Labor and Workforce Development by former Gov. Deval Patrick in January 2014, after previously working as registrar of the Registry of Motor Vehicles. Cabinet secretaries work at the will of the governor, and Gov. Charlie Baker replaced Kaprielian with Ronald Walker.

Kaprielian was previously active on health care policy as a state representative representing Watertown and Cambridge for 14 years.
