The future of the medicine is a \u201cpit crew\u201d model.That was the message of Atul Gawande, MD, MPH, in his Monday morning keynote at the Medical Group Management Association\u2019s 2015 Annual Conference in Nashville.Gawande, a surgeon at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital in Boston and a popular author and speaker, argued that shared priorities and teamwork are essential in the transition from fee-for-service medicine to value-based, outcome-focused healthcare.\u201cWe\u2019ve built a system that has been around rewarding and making it easier to deliver stuff \u2013 the stuff we discovered in the 20century, pills and procedures,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd [the system has] gotten very good. It\u2019s well designed for delivering pills and procedures. But now we\u2019re trying to do this incredibly hard thing. We\u2019re trying to deliver outcomes.\u201dWhile the scientific advances have given the healthcare industry tremendous capabilities, Gawande said today the barrier to optimal care isn\u2019t so much a lack of specialized knowledge, but rather a failure to bring that knowledge together to form coherent care.\u201cThe reality is that knowledge has exceeded our capabilities as individuals. It\u2019s gotten much more complicated,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd most of the failures are happening in between those great clinicians, those drugs, those devices.\u201dHow can healthcare organizations close the gaps? Gawande said the answers can be surprisingly simple. He said medical teams need to ensure they and their patients are clear about their directions and goals when developing and administering care plans.For example, Gawande\u2019s most recent book, Being Mortal, focuses on palliative care and how physicians communicate with patients who are diagnosed with terminal illnesses. He said doctors often fail to clearly communicate with patients, and physicians aren\u2019t always good at listening. He argues physicians should speak early and deliberately with patients to find out the patient\u2019s priorities, which could range from fighting the disease as long and aggressively as possible to simply wanting to die at home in peace.He joked that there\u2019s a \u201chighly technical\u201d procedure for determining a patient\u2019s priorities: Ask.When it comes to surgery, Gawande said many hospitals have made tremendous strides driving down complications simply by developing a checklist of pertinent information and priorities and having all of the operating room team sit down together to discuss the list prior to surgery.Once the priorities, concerns, and direction are clearly stated, healthcare teams have a better chance of catching problems before they slip through the cracks.While Gawande said the necessary changes are simple conceptually, he said the shift won\u2019t be comfortable for all involved because it will require probing existing habits and re-orienting practitioners to a more team-based approach.\u201cWe\u2019ve spent a good decade kind of pissed off, like, \u2018Who do you think you are, trying to peer into what we\u2019re doing and asking questions?\u2019\u201d he said.However, he said organizations making the evolution are beginning to realize \u201cthat we can\u2019t do it without transparency. We can\u2019t do it without some uncomfortable opening up about how is it you do things\u2026 and what can we do to make that link together a bit better and talk about it?\u201dPhoto by Tim-Llewellyn", "article_metadata": {"description": "The age of the \"cowboy\" specialist is coming to an end.
