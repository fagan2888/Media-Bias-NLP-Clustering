Who is running for election for Congress in the 7th District in Minnesota? Collin Peterson’s name will be on the ballot, but who really is running?

Who brought Obamacare to the district? Collin Peterson voted against it. So who brought it? Nancy Pelosi, that’s who. She’s the person who pushed the bill through the House, and she’s the person who scheduled the vote without anyone knowing what was in it. She worked with Jonathan Gruber, a health care economist who later admitted dishonesty and explained it passed because the American people are stupid.

Is Peterson responsible for that? Yes, because the first vote he cast when he was elected to that Congress was to vote for Nancy Pelosi as speaker. He put her in charge of the machinery of Congress for that result to occur. That’s how Congress works.

Regardless of how Peterson otherwise may vote, a vote for him is a vote for Pelosi and gun control; for Pelosi, Obamacare and poorer medical care; for Pelosi and “transgender” men in women’s bathrooms; for Pelosi and more in-your-face control by the United Nations over our lives; for Pelosi and Planned Parenthood and the aborting of babies; and for Pelosi and the massive tax-and-spend program wrapped around global warming.
