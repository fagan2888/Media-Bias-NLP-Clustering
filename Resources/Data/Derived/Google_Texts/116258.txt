SEATTLE, Oct. 6, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- New Mexico Health Connections (NMHC) has licensed interactive software and evidence-based care guidelines from MCG (part of the Hearst Health network) to help support members with complex care needs.

"With a membership projected to double over the next year, we need to manage risk across our expanding population," said Linda Reiter, NMHC senior director of quality and medical management. "We need an evidence-based solution that supports care of members with complex needs, so we chose MCG CareWebQIÂ® and MCG Chronic Care guidelines."

Created under the Affordable Care Act's Consumer Operated and Oriented Plan (CO-OP), NMHC offers health insurance in the retail market. The CO-OP is physician-led and clinically integrated emphasizing individual attention to members. Its 35,000 members include many individuals new to health insurance as well as small and large employer groups. According to Reiter, the pent-up demand for healthcare has brought to NMHC a high percentage of members with one or more chronic condition.

"We're committed to meeting members where they are," said Reiter. "Whether they have asthma, diabetes, or a combination of chronic conditions, it's crucial to have a solution that creates a coaching plan tailored to the particular member."

NMHC case and disease management teams will use CareWebQI, an interactive care management solution from MCG, to generate individualized care plans based on the Chronic Care guidelines. Chronic Care helps clinicians evaluate needs, identify goals, and support effective self-care for patients with chronic diseases or complex care needs.

"When NMHC began offering healthcare coverage in 2014, they chose to support the community and embrace medical risk instead of running away from it," said Jon Shreve, president of MCG. "Their decision to purchase MCG guidelines and solutions is a testament to the merit of that approach. The NMHC commitment to innovation makes them an excellent partner for MCG."
