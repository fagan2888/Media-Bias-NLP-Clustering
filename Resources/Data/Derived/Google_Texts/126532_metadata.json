UnitedHealth\u2019s rates were set anticipating risk-sharing payments designed to stabilize the new insurance markets, William Golden, the company\u2019s northeast region chief executive officer, said Wednesday at a state Senate round table in Albany. If the loss of a participant reduces the funds available to UnitedHealth, the company\u2019s rates in New York\u2019s Obamacare market may be insufficient, Golden said.\n\n\u201cI have rates that are substantially too low based on risk-adjustment payments not being paid,\u201d he said in the meeting.\n\nOthers in the state\u2019s health insurance industry criticized the Department of Financial Services\u2019 rate-review process as well. Paul Macielak, who runs the New York Health Plan Association, said DFS let Health Republic charge too little for its plans.\n\n\u201cPrior approval is a failed state policy,\u201d Macielak said. \u201cAs it currently exists, it provides the superintendent with unfettered discretion to set rates.\u201d\n\nGenerous Benefits\n\nHealth Republic was charging far less than insurer HealthNow New York Inc., even though its benefits were more generous, HealthNow CEO David Anderson said, adding that regulators should have realized that the company\u2019s collapse was likely.\n\n\u201cTo have rates lower and costs that were higher is not sustainable,\u201d he said at the event. \u201cI don\u2019t think you need to be a Harvard MBA to see that that.\u201d\n\nTroy Oechsner, who helps oversee health insurers at DFS, said the regulator makes sure rates are sound and supported by actuarial calculations. He said actuaries from DFS and Milliman Inc. had examined Health Republic\u2019s rates.\n\n\u201cWe feel strongly that we did the right thing at the time, given the uncertainty of the market,\u201d he said at the event.\n\nRisk-Adjustment Program\n\nUnitedHealth\u2019s Golden said DFS should have approved higher rates for his plans, given that uncertainty. State regulators required that UnitedHealth\u2019s New York rates take into account payments from the law\u2019s risk-adjustment program, Golden said. The program redistributes funds from health insurers who have low-risk, low-cost patients, to those with less healthy, more expensive customers.\n\nThe stabilization payments were thrown into doubt after regulators began shutting down Health Republic Insurance of New York in September because it was likely to become financially insolvent. With its failure, Health Republic won\u2019t be able to pay into the risk-adjustment program, reducing the funds available to UnitedHealth and other plans in the state.\n\n\u201cI would have loved to have sat in a room and said, \u2018What\u2019s your confidence level that these risk-adjustment payments would have been paid?\u2019\u201d Golden said. \u201cIf we would have had that opportunity in July and August, based on the information that Troy just talked about, he would have said, \u2018We\u2019re not as confident as we should be.\u2019\u201d\n\nUnitedHealth fell 1.2 percent to $115.30 at 3:45 p.m. in New York. The stock gained 16 percent last year.\n\nLowered Rate Increase\n\nUnitedHealth requested a 22 percent rate increase for individual Obamacare plans. Instead, state regulators allowed the company to boost rates by 1.65 percent. The company also sells business under the Oxford brand, which requested a 5.32 percent rate increase, and was forced instead to cut rates by 12.25 percent.\n\nThe company has said it should have stayed out of Obamacare\u2019s individual markets until they stabilized. In November, UnitedHealth said it would record hundreds of millions of dollars in losses related to the business.\n\n\u201cIt was for us a bad decision,\u201d CEO Stephen Hemsley said at a December investor meeting in New York. It\u2019s not clear if the potential problems in New York are accounted for in the company\u2019s previously announced anticipated losses.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Zachary Tracer", "twitter": {"url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-01-06/unitedhealth-says-new-york-obamacare-plans-could-be-in-trouble", "description": "UnitedHealth Group Inc., the largest\u00a0U.S. health insurer, said its rates for Obamacare plans in New York may be too low because the failure of a competing insurer last year might lead to shortfalls in payments designed to stabilize Obamacare markets.", "site": "@business", "card": "summary", "title": "UnitedHealth Says N.Y.
