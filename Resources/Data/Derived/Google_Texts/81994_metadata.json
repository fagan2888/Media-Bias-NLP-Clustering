The statement did not specify when the attack occurred.\n\nA convoy of international investigators headed out in the early morning for a visit to the wreckage site of the Boeing 777, but on a road that didn\u2019t go through Shakhtarsk.\n\nA small team managed to perform an initial survey of the area for the first time Thursday. For days, clashes along routes to the wreckage site had kept investigators from reaching the area to find and retrieve bodies that have been decaying in the 90-degree (32 C) midsummer heat. Independent observers warned that there has been tampering with evidence.\n\nThe team was traveling Friday in 15 cars and one bus from their base in the rebel stronghold of Donetsk. Their convoy was joined by three vehicles from the International Committee of the Red Cross when it reached the government-controlled town of Debaltseve.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Ukrainian troops suffer heavy loss in ambush", "author": "MSTYSLAV CHERNOV and Peter Leonard", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Ukrainian troops suffer heavy loss in ambush", "title": "Ukrainian troops suffer heavy loss in ambush", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/08/01/ukrainian_troops_suffer_heavy_loss_in_ambush/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/08/ukraine-.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Ukrainian troops suffer heavy loss in ambush", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/08/ukraine-.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "title": "Ukrainian troops suffer heavy loss in ambush", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Ukrainian troops suffer heavy loss in ambush", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcfe8b\"", "article_summary": "A convoy of international investigators headed out in the early morning for a visit to the wreckage site of the Boeing 777, but on a road that didn\u2019t go through Shakhtarsk.\nTheir convoy was joined by three vehicles from the International Committee of the Red Cross when it reached the government-controlled town of Debaltseve.\nThe team was traveling Friday in 15 cars and one bus from their base in the rebel stronghold of Donetsk.\nA small team managed to perform an initial survey of the area for the first time Thursday.\nFor days, clashes along routes to the wreckage site had kept investigators from reaching the area to find and retrieve bodies that have been decaying in the 90-degree (32 C) midsummer heat."}
