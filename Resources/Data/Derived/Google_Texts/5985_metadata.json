In February the Santa Clara Valley Water District requested that its 1.8 million customers cut their water usage by 20%, however, none of the cities met their goals with Palo Alto and Mountain View coming the closest with a 17 percent reduction each. In January, Governor Jerry Brown declared a draught emergency and issued a statewide request that Californians reduce their water consumption by 20%.\n\nSo far no cities in Northern California have resorted to issuing fines, but water districts are beginning to take the drought more seriously. \u201cWe have a backlog with water wasting complaints,\u201d said Abbey Figueroa a spokesman for the East Bay Municipal Utility District in Oakland. \u201cWe\u2019re getting calls about runoff, broken sprinklers, people washing cars too much.

The news definitely got people\u2019s attention.\u201d\n\nAccording to the News, the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission, the Bay area\u2019s largest water district serving 2.6 million people, plans on dedicating six water cops to look out for water wasters and issue stern warnings. \u201cPenalties are the last resort. But we are definitely keeping that option on the table,\u201d said Steve Ritchie, a representative for the district. \u201cIt\u2019s important that we have that as a tool.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "On Tuesday, a Northern California Water District will vote on whether to spend $500,000 to hire", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "On Tuesday, a Northern California Water District will vote on whether to spend $500,000 to hire", "title": "Drought: 'Water Cops' to Police Water Wasters in Northern California - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Breitbart-California/2014/California/Climate/water-dispensary-ap.jpg", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/california/2014/07/22/draught-water-cops-to-police-water-wasters-in-northern-california/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "On Tuesday, a Northern California Water District will vote on whether to spend $500,000 to hire", "title": "Drought: 'Water Cops' to Police Water Wasters in Northern California - Breitbart", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Breitbart-California/2014/California/Climate/water-dispensary-ap.jpg", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true", "app_id": 1243316582352556}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Drought, Jerry Brown,Breitbart California,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Breitbart California", "tag": "Jerry Brown", "published_time": "2014-07-22T08:40:00-07:00", "categories": "Breitbart California"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc983e\"", "article_summary": "SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERThe water cops would be able to write tickets for water violators if the proposal is approved.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTEROn Tuesday, a Northern California Water District will vote on whether to spend $500,000 to hire \u201cwater Cops\u201d to police Silicon Valley property owners for violating water usage restrictions.\nThe San Jose Mercury News reported that California\u2019s worsening draught conditions are prompting city officials to take more severe steps to discourage wasting water and encourage water conservation.\nThe news definitely got people\u2019s attention.\u201dAccording to the News, the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission, the Bay area\u2019s largest water district serving 2.6 million people, plans on dedicating six water cops to look out for water wasters and issue stern warnings.\n\u201cThe bottom line is that we are just not getting the results we would like to see for water reduction,\u201d asserted Joan Maher, deputy operating officer for the Santa Clara Valley Water District."}
