The metal is among industrial metals that have seen prices rise after China data showed imports slowing. REUTERS/Olivia Harris Olivia Harris/Reuters\n\nIn metals markets long dominated by trends in China\u2019s consumption, a weird new reality is sinking in: Good Chinese economic data is bad and bad actually good for prices.\n\nThe contrast stood out starkly this week. On Monday, prices of industrial metals such as copper and aluminum rose initially after China\u2019s trade data for May showed imports contracted more quickly than the market had expected. On Thursday, meanwhile, prices of several base metals fell sharply even though China\u2019s industrial output growth in May was in line with market expectations.\n\nThe pattern seems to have emerged because \u2018weak\u2019 Chinese economic data encourages hopes the government will introduce more stimulus measures that could stoke metals buying.\n\n\u2018Strong\u2019 data, by contrast, leads to expectations Beijing will stand pat on policy.\n\n\u201cTraders are playing on the expectation of more monetary easing from China when the data is weak,\u201d says Avatar Sandu, Singapore-based head of Commodity Research at Phillip Futures. \u201cThe expectation is that more liquidity in the markets is going to increase consumption.\u201d\n\nFor much of the last decade, prices of most industrial metals have been driven by a boom in China\u2019s consumption to support its phenomenal economic growth. Now, the market is trying to adjust its expectations based on China\u2019s \u201cnew normal\u201d for the economy, analysts say.\n\nEarlier this week, Nomura said in a research report that a steep drop in China\u2019s imports in May showed its demand for commodities is now particularly weak. Partly based on the data, it predicted China would carry out two 25 basis-point interest rate cuts and two more 50 basis-point reserve requirement ratio cuts before the year end.\n\n\u201cWe believe China\u2019s ongoing stimulus policies and monetary easing will support copper demand growth,\u201d said another report from Argonaut Securities.\n\nHowever, hopes of reinvigorated demand were dampened by the relatively strong industrial output data released later in the week on Thursday.\n\nCopper slipped below a psychological threshold of $6,000 a ton on the day.\n\nOf course, not all metals price gyrations are caused by China alone.\n\nSwings in the relative value of the dollar, the currency used for pricing of metals, mine supplies of ores and inventory levels also play a big part metals prices. But even if the market\u2019s reaction to China\u2019s economic data has become more topsy-turvy, it\u2019s clear the country\u2019s influence on prices will remain strong for some time.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "In metals markets long dominated by trends in China's consumption, a weird new reality is sinking in: Good Chinese economic data is bad and bad actually good for prices.", "title": "China\u2019s Good, Bad and Ugly Drive Metals", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2015/06/12/chinas-good-bad-and-ugly-drive-metals/", "image": {"src": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-IU699_0608lm_P_20150608133630.jpg"}, "site": "WSJMoneyBeat", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Markets", "article.headline": "China\u2019s Good, Bad and Ugly Drive Metals", "description": "In metals markets long dominated by trends in China's consumption, a weird new reality is sinking in: Good Chinese economic data is bad and bad actually good for prices.", "article_section": "Markets", "author": "Biman Mukherji", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "MoneyBeat Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "MoneyBeat", "article.summary": "In metals markets long dominated by trends in China's consumption, a weird new reality is sinking in: Good Chinese economic data is bad and bad actually good for prices.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2015-06-12T09:25:28-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-140", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2015/06/12/chinas-good-bad-and-ugly-drive-metals/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-MBB-37932", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Markets", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "In metals markets long dominated by trends in China's consumption, a weird new reality is sinking in: Good Chinese economic data is bad and bad actually good for prices.", "title": "China\u2019s Good, Bad and Ugly Drive Metals", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2015/06/12/chinas-good-bad-and-ugly-drive-metals/", "image": {"width": 749, "identifier": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-IU699_0608lm_P_20150608133630.jpg", "height": 499}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "MoneyBeat", "article.id": "BL-MBB-37932", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2015-06-12T09:27:26-04:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcdca8\"", "article_summary": "REUTERS/Olivia Harris Olivia Harris/ReutersIn metals markets long dominated by trends in China\u2019s consumption, a weird new reality is sinking in: Good Chinese economic data is bad and bad actually good for prices.\nThe metal is among industrial metals that have seen prices rise after China data showed imports slowing.\nSwings in the relative value of the dollar, the currency used for pricing of metals, mine supplies of ores and inventory levels also play a big part metals prices.\nOn Thursday, meanwhile, prices of several base metals fell sharply even though China\u2019s industrial output growth in May was in line with market expectations.\nBut even if the market\u2019s reaction to China\u2019s economic data has become more topsy-turvy, it\u2019s clear the country\u2019s influence on prices will remain strong for some time."}
