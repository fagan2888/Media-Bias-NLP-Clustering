Mr. Viguers took leave to help Justin Wagner, a Hudson Valley Democrat taking on Republican Terrence Murphy in an open race. Both contests are expected to be extremely close and, for different reasons, are very important to Mr. de Blasio.\n\nMr. Lupo and Mr. Viguers join Emma Wolfe, Mr. de Blasio\u2019s intergovernmental affairs director and top operative, on the campaign trail. Ms. Wolfe took leave to assist State Senate Democrats in their effort to put Democrats back in the majority.\n\nA spokesman for Mr. de Blasio confirmed to the Observer that Mr. Viguers and Mr. Lupo took leave from City Hall, but declined to say where.\n\nThe temporary departures of Mr. Lupo, who aided Council Speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito\u2019s campaign for speaker a year ago, and Mr. Viguers do not come as a surprise, though they are unprecedented in recent history. Mr. de Blasio, a former campaign operative, is fully engaged in trying to return Democrats to the majority in the State Senate so he can further his own left-leaning agenda, much of which is dependent on a friendly state legislature. Mr. de Blasio\u2019s two predecessors were both Republicans\u2013Michael Bloomberg never sent aides to help Democrats and used much of his own wealth to prop up Senate Republicans, who have served in the majority for much of the last fifty years.\n\nBut Mr. de Blasio\u2019s assistance does come with risks, observers say. In Mr. Wagner\u2019s race, where a Republican incumbent is leaving office, outside groups are hammering Mr. Wagner for his ties to New York City Democrats and Mr. de Blasio. Mr. Recchia, a former Brooklyn councilman running in a right-leaning Staten Island and Brooklyn-based district, has also been accused of being too beholden to Mr. de Blasio, an increasingly unpopular figure among conservatives.\n\n\u201cDomenic Recchia voted with Bill de Blasio 99 percent of the time, supporting higher taxes and more tolls,\u201d one ad for Mr. Grimm recently proclaimed. \u201cNow Recchia refuses to stand up to de Blasio\u2019s plan to build government housing in our neighborhoods.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.byline_name": "Ross Barkan", "sailthru.author": "Ross Barkan", "application-name": "Observer", "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://nyoobserver.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/102_2165.jpg?quality=80&w=640"}, "site": "@observer", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@Observer"}, "sailthru.article.image.header": "https://nyoobserver.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/102_2165.jpg?quality=80&w=728&h=418&crop=1", "sailthru.tags": "Bill De Blasio, Domenic Recchia, Jon Paul Lupo, jonathan vigeurs, Justin Wagner, Michael Grimm, terrence murphy, obsPolitics", "sailthru.section": "News & Politics", "keywords": "bill de blasio, state senate, jon paul lupo, jonathan viguers, emma wolfe, justin wagner, domenic recchia, michael grimm, hudson valley", "sailthru.article.image.grid": "https://nyoobserver.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/102_2165.jpg?quality=80&w=300&h=225&crop=1", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://observer.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/dac0f3722a48a53be75eb06c0c4f5119?s=16", "news_keywords": "bill de blasio, state senate, jon paul lupo, jonathan viguers, emma wolfe, justin wagner, domenic recchia, michael grimm, hudson valley", "generator": "WordPress.com", "msapplication-TileColor": "#2b5797", "sailthru.title": "Top Bill de Blasio Staffers Take Leave for the Campaign Trail", "sailthru.byline_email": "rbarkan@observer.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "sailthru.byline_slug": "ross", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://nyoobserver.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/102_2165.jpg?quality=80&w=50", "description": "Two top aides to Mayor Bill de Blasio have took leave to help Democrats on the campaign trail.", "sailthru.byline_avatar_url": "https://nyoobserver.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/ross-barkan-headshot-e1402611381985.jpg?quality=80&w=132", "msapplication-tooltip": "News, Politics, Culture, Art, Style, Real Estate, Movie Reviews, TV recaps", "fb": {"app_id": 132947390197809}, "sailthru.byline_twitter": "@rossbarkan", "msapplication-TileImage": "//s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/newyorkobserver-2014/images/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "msvalidate.01": "F8C89E25D5233224541B1BB9B10BF573", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/newyorkobserver", "published_time": "2014-10-23T12:20:11+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-10-29T03:06:56+00:00", "author": "http://observer.com/author/ross"}, "sailthru.description": "Two top aides to Mayor Bill de Blasio have took leave to help Democrats on the campaign trail.", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "og": {"site_name": "Observer", "description": "Two top aides to Mayor Bill de Blasio have took leave to help Democrats on the campaign trail.", "title": "Top Bill de Blasio Staffers Take Leave for the Campaign Trail", "url": "http://observer.com/2014/10/top-bill-de-blasio-staffers-take-leave-for-the-campaign-trail/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "https://nyoobserver.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/102_2165.jpg?quality=80&w=1200", "height": 900}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "146b7f62998343012fae89709f3a8167"}, "sailthru.byline_bio": "Ross Barkan is a national political reporter for The New York Observer.
