He told them they will soon be responsible for their own lives, comparing them to ships in a harbor.\n\nQuoting author John Shedd, he said, \"A ship in harbor is safe, but that is not what ships are built for ... Go out and live life go out and find your life through adventure and discovery.\"\n\nHe also urged the seniors to challenge themselves and the world.\n\n\"I don't want you to leave Fairview and just live,\" he said. \"I want you to live extraordinarily.\"\n\nCalvin Munson, the senior class president, used a chocolate chip cookie and the movie \"Up\" to talk about how they'll soon leave not just Fairview, but their homes and everything they know.\n\n\"Thanks for the adventure,\" he said. \"Now go and have a new one.\"\n\nAmy Bounds: 303-473-1341, boundsa@dailycamera.com or twitter.com/boundsa", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/news/boulder/ci_28182951/fairview-high-graduates-ready-future", "sailthru.author": "By Amy Bounds \n  Staff Writer", "ag": {"canon": "BoulderDailyCamera:article:28182951:view"}, "startDate": "2015-05-24T17:52:58-0600", "twitter": {"domain": "dailycamera.com", "description": "Themes of being true to yourself and living through adventure carried through the speeches at Sunday's Fairview  High graduation ceremony at Broomfield's 1STBANK Center.", "title": "Fairview High graduates ready for future", "url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/news/boulder/ci_28182951/fairview-high-graduates-ready-future", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2015/0524/20150524__25DCAFAIw~2.jpg", "site": "@dailycamera", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "sailthru.section": "Boulder News", "modificationDate": "2015-05-24T23:00:05-0600", "endDate": "2025-05-24T17:51:11-0600", "news_keywords": "Boulder News, Boulder News news, Boulder Colorado Boulder News news, Boulder Colorado news, Boulder News Boulder news, Boulder News Colorado news, US Boulder News news, world Boulder News news.", "byline": "By Amy BoundsStaff", "pubDate": "2015-05-24T17:56:19-0600", "sailthru.date": "2015-05-24T17:52:58-0600", "sailthru.title": "Fairview High graduates ready for future", "verify-v1": "TakAiHiDAOiNOP+m0YTx4DQeyjor+bTdc8e+pw6bDoI=", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2015/0524/20150524__25DCAFAIw~2_300.jpg", "description": "Themes of being true to yourself and living through adventure carried through the speeches at Sunday's Fairview  High graduation ceremony at Broomfield's 1STBANK Center.", "sailthru.site": "dailycamera.com", "msvalidate.01": "9DAB14005AD5A9FFA4CA0EF58CC794BA", "og": {"url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/news/boulder/ci_28182951/fairview-high-graduates-ready-future", "image": "http://extras.dailycamera.com/images/dailycamera3.png", "type": "article", "description": "Themes of being true to yourself and living through adventure carried through the speeches at Sunday's Fairview  High graduation ceremony at Broomfield's 1STBANK Center.", "title": "Fairview High graduates ready for future"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "867892b0357001538903740c75a206f0"}, "google-site-verification": "07CC1xPDVU0znu496XTAjLyC32Ylj8zwWHlmrzx3pgY", "y_key": "c9d9b53f7f5af674", "sailthru.image.full": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2015/0524/20150524__25DCAFAIw~2.jpg"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0a13\"", "article_summary": "Jenna Linsley looks happy with her diploma during the 2015 Fairview High School graduation at the 1STBank Center in Broomfield.\nThemes of being true to yourself and living through adventure carried through the speeches at today's Fairview High graduation ceremony at Broomfield's 1STBANK Center.\nMost Boulder Valley School District students received their diplomas this weekend, while New Vista high School seniors will graduate Saturday.\n(Cliff Grassmick / Staff Photographer)To start the ceremony, graduating senior Sonya Walker played the national anthem on the trumpet, followed by classmate Kaetlyn Arant singing \"Astonishing.\"\nFairview Principal Don Stensrud went with a nautical theme as he gave his last farewell to the class of 2015."}
