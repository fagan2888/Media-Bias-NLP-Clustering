The self-described \u201cI BELIEVE GUY\u201d holds 11 Guinness World Records, including one for \u201cHeaviest Vehicle Lifted with Breath.\u201d Jackson also holds the record for bursting three hot water balloons in a little over a minute. Before you think about trying to break Jackson\u2019s record, he said that five people have lost their lives after their lungs burst from air shooting back down their throat.\n\n\"It can take up to 170 pounds of pressure to blow it up \u2014 like blowing up four car tires,\" Jackson told Entertainment 360 in an interview. \"There's nothing to stop the air from coming back into my lungs.\"\n\nJackson, a Cherokee, Creek, and Seminole Native American, travels the United States as a motivational speaker after years of drug and alcohol abuse. Since starting his tour of America as a clown back in 1992, Jackson claims he has popped over 6,000 hot water bottles. In April 2006, Jackson broke his first Guinness World Record for \u201cFastest Hot Water Bottle Burst\u201d in 51.98 seconds. Fast-forward to April 2009 when he set \u201cFastest time to burse 3 hot water bottles\u201d in one minute, eight seconds.\n\nBack on July 6, 2012, Jackson also went on TruTV\u2019s Guinness World Records Gone Wild where he set yet another record for \u201cMost Hot Water Bottles Blown up in 1 Minute\u201d with five. He has broken his own Guinness World Record for \u201cHeaviest Vehicle Lifted with Breath\u201d two times already, the last time occurring in Beijing, China, where he lifted a 3,352-pound car with only the power of his lungs.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "guinness, world, record, hot, water, bottles", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Man sets Guinness World Record by bursting three hot water bottles in just over a minute, a feat that has already claimed five lives.", "title": "His Lungs Could've Exploded, But He Set The World Record [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/man-sets-guinness-world-record-bursting-3-hot-water-bottles-just-over-minute-thanks-lungs-steel", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/07/29/brian-jackson.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Man sets Guinness World Record by bursting three hot water bottles in just over a minute, a feat that has already claimed five lives.", "title": "His Lungs Could've Exploded, But He Set The World Record [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/man-sets-guinness-world-record-bursting-3-hot-water-bottles-just-over-minute-thanks-lungs-steel", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/07/29/brian-jackson.png", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/07/29/brian-jackson.png"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2014-07-29T12:02:08-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-07-29T12:02:08-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Man sets Guinness World Record by bursting three hot water bottles in just over a minute, a feat that has already claimed five lives."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9c71\"", "article_summary": "In April 2006, Jackson broke his first Guinness World Record for \u201cFastest Hot Water Bottle Burst\u201d in 51.98 seconds.\nFast-forward to April 2009 when he set \u201cFastest time to burse 3 hot water bottles\u201d in one minute, eight seconds.\nSince starting his tour of America as a clown back in 1992, Jackson claims he has popped over 6,000 hot water bottles.\nBack on July 6, 2012, Jackson also went on TruTV\u2019s Guinness World Records Gone Wild where he set yet another record for \u201cMost Hot Water Bottles Blown up in 1 Minute\u201d with five.\nThe self-described \u201cI BELIEVE GUY\u201d holds 11 Guinness World Records, including one for \u201cHeaviest Vehicle Lifted with Breath.\u201d Jackson also holds the record for bursting three hot water balloons in a little over a minute."}
