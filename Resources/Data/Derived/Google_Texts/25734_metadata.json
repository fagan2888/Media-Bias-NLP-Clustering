He has tried to play through it. It hasn\u2019t gotten better at this time of the year.\n\n\u201cInstead of having him go out there and do more damage, it gives us an opportunity to see some of our younger players. But I know our training staff is getting with him, trying to get him right.\u201d\n\nFaried, 26, is averaging 12.9 points and 8.8 rebounds in 61 games (59 starts) this season.\n\nMore pressure, please\n\nDefense was a major problem for the Nuggets through the first three games of this road trip.\n\nOpponents scored at least 116 points, and the Miami Heat put up 124 in the opening game of the trip. Malone hasn\u2019t been pleased with the effort and said the Nuggets must improve their perimeter defense in particular.\n\n\u201cI think to be a good defensive team, it always starts on the ball,\u201d Malone said. \u201cCan you contain the basketball? And that has been an issue.\n\n\u201cWhen you get beat from the 3-point line, it\u2019s because the opposing guards are living in your paint, collapsing your defense and kicking out to wide-open shooters. So, that\u2019s where it always starts \u2014 in transition first and then half court. Can you limit dribble penetration? And if you are able to keep your guards out of the paint, that should allow you to be a much-improved defensive team.\u201d\n\n\n\nRoderick Boone, Special to The Denver Post", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Kenneth Faried on Nuggets\u2019 bench again with sore back", "title": "Kenneth Faried on Nuggets\u2019 bench again with sore back", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/03/19/kenneth-faried-on-nuggets-bench-again-with-sore-back/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160319__514393898p1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160319__514393898p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2016-03-19T21:32:15+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-15T00:45:24+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Coach Michael Malone suggested Faried may be able to return for Monday\u2019s game at Cleveland \u2014 the finale of the Nuggets\u2019 five-game road trip.\nFaried tweaked his back during the third quarter of Tuesday\u2019s game at Orlando and didn\u2019t play Thursday at Atlanta.\nMore pressure, pleaseDefense was a major problem for the Nuggets through the first three games of this road trip.\nCHARLOTTE, N.C. \u2014 Kenneth Faried must wait a little longer before fully returning to action.\nMalone hasn\u2019t been pleased with the effort and said the Nuggets must improve their perimeter defense in particular."}
