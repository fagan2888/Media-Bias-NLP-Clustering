Apart from the appalling human tragedies unfolding daily, it looks as if the greatest casualty of all may be Europe itself.\n\nOn Friday, 40-odd migrants, including 17 children, drowned off the Turkish coast as they headed for the Greek islands. If you barely noticed, you\u2019re among many who have grown inured to such relentlessly grim reports from the Mediterranean.\n\nRelated: End of Europe? Berlin, Brussels' Shock Tactic on Migrants\n\nEach incident is sadder than the last for one simple reason: Europe has yet to come up with a coherent policy providing for (1) safe passage into the European Union, (2) orderly settlement of those who make it, and (3) measures to reduce the flow, if not eliminate it.\n\nGeorge Soros, the politically minded billionaire investor, brought the emerging reality home in an interview with a German business journal earlier this month. \u201cThe E.U. is on the verge of collapse,\u201d Soros observed.\n\nSoros had a lot on his mind\u2014the aftereffects of the Greek crisis, the politics of austerity and its opponents, the threat of a British exit from the E.U., Ukraine and tensions with Russia\u2014but it was the migration flow that produced his pithiest judgment. \u201cWe don\u2019t have a European asylum policy,\u201d he said. \u201cIt has transformed this past year\u2019s growing influx of refugees from a manageable problem into an acute political crisis.\u201d (The New York Review of Books just published an edited version of the interview.)\n\nRelated: European Economy Would Suffer If Free-Travel Zone Collapses\n\nThe core of the problem lies in the divergent interests of E.U. members. Some, notably but not only in eastern and southeastern Europe, are more concerned with saving national borders than with saving lives\u2014to say nothing of the humanitarian principles that are supposed to bind European culture into one.\n\nIn consequence, E.U. leaders flail in their search for a solution at this point. The day of the latest tragedy at sea, the Financial Times reported from Brussels that they are privately considering \u201cring-fencing Greece\u201d at its northern border to block the flow of migrants into Macedonia and onward into Western Europe.\n\nThis is desperation. It would trap tens of thousands of migrants\u2014turning Greece into \u201ca black box,\u201d as Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras put it last weekend. Although Macedonia isn\u2019t an E.U. member, the move would also deal a huge blow to the union\u2019s open-borders principle as embodied in its Schengen policy.\n\nThe threats to Europe can now be divided into two, one among its ranks and the other on its eastern flank. The first is more formidable, but it\u2019s a marginal call: They\u2019re both huge and serious.\n\nRelated: Arrests, Security Fears Dampen New Year Spirit in Europe\n\nA current of xenophobia and rightwing nationalism has gathered strength across Europe for many months. Its most notable manifestation came last September, when Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n presented a radical six-point plan to fortify Europe\u2019s borders in defense of \u201cChristian culture.\u201d\n\nNow comes a bigger threat. Following the sexual assaults in Cologne on New Year\u2019s weekend, conservative MPs in Angela Merkel\u2019s Christian Democratic Union are breaking into open revolt against the German chancellor\u2019s courageously humanitarian policy on the migrant question.\n\nDespite domestic resistance, more than a million migrants passed through Merkel\u2019s open door last year. If she is forced to accede to the demands of CDU rebels\u2014full border controls, almost all refugees barred\u2014Schengen will be curtains and the E.U. will lose its wisest leader on the migrant crisis and probably its direction.\n\nEurope\u2019s other problem, ever more evident, is Turkey. It\u2019s now plain that its effort to recruit the Ankara government as a lynchpin ally in stanching the flow of migrants into Europe has been completely ineffective.\n\nRelated: Fear and Few Answers as Turkish Police Round Up Syrian Refugees\n\nThis is the reality behind the nonsensical talk last week of fortifying Greece\u2019s border with Macedonia. In effect, such a policy would move the front line in the migrant crisis from Turkey\u2019s coast westward to Greece\u2019s northern frontier.\n\nIt\u2019s an admission of failure: Recip Tayyid Erdo\u011fan, Turkey\u2019s president, has proven more or less a deadbeat since the Europeans, in a pact signed last November, committed to giving Turkey $3.3 billion in refugee-related assistance.\n\nAfter the injury comes the insult. Over the weekend, Turkish Premier\n\nAhmet Davuto\u011flu announced on arriving in Berlin for talks with Merkel that the Erdo\u011fan government now insists on yet more money.\n\nRelated: No Drop in Asylum Seekers Reaching Germany, Berlin Says\n\n\u201cThe \u20ac3 billion is just to show the political will to share the burden,\u201d Davuto\u011flu said in an interview with DPA, the German press agency. \u201cWe will review it again and again\u2026 and we are not begging for money from the E.U. But if there is a serious will to share the burden, than we will have to sit and talk about all of the details of the crisis.\u201d\n\nOne could call this a shakedown in broad daylight, but that\u2019s not polite. Let\u2019s just say (1) it isn\u2019t an accurate account of what was agreed in November, (2) it is highly doubtful the E.U. spent \u20ac3 billion \u201cjust to show political will,\u201d and (3) Merkel is possessed of an awesome patience.\n\nAs background here, there is formidable evidence that members of the Erdo\u011fan government may be profiting from the Islamic State\u2019s illicit oil trade. My sources in Europe and Turkey tell me there are indications Turkish officials may also be taking a cut from migrant traffickers.\n\nThese reports bear investigation. If there\u2019s a question of \u201cserious will\u201d at issue, as Davuto\u011flu suggested, it\u2019s more likely to lie with Turkey than the E.U.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "It\u2019s now nearly a year since waves of migrants from the Middle East, North Africa, and", "title": "One Year Later, Europe\u2019s Migrant Crisis Could Sink the EU", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2016/01/25/One-Year-Later-Europe-s-Migrant-Crisis-Could-Sink-EU", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/06142013_Eurozone_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2016/01/25/One-Year-Later-Europe-s-Migrant-Crisis-Could-Sink-EU", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/06142013_Eurozone_article.jpg", "creator": "@psmith7600", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "It\u2019s now nearly a year since waves of migrants from the Middle East, North Africa, and", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "will lose its wisest leader on the migrant crisis and probably its direction.\nIn effect, such a policy would move the front line in the migrant crisis from Turkey\u2019s coast westward to Greece\u2019s northern frontier.\nMy sources in Europe and Turkey tell me there are indications Turkish officials may also be taking a cut from migrant traffickers.\nRelated: European Economy Would Suffer If Free-Travel Zone CollapsesThe core of the problem lies in the divergent interests of E.U.\nIf there\u2019s a question of \u201cserious will\u201d at issue, as Davuto\u011flu suggested, it\u2019s more likely to lie with Turkey than the E.U."}
