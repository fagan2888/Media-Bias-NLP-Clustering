But the smaller crowds could also reflect deeper changes in how Americans shop: Increasingly, they are spending more online and making fewer visits to stores.\n\nFor the first time, Walmart made the majority of its Black Friday deals available online in the wee hours of Thanksgiving morning \u2014 some 15 hours before its stores opened.\n\nRetailers have historically used deep discounts on a limited supply of big-ticket items to lure shoppers to their physical stores, thus the name \u201cdoor-buster.\u201d Instead of lining up outside stores for hours to get those deals, Walmart shoppers this year were able to purchase items such as a $125 Roku 32-inch TV from the comfort of their homes.\n\nSo many shoppers visited Walmart\u2019s website when the door-busters went on sale early Thursday that the site was overloaded and some shoppers struggled to check out.\n\nAnalysts interpreted the move by Walmart and other maneuvers by Target and J.C. Penney as attempts to win shoppers back from Amazon.com, whose product discounts and shipping promotions are eating away at retail profits.\n\nShoppers didn\u2019t wait for Black Friday to spend. E-commerce sales were up 51 percent by midday Thursday, compared with the same period a year ago, according to ChannelAdvisor, an e-commerce software company. Amazon.com\u2018s sales rose 31 percent, eBay increased 11 percent and Google Shopping was up nearly 60 percent.\n\nAdobe, which tracked transactions from 4,500 retail websites, estimated consumers will have spent $2.72 billion online Friday, after spending $1.73 billion on Thanksgiving.\n\nU.S. online retail sales during the holiday season are expected to total $95.5 billion, an 11 percent increase over last year, according to Forrester. By contrast, the National Retail Federation expects total holiday retail sales, including in store and online, to grow 3.7 percent.\n\nHeading into the weekend, the NRF predicted that 135.8 million people would shop over the Thanksgiving weekend, a slight increase over the 133.7 million who did so in 2014. Any growth would be a reversal from last year, when retail spending over the Thanksgiving weekend fell 11 percent.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Online spending up as brick-and-mortar crowds thin for Black Friday", "title": "Online spending up as brick-and-mortar crowds thin for Black Friday", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/11/27/online-spending-up-as-brick-and-mortar-crowds-thin-for-black-friday/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151127__BN20151128_Z00_BNBZ28BLACKFRIDAY1p3.jpg", "height": 418}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151127__BN20151128_Z00_BNBZ28BLACKFRIDAY1p3.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-11-27T17:35:10+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-20T04:05:50+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Personal finance"}, "article_summary": "Any growth would be a reversal from last year, when retail spending over the Thanksgiving weekend fell 11 percent.\nU.S. online retail sales during the holiday season are expected to total $95.5 billion, an 11 percent increase over last year, according to Forrester.\nBy contrast, the National Retail Federation expects total holiday retail sales, including in store and online, to grow 3.7 percent.\nBut the smaller crowds could also reflect deeper changes in how Americans shop: Increasingly, they are spending more online and making fewer visits to stores.\nHeading into the weekend, the NRF predicted that 135.8 million people would shop over the Thanksgiving weekend, a slight increase over the 133.7 million who did so in 2014."}
