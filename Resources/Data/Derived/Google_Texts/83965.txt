Greater New York starts the week on a sunny note, with several days of nice weather in the forecast before clouds and showers return on Thursday.

High pressure makes an appearance over the tri-state area on Sunday night and stays in control through the middle of the week. This results in Monday’s high temperatures staying right around normal, holding steady in the lower 80s under bright skies, making this a good day for the beach and other outdoor activities. Clouds may start to move in during the late afternoon and evening, but this activity will not lead to any sort of significant cloud cover. Overnight lows should stay seasonable as well, ranging from the upper 60s in New York City to right around 60 degrees in Orange County, N.Y.

The sun will shine again on Tuesday and Wednesday, accompanied by light winds and highs in the lower 80s. With August more than half over, there’s still no sign of the heat that tends to pervade the region at this time of year. Mid-August highs are usually in the lower and middle 80s; temperatures are expected to remain at or slightly below normal this week, with highs in the upper 70s and lower 80s. But, the long-range forecast indicates that the last week of August may feature a few days of highs in the upper 80s and possibly the low 90s.
