The move is allowed under a policy change announced last week by President Barack Obama.\n\nBut the state's announcement, backed by Gov. Rick Snyder, is essentially meaningless to thousands of members of Blue Cross, the state's largest insurer with a majority of the individual market. On Friday the company said it will continue transitioning members into plans that comply with the Affordable Care Act for 2014.\n\nThere is one exception: A pre-Obamacare plan called \u201cKeep Fit\u201d will still be offered for 2014 to customers, since the plan's renewal date comes before Jan. 1, 2014. That was already an option before the state made its announcement Friday.\n\n\u201cAs Blue Cross discontinues our non-compliant health plans, we will be transitioning those members in Keep Fit to make sure their coverage continues,\u201d said company spokesman Andy Hetzel.\n\nAt least 225,000 Michiganders were among millions of people nationwide who buy their own insurance and had received discontinuation notices from various insurers, according to a count by the Associated Press.\n\nBlue Cross has about 175,000 members in the individual market, including about 35,000 who were in the Keep Fit plan for 2013. It sent letters to the remaining 140,000 members notifying them that their current plans would be discontinued in 2014. In many cases new options that include additional benefits are significantly more expensive than their existing plans.\n\nSo far an additional 12,400 members have chosen Keep Fit, for a total of 47,400. The company is receiving calls and interest in the product daily, according to Terry Burke, vice president for individual business. People who aren't currently Blue Cross members have until Dec. 1 to enroll in Keep Fit, while current members have until Dec.12.\n\nRelated: Blue Cross, Priority Health talk Obamacare changes\n\nSince Blue Cross spent the past few years planning to discontinue its non-compliant individual plans, it hasn't increased rates since 2011. If it did extend those policies another year, it would raise rates by 30 percent or more to catch up.\n\nWhile the Keep Fit premium won't change, customers will pay more next year to cover taxes and fees associated with the Affordable Care Act.\n\nBlue Cross would prefer its members enroll in Obamacare-compliant plans, which offer more benefits and come with the possibility of tax credits, Hetzel said.\n\n\u201cWe are not encouraging people to take a backwards step,\u201d he said, noting that the new plans \u201care good for the future.\u201d\n\nEmail Melissa Anders at manders@mlive.com.
