The Red Raiders went from a 14-13 lead to a 49-13 edge thanks to five touchdowns in a span starting at the 6:08 mark of the second quarter and finishing at the 4:48 mark of the third quarter.\n\nDifference maker: Malik Freeman\u2019s ability to make plays with his hands and feet proved to be critical for Madison County. He pulled down a pair of jump balls for touchdown receptions early, then broke free for a 23-yard touchdown run late in the first half. Freeman had 125 total yards (67 receiving, 58 rushing).\n\nA special teams breakdown and a lost fumble Friday turned the tide quickly against North Hall.\n\nFor nearly a quarter and a half, the winless Trojans (0-7, 0-4 Region 8-AAAA) were playing pretty much even with Madison County. But RaShawn Gresham\u2019s 95-yard kickoff return touchdown and a lost fumble that led to another score put North Hall in a 28-13 hole by halftime en route to a 49-20 loss at The Brickyard.\n\n\u201cWe felt all week we had a really good chance as long as we stayed mentally focused, which has been a struggle from time to time,\u201d said first-year North Hall head coach David Bishop. \u201cWe came out trading scores with them and looking about as sharp as we\u2019ve looked all year. When you\u2019re inexperienced, sometimes it takes one little mistake.\u201d\n\nThe defeat ended North Hall\u2019s playoff hopes in Region 8-AAAA while keeping the Red Raiders squarely in contention for the second playoff seed from the region as they surpassed their 2013 win total.\n\nThe game-changing sequence began after Maddox Turner\u2019s 31-yard touchdown run cut the Trojans\u2019 deficit to 14-13 with 6:21.3 remaining in the second quarter and the Red Raiders (5-2, 3-1) partially blocked the extra point to maintain their edge.\n\nFollowing Gresham\u2019s score on the ensuing kickoff, a fumble recovery by Madison County\u2019s Beau Gentry at the North Hall 49 set up a Malik Freeman 23-yard touchdown run 11 plays later. That made it 28-13 with 1:13.4 to go in the half.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re moving the ball down the field, and when we fumble and turn it over, it just seemed like it changed the whole emotion of the team,\u201d Bishop said. \u201cIt changed the whole focus of the team, and from that point forward, we just never looked the same again.\u201d\n\nNorth Hall\u2019s defensive stop on a fake field goal in the final moments of the first half kept the game from getting away momentarily.\n\nFreeman had touchdown catches of 24 and 32 yards from Ethan South prior to his running score, with Drew Atha finding the end zone on a 1-yard first-quarter run for North Hall.\n\nBoth of Freeman\u2019s touchdown grabs came on jump balls, the second against double coverage.\n\nA 24-yard scoring run by South, a 4-yarder by K.J. Burton the play after an errant Trojan snap on a punt attempt and a 34-yard touchdown run from Gresham in the first eight minutes of the third quarter broke the game open by pushing it to 49-13.\n\n\u201cMadison probably doesn\u2019t get near as much credit as they deserve,\u201d Bishop said. \u201cThey\u2019re a very talented football team. We told our kids, \u2018You make a mistake, you\u2019re going to pay for it because they\u2019ve got so much talent.\u2019\u201d\n\nKyle Bacus added a 2-yard touchdown run for North Hall with 3:59.3 left in the contest.\n\n\u201cThe only thing that has made us successful over the years is the ability to continue to fight,\u201d Bishop said. \u201cAnd right now, we\u2019ve got to learn that and continue to be able to do that Monday through Friday.\u201d\n\nFreeman finished with three receptions for 67 yards and seven carries for 58 yards. Gresham totaled 60 yards on seven carries.\n\n\u201cWe made so many mental mistakes,\u201d Bishop said. \u201cAnd it became back-to-back-to-back. And you just can\u2019t win football games that way.\u201d\n\nTurner paced the Trojans with 86 yards on 12 carries, including 49 yards on a trio of runs on the drive he capped with a touchdown.\n\nMadison County finished with 393 total yards, including 273 rushing yards on 45 carries.\n\nNorth Hall tallied 215 of its 255 total yards on the ground.\n\nBobby Mendenhall paced the Trojans defense with nine tackles (six solo), with Sam Jackson tallying eight tackles (all solo).\n\nNorth Hall hosts winless Monroe Area next week, and Madison County welcomes Stephens County.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.gainesvilletimes.com/archives/105317/", "image": "http://media.morristechnology.com/webmedia/upload/gainesville/article/2014/10/17/1017NORTH_0005_.JPG", "type": "article", "description": "A special teams breakdown and a lost fumble Friday turned the tide quickly against North Hall.", "title": "Key plays go against Trojans in 49-20 loss to Madison County"}, "twitter": {"site": "@gtimes", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive", "title": "Key plays go against Trojans in 49-20 loss to Madison County"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1262\"", "article_summary": "Difference maker: Malik Freeman\u2019s ability to make plays with his hands and feet proved to be critical for Madison County.\nNorth Hall hosts winless Monroe Area next week, and Madison County welcomes Stephens County.\nFor nearly a quarter and a half, the winless Trojans (0-7, 0-4 Region 8-AAAA) were playing pretty much even with Madison County.\nWho\u2019s next: North Hall (0-7, 0-4 Region 8-AAAA) hosts winless Monroe Area next Friday, while Madison County (5-2, 3-1) welcomes Stephens County, which is 4-0 in region play.\nMadison County finished with 393 total yards, including 273 rushing yards on 45 carries."}
