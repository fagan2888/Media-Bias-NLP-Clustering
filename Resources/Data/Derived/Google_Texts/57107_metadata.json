When he left jail, however, he\u2019d only get standard three months\u2019 supply of medication, prompting him to start the cycle of crime all over again.\n\nHaving spent nearly half his life in jail or prison, Sanchez is now in the process of signing up through CountyCare with the help of Thresholds, a mental health services provider he found through his probation officer. \u201cThen I ain\u2019t got to worry about going to jail to get my medicine,\u201d says Sanchez, who\u2019s never had health insurance as an adult.\n\nRELATED: Jails are signing up inmates for Obamacare\n\nChicago\u2019s Cook County was one of the first places in the country to enroll residents in the Medicaid expansion through the criminal justice system. It\u2019s now joined by counties in California, Connecticut, Oregon, and other states that have chosen to expand Medicaid through Obamacare.\n\nNatrik Washington, who got out of Cook County Jail in late 2013, has reaped some of the benefits of being insured. Washington, 43, was hospitalized after his last stay time in jail for a suicide attempt and enrolled in Illinois\u2019s Medicaid expansion last year.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing worse than not being able to get the medication you need,\u201d he said.\n\nWashington, who said he\u2019s been chronically homeless since 2003, had stolen some Tylenol and deodorant from Walgreen\u2019s to sell in order to fund his heroin and cocaine habit. Now he says he\u2019s been sober for a year\u2014the longest time he\u2019s been clean in more than a decade\u2014and can pick up his anti-depressants at an ordinary pharmacy.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m feeling a little better mentally, so I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll relapse and have another suicide attempt now. I feel a little stronger mentally since I don\u2019t get high. I\u2019m learning to be patient,\u201d says Washington, who now sees a psychiatrist regularly and goes to group counseling sessions at Heartland Health Outreach, which serves low-income and homeless residents in Chicago.\n\nCarlos Javier Ortiz is a documentary photographer based in Chicago.
