The Netherlands, Sweden and Norway were also near the top. The U.S. clocked in near the middle in reading and near the bottom in math. Spain, Italy and France were at near the bottom in both reading and math.\n\n\u201cThe first question these kinds of studies raise is, \u2018If we\u2019re so dumb, why are we so rich?\u2019\u201d the Times quotes Anthony P. Carnevale of Georgetown University as saying.\n\nBut what the study really finds isn\u2019t just that Americans are dumb, but that we have a few very skilled people way at the top of the pyramid, and a large base ranking way at the bottom in skills. \u201cThe American results were among the most polarized between high achievement and low,\u201d writes the Times.\n\nRemind you of anything else? Polarization between high and low is roughly a model for the structure of American society writ large. Whether it\u2019s education, our economic structure, or the way we think about healthcare, you see this pattern everywhere. How common is it for someone to say, \u201cWell we may not insure everyone in this country, but our hospitals are the most sophisticated in the world\u201d? Similarly, America is only a \u201crich country\u201d when you look at the aggregate funds hoarded stateside. We look rich because our outliers are so rich they bring the average up, but the tiniest percentage of our country controls all that wealth. The vast majority of America is not exceedingly wealthy.\n\nObamacare is essentially an attempt to reorient the healthcare system from one of extreme polarization between the haves and the have-nots to a more even-tempered system that benefits a larger portion of the whole. Sounds like we could use a similar overhaul in our education system.", "article_metadata": {"description": "\u201cThe first question these kinds of studies raise is, \u2018If we\u2019re so dumb, why are we so rich?\u2019\u201d", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Death and Taxes", "description": "\u201cThe first question these kinds of studies raise is, \u2018If we\u2019re so dumb, why are we so rich?\u2019\u201d", "title": "Are Americans actually wicked stupid?", "url": "http://www.deathandtaxesmag.com/207322/are-americans-actually-wicked-stupid/", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://static.deathandtaxesmag.com/uploads/2013/10/Screen-Shot-2013-10-08-at-12.57.15-PM.png", "height": 412}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "\u201cThe first question these kinds of studies raise is, \u2018If we\u2019re so dumb, why are we so rich?\u2019\u201d", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 119986914707220}, "keywords": "study american education,study americans falling behind,study americans lacking in skills,news", "article": {"published_time": "2013-10-08T16:33:29Z", "modified_time": "2013-10-08T16:33:29Z"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb61f\"", "article_summary": "Similarly, America is only a \u201crich country\u201d when you look at the aggregate funds hoarded stateside.\nOf 23 countries Japan ranked first and Finland second on reading and math skills.\nThe U.S. clocked in near the middle in reading and near the bottom in math.\n\u201cEven middle-aged Americans \u2014 who, on paper, are among the best-educated people of their generation anywhere in the world \u2014 are barely better than middle of the pack in skills,\u201d reports the Times.\nSpain, Italy and France were at near the bottom in both reading and math."}
