The problem it addresses is that many commuters from places like SeaTac, an outlying suburb, are too poor to live in Seattle, where prices and rents are soaring in a technology-driven boom. If they are pushed out so far that they cannot afford to get to work or give up on doing so, backers of the project said, Seattle\u2019s economy could choke.\n\n\u201cI would characterize this as a safety valve,\u201d said Dow Constantine, the King County executive and chairman of Sound Transit, a transportation agency serving multiple counties in the region. From 1999 to 2012, Mr. Constantine said, 95 percent of the new households in King County have been either rich or poor, earning more than $125,000 a year or less than $33,000, with hardly anything in between.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s people doing really well, and people making espresso for people who are doing really well,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAt 12:01 a.m. on Sunday, buses, trains and passenger ferries in the county began charging only $1.50 per ride \u2014 more than 50 percent off peak fares \u2014 to riders like Basro Jama, who lives in Tukwila, just south of Seattle.\n\nMs. Jama, 27, an immigrant from Somalia who is raising two young children by herself, earns less than $25,000 a year after taxes from her full-time job cleaning office buildings in downtown Seattle at night. She enrolled last week in the first wave of sign-ups for the ORCA Lift reduced-fare program, which transit administrators said could reach perhaps 100,000 people. (ORCA, or \u201cone regional card for all,\u201d is King County Metro Transit\u2019s name for its fare card.)\n\nPhoto\n\nORCA Lift is run by King County Metro Transit, but the discount will apply to all passenger public transit in the county, including that of other agencies, like Sound Transit.\n\nThe program hinges on smart-card technology, an aggressive outreach effort by King County officials to people like Ms. Jama, and a liberal political establishment that believes the region\u2019s economy is unbalanced and vulnerable in its growing divisions of poverty and wealth. Politicians and voters have raised the minimum wage based on that argument, with an increase to $15 an hour, more than twice the federal level, approved by voters in SeaTac in 2013 and by the Seattle City Council in 2014.\n\nThe reality of public transportation in America is that almost all of it is heavily subsidized by government, no matter how rich or poor the riders are. And those budgets, not least in Seattle, have been under severe stress. More than 70 percent of the nation\u2019s transit systems cut service, raised fares or both during the recession and its aftermath, according to the American Public Transportation Association, a trade group. King County Metro Transit has raised fares six times since 2008, including an increase of 25 cents that kicks in on Sunday.\n\nBut income-based pricing is logistically complicated, which is partly why it has rarely been tried on any large scale, transportation experts said. San Francisco, which many in Seattle see as a kind of big brother to the south \u2014 sometimes to be emulated, other times to be scorned \u2014 got there first with a fare program called Muni Lifeline, which started in 2005. But after 10 years, Muni Lifeline remains tiny, with fewer than 20,000 card holders in a system that serves about 350,000 people a day.\n\nSmaller, tentative experiments are underway elsewhere. Greene County, Ohio, near Dayton, recently started a program for low-income riders, with social service agencies buying travel vouchers and distributing them to their clients. In other places, like western Pennsylvania, nonprofit groups have jumped in to provide bus service to the poor.\n\nBut at least for the moment, all eyes are on Seattle, transportation experts said.\n\n\u201cWhat Seattle has done is what others might consider,\u201d said Art Guzzetti, vice president for policy at the American Public Transportation Association. \u201cEveryone is watching.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nThe distinctions start with scale and ambition: King County has about two and a half times San Francisco\u2019s population, and in aiming for enrollment numbers San Franciscans could only dream of, it is relying on what transit experts say is the most innovative idea of all: tools honed by the Affordable Care Act. A countywide system of more than 40 health clinics, food banks, community colleges and other sites run by nonprofit groups was put together to enroll residents in health insurance, and those partners were re-enlisted in the last few weeks to start registering people for ORCA Lift.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThat is how Ms. Jama got her little blue card. She went to a health clinic here in SeaTac on Tuesday morning to have a doctor look at one of her children. While she was there, a worker for a nonprofit called Global to Local \u2014 a member of the ORCA Lift team tasked with connecting residents to health and social services from a kiosk in the lobby \u2014 asked Ms. Jama if, by chance, she was a transit rider.\n\nMs. Jama said yes. She also happened to have a recent pay stub in her pocket, verifying her income. Fifteen minutes later, she had the card in her hand.\n\nThough it works like a regular transit pass, the card will remove only $1.50 for a fare. It is good for two years without the need for users to reconfirm their income. County officials said they did not anticipate big wage increases.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the trick in it?\u201d Ms. Jama asked softly, glancing down at the card and up at Amy Samudre, the program manager at Global to Local who had processed her application.\n\n\u201cNo trick,\u201d Ms. Samudre replied with a little shrug.\n\nThe discount ORCA Lift provides might sound trivial to some, but for Ms. Jama, it is clearly not. The $10 or more a week that she will save on commuting represents a raise of almost 2.5 percent in her take-home pay. She said she might use the money for a special treat.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s like taking my kids to McDonald\u2019s,\u201d she said. \u201cTwo Happy Meals is $9.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20150228164620, "twitter": {"description": "A new project in Seattle, closely watched around the nation, gives discounts on public transit to people whose household income is no more than two times the federal poverty level.", "title": "Targeting Inequality, This Time on Public Transit", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/01/us/targeting-inequality-this-time-on-public-transit.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003542596"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "creator": "kljohnso", "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/03/01/us/01transit-02/01transit-02-thumbLarge-v2.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/01/us/targeting-inequality-this-time-on-public-transit.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003542596", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/01/us/targeting-inequality-this-time-on-public-transit.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "us", "channels": "NytNow", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/us/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "Feb. 28, 2015", "edt": "NewYork", "keywords": "Seattle (Wash),Transit Systems,Commuting,Income Inequality,Prices (Fares  Fees and Rates)", "news_keywords": "Commuting", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Kirk Johnson", "thumbnail_150": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/03/01/us/01transit-02/01transit-02-thumbLarge-v2.jpg", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "thumbnail_150_width": 150, "byl": "By KIRK JOHNSON", "thumbnail_150_height": 150, "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "A new project in Seattle, closely watched around the nation, gives discounts on public transit to people whose household income is no more than two times the federal poverty level.", "tom": "News", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/03/01/us/01transit-02/01transit-02-thumbStandard-v2.jpg", "description": "A new project in Seattle, closely watched around the nation, gives discounts on public transit to people whose household income is no more than two times the federal poverty level.", "CG": "us", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "Feb. 28, 2015", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "News", "article": {"author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/j/kirk_johnson/index.html", "section_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/pages/national/index.html", "section": "U.S.", "modified": "2015-03-03", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/us/index.jsonp", "tag": "Prices (Fares, Fees and Rates)", "published": "2015-02-28", "section-taxonomy-id": "23FD6C8B-62D5-4CEA-A331-6C2A9A1223BE"}, "thumbnail_height": 75, "geo": "Seattle (Wash)", "slug": "01transit", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20150303181217, "hdl_p": "Targeting Inequality, This Time on Public Transit", "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/01/us/targeting-inequality-this-time-on-public-transit.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/03/01/us/01transit-02/01transit-02-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "A new project in Seattle, closely watched around the nation, gives discounts on public transit to people whose household income is no more than two times the federal poverty level.", "title": "Targeting Inequality, This Time on Public Transit"}, "pdate": 20150228, "des": "Prices (Fares, Fees and Rates)", "articleid": 100000003542596, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "Targeting Inequality, This Time on Public Transit", "PST": "News"}, "article_summary": "PhotoORCA Lift is run by King County Metro Transit, but the discount will apply to all passenger public transit in the county, including that of other agencies, like Sound Transit.\nKing County Metro Transit has raised fares six times since 2008, including an increase of 25 cents that kicks in on Sunday.\nThe reality of public transportation in America is that almost all of it is heavily subsidized by government, no matter how rich or poor the riders are.\nThe discount ORCA Lift provides might sound trivial to some, but for Ms. Jama, it is clearly not.\n\u201cWhat Seattle has done is what others might consider,\u201d said Art Guzzetti, vice president for policy at the American Public Transportation Association."}
