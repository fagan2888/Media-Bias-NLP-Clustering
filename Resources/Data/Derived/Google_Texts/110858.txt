It is with great sadness that we report that Austin Hill, one of Townhall’s longtime columnists, passed away unexpectedly on Friday evening.

As faithful readers know, Hill brought a wealth of knowledge and passion to his work, which focused on small business ownership, economics, and entrepreneurship. Beyond his role as columnist, Hill was an accomplished author, consultant, small business owner, and a popular syndicated radio show host.

According to a statement from the Hill family, doctors believe the cause of his death was a pulmonary embolism.

“As a follower of Jesus, Austin's faith permeated and influenced all aspects of his life,” a statement from the family said. “He was committed to speaking the truth and engaging people in thoughtful conversation. In addition to writing and public speaking, Austin had a national radio presence with dedicated listeners across the country. Most importantly, he was a loving husband, and as his son describes him, an avid father.”

The family has asked that in honor of Austin, consider making a donation to a college fund for his son, who’s a senior in high school.

“It was very important to Austin that his passion for learning and critical thinking be passed on to his son, Graham,” the statement read. “Austin wanted to provide him with an opportunity to attend college and have every opportunity to develop his many skills and reach his full potential.”

Please keep the Hill family in your prayers.
