In Sunnyside and Woodside, where insurance stats are the worst, 57% of the population is foreign-born.\n\nIn addition, some young people have opted not to pay for insurance they don\u2019t think they need.\n\n\u201cThese are populations that we have to do a better job of breaking through to,\u201d Stringer said. \u201cYoung people haven\u2019t really had an opportunity to think about the consequences of health care, so signing up is perhaps not one of their priorities. And we have to get to our immigrant population.\u201d\n\nThe lowest uninsured rates in the city are found in the Upper East and Upper West Sides, where 4% lack coverage, and in Tottenville in Staten Island, where the number is 4.5%.\n\nHealth insurance plans under Obamacare opened for enrollment at the beginning of this month, and the enrollment period lasts through the end of January.\n\nClaudia Calhoon, director of health advocacy at the New York Immigration Coalition, said some in immigrant neighborhoods haven\u2019t received information on how to sign up, while others can\u2019t afford the premiums they have to pay for the plans they qualify for.\n\n\u201cThe information continues not to reach some of these immigrant communities,\u201d she said. \u201cAffordability is a huge issue.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.credits": "NEW YORK DAILY NEWS", "sailthru.author": "Erin Durkin", "twitter": {"description": "A new analysis by city Controller Scott Stringer shows 11.4 percent of the population is uninsured.", "title": "Obamacare helps, but 1 million in NYC lack health coverage", "url": "http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/obamacare-helps-1-million-city-lack-health-coverage-article-1.2427795", "image": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2427794.1447041989!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/health9n-1-web.jpg", "site": "@nydailynews", "card": "summary"}, "keywords": "New York City health care coverage, obamacare, obamacare new york, Controller Scott Stringer", "parsely-author": "Erin Durkin", "parsely-type": "article", "sailthru.tags": "New York City health care coverage, obamacare, obamacare new york, Controller Scott Stringer", "nydn_tags": "daily news exclusives, obamacare, scott stringer", "news_keywords": "New York City health care coverage, obamacare, obamacare new york, Controller Scott Stringer", "parsely-link": "http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/obamacare-helps-1-million-city-lack-health-coverage-article-1.2427795", "parsely-title": "Obamacare helps, but 1 million in NYC lack health coverage", "sailthru.date": "2015-11-09T04:00:00-0500", "sailthru.title": "Obamacare helps, but 1 million in NYC lack health coverage", "nydn_section": "New York", "parsely-pub-date": "2015-11-09T09:00:00", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2427794.1447041989!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/health9n-1-web.jpg", "description": "A new analysis by city Controller Scott Stringer shows 11.4 percent of the population is uninsured.", "robots": "NOARCHIVE", "fb": {"admins": 1594068001, "app_id": 107464888913, "pages": 268914272540}, "msvalidate.01": "02916AAC0DA8B068EFE01D721E03ED7E", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/NYDailyNews/"}, "sailthru.description": "A new analysis by city Controller Scott Stringer shows 11.4 percent of the population is uninsured.", "viewport": "width=device-width, height=device-height, initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no", "parsely-section": "New York", "og": {"site_name": "NY Daily News", "description": "A new analysis by city Controller Scott Stringer shows 11.4 percent of the population is uninsured.", "title": "Obamacare helps, but 1 million in NYC lack health coverage", "url": "http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/obamacare-helps-1-million-city-lack-health-coverage-article-1.2427795", "image": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2427794.1447041989!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/health9n-1-web.jpg", "type": "article"}, "parsely-tags": "daily news exclusives, obamacare, scott stringer", "p": {"domain_verify": "78efe4f5c9935744af497772f68a0ee7"}, "nydn_byline": "Erin Durkin", "parsely-image-url": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2427794.1447041989!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/health9n-1-web.jpg"}, "article_summary": "Health insurance plans under Obamacare opened for enrollment at the beginning of this month, and the enrollment period lasts through the end of January.\nNearly 1 million New Yorkers are without health insurance, a new analysis by city Controller Scott Stringer found.\nThe worst rate in the city is in Sunnyside and Woodside in Queens, where 22.5% of people don\u2019t have health care coverage.\nIn addition, some young people have opted not to pay for insurance they don\u2019t think they need.\n\u201cWhen you have a million people without health insurance in a city as large as New York, I think there are real consequences both for the city and families,\u201d Stringer said."}
