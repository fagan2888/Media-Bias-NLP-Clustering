There was a lot of misinformation and misunderstanding, Oscar said.\n\nThere are more than 96,000 brokers in the state licensed to sell accident, health and sickness insurance, according to the state Department of Banking and Insurance.\n\nInsurance brokers throughout the state expect all the new rules and regulations, the\n\nchanges in benefits and tax credits could be a boon for business. At the same time, they are wary of the tectonic shift the industry is undergoing, which is sure to transform how brokers interact with clients and the health insurance companies upon which they rely for commissions.\n\n\u201cThere are two schools of thought,\u201d said Matthew Roy, the immediate past president of the New Jersey Association of Health Underwriters and president of Blue Ocean Benefits and Consulting in Red Bank. \u201cThis could put brokers out of business, but on the other hand there is a lot of opportunity for brokers in that the ones taking it seriously, learning the ins and outs of it, being serious about their craft, they can become a resource for people. \u201d\n\nThe goal of the Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare, is to provide millions access to affordable health insurance. That could mean a plethora of new customers for brokers, according to Dave Mordo, vice president of education and compliance with Walsh Benefits in Fair Haven.\n\n\u201cOpportunities for the broker will increase tenfold under Obamacare,\u201d he said.\n\nBut not everyone is so sanguine.\n\nPresident Obama is fond of saying that purchasing health insurance from the government\u2019s website will be as easy as buying an airline ticket from Kayak.\n\nThat may be good for the consumer. But insurance brokers are wary. (There has been a 50 percent drop in the number of travel agents since 2000, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, in part due to the ease of purchasing tickets online.)\n\n\u201cI expect to lose about 30 percent of my business in the first year,\u201d Oscar said. \u201cI\u2019ve got clients who are going to go online. Once they can go online, of course they are going to drop me.\u201d\n\nThat has the potential to cripple the industry but Oscar said he expects many of his clients to return after a couple years because the Affordable Care Act makes purchasing insurance more than just about finding a plan that covers what you need at a price you can afford. There are dozens of provisions in the law that can affect which plan is really best.\n\nThere are tax implications that could affect what kind of federal subsidy an individual or family receives. And it becomes exponentially more complicated for those purchasing insurance for a small business.\n\nMore than anything else, these new complexities are giving brokers hope that Obamacare might, in fact, make them more necessary than ever.\n\n\u201cA small employer, with fewer than 10 employees, guess who their HR guy is,\u201d Oscar said. \u201cI am.\u201d\n\nBrokers argue picking a plan is only the beginning of the service they offer.\n\nThey are, they say, a guide to the health insurance labyrinth, which can ensnare a novice.\n\nAside from answering questions about who employees must cover to avoid penalties under the new law and which companies might be eligible for tax credits, they can help choosing a plan that covers speech therapy or durable medical equipment or one that has generous maternity benefits.\n\n\u201cEnrollment is a really small piece of the puzzle,\u201d Roy said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just picking a plan, it\u2019s why wasn\u2019t my MRI approved. We navigate that maze for them.\u201d\n\nThe Affordable Care Act, brokers say, may help people afford health insurance but it can\u2019t really help them use it.\n\n\u201cBrokers are still the ultimate consumer advocate for insurance purposes,\u201d Mordo said. \u201cThe navigators are lovely and cute and they got federal money, but when it comes to absolute consumer advocacy and knowledge about health insurance the broker is the only answer to people\u2019s question.\u201d\n\nThe business is also threatened from a provision in the Affordable Care Act that says insurance companies must spend at least 80 cents of every dollar on health care in the individual and small group market. That has many worried that broker commissions are on the chopping block.\n\nA 2011 report from the U.S. Government Accountability Office found that \u201calmost all insurers were reducing brokers\u2019 commissions\u201d because of the new law.\n\nThe National Association of Health Underwriters is lobbying for a bill, which has bipartisan support in Congress including from New Jersey Reps. Leonard Lance (R-7th Dist.) and Rob Andrews (D-1st Dist.), that would exempt commissions from the 80/20 rule. But that bill is languishing in committee.\n\n\u201cBrokers are scared,\u201d said David Glasker, a Westfield insurance broker. \u201cWhether it is justified or not remains to be seen.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "'@river','essex-county','health-news','montclair','obamacare','ocean-county','red-bank'", "title": "Obamacare has insurance brokers excited and wary for future", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Obamacare has insurance brokers excited and wary for future\", \"link\": \"http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2013/10/obamacare_has_insurance_brokers_excited_and_wary_for_future.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://imgick.nj.com/home/njo-media/width620/img/star-ledger/photo/2013/09/13466848-large.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"11412484\", \"pub_date\": \"2013-10-13T12:45:09Z\", \"author\": \"Dan Goldberg | The Star-Ledger\", \"tags\": [\"@river\",\"essex-county\",\"health-news\",\"montclair\",\"obamacare\",\"ocean-county\",\"red-bank\"] }", "twitter": {"image": "http://media.nj.com/star-ledger/photo/2013/09/13466848-small.jpg", "description": "The Affordable Care Act, brokers say, may help people afford health insurance but it can't really help them use it", "card": "summary", "site": "@njdotcom"}, "article_date_updated": "Sunday, October 13, 2013,  8:45 AM", "parsely-metadata": "{\"image_url\": \"http://media.nj.com/star-ledger/photo/2013/09/13466848-large.jpg\", \"author_name\": \"dgoldberg\", \"author_nickname\": \"Dan Goldberg | The Star-Ledger\", \"author_id\": \"8007378\", \"source_blog_name\": \"New Jersey Real-Time News\", \"source_blog_url\": \"http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/\", \"sponsored_content\": \"0\" }", "og": {"site_name": "NJ.com", "description": "The Affordable Care Act, brokers say, may help people afford health insurance but it can't really help them use it", "title": "Obamacare has insurance brokers excited and wary for future", "url": "http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2013/10/obamacare_has_insurance_brokers_excited_and_wary_for_future.html", "image": "http://media.nj.com/design/alpha/img/logo_njo.gif", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "NJ.com", "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Sunday, October 13, 2013,  8:45 AM", "article_author": "Dan Goldberg | The Star-Ledger", "Description": "The Affordable Care Act, brokers say, may help people afford health insurance but it can't really help them use it"}, "article_summary": "\u201dThe goal of the Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare, is to provide millions access to affordable health insurance.\nInsurance brokers throughout the state expect all the new rules and regulations, thechanges in benefits and tax credits could be a boon for business.\nBut insurance brokers are wary.\nPresident Obama is fond of saying that purchasing health insurance from the government\u2019s website will be as easy as buying an airline ticket from Kayak.\nDavid Oscar, an insurance broker in Montclair and a past president of the New Jersey Association of Health Underwriters, said insurance brokers he knew had a different name for Oct. 1."}
