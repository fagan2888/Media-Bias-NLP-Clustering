Graham, who endorsed Jeb Bush before he left the race, backed Cruz last month because, he said, the Texas Republican made the best case that he can beat front-runner. He called on the party to rally around Cruz.

Graham has criticized Cruz in the past, calling the Texas senator his "15th choice."

Cruz's projected win Tuesday could help prevent Trump from securing the 1,237 delegates needed to win the nomination ahead of the Republican National Convention in July.

Many anti-Trump Republicans have pointed to Wisconsin as a potential turning point in the race.
