The uptick can be attributed to a number of factors, including the funding for the Homeland Security Department not being available at the time CBO performed its last audit. (The agency\u2019s money was held up for roughly three months by the GOP-controlled House to protest President Obama\u2019s executive actions on immigration.)\n\nOf the House authorizing committees -- which essentially provide blueprints for appropriations panels whose legislation has the rule of law and which earmarked money for efforts with expired authorizations -- the House Veterans\u2019 Affairs Committee approved the most, with $61 billion going toward what basically amount to zombie programs. The VA received the same dollar amount from Senate authorizers.\n\nRelated: What Repealing Obamacare Would Really Save\n\nBut when Senate Appropriations Committee settled down to hammer out the 12 individual spending bills, the Labor, HHS, Education and Related Agencies subpanels set aside the most, $65 billion, for government programs that had expired authorizations.\n\nSenate Budget Committee chair Mike Enzi (R-WY) called CBO\u2019s report \u201calarming,\u201d noting that it \u201cindicates that most non-defense discretionary spending is currently being awarded to expired programs.\u201d\n\nRelated: Trump\u2019s Tax Cuts Would Add $24.5 Trillion to the Debt\n\n\"Congress should reexamine what we are actually funding in order to improve or eliminate government programs not delivering results,\u201d he said Friday in a statement.\n\nTaking a closer look at the programs and entities could bear fruit as the Republican Congress looks to have its budget blueprint in place by the end of February, well ahead of previous years, thanks to presidential election which has greatly abbreviated the congressional calendar.\n\nHard-right conservatives have already signaled they don\u2019t like the spending limits set by the two-year budget deal Obama signed into law last month and want the ceiling lowered; cutting off funding for programs that are supposed to have expired could provide a way to reach some kind of solution and avoid a nasty intra-party fight.\n\nMeanwhile, about $611 billion in authorizations are due to expire by the end of fiscal 2016, according to CBO. Most of the amount, about $600 billion, is authorized in a single law, the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for fiscal year 2016.\n\nThe massive bill serves as a budget policy roadmap for all Defense Department personnel, including troop pay and pricey weapons efforts.\n\nOther authorizations set to expire at the end of 2016 include a 2015 bill that provided $1 billion for veterans programs and the 2016 Department of the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2016, which authorized less than $1 billion for the Land and Water Conservation Fund.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The federal government is on pace to spend around $310 billion in 2016 on programs tha", "title": "Why Is the Government Spending $310 Billion on \u2018Unauthorized\u2019 Programs?", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/01/18/Why-Government-Spending-310-Billion-Unauthorized-Programs", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/02292012_Capitol1_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/01/18/Why-Government-Spending-310-Billion-Unauthorized-Programs", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/02292012_Capitol1_article.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "The federal government is on pace to spend around $310 billion in 2016 on programs tha", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Related: How Millions of Taxpayer Dollars Were Wasted on Afghan Mining ProjectsThe $310 billion is an increase from the $294 billion CBO identified 2015.\nThe federal government is on pace to spend around $310 billion in 2016 on programs that have expired, according to a new analysis by the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO).\nMeanwhile, about $611 billion in authorizations are due to expire by the end of fiscal 2016, according to CBO.\nMost of the amount, about $600 billion, is authorized in a single law, the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for fiscal year 2016.\nRelated: What Repealing Obamacare Would Really SaveBut when Senate Appropriations Committee settled down to hammer out the 12 individual spending bills, the Labor, HHS, Education and Related Agencies subpanels set aside the most, $65 billion, for government programs that had expired authorizations."}
