Elizabeth Warren supports Trump\u2019s \u201ctax plan.\u201d Warren simply praised Trump\u2019s call to raise taxes on hedge fund managers. Bush\u2019s own tax plan calls for that very same thing.\n\nIndeed, Trump hasn\u2019t released an actual tax plan \u2014 he reportedly will do so later this month \u2014 and his comments about taxes on the campaign trail have been ambiguous, at best.\n\nTrump on Taxes\n\nIn an interview with Time published on Aug. 20, Trump said he was open to considering a fair or flat tax but said it would probably be \u201csimplest\u201d to \u201cleave the tax code the way it is and simplify it.\u201d How would that look? Trump said only that he wanted to \u201csave the middle class\u201d and that he didn\u2019t think \u201chedge fund guys\u201d were paying their fair share. He also said he would not propose any changes that would result in an increase in the net amount of taxes.\n\nTrump has since taken several shots at hedge fund managers, who are paid based on a percentage of their portfolio and the portfolio\u2019s profits. For investments held for more than a year, those profits are called \u201ccarried interest\u201d and are taxed as capital gains. Capital gains are taxed at a lower maximum rate \u2014 23.8 percent, including a 3.8 percent tax in the Affordable Care Act \u2014 than most ordinary income, which carries a top tax rate of 39.6 percent.\n\nDuring an interview on CBS\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation\u201d on Aug. 23, Trump said of hedge fund managers, \u201cThese are guys that shift paper around and they get lucky. \u2026 Half of them, look, they\u2019re energetic, they\u2019re very smart, but a lot of them, it\u2019s like they\u2019re paper pushers. They make a fortune, they pay no tax. It\u2019s ridiculous, OK? \u2026 The hedge fund guys are getting away with murder. They\u2019re making a tremendous amount of money. They have to pay taxes. I want to lower the rates for the middle class. The middle class is the one, they\u2019re getting absolutely destroyed.\u201d\n\nAnd in an Aug. 26 interview with Bloomberg\u2019s \u201cWith All Due Respect,\u201d Trump said he would \u201ctake carried interest out, and I would let people making hundreds of millions of dollars a year pay some tax, because right now they are paying very little tax and I think it\u2019s outrageous.\u201d\n\nOne of the hosts, John Heilemann, noted that that would affect not only hedge fund managers, but also people in limited real estate partnerships \u201cof which you are in a fair number.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo you are proposing you\u2019d like to raise taxes on yourself?\u201d Heilemann asked.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s right. That\u2019s right. I\u2019m OK with it,\u201d Trump said. \u201cYou\u2019ve seen my statements, I do very well, I don\u2019t mind paying some taxes. The middle class is getting clobbered in this country. You know the middle class built this country, not the hedge fund guys, but I know people in hedge funds, they pay almost nothing and it\u2019s ridiculous, OK?\u201d\n\nBush on Taxes and Trump\n\nIn an appearance on ABC\u2019s \u201cThe View\u201d on Sept. 8, Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts praised Trump\u2019s stance on the so-called tax loophole for hedge fund managers. \u201cDonald Trump and I both agree that there ought to be more taxation of the billionaires, the people who are making their money on Wall Street,\u201d Warren said (starting at about the 3-minute mark).\n\nWarren and Trump on the same page? Bush used that as fodder to attack Trump\u2019s conservative credentials.\n\n\u201cI mean, when Elizabeth Warren. \u2026 Yesterday, I almost like, spit up my Diet Coke \u2014 Elizabeth Warren applauded Donald Trump for his tax policies,\u201d Bush said on CNBC\u2019s \u201cSquawk Box.\u201d \u201cI mean, come on. This is \u2018Alice in Wonderland\u2019 time here.\u201d\n\nBush hit on the same theme in an interview on NH1 News in New Hampshire on Sept. 10: \u201cDonald Trump\u2019s tax plan was supported by Elizabeth Warren. Wow. She\u2019s thankfully critical of my plan. That makes me feel better. I would have lost my footing if Elizabeth Warren was saying good things about my plan. But she likes Trump\u2019s. That\u2019s the problem with Donald Trump. He says things off the cuff, he hasn\u2019t thought them through. He\u2019s not grounded in conservative philosophy.\u201d\n\nBut Warren never offered blanket praise for Trump\u2019s \u201ctax policies\u201d or \u201ctax plan.\u201d As we said earlier, there really isn\u2019t a Trump tax plan yet, at least not one that has been publicly released. Warren\u2019s praise was limited to Trump\u2019s stated support for taxing profits made by hedge fund managers as ordinary income.\n\nAnd ironically, that\u2019s one issue on which Warren, Trump and Bush seem to agree. Bush released a detailed tax plan on Sept. 9, and it calls for taxing carried interest at 28 percent, Bush\u2019s proposed highest tax rate for ordinary income.\n\nBackgrounder: Jeb Bush\u2019s Tax Reform Plan: The Reform and Growth Act of 2017, Sept. 9: All non-investment income will be taxed at ordinary rates. That is, only those putting real capital at risk will be able to benefit from the lower rate on capital gains. Specifically, \u201ccarried interest\u201d without real capital at risk will no longer receive the same tax treatment as real investment income, but instead will face a top rate of 28 percent.\n\nAs the lede of a Sept. 10 story in the New York Times put it: \u201cWhat do Jeb Bush, Elizabeth Warren and Donald J. Trump have in common? They would like to raise taxes on \u2018the hedge fund guys.\u2019 \u201d\n\nGrover Norquist, president of the anti-tax group Americans for Tax Reform, dismissed Bush\u2019s position as an attempt to neutralize \u201cthe populist impulse that Trump was tapping into\u201d and said the revenue it raises would be fairly insignificant.\n\nIndeed, when Obama proposed taxing carried interest as ordinary income as part of his 2016 budget proposal, the Joint Committee on Taxation estimated it would bring in an additional $15.6 billion over the next 10 years. (Bush\u2019s plan, which proposes a top tax bracket of 28 percent, as opposed to the current 39.6 percent, would bring in even less.)\n\nThat amounts to a \u201crounding error\u201d in the federal budget, Roberton Williams, the Sol Price fellow at the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, told us in a phone interview. \u201cBottom line, there isn\u2019t a lot of money there.\u201d Alone, he said, it would not provide much room for relief to middle-class taxpayers, as Trump suggests.\n\nBut when it comes to tax plans, the full impact lies in the details, and there isn\u2019t enough to go on from Trump yet to know how his plan might affect lower-, middle- and upper-income taxpayers, Williams said.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know what he\u2019ll release,\u201d Williams said. \u201cWe\u2019ll see what he comes up with.\u201d\n\nBush has released a detailed tax plan, and while the Tax Policy Center has not yet released its analysis, Williams said the \u201cbottom line, if you look at the pieces of it, is it looks like a great big tax cut for the rich.\u201d That\u2019s because Bush proposes to cut the top tax rate from 39.6 percent to 28 percent.\n\nBush would take away some of the \u201cloopholes\u201d and \u201cspecial tax provisions\u201d in the current tax code \u2014 which would offset tax savings to many wealthy taxpayers. But even still, while Bush\u2019s plan would cut taxes and lead to higher after-tax incomes for taxpayers at all levels of income, those at the very top of the income spectrum would see the highest percentage tax decreases, according to an analysis by the Tax Foundation.\n\n\u2014 Robert Farley", "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fddf64\"", "article_summary": "Bush\u2019s own tax plan calls for that very same thing.\nJeb Bush mocked Donald Trump by saying liberal Sen.
