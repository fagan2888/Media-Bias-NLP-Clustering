Dave & Buster's has filed a motion to dismiss the class-action lawsuit that accuses the Texas-based restaurant chain of reducing workers' hours in order to avoid providing health insurance to its employees.

The suit accuses the company of violating a section of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, which prohibits employers from interfering with a worker's right to benefits.

The company's attorneys argue that the plaintiff, a Queens woman who works at the Times Square Dave & Buster's, fails to prove the company specifically targeted employees because of their health insurance status.

Further, ERISA doesn't apply to benefits a worker is not yet entitled to, and the so-called employer mandate did not exist in 2013, when Maria Marin, the lead plaintiff, had her hours reduced.

The company's motion also states that health insurance is not a right even under the A.C.A., pointing out that employers may choose to pay a penalty instead of providing insurance.

"This concession leaves a wide and unbridged gap between the theory of plaintiff's case and the facts alleged to support it," the motion says.

The A.C.A. requires that employers provide coverage to all employees who work more than 30 hours per week, or else pay a penalty for every uninsured employee.

Opponents of Obamacare have long warned the mandate would cause businesses to either avoid hiring employees or reduce their full-time employees to part-time employees to avoid paying for health insurance.

Republicans in Congress have tried change the mandate so that it would only apply to those who 40 hours per week, which would subject far fewer employees to the mandate, but those attempts have so far failed.

Dave & Buster's contends that reducing hours was an effort to "right size" its workforce, but from a legal perspective, it shouldn't matter, the lawyers say.

ERISA, the basis of the suit, offers no protection for a right such as the health insurance mandated under the Affordable Care Act.
