(Photo: TRIBUNE PHOTO/RION SANDERS )Buy Photo\n\nMontana has put a dent in the number of its residents who lack health insurance following the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, but it still lags the rest of the nation.\n\nA June study by the Kaiser Family Foundation health care information organization puts the Treasure State in 34th place for health coverage.\n\nThis is despite the 30,018 people an analysis by the state Commissioner of Securities and Insurance counts as now covered who didn\u2019t have insurance before ACA coverage first became available Jan. 1.\n\nThose newly covered individuals reduced the previous number of uninsured, estimated at 195,000, by 15.4 percent. That dropped the percentage of uninsured in Montana from about 20 percent to 16.9 percent, according to CSI\u2019s analysis.\n\nA large majority of the newly insured found coverage through the Marketplace, with smaller numbers receiving Medicaid or finding policies through the private insurance sector, CSI estimated.\n\nKaiser puts Montana\u2019s uninsured post ACA-implementation level at 17.6.\n\nTina Bundtrock said she worked with about 1,600 people on how to access ACA during the Oct. 1 to March 31 open enrollment and got 836 people signed up.\n\nSince then, the certified application counselor has been working with about 10 people a month interested in enrolling with ACA, in her office at Cascade City-County Health Department.\n\nSpecial enrollment period\n\nThat\u2019s through a little-known feature of the health-insurance law called a Special Enrollment Period that allows people to sign up anytime in the Health Insurance Marketplace with certain qualifying life events.\n\nOf course a major factor is having lost health coverage within the last 60 days, or expecting to lose it within 60 days, but not voluntarily ending coverage.\n\nOr within the last 60 days:\n\n\u2022 Lost coverage due to divorce.\n\n\u2022 Policy or plan year ended for policy you bought yourself.\n\n\u2022 COBRA coverage expired.\n\n\u2022 Turned 26 and aged off a parent\u2019s health plan.\n\n\u2022 Lost eligibility for Medicaid or CHIP.\n\n\u2022 Got married\n\n\u2022 Had a baby, adopted a child or had a child placed with you for foster care.\n\n\u2022 Got divorced and lost health insurance.\n\n\u2022 Death of household policyholder.\n\nOther special circumstances:\n\n\u2022 Moved outside health plan\u2019s coverage area.\n\n\u2022 Had a change in income.\n\n\u2022 Gained citizenship or lawful presence in the U.S.\n\n\u2022 Released from incarceration (prison or detention).\n\nMembers of federally recognized tribes, or Alaska Native corporation shareholders can sign up throughout the year.\n\nRhiannon Simon, who worked as an ACA navigator at Planned Parenthood in Great Falls during the term of a grant that ended Aug. 15, said that, outside the established sign-up period, \u201cenrollment requires more guidance. A lot of people are not aware\u201d of the special enrollment period.\n\nAmanda Roccabruna Eby, CSI project administrator said the agency isn\u2019t doing proactive outreach to make people aware of special-enrollment opportunities. However, the agency provides updated ACA information at its website montanahealthanswers.com.\n\n\u2018People are confused\u2019\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re always trying be a resource for consumers,\u201d she said. \u201cA lot of education continues to happen for folks.\u201d She said consumers also may call CSI at 800-332-6148 to connect with someone who can provide information on ACA.\n\nOne of the biggest misconceptions she finds is that \u201csome people are confused, but (ACA) is insurance,\u201d Simon said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a \u2018public option\u2019 and it\u2019s not Medicaid.\u201d\n\nDuring the legislative process leading to the passage of the ACA, public option was a concept that would have created a government-run health-insurance agency that would compete with private insurance companies. Medicaid is the joint state-federal health coverage for low-income people.\n\nWhile ACA in general \u201cis not meant to encourage people to leave their jobs\u201d knowing they could still get some coverage, it could, among other things, enable middle-aged workers who want to stop working one \u2014 or a few \u2014 years short of Medicare eligibility to \u201cnow be better-prepared to retire and figure out if they want to accept COBRA,\u201d the system that enables them to continue their employers\u2019 coverage for up to 18 months by paying the full premium, Simon said.\n\nFitzgerald Clark, lead educator at Planned Parenthood in Billings, said there are \u201cstill a lot of misunderstandings,\u201d about ACA. \u201cThere are a lot of different groups and people who did not support the law and spread a lot of misinformation about what it was and how it could help people.\u201d\n\nHe said \u201ca couple of big misunderstandings are that the government is providing insurance and taking over\u201d the health care system.\n\nIn reality, \u201cit\u2019s utilization of private market subsidies\u201d in order to enable people to better afford insurance.\u201d The law also established rules so \u201cinsurance companies could not deny coverage for pre-existing conditions or drop people if they became sick.\u201d\n\nA lot of people didn\u2019t understand they could get subsidies to help pay for their premiums if they qualified.\n\nBasing premiums\n\nHe said the coverages and premiums they see when they apply through the website are based on income and life circumstance. \u201cTax credits are applied automatically,\u201d he said, and some people may qualify for assistance in paying for out-of-pocket costs, such as deductibles and co-pays.\n\nThe concept is based on Advanced Premium Tax Credits, based on what\u2019s reported on the applicant\u2019s income-tax return. If the premium for a certain policy is \u201cnormally $500 a month, (tax credit) could lower the cost out of pocket (for premium) to maybe $300.\u201d\n\nRates are based on what enrollees estimate their income will be in the application.\n\nThe ACA assisters are unanimous in emphasizing that applicants should be very careful when estimating their income because if they end up reporting much more income on their next tax return they could owe a much bigger tax payment. That\u2019s because, as a tax credit, the ACA subsidies are directly related to the bottom line on their tax return.\n\nConversely applicants whose incomes drop lower than what they estimated would pay less on their return \u2014 or get a bigger refund \u2014 on their tax returns. \u201cI try to break it down to my folks to avoid sticker shock,\u201d Bundtrock said.\n\nFor the same reasons, the assisters advise reporting, on the Marketplace website or by phone, significant changes in income as they occur during the year.\n\nSimon said ACA eligibility is based solely on income. Assets are not considered when qualifying for subsidies in the Marketplace. Medicaid eligibility does consider financial resources other than income, though.\n\nFederal Marketplace\n\nThe ACA Marketplace in Montana is the federal Health Insurance Marketplace at healthcare.gov\n\nThree organizations in Montana received grants to provide navigators for the 2014 enrollment period and continue assistance through the summer:\n\n\u2022 Montana Health Network.\n\n\u2022 Montana Primary Care Association Inc.\n\n\u2022 Planned Parenthood of Montana Inc.\n\nThere are three categories of people trained to help with ACA:\n\n\u2022 Navigators are public advisers who help individuals and small employers compare the health insurance options in the new Marketplace website. Navigators have taken federal and state training. They have been fingerprinted and have undergone a Montana background check.\n\n\u2022 Certified Application Counselors are health care provider staff who have been trained to help people understand, apply for and enroll in insurance coverage through the Marketplace.\n\n\u2022 Certified Exchange Producers are registered Montana Insurance Agents who have taken special training to understand the Marketplace.\n\nIn addition to their additional training, navigators perform outreach duties, providing educational opportunities to the public to help people understand the law. Navigators also can be expected to have a strong understanding of Medicaid, for which some clients may qualify, and the general health-insurance market in their states.\n\nThere are 27 navigators in Montana, including two in Great Falls, and 120 CACs, including nine in Great Falls.\n\nClark said \u201cwe had a (Department of Health and Human Services) grant to provide navigation services\u201d from Aug. 15, 2013, to Aug. 14, 2014.\n\nThe gap is coming because signup for 2014 started in October, while signup for 2015 runs Nov. 15 until Feb. 15. The navigator grants are \u201cto provide education and assistance to consumers and educate them to navigate the site and enroll in the Marketplace for insurance.\u201d The deadline to apply for navigator grants was in July.\n\nClark said \u201call three 2013 recipients resubmitted. \u2026 There may be others.\u201d Applicants are supposed to be notified Sept. 8.\n\nBundtrock is able to continue offering assistance because her CAC position at the Cascade City-County Health Department is funded by additional money added to the agency\u2019s base grant from the Health Resources and Services Administration that helps support the center\u2019s operation.\n\nThe grant requires CCHD to \u201ckeep pulse on outreach and enrollment\u201d in ACA.\n\nThe CAC function \u201coriginally was one-time-funded and with the success we\u2019ve had,\u201d she said the Affordable Care counseling program should \u201cstay in place and continue.\u201d\n\nCSI trains, certifies and regulates navigators and CACs, Roccabruna Eby said, and \u201cwe\u2019re going to work with navigator organizations to make sure they have all the resources in place to help consumers get enrolled.\u201d\n\nMany still uninsured\n\nThe Kaiser Family Foundation estimates 178,000 people are uninsured in Montana. Of those:\n\n\u2022 43,000 are ineligible for assistance. Includes those whose income is too high to be eligible for tax credits, who have affordable employer coverage available, or who are undocumented immigrants.\n\n\u2022 67,000 tax-credit eligible. Incomes 100 percent to 400 percent of the poverty level who are eligible to buy coverage on Marketplace and do not have other affordable coverage available.\n\n\u2022 40,000 fall in the coverage gap with no financial assistance \u2014 adults not eligible for Medicaid who do not qualify Marketplace subsidies.\n\n\u2022 28,000 are eligible for Medicaid or CHIP, but are not now enrolled.\n\nMedicaid gap\n\nIn Montana, a family of four \u2014 two adults and two children \u2014 would be covered by Medicaid or the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program with a family income of $0 to $62,643. Above that higher income, they then receive a tax credit for coverage in the marketplace up to a family income of $94,200.\n\nThe parents also would qualify for Medicaid up to a family income of $12,169, and would receive the tax credit for family income of $23,550 to 94,200. But the parents fall in the no-benefit Medicaid gap between $12,169 and $23,550 annual incomes.\n\nThey can still enroll\n\nAn analysis of Census data by Enroll America projects that almost 10,000 people can enroll in ACA under the Special Enrollment Period allowed for certain circumstances.\n\nThe group also estimates the largest number of Montanans, 35,000 to 100,000 people, aged 0-64. resides in Northwestern Montana. Northcentral Montana, the Billings area and the Missoula area are in the second tier with each region numbering 25,000 to 35,000. The rest of the state, comprising counties around Helena, counties around Bozeman and all of Eastern Montana outside Yellowstone County, number 15,000 to 25,000 in each of the three areas.\n\nSo what does it cost?\n\nIn the Marketplace, three companies provide plans for Montanans.\n\n\u2022 Montana Health Cooperative.\n\n\u2022 Blue Cross Blue Shield of Montana.\n\n\u2022 PacificSource Health Plans.\n\nDepending upon age and income, about two or three dozen plans may be available. Some examples:\n\nA young couple, 27 and 25, with an annual income of $20,000, could find a Bronze policy with a deductible as low as $3,950 per year per person and out of pocket maximum of $6,350 per person at no cost.\n\nThe Platinum plan for that young couple has a $350 deductible and out-of-pocket maximum of $1,200 for $126 per month.\n\nA couple just short of qualifying for Medicare, ages 64 and 62, with a $20,000 income can get the same plans for no cost and $299 per month, respectively.\n\nHouseholds with higher incomes pay progressively higher prices and a two-person household with income above $62,040 loses all subsidies.\n\nThe younger couple would pay $319 a month for the Bronze plan and $495 for the Platinum plan in the Marketplace, if they made too much to qualify for a subsidy.\n\nThe older couple\u2019s premiums would be $911 and $1,417, respectively.\n\nRates vary by company and coverage terms and may include different amounts of co-payment and prescription coverage, as well as different networks. Some networks may only cover certain providers in the subscriber\u2019s region; some may cover many providers, nationwide. Smokers pay higher premiums.\n\nJennifer McKee, CSI communications director, said Montana rates on the exchange are going up an average of 1.35 percent for 2015 coverage, significantly below national cost increases. In a Wednesday news release, she stated Montana \u201chealth insurance rate hikes, for the five years prior to 2014 (increased) 13 percent to 18 percent in the individual market and 8.4 percent to 15.3 percent in the small group market.\u201d\n\nRead or Share this story: http://www.greatfallstribune.com/story/news/local/2014/08/27/montana-uninsured-rate-still-high/14711953/", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "ACA enrollment still available in certain circumstances", "og": {"site_name": "Great Falls Tribune", "description": "ACA enrollment still available in certain circumstances", "title": "Montana uninsured rate still high", "url": "http://www.greatfallstribune.com/story/news/local/2014/08/27/montana-uninsured-rate-still-high/14711953/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/greatfallstribune.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "ACA enrollment still available in certain circumstances", "creator": "@GFTribune", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/ea679eb8272829a164295ad33ad544a208062563/c=380-0-2021-1641&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/GreatFalls/2014/08/27/tinabundtrock-a.jpg", "title": "Montana uninsured rate still high", "site": "@GFTribune", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=863095595", "fb": {"app_id": 137930962930704}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": ""}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc240\"", "article_summary": "Federal MarketplaceThe ACA Marketplace in Montana is the federal Health Insurance Marketplace at healthcare.govThree organizations in Montana received grants to provide navigators for the 2014 enrollment period and continue assistance through the summer:\u2022 Montana Health Network.\n\u2022 Montana Health Cooperative.\nA June study by the Kaiser Family Foundation health care information organization puts the Treasure State in 34th place for health coverage.\n\u2022 Certified Exchange Producers are registered Montana Insurance Agents who have taken special training to understand the Marketplace.\nThat dropped the percentage of uninsured in Montana from about 20 percent to 16.9 percent, according to CSI\u2019s analysis."}
