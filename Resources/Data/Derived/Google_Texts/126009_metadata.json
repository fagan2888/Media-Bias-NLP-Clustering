Her daughter recently entered the business school and the cost is exponentially more, at $60,000 a year.\n\nShe cited statistics from her strategy office that show the price of tuition and fees, on average, grew over 550 percent from 1985 to 2011 -- easily outpacing the roughly 350 percent rise in the price of health care during that time.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re doing a really good job of increasing our charges faster than any other industry,\u201d Deland said of higher education and health care.\n\nMeanwhile, she acknowledged the massive enterprise of health care spending, including criticisms of wasteful spending. Health care is a roughly $2.9 trillion annual industry in the U.S., and some estimate that as much as $750 billion is being spent wastefully each year.\n\nThe rising price of health care and higher education, and cost of delivery, are far from the only things the two sectors have in common.\n\nBoth are learning how to live with less public money.\n\nJust as state appropriations in public higher education have declined in recent decades, the Affordable Care Act is translating into less federal money for hospitals and health care systems. Deland estimates that New York-Presbyterian is poised to lose at least $1.5 billion in federal dollars over the next five years because of changes resulting from the ACA.\n\nMeanwhile, both industries are being disrupted by new technologies -- especially online delivery systems. In higher education, that in part means MOOCs and online and interactive components to traditional courses (Deland said three of her friends have forgone graduate courses for MOOCs instead).\n\nIn health care, hospitals and systems are exploring teleheath delivery systems in which patients receive maintenance care, follow-up appointments and medical information through telecommunication devices like computers and smartphones. The practice has the power, according to Deland, to \u201ctruly revolutionize the delivery system of health care\u201d and create much more consumer-friendly care.\n\nHospitals and health systems have also been merging and acquiring one another with increasing frequency. Deland said that in recent decades New York City went from having about 75 independent hospitals to six hospital systems.\n\nAnd while the scale and scope of mergers in higher education is much smaller, universities and colleges are having to find more ways to work together and create efficiencies as they try to trim costs.\n\nFor both industries, adjusting to new challenges has been an uphill climb.\n\nThe NACUBO conference is titled \u201cThe Tempo of Change,\u201d in part because colleges and universities are grappling with how to adapt to an era of financial difficulty and increased scrutiny and in part as a play on Nashville's nickname, Music City.\n\nHealth care is learning to adapt to a similar reality, Deland said.\n\n\u201cIn health care, that tempo has accelerated to almost epic proportions,\u201d she offered, adding later: \u201cAcademic medical centers are profoundly good at sticking our heads in the sand because \u2018we\u2019re different, we\u2019re special.\u2019\u201d\n\nBut in order to thrive in ever-changing environments, hospitals and universities have to tackle challenges with their eyes wide open.\n\n\u201cThis is not a short road,\u201d Deland readily admits.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2015/07/20/health-care-and-higher-education-face-similar-challenges-and-transformations", "image": "https://www.insidehighered.com/sites/all/themes/ihecustom/images/facebook_icon_large.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "The two industries differ in key ways but face several similar and pressing challenges.", "title": "Health care and higher education face similar challenges and transformations"}, "msapplication-config": "/IEconfig.xml", "description": "The two industries differ in key ways but face several similar and pressing challenges.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "robots": "follow, index"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2cce\"", "article_summary": "\u201cWe\u2019re doing a really good job of increasing our charges faster than any other industry,\u201d Deland said of higher education and health care.\nJust as state appropriations in public higher education have declined in recent decades, the Affordable Care Act is translating into less federal money for hospitals and health care systems.\nThe rising price of health care and higher education, and cost of delivery, are far from the only things the two sectors have in common.\nMeanwhile, she acknowledged the massive enterprise of health care spending, including criticisms of wasteful spending.\nIn health care, hospitals and systems are exploring teleheath delivery systems in which patients receive maintenance care, follow-up appointments and medical information through telecommunication devices like computers and smartphones."}
