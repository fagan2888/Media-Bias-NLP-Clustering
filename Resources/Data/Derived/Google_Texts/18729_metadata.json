The newspaper reported that at least three of the commenters disappeared or deactivated their profiles when the Washington Times announced their investigation.\n\nMultiple individuals had commented thousands of times, the Washington Times found in their investigation.\n\nThe Obamacare page has more than 771,000 likes and is operated by Obama\u2019s campaign arm, Organizing for Action. The group declined to comment to the newspaper about their findings.\n\n\u2014\n\nFollow Oliver Darcy (@oliverdarcy) on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30; polling-uri=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/1.xml; polling-uri2=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/2.xml; polling-uri3=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/3.xml; polling-uri4=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/4.xml", "application-name": "TheBlaze.com", "twitter": {"description": "Approximately 60 percent of the comments on the Affordable Care Act's Facebook page are from fewer than 100 unique profiles, according to a Washington Times analysis.
