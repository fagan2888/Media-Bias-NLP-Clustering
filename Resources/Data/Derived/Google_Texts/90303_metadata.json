One of those Americans is Washington Post reporter Jason Rezaian.\n\nBy the administration's own admission and standards Rezaian, who has been held in an Iranian prison for more than a year, is being held on trumped up, bogus charges. This morning, it is being reported Rezaian has been issued a verdict on those same charges after a closed door \"trial.\"\n\nAn Iranian judiciary spokesman said Sunday that a verdict has been reached in the espionage case of Washington Post reporter Jason Rezaian, though he offered no details. It was uncertain what the verdict is and whether there is a sentence.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe ruling on this case has been issued,\u201d Gholam Hossein Mohseni Ejei said in his weekly televised news conference with Iranian journalists. \u201cThere is still the possibility of this ruling being appealed, and it is not final.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe Post has vehemently disputed the allegation that Rezaian was a spy. Executive Editor Martin Baron has said that Rezaian was acting solely as a journalist, and he has called the trial a \u201csham\u201d and \u201ca sick brew of farce and tragedy.\u201d\n\nBREAKING: Iran state TV says Washington Post reporter Jason Rezaian convicted after closed-door trial on various charges \u2014 Fox News (@FoxNews) October 12, 2015\n\nWe'll have to wait and see whether Rezaian has been convicted on charges. Based on the talks from Iranian sources about an appeal, things aren't looking good.\n\nIn the meantime, Iran is still unjustly holding U.S. Pastor Saeed Abedini, U.S. Marine Amir Hekmati, FBI agent Robert Levinson and of course, Rezaian. No word yet from the White House on how the administration plans to help.\n\nUPDATE: Rezaian convicted as guilty.\n\nThe Washington Post on Monday angrily denounced the conviction of one of its reporters in a secret Iranian court, calling the proceeding an \"outrageous injustice.\"\n\n\n\nWashington Post Executive Editor Martin Baron criticized Iran\u2019s conviction of Post reporter Jason Rezaian in a closed-door trial on charges that are unclear, saying the verdict was unconscionable.\n\n\n\nRezaian was found guilty of various allegations by an Iranian court, the country's state TV reported late Sunday.\n\n\n\n\"Iran has behaved unconscionably throughout this case, but never more so than with this indefensible decision by a Revolutionary Court to convict an innocent journalist of serious crimes after a proceeding that unfolded in secret, with no evidence whatsoever of any wrongdoing. For now, no sentence has been announced,\" Baron said in a statement Monday.\n\n\n\nIt was not immediately clear of what exactly Rezaian had been convicted. He had faced multiple charges, including espionage, at his trial, which was widely criticized by the U.S. government and press freedom organizations.\n\n\n\nRezaian reportedly faces up to 20 years in prison if convicted on all charges.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Bogus. .05/27/2016 9:17:04AM EST.", "author": "Katie Pavlich", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Bogus.", "title": "Verdict Reached in Case of American Journalist Obama Left Behind in Iran", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/katiepavlich/2015/10/12/after-nuclear-deal-iranians-convict-washington-post-reporter-on-bogus-charges-n2064519", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015/284/2015-10-11T232830Z_1_LYNXNPEB9A0MW_RTROPTP_3_IRAN-USA-TRIAL.JPG", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Bogus.", "title": "Verdict Reached in Case of American Journalist Obama Left Behind in Iran", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/katiepavlich/2015/10/12/after-nuclear-deal-iranians-convict-washington-post-reporter-on-bogus-charges-n2064519", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015/284/2015-10-11T232830Z_1_LYNXNPEB9A0MW_RTROPTP_3_IRAN-USA-TRIAL.JPG", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "UPDATE: Guilty; Verdict Reached in Case of American Journalist Obama Left Behind in Iran , Katie Pavlich, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "One of those Americans is Washington Post reporter Jason Rezaian.\nAn Iranian judiciary spokesman said Sunday that a verdict has been reached in the espionage case of Washington Post reporter Jason Rezaian, though he offered no details.\nUPDATE: Rezaian convicted as guilty.\nWashington Post Executive Editor Martin Baron criticized Iran\u2019s conviction of Post reporter Jason Rezaian in a closed-door trial on charges that are unclear, saying the verdict was unconscionable.\nThis morning, it is being reported Rezaian has been issued a verdict on those same charges after a closed door \"trial.\""}
