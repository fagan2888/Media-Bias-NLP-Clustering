Of these immigrants, 167,527 are convicted criminals.\n\n\u201cThe long-term ramifications are continued crime inflicted upon U.S citizens,\u201d said Marguerite Telford, director of communications at the Center for Immigration Studies. \u201cSo the administration\u2019s catch and release policy means these criminal aliens are free to commit additional crimes.\u201d\n\nOther reports confirm fewer illegal immigrants are being detained.\n\nAccording to a report released by the Government Accountability Office in November 2014, ICE\u2019s Alternatives to Detention (ATD) program grew from 32,065 to 40,864 from fiscal year 2011 to 2013. The ATD program began in 2004 as a cost-saving alternative to detaining illegal immigrants.\n\nDavid Inserra, an expert on homeland security at The Heritage Foundation, says it\u2019s not a bad thing that more immigrants are entering the Alternatives to Detention Program.\n\n\u201cRobust forms of ATD, such a GPS tracking anklets, are cost-effective ways to ensure that illegal immigrants show up at court hearings,\u201d Inserra said. \u201cWith that being said, some individuals need to be detained and criminal aliens fit that bill. While the use of proven and strong ATD should expand, the administration should also be filling its detention beds, as is required by law, rather than allowing known criminal aliens to be released.\u201d\n\nIn fiscal year 2014, 30,558 criminally-convicted illegal immigrants\u2014who had 79,059 total convictions between them\u2014were released by Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\n\nOf these, 4,088 convictions were related to immigration offenses. Only 8 percent of criminal releases in 2014 were because native countries would not accept the immigrants back.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Center for Immigration Studies reports that arrests of non-citizens who have been convicted of a crime decreased by 32 percent since last year.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The Center for Immigration Studies reports that arrests of non-citizens who have been convicted of a crime decreased by 32 percent since last year.", "title": "US Arresting Fewer Criminally-Convicted Illegal Immigrants", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/How-Obama-Should-Deal-With-Children-Crossing-Border-Illegally.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-06-10T23:25:06+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1S4Uzdl"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The Center for Immigration Studies reports that arrests of non-citizens who have been convicted of a crime decreased by 32 percent since last year.", "title": "US Arresting Fewer Criminally-Convicted Illegal Immigrants", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/How-Obama-Should-Deal-With-Children-Crossing-Border-Illegally.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Society", "tag": "immigration", "published_time": "2015-06-10T16:31:17+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-10T23:25:06+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "illegal immigration, Center for Immigration Studies, Immigration and Customs Enforcement"}, "article_summary": "However, the Center for Immigration Studies says this does not indicate there are fewer criminally convicted illegal immigrants in the United States, but rather, the government is arresting fewer of such people overall.\n\u201cSo the administration\u2019s catch and release policy means these criminal aliens are free to commit additional crimes.\u201dOther reports confirm fewer illegal immigrants are being detained.\nAdditionally, the report shows that approximately 904,000 illegal immigrants have not left the country, despite orders to be removed.\n\u201cRobust forms of ATD, such a GPS tracking anklets, are cost-effective ways to ensure that illegal immigrants show up at court hearings,\u201d Inserra said.\nThe ATD program began in 2004 as a cost-saving alternative to detaining illegal immigrants."}
