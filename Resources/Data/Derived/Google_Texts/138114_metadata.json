These legends will be racing to win in the Sept. 12 Durango Dirt Fondo, a 50-mile and 30-mile race that traces Purgatory\u2019s most storied trails.\n\nPut on by the indomitable Overend and Durango Olympian Todd Wells and supported by the pair\u2019s longtime sponsor Specialized bikes, the weekend will include not just open-to-all races but the rarest opportunity to mingle with the icons of knobby-tired competition. Overend was the first-ever world champion at age 35 and Tomac took that honor the following year. The top women of mountain biking \u2013 Matthes, Balantyne and the sport\u2019s first downhill world champion Cindy Devine \u2013 will be there too.\n\nThe races will follow singletrack used in the 2001 World Cup, NORBA Nationals, the Iron Horse Bicycle Class, the Single Speed World Championships and even the 1990 Worlds Dual Slalom Course.\n\nAs of Thursday there were still race spots open.
