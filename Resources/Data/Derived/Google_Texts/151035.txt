The political action committee Florida Health Solutions launched a petition drive this week to get a constitutional amendment supporting Medicaid expansion onto the Florida ballot in 2016.

Florida is one of 20 states that has not expanded Medicaid under the provisions of Affordable Care Act.

That leaves about 1.1 million Floridians who made too much money to qualify for Medicaid but whose income is at or below 133 percent of the poverty line, making them ineligible to buy insurance under the Affordable Care Act. Had Florida expanded Medicaid to those people beginning in January 2014, the state would have received $51 billion over 10 years. But the Florida legislature has declined to take the money.

Jacksonville businessman Mincy Pollock is chairman of Florida Health Solutions, which intends to get 683,149 signatures from registered voters on a petition calling for the a constitutional amendment that would require Florida to accept the federal money to be included on the ballot during the 2016 presidential election. Those signatures must come from registered voters in 14 of Florida’s 27 congressional districts. The deadline to collect the signed petitions is Feb. 1, 2016.

During a news conference in Jacksonville on Tuesday morning announcing her support for the petition drive, U.S. Rep. Corrine Brown called it “inhumane to deny the uninsured access to quality health care. Right here in Jacksonville, we have more than 180,000 citizens who are uninsured.”

The petition can be seen at http://floridahealthsolutions.org/. Copies can be picked up and signed copies dropped off at Brown’s Jacksonville office, 101 E. Union St., suite 202, or at the Beaver Street Enterprise Center, 1225 W. Beaver St,
