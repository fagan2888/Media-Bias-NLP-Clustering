She hears a confident voice coming from Eagle Rock City Hall that entices her in.\n\nInside, David Garcia, a handsome, charismatic Latino, is speaking stirringly to a group of concerned parents. He says, \u201cThere\u2019s like bird shit all over the place \u2014 I mean you got kids eating five-day-old sloppy joes. Our public school system is broken. I don\u2019t think we can fix the old schools but I\u2019ll tell you what we can do. We can build a new one. Isn\u2019t a great school no more than a box and an inspired teacher inside of it? We need a great charter school here in Eagle Rock. Let\u2019s create a place for our children to flourish. There\u2019s a big empty hole in our community. And if we don\u2019t do anything about it, our kids are going to be more disenfranchised and lost than we are now.\u201d\n\nMichelle is entranced, and suddenly her life has found a purpose.\n\nCharter school dogma has made it to the Big Time: It just got its own soapbox on the Duplass brothers\u2019 HBO Sunday night series \u201cTogetherness.\u201d\n\nThe one thing the aging-hipster parents know of their school district, Los Angeles Unified, is its \u201cbroken-ness\u201d \u2014 and by extension, the rest of America\u2019s obsession with that term. These \u201cthoughtful\u201d parents don\u2019t waste one breath discussing the possibility of their white middle-class children attending their neighborhood school, saving it instead for lengthy wails of anxiety about private school applications and liberal guilt about isolating their kids from \u201cthe community.\u201d\n\nWho cares what a Hollywood show about \u201cdisenfranchised and lost\u201d film industry workers and their precious progeny does?\n\nWe all should, because \u201cTogetherness\u201d very much reflects the state of national discourse on education and its corrosive effects on public schools, particularly as it has played out in Los Angeles. (I taught in LAUSD public schools for 20 years.) The show also presciently mirrors a current school board race in that district that is pitting a charter school reformer against an old-time public school advocate.\n\nWith \u201cTogetherness,\u201d we witness the battle through the intersection of art, politics, race and class.\n\nThe show\u2019s creators, Mark and Jay Duplass, are the very talented Hollywood powerhouse titans of smart, artsy films about the white middle class and its obsessions; their work dominates Sundance and they have a four-picture deal with Netflix. The brothers also live in Eagle Rock, Los Angeles School Board District 5, and that\u2019s where they\u2019ve set \u201cTogetherness.\u201d It also happens to be where I live and will send my son to school when he is old enough. Although the show is ostensibly about the marriage and lives of Hollywood sound man Brett and his wife, Michelle, the charter school plotline is enlightening and can be discussed in light of not only LAUSD\u2019s relationship to these characters, but to the nation as a whole.\n\nThe charter school speech-maker, David Garcia, an aspiring politician, begins with the mantra that has been drummed around the country for the last 20 years: \u201cOur public education system is broken.\u201d\n\nIs it broken in Palos Verdes? In Beverly Hills? In Malibu? Or any of the richer districts that surround L.A.? No, but definitely, apparently, in Eagle Rock.\n\nMichelle goes up to David after his speech and says, \u201cMy daughter is going to start kindergarten and we\u2019re talking about where is she going to go\u2026 what is she going to do\u2026 I\u2019m wondering why is there not some community place \u2014 somewhere I can put her and feel good with a lot of different people. I don\u2019t want to put her in a private school where she doesn\u2019t get to experience what life is like where we live. I mean why is there not a great place?\u201d\n\nThe Eagle Rock public schools are obviously not an option for Michelle. Our local elementary schools \u2014 Eagle Rock, Rockdale, Dahlia Heights \u2014 get conflated into the fictional \u201cTownsend Elementary,\u201d and are clearly not gonna cut it. It goes without saying.\n\nMichelle has previously been shown speaking longingly to her husband, who has all but decided to put their kid in private school: \u201cDon\u2019t you want her to be in a different kind of community with kids of different colors and economic backgrounds?\n\nThat obviously \u2014 to these characters and to many real life members of their demographic \u2014 isn\u2019t the public schools.\n\nBut why not? One LAUSD school board member has said pointedly that \u201cmaybe it\u2019s time for the district to look in the mirror and figure out what can be done within district schools to make parents less eager to remove their children into charters.\u201d\n\nTrue enough. And maybe it\u2019s time for charter school advocates to look into their own mirror.\n\nIs it, could it actually be, the \u201cbird shit\u201d and \u201cfive-day-old sloppy joes\u201d? No, because episode 6 demonstrates how hard Michelle is willing to work to find and clean out an old building for the new school. Surely, cleaning up some bird feces at an already functioning facility and agitating for better food \u2014 or packing a lunchbox \u2014 would have been much easier.\n\nIs it because a bloated school bureaucracy is truly causing these parents to be \u201cdisenfranchised and lost\u201d? Not really, because when David and Michelle finally make their impassioned plea for a charter to the public school commission in Sacramento, they are met with misty-eyed commissioners and an implied approval.\n\nCould it be \u2014 gasp! \u2014 race, or class? Eagle Rock Elementary School is only 17 percent white, with 57 percent of the kids qualifying for subsidized school lunches.\n\nNo, no, no, no! the series replies. In the final episode, there is Michelle leading a post-racial bandwagon, driving up to Sacramento to argue their case. Along with David, the show\u2019s sole Latino, there\u2019s a gay Asian political consultant and a black principal who will fight for this charter. They all bond over a car karaoke hit.\n\nWealthy white people, as a rule, control the charter school industry across the country. White people run the billionaire philanthropic foundations that funnel money into charter schools. White people dominate the editorial boards of the major urban papers who sympathize with charter school interests. But, in a smoke-screen that has also been used in real life, we get well-spoken, dynamic David as our charter spokesman for the show.\n\nClass, he and the show simply never address.\n\nNeighborhood schools have become the bogeyman for all of society\u2019s social failings, particularly from a class of moneyed interests who share both Democratic and Republican affiliations. For Brett and Michelle Pierson and many white parents of their education and class, all the education reform nonsense might \u201cfeel right\u201d for minority kids \u2014 but just not for their children. The reality is that these power parents, who share a kinship with almost all of L.A.\u2019s economic, political and media elite, do not want to send their own kids to a school that neo-liberal mayors of Chicago, Washington, D.C., and New York, who aggressively pursued the reform agenda, created for the working-class kids of color they \u201cserved.\u201d All these cities had school superintendents who believed in a different pedagogy for poor kids.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Rich whites run charter industry and funnel them cash.
