Her 11-year-old daughter was rushed to the hospital with non-life-threatening injuries.\n\nLisa Clevenger, who lives nearby, said she walked out of her home when she heard the screams of the daughter. Clevenger said she couldn't believe what she saw.\n\n\u201cI was in shock,\" she said. \"I\u2019m still a little freaked out by what happened last night.\"\n\nClevenger said she stayed up all night watching detectives work through the night.\n\nEvidence at the scene sent investigators four miles south, to the 10100 block of South Nogales Highway, where they located a 1992 Oldsmobile Cutlass Ciera with significant damage consistent with a crash.\n\nWith the help of K9 and air units, officers arrested 22-year-old Joshua Ochoa without a struggle, according to the media release.\n\nInvestigators believe speed and alcohol are factors in the crash. Ochoa was booked into the Pima County Jail and is charged with multiple crimes, including:\n\nSecond degree murder\n\nAggravated assault\n\nHit-and-run involving death/injury\n\nPossession of marijuana\n\nPossession of drug paraphernalia\n\nNeighbors like Clevenger, and Carmen Romero, said they won't walk near the road anymore because of this crash. Romero said the intersection needs better lighting and a more prominent speed limit sign for southbound traffic. She said the road was recently paved and drivers speed past her neighborhood all the time.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t walk around here,\" said Romero. \"I lived around here, but I don\u2019t walk.\u201d\n\nCopyright 2015 Tucson News Now.
