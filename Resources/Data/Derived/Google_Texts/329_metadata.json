( Kerry Klein/KQED )\n\nAs expensive as medical care can be, it also costs a lot to die. Evangelina Quintanilla learned this a year ago when she lost her father, and again when her mother passed away in September.\n\nQuintanilla, a single mother of eight in Fresno, couldn\u2019t afford a funeral for either of her parents. She maxed out all her credit cards to pay for her father\u2019s services. Because she was still paying off those bills when her mother died a year later, she had to get creative \u2014 so she held a car wash.\n\nWashing cars for funeral donations is not uncommon in Fresno, where over a quarter of residents fall below the federal poverty level. Drive along the city\u2019s busiest boulevards on any weekend and you\u2019re bound to see groups of kids holding up brightly colored posters showing the names and faces of family members who died.\n\nAfter her mother\u2019s death, Quintanilla\u2019s first idea was to beg. \u201cWe were just going to go from place to place by asking 50 cents, 25 cents, 10 cents,\u201d she said. \u201cAnything was good.\u201d\n\nBut her sister had noticed people washing cars a few weeks earlier at a Central Fresno gas station. She urged Quintanilla to call and see if they could do the same. The owner said sure, but asked for a small fee and urged them to be frugal with water.\n\nSo Quintanilla and 20 or so family members set up folding chairs and lined up buckets of soapy water early on a Saturday morning in September. It was hot that day, over 90 degrees in the afternoon, and a light dusting of ash was blowing into the valley from the Rough Fire. It was a good day to find dirty cars \u2014 and a miserable day to be out in the elements.\n\nQuintanilla sat in a minivan while her children, cousins, aunts and uncles washed the pickup trucks and station wagons that rolled in. The 41-year-old is disabled; she has survived two strokes and suffers from high blood pressure and diabetes. Doctors have advised her not to work and warned her against exerting herself. \u201cI\u2019m like, \u2018OK, tell me what I need to do. I need to be here for my kids. Tell me.\u2019 \u201d\n\nMany of these same health problems led to the death of Quintanilla\u2019s mother. Just like her daughter, she suffered a string of chronic health issues, including diabetes. When she came down with a bad infection, her body ultimately couldn\u2019t fend it off. She was in the hospital for a month before she died of sepsis. Quintanilla wonders if her mother\u2019s fate could become her own. She says her brother jokes, \u201cYou\u2019re probably next.\u201d\n\nWhen she can, she thinks back to a happy memory of her mother. \u201cI never asked her age \u2019cause my mom used to tell people she was younger,\u201d she says, in a fit of laughter. \u201cMy mom was in her 60s but she said she was 50.\u201d\n\nBy about 4 p.m., Quintanilla says, they had washed around 75 cars and raised close to $600. But they still had a long way to go: Cremation services would cost at least $2,500. \u201cWe wanted to view her, but it costs more money,\u201d she says. \u201cEverything does.\u201d\n\nThey still probably made more money than they would have from begging. \u201cThe biggest donation we got was $150,\u201d she says, choking up. \u201cI think everybody\u2019s been generous.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Drive along the city\u2019s busiest streets on weekends and you\u2019ll see groups of kids holding up brightly colored posters showing family members who died.", "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"In Fresno, Car Washes Common Way to Pay for Funerals\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/2015\\/10\\/26\\/in-fresno-car-washes-common-way-to-pay-for-funerals\\/\",\"pub_date\":\"2015-10-26 13:00:30\",\"mod_date\":\"2015-10-26 17:05:09\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":98425,\"author_id\":\"8344\",\"author_name\":\"State of Health\",\"author_display_name\":\"State of Health\",\"tags\":[\"Health Costs\",\"News\"],\"categories\":[\"Community Health\"],\"image\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/sites\\/27\\/2015\\/10\\/CarwashFuneralFundraising.jpg\"}", "og": {"site_name": "State of Health", "description": "Drive along the city\u2019s busiest streets on weekends and you\u2019ll see groups of kids holding up brightly colored posters showing family members who died.", "title": "In Fresno, Car Washes Common Way to Pay for Funerals", "url": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/2015/10/26/in-fresno-car-washes-common-way-to-pay-for-funerals/", "image": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/wp-content/uploads/sites/27/2015/10/RS16910_IMG_2590-qut-400x300.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@kqedhealth", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@"}, "fb": {"app_id": 160023622793}, "keywords": "health costs,news", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "\u201cWe were just going to go from place to place by asking 50 cents, 25 cents, 10 cents,\u201d she said.\nEvangelina Quintanilla and her family wash cars in Central Fresno to help pay for her mother\u2019s cremation.\nQuintanilla, a single mother of eight in Fresno, couldn\u2019t afford a funeral for either of her parents.\n\u201cAnything was good.\u201dBut her sister had noticed people washing cars a few weeks earlier at a Central Fresno gas station.\nWashing cars for funeral donations is not uncommon in Fresno, where over a quarter of residents fall below the federal poverty level."}
