The man wanted in the stabbing death of a 60-year-old Berkeley County woman has been arrested in Charlotte, U.S. Marshals say.



Marshals arrested Lee Dell Bradley, 59, in a parking lot near Freedom Drive in Charlotte, Tuesday, according to a release from the U.S. Marshals service. Marshals say Bradley was taken into custody without incident and is being held in the Mecklenburg County Jail in North Carolina pending extradition back to South Carolina.



An arrest warrant for Bradley was issued Friday, the day after the body of his girlfriend, Frances Lawrence was found in her home, Berkeley County deputies say. Bradley had initially been named a person of interest in the case, and deputies said he may have left the scene driving Lawrence's vehicle, a dark blue Chevrolet Blazer with license plate number EJV-919, which was reported missing from the residence, according to sheriff's office spokesman Dan Moon.



Deputies responded shortly after 9 a.m. Thursday to Lawrence's home on Bush Lane in the Sheep Island area of Summerville where the woman's body was found. Berkeley County Coroner Bill Salisbury said Lawrence died of a single stab wound to the chest.



Lawrence's sister, Darlene Walker, says Lawrence hadn't shown up for work since Tuesday and believes Lawrence was killed some time after coming home from work.



"I knew something wasn't right, I just couldn't put my finger on it, and I mean, this happened right under our nose and we didn't even know it," Walker said.
