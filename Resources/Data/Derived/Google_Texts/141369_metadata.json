They may not read the same information about Obamacare that you read, and have failed to defund, but they know a thing or two about America. Heck, these are the people who pay your salary, your vacation time, your sick days, and your health and dental insurance. Without them, there is no Senator Ted Cruz.\n\nBack in the old days, Senators were elected into office to represent the people, not diminish their intelligence. You have failed as a Senator to accomplish anything for the people of the United States. You have not defunded Obamacare, you have not defeated ISIS, you did not stop the Omnibus bill, you haven't done, well, anything you promised.\n\nIf those 'low information voters' would just get out the way, you would be 'cruzin to victory' as they say.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Easy Teddy, 'Low Information Voters' Pay Your Salary - Justin Holcomb : Wow, what a strategic campaign tactic.\u00a0Much like his tactics in .05/26/2016 18:18:41PM EST.", "author": "Justin Holcomb", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/justinholcomb/2016/03/10/teddy-hits-trump-supporters-n2131517", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/uploads/2016/3/10/8.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Justin Holcomb  - Easy Teddy, 'Low Information Voters' Pay Your Salary"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/justinholcomb/2016/03/10/teddy-hits-trump-supporters-n2131517", "site_name": "Townhall", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/uploads/2016/3/10/8.jpg", "type": "Article", "title": "Justin Holcomb  - Easy Teddy, 'Low Information Voters' Pay Your Salary"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Easy Teddy, 'Low Information Voters' Pay Your Salary, Justin Holcomb , Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "If those 'low information voters' would just get out the way, you would be 'cruzin to victory' as they say.\nWithout them, there is no Senator Ted Cruz.\nHeck, these are the people who pay your salary, your vacation time, your sick days, and your health and dental insurance.\nThey may not read the same information about Obamacare that you read, and have failed to defund, but they know a thing or two about America.\nEasy Teddy, you just insulted people in Vermont, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Virginia, South Carolina, Nevada, Michigan, Hawaii, Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, Tennessee, and Kentucky."}
