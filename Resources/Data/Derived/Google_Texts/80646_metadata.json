NATO forces would face severe casualties even with available U.S. airpower being employed and could not stop the Russian advance, unless nuclear weapons were used.\n\nThe report\u2019s findings are as follows, \u201cAs Presently Postured, NATO Cannot Successfully Defend the Territory of its Most Exposed Members. Across multiple games using a wide range of expert participants in and out of uniform playing both sides, the longest it has taken Russian forces to reach the outskirts of the Estonian and/or Latvian capitals of Tallinn and Riga, respectively, is 60 hours. Such a rapid defeat would leave NATO with a limited number of options, all bad.\u201d\n\nThe only solution is a costly one; NATO (read the United States taxpayer) must fund and maintain approximately seven armored brigades with supporting forces. This will not be cheap, costing approximately $3.7 billion per year.\n\n\u201cIt Is Possible to Avoid Such Consequences. A force of about seven brigades,\n\nincluding three heavy armored brigades \u2014 adequately supported by airpower, land-based fires, and other enablers on the ground and ready to fight at the onset of hostilities \u2014 could suffice to prevent the rapid overrun of the Baltic states. While not sufficient to mount a sustained defense of the region or to achieve NATO\u2019s ultimate end state of restoring its members\u2019 territorial integrity, such a posture would fundamentally change the strategic picture as seen from Moscow,\u201d says the RAND report.\n\nThe cost of not doing so would be even higher, with the loss of allies and an even worse security situation in Europe that would threaten the West.\n\nLate last month, Gen. Philip Breedlove, commander of U.S. European Command, released a new strategy anticipating \u2014 and pushing back against \u2014 the call for more rotational forces. Flying troops in and out of the region \u201ccomplements\u201d the units who call Europe home, he wrote, but they\u2019re no \u201csubstitute for an enduring forward deployed presence that is tangible and real. Virtual presence means actual absence,\u201d reported Yahoo News.\n\nIn 2012, the Obama administration withdrew two brigades of heavy armor from Germany in another example of this administration failing to project American power to secure her national security and that of our allies.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll be here for Estonia. We will be here for Latvia. We will be here for Lithuania. You lost your independence once before. With NATO, you will never lose it again,\u201d Obama recently promised to the Baltic nations. This promise seems empty and suspect at current force levels.\n\nOnce again, it will be left to the next administration to rebuild America\u2019s defense posture in the face of global threats that have mushroomed under the Obama presidency under an abdication of American leadership.", "article_metadata": {"description": "On the same day the Secretary of Defense, Ash Carter, announced new resources being sought to strengthen Eastern European defenses from any possible Russian aggression, a report from the RAND corporation was released and states that with current force structure, Russia could overrun NATO defenses in the Baltics and be in Riga or Tallinn in under three days.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "On the same day the Secretary of Defense, Ash Carter, announced new resources being sought to strengthen Eastern European defenses from any possible Russian aggression, a report from the RAND corporation was released and states that with current force structure, Russia could overrun NATO defenses in the Baltics and be in Riga or Tallinn in under three days.", "title": "L.
