Humana shareholders will receive $125 cash plus 0.8375 shares of Aetna for each share of Humana. The companies will pay their respective dividends while the transaction, which is expected to close in the second half of 2016, is pending.\n\nManagement comments on the transaction\n\nShawn M. Guertin, Aetna\u2019s executive vice president and CFO, said, \u201cThe complementary nature of our two companies provides us with a significant synergy opportunity, furthering Aetna\u2019s efforts to increase its operating efficiency. We expect synergies from the transaction to be $1.25 billion annually in 2018. These cost efficiencies will support our efforts to drive costs out of the system and offer more affordable products.\u201d\n\nThe comments regarding affordability are critical, because the objection from the regulators will be that a small number of insurers could lead to higher prices. The companies will have to convince regulators that their merger will give consumers better service at lower prices.\n\nSpecific conditions\n\nThe following conditions need to be satisfied in order for the deal to close:\n\nHumana shareholder vote\n\nAetna shareholder vote\n\nSEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission) approval of joint proxy statement\n\nHart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act filing\n\nNon-solicitation agreement and breakup fee\n\nBoth companies have non-solicitation covenants with a fiduciary out. This means they aren\u2019t allowed to discuss merging with another company unless they receive a bona fide written proposal and the Board of Directors believes it could lead to a superior transaction.\n\nIf Humana accepts another bid, they will owe Aetna $1.3 billion. If Aetna gets a bid and dumps Humana, they will owe Humana $1.7 billion. If the regulators demand too much in the way of divestitures, Aetna can walk away from the transaction and must pay Humana $1 billion.\n\nOther merger arbitrage resources\n\nOther important merger spreads include the Hospira\u2013Pfizer deal. The Hospira (HSP) and Pfizer (PFE) merger is set to close in 2H15.
