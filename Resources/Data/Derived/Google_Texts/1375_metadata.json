The first experiment rated students \u2014 both MAC and PC users \u2014 on how well they drew the logo from their memory. They were measured on factors, such as the general shape and bite and leaf size. And the second experiment focused more on the levels of confidence students felt before and after drawing their logo.\n\nIn the first experiment, only one student drew Apple\u2019s logo perfectly; seven drew the logo with three or few mistakes; while the rest made mistakes. Prior to their drawing, researchers asked students to rate how confident they felt in the overall accuracy of their drawing. Perhaps unsurprisingly, MAC users were more confident than mixed and PC users. So it\u2019s no surprise students who reported feeling more confident drew a better version of the logo.\n\nBut there was a drop in this confidence when researchers tracked student levels in the second experiment; this time, only 26 undergrads were participating. They found a 55 percent drop in confidence from before they drew the logo to after they drew the logo.\n\nUltimately, these two experiments offer a deeper look into visual memory \u2014 and how people\u2019s memories may not be as accurate as they think.\n\n\u201cWe found that despite relatively poor recall and recognition, participants were somewhat confident with their performance in both tasks,\u201d researchers wrote. \u201cThe presence of this potential overconfidence is probably due to the fact that the logo is perceived to be relatively simple, pervasive, and memorable and is therefore believed to be recalled easily.\u201d\n\nResearchers added this may be a form of what\u2019s called attentional saturation. The Apple logo is everywhere, meaning people may stop paying attention to its minor details. Additionally, people may use an \u201cinferential process, such as \u2018if there is a leaf, there must be a stem.\u2019\u201d Participants following this process may have drawn what they thought the apple should look like versus what they remember it looks like.\n\nIn 1980, researchers called this the repetition effect after they found radio listeners learned very little after hearing several advertisements for one campaign. Researchers of this study concluded being repeatedly presented with material doesn\u2019t ensure encoding, the first step to create a new memory. Similarly, frequent exposure doesn\u2019t always lead to enhanced memory.\n\n\u201cIt follows that this probably extends to specific memory for other logos,\u201d present researchers concluded. \u201c\u2026Given the minimalistic and (seemingly) simple nature of the Apple logo, it may be that under intentional learning conditions, people could memorize and reproduce the logo.\u201d\n\nSource: Blake A., Nazarian M., & Castel A.
