Rep. Peter King said Thursday that he agrees with former House Speaker John Boehner's shocking assessment that Ted Cruz is "Lucifer in the flesh."

"I fully agree with John Boehner. Maybe it gives Lucifer a bad name by comparing him to Ted Cruz," King said in an interview with CNN's Wolf Blitzer Thursday afternoon.

King went on to blame Cruz for the government shutdown in 2013 and costing taxpayers money.

"Listen, what John Boehner was most concerned about was Ted Cruz perpetrated a fraud and a hoax when he brought about the shutdown of the government on some kind of a vague promise that he was gonna be able to take Obamacare out of the budget or to end Obamacare," King explained. He added that Cruz knew the government shutdown would never work, but did it for no reason "other than to boost his name identification."
