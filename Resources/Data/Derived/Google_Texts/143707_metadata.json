Those of us who were born here and chose to stay know that Santa Monica is one of the most beautiful environments anywhere in the world. In Santa Monica we are soothed by soft ocean breezes, we always have a close-by spot to look out over the ocean or watch the sunset, to have space, to gain peace.\n\nYet there has been a lot of anger and frustration vented recently about our city\u2019s shortcomings: too little space for the deluge of traffic that comes in and goes out of the city daily, tall buildings going up that block the sun and the fresh air coming off the water, rising home and apartment prices that prohibit all but the elite from moving into our neighborhoods.\n\nMany interests want a piece of that natural beauty that is Santa Monica. Arguments have divided neighbors, city officials, developers and business owners. We who live in Santa Monica do care deeply about our city, and that\u2019s why our residents have had to step up time and again through our city\u2019s history to save that elusive \u201cpeace\u201d that permeates our surroundings. Now we all need to work together once again to find common ground for preserving what we already have, that which makes our city shine. Think about the things you love about Santa Monica. How can we make sure they remain for future generations?\n\nOur SMa.r.t. group did just that and here is the Thanksgiving potpourri of ideas that came to mind:\n\n\u201cI\u2019m thankful that this city has so many citizens willing to serve officially and to participate in countless ways of making our lives better. I do not agree with all of them all the time but their willingness to serve and participate rebounds to all our benefit.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am thankful to own a house in a city that has become too expensive for many. I know that I am one of the lucky ones who was able to build my house before it became too costly to do so.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am grateful for the growing and energetic commitment of aroused residents in pursuing and demanding a quality environment, and who show foresight in addressing problems and meeting goals for social equality and sustainability.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am grateful that we have our beach and ocean that gives us the opportunity to breathe fresh air and enjoy unfettered views to forever.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am thankful that my city has groups of neighbors who have banded together into neighborhood associations and preservation organizations to protect our quality of life, such as the Santa Monica Conservancy and the Historic San Vicente Coalition.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am thankful to share my city with the world in the summer but even more thankful to have it back in the fall, winter and spring.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am thankful for our many and varied small neighborhoods. I especially enjoy walks up Montana Avenue and the families I see doing the very same thing, and meeting someone, as I did yesterday, who was visiting from Spain. And I\u2019m grateful for the wonderful conversations and exchanges of ideas that arise from these chance meetings.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am thankful that our city is capable of producing more than its share of affordable housing.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m grateful for Heal the Bay which keeps the health of our beach and ocean in the public forefront.\u201d\n\n\u201cI love that we have classic, timeless, varied and unique restaurants such as Chez Jay, The Galley, Melisse and the original Hot Dog on a Stick.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am grateful that we have a community of residents that seek to preserve our fresh air and sunshine, and who fight to resist the few power brokers that would change our unique quality of life.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am thankful for the rich tapestry of the arts in Santa Monica \u2014 for organizations such as the Ruskin Theatre, The Santa Monica Symphony Orchestra, Santa Monica Playhouse, Beautify Earth\u2019s murals and other public art, and so much more.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am thankful to live in a City where the residents care as much about their urban and natural environment as I do.\u201d\n\n\u201cI applaud all the service groups in Santa Monica whose members give their time and donations to help others in need.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am thankful that because of our residents\u2019 resistance of large scale high rises and their work towards preservation of existing housing, our town maintains a rich diversity of population.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am grateful for easy walking access to our Palisades Park and the magnificent vistas it provides of the sand, the Pacific Ocean and the always colorful sunsets.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am thankful for our great public education system \u2014 all the excellent elementary and middle schools leading students to Samohi, and our rapidly growing secondary institution, Santa Monica College.\u201d\n\n\u201cI love that we have extraordinary public parks, playgrounds, sports fields, skate parks and swimming pools to keep our bodies and minds sharp, and most of all to have great fun. We need more of these.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m grateful for all the tourists who help keep our economy very healthy and add even more to the diversity of the daily experience in our city, and I hope they love Santa Monica as much as we do.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am thankful to be living in a place where normal citizens can talk to government and attempt to influence its course, without repercussion. I\u2019m also very glad to be surrounded by folks who have committed ethics, and are willing to act to make this a better place.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m thankful for Santa Monica\u2019s great library system.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am thankful for the generosity and camaraderie of my neighbors and fellow citizens who sacrifice their time and energy to preserve the unique qualities of our City for all to enjoy.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am thankful for our new city manager who brings a fresh outlook to our community \u2013 a manager whose varied background has led him to realize that it\u2019s human-scaled design and spaces, not flashy buildings, that create a quality environment.\n\n\u201cI am thankful to be cooled by the ocean breezes in summer, warmed by the temperate climate in winter and powered by the sun all year long.\u201d\n\nHappy Thanksgiving!\n\nPhil Brock for SM.a.r.t (Santa Monica Architects for a Responsible Tomorrow)\n\nRon Goldman FAIA, Thane Roberts AIA, Architect, Robert H.
