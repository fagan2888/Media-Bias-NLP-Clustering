The penalty grows this year to two percent or $325 per person.\n\nTo qualify for the special enrollment period, consumers must say they aren\u2019t currently enrolled in coverage, pay the 2014 penalty and state they didn\u2019t know about the penalty until they filed 2014 tax returns, said Andy Slavitt, principal deputy administrator for the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, during a Friday call with reporters.\n\nHealthcare.gov has a new tool to help people to find out if they are eligible for an exemption from the penalty. Exemptions are available if a person has various hardships such as filing for bankruptcy, had a family member die, or was a victim of domestic violence\n\nThe administration already gave a short extension to Feb. 22 for people already in line get health insurance when the Feb. 15 deadline passed.\n\nThe administration declined to offer estimates on how many people will sign up. The Treasury Department has estimated that 6 million people will have to pay for a penalty.\n\nOfficials also admitted to an error in the tax form sent out to 800,000 people who purchased insurance under healthcare.gov. The form had the wrong benchmark for healthcare premiums, which are used to calculate the credits.\n\nSlavitt said that 95 percent of those people haven\u2019t filed their tax returns yet and will receive new forms. He emphasized the error, the cause of which is still unknown, won\u2019t affect the vast majority of tax filers.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Obama administration will open enrollment in healthcare.gov again from March 15 to April 30 for uninsured people who will have to pay a penalty under the law\u2019s individual mandate.\nThe announcement Friday comes in response to calls from Democrats and health advocates to re-open enrollment, which ended on Feb. 15, as most people affected by the penalty may not know they have to pay it.
