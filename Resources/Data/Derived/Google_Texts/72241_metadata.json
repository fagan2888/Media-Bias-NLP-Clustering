Whether or not Liz and Eric, the couple portrayed in this episode, actually experienced such a condition isn\u2019t entirely certain, but it certainly opens questions as to whether the idea of an \u201cextended orgasm\u201d is a real medical concern for women (or men).\n\nTLC claims the stories they broadcast are true. \u201cWe\u2019ve found real-life couples that have experienced everything from continuous orgasms to fractured penises,\u201d TLC writes on its website. \u201cWatch as they retell their astonishing stories while reenactments show how the injury occurred.\u201d\n\nThe couple, who live in Seattle, had been having sex before work when Liz\u2019s orgasm, which normally lasts about 15 seconds, did not stop. \u201cI started hopping up and down to see if that would do anything,\u201d Liz says on the show. \u201cI started trying to drink wine to see if that would calm down my system. I tried just about every possible thing I could do to stop having an orgasm.\u201d It was after two hours that they rushed to the ER, where it was another hour before she was relieved of the seemingly endless climax.\n\nSo what is an \u201cextended orgasm\u201d? The term was coined by Patricia Taylor, a coach and author, in 1995. Taylor had focused her Ph.D. research on the sensual experiences of 44 different couples, and was interested in finding ways to meld sex with spiritual experiences or revelations by introducing modalities that could help extend pleasure. Thus Taylor\u2019s term \u201cextended orgasm\u201d is associated more with using sexual practices to manually extend the sensation, rather than it being a medical condition that is uncontrollable. So Liz\u2019s condition might not be quite the same as an \"extended orgasm.\"\n\nPersistent Genital Arousal Disorder\n\nHowever, there is indeed an actual medical condition called persistent genital arousal disorder or PGAD or PSAS, which causes consistent and uncontrollable genital arousal in women without sexual desire. It\u2019s a rare condition where the victim experiences orgasms every few hours or sometimes more frequently, which severely impairs their daily lives and normal functioning, and even prevents them from having intimate relationships. They can have up to fifty or more in a row. PSAS was documented in 2001, so not much research has been done to effectively understand the condition or treat it properly. It is usually associated with extreme sensitivity, and can be aggravated by feelings of pain and discomfort. Eventually, the women who suffer from this condition associate orgasms more with pain than pleasure.\n\nAnd though TLC\u2019s \u201cSex Sent Me to the ER\u201d is meant to be comedic, some real stories aren\u2019t as lighthearted.\n\nOne woman, Gretchen Molannen, who had suffered from PSAS for 16 years, committed suicide after her inability to find relief from the pain. \u201cThe arousal won\u2019t let up,\u201d she said in a hearing, according to CBS News. \u201cIt will not subside. It will not relent. One O-R-G will lead you directly into the horrible intense urge, like you\u2019re already next to having another one. \u2026 And you\u2019re in so much pain. You\u2019re soaking in sweat. Every inch of your body hurts.\u201d\n\nIn a 2012 study, researchers actually found that most women with PSAS had the presence of a Tarlov cyst at their sacral spine \u2014 which some doctors believed could have caused vertebrae to press against nerves on the spinal cord and contribute to their condition. However, not enough research has been done on this particular condition, or the three-hour orgasm of Liz in \"Sex Sent Me to the ER,\" for doctors to be certain.\n\n\u201cThink of what it would be like to be like continuously on the verge of sneezing, say, or with a full bladder and nothing to do about it,\u201d Dr. Barry Komisaruk, a psychology professor at Rutgers University and a sexual medicine researcher, told CBS News. \u201cThe women are really tormented by it\u2026 If there was more general knowledge about it, I think more women would discuss it with their doctor,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "orgasm, extended orgasm, persistent genital arousal disorder, sex", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "A woman was rushed to the ER in a panic after her orgasm, which usually lasts about 15 seconds, didn't stop for over three hours.", "title": "Woman Experiences Orgasm For 3 Hours, Rushed To ER", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/woman-experiences-orgasm-3-hours-rushed-er-it-real-condition-266426", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/01/06/bedroom.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A woman was rushed to the ER in a panic after her orgasm, which usually lasts about 15 seconds, didn't stop for over three hours.", "title": "Woman Experiences Orgasm For 3 Hours, Rushed To ER", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/woman-experiences-orgasm-3-hours-rushed-er-it-real-condition-266426", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/01/06/bedroom.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/01/06/bedroom.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Conditions", "published_time": "2014-01-06T16:07:12-05:00", "modified_time": "2014-01-06T16:07:11-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "A woman was rushed to the ER in a panic after her orgasm, which usually lasts about 15 seconds, didn't stop for over three hours."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fddbfe\"", "article_summary": "So what is an \u201cextended orgasm\u201d?\nTLC has just released a new clip from its series, \u201cSex Sent Me to the ER,\u201d which shows a woman experiencing an orgasm for over three hours, panicking, and rushing to the ER before it diminishes.\nSo Liz\u2019s condition might not be quite the same as an \"extended orgasm.\"\nThus Taylor\u2019s term \u201cextended orgasm\u201d is associated more with using sexual practices to manually extend the sensation, rather than it being a medical condition that is uncontrollable.\nAnd though TLC\u2019s \u201cSex Sent Me to the ER\u201d is meant to be comedic, some real stories aren\u2019t as lighthearted."}
