They manhandled Massachusetts in their home opener. They came from behind to beat rival Colorado State last week in overtime, and Saturday they destroyed an FCS opponent that hasn\u2019t won in almost two years.\n\nNelson Spruce became CU\u2019s all-time leader in pass receiving yardage and the Buffs beat Nicholls State 48-0 to forge their first three-game winning streak since 2008 and their first shutout since 2009. Now Pac-12 play looms with games against conference foes on nine consecutive weekends, beginning with 13th-ranked Oregon here next Saturday night in a nationally televised game.\n\nAll the suspense was gone by halftime, including Spruce\u2019s pursuit of Michael Westbrook\u2019s record for receiving yardage. Spruce passed Scotty McKnight (2,521), Rae Carruth (2,540) and then Westbrook (2,548) with an 11-yard reception in the second quarter, finishing the game with five catches for 80 yards. He now stands at 2,570 for his career.\n\n\u201cWe played physical in this football game, we played hard, we were able to put it away so we could rest some of those guys in the second half,\u201d said coach Mike MacIntyre, already fielding questions about next week. \u201cOregon has a lot of speed. We\u2019re going to have to be able to tackle the speed.\u201d\n\nThe Buffs cruised to a 24-0 halftime lead despite several high throws by quarterback Sefo Liufau, who separated his right shoulder last week in the Rocky Mountain Showdown. Liufau reluctantly conceded he threw Saturday with pain.\n\n\u201cPretty frustrating,\u201d said Liufau, who has not thrown an interception since the first quarter of the Hawaii game. \u201cI left a lot of throws out there. I don\u2019t want to make any excuses. If you\u2019re out there playing, you need to make the plays. I think fundamentals was what it comes down to, and trying to compensate for (the shoulder).\u201d\n\nMacIntyre said Liufau wasn\u2019t able to throw in practice for most of the week, and his long passes were sailing early.\n\n\u201cThen he figured it out and started throwing them a little bit lower and doing better,\u201d MacIntyre said. \u201cHe was out of rhythm just a little bit, but he did a lot of excellent things and he\u2019ll feel much better next week.\u201d\n\nPhillip Lindsay rushed for 133 yards on 17 carries and scored twice. He, too, was playing with pain after injuring a rib in the CSU game.\n\n\u201cI got my rib banged up pretty bad,\u201d Lindsay said.\n\nSo, about that Oregon game, coach.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s just enjoy this one right now,\u201d MacIntyre said. \u201cSpeed, speed, speed worries you about Oregon. They\u2019ve got a lot of speed, all over the field. They\u2019ve been the class of the Pac-12 for a while, them and Stanford. They\u2019re a really good football team.\u201d\n\nJohn Meyer: jmeyer@denverpost.com or @johnmeyer\n\nGame balls\n\nPhillip Lindsay, RB, CU: Rushed for 113 yards and two touchdowns on 17 carries.\n\nDonovan Lee, RB, CU: A former wide receiver, Lee ran over three Nicholls State defensive players and scored on a 59-yard run in the third quarter.\n\nJered Bell, S, CU: Made a nice interception in the second quarter and picked off a bad overthrow in the fourth quarter.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Colorado wins easily against FCS foe in final nonconference game", "title": "Colorado wins easily against FCS foe in final nonconference game", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/09/26/colorado-wins-easily-against-fcs-foe-in-final-nonconference-game/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150926__nelson-spruce-colorado-DPp1-1.jpg", "height": 460}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150926__nelson-spruce-colorado-DPp1-1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-09-26T14:42:26+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-21T21:44:34+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "University of Colorado"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd31ee\"", "article_summary": "\u201cSpeed, speed, speed worries you about Oregon.\nJered Bell, S, CU: Made a nice interception in the second quarter and picked off a bad overthrow in the fourth quarter.\nSo, about that Oregon game, coach.\nThey came from behind to beat rival Colorado State last week in overtime, and Saturday they destroyed an FCS opponent that hasn\u2019t won in almost two years.\nSpruce passed Scotty McKnight (2,521), Rae Carruth (2,540) and then Westbrook (2,548) with an 11-yard reception in the second quarter, finishing the game with five catches for 80 yards."}
