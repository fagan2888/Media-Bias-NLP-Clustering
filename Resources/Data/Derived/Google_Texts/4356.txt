Intermountain Medical Center.

Intermountain Healthcare Chief Executive Officer Charles W. Sorenson will retire in October 2016, the Utah-based system announced on Monday, after spending 17 years as an executive for the celebrated healthcare provider.

He first joined the Committee in 1998 as executive vice president and chief operating officer and was named president and CEO in 2009.

After he retires, Sorenson will take on a new role within Intermountain as the founding director of a new Healthcare Leadership Institute, which will be home to the Institute for Healthcare Delivery Research developed by Brent James, MD, Intermountain's chief quality officer. Participants in the Institute will get the chance to learn alongside Intermountain professionals and provide leadership training for physicians and other staff looking to broaden their current roles.

His colleague, Intermountain Board Chair and CEO of Zions First National Bank Scott Andersen, applauded Dr. Sorenson's legacy of "advancing [the organization's] local, national and international reputation as an industry leader in evidence-based medicine."

"Intermountain...has been cited as an example of how to do things right by leaders as politically diverse as President Barack Obama and former presidential candidate, Mitt Romney," he said in a statement.

Sorenson, 64, also practices urologic surgery, focusing primarily on oncology. A national search will be conducted for Sorenson's replacement, the organization said.
