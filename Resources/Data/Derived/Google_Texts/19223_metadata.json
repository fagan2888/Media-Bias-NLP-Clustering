Five Arizona residents were among 24 Americans who were invited to sit in first lady Michelle Obama's box for the State of the Union address. The White House identifed them as: \u2022 Cristian Avila, Phoenix, immigration advocate and voter engagement coordinator \u2022 Joey Hudy, Anthem, high school inventor and self-described \"maker\" \u2022 Cory Remsburg, an Army Ranger who was wounded in Afghanistan, and his father and caretaker, Craig Remsburg, a businessman, both of Phoenix \u2022 Amanda Shelley, Gilbert, physician assistant and Obamacare enrollee See related story: GOP lawmakers dislike the 'how' as much as the 'what' of Obama's speech\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 When she got a call Friday inviting her to come to the White House and meet with first lady Michelle Obama, Gilbert resident Amanda Shelley \u201cthought I was being pranked by my friends.\u201d\n\nBut the call was for real and Shelley was one of five Arizona residents scheduled to sit with the first lady in the Capitol Tuesday evening to watch President Barack Obama deliver his sixth State of the Union address.\n\nThe five Arizonans made up a disproportionate share of the 24 Americans invited to join Mrs. Obama because they \u201cexemplify the themes and ideals laid out in the State of the Union,\u201d according to the White House announcement of the guest list.\n\nThe Arizona residents included a wounded soldier and his dad from Phoenix, an inventive high school student from Anthem, a Phoenix resident who went on a hunger strike to push for immigration reform and Shelley, a physician\u2019s assistant who was able to get health insurance under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThey were joined by a group that ranged from business executives to elected officials, teachers to firefighters, survivors of the Boston Marathon bombing to one of the first openly gay players in the National Basketball Association.\n\nInviting special guests to the State of the Union is a tradition going back to the administration of President Ronald Reagan, said Towson University political science professor Richard Vatz in an emailed statement.\n\n\u201cIt is invariably to make a political point and to make certain issues and perspectives salient to the viewing audience,\u201d Vatz said.\n\nWhile it\u2019s traditional for first ladies to invite such issue-related guests, it it not typical to see \u201cfive different families or five different individuals from one state being invited,\u201d said Dave Wakeman, principal of the Wakeman Consulting Group.\n\nHe agreed that guests are in the gallery to \u201cput real names and faces\u201d to issues that will be highlighted.\n\n\u201cSince there are five Arizonans invited, that leads me to believe that President Obama is going to \u2026 push one of two issues: comprehensive immigration reform and/or the successes that the Affordable Care Act has begun having on Arizona families,\u201d Wakeman said in an email.\n\nThose topics are important to at least two of the Arizona guests.\n\nCristian Avila, for example, was on a hunger strike on the National Mall with a group of immigration reform advocates when they were visited by the Obamas in November.\n\n\u201cThe first lady and the president were genuinely concerned for us,\u201d Avila said Tuesday in Washington. \u201cIt was like they weren\u2019t just our president and first lady, it was like they were our father and mother.\u201d\n\nThe Phoenix resident, who ended his fast after three weeks, said he\u2019s still getting over a cold he caught during the fast. But he was \u201chonored to be one piece of something much greater\u201d and said he looked forward to Obama giving the issue of immigration reform \u201cmore of a face from his speech.\u201d\n\nShelley is a success story about the Affordable Care Act, which didn\u2019t have many successes in its early going last year. She said a pre-existing medical condition had made it difficult for her to get health insurance but, after some struggles with the healthcare marketplace website, she was finally able to enroll and get coverage on Jan. 1.\n\nWithin days, that coverage was put to the test.\n\n\u201cI started having stomach pains on the third\u201d of January, said Shelley, who usually avoided medical treatment because she lacked coverage. Worried that her health care enrollment might not have been successful, she called \u201cjust to make sure I was covered\u201d and was assured that she was.\n\nShelley wound up in the emergency room the next day and was undergoing surgery two days after that. When National Public Radio did a brief interview with her, it got the attention of the White House, which called her Friday.\n\nShe was invited to tour the White House, attend a reception with Mrs. Obama and, finally, sit in the first lady\u2019s box for the president\u2019s speech to Congress Tuesday, when Shelley said she hopes to the rollout of the Affordable Care Act will continue to be trumpeted.\n\n\u201cI was frustrated in the beginning. But I was patient and tried again,\u201d Shelley said of her experience. \u201cEveryone who had a hard time needs to try it again. It\u2019s worth it.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "index.html", "image": "http://cronkitenews.asu.edu/assets/images/13/11/22-fast-avila-lead.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "WASHINGTON \u2013 When she got a call Friday inviting her to come to the White House and meet with first lady Michelle Obama, Gilbert resident Amanda Shelley \u201cthought I was being pranked by my friends.\u201d But the call was for real and Shelley was one of five Arizona residents scheduled to sit with the first [...]", "title": "Five Arizonans among 24 people sitting with first lady for State of the Union"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9088\"", "article_summary": "Five Arizonans among 24 people sitting with first lady for State of the UnionMrs. Obama requests the honor...
