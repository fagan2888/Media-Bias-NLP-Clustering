Not the car, an actual horse. Well now you can.\n\nThe Federal Bureau of Land Management\u2019s latest adoption effort is in Lorton this weekend and is meant to help contain the burgeoning population of mustangs and burros in the western United States.\n\nFriday, a dozen people adopted 20 wild horses and 24 burros from the Meadowood Recreation Area.\n\nAccording to Inside NOVA:\n\nThe 1971 Wild-Free Roaming Horses and Burros Act gave the BLM the authority to manage wild horses and burros, by protecting the free-roaming animals and removing \u201cexcess animals from the range to control the size of herds,\u201d BLM officials said. BLM estimates that, as of February 2013, they were managing at least 40,605 free-roaming wild horses and burros, and more than 48,000 wild horses and burros in short-term corrals or long-term pastures.\n\nSince 1971, the BLM program has gotten 230,000 wild horses and burros adopted out. All adopters need to do is be over the age of 18, fill out an application and proof of a corral or shelter in which the animals can live. Adoption fees start at only $125.\n\nThe Washington Post reported:\n\nFor Kimberly Loveless, a horse lover and trainer from Fredericksburg, the difference between owning a wild horse and a domesticated horse is patience. Loveless has adopted five mustangs and is a volunteer for the program. Wild horses, which rarely have any human contact in nature, are generally terrified of people, she said, and it takes considerable time to gain their trust. But for Loveless, befriending a wild animal has been one of the most rewarding experiences of her life. \u201cJust to see some of the horses when they\u2019re wild \u2014 nobody\u2019s brushed them, nobody\u2019s trimmed their manes and nobody\u2019s cleaned them up \u2014 if you can just kind of look past that and see what\u2019s in their eyes and what\u2019s in their faces, you know, and maybe find something special about one of them, it\u2019s worth every bit of your time and effort,\u201d Loveless said.\n\nHowever, the program has received some opposition in the past. Animal rights activists maintain that these creatures should stay in their natural habitat, untouched by humans.\n\nAnne Novak, executive director of Protect Mustangs, isn\u2019t necessarily against adoption, but feels the government misrepresents the need to remove mustangs from their natural habitat, and she questions the agency\u2019s head count of animals as well as its estimate of how many horses the land can support.\n\n\u201cIf they were able to gather the number of horses that they adopt out annually, then there wouldn\u2019t be this problem,\u201d she said. \u201cThey need to reestablish a fair allocation of public land to the wild horses who legally have a right to it.\u201d\n\nWild-Free Roaming Horses and Burros Act of 1971 protects these creatures from harm and capture, but also permits the government to remove \u201cexcess animals\u201d if they are damaging an environment.\n\nThe adoption event continues today from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. at the Meadowood Recreation Area.", "article_metadata": {"home_name": "Washington D.C.", "geoLat": "38.807", "description": "Ever wanted to own a mustang?
