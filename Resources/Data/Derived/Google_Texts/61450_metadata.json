Neighborhood Health is the only Nashville-area program to receive this funding; other programs funded in Tennessee are in Knoxville and Memphis.\n\nThis award will enable individuals and families in Lebanon, Wilson County and the surrounding area to have access to the affordable, quality health care that Neighborhood Health currently provides in Davidson County and Trousdale County.\n\nServices will include comprehensive preventive and primary care provided by a physician and nurse practitioner. A licensed behavioral health provider will also provide counseling.\n\nMary Bufwack, CEO of Neighborhood Health, said that Lebanon was chosen because there are a large number of uninsured residents and no community health center in Wilson County. Lebanon is a town of 28,000; about 15,000 are low income and more than 6,000 are uninsured.\n\nBufwack noted, \u201cA clinic serving those who are low income can have a significant impact on the health of the county. 38.7 percent of adults in the county have high blood pressure and more than 12 percent report having been diagnosed with diabetes.\u201d\n\nThe nearest community health center which targets services to those who are uninsured and underserved is the Neighborhood Health clinic in Hartsville, on Damascus Ave. Other community clinics are in Davidson County over 30 miles away.\n\nA projected 2,500 individuals will be served annually. The clinic will be open by September 2015. Services will be provided with payments discounted based on family size and income. TennCare and other insurance are accepted. Services will not be denied because of inability to pay.", "article_metadata": {"copyright": "Copyright(c) Sandusky Newspapers, Inc.", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Sandusky Newspapers, Inc.", "og": {"site_name": "Hartsville Vidette", "description": "Affordable Care Act provides funding for new site", "title": "Neighborhood Health to open Lebanon clinic", "url": "http://www.hartsvillevidette.com/article/health-lifestyle/301231", "image": "http://www.hartsvillevidette.com/sites/www.hartsvillevidette.com/files/styles/thumbnail/public/Mary_Bufwack.jpg?itok=CnUpWpHs", "type": "article"}, "MSSmartTagsPreventParsing": "true", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0; maximum-scale=1.0; user-scalable=0;"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2191\"", "article_summary": "Neighborhood Health has received $495,000 in Affordable Care Act funding to develop a clinic in Lebanon.\nMary Bufwack, CEO of Neighborhood Health, said that Lebanon was chosen because there are a large number of uninsured residents and no community health center in Wilson County.\nThis award will enable individuals and families in Lebanon, Wilson County and the surrounding area to have access to the affordable, quality health care that Neighborhood Health currently provides in Davidson County and Trousdale County.\nNeighborhood Health is the only Nashville-area program to receive this funding; other programs funded in Tennessee are in Knoxville and Memphis.\nThis grant is part of a national initiative that is funding 164 new community health centers with funds totaling $101 million."}
