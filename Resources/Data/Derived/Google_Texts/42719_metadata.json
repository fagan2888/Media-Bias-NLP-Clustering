In most instances today, a person cannot claim he didn\u2019t know what he was doing was illegal. But the House\u2019s proposal would require government to \u201cprove that the defendant knew, or had reason to believe, the conduct was unlawful.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe House language violates the basic precept that \u2018ignorance of the law is no defense,\u2019\u201d Robert Weissman, the president of Public Citizen, told the Huffington Post. \u201cThere is absolutely no reason for the otherwise laudable criminal justice reform bill to contain any measure to weaken already feeble standards for corporate criminal prosecution.\u201d\n\nActually, in the ways Washington works, there is every reason to expect that the GOP would include pro-corporate fine print in the reform package. This is legislation both parties want passed before the 2016 elections. Meanwhile, right-wing think tanks funded by corporate titans such as the anti-regulation Koch brothers have been doing what they\u2019re paid to do\u2014issuing papers urging Congress to toughen the requirements to get a white-collar conviction.\n\nThey argue, much like the civil rights community, that prosecutors have too much power and too readily abuse it. However, a key distinction between the racial justice agenda and the corporate agenda is that civil rights activists are primarily focused on police and prosecutorial abuses of the criminal justice codes, whereas the corporate community is primarily focused on government regulations of industry. They are shrewdly saying that people who make mistakes should be punished, but by fines or other penalities\u2014not criminal convictions that last a lifetime.\n\n\u201cSome people or entities intentionally pollute our air and water or intentionally engage in other conduct knowing it will cause harm, in which case criminal prosecution may be entirely appropriate,\u201d John Malcolm, Heritage Foundation\u2019s judicial and legal studies director, wrote this fall. \u201cHowever, if somebody or some entity unwittingly does something that results in harm, say, to the environment or to another person, there is no reason why it cannot be dealt with (even harshly) through the administrative or civil justice systems. This would help to remedy the problem and compensate victims without saddling morally blameless individuals and entities for life with a criminal conviction.\u201d\n\nMalcolm\u2019s paper and argument reviews a range of varying standards of proof that would be required for a conviction. They range from the toughest on perpetrators to the loosest, starting with a person could be accused of \u201cnegligently\u201d commiting a crime. The spectrum continues with \u201crecklessly,\u201d \u201cknowingly,\u201d \u201cintentionally,\u201d and finally, \u201cwillfully.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "If the plutocrats have their way, a new bill will make it even more difficult to prosecute white-collar criminals", "title": "The Kochs, loathsome to the end: The real reason they\u2019re interested in criminal justice reform", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "If the plutocrats have their way, a new bill will make it even more difficult to prosecute white-collar criminals", "title": "The Kochs, loathsome to the end: The real reason they\u2019re interested in criminal justice reform", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/11/22/take_a_wild_guess_as_to_why_the_koch_brothers_got_so_interested_in_criminal_justice_reform_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/11/charles_koch.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "If the plutocrats have their way, a new bill will make it even more difficult to prosecute white-collar criminals", "title": "The Kochs, loathsome to the end: The real reason they\u2019re interested in criminal justice reform", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/11/charles_koch.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Steven Rosenfeld", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, AlterNet, aol_on, criminal justice reform, Koch Brothers", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "\u201cThere is absolutely no reason for the otherwise laudable criminal justice reform bill to contain any measure to weaken already feeble standards for corporate criminal prosecution.\u201dActually, in the ways Washington works, there is every reason to expect that the GOP would include pro-corporate fine print in the reform package.\nIn most instances today, a person cannot claim he didn\u2019t know what he was doing was illegal.\nThey range from the toughest on perpetrators to the loosest, starting with a person could be accused of \u201cnegligently\u201d commiting a crime.\nThey are shrewdly saying that people who make mistakes should be punished, but by fines or other penalities\u2014not criminal convictions that last a lifetime.\nHowever, a key distinction between the racial justice agenda and the corporate agenda is that civil rights activists are primarily focused on police and prosecutorial abuses of the criminal justice codes, whereas the corporate community is primarily focused on government regulations of industry."}
