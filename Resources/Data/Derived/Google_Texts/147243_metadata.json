None were able to do what 'QHMO' could do,\" said Carol Sorrell, Chief Operating Officer of Bakersfield Family Medical Group, in Bakersfield, California. \"The other applications were either far too cumbersome, or simply were unable to mimic the nurses' daily workflow. We found 'QHMO' on the other hand much easier to use, mimicked nurses' tasks, and really focused on coordinating the health care of the patient, not simply checking a bunch of boxes on computer forms.\"\n\n\"We noticed that many organizations have been loath to embrace the Affordable Care Act's move from payment for volume to payment for value,\" said Dr. Richard Merkin, President and CEO of HPN. \"We are hopeful that 'QHMO' will help organizations more readily embrace a changing future. Too many are hopeful that nothing will change, or that even if things change any such change will be incremental, when what we need is a wholesale change in the way we think about the provision of healthcare in the United States. We need to move from a sick care system to a well care system. 'QHMO' can help accomplish just such a change and make the critical difference.\"\n\nABOUT HPN:\n\nHeritage Provider Network, Inc. (HPN) is on the cutting edge of the accountable care model of healthcare delivery: coordinated, patient-doctor centric, integrated health care systems that represent the future of health care in the United States. HPN and its affiliates operate in California, New York and Arizona providing high quality, cost effective healthcare to close to one million individuals and are dedicated to quality, affordable health care, and putting patients' wellness first.
