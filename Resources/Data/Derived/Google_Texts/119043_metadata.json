He wished on each one and prayed to God. He could see rescuers searching, but they didn\u2019t see him.\n\nIn the morning, he made his move.\n\nGowan, 19, explained how he survived Wednesday afternoon at Riverview Medical Center. He was in a wheelchair, hooked to an IV and a heart monitor, flanked by doctors who treated him for scratches and cuts on his arms, dehydration and a condition in which muscles break down.\n\nHe spent Tuesday afternoon riding a friend\u2019s WaveRunner near Highlands. His friend drove the water craft to Brooklyn and ran out of gas. Gowan took his friend\u2019s car to Brooklyn, gave him fuel, took over the WaveRunner and aimed homebound at 6:30 p.m.\n\nIt was the first time he had tried this water route. Google Maps shows it\u2019s about 11 miles between Highlands and Brooklyn at the closest points. Gowan estimated closer to 20.\n\nHe didn\u2019t take his cellphone because the waterproof compartment on the WaveRunner was broken, and he didn\u2019t expect the worst to happen.\n\nLeaving Brooklyn, he hit a wave, crashed down hard and fell off. But he didn\u2019t think he hit anything.\n\nHe got back on and kept going.\n\nAbout four miles off the shore of Sandy Hook, the WaveRunner started to bog down.\n\nIt sounded like it was going to shut off.\n\nHe kept running it until the engine quit, and he started sinking. He thinks there was damage to the hull.\n\nHe opened the back seat to see water pouring in. It became unstable, and Gowan jumped in the water.\n\nHe took off his sweat pants, took off his life jacket and tried to swim to shore.\n\nBut the current was heading out. He was getting exhausted.\n\nThe ocean claimed two lives in the past week, not far from where Gowan was stranded.\n\nA missing swimmer\u2019s body washed up on Sandy Hook Friday.\n\nA swimmer caught in a rip current at Sea Bright died the day after he was pulled from the surf.\n\nGowan is an emergency medical responder for Highlands and Sea Bright, and a junior Sea Bright firefighter. He\u2019s been taught water rescue and swimming techniques.\n\nHe paused to rest, clinging to a crab pot buoy, then paddled to a channel marker tower and climbed up.\n\nHe doesn\u2019t know how much time passed, but he saw U.S. Coast Guard boats and helicopters.\n\nHe could see rescuers from the New York Police Department.\n\nHe climbed to the top of the light and waved and yelled, but couldn\u2019t get their attention. He was in the one place no one looked.\n\n\u201cI could see everyone looking for me, but I couldn\u2019t reach out to them,\u201d he said.\n\nHe climbed back down and tried to light a fire using batteries on the tower. But it was too windy.\n\nHe dismantled two boxes to shield himself from the wind. He couldn\u2019t sleep, but he laid down.\n\nAt dawn, he went to the bottom of the channel marker to check the tide. Four or five sailboats and a clamming boat passed by him.\n\nHe yelled and screamed and waved, but they couldn\u2019t see him.\n\nHe thought if he were back in the water he\u2019d be easier to spot.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s either: do I want to sit here and die? Or do I want to make the effort?\u201d\n\nHe jumped into the water and swam toward shore.\n\nHe didn\u2019t think he\u2019d make it, but he saw boats and thought he might get someone\u2019s attention.\n\nHis arms and legs burned as he swam.\n\nIn about 20 to 30 minutes, he saw a Coast Guard boat, but they didn\u2019t see him.\n\nHe yelled, screamed at the top of his lungs, waved his arms, splashed as much as possible.\n\nThey spotted him.\n\nThree officers helped him aboard, and Gowan broke down in tears. He hugged an officer.\n\nGowan was taken back to Coast Guard\u2019s Sandy Hook station. The National Park Service and his first aid squad checked him out. He was a relieved to see people he knew.\n\nHe was taken to Riverview Medical Center in Red Bank, where he was aggressively treated for rhabdomyolysis. Stephanie Reynolds, director of the hospital\u2019s emergency room, explained that\u2019s a condition in which muscles break down, releasing proteins that could damage the kidneys and throw off potassium levels, which impacts heart rhythm.\n\nHe said when he leaves the hospital, he\u2019ll take some of his friends from the first aid squad out to Sandy Hook to see the tower where he spent a night.\n\n\u201cI was praying to God that I\u2019d just be able to give my mom a hug again,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s all I really wanted.\u201d\n\nAndrew Ford: 732-643-4281; aford3@gannettnj.com\n\nDon't miss a thing Download our apps and get alerts for local news, weather, traffic and more.
