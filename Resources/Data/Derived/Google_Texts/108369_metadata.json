The same thing they want from movies: drama, comedy, sex, slapstick, glamour and romance.\n\nOf course, no single movie can do all that. No wonder the perfect Oscarcast is an impossible dream. No wonder so many previous Oscarcasts failed to measure up.\n\nA perfect broadcast would include Roberto Benigni scrambling over auditorium seats to claim his trophy (1998), an onstage streaker (1974), Cher in a collection of outrageous get-ups, a rematch between 2008 rivals James Cameron and ex-wife Kathryn Bigelow, that deliciously awful 1988 musical number with Rob Lowe and \u201cSnow White,\u201d more of Jack Palance\u2019s one-armed pushups from beyond the grave, plus the stirring acceptance speech by Halle Berry in 2002.\n\nNot gonna happen. We\u2019ll just have to make do when the 87th annual Academy Awards show airs Sunday at 8 p.m. EST on ABC. Besides counter-programming on other networks, here\u2019s what the Oscarcast is up against this year:\n\nSURE SHOT\n\nEveryone loves a blockbuster or two landing best-picture nods. It gets people talking and tuning it. But this year, big hits like \u201cInterstellar\u201d and \u201cThe Lego Movie\u201d were snubbed, with the nominees almost uniformly \u201csmall\u201d pictures \u2014 with the exception, of course, of \u201cAmerican Sniper,\u201d whose box-office firepower in recent weeks has caught everyone off guard and triggered hero-or-killer disputes about its protagonist.\n\nEven so, the favorites appear to be \u201cBirdman\u201d and \u201cBoyhood,\u201d both terrific films that may not be such conversation starters. To handicap their Oscar chances with your friends, you first have to find someone else who has seen them.\n\n___\n\nWHITER SHADE OF PALE\n\nProcol Harum should be named this year\u2019s Oscar house band. As you may have noticed, there\u2019s not much diversity among the nominees. Will the contenders\u2019 pallor cast a pall on viewership, or will the uproar over the Academy\u2019s single-mindedness prod movie fans to tune in and witness what they see as Oscar\u2019s sins of omission?\n\n___\n\nIS THE HOST TOAST?\n\nNeil Patrick Harris is so talented and versatile other entertainers would probably endorse slapping a restraining order on him. Meanwhile, viewers clearly love him, and why wouldn\u2019t they? On the other hand, he\u2019s hosted the Tonys four times and the Emmys twice. Isn\u2019t there someone else out there, maybe with new tricks up his or her sleeve, who could shake things up beyond Harris\u2019 dependable excellence?", "article_metadata": {"description": "What makes an Oscarcast click?
