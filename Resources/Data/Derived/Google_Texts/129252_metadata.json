While making one of his bombastic boasts during that first Republican debate last month, he described the country's pay-to-play system of politics with welcome candor.\n\n\u201cI will tell you that our system is broken,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI gave to many people before this \u2014 before two months ago I was a businessman. I give to everybody. When they call, I give. And you know what, when I need something from them two years later, three years later, I call them. They are there for me. That\u2019s a broken system.\u201d\n\nYup, that\u2019s how it works all right. If you give, you get. The Koch Brothers, labor unions, the Sheldon Adelsons and Trump himself donate millions, even billions, to advance candidates. They want access and influence. And they get it.\n\nThat is a central reason for the builder\u2019s current popularity: Supporters claim he\u2019s so wealthy he will be immune to special interests. And his serial outrageous statements \u2014 and his aggressive rejection of \u201cpolitical correctness\u201d \u2014 play neatly into the same theme: He\u2019s so wealthy, so independent, he just doesn\u2019t give a damn.\n\nIt makes theoretical sense: With money having taken over politics, maybe the answer is a man so rich he can\u2019t be bought.\n\nA comparison with another multi-billionaire who entered politics \u2014 Michael R. Bloomberg \u2014 might be instructive. He made the same argument Trump is making now when he left the company he founded to run for mayor in 2001.\n\nHe would be nobody\u2019s toady, he said. He wouldn\u2019t be obligated to the many lobbyists who push and pull at elected officials as if they were pieces of taffy \u2014 special interests ranging from the powerful teachers unions and the health-care industry to the city\u2019s many racial and ethnic factions.\n\nThey are forces to contend with, pressuring even candidates who count on the city's public financing system, which limits contributions and spending. (Bloomberg opted out, which freed him to spend as much of his own money as he wanted.)\n\nThat freedom to do the right thing, the entrenched powers be damned, was central to Bloomberg\u2019s appeal , and it fuels him still in nationwide and global crusades for gun control and public health.\n\nWould Trump be the same if, and the mind reels at the thought, he won the White House? The easy guess: No. One person\u2019s independence is another\u2019s bludgeon.\n\nLove him or hate him, Bloomberg was rooted. Though free of the typical political obligations, he was not free of a sense of responsibility to New York. That came from within. He knew who he was: a reasonable guy who had made good, who was chronically impatient with bureaucratic stupidity and willing to delegate to strong lieutenants.\n\nHis most audacious innovations during his first term: to widely expand the city\u2019s smoking ban and centralize control of the schools under the mayor after years of governance by a discredited political committee. Important, but hardly shocking.\n\nLess similar than they seem (Sabo, Robert/New York Daily News)\n\nBloomberg\u2019s got an ego, of course \u2014 he built a financial-services and media conglomerate with his name all over it. He\u2019s willful, impatient and has a crass sense of humor. But he\u2019s always seemed guided by an inner compass.\n\nTrump has rather different ideas: building walls at borders, uprooting 11 million immigrants (never mind how), bombing \u201cthe hell\u201d out of Mideast oilfields to strike at ISIS, overturning Obamacare.\n\nBloomberg infuriated many New Yorkers with his stop-and-frisk policy, his fondness for development, his failure to deal with a disastrous detention system.\n\nBut compare that with describing Mexican immigrants as rapists, equating attending military school with serving in the armed forces, being pro-choice one day, pro-life another. You can\u2019t.\n\nNo two people could be less alike. Bloomberg, who grew up in a striving middle-class family that instilled strong altruistic values in him, is a self-made success who ultimately (kicking and screaming) recognized the importance of restraint.\n\nTrump, who grew up privileged and got a jump-start from his wealthy developer father, has no second gear. Trump so revels in Trump, it\u2019s a wonder he doesn\u2019t have his name tattooed on his forehead beneath that glowing pompadour.\n\nBloomberg and Trump are two sides of the very expensive coin. Bloomberg was free to institute tough reforms without petty pandering; Trump feels freer than anyone to offend or pander to whomever he wants, brazenly, and assumes he will suffer no repercussions.\n\nIt\u2019s time voters who admire Trump for his money realize that the answer to a broken political system is not just a super-rich guy. What matters is not the size of a candidate\u2019s bank account but who that person fundamentally is.\n\nWith apologies to the late Lloyd Bentsen: Donald Trump, you are no Mike Bloomberg.\n\nPurnick, a former metro editor and columnist at the New York Times, is author of \u201cMike Bloomberg: Money, Power, Politics.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Joyce Purnick", "twitter": {"description": "You\u2019ve got to hand it to Donald Trump (yes, you read that right).", "title": "Joyce Purnick: Why Bloomberg trumps Trump", "url": "http://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/joyce-purnick-bloomberg-trumps-trump-article-1.2357732", "image": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2357730.1442013018!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/nup-113012-0388.jpg", "site": "@nydailynews", "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.tags": "trump, Bloomberg,", "parsely-author": "Joyce Purnick", "parsely-type": "article", "keywords": "trump, Bloomberg,", "nydn_tags": "mike bloomberg, donald trump", "news_keywords": "trump, Bloomberg,", "parsely-link": "http://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/joyce-purnick-bloomberg-trumps-trump-article-1.2357732", "parsely-title": "Joyce Purnick: Why Bloomberg trumps Trump", "sailthru.date": "2015-09-13T04:15:00-0400", "sailthru.title": "Joyce Purnick: Why Bloomberg trumps Trump", "nydn_section": "Opinion", "parsely-pub-date": "2015-09-13T08:15:00", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2357730.1442013018!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/nup-113012-0388.jpg", "description": "You\u2019ve got to hand it to Donald Trump (yes, you read that right).", "robots": "NOARCHIVE", "fb": {"admins": 1594068001, "app_id": 107464888913, "pages": 268914272540}, "msvalidate.01": "02916AAC0DA8B068EFE01D721E03ED7E", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/NYDailyNews/"}, "sailthru.description": "You\u2019ve got to hand it to Donald Trump (yes, you read that right).", "viewport": "width=device-width, height=device-height, initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no", "parsely-section": "Opinion", "og": {"site_name": "NY Daily News", "description": "You\u2019ve got to hand it to Donald Trump (yes, you read that right).", "title": "Joyce Purnick: Why Bloomberg trumps Trump", "url": "http://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/joyce-purnick-bloomberg-trumps-trump-article-1.2357732", "image": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2357730.1442013018!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/nup-113012-0388.jpg", "type": "article"}, "parsely-tags": "mike bloomberg, donald trump", "parsely-image-url": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2357730.1442013018!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/nup-113012-0388.jpg", "p": {"domain_verify": "78efe4f5c9935744af497772f68a0ee7"}, "nydn_byline": "Joyce Purnick", "sailthru.credits": "NEW YORK DAILY NEWS"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd485a\"", "article_summary": "Purnick, a former metro editor and columnist at the New York Times, is author of \u201cMike Bloomberg: Money, Power, Politics.\u201d\nIt\u2019s time voters who admire Trump for his money realize that the answer to a broken political system is not just a super-rich guy.\nTrump so revels in Trump, it\u2019s a wonder he doesn\u2019t have his name tattooed on his forehead beneath that glowing pompadour.\nWith apologies to the late Lloyd Bentsen: Donald Trump, you are no Mike Bloomberg.\nBloomberg and Trump are two sides of the very expensive coin."}
