That all changed with the entrance of 401 (K) plans, which were cheaper for employers to manage and put employees in the driver seat when it comes to where their money goes.\n\nNow that Obamacare is in year two and the employer mandate kicks in, requiring companies with more than 50 full-time employees to offer health insurance or face a fine, experts are predicting more companies will adopt a defined contribution health benefits model.\n\n\u201cEmployers want to be competitive and have an excellent workforce. This helps them offer an important benefit at a more predictable cost,\u201d says Greg Pane, a former state health and Medicaid director. \u201cEmployees and consumers may experience increased cost sharing but expanded choice and more personal responsibility for managing their health care.\u201d\n\nContinue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT\n\nWith the employer mandate all businesses with more than 50 full-time workers have to provide health insurance or pay a per month so-called \u2018employer shared responsibility payment\u2019 on their federal tax return. Small businesses with 50 to 99 full time workers have until 2016. Those with a 100 or more employees will have to start providing health benefits to at least 70% of their full time employees by 2015 and 95% by 2016.\n\nWith a defined contribution health benefits plan an employer would give its workers a set amount of money for them to buy health insurance in the private marketplace. Employees would either get a lump sum or be reimbursed each month for the amount spent on premiums. Employees would not only be able to choose a plan that works for them but it should also drive competition which could mean lower premiums. According to Lindquist, companies that offer this model and employees who use it can expect to save 20% to 60% on their annual health insurance costs. In fact Lindquist estimates families of four can save $4,000 to $12,000 a year to access the same doctors and hospitals and use the same prescription medicine.\n\nCurrently a whole swath of companies are offering choice when it comes to health insurance. In fact, Zane Benefits\u2019 Lindquist says the company has over 3,000 businesses set up to offer healthcare as a defined contribution.\n\nWhile it may seem like a no brainer for employees, it\u2019s not something they can take advantage of unless the employer offers it. That\u2019s why Lindquist says it\u2019s important for employees to suggest it to their employer and hopefully get them to listen. It\u2019s not a stretch considering the state of the current healthcare insurance industry and the countless personal bankruptcies that can be squarely blamed on outrageous medical expenses. If the company declines the suggestion, Lindquist says employees should do some comparison shopping on the health exchanges to see if they are over-paying with their company plan. If that turns out to be the case they can ask their employer to drop their coverage and pay them a little bit more to make up for the out of pocket expenses, says Lindquist.\n\nThe way healthcare insurance is currently structured employees at all-size companies are being treated like \u201cchildren,\u201d adds Mitch Rothschild, chief executive of Vitals.com, which matches patients with doctors. That\u2019s because employees are asked to purchase insurance without knowing the price and quality of the plan, let alone if it makes sense for the individual or his or her family. By giving employees the power of choice, he predicts health insurance will start to become simpler and provide workers with more selections. \u201cA healthy 27 year-old and a 55 year-old diabetic are going to want different health plans with different doctors and deductibles,\u201d says Micth. \u201cWhy should it be one size fits all as long as the two employees are getting the same amount of money?\u201d", "article_metadata": {"classification": "/FOX BUSINESS/INDUSTRIES/Health Care,/FOX BUSINESS/HEALTH CARE", "dcterms.modified": "2016-01-08 01:25:14 EST", "dcterms.abstract": "More choices for employees as more companies offer defined contribution health benefits.", "twitter": {"url": "http://www.foxbusiness.com/features/2014/11/25/defined-contribution-health-benefits-future.html", "image": "http://a57.foxnews.com/images.foxnews.com/content/fox-business/features/2014/11/25/defined-contribution-health-benefits-future/_jcr_content/par/featured-media/media-0.img.jpg/0/0/1452277521724.jpg?ve=1", "description": "More choices for employees as more companies offer defined contribution health benefits.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Defined Contribution Health Benefits the Future?"}, "dc.format": "text/html", "dc.publisher": "Fox Business", "parsely-metadata": "{\"tags\":[\"/FOX BUSINESS/INDUSTRIES/Health Care\",\"/FOX BUSINESS/HEALTH CARE\"],\"author\":\"Donna Fuscaldo\",\"subSection\":\"features\",\"title\":\"Defined Contribution Health Benefits the Future?\",\"image_url\":\"http://a57.foxnews.com/images.foxnews.com/content/fox-business/features/2014/11/25/defined-contribution-health-benefits-future/_jcr_content/par/featured-media/media-0.img.jpg/0/0/1452277521724.jpg?ve=1\",\"pub_date\":\"2014-11-25T15:00:42Z\",\"link\":\"http://www.foxbusiness.com/features/2014/11/25/defined-contribution-health-benefits-future.html\",\"type\":\"article\",\"identifier\":\"b4e8dbfe-8e93-4116-9e7b-634bcb91ad6e\",\"section\":\"features\"}", "prism.aggregationType": "subsection", "prism.channel": "fbn", "dc.description": "More choices for employees as more companies offer defined contribution health benefits.", "dc.identifier": "b4e8dbfe-8e93-4116-9e7b-634bcb91ad6e", "dc.language": "en-US", "pagetype": "article", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://global.fncstatic.com/static/cq/fb/img/all/mediumtile.png", "classification-isa": "healthcare,healthcare", "description": "More choices for employees as more companies offer defined contribution health benefits.", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://global.fncstatic.com/static/cq/fb/img/all/widetile.png", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://global.fncstatic.com/static/cq/fb/img/all/smalltile.png", "prism.section": "features", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://global.fncstatic.com/static/cq/fb/img/all/largetile.png", "fb": {"app_id": 116027085089150}, "dc.source": "FOXBusiness", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "dc.title": "Defined Contribution Health Benefits The Future?", "dcterms.created": "2016-01-08 01:25:14 EST", "og": {"site_name": "Fox Business", "description": "More choices for employees as more companies offer defined contribution health benefits.", "title": "Defined Contribution Health Benefits the Future?
