No safety check? No insurance? No license plate? No problem.

That’s according to a group of Big Island residents who think they have a constitutional right to travel without state and federally imposed licensing, registration and safety checks.

On Jan. 2, the group will ring in the new year with a drive to demonstrate that independence.

“We will be planning the route so we do it in a safe and courteous way, but we’re here to make an impact,” said Paul Komara, one of the event’s organizers.

Dubbed the “Freedom Ride 2016,” it will be the first such event for the group. Komara said he has no idea what the turnout will be.

“Please join us as we tour the Big Island as free people, lawfully demonstrating our ‘right to travel’ without the encumbrance of state property license plates,” reads a flier put out by the group.

Participants have the option of replacing their plates with a notice of personal ownership signifying the vehicle is not for hire. That’s because the right to travel by private conveyance for private purposes cannot be infringed, according to the group.

No license or permission is required for travel that is not for commercial profit, said Bradley Belmarez, in an email. Belmarez is one of the organizers covering North Hawaii.

“There are only requirements for registration, insurance and license for commercial drivers,” he said. “Not travelers.” As for swapping out license plates, “that’s a personal decision,” he said.

The organizers of the Big Island effort held an orientation, question-and-answer session and sign-up recently at the University of Hawaii at Hilo. The departure time, place and route for the rally has yet to be decided.

Asked if the Hawaii Police Department would cite out-of-compliance vehicles in the rally, spokeswoman Chris Loos said in an email that police will continue to enforce all traffic violations. For information, contact Komara at 936-5929.
