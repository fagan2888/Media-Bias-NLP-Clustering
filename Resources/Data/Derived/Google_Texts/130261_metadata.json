Ryan have been moving on divergent tracks in 2016, with Mr. Trump staking out a populist stance on economic issues and immigration, even as Mr. Ryan has pushed House Republicans to build a more conventionally conservative platform.\n\nThose differences will be highlighted Thursday when Mr. Trump meets with Mr. Ryan and his House leadership team.\n\nBut they see common ground when it comes to unraveling President Obama\u2019s 2010 health law, where members of Congress hope to use Mr. Trump to sell their alternative to voters.\n\nSo far, Mr. Trump has not gone into detail on what he would do on health care. Congressional Republicans, meanwhile, have a number of different options, but have been unable to settle on a single alternative.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a good issue, he just needs to come up with a repeal and replacement plan. He\u2019s going to have give specifics,\u201d said Sen. Lindsey Graham, South Carolina Republican who tussled with Mr. Trump during his own bid for the presidency.\n\nHe feels Mr. Trump hasn\u2019t done that yet, but \u201cin fairness to him, a lot of Republicans haven\u2019t.\u201d\n\nHouse Republicans plotted their next steps Wednesday, holding a hearing searching for ideas on how to scrap Obamacare in favor of a GOP plan that relies on market incentives and health savings accounts that put patients in charge of their health dollars.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re six years into the president\u2019s health care law, and it\u2019s not working the way people thought it might,\u201d Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Fred Upton, Michigan Republican, said.\n\nHe said GOP members have \u201cdozens and dozens of ideas\u201d to shift away from Obamacare\u2019s mandates and coverage requirements, such as allowing states to subsidize pools of high-risk consumers with pre-existing medical conditions, instead of Obamacare\u2019s use of an individual mandate to prod healthy people into the market.\n\nCommittee Democrats said the GOP\u2019s ideas aren\u2019t needed. Roughly 20 million Americans have gained coverage under the law, leading to a historic reduction in the uninsured rate, and supporters think the law\u2019s web-based exchanges will stabilize over time, as insurers get a handle on pricing for their customer base.\n\n\u201cI believe the ACA has been a success,\u201d Rep. Frank Pallone, New Jersey Democrat, said.\n\nFor her part, Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton said she wants to build on Obamacare\u2019s reforms. Yet she has been pulled to the left by her rival, Sen. Bernard Sanders, a self-described Democratic socialist from Vermont who is pushing for a government-run, single-player health system.\n\nMrs. Clinton recently offered support for a government-run plan, or \u201cpublic option,\u201d that would compete with private plans on the Obamacare exchanges. The idea died off during the Obamacare debate in 2009-2010, after conservative Democrats threaten to block the bill unless it was taken out.\n\nRepublicans are banking on voters to reject Mrs. Clinton\u2019s pitch and flock to a new approach, warning consumers will face rising costs on Obamacare\u2019s exchange this fall.\n\n\u201cIt will be the November surprise for many people across this country,\u201d Sen. John Barrasso, Wyoming Republican, told reporters this week. \u201cAnd while Hillary Clinton wants to build on Obamacare, many, many Americans want it repealed and replaced.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Congressional Republicans have a lot of questions about how their agenda will square with that of presumptive presidential nominee Donald Trump, but they say one area where they and the billionaire businessman are on the same page when it comes to repealing and replacing Obamacare.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Congressional Republicans have a lot of questions about how their agenda will square with that of presumptive presidential nominee Donald Trump, but they say one area where they and the billionaire businessman are on the same page when it comes to repealing and replacing Obamacare.", "title": "Donald Trump, congressional Republicans share common ground in repealing Obamacare", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/may/11/donald-trump-congressional-republicans-share-commo/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2016/05/09/united_states_election_countdown.jpeg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2016/05/09/united_states_election_countdown.jpeg", "description": "Congressional Republicans have a lot of questions about how their agenda will square with that of presumptive presidential nominee Donald Trump, but they say one area where they and the billionaire bu", "card": "summary", "title": "Donald Trump, congressional Republicans share common ground in repeali"}, "Author": "Tom Howell Jr.", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Politics"}, "article_summary": "Those differences will be highlighted Thursday when Mr. Trump meets with Mr. Ryan and his House leadership team.\nMr. Trump and House Speaker Paul D.
