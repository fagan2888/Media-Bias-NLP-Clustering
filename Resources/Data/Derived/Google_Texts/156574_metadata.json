Truman.\n\nUntil Mr. Obama, John F. Kennedy had the lowest victory rate since World War II, winning 58 percent of his cases. Ronald Reagan had the highest success rate among modern presidents, with 73 percent. Mr. Obama\u2019s supporters attribute his record to an ideologically conservative court, while opponents say it stems from what they call the president\u2019s aggressive abuses of power.\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. Obama\u2019s more recent predecessors have struggled with the court. Bill Clinton lost a 9-to-0 decision when he tried to delay a sexual harassment lawsuit by a former Arkansas state worker until after his presidency, a lawsuit that ultimately led to the disclosure of his liaisons with Monica Lewinsky and his impeachment for perjury and obstruction of justice.\n\nThe Supreme Court ordered the end of recounts in Florida that cleared the way for George W. Bush\u2019s ascension to the presidency, but after he took office the justices rejected his broad interpretations of his executive power to hold terror suspects at Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Cuba, without judicial review and to try them before military commissions.\n\nMr. Obama has made his defeats into a public issue, taking his argument onto the campaign trail and chastising the justices in person at a State of the Union address for their ruling in the Citizens United campaign finance case. In publicizing that his administration had made no backup plans if his health care plan were struck down, critics said he was essentially trying to pressure the court, an interpretation his advisers reject.\n\nMr. Obama has experienced the court in three distinct phases \u2014 teaching constitutional law for 12 years at the University of Chicago, voting on Supreme Court nominees for four years as a senator and selecting nominees and litigating cases for seven years as president.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cWhen Obama taught at Chicago and when I got to know him, he was a believer in the role of the court maintaining our constitutional system and protecting constitutional rights,\u201d said Prof. Geoffrey R. Stone, a colleague at the university. \u201cBut he was always pretty moderate in his views. He was not someone who was a strong judicial activist.\u201d\n\nMr. Obama expressed reservations about the activism of Chief Justice Earl Warren\u2019s court, although he supported its liberal rulings on segregation and civil rights. \u201cHis view was that the Warren court was too active for his taste,\u201d Professor Stone said.\n\nIn his 2006 book, \u201cThe Audacity of Hope,\u201d Mr. Obama suggested the left would have been better off winning battles in the electoral arena. \u201cI wondered if, in our reliance on the courts to vindicate not only our rights but also our values, progressives had lost too much faith in democracy,\u201d he wrote.\n\nStill, in a 2007 speech, he said compassion, not just the letter of the law, should come into play. \u201cWe need somebody who\u2019s got the heart, the empathy, to recognize what it\u2019s like to be a young teenage mom,\u201d he said. \u201cThe empathy to understand what it\u2019s like to be poor or African-American or gay or disabled or old. And that\u2019s the criteria by which I\u2019m going to be selecting my judges.\u201d\n\nHe argued the Senate had every right to block a president\u2019s choices, even by filibuster. \u201cBecause federal judges receive lifetime appointments and often serve through the terms of multiple presidents, it behooves a president \u2014 and benefits our democracy \u2014 to find moderate nominees who can garner some measure of bipartisan support,\u201d he wrote in his book.\n\nPhoto\n\nHe voted against the confirmation of Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and supported a filibuster against Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. that ultimately failed. From the vantage point of a president whose own nominations are subject to filibuster, Mr. Obama has come to regret his support for the Alito filibuster, his spokesman said recently.\n\nBut conservatives see his focus on empathy as code for steering cases based on desired outcomes. \u201cOn matters that he really cares about, there\u2019s no meaningful difference between his political views and his constitutional views,\u201d said M. Edward Whelan III, president of the Ethics & Public Policy Center and a former Scalia clerk. In effect, \u201cthe empathy standard that he\u2019s used in nominating justices is just camouflage for judicial lawlessness.\u201d\n\nMr. Obama in recent years has dropped the word \u201cempathy\u201d but has found other ways of expressing the sentiment. In a post last week on Scotusblog, a website that tracks the Supreme Court, Mr. Obama said he wants a justice who interprets the law and does not make it.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut some decisions, he added, \u201cwill be shaped by his or her own experience, ethics and judgment.\u201d Justice, he added, \u201cis not about abstract legal theory, nor some footnote in a dusty casebook. It\u2019s the kind of life experience earned outside the classroom and the courtroom.\u201d\n\nMr. Obama has had two chances until now to reorient the court through his nominations of Justices Sonia Sotomayor in 2009 and Elena Kagan a year later.\n\n\u201cHe approached this in a very lawyerly, kind of scholarly way,\u201d recalled Cynthia Hogan, who as a White House lawyer helped direct the process. \u201cHe was looking for someone who was going to be supersmart and approach the law in a reasonable way.\u201d\n\nIndeed, he disappointed some of his liberal supporters who were looking for more firebrand choices, a Justice Scalia for the left. Justices Sotomayor and Kagan have both turned out to be reliable votes for the liberal wing of the court. But because they replaced two retiring liberals, Justices David H. Souter and John Paul Stevens, their appointments merely cemented those seats for years to come rather than shifting the balance of the court.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure there are any important cases that have been decided since Sotomayor and Kagan joined the court that wouldn\u2019t have turned out the same way had Souter and Stevens stayed on the court,\u201d Professor Stone said. \u201cSo in that sense he hasn\u2019t really changed anything. He\u2019s kept the same balance in place.\u201d\n\nThat is why the fight over Justice Scalia\u2019s replacement is so momentous, magnified because two of the most significant initiatives of Mr. Obama\u2019s presidency, on immigration and climate change, are awaiting the eventual judgment of a court now ideologically divided 4 to 4.\n\n\u201cThis one is different,\u201d Professor Stone said. \u201cObviously, the opportunity to replace Scalia is the first time he\u2019s had a chance to affect the balance on the court. And historically, it\u2019s potentially a very important appointment.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20160228174334, "twitter": {"description": "President Obama\u2019s current standoff with the Senate over replacing Justice Antonin Scalia is a struggle over not just the law, but power and his own legacy.", "title": "Obama\u2019s Tangled History With Supreme Court Sets Stage for Nominee Fight", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/29/us/politics/obamas-tangled-history-with-supreme-court-sets-stage-for-nominee-fight.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000004235829"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "creator": "peterbakernyt", "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/02/29/us/29obama-web/29obama-web-thumbLarge.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/29/us/politics/obamas-tangled-history-with-supreme-court-sets-stage-for-nominee-fight.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000004235829", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/29/us/politics/obamas-tangled-history-with-supreme-court-sets-stage-for-nominee-fight.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "us/politics", "hdl_p": "Past Court Duels Influence Obama", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/politics/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "Feb. 28, 2016", "edt": "NewYork", "org": "Senate", "keywords": "Obama  Barack,Supreme Court (US),Senate,Appointments and Executive Changes,Presidents and Presidency (US)", "news_keywords": "Senate", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Peter Baker", "SCG": "politics", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "per": "Obama, Barack", "thumbnail_150_width": 150, "byl": "By PETER BAKER", "thumbnail_150_height": 150, "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "President Obama\u2019s current standoff with the Senate over replacing Justice Antonin Scalia is a struggle over not just the law, but power and his own legacy.", "tom": "News", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "CT": "spotlight", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/02/29/us/29obama-web/29obama-web-thumbStandard.jpg", "description": "President Obama\u2019s current standoff with the Senate over replacing Justice Antonin Scalia is a struggle over not just the law, but power and his own legacy.", "CN": "great-reads", "CG": "us", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "Feb. 28, 2016", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "News", "article": {"author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/b/peter_baker/index.html", "section_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/section/us", "section": "Politics", "modified": "2016-02-29", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/politics/index.jsonp", "tag": "Presidents and Presidency (US)", "published": "2016-02-28", "section-taxonomy-id": "23FD6C8B-62D5-4CEA-A331-6C2A9A1223BE"}, "thumbnail_height": 75, "slug": "29obama", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20160229150210, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/29/us/politics/obamas-tangled-history-with-supreme-court-sets-stage-for-nominee-fight.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/02/29/us/29obama-web/29obama-web-facebookJumbo.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "President Obama\u2019s current standoff with the Senate over replacing Justice Antonin Scalia is a struggle over not just the law, but power and his own legacy.", "title": "Obama\u2019s Tangled History With Supreme Court Sets Stage for Nominee Fight"}, "pdate": 20160228, "des": "Presidents and Presidency (US)", "nyt-collection": {"tone": "feature", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/great-reads", "tagline": "Our best deeply reported and engaging works.", "uri": "/spotlight/great-reads", "display-name": "Great Reads", "identifier": "great-reads", "type": "spotlight"}, "articleid": 100000004235829, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "Obama\u2019s Tangled History With Supreme Court Sets Stage for Nominee Fight", "thumbnail_150": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/02/29/us/29obama-web/29obama-web-thumbLarge.jpg", "PST": "News"}, "article_summary": "In his 2006 book, \u201cThe Audacity of Hope,\u201d Mr. Obama suggested the left would have been better off winning battles in the electoral arena.\nIn a post last week on Scotusblog, a website that tracks the Supreme Court, Mr. Obama said he wants a justice who interprets the law and does not make it.\nUntil Mr. Obama, John F.
