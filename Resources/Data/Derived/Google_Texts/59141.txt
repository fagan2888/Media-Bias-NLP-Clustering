HOUSTON (AP) - Indianapolis quarterback Andrew Luck was inactive on Thursday night against the Houston Texans because of a right shoulder injury.

It will be the second straight game Luck has sat out after not missing a game in his career before last week.

Matt Hasselbeck will start in his place in a matchup of AFC South foes. The 40-year-old Hasselbeck threw for 282 yards with one touchdown in a 16-13 overtime win over the Jaguars on Sunday. Josh Johnson will be Hasselbeckâ€™s backup.

Inactive for the Texans are receivers Nate Washington (hamstring) and Cecil Shorts (shoulder).
