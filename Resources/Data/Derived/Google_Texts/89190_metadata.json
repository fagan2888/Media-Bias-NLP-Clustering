Credit: Wisconsin Troopers Association & Newaygo County Sheriff\u0092s Office\n\nBy of the\n\nOfficials from local, state and federal law enforcement agencies are meeting this week to talk about improving communication after a Wisconsin state trooper's murder this year, Marinette County Sheriff Jerry Sauve said.\n\nMarinette County is where serial bank robber Steven Snyder began his March 24 crime rampage, robbing a Wausaukee bank and stealing a bank employee's car before killing a truck driver named Thomas Christ.\n\nSnyder then drove to Fond du Lac and ambushed Wisconsin State Patrol Trooper Trevor Casper, who was following him while waiting for backup to arrive. Both men were killed in the shootout.\n\nSauve said he didn't learn about Snyder \u2014 or the threat he posed \u2014 until after Christ was killed.\n\n\"I learned about it at the scene of the homicide and I'm like, 'What the hell is going on here?' We should have that information,\" Sauve said Saturday. \"We didn't know what we were facing. We sure didn't know we had a guy like that.\"\n\nSauve said the goal of the meeting, scheduled for Thursday, is not to point fingers but to provide an opportunity for a \"law enforcement debriefing\" and talk about improving the sharing of information and coordination between agencies. The sheriff said officials with the FBI and the state Department of Justice would attend.\n\n\"I hope in the future we can get information faster, and work toward doing better,\" Sauve said.\n\nOfficials with the FBI and state DOJ could not be reached for comment Saturday.\n\nInvestigated in Michigan\n\nSnyder had been under investigation by the Newaygo County Sheriff's Department and the FBI in Michigan since about March 13. That's when Stacey Snyder, his estranged wife, called the sheriff's office there and said her husband was responsible for a string of unsolved bank robberies.\n\nFive days before his Wisconsin crime spree, the western Michigan Sheriff's Department was granted \"real-time GPS tracking\" for Snyder's cellphone, a report released Thursday by Fond du Lac District Attorney Eric Toney said.\n\nBefore Snyder robbed the bank in Wausaukee that day, a special agent with the state's DOJ learned from the FBI that cellphone tracking information showed a bank robbery suspect believed to be driving a rented car had crossed into Wisconsin.\n\nSnyder has since been linked to a string of at least nine bank robberies dating back to 2011.\n\nSauve added that he isn't \"up in arms\" but wants to make sure his agency has all the information it needs should a similar situation unfold in the future.\n\nHe isn't the only official who voiced concern about cooperation between law enforcement agencies on that tragic day. The report from Toney, the Fond du Lac district attorney, suggested some confusion between agencies across states when it came to tracking Snyder's cellphone.\n\nBut Leonard Peace, an FBI spokesman in Milwaukee, said Friday that \"there were no issues with lack of cooperation\" between the FBI resident agencies in Green Bay and Traverse City, Mich.\n\nThe technology for \"real time\" tracking of Snyder's cellphone wasn't available, Peace added, meaning officials couldn't find his specific location.\n\nPeace also said that any delays were due to information being passed from the Michigan Sheriff's Department to the FBI and on to the Wisconsin State Patrol.\n\n\"People were trying to move as quickly as they could,\" Peace said.\n\nDocuments released Thursday by the Wisconsin DOJ portray Snyder as a survivalist and extremist who spoke frequently of death and predicted he would probably die in a gunfight during a \"shootout with the cops.\"\n\nCasper, 21, who was on his first solo shift the day he was murdered, has been widely praised as a hero for his actions that day.", "article_metadata": {"title": "Agencies seek to improve coordination after trooper's murder", "og": {"url": "http://www.jsonline.com/news/crime/agencies-seek-to-improve-coordination-after-troopers-murder-b99544636z1-318544411.html", "image": {"width": 660, "identifier": "http://media.jrn.com/images/b99544636z.1_20150725220829_000_g7ubtua7.7-1.jpg", "height": 413}, "type": "article", "description": "Officials from local, state and federal law enforcement agencies will talk about improving communication after Trooper Trevor Casper\u2019s death, sheriff says.", "title": "Agencies seek to improve coordination after trooper's murder"}, "twitter": {"site": "@journalsentinel", "image": "http://media.jrn.com/images/b99544636z.1_20150725220829_000_g7ubtua7.7-1.jpg", "description": "Officials from local, state and federal law enforcement agencies will talk about improving communication after Trooper Trevor Casper\u2019s death, sheriff says.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Agencies seek to improve coordination after trooper's murder"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "fb": {"admins": "journal.sentinel.1", "app_id": 227386193957280}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://media.jrn.com/designimages/logo-mjs-144-icon.png", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb8df\"", "article_summary": "Credit: Wisconsin Troopers Association & Newaygo County Sheriff\u0092s OfficeBy of theOfficials from local, state and federal law enforcement agencies are meeting this week to talk about improving communication after a Wisconsin state trooper's murder this year, Marinette County Sheriff Jerry Sauve said.\nInvestigated in MichiganSnyder had been under investigation by the Newaygo County Sheriff's Department and the FBI in Michigan since about March 13.\nSnyder then drove to Fond du Lac and ambushed Wisconsin State Patrol Trooper Trevor Casper, who was following him while waiting for backup to arrive.\nThe sheriff said officials with the FBI and the state Department of Justice would attend.\nPeace also said that any delays were due to information being passed from the Michigan Sheriff's Department to the FBI and on to the Wisconsin State Patrol."}
