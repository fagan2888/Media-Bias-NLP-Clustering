JACKSONVILLE, Fla. - One of the few remaining anchor stores of the Regency Square Mall will be leaving the mall next year.

Our news partner, the Financial News and Daily Record, reports Belk is moving out.

Belk is one of three anchor stores at the mall right now.

They're building a new store several miles east on Atlantic Boulevard, at the northwest corner of the Kernan Boulevard intersection.

A going-out-of-business sale is scheduled to start in mid-December, and the mall location would close in mid-February. The new store would open in March.

It's not clear what would happen to Belk's space at the mall.

The mall's general manager tells the Daily Record that it could become part of a proposal to land the new Citizens Property Insurance operations center. The insurer is looking for about 226,000 square feet of office space.
