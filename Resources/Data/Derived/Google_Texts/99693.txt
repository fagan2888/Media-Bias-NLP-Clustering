Several citizens called in the fire after seeing smoke and flames.

The business is located at 6404 East 11th Street in Tulsa.

Several people called the Tulsa Fire Department Sunday morning after seeing smoke and flames at Escapades Gentlemen's Club at 6404 East 11th Street. Firefighters got to the structure fire just after 6 a.m., according to Captain Stan May, public information officer.

The back half of the building was fully involved with fire, May said.

"We made entry from the front, made sure we got all that secured," he said. "It took a little while for us to force entry into the back, get the fire knocked down."

May said the inside of the building was "choppy" and difficult to negotiate.

"It's looking like the back half of the structure is going to be a total loss," he said.

There were no reports of injuries. The cause of the fire is under investigation.
