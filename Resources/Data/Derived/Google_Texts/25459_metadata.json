I\u2019m watching with my 11-year-old triplet sons and there\u2019s some squirming in the room. Leo says, \u201cThis is Ace\u2019s favorite bit.\u201d\n\nAce snorts, \u201cNo, it\u2019s not. My favorite part is where everybody dies.\u201d Luke laughs.\n\nWe\u2019re watching a scene from \u201cCatching Fire\u201d on TV because they\u2019ve been bugging me to show them a piece of the \u201cHunger Games\u201d film franchise, even though their mom and I agree they\u2019re too young to go with me to the premiere of \u201cThe Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 2\u201d later that day.\n\nWe did let our kids read the books, which they devoured, sometimes getting into arguments about who had claimed the rights over who had dibs on \u201cCatching Fire\u201d or \u201cMockingjay.\u201d\n\nAfter that, the archery set that had been in the garage for months re-emerged and arrows started flying through our backyard.\n\nThere\u2019s been plenty of ink and pixels devoted to Katniss\u2019 influence on girls, book sales, the sport of archery and even Jennifer Lawrence herself. I think it\u2019s time to talk about her value to another demographic \u2013 boys.\n\nFirst, I claim no objectivity about \u201cThe Hunger Games\u201d saga. It had me at \u201cThis is the day of the reaping.\u201d Hell, these books reaped me. I\u2019m a 44-year-old man whose normal reading pace is a page or two per night before bed. (People worry that George R.R. Martin might not live long enough to finish \u201cA Song of Ice and Fire\u201d \u2013 I\u2019m not sure I will, either.)\n\nI read all 1,174 pages of Suzanne Collins\u2019 trilogy in about four days. I did no work. Minimal chores. When my wife wasn\u2019t home, the triplets lived their own version of the Hunger Games in our kitchen because I\u2019d stopped preparing food.\n\n\u201cThe Hunger Games\u201d books thrilled, fascinated, worried and wounded me; they left me exhausted, dazed and grateful.\n\nI wanted my sons to read them in part to share the experience, but also because I feel like maybe they needed it. Unlike too many boys, these guys read. Outside of Japanese manga and a book written by their own grandmother, they tend to read stories about other members of their own demographic. That\u2019s easy to do. According to one study of children\u2019s literature, male characters are featured \u201cnearly twice as often in titles and 1.6 times as often as central characters.\u201d (Among feature films popular with kids, the ratio is even worse.)\n\nIn addition, my sons (like me) have no sisters, and I\u2019m not aware of any female friends with whom they seem terribly close. I don\u2019t want the interior life of girls to be as entirely foreign to them as it once felt to me.\n\nAnnette Wannamaker teaches young adult literature at Eastern Michigan University and writes about boys and media. \u201c\u2018The Hunger Games\u2019 is a great text for boys and girls to read because Katniss is a non-stereotypical girl and because Peeta is a non-stereotypical boy,\u201d she told me. \u201cPeeta is heroic as well, but in a way that is not stereotypically masculine: He is brave and strong, but he is also nurturing.\u201d\n\nShe added that the idea that boys won\u2019t connect with a story about a girl is just wrong. \u201cThere\u2019s a myth that books need to have characters young readers can \u2018identify with,\u2019 but the exact opposite is true: literature gives us a chance to view the world through another person\u2019s eyes, to consider a perspective that is different from our own. This is vital because it teaches empathy.\u201d\n\nChildren\u2019s author Shannon Hale wrote in her blog, \u201c\u2026the idea that girls should read about and understand boys but that boys don\u2019t have to read about girls, that boys aren\u2019t expected to understand and empathize with the female population of the world\u2026.this belief directly leads to rape culture. To a culture that tells boys and men, it doesn\u2019t matter how the girl feels, what she wants.\u201d\n\nHale describes author visits in which the school only invited girl students to her assemblies. In one case, \u201cI did the presentation. But I felt sick to my stomach. Later I asked what other authors had visited. They\u2019d had a male writer. For his assembly, both boys and girls had been invited.\u201d\n\nI appear to be the only unaccompanied man who\u2019s come to this particular theater for the debut of \u201cMockingjay: Part 2\u201d here in Jennifer Lawrence\u2019s hometown of Louisville. The house is about three-quarters full (which I guess portends the supposedly disappointing opening weekend draw of \u201conly\u201d $247 million worldwide).\n\nI\u2019m here in part to complete my own \u201cHunger Games\u201d experience and also to find some male fans who don\u2019t live in my house.\n\nThe movie itself is satisfying, riveting and tense, though many scenes feel relentless, grim and gray. Still, it hits all the marks I need it to, particularly at the very end, when the girl from District 12 becomes her own woman, not exactly at peace, but no longer on fire.", "article_metadata": {"description": "After my triplets read the first \"Hunger Games\" book, their dormant archery set came out of the garage", "author": "Graham Shelby", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "After my triplets read the first \"Hunger Games\" book, their dormant archery set came out of the garage", "title": "Katniss is a hero for boys, too: My 11-year-old sons need more books and films like \u201cThe Hunger Games\u201d series", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/11/29/katniss_is_a_hero_for_boys_too_my_11_year_old_sons_need_more_books_and_films_like_the_hunger_games_series/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/11/hunger_games.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "After my triplets read the first \"Hunger Games\" book, their dormant archery set came out of the garage", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/11/hunger_games.jpg", "title": "Katniss is a hero for boys, too: My 11-year-old sons need more books and films like \u201cThe Hunger Games\u201d series", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Katniss is a hero for boys, too: My 11-year-old sons need more books and films like \u201cThe Hunger Games\u201d series", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Books, children's literature, Movies, Suzanne Collins, The Hunger Games, The Hunger Games: Mockingjay -- Part 2, young adult fiction", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "\u201cThe Hunger Games\u201d books thrilled, fascinated, worried and wounded me; they left me exhausted, dazed and grateful.\nTopics: Books, children's literature, Movies, Suzanne Collins, The Hunger Games, The Hunger Games: Mockingjay -- Part 2, young adult fiction, Entertainment NewsOn the screen, Katniss Everdeen and Peeta Mellark are kissing.\nWhen my wife wasn\u2019t home, the triplets lived their own version of the Hunger Games in our kitchen because I\u2019d stopped preparing food.\nFirst, I claim no objectivity about \u201cThe Hunger Games\u201d saga.\nI\u2019m here in part to complete my own \u201cHunger Games\u201d experience and also to find some male fans who don\u2019t live in my house."}
