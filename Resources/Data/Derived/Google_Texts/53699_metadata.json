Bill Flores, R-Texas, their next leader, sparking recriminations about inappropriate influence from \u201cestablishment\u201d leadership and open questions about whether the group had abandoned its conservative roots.\n\nFlores, 60, beat the supposed front-runner, South Carolinian Mick Mulvaney, 47, and fellow Texan Louie Gohmert, 61, for the chairmanship of the Republican Study Committee. He officially will take over the 170-member RSC in January.\n\n\u201cIt is my plan to lead the RSC as a member-driven organization which puts forth positions developed through member participation and dialogue consistent with the RSC\u2019s mission and the U.S. Constitution,\u201d Flores said in a statement. He continued:\n\nIt is important that we take full advantage of the RSC\u2019s size, character and the passion of its members to advance our conservative agenda in order to restore America to the \u2018shining city on a hill\u2019 that Ronald Reagan envisioned.\n\nMulvaney had been the favorite of many conservatives and Gohmert arguably is the most conservative of the three candidates.\n\n>>> Meet Bill Flores, the Texas Congressman Who Wants to Be \u2018Consensus Leader\u2019 for Conservatives\n\nFlores will succeed Rep. Rob Woodall of Georgia, who took over as interim chairman following the election of Louisiana\u2019s Steve Scalise to the post of House majority whip.\n\nThe Republican Study Committee began in 1973 as a caucus designed to promote and advance a conservative agenda. In recent years, however, many conservatives have become concerned that the committee has drifted from its roots and instead grown to become more aligned with House leadership.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s almost a wing of leadership,\u201d one conservative lawmaker told The Daily Signal today. \u201cWe pick up huge numbers and still have a RSC that continues to drift.\u201d\n\nThe lawmaker had hoped this year\u2019s RSC election would yield a leader who was willing to challenge the status quo.\n\nIn an interview with The Daily Signal today, however, Flores said he disagreed with that premise. Instead, he argued that RSC is \u201cjust as conservative as it ever was,\u201d and said the ideological makeup of the entire GOP conference has moved more to the right, narrowing the gap.\n\nFlores said:\n\nRSC still stands for all the great things that are in its mission statement. Those are the things we\u2019re going to aspire to fulfill when I become chairman in January. I try to disabuse folks of the notion that for some reason the RSC is viewed to be less conservative. It\u2019s pulled the House to the right.\n\nSources told The Daily Signal last week that leadership likely would throw their support behind Flores, which would help deliver him the votes needed to win the chairmanship.\n\nMembers gathered at 10:30 this morning to elect their new chairman. Gohmert received the lowest number of votes on the first ballot, and Mulvaney and Flores were forced into a runoff. Mulvaney then claimed 57 votes and Flores 84. That means 12 of the 153 members voting chose neither.\n\nAs he was leaving the meeting, Rep. Ra\u00fal Labrador of Idaho told waiting reporters that Flores likely won his 27-vote margin because of top Republicans\u2019 involvement.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s always leadership,\u201d Labrador, a Mulvaney supporter, said. \u201c[They] twisted arms.\u201d\n\nFlores, however, disputed Labrador\u2019s statement and said he had no knowledge of leadership playing a role. He told The Daily Signal:\n\nThere are four members of the GOP House leadership that are members of the RSC. That\u2019s only four of 153 people who voted. I think it\u2019s pretty hard to say that they had any outsized influence in this.\n\nFlores, who said Labrador\u2019s comment was \u201cunfortunate,\u201d cited the effort he and his 33-member whip team put in by personally calling all of the voting RSC members. They were the ones \u201ctwisting arms,\u201d he said. \u201cNobody else.\u201d\n\n>>> 3 Lawmakers Offer Their Political Smarts to Head This \u2018Study\u2019 Group\n\nOther lawmakers, though, expressed skepticism about Flores\u2019 role as RSC chairman.\n\nRep. Justin Amash of Michigan said he was not convinced the group will return to its conservative roots with Flores at the helm.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m disappointed,\u201d Amash said. \u201cOur membership has gone up because people have been dissatisfied with the RSC over the past few years, and I wish Bill Flores all the best, but I\u2019m not persuaded that the RSC is going to turn into the organization that conservatives expect it to be.\u201d\n\nThe conservative lawmaker who spoke to The Daily Signal said the Republican Study Committee has become an \u201cextension of leadership\u201d and that the group has come to serve as a stopping point for GOP members making their way up the \u201cestablishment ladder.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey will be a group that gets together, \u201d the lawmaker said, \u201cand when leadership says to jump, they will say \u2018How high?\u2019 \u201d\n\nIn an interview last week with The Daily Signal, Flores touted his ability to get along with anyone as an essential quality needed to lead the 170-member RSC:\n\nIf you look at my history in Congress in the last four years, you won\u2019t see that I\u2019ve done anything to embarrass the team or to burn bridges in the conference. You won\u2019t find any volatile quotes out in the press where I\u2019ve run the team down publicly.\n\nMulvaney and Gohmert, who has known his fellow Texan for more than 40 years, wished Flores well.\n\n\u201cMy warmest congratulations go to Rep. Bill Flores,\u201d Gohmert said. \u201cMay God bless the RSC and its new leader.\u201d\n\nFlores, a ninth-generation Texan, said he hopes to focus on job creation, economic growth, restoration of a strong national defense, promotion of traditional social values and balancing the budget as chairman of the RSC.\n\nHe touted his record of advocating a strong defense during his campaign for the chairmanship, saying he voted for all 38 defense bills deemed important to the conservative committee. Citing President Reagan, Flores told The Daily Signal that restoring national defense will be one of his foremost priorities:\n\nRonald Reagan believed in peace through strength, not through a piece of paper. The president is cutting deals but they don\u2019t mean anything for the safety and security of the American family sitting around the dinner table.\n\nKelsey Harkness contributed to this report, which has been updated.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Some conservatives aren't convinced Rep.
