After the elections, their 54 seats in the Senate and overwhelming majority in the House would be enough, the argument went, to bring productivity back to Washington. In a Wall Street Journal op-ed the morning after their election night victory, newly minted Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Speaker John Boehner vowed to \u201chonor the voters\u201d by \u201cfocusing, first, on jobs and the economy.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe first thing we need to do is demonstrate we heard what the voters were saying on Nov. 4. To me, they said we want you to function and we want you to solve problems,\u201d Texas GOP Sen. John Cornyn, the number two Republican leader in the Senate, told CNN in January. Days later, Boehner faced a revolt in his chamber, with 25 conservative Republicans voting against his re-election.\n\nRepublicans promised to get off to a fast start but after an ill-fated GOP strategy to fight President Obama\u2019s executive orders on immigration threatened to shut down the Department of Homeland Security in February just as the terror group ISIS made headlines for a gruesome mass beheading, any hopes for a functioning legislative body were quashed. Boehner had, after all, promised to fight \u201ctooth and nail\u201d the executive action allowing roughly 5 million undocumented workers to remain in the U.S.\n\nDHS was ultimately funded.\n\nIn March, Senate Republicans hijacked a bipartisan bill against human trafficking to impose new limits on abortion because \u2014 jobs?\n\n\u201cThe terrible, horrible, no good start for GOP,\u201d headlines read as Republicans reached their first 100 days in office, seeing only two bills become law \u2014 a terrorism insurance measure and a veterans suicide prevention bill, both of which were left over from the year before.\n\nNow as they head off to summer recess, Salon takes a look at just some of the broken promises Republicans will have to explain to their base supporters, supporters who have spent a summer being fed right-wing red meat by the likes of presidential candidates Donald Trump, Sen. Ted Cruz and the rest of the circus:\n\nKeystone XL pipeline\n\n\u201cIf we have a new majority next year, and a new majority leader, the Keystone pipeline will be voted on on the floor of the Senate, something the current majority has been avoiding for literally year.\u201d \u2013 Sen. Mitch McConnell\n\nThe Keystone pipeline, which would carry oil from the tar sands of Canada to the Gulf of Mexico, did win congressional approval. But President Obama eventually vetoed a bill that would have approved construction of the controversial oil pipeline, the first major veto of his administration. For their part, Republicans in the Senate, failed to encourage enough Democrats to go against the White House and override the veto in March.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Unified Republican control of Congress was supposed to break the chambers' gridlock.
