Sanders, characterizing his campaign as a revolution, didn\u2019t shy from his idealism and didn\u2019t divert from his focus on a \u201crigged\u201d economy and corrupt campaign finance system.\n\nThere is good reason for the candidates to try to put their differences in relief: This was the last debate before Iowa and New Hampshire, although it remains to be seen how much of an impact it will have given its scheduling on a Sunday night of a holiday weekend.\n\nAs for Martin O\u2019Malley, he struggled for airtime, even more so than in past debates. When moderator Lester Holt asked the candidates to answer in 30 second, he said, \u201cCan I get 30 seconds too?\u201d\n\nGuns blazing\n\nClinton blasted Sanders for reversing his position on giving gun manufacturers immunity from prosecution. \u201cThere is no other industry in America that has been given the total pass that gun makers and dealers were,\u201d she said, and noted that the debate in Charleston was taking place less than a block away from the church where nine African Americans were killed in a shooting rampage last June.\n\nSanders, who noted that he comes from a state heavy in gun ownership, tried to defend himself by citing his low score from the NRA. He called Clinton\u2019s attacks \u201cdisingenuous.\u201dO\u2019Malley pointed out that both candidates have been inconsistent. He got in his best line of the night, a dig at the Republicans for their lock-step opposition to gun control legislation. \u201cI have never met a self-respecting deer hunter who needs an AR-15 to hunt down a deer.\u201dI love ObamacareClinton gave a full embrace of Obamacare, while warning that Sanders\u2019 proposal for Medicare-for-all is too great of a risk after the divisive, decades-long debate to establish universal health care. She knows by experience.\u201dI do not want to see the Republicans repeal it and I don\u2019t want to start all over again with a contentious debate,\u201d she said, adding that he planned to build on the Affordable Care Act by reducing out-of-pocket costs and prescription drug prices.But Sanders is still stinging from Clinton attacks that his health care plan would jeopardize current entitlements. \u201cNo one is tearing this up,\u201d Sanders insisted, his voice sounding indignant as he called her attacks \u201cnonsense.\u201dThis is probably not the end of it, particularly as Sanders\u2019 plans for paying for a single-payer system get extra scrutiny.Speaking feesSanders campaign is built on anti-Wall Street populism, and he came to this debate with a line of attack on Clinton, for taking $600,000 in speaking fees from Goldman Sachs.\u201dI have doubts when people take huge amounts of money from Wall Street,\u201d he said.Clinton pointed to Sanders past criticism of President Obama, as \u201cweak\u201d and \u201cdisappointing.\u201d\u201dI am going to defend President Obama for taking on Wall Street, taking on the finance industry and getting results,\u201d she said.\n\nIf she becomes the nominee, Republicans will inevitably use such lines as fodder to make the case that Clinton would mean a third Obama term.\n\nIran deal\n\nWith the Iran nuclear agreement now in effect, Sanders spoke of a needing to move to \u201cnormalize\u201d relations with Tehran. As she has in past debates, Clinton tried to showcase more sophisticated instincts when it came to foreign policy.\n\n\u201cWe still have to carefully watch them,\u201d she said of the Iranian regime. \u201cWe have had one good day over the past 36 years.\u201d\n\nShe did the same when the topic turned to the situation in Syria. Sanders talked of enlisting more Arab countries to send military assistance to the war-torn region. Countries like Qatar, he said, have got to put \u201cskin in the game.\u201d Clinton, however, pointed out just how difficult it has been to build coalitions in the Middle East.\n\nWhat Will Bill Do?\n\nSanders defended an answer he gave at an Iowa town hall, in which he called former President Bill Clinton\u2019s infidelity \u201cdisgraceful and unacceptable.\u201d\n\nWhen asked about it at the debate, he said that he was responding to a question \u2014 not bringing up the issue himself.\n\n\u201cI was asked a question, and that question annoys me,\u201d Sanders said, adding that he has tried to avoid attacking Hillary Clinton even as the media has tried to goad him.\n\nModerator Andrea Mitchell noted that he didn\u2019t have to answer the question that way.\n\n\u201cThen if I don\u2019t, there\u2019s another front page. I mean this seriously. We\u2019ve been through this. His behavior was deplorable. Have I ever once said a word about that issue? No I have not.\u201d He said that he was going to debate on the issues, not Bill Clinton\u2019s \u201cpersonal behavior.\u201d\n\nAsked what her husband would do if she got elected, and whether he would have a \u201ckitchen table role,\u201d Clinton drew laughs when she said, \u201cIt\u2019s start at the kitchen table and we\u2019ll see where it goes.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "Variety", "twitter": {"description": "With two weeks until the Iowa caucuses, Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders sparred over issues like healthcare, gun control and Wall Street on Sunday at the NBC News/YouTube Democratic presidential\u2026", "title": "Democratic Debate: Five Most Memorable Moments", "image": "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/hillary-clinton-bernie-sanders.jpg", "creator": "@tedstew", "site": "@variety", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "HandheldFriendly": "True", "published_at": "2016-01-17 21:17:26", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://variety.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/8181b523e3c891bc770494a0bbbe8244?s=16", "news_keywords": "Bernie Sanders, Hillary Clinton, Martin O'Malley", "generator": "WordPress.com", "author": "Ted Johnson", "image": "http://i0.wp.com/pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/hillary-clinton-bernie-sanders.jpg?crop=110px%2C0px%2C806px%2C449px&resize=146%2C82&ssl=1", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ffffff", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "comment_count": 7, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "appeared_in_print": "No", "topics": "News", "body": "With two weeks until the Iowa caucuses, Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders sparred over issues like healthcare, gun control and Wall Street on Sunday at the NBC News/YouTube Democratic presidential debate in Charleston, S.C.\n\nThe attacks were more biting, more pointed, even louder than they were in past debates --- albeit still short of the raucous atmosphere of recent GOP encounters.\n\nClinton, facing the very real threat that Sanders could beat her in Iowa and New Hampshire, presented herself as a pragmatist who knows what's possible.
