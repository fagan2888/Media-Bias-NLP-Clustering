Stutzman refused the business in an emotional scene.\n\nAttorney General Bob Ferguson sent a letter to the owner of Arlene\u2019s Flowers, asking Stutzman to comply with state law, which forbids discrimination based on sexual preference. The AG said he would not have sued had she complied with the letter.\n\nThe 70-year-old florist refused. Ferguson filed a consumer protection lawsuit against both Arlene\u2019s Flowers and Stutzman as its owner.\n\nJudge Ekstrom granted summary judgment in the case late Wednesday. Earlier, the judge had ruled that damages could be sought against both Stutzman and her business.\n\n\u201cThe law is clear: If you choose to provide a service to couples of the opposite sex, you must provide the same service to same sex couples,\u201d AG Ferguson said in a statement.\n\n\u201cWashington has enacted laws recognizing equality for same sex couples, and I will continue to vigorously uphold those laws.\u201d\n\nKristen Waggoner, counsel for the Alliance Defending Freedom, represented Stutzman. She read far more into the case and its implications.\n\n\u201cLaws that are supposed to prohibit discrimination might sound good, but the government has begun to use these laws to hurt people \u2014 to force them to conform and to silence and punish them if they don\u2019t violate their religious beliefs on marriage.\u201d\n\nWaggoner, once a law clerk to state Supreme Court Justice Richard Sanders \u2014 renowned for his libertarian views \u2014 charged that \u201cthe government will bring about your ruin if you don\u2019t help celebrate same sex marriage.\u201d\n\nIn a statement, Stutzman said that government is \u201ccoming after me and everything I have just because I won\u2019t live my life the way the state says I should.\n\n\u201cI just want the freedom to live and work faithfully and according to what God says about marriage without fear of punishment.\u201d\n\nJudge Ekstrom, in a lengthy opinion, cited legal precedents ranging from a state consumer protection action brought against high-profile auto dealer Ralph Williams in the 1970s, to the historic U.S. Supreme Court discrimination case of Heart of Atlanta Motel vs. United States.\n\nHe discussed the Supreme Court\u2019s controversial Hobby Lobby decision, which allowed a private business to opt out of providing contraceptive services under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nHe rejected the argument that the state\u2019s anti-discrimination law violates the free exercise of religion guaranteed by the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. Ekstrom wrote:\n\n\u201cAgain, defendant mixes the distinction between belief and conduct, clergy and laity, and the distinction between accommodation and public accommodation, and as a result cites two cases that are distinguishable on their facts.\u201d\n\nUltimately, the decision rested on the distinction between religious belief and the exercise of trade and commerce under laws that forbid discrimination.\n\n\u201cReligious freedom is a fundamental part of America. But religious beliefs do not give any of us a right to ignore the law or harm others because of who they are,\u201d said Sarah Dunne, legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Washington, which backed Ingersoll.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Strange Bedfellows -- Politics News", "description": "A Benton County judge, in a case followed nationally, has ruled that a Richland florist violated Washington\u2019s Consumer Protection Act when she refused to sell flowers to a longtime customer p\u2026", "title": "Judge: Florist violated state law in refusing flowers for gay marriage", "url": "http://blog.seattlepi.com/seattlepolitics/2015/02/18/judge-florist-violated-state-law-in-refusing-flowers-for-gay-marriage/", "image": {"width": 320, "identifier": "http://blog.seattlepi.com/seattlepolitics/files/2011/02/Ferguson_Bob_2009.jpg", "height": 448}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "article": {"published_time": "2015-02-19T03:17:30+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-02-19T06:05:31+00:00"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://blog.seattlepi.com/seattlepolitics/files/2011/02/Ferguson_Bob_2009.jpg?w=640", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "NextGEN": "1.7.5", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Attorney General Bob Ferguson sent a letter to the owner of Arlene\u2019s Flowers, asking Stutzman to comply with state law, which forbids discrimination based on sexual preference.\n\u201cFor over 135 years,\u201d wrote Judge Ekstrom, \u201cthe Supreme Court has held that laws may prohibit religiously motivated action, as opposed to belief.\nJudge Ekstrom granted summary judgment in the case late Wednesday.\nIn February 2013, Ingersoll went to Arlene\u2019s Flowers in preparation for marriage to Curt Freed.\nA Benton County judge, in a case followed nationally, has ruled that a Richland florist violated Washington\u2019s Consumer Protection Act when she refused to sell flowers to a longtime customer preparing for his marriage to another man."}
