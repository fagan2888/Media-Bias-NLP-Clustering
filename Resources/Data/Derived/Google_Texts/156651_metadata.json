The president could win outright in a legacy-clinching decision by the Supreme Court or be dealt a stinging loss. But even if the court votes to remove a vital piece of the 2010 health care law, Obama still could have room to maneuver. Republicans are scrambling to come up with an alternative if millions of Americans suddenly lose their government-backed health insurance. The burden may fall on Republican governors to find a way out of the mess.\n\nIn coming months, additional areas may surface where Obama can wield influence by finding common ground with congressional Republicans.\n\n\"At this point, the president's greatest source of influence comes in those areas where Republicans, for reasons of their own, want to get something done,\" says the Brookings Institution's Bill Galston, mentioning corporate tax reform as one possibility. \"They can't do that without dealing with him to some extent.\"\n\nOn trade, a 218-208 House vote on Thursday breathed life into Obama's trade agenda after weeks of negotiation and uncertainty.\n\nMight that suggest some lessons learned that could foreshadow more deal-making between the president and the GOP-controlled Congress?\n\nHouse Speaker John Boehner isn't so sure.\n\n\"I'd describe most of what's gone on in the last three weeks as close to bizarre,\" the Ohio Republican said. \"I don't think I've learned anything from it.\"\n\nAsked about Obama's relationship with legislators in his own party after the trade defections, White House spokesman Eric Shultz was quick to point out that the president would spend a good part of his time over the next two days raising money on their behalf in California.\n\n\"You're going to see, over the next 48 hours, data that will answer that question,\" Schultz promised.\n\nObama, at an evening fundraiser in Santa Monica, acknowledged that there was still \"so much that's left undone\" on his wish-list and that some of his supporters had become disillusioned.\n\n\"Sometimes I feel like people forgot the essence of my pledge when I ran for president,\" he said, reminding the audience that he'd said all along that everyone has to work hard for change \u2014 not just the president.\n\n\"The good news is we can do it,\" Obama assured. But he also talked about handing off the baton to another generation, and of progress measured in decades, not months.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#185f7c", "application-name": "Business Insider", "twitter": {"description": "The president showed he still can command the national pulpit when he spoke compellingly about the shooting at a historic black church in South Carolina.", "title": "This week has shown the promise and peril of Obama's presidential end game", "url": "http://www.businessinsider.com/peril-and-promise-in-obamas-end-game-on-gun-control-and-healthcare-2015-6", "image": "http://static2.businessinsider.com/image/5583d3676da81170690d63f9-506-253/this-week-has-shown-the-promise-and-peril-of-obamas-presidential-end-game.jpg", "site": "bi_contributors", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.verticals": "politics-contributor,politics,main-contributor", "linkedin": {"owner": "mid:1d5f7b"}, "sailthru.tags": "2016 Elections, Obama, Associated Press, Gun Control, Nancy Benac", "description": "The president showed he still can command the national pulpit when he spoke compellingly about the shooting at a historic black church in South Carolina.", "author": "Nancy Benac, Associated Press", "sailthru.date": "2015-06-19", "sailthru.title": "This week has shown the promise and peril of Obama's presidential end game", "theme-color": "#185f7c", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://static4.businessinsider.com/image/5582f47e6da8114e7aa34ce1-50-50/this-week-has-shown-the-promise-and-peril-of-obamas-presidential-end-game.jpg", "news_keywords": "2016 Elections, Obama, Associated Press, Gun Control, Nancy Benac", "tbi-image": "http://static1.businessinsider.com/image/5582f47e6da8114e7aa34ce1/this-week-has-shown-the-promise-and-peril-of-obamas-presidential-end-game.jpg", "fb": {"app_id": 155043519637}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://static1.businessinsider.com/assets/images/us/favicons/mstile-144x144.png?v=BI-US-2016-03-31", "date": "2015-06-19", "article": {"publisher": "businessinsider"}, "sailthru.description": "The president showed he still can command the national pulpit when he spoke compellingly about the shooting at a historic black church in South Carolina.", "viewport": "width=1024", "og": {"site_name": "Business Insider", "description": "The president showed he still can command the national pulpit when he spoke compellingly about the shooting at a historic black church in South Carolina.", "title": "This week has shown the promise and peril of Obama's presidential end game", "url": "http://www.businessinsider.com/peril-and-promise-in-obamas-end-game-on-gun-control-and-healthcare-2015-6", "image": "http://static3.businessinsider.com/image/5583d3676da81170690d63f9-1190-625/this-week-has-shown-the-promise-and-peril-of-obamas-presidential-end-game.jpg", "type": "article"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Business Insider", "title": "This week has shown the promise and peril of Obama's presidential end game", "sailthru.image.full": "http://static1.businessinsider.com/image/5582f47e6da8114e7aa34ce1/this-week-has-shown-the-promise-and-peril-of-obamas-presidential-end-game.jpg", "tbi-vertical": "politics-contributor"}, "article_summary": "On trade, a 218-208 House vote on Thursday breathed life into Obama's trade agenda after weeks of negotiation and uncertainty.\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 For President Barack Obama, an encouraging vote on his trade agenda and a harrowing tragedy in South Carolina showcased the promise and peril of his presidential end game.\n\"The fortunes of the president can turn very quickly, and what appeared hopeless last week would appear a possibility now.\"\nBut on the big issues already in play \u2014 trade and an Iran nuclear deal, in particular \u2014 Obama still is very much in the game.\nBut he also talked about handing off the baton to another generation, and of progress measured in decades, not months."}
