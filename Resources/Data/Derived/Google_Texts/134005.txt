In Pete Heck’s column, “Carson strikes fear on the left,” it appears that Carson’s views are the opposite of the conservative views his party favors:

Carson stated in 2013 that semiautomatic firearms should be better regulated in large cities and high-crime areas.

In an October 2015 interview, Carson stated: “I actually have something I would use the Department of Education for, to monitor our institutions of higher education for extreme political bias and deny federal funding on that basis.”

During the 2015 presidential campaign, Carson has said that the current federal minimum wage of $7.25 should “possibly” or “probably” be higher. He supports a two-tiered minimum wage system, with a lower “starter” minimum wage for young workers. He also supports indexing the minimum wage to inflation, “so that we never have to have this conversation again in the history of America.”

As an alternative to the Affordable Care Act, Carson says: “Here’s my solution. When a person is born, give him a birth certificate, an electronic medical record and a health savings account.” In a December 2014 op-ed, Carson elaborated: “We need to remove health care from the political arena and recognize that any government proposals affecting the health of all citizens should be free market-based and should be so appealing that it would not be necessary to force citizens into the program.”

In October 2015, Carson said that if someone preferred the current Medicare or Medicaid programs to the health-savings-account approach, “I’m not going to deny you the privilege of doing that.”

So the Carson campaign’s demise will most likely come from within his own party.
