The third edition of this vital resource, compiled and distributed by the Christopher & Dana Reeve Foundation Paralysis Resource Center, is a free reference and lifestyle tool for people affected by paralysis.\n\n(Logo: http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20100511/REEVELOGO )\n\n\"The Paralysis Resource Guide is a one-stop handbook for the paralysis community,\" said Peter T. Wilderotter, Christopher & Dana Reeve Foundation President and CEO. \"As the only resource of its kind, it is an essential tool to help those new to paralysis as they learn to navigate and adjust their lives, as well as those living with paralysis who want information on how to live a full, active life.\"\n\nThe 442-page book contains information about seating and mobility, assistive technology, travel, disability rights, benefits, health maintenance and caregiving, as well as up-to-date content on the effects of the Affordable Care Act in both the private and public sectors. In addition, the guide contains a new chapter geared for the more than 67,000 military and veteran service members living with paralysis.\n\nVeteran Army Sergeant Matt Keil, who was injured when a bullet severed his spinal cord during his second tour in Iraq, utilizes the Guide to identify the resources, centers and programs available to the military community. Five years after his injury, Keil and his wife, Tracy, continually refer to the useful information in the guide and encourage others to also learn ways they can appreciate the new life they've been given.\n\nA Picture is Worth a Thousand Words\n\nNew to the Guide are fine-art portraits of people living with paralysis, photographed by Christopher Voelker, a Reeve Ambassador and professional photographer who has been living with paralysis since being injured in a high-speed motocross accident at age 16. Voelker's diverse portraits showcase the inner strength of a variety of paralyzed people, such as Sundance Channel's \"Push Girls\" stars Angela Rockwood and Chelsie Hill; comedienne Geri Jewell; Lourdes Mack, the 10-year-old named Little Miss Wheelchair California; and pro surfer Christiaan Bailey.\n\nThese revealing images will help readers see the strength and beauty that paralyzed individuals can maintain,\" said Sam Maddox, Knowledge Manager for the Paralysis Resource Center. \"We hope those who are newly injured see the spirit and individuality captured in these portraits, and realize that paralysis doesn't define who you are.\"\n\nThe Paralysis Resource Guide can be ordered or downloaded at no cost by visiting www.paralysis.org or calling 800-539-7309. E-reader versions, also free, are available on iTunes, from BarnesandNoble.com for Nooks and Amazon.com for Kindles. Android users can download copies using their Kindle app.\n\nLargest Paralysis Library Expands Offerings\n\nThe Paralysis Resource Guide is just one of more than 5,000 books and videos that are available to the public through the Paralysis Resource Center Library.\n\nThe Paralysis Resource Center Library was conceived by Dana Reeve, who had a vision of creating a one-stop destination where anyone living with paralysis could gather information and have their questions answered. Opened in May 2002, the lending library is housed at the Reeve Foundation's headquarters in Short Hills, N.J., and loans content to people all over the country.\n\nWith multi-media content continually added each year, people of all ages have access to a variety of information related to paralysis. Parents and children can access information in the expanded children's section, including videos and children's books, ranging from picture books of young children in wheelchairs to stories in which a family member is paralyzed. The books are designed to prompt discussion among children and help them see that they are not alone.\n\nIn addition to fiction and non-fiction books, the public has access to a wide variety of CD-ROMs, DVDs and videos, ranging from entertainment and award-winning productions, such as \"The Intouchables\" and \"Glee\" series, to educational and fitness films for people living with various causes of paralysis, such as Multiple Sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), stroke and spinal cord injuries. There is also content available on a variety of secondary conditions such as bowel and bladder management, pain and spasticity.\n\nIndividuals can borrow materials free of charge through interlibrary loans or directly from the Library, which also provides return postage for user convenience. New books and videos are constantly being added.
