Visits to hospitals have slowed following a busy period for doctors when the Affordable Care Act initially expanded insurance coverage to more Americans.\n\n\"The knock on Tenet is that they don't generate enough cash. They are forecasting a decent bit of cash flow growth in 2016, so I think that is a good sign,\" said Jefferies analyst Brian Tanquilut.\n\nTenet said it expects adjusted free cash flow of $400 million to $600 million in 2016, compared with $405 million last year.\n\nThe Dallas-based company expects full-year earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), excluding special items, in a range of $2.4 billion to $2.5 billion.\n\nAnalysts on average had forecast 2016 EBITDA, excluding items, of $2.48 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\n\nEBITDA in the fourth quarter, excluding special items, fell 5.1 percent to $613 million.\n\nThe fourth-quarter net loss was $97 million, or 98 cents per share, compared with a net profit of $61 million, or 61 cents per share, a year ago.\n\nTenet said weak in-patient admissions pressured results in the quarter. Adjusted admissions, including both outpatients and people who stay in the hospital overnight, rose 0.3 percent.\n\nLast month, Tenet's shares slumped to their lowest level in three years after the company said in-patient admissions fell 1.8 percent while outpatient visits rose.\n\nThe stock closed up 7.05 percent at $25.50 on Monday before the earnings report.
