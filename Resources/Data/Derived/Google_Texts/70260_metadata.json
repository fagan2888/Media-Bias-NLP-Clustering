(Jim Cole, AP)\n\nScott Brown is no longer exploring a U.S. Senate race in New Hampshire, now he's in it to win.\n\nThe Republican who formerly represented Massachusetts announced on a New Hampshire radio show Wednesday that he will, indeed, be running to defeat Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen and will make a more formal statement next week. Brown's move was reported by New Hampshire Today with Jack Heath on the show's Facebook page.\n\nBrown, who moved to the Granite State full-time in December, formed an exploratory committee last month that allowed him to raise campaign money. If he is successful in this campaign, Brown would become only the third U.S. senator to have represented more than one state.\n\nIn his Granite State appearances, Brown has taken aim at the Affordable Care Act and Shaheen's support for President Obama's health care law. Shaheen's campaign renewed its call on Brown to sign a \"people's pledge\" to reject outside spending in the Senate race -- which he did in 2012 in his unsuccessful re-election bid in Massachusetts.\n\n\"We hope, now that he is officially a candidate, Scott Brown will commit to the same standard he set in his last race on the other side of the border and the special interests to stay out,\" said Mike Vlacich, Shaheen's campaign manager.\n\nBrown still needs to win the GOP nomination in New Hampshire. Shaheen has been leading Brown by an average of 7.9 percentage points, according to surveys compiled by RealClearPolitics.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1paUfA6", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Scott Brown is shedding the \"exploratory\" label and will soon formally declare himself a Senate candidate aiming to defeat Democratic incumbent Jeanne Shaheen.", "og": {"site_name": "USA TODAY", "description": "Scott Brown is shedding the \"exploratory\" label and will soon formally declare himself a Senate candidate aiming to defeat Democratic incumbent Jeanne Shaheen.", "title": "Scott Brown takes 'exploratory' label off Senate campaign", "url": "http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/onpolitics/2014/04/02/scott-brown-senate-new-hampshire-shaheen/81588658/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/usatoday.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Scott Brown is shedding the \"exploratory\" label and will soon formally declare himself a Senate candidate aiming to defeat Democratic incumbent Jeanne Shaheen.", "creator": "@usatoday", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/1300ed2a01366c8f3a2319573a9d24773d09148d/c=522-0-3450-2928&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2016/03/10/USATODAY/usatsports/scottbrown-nh_001.jpg", "title": "Scott Brown takes 'exploratory' label off Senate campaign", "site": "@usatoday", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "fb": {"app_id": 215046668549694}, "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Organizations/U.S. Senate", "gci-asset-type": "story", "gci-categories": "Organizations/U.S. Senate", "title": "Scott Brown takes 'exploratory' label off Senate campaign", "author": "Catalina Camia", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "news/politics/onpolitics", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/aec5c76f0817996504f59c600ee98778fe82a807/c=888-0-3084-2928/local/-/media/2016/03/10/USATODAY/usatsports/scottbrown-nh_001.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/d28176d7e83472789abf4c2f3bd5ade6086399b1/c=522-0-3450-2928/local/-/media/2016/03/10/USATODAY/usatsports/scottbrown-nh_001.jpg", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/3e01f485ed240e7cbe3e32168c76429ba6ec9696/c=34-0-3938-2928/local/-/media/2016/03/10/USATODAY/usatsports/scottbrown-nh_001.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/bd6bd6dcafe012ca14a85e8ab9d72b9aaa41b0a3/c=0-347-3972-2581&r=x1683&c=3200x1680/local/-/media/2016/03/10/USATODAY/usatsports/scottbrown-nh_001.jpg", "publishtime": "2014-04-02T11:17:02-04:00", "shorthed": "Scott Brown is shedding the \"exploratory\" label and will soon formally declare himself a Senate candidate aiming to defeat Democratic incumbent Jeanne Shaheen.", "articleid": 81588658, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/328cd79d52c22561e66522c9c6e3afbeb99dd995/c=0-347-3972-2581/local/-/media/2016/03/10/USATODAY/usatsports/scottbrown-nh_001.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/eb8705880cf212a4c9f38eaca767d01439bacc34/c=1162-0-2809-2928/local/-/media/2016/03/10/USATODAY/usatsports/scottbrown-nh_001.jpg"}}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcefc9\"", "article_summary": "(Jim Cole, AP)Scott Brown is no longer exploring a U.S. Senate race in New Hampshire, now he's in it to win.\nScott Brown, center, talks to New Hampshire residents at a diner.\nIf he is successful in this campaign, Brown would become only the third U.S. senator to have represented more than one state.\nShaheen's campaign renewed its call on Brown to sign a \"people's pledge\" to reject outside spending in the Senate race -- which he did in 2012 in his unsuccessful re-election bid in Massachusetts.\nBrown, who moved to the Granite State full-time in December, formed an exploratory committee last month that allowed him to raise campaign money."}
