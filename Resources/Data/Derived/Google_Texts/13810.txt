One of the seemingly countless number of Grand Bargain advocacy groups funded in part by billionaire Pete Peterson is experiencing a problem the United States never will: running out of money.

According to the Huffington Post (via Politico), The Can Kicks Back, a millennial-focused organization whose goal is to rally America’s young in favor of raising taxes and cutting Medicare and Social Security, “is operating at a loss and may run out of cash as soon as April …”

This information comes from internal emails and documents that The Can Kicks Back accidentally left in a public Google group. One November email from Nick Troiano, co-founder of the group, says, “Without someone/something else covering staff costs and without fundraising miracles like Stan or near-Stan happening consistently, I don’t know how we both sustain [an] organization and do meaningful things.”

The “Stan” Troiano makes reference to is Stan Druckenmiller, a wealthy hedge funder who donated $250,000 to the group in June.
