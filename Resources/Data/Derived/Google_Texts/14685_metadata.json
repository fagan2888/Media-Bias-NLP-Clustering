The amount will decrease to 95 percent in 2017 and drop to 90 percent in 2020. The cost for states to cover that remaining 10 percent has been a primary argument from Republican governors and state lawmakers against expanding Medicaid coverage.\n\nOffering to completely cover three years of expansion even for latecomers is part of a concerted push by the administration to convince the remaining holdout states to expand Medicaid coverage in President Barack Obama's last year in office. Obama's budget proposal will be released Feb. 9.\n\nThe administration's proposal would provide any state that takes up the Medicaid expansion the same three years of full federal support and the gradual decrease that the 2014 expansion states received, \u201cno matter when the state takes up the option,\u201d the posting by Office of Management and Budget Director Shaun Donovan and Cecilia Munoz, director of president's Domestic Policy Council, said.\n\nCongressional Approval\n\nThe proposal would need to be approved by the Republican-controlled Congress, which is unlikely, especially since lawmakers just voted to completely repeal the expansion as part of the reconciliation bill (04 HCDR, 1/7/16).\n\n\u201cWe hope Congress will act to provide this extra incentive to states that haven't yet expanded, encouraging them not to miss out on the benefits other states are already enjoying,\u201d the White House said in the blog.\n\nThe announcement comes just days after Louisiana's newly elected governor John Bel Edwards (D) signed an executive order expanding Medicaid effective July 1 (08 HCDR, 1/13/16), and coincides with Obama's visit to the state. The ACA lets states make their own decision about expanding coverage to all non-elderly adults with income below 133 percent of the federal poverty level, and Edwards's order will make Louisiana the 31st state, plus the District of Columbia, to do so.\n\n\u201cThis common-sense proposal makes the expansion as good a deal for states that expand now as it is for the states that have already done so,\u201d the announcement said. \u201cIt is further evidence of the administration's willingness to work with states to build on recent progress in improving health coverage and making Medicaid affordable to states and taxpayers alike.\u201d\n\nStakeholder Praise\n\nAmerica's Essential Hospitals, which represents mostly community safety-net systems, praised the decision in a Jan. 14 statement.\n\n\u201cOur hospitals look to Medicaid expansion as a necessity. Unsustainable costs from uncompensated care\u2014especially where expansion has not occurred\u2014threaten their ability to deliver vital care to their communities,\u201d Bruce Siegel, the group's president and chief executive officer, said. \u201cStates that so far have refused to expand Medicaid undermine progress toward a country where no one goes without basic health care. We call on those states to reconsider their decisions and work with the president to bring a full, national expansion of Medicaid across the finish line.\u201d\n\nPatient advocacy group Families USA also praised the proposal and urged Congress to pass it.\n\n\u201cState legislatures are convening to draw up their budgets, and this could be crucial to their deliberations. Governors and legislatures can now be reassured that, as they extend coverage, their states\u2019 budgets and economies will also be strengthened,\u201d Ron Pollack, Families USA executive director, said in a statement. \u201cThe reluctant states have nothing to lose. History shows the federal government honored its commitments for full federal funding. Given this offer, it would be unconscionable for state legislatures not to accept the President's offer. In fact, they should lobby for it on behalf of their constituents.\u201d\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Nathaniel Weixel in Washington at nweixel@bna.com\n\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Janey Cohen at jcohen@bna.com", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.bna.com/white-house-proposes-n57982066301/", "image": "http://www.bna.com/uploadedImages/BNA_V2/Company/BnaSocialShare.jpg", "description": "States that have yet to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act would receive three years of federal matching funds under a plan that the White House will propose in its fiscal year 2017 budget, according to a Jan. 14 White House blog post.", "title": "White House Proposes New Medicaid Expansion Incentives"}, "csrf-token": "qO6bcH5bVtqiRl1HB2P6q-Vtt6u-jwMQZfpdy19QMXW3U8eGs2V-QuwKH-eV71Kv3tCINqwMfR64Tlt4_v9bAT0AS87tru6XcemG-6SM_ao1:qR-FhQyoahAElnzhEPIHsZdG-pH3WwdwBjrkb-7zLDJ1-hCb3ZPgNdK4jCJBgvBde7ENpfYBI2cUE5XzLfu-hg--LVwrR4HyCvWzFHfHwfc1", "description": "States that have yet to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act would receive three years of federal matching funds under a plan that the White House will propose in its fiscal year 2017 budget, according to a Jan", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "fragment": "!"}, "article_summary": "Under current law, the federal government pays 100 percent of the cost of Medicaid expansion until 2017.\n\u201cOur hospitals look to Medicaid expansion as a necessity.\n\u201cStates that so far have refused to expand Medicaid undermine progress toward a country where no one goes without basic health care.\nThe cost for states to cover that remaining 10 percent has been a primary argument from Republican governors and state lawmakers against expanding Medicaid coverage.\nJan. 14 \u2014 States that have yet to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act would receive three years of federal matching funds under a plan that the White House will propose in its fiscal year 2017 budget, according to a Jan. 14 White House blog post."}
