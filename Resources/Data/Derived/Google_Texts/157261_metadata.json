(Photo: Brian Wilson/DNJ)\n\nMURFREESBORO \u2014 Graduates of Middle Tennessee State University were encouraged to aim for future and remain willing to give back by U.S. Sen. Bob Corker and Juvenile Court Judge Donna Scott Davenport during the university commencement ceremonies Saturday.\n\n\u201cI dare you\u00ad \u2014 each one \u2014 I dare you to dream your greatest dreams and reach for your highest goals,\u201d Davenport told the graduates during the morning ceremony.\n\nUniversity officials said 1,841 students were set to cross the Murphy Center stage Saturday during the event marking the end of the fall semester at the Murfreesboro university.\n\n\u201cWith this ceremony, you now become part of the distinct history and tradition of this institution,\u201d said MTSU President Sidney A. McPhee.\n\nEven after the ceremony, tears were still likely to come for some graduates as they realized they had finished their degrees, said Savannah Green, who graduated from the College of Education on Saturday.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s just no way to explain this,\u201d Green said moments after receiving her diploma. \u201cIt means so much with all of the hard work going into it.\u201d\n\nCorker, who spoke at the afternoon ceremony, called on graduates to do three things as they moved on from the institution \u2014 master something, have a bold vision and give back.\n\n\u201cMake sure you are indispensable in whatever you pursue after today,\u201d the senator said.\n\nCorker also noted the strength of Rachel Ruppe, who graduated with a bachelor\u2019s degree in English after suffering from injuries sustained in a car wreck in 2011.\n\nAfter relearning how to walk and talk again at a rehabilitation center in Knoxville, Ruppe was able to complete her final semester of courses online, according a news release from the university.\n\nThe standing-room-only crowd roared as Ruppe used her walker to cross the stage and receive her degree.\n\n\u201cShe has probably had to persevere more than anybody here,\u201d Corker said during his remarks.\n\nThe day also capped years of work for state Rep. Mike Sparks, who graduated with a degree in university studies Saturday afternoon.\n\nThe Smyrna lawmaker took a mixture of online and on-campus courses for years to complete his bachelor\u2019s degree while serving in the state House and working nights at Nissan.\n\n\u201cI believe it\u2019ll help me be a little bit more well-rounded,\u201d Sparks said in the university release.\n\nDavenport, who has served as Rutherford County\u2019s Juvenile Court judge since 2000, told students during the morning graduation ceremony that showing honesty, integrity and a sense of justice are crucial traits to keep as they move on from MTSU.\n\nWhile financial gains could come to these graduates through their work and degrees, she said that material wealth is only part of their overall success.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to be so much wealthier as you go through these goals if you keep your character intact,\u201d Davenport said.\n\nBefore hundreds of students crossed the stage, she said their work and effort to earn their degrees would create the environment where future goals could be achieved.\n\n\u201cI know each one of you will be reaching for that success when you reach for that diploma today,\u201d Davenport said.\n\nReach Brian Wilson at 615-278-5165.
