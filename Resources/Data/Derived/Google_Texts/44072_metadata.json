However, we need to have a strategy. We need to be the leading producer of oil and natural gas, so that the world looks to us for energy instead of looking at the middle east,\" Daines said.\"America absolutely has a role to play in ending ISIS, but we cannot be the policeman of the world. We need to have a serious conversation about how much this is going to cost and where the money comes from,\" Curtis said.\"During the government shutdown, I refused to take my salary and donated it to the Big Sky Honor Flight,\" Daines said.\"No, I would not vote for a government shutdown because our state lost millions of dollars,\" Curtis said.\"I believe the answer to the healthcare problem is to have a Montana based solution. I didn't vote against Obamacare 40 times, I voted against it once, to repeal Obamacare and that's my voting record,\" Daines said.\n\n\"I would just ask anyone who's voted to repeal the Affordable Care Act, to try to explain that to my mom, who has not had health insurance for 31 years, but now has access to preventative care and helping for her prescriptions, Curtis said.\"\n\nAnother debate between the two is scheduled for Tuesday, October 21st, in Sidney.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-17", "Description": "U.S Senate Candidates Amanda Curtis and Steve Daines faced off in their first debate, on the campus of Montana State University Billings.", "og": {"url": "http://www.kulr8.com/story/26836540/curtis-daines-debate", "image": "http://KULR.images.worldnow.com/images/5287431_G.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "U.S Senate Candidates Amanda Curtis and Steve Daines faced off in their first debate, on the campus of Montana State University Billings.", "title": "Curtis, Daines Debate"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://KULR.images.worldnow.com/images/5287431_G.jpg", "description": "U.S Senate Candidates Amanda Curtis and Steve Daines faced off in their first debate, on the campus of Montana State University Billings.", "card": "summary", "title": "Curtis, Daines Debate"}, "wnreadableurl": "curtis-daines-debate", "ROBOTS": "index,follow,noarchive", "owner": "KULR", "fb": {"app_id": 1410618595898891}, "date": "2014/10/21", "google-site-verification": "Zs_dGuy_d3SpT0OL83IDxbp-AHqGTLJESFtmdWTmV8c", "KEYWORDS": "KULR, KULR8, Billings, montana, news, weather, sports, Yellowstone, county, Magic City, Rimrocks, television, Cowles, Media, Live,, u.s. senate debate, amanda curtis, steve daines", "wn-version": "ContainerE-Story", "wn-base": "IIS22", "news_keywords": "KULR, KULR8, Billings, montana, news, weather, sports, Yellowstone, county, Magic City, Rimrocks, television, Cowles, Media, Live,, u.s. senate debate, amanda curtis, steve daines"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb593\"", "article_summary": "\"No, I would not vote for a government shutdown because our state lost millions of dollars,\" Curtis said.\nI didn't vote against Obamacare 40 times, I voted against it once, to repeal Obamacare and that's my voting record,\" Daines said.\n\"During the government shutdown, I refused to take my salary and donated it to the Big Sky Honor Flight,\" Daines said.\nWe need to have a serious conversation about how much this is going to cost and where the money comes from,\" Curtis said.\nAnother debate between the two is scheduled for Tuesday, October 21st, in Sidney."}
