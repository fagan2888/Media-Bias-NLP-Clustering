He has great hands. He has really worked hard at his shooting and has improved in that area as well. His energy is a great talent. It\u2019s really off the charts. He\u2019s had some big games for them. You\u2019re talking 25-point, 25-rebound games. Those are pretty special performances. This summer, he was terrific. He was a big multiple-effort guy who can cover a lot of ground defensively. His intensity is special.\u201d\n\nFamiliar face. It was only a two-month stint, but point guard Aaron Brooks made a good impression with coach Brian Shaw after being dealt to the Nuggets last season at the NBA trade deadline.\n\nBrooks left Denver during the summer, signing a one-year contract to play for the Bulls. He entered Thursday\u2019s game averaging 10.8 points and 3.2 assists this season.\n\n\u201cHe came in at the end of the season for us last year and helped out a great deal being able to hit shots and being able to run the team,\u201d Shaw said. \u201cIt was a huge pickup for them, and I\u2019m happy that he\u2019s playing well.\u201d\n\nFootnotes. Darrell Arthur continues to occupy an \u201cemergency only\u201d space. His strained lower left leg hasn\u2019t allowed him to return to full-time duty in the rotation. \u2026 Wilson Chandler returned to action after missing the second half of the Nuggets\u2019 loss to the L.A. Lakers on Tuesday with a quad contusion.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Chicago coach Tom Thibodeau a member of Kenneth Faried fan club", "title": "Chicago coach Tom Thibodeau a member of Kenneth Faried fan club", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/01/01/chicago-coach-tom-thibodeau-a-member-of-kenneth-faried-fan-club/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141220_095810_kenneth-faried-1.jpg", "height": 488}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141220_095810_kenneth-faried-1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2015-01-01T22:26:15+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T08:19:46+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdef14\"", "article_summary": "One of the coaches who has become a big Faried fan is Chicago\u2019s Tom Thibodeau.\nThibodeau was asked about Faried before the Nuggets and Bulls met Thursday night at the United Center.\nCHICAGO \u2014 It\u2019s no secret that Nuggets forward Kenneth Faried opened the eyes of those who got to see him up-close playing for Team USA last summer.\n\u201cHe\u2019s very talented and a great worker,\u201d Thibodeau said.\n\u201cHe\u2019s as good as it gets in terms of rebounding and his quick reaction to the ball."}
