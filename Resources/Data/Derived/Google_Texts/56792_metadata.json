She fought to get her brother, Jose Maria Islas, out of ICE detention. The mother of three children, she will likely qualify to stay in the U.S., but not her brother. Mary O\u2019Leary \u2014 New Haven Register\n\nNEW HAVEN >> Almost eight years in the country, Jose Luis Piscil is in deportation proceedings, but hopes he can qualify to stay here and raise his two American children.\n\nJuana Islas, who also has American children, feels blessed that her life likely will get easier, but sad that her brother, who has helped her financially over the years, will not benefit from the major immigration reform that President Barack Obama is invoking through executive order,\n\nObama announced changes Thursday that are estimated to impact almost 5 million undocumented immigrants out of the 11 million in the United States.\n\nHis order eliminates fear of deportation for the parents of children born in the U.S. and expands the Deference Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) that Obama approved more than two years ago for young undocumented adults who had been brought here by their parents.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt also gives clear direction as to who Immigration and Custom Enforcement should target for deportation \u2014 namely violent offenders, gang members, threats to national security and any immigrants who recently crossed the border illegally.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll prioritize, just like law enforcement does every day,\u201d Obama said in his speech from the White House.\n\nImmigrants and their advocates gathered at the Latino Cultural Center at Yale University Thursday to watch the president explain his actions, which have drawn extensive praise from Hispanic leaders but criticism from Republicans who say he is exceeding his executive power.\n\nMillions will benefit, while others will have to wait for Congress to fix a system that most people admit is broken.\n\nA coalition of immigrant groups over the past year, when it was clear that Congress was not going to act, switched its pressure to Obama to invoke exective action. Chief among them were the Center for Community Change, the Center for American Progress, United We Dream, the Service Employees International Union and America\u2019s Voice.\n\n\u201cI was overwhelmed,\u201d said Kica Matos, an official with Center for Community Change and a New Haven resident. \u201cI never thought this would happen. The president did the right thing. It is a victory for millions of families who fought so hard. It is a victory for the immigrant rights movement. It is a victory for the civil rights movement.\u201d\n\nMatos and others, however, said they would continue to work for a permanent fix that helps all 11 million undocumented immigrants.\n\nEarlier, in a demonstration in front of the federal courthouse, Alok Bhatt of the Connecticut Immigrant Rights Alliance was proud of the accomplishments of he advocates. He said it goes beyond immigrant rights. \u201cIt\u2019s a human rights movement,\u201d he said.\n\nFatima Rojas and her husband, Luis A. Santiago, and their two daughters, Ambar Santiago Rojas, 7, and Jade Santiago Rojas, 4, likely will be among those who will not be faced with deportation for the next three years, unless the order is revoked by the next president.\n\n\u201cIt is a victory for the immigrant community, but it is a bitter one where only a certain portion of our community will be affected,\u201d said Fatima, who came here from Mexico a decade ago.\n\n\u201cI feel that the struggle now more than ever has to be bigger. We really have to send a strong message. It is not about what size of the cake we want. It is not even about the cake. It is about contributing to an economy\u201d that immigrants help run, and getting credit for that, she said.\n\nTopiltzin Gomez, 18, a freshman at Yale, sat on one of the sofas lining the cultural center as he listened to the president. Gomez said he crossed the border with his family when he was five years old; there are no U.S. citizens in his household.\n\n\u201cThere is still much work to be done and we have to keep on fighting,\u201d he said, although he praised Obama for this \u201cpowerful\u201d action.\n\nTo qualify for deferred deportation for the next three years, immigrants will have to pass a criminal background check and pay their fair share of taxes in order to get work authorization. They also must have been here for the past five years and be the parents of U.S. children or lawful permanent residents.\n\nThe undocumented parents of the young adults known as Dreamers are not included, but one estimate is that 60 percent of them do have children born in this country.\n\nFrom 1990 to 2007, the population of undocumented individuals grew from 3.5 million to 11 million, according to the White House, and since has slowed.\n\nThe action by Obama comes within days of Connecticut Gov. Dannel P. Malloy signing the TRUST Act that orders the Connecticut Department of Correction to only turn over to ICE immigrants convicted of a violent felony.\n\nObama was clear as to what the order does not do.\n\n\u201cThis deal does not apply to anyone who has come to this country recently. It does not apply to anyone who might come to America illegally in the future. It does not grant citizenship, or the right to stay here permanently, or offer the same benefits that citizens receive \u2014 only Congress can do that. All we are saying is, we\u2019re not going to deport you,\u201d the president said.\n\nBy letting people come out of the shadows, Obama said they will crack down on companies that hire undocumented workers.\n\nThe executive order for the Dreamers is now open to anyone born after 1981 and brought here as children before June 15, 2007, regardless of how old they are today.\n\nFor highly skilled immigrants working here, the order will allow immigrants to move or change employment more easily and it gives incentives to foreign entrepreneurs who meet certain rules to create jobs and generate revenue in the U.S.\n\nNone of the immigrants qualify for health care subsidies under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nAnother change however, will allow them to travel to other countries with advance permission.\n\nNick Torres of Junta for Progressive Action, which along with Unidad Latina en Accion are the two biggest advocacy groups in the New Haven area, said they always hold elected officials accountable for their actions, but also give thanks to those who help \u2014 and he singled out Malloy in the later category.\n\nMaria Praeli, of United We Dream, was one of the young adults who shouted out to Obama and the first lady when they made campaign appearances in Connecticut last month on behalf of Malloy. They were arguing for protection for their parents.\n\nMaria, contacted in Washington, D.C., Thursday, said her mother, Chela Praeli, will now qualify for protection because her sister is a permanent legal resident, having married a citizen.\n\nAs a Dreamer, Maria Praeli already has work papers and, under the new rules, she can go visit her grandparents in Peru. Still, she cannot qualify for grants to help with the cost of Quinnipiac University, or get health care subsidies.\n\n\u201cIt isn\u2019t the end, by any means, for any of us. But this does stop the bleeding until the problem is solved,\u201d Praeli said.\n\nObama, answering critics, said his actions are not amnesty. He said amnesty is leaving in place a system where millions live \u201cwithout paying their taxes or playing by the rules while politicians use the issue to scare people or whip up votes at election time.\u201d\n\nExecutive actions have been taken by presidents going back a half-century, he said.\n\n\u201cAnd to those members of Congress who question my authority to make our immigration system work better, or question the wisdom of me acting where Congress has failed, I have one answer: Pass a bill,\u201d Obama said.\n\nHe asked that disagreements over this issue be a \u201cdealbreaker\u201d for other problems that need to be solved.\n\nThe president said immigrants have always been a \u201cnet plus for our economy and our society.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre we a nation that tolerate the hypocrisy of a system where workers who pick our fruit and made our beds never have a change to get right with the law? Or are we a nation that gives them a chance to make amends, take responsibility, and give their kids a better future,\u201d he said.\n\nThe uncertainty of how these changes will play out for individuals was on Jose Luis Piscil\u2019s mind.\n\nHe has not been able to convince ICE to allow him to stay by using prosecutorial discretion. His attorney is now appealing on the grounds of proportionality.\n\nHe has no criminal record and deporting him for getting caught at the border several times when he was younger, Piscil argues is harsh.\n\n\u201cThere is a lot of speculation. We don\u2019t know the details,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "News, New Haven news, CT news, US news, world news.", "title": "Greater New Haven undocumented immigrants cheer Obama action", "og": {"url": "http://www.nhregister.com/article/NH/20141120/NEWS/141129939", "image": {"width": "1500px", "identifier": "http://www.nhregister.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/NH/20141120/NEWS/141129939/AR/0/AR-141129939.jpg?Maxh=1500&Maxw=1500", "height": "1001px"}, "type": "article", "title": "Greater New Haven undocumented immigrants cheer Obama action"}, "twitter": {"domain": "nhregister.com", "description": "NEW HAVEN >> Almost eight years in the country, Jose Luis Piscil is in deportation proceedings, but hopes he can qualify to stay here and raise his two American children.", "title": "Greater New Haven undocumented immigrants cheer Obama action", "url": "http://www.nhregister.com/article/NH/20141120/NEWS/141129939", "image": {"src": "http://www.nhregister.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/NH/20141120/NEWS/141129939/AR/0/AR-141129939.jpg?Maxh=900&Maxw=900"}, "site": "@nhregister", "app": {"id": {"ipad": "id568468308", "iphone": "id520203861", "googleplay": "com.spreedinc.providers.digitalfirstmedia.newhavenregister"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"admins": 18506000}, "keywords": "News, New Haven news, CT news, US news, world news.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "description": "NEW HAVEN >> Almost eight years in the country, Jose Luis Piscil is in deportation proceedings, but hopes he can qualify to stay here and raise his two American children."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcdf61\"", "article_summary": "It is a victory for the civil rights movement.\u201dMatos and others, however, said they would continue to work for a permanent fix that helps all 11 million undocumented immigrants.\nBy letting people come out of the shadows, Obama said they will crack down on companies that hire undocumented workers.\nObama was clear as to what the order does not do.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll prioritize, just like law enforcement does every day,\u201d Obama said in his speech from the White House.\n\u201cI was overwhelmed,\u201d said Kica Matos, an official with Center for Community Change and a New Haven resident."}
