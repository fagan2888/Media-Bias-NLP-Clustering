That eventually led me to seek out what had inspired the author, and so I attempted regular reading of Scripture, including the Gospels. Finally, there came a day in October 1999 when I opened the Bible and it was no longer just black-and-white words on a flat page. The words became alive -- God speaking to my heart. So I got baptized at a local Adventist fellowship whose pastor kindly agreed to my wish for a \"generic\" baptism, rather than one that would include the Adventist baptismal vows.\n\nAs I church-hopped in search of a faith community, I found professional community in New York City's conservative media underground of the early 2000s (and believe me, it was very underground at the time). My Virgil was Matt Berke, then managing editor of First Things, a great Jewish religion journalist I met in early 2001 on the NJ Transit Midtown Direct train. Matt told me about the Fabiani Society, a monthly social gathering of conservative journalists sponsored by the Manhattan Institute. (He had a gift for connecting people; he also introduced R.R. Reno to First Things. Reno is now the journal's editor in chief.)\n\nThe journalists and other creative folk I met at Fabiani, including James Taranto, introduced me to the blog world, which was still fairly new in 2001, and helped inspire me to start my own blog, The Dawn Patrol. But it was actually one of my old friends from the music biz, Irwin Chusid, who helped me get into mainstream journalism, by introducing me to masterful New York Post copy-desk pro Joshua Tanzer.\n\nThrough Joshua, who had authored such classic headlines as \"Martha Stewart stock falling like a bad souffl\u00e9,\" I obtained a tryout at the Post copy desk in early 2002, and the rest is headline history. (That last link will take you to the headline of mine that won first place in the 2004 New York State Associated Press Awards for \"Brightest Headline.\")\n\nI can't remember when GetReligion first entered my consciousness, but I do recall the day in February 2005 when I merited (some might say demerited) two posts in one day: Jeremy Lott's \"Darkness at Dawn\" and tmatt's \"Dawn of the Deed: Was the mistake fatal?\" The posts popped up after a profile of me by George Gurley in the New York Observer detailed how I was fired from the Post after altering a story -- adding additional information to offer some balance -- in a way that reflected my pro-life sympathies.\n\nThe issues surrounding my firing were complicated by the fact that the specific reason Post editor-in-chief Col Allan cited to me for the dismissal was not that I made the unauthorized changes, for which I apologized. Rather, he said to me, \"I'm very concerned about your blog.\"\n\nAt that time, I was using my blog, The Dawn Patrol, to launch trenchant (and, I now regret, often personal and un-Christian) attacks upon Planned Parenthood, feminists and others with whom I disagreed on culture-war topics.\n\nAt that time, tmatt observed,\n\nIn the newspapers where I have worked, the changes she made would have been considered on the pushy side, but not fatal. They are right at the point where you should clear them with an editor, or the reporter, if you can. No way you get fired for this stuff. The blogging on company time issue is something else -- a whole new source of tension between journalists and their bosses.\n\nJust for the record, even if tmatt is right that my offense was not fireable, it was wrong. I realized that at the time it came to light, and apologized; I realize it more clearly now. The right thing would have been to manifest my concerns to those in charge. Given the reigning environment at the Post (in tmatt's words, \"not a culturally conservative newspaper\"), I would still have lost my job, but my conscience would have been clear.\n\nI did enjoy a kind of parting shot -- but one that helped rather than hurt my employer. As I was heading out the door, behind the copy chief (who had tried to prevent my firing) as he chivalrously carried my proverbial box for me, I called out a headline to deputy chief Milt Goldstein, who was going to be in charge that coming Saturday, the day of a Donald Trump wedding.\n\nThey used it on the front page. You'll find it at No. 4 on this list from Advertising Age, as well as on the cover of this book, which is for sale in the gift shop at Washington's Newseum.\n\nA couple of days or so before my firing, while I was awaiting the axe to fall, I had an experience that led me to believe in the truth of the Catholic faith. Here is how I told the story to Marcus Grodi on EWTN's \"The Journey Home.\"", "article_metadata": {"description": "It is a joy and an honor to join GetReligion, as this site has done much to \r\nshape my understanding of the dynamics involved in news coverage of \r\nreligious issues.\r\n\r\nI am a very traditional religious believer with a decidedly unorthodox \r\nbackground.
