In his new book, The Real Watergate Scandal: Collusion, Conspiracy, and the Plot that Brought Nixon Down, Geoff Shepard, who worked on Nixon's defense team, offers never-before-seen evidence behind what he says was a detailed plot to evict him from office.\n\n\u201cTime and time again, document and document, it unwinds Watergate,\u201d Shepard told Townhall. \u201cI think of the book as Watergate\u2019s Watergate. That the real scandal was the trashing of our Constitution and our Bill of Rights in the successful effort to drag Nixon from office to realign political power.\u201d\n\nShepard dedicates several pages of his book talking about collusion. Collusion between the presiding judge in the Watergate trial, John Sirica, and the prosecution:\n\n\u201cJohn Sirica is a disgrace to the federal judiciary,\u201d Shepard said. \u201cWhat he did \u2013 and it\u2019s documented in the book \u2013 at least a dozen instances of secret meetings between that judge and Watergate prosecutors and other interesting people. You don\u2019t have to be a lawyer to understand the judge isn\u2019t supposed to get together with one side before the trial and work stuff out. And Sirica did it all the time.\u201d\n\nCollusion between the prosecution and congressional officials:\n\n\u201cThe special prosecutor was secretly assuring court and congressional officials that Nixon had personally approved to pay another blackmail,\u201d he said. \u201cThey were wrong. They couldn\u2019t prove that. Turns out to be the opposite. But we didn\u2019t know (those of us on President Nixon\u2019s defense team) they were making this secret accusation. If Nixon had known that\u2019s what they were saying about him he never would have resigned. Nixon wasn\u2019t a quitter and he knew he hadn\u2019t done that. But we didn\u2019t even know about the accusation.\u201d\n\nAnd the concealment of significant documents:\n\n\u201cWatergate prosecutors took the government files with them,\u201d Shepard explained. \u201cThis is not unlike having a private server and deciding later how many documents you\u2019re going to destroy. These are government documents and they should have stayed at National Archives and then subject to review with researchers like me. But three of the key prosecutors took their files.\u201d\n\nSo, why such a group effort to bring down the president?\n\nShepard said the left\u2019s disdain for Nixon began when he was a congressman in the 1940s and brought down Soviet spy Alger Hiss, who was regarded as a leftist hero. Since then, the author explained, the liberal elite has considered him a target.\n\n\u201cAnd what happened in Watergate if you look at it in retrospect, the eastern liberal elites got control of the special prosecutor\u2019s office, and they had a power to prosecute,\u201d Shepard said. \u201cThey criminalized prosecution. They staffed the place with all of their friends.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf what I disclosed in this book\u2026if this stuff would have been known at the time, Nixon would have never have resigned,\u201d Shepard said. \"He wouldn\u2019t have had to resign. And his senior aides couldn\u2019t have been convicted in the Watergate trial. What the book documents is that they cheated. The other side was so eager to run Nixon out of office that they cheated.\u201d\n\nThe author is hoping, however, that his book will work to reverse Nixon's tainted reputation.\n\nShepard pointed to similar battles being waged against conservative leaders today. Chris Christie\u2019s \u201cbridgegate\u201d scandal, the far-fetched indictment of Gov. Rick Perry, and the labor unions\u2019 forced recall election of Gov. Scott Walker (R-WI), just to name a few.\n\n\u201cMy conclusion at the end of the book is that we have to stop this,\u201d he said. \u201cThe GOP have got to learn what\u2019s happening to them and stand up and say this isn\u2019t going to happen again. We\u2019re going to go back-old topic, brand new disclosures, and study and learn what they did. And there has to be a court ordered investigation. There are people still around that participated in the secret meetings with the judge.\u201d\n\nYou can read more of Shepard\u2019s research on Watergate and the \u201creal\u201d scandal at www.geoffshepard.com and find out why he wholeheartedly believes the following:\n\n\u201cWe were robbed of a great president.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "\"We were robbed of a great president.\".05/26/2016 20:20:18PM EST.", "author": "Cortney O'Brien", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "\"We were robbed of a great president.\"", "title": "Cortney O'Brien - Author: The Real Watergate Scandal Was the \u2018Trashing of Our Constitution\u2019", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/cortneyobrien/2015/08/09/author-the-real-watergate-scandal-was-the-trashing-of-our-constitution-n2036123", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2014/177/d791069d-878a-40ad-b414-8e2aab5e7e71.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "\"We were robbed of a great president.\"", "title": "Cortney O'Brien - Author: The Real Watergate Scandal Was the \u2018Trashing of Our Constitution\u2019", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/cortneyobrien/2015/08/09/author-the-real-watergate-scandal-was-the-trashing-of-our-constitution-n2036123", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2014/177/d791069d-878a-40ad-b414-8e2aab5e7e71.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Author: The Real Watergate Scandal Was the \u2018Trashing of Our Constitution\u2019 , Cortney O'Brien, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "\u201cTime and time again, document and document, it unwinds Watergate,\u201d Shepard told Townhall.\nCollusion between the presiding judge in the Watergate trial, John Sirica, and the prosecution:\u201cJohn Sirica is a disgrace to the federal judiciary,\u201d Shepard said.\nAnd his senior aides couldn\u2019t have been convicted in the Watergate trial.\nThat the real scandal was the trashing of our Constitution and our Bill of Rights in the successful effort to drag Nixon from office to realign political power.\u201dShepard dedicates several pages of his book talking about collusion.\n\u201cWhat he did \u2013 and it\u2019s documented in the book \u2013 at least a dozen instances of secret meetings between that judge and Watergate prosecutors and other interesting people."}
