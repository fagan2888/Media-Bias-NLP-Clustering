A measure requiring some private employers to provide a minimum 30-hour workweek to their janitors, security guards, maids and other works is up for initial approval by the Jersey City City Council tonight, The Jersey Journal reported yesterday.

The proposal is being touted by labor union 32BJ as the first of its kind in the nation.

It would apply to employers in buildings larger than 100,000 square feet and residential buildings with more than 50 units.

The measure would also lead to more workers with health insurance since the Affordable Care Act requires large employers to provide insurance to employees working 30 hours or more a week.

"If you only work 20 hours per week at $15 per hour, that's only about $15,000 per year," said Desiree Taylor, spokeswoman for 32BJ. "You can't pay your bills on that salary in NJ, one of the most expensive states in the nation."

Council President Rolando Lavarro called the measure "progressive legislation."

Senior vice president at the New Jersey Chamber of Commerce, Michael Egenton, said he's concerned both about this proposal and about its effect on businesses when combined with other government mandates.

The council approved a paid sick leave law in 2013.

Should the Council OK a minimum 30-hour work week for some private employees?
