Scott Brown (R-Mass.), now running in New Hampshire, thought he\u2019d uncovered a potent new line of attack: he blasted Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.) for having raised the debt ceiling and preventing U.S. default.\n\nThere was, of course, a rather serious problem, aside from the Republican\u2019s confusion about finance policy: Scott Brown also voted for the exact same measures that raised the debt ceiling. The former senator had apparently forgotten his own record when he criticized Shaheen for casting the same votes he did.\n\nNew Hampshire GOP Senate candidate Scott Brown has been making immigration into a key campaign issue, attacking Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.) on border security in an ad and criticizing President Barack Obama for falling down on the job in an op-ed. But he has found himself in a bit of a bind, since one of the reforms he\u2019s campaigning against is something that he once voted for.\n\nIn an op-ed in his newly adopted home state, Brown condemned \u201cpro-amnesty policies that have encouraged people to come here illegally.\u201d What kind of policies? The Republican specifically blasted \u201cin-state tuition for illegals.\u201d\n\nPutting aside the fact that Brown still seems confused about the fact that \u201cillegal\u201d is not a noun, Amanda Terkel reports that the GOP candidate actually voted for state legislation that would make undocumented immigrants \u201celigible for in-state tuition rates and fees at the University of Massachusetts, or any commonwealth state or community college.\u201d\n\nIn other words, Scott Brown is once again disparaging Jeanne Shaheen for agreeing with Scott Brown.\n\nFor context, let\u2019s again note that Brown isn\u2019t some political novice. He\u2019s a former U.S. senator. Indeed, he\u2019s run for statewide office three times in four years in two states, giving him plenty of time to hone his skills as a candidate and answer glaringly obvious questions about the major issues of the day.\n\nWith this in mind, why is he so very bad at this?\n\nThis latest incident on immigration policy is a setback, but what matters is the fact that it\u2019s the latest in a series of missteps.\n\nAnd before that he made remarks about the Affordable Care Act that contradicted his own platform on health care policy.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "For his next trick, the former Massachusetts senator, running in a different state, will criticize his opponent for agreeing with him.", "original-source": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/scott-browns-latest-stumble-immigration", "og": {"site_name": "MSNBC", "description": "For his next trick, the former Massachusetts senator, running in a different state, will criticize his opponent for agreeing with him.", "title": "Scott Brown's latest stumble is on immigration", "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/scott-browns-latest-stumble-immigration", "image": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--1_91-1--1200x630/public/articles/h_14245000.jpg?itok=Nh6lREPi", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "msnbc.com", "account_id": 2836421, "creator": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/scott-browns-latest-stumble-immigration", "image": {"width": 830, "identifier": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--3-2--512x342/public/articles/h_14245000.jpg?itok=-1P5DJ2D", "height": 553}, "title": "Scott Brown's latest stumble is on immigration", "site": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "For his next trick, the former Massachusetts senator, running in a different state, will criticize his opponent for agreeing with him."}, "robots": "follow, index", "DC.date.issued": "2014-08-07T09:44:48-04:00", "jenga-session-config": "{\"when_to_init\":\"after_dom_ready\"}", "fb": {"app_id": 351594351545594}, "nv": {"author": "steve-benen", "tags": "election-2014,elections,equality,immigration,new-hampshire,scott-brown,rachel-maddow-show", "title": "Scott Brown's latest stumble is on immigration", "published": 1, "date": "08/07/2014 09:44:48 EDT", "address": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/scott-browns-latest-stumble-immigration"}, "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/steve.benen"}, "abstract": "For his next trick, the former Massachusetts senator, running in a different state, will criticize his opponent for agreeing with him.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Elections, Election 2014, Equality, Immigration, New Hampshire, Scott Brown"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fccdf9\"", "article_summary": "Back in May, former Sen.
