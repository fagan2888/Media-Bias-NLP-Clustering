But he ended up helping after some initial missteps!) but one that most people have given up on having, both because no one will ever change their minds on this and because so many new offenses have cropped up in the intervening nine years. \u201cThe View,\u201d a show about the way people with different perspectives metabolize the news, should have done a segment on Ferguson, but so far, a years-old remark provided the only heat the show\u2019s had in recent memory. Wallace told O\u2019Donnell, with genuine emotion, that Bush had been offended by West\u2019s remark \u2014 something he wrote in his memoir, which came out four years ago. As far as the contemporary Republican Party goes, the events depicted in \u201cDecision Points\u201d took place generations ago, but to Wallace, they\u2019re still fresh.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Rosie fights with Nicolle Wallace over, of all things, Kanye's 2005 remarks.
