Maybe someone should have checked with them first. A new poll finds the uninsured hate ObamaCare more than any other group.\n\nThe Economist/YouGov poll asked the public a series of questions about ObamaCare, and then broke down the findings based on their insurance status.\n\nAs with many other polls, this one finds widespread disapproval of the law. Fully 43% say it\u2019s a failure, compared with just 25% who think it has been a success. Nearly one in five say it\u2019s been \u201ca complete failure.\u201d\n\nAlmost half (48%) think the law has pushed insurance prices up, compared with 16% who say ObamaCare has reduced the rate of premium growth. (So much for \u201cbending the cost curve down.\u201d)\n\nThe findings get really interesting, though, when they\u2019re broken down by whether the respondents have always had insurance, gained coverage after 2013, lost coverage after 2013, or never had coverage.\n\nIt\u2019s not surprising that those who had continuous coverage over these years aren\u2019t terribly enthusiastic about the law. More than half of them say it\u2019s pushed insurance costs up, for example.\n\nBut ObamaCare isn\u2019t even terribly popular among those who gained coverage after 2013 \u2014 those who should be singing its praises.\n\nThe poll found that an almost equal share say it\u2019s been a failure as rate it a success (29% vs. 30%). A quarter actually want it repealed, while just over half want it kept the same or expanded.\n\nMore remarkable still is the fact that the uninsured are the most hostile to ObamaCare. The poll found that 50% of this group wants ObamaCare repealed (compared with 42% overall).\n\nA mere 14% of the uninsured rate the law as a success, while 49% say it\u2019s been a failure. And 60% say it\u2019s either raised premiums or hasn\u2019t made a difference.\n\nThese findings call into question a central premise of ObamaCare \u2014 namely that there were tens of millions of Americans who desperately wanted health insurance but were either denied coverage or couldn\u2019t afford it, and so needed this law. Clearly that\u2019s not the case for many uninsured.\n\nThe survey also points to a looming problem for ObamaCare. If the uninsured despise the law, they will be less likely to sign up.\n\nSince the uninsured skew younger, those enrolling will be sicker and more expensive, setting ObamaCare premiums on an ever-upward trajectory.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Health Care: ObamaCare was supposed to be a gift to the uninsured.
