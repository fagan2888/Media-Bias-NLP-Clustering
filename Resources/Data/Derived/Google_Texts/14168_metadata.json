We are naked, but he is unaroused. My push-up bra with extra padding lies on the floor. Was it a form of womanly deceit to hoist my small breasts up in cushioned cups, a bit of self-promotion to the coveted size C I\u2019ve always longed for? Earlier in the evening when I tipped back a martini with extra olives, his eyes locked on my falsified feminine pillows. Now in bed together, I think of signposts, yellow and black, which warn of wet, winding roads ahead. But mine bears a straight line.\n\nI turn to the window. The moon, like my heart, is almost full, but never quite. I\u2019ve been single for three years now. When I first moved to Hollywood, I dated a TV showrunner. Accustomed to giving feedback against an audition line of beautiful actresses, he immediately saw my issue. \u201cYou\u2019re not a girly girl,\u201d he pointed out. \u201cYou know what you should do? Go buy some sexy nighties. Get in touch with your femininity.\u201d\n\nMy heart wanes a little just remembering. I had taken his advice and gone to Victoria\u2019s Secret to face down my insecurity over lingerie. Teenage girls ran through the store, giggling and laughing. They hurried back to try on bright pink bras and lacy hip huggers.\n\nIn the fitting room, it wasn\u2019t long before the attendant knocked. \u201cNeed anything?\u201d\n\n\u201cI have the smallest sizes. They just don\u2019t fit.\u201d I cracked the door to pass her items.\n\n\u201cDid you try on any push-up bras?\u201d Before I could reply, she\u2019d gone and come back with one in leopard print, the other a sultry shade of lavender. The Miracle Bra \u2014 the name held promise: make me more, maybe enough. But the showrunner didn\u2019t notice. As he wolfed down yellowtail from a sushi platter, he simply said, \u201cYou\u2019re more a guy\u2019s girl. We should just be friends.\u201d\n\nHis guy\u2019s girl comment might not have bothered me so much, except it was true. I was raised by my father. He taught me to shoot a rifle and hunt wild boar. I can bait a hook and gut a fish with two precisely placed slices at the gills. He often took me to the driving range and snuck me into the clubhouse for a Shirley Temple. I loved this time with my father, but he certainly didn\u2019t give me any helpful hints on how to be a woman.\n\nMy strategy of supplementation began in preparation for the eighth grade spring dance. My stepmother, who had large D-size peaches and an apple behind, took me shopping. I hoped that by some miracle of lighting or by finding the right dress my body would become more like hers, but the dressing room mirrors magnified my bony, flat body from all angles.\n\nThe first dress fit like a burlap sack. Where the cleavage should be framed, my ta-tas like tadpoles swam laps and poked their heads out for air. The dress I loved most was a blue-and-white strapless. It had a white slip beneath and an underwire that ran against the ribs and extruded out to make room for the womanly wonders I did not possess. Looking in the mirror, I was curvaceous; peeking beneath, two dirty pennies lay atop my flesh.\n\nAt the dance, the tissue I had used to stuff my strapless bra became loose and smashed, so I was forced to take breaks and repackage. The dress wasn\u2019t my fault; the stuffing wasn\u2019t my fault. I didn\u2019t have a mother.\n\nWhen a slow song came on, a cute boy named Marlon asked me to dance. We swayed as one that night, but when Marlon made eyes at me the next day, without my toilet tissue titties, I didn\u2019t think he\u2019d really be interested.", "article_metadata": {"description": "I finally found the solution to a lifetime of shame about my small breasts.
