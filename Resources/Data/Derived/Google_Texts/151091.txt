PORTLAND — The primary tech contractor on the failed Cover Oregon health insurance exchange portal has filed suit against the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, saying the agency has neglected to investigate misconduct allegations involving the exchange.

Oracle filed the lawsuit Tuesday in Washington D.C. Though Oregon is not named as the defendant, it’s the latest move in a lengthy battle between the software company and the state over who is responsible for the $300 million failure.

An attorney for Oracle, John Cooney, says the Affordable Care Act requires Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell to investigate allegations of misconduct involving exchanges, and has failed to so in Oregon or elsewhere.

Cooney says Burwell has a duty to look into claims made against Oregon as well as those levied against Oracle.
