Right now, the township consists of only 7 percent of commercially zoned land.\n\nGalloway also said the nature of the facility will add greater strain to emergency resources.\n\n\u0093Normally, I would be disinclined on a project like this in that location, but being that the applicant and the current property owner have both expressed a written desire to bring the property and business into the Joint Economic Development District we\u0092ve established with Painesville, I am going to say it\u0092s a benefit to the community as it relates to the development portion of this,\u0094 said Galloway, who is a JEDD board member. \u0093It is for that reason, I will vote in favor of this.\u0094\n\nConcord Acting Administrator Kathy Mitchell said the project is awaiting a site plan review from the Board of Zoning Appeals, which could be scheduled as early as its May 14 meeting.\n\nAdvertisement", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "News, Willoughby news, OH news, US news, world news.", "title": "Concord Township may get skilled nursing care facility in development district", "og": {"url": "http://www.news-herald.com/article/HR/20140222/NEWS/140229803", "image": {"width": "600px", "identifier": "http://local.news-herald.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/small/news-herald.png?052016", "height": "600px"}, "type": "article", "title": "Concord Township may get skilled nursing care facility in development district"}, "twitter": {"domain": "news-herald.com", "description": "A project to build a skilled nursing care facility in Concord Township moved one major step closer to reality this week when township trustees approved rezoning the parcel along Capital Parkway.The operator of the facility, VRC Management, has pled", "title": "Concord Township may get skilled nursing care facility in development district", "url": "http://www.news-herald.com/article/HR/20140222/NEWS/140229803", "image": {"src": "http://local.news-herald.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/small/news-herald.png?052016"}, "site": "@newsheraldinoh", "app": {"id": {"ipad": "id563963169", "iphone": "id520206415", "googleplay": "com.spreedinc.providers.digitalfirstmedia.newsherald"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "keywords": "News, Willoughby news, OH news, US news, world news.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "description": "A project to build a skilled nursing care facility in Concord Township moved one major step closer to reality this week when township trustees approved rezoning the parcel along Capital Parkway.The operator of the facility, VRC Management, has pled"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3b4d\"", "article_summary": "A project to build a skilled nursing care facility in Concord Township moved one major step closer to reality this week when township trustees approved rezoning the parcel along Capital Parkway.\nThe operator of the facility, VRC Management, has pledged to become the fourth regular employer to join the Concord-Painesville Joint Economic Development District and first since 2008 when the JEDD was established.\nFrancus said this facility will help Lake Health\u0092s goal in reducing readmissions and health care costs, all of which are tied to the Affordable Care Act.\nConcord Township trustees held a public forum and vote Feb. 19 to reclassify the 9-acre parcel into the township\u0092s first Gateway Health District lot.\nVRC Management President Michael Francus said the facility will employ as many as 120 people, all of whom will pay the district\u0092s 1.75 percent income tax rate."}
