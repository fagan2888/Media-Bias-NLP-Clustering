Shares of Intuitive Surgical settled somewhat after reaching lofty highs early in Tuesday trading as the company announced regulatory approval for its latest version of the da Vinci robotic surgery system.

Still, Intuitive /quotes/zigman/90651/delayed /quotes/nls/isrg ISRG shares posted a healthy gain of more than 8% to $474.03 in recent action. Shares had topped the $500 mark several times throughout the morning, jumping nearly 15% at their peak.

Intuitive’s da Vinci Xi won the approval of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, paving the way for the company to start selling it. Representatives for the company say the Xi’s single-console version will be the same price of the da Vinci Si, the most recent version, at $1.85 million apiece. For a dual-console version that can accommodate two surgeons operating the device, the price will be $2.3 million.

The da Vinci Xi is expected to be used in abdominal surgeries and is designed to be minimally invasive.

Intuitive’s share surge comes after a long slump that began about a year ago when the FDA said it was scrutinizing the company’s devices after a series of complaints. Shares dropped considerably, having neared the $600 level before the news came out. They fell again in July after the company announced an earnings warning and several downgrades ensued.

Coming out with a successor in the da Vinci line boosts its fortunes at a time when analysts are becoming concerned Intuitive’s technology will get left behind.
