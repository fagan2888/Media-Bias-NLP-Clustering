His stance created widespread confusion, prompting some judges to refuse to issue the licenses and others to shut down their operations for all couples, gay and straight, until they could get a clear answer. Still others decided to issue the licenses.\n\nOf the other justices on Alabama\u2019s high court, one agreed with the ruling while citing some reservations, and one, Justice Greg Shaw, dissented.\n\nIn his dissent, Shaw said it was \u201cunfortunate\u201d that federal courts refused to delay gay marriage in the state until the U.S. Supreme Court could settle the issue nationally. But, Shaw said, the state Supreme Court doesn\u2019t have the power to consider the issue and is creating more confusion by \u201cventuring into unchartered waters (sic)\u201d outside its jurisdiction.\n\nThe court released the decision while Gov. Robert Bentley and most state leaders were assembled in Montgomery for the state of the state address. A spokeswoman for Bentley said the administration was reviewing the decision and had no immediate comment.\n\nThe court\u2019s ruling came in response to a request from the Southern Baptist-affiliated Alabama Citizens Action Program and the Alabama Policy Institute, a conservative think tank, which asked the justices to halt same-sex unions.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The ruling contradicts a recent federal court decision that briefly brought marriage equality to the state", "title": "Alabama Supreme Court blocks same-sex marriage", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The ruling contradicts a recent federal court decision that briefly brought marriage equality to the state", "title": "Alabama Supreme Court blocks same-sex marriage", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/03/04/alabama_supreme_court_blocks_same_sex_marriage/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/02/gay-marraige-alabama.jpeg1-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The ruling contradicts a recent federal court decision that briefly brought marriage equality to the state", "title": "Alabama Supreme Court blocks same-sex marriage", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/02/gay-marraige-alabama.jpeg1-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Jay Reeves", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Alabama, Associated Press, lgbt equality, LGBT Rights, Marriage, Marriage equality, Same-sex marriage, SCOTUS, Supreme Court", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc145\"", "article_summary": "Topics: Alabama, Associated Press, lgbt equality, LGBT Rights, Marriage, Marriage equality, Same-sex marriage, SCOTUS, Supreme Court, News, Politics NewsProbate judges must again decide whether to issue wedding licenses to gay couples after the Alabama Supreme Court ruled the state\u2019s ban on same-sex marriage is legal, despite a federal court\u2019s decision to the contrary.\nThe U.S. Supreme Court, which already has agreed to decide the legality of same-sex marriage nationwide, also could be asked to review the ruling.\nAfter Granade\u2019s ruling, Moore told probate judges across the state not to issue same-sex marriage licenses.\nIn his dissent, Shaw said it was \u201cunfortunate\u201d that federal courts refused to delay gay marriage in the state until the U.S. Supreme Court could settle the issue nationally.\nThe all-Republican court sided with a pair of conservative groups Tuesday night and ordered Alabama\u2019s 68 probate judges to stop issuing marriage licenses to gay couples."}
