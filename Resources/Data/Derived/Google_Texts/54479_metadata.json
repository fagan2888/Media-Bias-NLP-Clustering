He wrote:\n\nJefferson\u2019s immortal words, \u201cWe hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights.\u201d Those words embody the American Dream: that our individual rights emanate from God, our Creator, not from man or government. It is that deep Judeo-Christian faith that enabled 56 men to embark upon the quest of creating a nation where the individual reigned preeminent.\n\nBut, West warned, other forces are working to destroy both the American dream and American exceptionalism \u2014 the thing that makes us unique in the world.\n\n\u201cSo how was it that I gazed upon two electronic billboards promoting an ideology that translates into the word, \u2018surrender?\u2019\u201d he asked. \u201cAmerica is facing its most threatening challenge, a dangerous triumvirate of progressive socialism, secular humanism, and Islamic totalitarianism.\u201d\n\nMuch of the mainstream news for the past three weeks has focused on progressive socialism \u2014 the Affordable Care Act\u2019s failed takeover of one-sixth of the national economy.\n\nWe saw the threat early in President Obama\u2019s first term, when he bailed out two of America\u2019s big three automakers, saying he didn\u2019t intend to run their businesses \u2014 then proceeded to run their businesses.\n\nBut Obama isn\u2019t the only one to blame for progressive socialism. He\u2019s merely accelerating a century-old process, while destroying our greatness in the process.\n\nEqually disturbing is that progressive socialism \u201cseeks to erode any faith or belief system in God and religion,\u201d West wrote, offering an example from last year. \u201cYou might recall, it was at last years\u2019 Democrat National convention where they had to conduct a vote to reinsert God into their platform. We all remember the disturbing boos and resounding NAY votes rising from the convention floor.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe will become a nation of secular humanists, set adrift with no foundation, no faith, clinging to a belief that government can provide our needs,\u201d West wrote. \u201cWe will no longer be \u2018one Nation under God\u2019 but rather one nation gone under, as Ronald Reagan so aptly stated.\u201d\n\nThe people of \u201ca nation gone under\u201d with no moral compass or belief system \u201care primed for the infiltration, the stealth jihad that undermines any remaining concept of faith, in other words, Islamic totalitarianism,\u201d he wrote.\n\nBut there is a ray of hope in the form of a classic Westernization, he said:\n\n\u201cIn the end, progressive socialism, secular humanism, and Islamic totalitarianism will be tossed upon the ash heap with fascism, imperialism, and communism because in America, those dawgs don\u2019t hunt.\u201d\n\n[poll id=\u201d128\u2033]", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.4.3", "og": {"site_name": "BizPac Review", "description": "Former Congressman Allen West said the road to \u201cIslamic totalitarianism\u201d is being paved by progressive socialism and secular humanism, according to a column he wrote Saturday.
