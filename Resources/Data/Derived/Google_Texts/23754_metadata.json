Pitman\n\nStaff Writer\n\nA government shutdown Oct. 1 could immediately suspend or delay food stamp payments to some of the more than 44,000 Butler County residents who receive the food aid.\n\nThe Agriculture Department said Tuesday that it will stop providing benefits at the beginning of October if Congress does not pass legislation to keep government agencies open.\n\nRepublican leaders in Congress are racing to avert a government shutdown next week when the budget year ends and a temporary funding bill is required to keep agencies operating. The process has been complicated because of a battle over federal funding for Planned Parenthood and the group\u2019s involvement in the practice of procuring tissue from aborted fetuses for research purposes.\n\n\u201cSNAP is the first line of defense against hunger in our country. It is a lifeline for the poorest among us,\u201d said Lisa Hamler-Fugitt, executive director of Ohio Association of Foodbanks, which consists of 12 foodbanks including Shared Harvest in Fairfield.\n\nSNAP \u2014 or the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program \u2014 is used by more than 1 million Ohioans, according to June totals, the latest available data\n\n\u201cThe direct beneficiaries of the SNAP program are poor children, seniors, the disabled, veterans and those who work serving us in low-wage, often part-time, temporary and contingent jobs,\u201d Hamler-Fugitt said.\n\nHamler-Fugitt said Ohio ranks sixth-highest for food insecurity with around 1.8 million Ohioans living in poverty. Food assistance requests have increased by 40 percent since 2010 for the emergency food network\u2019s 12 foodbanks and 3,300 member charities, she said. Foodbanks and member charities, which the lion\u2019s share are faith-based groups, \u201ccannot hold the floodgates\u201d as the demand for food requests increase who may not be eligible for SNAP, she said.\n\nIn 2013, the government shut down for 16 days over the political battle on the funding of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, commonly referenced as ObamaCare.\n\nThe impact of that 2013 shutdown was felt by millions of Americans who weren\u2019t able to receive their monthly food assistance benefits. Butler County Job and Family Services Director Jerome Kearns said the department in 2013 did what it could to help short of providing funds.\n\n\u201cWe continued to process applications, we continued to do the things we needed to do to determine eligibility,\u201d said Kearns.\n\nAnd when people ran out of government-assistance funds, Kearns said they directed folks to local food pantries and information referral resources, such as 211 in Butler County.\n\nOhio Department of Job and Family Services spokesman Ben Johnson said the impact on Ohio is right now unknown.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re monitoring very closely but it\u2019s too early to say what, if any, impact would be,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t know enough now about what will or will not happen.\u201d\n\nSen. Pat Roberts, a Kansas Republican who is chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee, said Democrats concerned about SNAP dollars should vote for the Republican Senate bill that would keep the government operating through Dec. 11 and block Planned Parenthood\u2019s federal funds for a year.\n\nDemocrats are expected to block that measure later this week.\n\nSen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, said money that has already been allocated but not used will still be available if the government shuts down, but new allowances won\u2019t be issued during a shut down.\n\n\u201c We\u2019re on the brink of another manufactured crisis and a number of my colleagues in both houses of Congress seem to be threatening another government shutdown,\u201d Brown said. \u201cWe know that when you shut the government down in the name of saving money, you end up costing tax payers a lot more money to shut down and scale back up.\u201d\n\nSen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, is for defunding Planned Parenthood, and in August the Capitol Hill newspaper \u201cThe Hill\u201d reported the first-term senator saying, \u201cI don\u2019t think anybody is talking about shutting down the government, but we want to defund Planned Parenthood, so we\u2019ll see.\u201d\n\nIn February, Portman introduced the End Government Shutdowns Act in February to stop \u201clast-minute deals that fail to address out out-of-control spending\u201d and the threat of cutting services. Portman spokeswoman Christyn Lansing said the senator and his staff \u201care working to get a vote on it as soon as possible.\u201d\n\n\u201cSen. Portman has always said that Americans should not have the threat of a government shutdown hanging over their heads,\u201d Lansing said. \u201cHe will continue to push for a vote on his legislation that would prevent government shutdowns and save taxpayer dollars.\u201d\n\nThis article contains reporting from the Associated Press.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A government shutdown Oct.", "og": {"url": "http://www.journal-news.com/news/news/possible-government-shutdown-could-impact-the-poor/nnnLN/", "image": "http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/img/photos/2015/09/24/21/8d/111213-hunger2.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "A government shutdown Oct.", "title": "Possible government shutdown could impact \u2018the poorest among us\u2019"}, "twitter": {"site": "@journalnews", "image": "http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/lt/lt_cache/resize/120x120/img/photos/2015/09/24/21/8d/111213-hunger2.jpg", "description": "A government shutdown Oct. 1 could immediately suspend or delay food stamp payments to some of the more than 44,000 Butler County residents who receive the food aid.", "card": "summary", "title": "Possible government shutdown could impact \u2018the poorest among us\u2019"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "journal-news", "vr": {"canonical": "http://www.journal-news.com/news/news/possible-government-shutdown-could-impact-the-poor/nnnLN/"}, "cmg_revpath": "/re/292/3075314/news/news/possible-government-shutdown-could-impact-the-poor/nnnLN/", "keywords": "Butler County,politics,HJNhomepage", "google-site-verification": "4Q9_13tOch6eLcVYCHatUepAlnmJQbgHMCB16qdjcy0", "news_keywords": "Butler County, politics, HJNhomepage"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdec64\"", "article_summary": "The impact of that 2013 shutdown was felt by millions of Americans who weren\u2019t able to receive their monthly food assistance benefits.\nThe process has been complicated because of a battle over federal funding for Planned Parenthood and the group\u2019s involvement in the practice of procuring tissue from aborted fetuses for research purposes.\nPortman has always said that Americans should not have the threat of a government shutdown hanging over their heads,\u201d Lansing said.\nOhio Department of Job and Family Services spokesman Ben Johnson said the impact on Ohio is right now unknown.\n\u201cWe\u2019re monitoring very closely but it\u2019s too early to say what, if any, impact would be,\u201d he said."}
