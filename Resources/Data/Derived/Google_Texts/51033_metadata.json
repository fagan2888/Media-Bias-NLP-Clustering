Together, as J.P. Morgan economist Michael Feroli noted in a research report on Thursday, the two states have accounted for more than 90 percent of production growth over the past five years. Texas alone is responsible for 67 percent of the nation\u2019s increase in crude production over that time span, and the state\u2019s share of total U.S. output has surged to more than 40 percent.\n\nThat oil boom helped spur economic growth that leaders like former Gov. Rick Perry touted as a \u201cTexas miracle.\u201d The state\u2019s economy shrank by an inflation-adjusted 0.5 percent in 2009 but then grew by an annual average of 4.5 percent over the next four years, far outpacing the tepid 2 percent yearly average for country as a whole. While the state\u2019s unemployment rate got as high as 8.3 percent in early 2010, the Texas job market recovered more quickly than the national one did. \u201cThe construction crane could easily be declared the state bird,\u201d the Dallas Morning News quipped in one recent editorial.\n\nRelated: Early Slowdown Signs Emerge for U.S. Oil States on Crude Slide\n\nThe price of crude has plunged some 50 percent since the summer, though, placing the U.S. oil industry in a precarious position \u2014 and threatening to turn that Texas boom into a recessionary bust just as other states are finally enjoying stronger recoveries and consumers across the country are starting to benefit from cheaper fuel prices.\n\n\u201cWhile we expect the country, overall, will be a net beneficiary from falling oil prices, two states look like they will bear the brunt of the pain: North Dakota and Texas,\u201d J.P.Morgan economist Michael Feroli wrote Thursday in a research note titled \u2014 what else? \u2014 \u201cHouston, you have a problem.\u201d\n\nWhile the oil sector represents a larger portion of the North Dakota economy than it does in Texas, the Texas economy is more than 25 times bigger. \u201cGiven its much larger size,\u201d Feroli wrote, \u201cthe prospect of a recession in Texas could have some broader reverberations.\u201d\n\nTo get a sense of just how damaging those reverberations might be, Feroli looked back to 1986, when oil prices also collapsed by about 50 percent. In that case, the state\u2019s unemployment rate shot up by 2 percentage points in just a few months, and the regional real estate market fell into a more prolonged skid that left prices 14 percent below their peak by late 1988, even as the national housing market rose 14 percent. \u201cThe last act of this tragedy was a banking crisis, as several hundred Texas banks failed, with peak failures occurring in 1988 and 1989,\u201d Feroli wrote.\n\nRelated: New U.S. Oil and Gas Well November Permits Tumble Nearly 40 Percent\n\nYes, much has changed in Texas and the U.S. since the mid-1980s. Feroli notes, for example, that natural gas prices haven\u2019t plunged in sympathy with crude oil this year as they did in 1986. And the sector accounts for a smaller share of total jobs in the state than it did 30 years ago. Even so, the Texas economy is about equally as reliant on the oil and energy sector now as it was then.\n\n\u201cAs we weigh the evidence, we think Texas will, at the least, have a rough 2015 ahead, and is at risk of slipping into a regional recession,\u201d Feroli said. That in turn could again cool off the hot Texas housing market, for one thing. Yet there\u2019s little reason right now to fear that it will translate into nationwide weakness: \u201cThe national economy performed quite well in 1986, in spite of the Texas recession.\u201d\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "There could be trouble bubbling up in Texas.", "title": "Collapsing Oil Prices Could Really Mess with Texas", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2014/12/19/Collapsing-Oil-Prices-Could-Really-Mess-Texas", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/11142011_oil_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2014/12/19/Collapsing-Oil-Prices-Could-Really-Mess-Texas", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/11142011_oil_article.jpg", "creator": "@yuvalrosenberg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "There could be trouble bubbling up in Texas.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc058\"", "article_summary": "\u2014 \u201cHouston, you have a problem.\u201dWhile the oil sector represents a larger portion of the North Dakota economy than it does in Texas, the Texas economy is more than 25 times bigger.\nEven so, the Texas economy is about equally as reliant on the oil and energy sector now as it was then.\nFeroli notes, for example, that natural gas prices haven\u2019t plunged in sympathy with crude oil this year as they did in 1986.\nThe U.S. oil boom has largely been a story about North Dakota and Texas.\nThat in turn could again cool off the hot Texas housing market, for one thing."}
