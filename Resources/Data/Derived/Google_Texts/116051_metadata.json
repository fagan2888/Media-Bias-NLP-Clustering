Gov. Chris Christie says, but it\u2019s a train wreck that even a newbie politico could have predicted.\n\n\u201cThis is a disaster, and it was a train wreck that anybody who\u2019s managed anything, ever, in their lives could\u2019ve seen coming,\u201d Mr. Christie said to New Jersey 101.5 FM.\n\nBut he was just getting warmed up.\n\nSPECIAL COVERAGE: Health Care Reform\n\nPolitico reported he went on: \u201cThis is just an awful law. It made no sense and that\u2019s why I didn\u2019t get into a state exchange. And no, I have absolutely no regrets. In fact, I\u2019m really glad that the train wreck\u2019s not mine. It\u2019s [President Obama\u2019s,]\u201d and Mr. Obama is now \u201cscrambling.\u201d\n\nWhy?\n\nHe\u2019s up the creek without a paddle on promises that Americans could keep their insurance plans if they wanted.\n\n\u201cThis entire Obamacare program is a failure,\u201d Mr. Christie said in the Politico report. \u201cIt\u2019s a failure and people are seeing it starkly and clearly right now and the president is scrambling. He should\u2019ve just told people the truth from the beginning, but you know what if he had \u2014 they wouldn\u2019t have passed it. Not even Democrats would\u2019ve passed this.\u201d\n\nMr. Christie, the newly minted chairman of the Republican Governors Association, is a much-touted possible GOP nominee for president in 2016. He\u2019s been a moderate conservative on many policies, such as climate change \u2014 and a vocal supporter of the president during the Superstorm Sandy devastation that hit New Jersey.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Not only is Obamacare a \"train wreck,\" N.J.
