The capital is expected to help Phreesia expand its tablet product across the U.S. The New York-based company provides electronic payment services and data management to health care companies in order to streamline workflow.

Phreesia was advised by law firm Goodwin Procter LLP and investment bank Baird Capital.

The transaction is the latest in a continuing stream of health care tech deals.
