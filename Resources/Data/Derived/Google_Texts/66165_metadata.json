Had medical bills you couldn\u2019t pay in the past two years? Been a victim of domestic violence? Received a shut-off notice from a utility company? If you don\u2019t want to buy insurance under Obamacare, you don\u2019t have to. No penalty.\n\nThe individual mandate may be the most despised part of Obamacare, but the reality is that it\u2019s much smaller than people think. It\u2019s riddled with exemptions, hardships and other loopholes that allow millions of people off the hook for enrollment by March 31.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nSome exceptions are part of the law. Some were added to quell political fires.\n\nIf you had a plan that was canceled and think the alternative costs too much, you get a pass. And it\u2019s not an out just for this first rough year. According to a decision this month by the administration, you may be able to escape the obligation of the mandate for the rest of the Obama presidency \u2014 if you can deal with the paperwork.\n\n( PHOTOS: Obamacare in the Mississippi Delta)\n\nIf you are one of the several million low-income people who would qualify for Medicaid expansion \u2014 but your state opted out of expansion \u2014 you won\u2019t be required to buy coverage.\n\nThese and other changes to the mandate encapsulate many of the challenges the administration has faced during the four years of implementation since the Affordable Care Act law was passed.\n\nThe White House needs the mandate to make its policies work, as it creates new insurance markets operating under new rules.\n\nIt needs the exemptions to make the politics work \u2014 or at least to take the edge off some of the sharpest political backlash, like the outcry over the canceled plans that people had been told they could keep.\n\n( PHOTOS: 20 quotes: More Obamacare, less work)\n\nFrom the start, the Affordable Care Act mandate \u2014 or as the White House calls it, \u201cthe individual shared responsibility\u201d \u2014 had outs. People who really couldn\u2019t afford health care wouldn\u2019t have to buy it under criteria spelled out in the law. Polls have shown that the message never got through to large portions of the population, and the anger over the mandate combined with objections to the costs contributed to the persistent antagonism to the \u201cgovernment intrusion\u201d of the law.\n\nRejection of the mandate animated the tea party, sparked the Supreme Court challenge, was a pivot point in the government shutdown and led to multiple House GOP votes to repeal or delay it, including votes just this month.\n\nBut the breadth of the exemptions could cause other problems. There\u2019s that three-year allowance for canceled plans. And there\u2019s hardship exemption No. 14: \u201cYou experienced another hardship in obtaining health insurance. Please submit documentation if possible.\u201d\n\n( PHOTOS: 25 unforgettable Obamacare quotes)\n\nThe Republicans are gleefully claiming that if the administration is handing get-out-of-mandate free cards to anybody who wants one, the Democrats should join them and repeal the darn thing.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a real question whether the White House has abandoned the individual mandate \u2014 the heart of Obamacare itself,\u201d House Speaker John Boehner said recently. \u201cThe White House quietly added a new hardship exemption for everyone, and it seems like they\u2019re hoping no one will notice.\u201d\n\nHealth law backers say the GOP is exaggerating the changes, but that doesn\u2019t mean some aren\u2019t worrying about whether it\u2019s been too watered down. Tim Jost, a well-known health lawyer who backs the law, said the vagueness of some exemptions troubles him.\n\n\u201cCan I say, \u2018I don\u2019t like the options available,\u2019 or \u2018I\u2019d rather spend my money on whatever,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cI just don\u2019t understand where they are going with these very wide-open hardship exemptions, and I think they are opening the door to some real mischief.\u201d\n\nInsurers, which priced their policies based on the expectation that the mandate will drive otherwise reluctant (and relatively healthy) people into their plans, are watching closely for any further erosion. Premiums could soar without healthy customers to balance the cost of covering sicker people with pre-existing conditions, now required by law.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "The individual mandate may be the most hated part of Obamacare, but it's smaller than you think.", "title": "Honey, I shrunk the mandate", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2014/03/shrinking-obamacare-mandate-104966.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2014/03/24/140324_shrinking_mandate_cartoon_wuerker1.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Obamacare,Health Care,Affordable Care Act,Individual Mandate", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "The individual mandate may be the most hated part of Obamacare, but it's smaller than you think.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "The White House needs the mandate to make its policies work, as it creates new insurance markets operating under new rules.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a real question whether the White House has abandoned the individual mandate \u2014 the heart of Obamacare itself,\u201d House Speaker John Boehner said recently.\nMatt Wuerker Honey, I shrunk the mandateFiled for bankruptcy in the past six months?\n( PHOTOS: 20 quotes: More Obamacare, less work)From the start, the Affordable Care Act mandate \u2014 or as the White House calls it, \u201cthe individual shared responsibility\u201d \u2014 had outs.\nThe individual mandate may be the most despised part of Obamacare, but the reality is that it\u2019s much smaller than people think."}
