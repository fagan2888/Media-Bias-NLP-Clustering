Tim Kaine (D-VA), a Democrat who\u2019s angling for this in the deal, said according to Politico. \u201cA lot of [the meeting] was to talk about that very question of: What is a sufficient assurance?\u201d\n\nPolitico reports that such a discussion happened at the White House between so-called pro-Obamatrade Democrats and President Barack Obama.\n\n\u201cAt the White House on Wednesday, pro-trade Democrats and Obama discussed the possibility of sticking together as a bloc so they can get TPA, TAA, a customs enforcement and perhaps an extension of the Export-Import Bank charter, which lapses at the end of the month,\u201d Politico wrote late Wednesday.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, Sen. Maria Cantwell (D-WA)\u2014and Rep. Gerry Connolly (D-VA)\u2014also confirmed the effort to sneak the Export-Import Bank reauthorization into the deal when it hits the Senate.\n\n\u201cRep. Gerald Connolly (D-VA) said Sen. Maria Cantwell (D-WA) and a \u2018small group\u2019 of Democratic senators who voted last month to renew TPA made \u2018very clear\u2019 in a June 16 meeting with House Democrats that they will support a standalone TPA only if they can get a vote on Ex-Im reauthorization,\u201d Inside U.S. Trade, a high-value trade subscription-only publication for beltway insiders, wrote on Wednesday. \u201cConnolly said for these \u2018handful\u2019 of Senate Democrats the Ex-Im issue seemed more important than the passage of TAA.\u201d\n\nInside U.S. Trade then quoted Connolly and Sen. Dick Durbin (D-IL), a top Senate Democrat and Minority Leader Harry Reid\u2019s number two, as saying Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has agreed to the secretive effort.\n\n\u201cThey were more focused frankly on the outstanding commitment to have a vote on Ex-Im that has not yet materialized,\u201d Connolly said of Cantwell\u2019s and other Democrats\u2019 apparent commitment from McConnell to use Obamatrade\u2019s Trade Promotion Authority as a tool to get Ex-Im reauthorization.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s supposed to get a vote here in the Senate,\u201d Durbin added, talking about Cantwell. \u201cThe best they\u2019ve come up with was, what, last week when Sens. [Mark] Kirk and [Kelly] Ayotte came up with a momentary procedural vote followed by a quick withdrawal of the amendment. That\u2019s not going to save the Ex-Im Bank.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the Inside U.S. Trade article notes that McConnell \u201cpledged to Cantwell\u201d while considering Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) to fast-track at least three of Obama\u2019s highly secretive foreign trade deals and the attached Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) bill \u201cthat she could offer up an Ex-Im reauthorization bill on the Senate floor in June.\u201d\n\n\u201cMcConnell has since taken the position that this commitment was fulfilled when senators supporting Ex-Im reauthorization staged a \u2018show vote\u2019 to demonstrate strong support when they proposed it as an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA),\u201d Inside U.S. Trade wrote. \u201cSupporters successfully defeated a motion to table the amendment, but subsequently withdrew it.\u201d\n\n\u201c[McConnell] had told Sen. Cantwell earlier this month that he would agree to an Ex-Im amendment, and they had that vote last week on Ex-Im,\u201d a Senate aide told Inside U.S. Trade, a reference to the NDAA show vote before adding that in the words of Inside U.S. Trade\u2019s paraphrasing of the aide: \u201cCantwell is free to propose an Ex-Im reauthorization bill as an amendment to any bill that moves on the Senate floor.\u201d\n\nThat means, technically, that Export Import bank reauthorization could come up on TPA if and when it comes up in the Senate\u2014should the House pass a newly cooked up effort by House Ways and Means Committee chairman Rep. Paul Ryan (R-WI) on Thursday. It also means\u2014strangely enough as even Ryan says he opposes Ex-Im\u2014that any House member voting for TPA on Thursday could be voting to inadvertently and accidentally pave a way for Ex-Im to be reauthorized.\n\nThe dangerous and tricky strategy by leadership\u2014filled with complicated inside-the-beltway procedural chaos\u2014comes after last week Ryan\u2019s efforts to push President Obama\u2019s biggest second-term priority were shattered by a coalition of House conservatives and Democrats. The House, which tried to push under Ryan\u2019s leadership through a Senate-passed package of TPA and TAA, failed to get enough votes for TAA and barely passed TPA.\n\nTPA would fast track congressional approval of three highly secretive trade deals: the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP), Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (T-TIP) and the Trade in Services Agreement (TiSA). TPA pretty much guarantees Congressional certification of each, since no trade deal started on fast track in the history of fast track in the U.S. has ever been defeated. TPP text is currently being held in the basement of the U.S. Capitol in a secure room where only members of Congress can read it, and only staff with high enough security clearances are allowed in and only with members. TPP would, according to Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-AL), create a new \u201cPacific Union\u201d that cedes U.S. sovereignty to a new global commission\u2014and it contains all sorts of various progressive priorities like immigration matters, climate change handouts to the left, and more, not to mention the fact that inside the Pacific Rim text there is what is called a \u201cliving agreement\u201d which means changes, including the addition of nations like China, to the deal can be made without ever running it back by Congress. A top Australian official confirmed on Wednesday, too, that the deal is just a week from finalization meaning that Congress will get no say in the crafting of the deal so technically a vote for TPA is a vote for TPP.\n\nMuch less, as Sessions noted in a statement late Wednesday, is known about the even more secretive T-TIP and TiSA deals. T-TIP is expected to be similar to TPP in nature, while TiSA is a deal with more than 20 different nations and global entities including the European Union. Documents from TiSA that leaked on Wikileaks show that it would substantially change the way the United States handles several policy issues, including but not limited to healthcare and immigration. The text of both TiSA and T-TIP are currently being kept secret from even members of Congress and their staffs, which Sessions noted means every member of Congress who voted for TPA has no idea what they have actually done.\n\nTo secure Democratic support in the Senate, pro-Obamatrade forces had to attach TAA\u2014which is essentially a big government handout program that is meant to offset the job losses that will happen with any foreign trade agreement the U.S. enters into. The package passed the Senate a few weeks ago, and then when it came up in the House, Democrats\u2014under the leadership of Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi\u2014there turned on TAA as a means of killing the entire package after conservatives failed in a nearly successful effort to take down a rule and kill it all on a procedural vote.\n\nTAA failed enormously in the House, losing 302-126, and after that vote Ryan, Speaker John Boehner, Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy and Majority Whip Steve Scalise jammed through a then-meaningless TPA vote 219-211. It became apparent after that vote that to try to get TAA through the House because of controversial measures inside the Senate-passed version of that program, Boehner and Ryan changed a pay-for structure to include a tax increase nearly identical to one Boehner previously called one of Washington\u2019s \u201cdumbest ideas\u201d when he got it repealed out of Obamacare in 2011. Americans for Tax Reform (ATR), an organization for which nearly every elected Republican in America has signed a pledge against raising taxes, previously called the nearly identical tax inserted into Obamatrade a tax\u2014even though it\u2019s now, since Ryan supports it at this time, is calling the tax not a tax but still opposes the TAA program\u2014meaning the 86 Republicans leadership tricked into voting for TAA all violated the pledges they took against raising taxes.\n\nThe political toxicity around Obamatrade has taken over the 2016 election cycle, hurting proponents like Sens. Ted Cruz (R-TX), Marco Rubio (R-FL) and Lindsey Graham (R-SC) and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush. Outsider candidates like Donald Trump, Carly Fiorina, Dr. Ben Carson, Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY), former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum, Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal and more have all gained traction substantially on the trail due to their opposition to Ryan\u2019s Obamatrade. On the Democratic side, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton\u2014the likely presumptive future nominee\u2014was forced due to the bipartisan unpopularity of this deal to come out against it joining Pelosi after former Maryland Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley and Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, her two opponents, have been vehemently opposed to Obamatrade from the beginning. Clinton, who helped negotiate TPP as it\u2019s been under way for at least six years, previously supported this program.\n\nIt appeared Obamatrade was dead forever after the House shot down TAA, but a determined Ryan and Boehner\u2014working alongside McConnell and Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn on the other side of the Capitol\u2014convened a series of secret meetings that included Cornyn, Ryan, McCarthy, Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-UT), Boehner himself, and House Energy and Commerce Committee chairman Rep. Fred Upton (R-MI), among others. In those meetings, they devised a scheme by which to bring Obamatrade back to life and sneak it past unsuspecting Americans nationwide.\n\nThe crux of their ploy is as follows: The House will vote on Thursday on TPA as a standalone measure. If that passes, the Senate will take up a standalone TPA as well. The president, who wants to sneak his secret trade deals past Congress to cement his legacy as soon as possible, would presumably sign TPA immediately.\n\nAfter all that, they say the House and Senate would each pass TAA and the president would sign that too. Boehner and McConnell issued a joint statement publicly on Thursday guaranteeing they would pass TAA. They also say they would pass a separate customs bill that supposedly\u2014but it\u2019s unclear if it actually does\u2014has protections against using trade for immigration purposes.\n\n\u201cWe are committed to ensuring both TPA and TAA get votes in the House and Senate and are sent to the President for signature,\u201d Boehner and McConnell said. \u201cAnd it is our intent to have a conference on the customs bill and complete that in a timely manner so that the President can sign it into law.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s several problems with the guarantee they made, as the New York Times noted.\n\n\u201cTrade Bill\u2019s Fate Rests on What\u2019s Been Missing in Congress: Trust,\u201d read a headline from Times reporter Jennifer Steinhauer on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cPro-trade Democrats in the Senate now find themselves in a place of both power and panic as they weigh whether to help Republicans retaliate against House Democrats, all the while trusting those same Republicans to help pass the worker assistance program,\u201d Steinhauer wrote.\n\nThere\u2019s a strong likelihood, especially if TAA contains a tax increase again as the pay-for, that Republican opposition in the GOP-controlled Congress would be enough to kill the measure. There\u2019s also a strong likelihood that with the customs bill, if it does as some proponents argue limit President Obama\u2019s immigration power as an executive, that the president would veto it\u2014or that the more-open-to-amnesty-policies Senate would reject it, despite doe-eyed promises from the eager Ryan.\n\nWith all that in mind, and a razor-thin margin for error from Ryan after the purely-for-show TPA measure barely passed the House 219-211 last week, there\u2019s a strong possibility that with just enough grassroots pressure in the final hours of this Obamatrade fiasco that TPA could fail on Thursday. It\u2019s expected that anti-amnesty organization Numbers USA will activate its 3 million grassroots activists nationwide on Thursday morning to call their congressmen to kill this bill, and there\u2019s a few weak links in leadership\u2019s expectations\u2014and if the 54 Republicans who voted against TPA last week hold strong, though nothing is certain, it may go down on Thursday with enough pressure on select members.\n\nA few who could change their previous pro-TPA votes to oppose it under these new and even more unpopular include Reps. Ron DeSantis (R-FL), Bradley Byrne (R-AL), Lou Barletta (R-PA), Brian Babin (R-TX), Rod Blum (R-IA), Trent Franks (R-AZ), David Schweikert (R-AZ), Jody Hice (R-GA), Barry Loudermilk (R-GA), Gus Bilirakis (R-FL), Martha Roby (R-AL), Mike Rogers (R-AL), Ed Whitfield (R-KY), John Fleming (R-LA), Ralph Abraham (R-LA) or Ryan Zinke (R-MT), among others.\n\nDeSantis, who\u2019s running for Senate in Florida, would likely lose substantial grassroots support\u2014which is necessary to get through what\u2019s likely to be a bruising primary against Lt. Gov. Carlos Lopez Cantera\u2014if he votes for this, and he\u2019d also if he does win the primary get hammered by Democrat Rep. Patrick Murphy, his likely opponent, because Murphy voted against this deal the first go-around and is likely to oppose it again. DeSantis\u2019 office did not respond to a request for comment, so it\u2019s unclear what\u2019s going through his mind, but several other prominent Florida delegation Republicans opposed TPA the first time including Reps. Daniel Webster (R-FL), Ted Yoho (R-FL), Richard Nugent (R-FL), Curt Clawson (R-FL) and more so they\u2019re likely to be putting the pressure on DeSantis and Bilirakis among others from the delegation.\n\nByrne, Roby and Rogers are from the Alabama delegation\u2014which Sen. Sessions and Sen. Richard Shelby (R-AL) represent, the only pair of Republican U.S. Senators from a state that together opposed Obamatrade in the Senate, and Reps. Gary Palmer (R-AL) and Robert Aderholt (R-AL) oppose Obamatrade too. Roby\u2019s likely to face a tough primary challenge from nationally-acclaimed Tea Party activist Becky Gerritson\u2014who has testified before Congress due to Obama\u2019s IRS targeting her Wetumpka Tea Party\u2014too, and a vote from her for TPA would fuel that fire.\n\nBarletta, Blum and Fleming might change their yes votes on TPA from before due to the fact that Obamatrade is going to empower the president on immigration according to Sen. Sessions as could Abraham. Zinke might flip because he previously opposed TPA because it gave too much power to Obama to negotiate with foreign countries\u2014which alarmed him after the Iran and Cuba deals\u2014but he voted for TPA after getting a minor amendment in the process which might have been obliterated in this new leadership crafted Obamatrade concoction and due to all of Ryan\u2019s misleading statements on this matter.\n\nFreshmen Loudermilk, Hice and Babin\u2014after falling through on several promises to their districts including on the vote regarding Speaker Boehner\u2019s re-election at the beginning of this Congress\u2014may turn due to increased pressure from their districts. After promising on the campaign trail last year they\u2019d vote for a Boehner alternative for Speaker, Loudermilk and Hice both voted for Boehner\u2014while Babin simply voted \u201cpresent\u201d instead of for one of the alternative candidates like Rep. Louie Gohmert (R-TX), Webster or others.\n\nThere\u2019s always also the possibility that Rep. Marlin Stutzman (R-IN), who voted for TPA after opposing the rule last week, votes against it on Thursday due to the process. Radio\u2019s Mark Levin highlighted Stutzman\u2019s altercation with leadership back late last year during the vote on the so-called \u201cCRomnibus\u201d spending bill in a post on his Facebook page on Thursday.\n\n\u201cThe TPA boondoggle is back and I am told that John Boehner is telling the GOP members that if they vote to pass the TPA, a bill later with restrictions on immigration, among other things, will be passed to reign in Obama\u2019s actions,\u201d Levin wrote on Facebook. \u201cBoehner pulled the same trick against Congressman Marlin Stutzman not long ago, when Kevin McCarthy promised if he voted to let the massive budget bill go to the House floor, the GOP leadership would replace the bill on the floor with a smaller spending bill. But McCarthy lied to Stutzman. The leadership did no such thing. They delivered their massive spending bill to Obama, who quickly signed it. MEANWHILE, Obama is telling the Democrats in Congress to vote for TPA because it will allow him to finish his last year and a half unrestrained by the Republicans. In other words, he will run wild using the trade bill to institute left-wing agenda items. (Remember, the trade deal could not be amended by congressional Republicans.) So, when Obama, Boehner, and McConnell huddled this week to come up with a plan to push TPA through Congress, clearly they decided that lying to members of Congress and deceiving the American people was the way to win the vote.\u201d\n\nSome Republicans from the more liberal side of the party may go against it as well for other reasons like promises Ryan has apparently made on other parts of this as well.\n\nThere\u2019s also high likelihood that pro-Obamatrade forces will lose several of the 28 Democrats who voted for TPA last week due to the fact that TAA is now separated entirely\u2014and despite pledges from Boehner and McConnell, there\u2019s a strong likelihood the GOP-controlled Congress will shoot down TAA later. At least a handful of those Democrats are likely to vote against it now, but even more could oppose it.\n\nOf course, there\u2019s also a possibility it may break the exact opposite way and more members vote for TPA. With no margin for error, it remains to be seen what exactly will go down in what\u2019s likely to be one of the most dramatic votes in years in Congress.\n\n\u201cThe extraordinary lengths that leadership has gone to push through fast track demonstrates just how hard it would be to defeat an agreement submitted under these rules,\u201d Rick Manning, the president of Americans for Limited Government, said in an email. \u201cShould fast track be approved, Republican members who voted to give President Obama this power will regret the decision as they are forced to deal with non-amendable treaties that undermine their own powers, and strike at the heart of how our representative democracy is supposed to work. Very few times will they get to vote on big issues where the true future of what the world will look like in the decades ahead. Should fast track pass, Congress will have abdicated having the true and robust discussion that Obama\u2019s TPA, TTIP and TISA deserve.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s more, if Obamatrade fails, Ryan\u2019s credibility will take a probably irreparable shot. If it somehow passes, it\u2019ll most likely become the biggest issue of the 2016 election cycle\u2013and may spark a rebellion against Washington even bigger than the one Obamacare sparked in 2010.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Team Obamatrade Planning Tricky Effort to Sneak Export-Import Bank Reauthorization into Deal", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Team Obamatrade Planning Tricky Effort to Sneak Export-Import Bank Reauthorization into Deal", "title": "Team Obamatrade Planning Tricky Effort to Sneak Export-Import Bank Reauthorization into Deal - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 2592, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/06/WireAP_1cecc912e11a4f85a246db372983cba8.jpg", "height": 1890}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/06/18/team-obamatrade-planning-tricky-effort-to-sneak-export-import-bank-reauthorization-into-deal/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Team Obamatrade Planning Tricky Effort to Sneak Export-Import Bank Reauthorization into Deal", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/06/WireAP_1cecc912e11a4f85a246db372983cba8.jpg", "title": "Team Obamatrade Planning Tricky Effort to Sneak Export-Import Bank Reauthorization into Deal - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Jeff Sessions, Obamatrade, Paul Ryan, Trade Promotion Authority, Trans Pacific Partnership,2016 Presidential Race, Big Government,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "2016 Presidential Race", "tag": "Trans Pacific Partnership", "published_time": "2015-06-18T02:46:02-07:00", "categories": "Big Government,2016 Presidential Race"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "In other words, he will run wild using the trade bill to institute left-wing agenda items.\nWhat\u2019s more, Sen.
