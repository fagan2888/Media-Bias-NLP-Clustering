Until recently, you could have put the EU in that elite category reserved for too-big-to-fail institutions. But not anymore. In the simplest terms, Europe\u2019s long-held ambition to unify like-minded democracies is failing.\n\nOnly a few months ago the EU\u2019s standoff with Greece counted among the worst crises to befall the union since its earliest postwar days. Now it faces a British crisis, a migration crisis, and an emerging Turkish crisis.\n\nAll three took turns for the worse in a matter of days last week.\n\nRelated: Exclusive: EU Set to Suspend Belarus Sanctions for Four Months After Vote\n\nWe had a glimpse of things to come during those critical moments in Greece last summer. Who wasn\u2019t stunned as Brussels and Berlin effectively told Greek voters that economic reforms demanded by unelected technocrats in Brussels mattered more than the democratic process in a member state?\n\nThe EU as an institution isn\u2019t going anywhere, and the architecture of unity is starting to crumble .\n\nWhat those events suggested is now the emerging reality. The EU as an institution isn\u2019t going anywhere\u2014huge bureaucracies rarely do\u2014but the admirable ideals are drying up, and the architecture of unity is starting to crumble.\n\nWill the EU become the institutional equivalent of Mt. Everest in years to come\u2014it\u2019s there \u201cbecause it\u2019s there?\u201d Depressing thought, but maybe. \u201cThe EU has become a sham,\u201d Simon Jenkins, a British columnist wrote over the weekend in The Guardian.\n\nIndeed, if 2015 is any guide, the EU may eventually endure because (1) too many people make a living by it, (2) the failure of Europe\u2019s loftiest ambitions is simply too painful to acknowledge, and (3) its place in the Western alliance\u2019s strategic thinking has always been at least as important as its founding principles.\n\nRelated: With Brexit deadlines tight, EU-UK talks start slow\n\nThis may seem an odd time to ring somber bells for the great European experiment. On Saturday, the Greek parliament voted\u2014by a narrow margin, it must be said\u2014to accept the European Union\u2019s controversial package of austerity reforms. A third bailout, worth $98 billion, will now go ahead, and the crisis that has long plagued the EU begins to recede.\n\nThink again, if this is your view. First, given the months of strong-arming and intimidation that led to Greece\u2019s legislative assent, the EU\u2019s \u201csuccess\u201d needs the quotation marks if you happen to think democratic procedure is a good idea.\n\nBritish Prime Minister David Cameron promised a list of demands Brussels must meet to avoid \u201cBrexit\u201d\u2014Britain\u2019s withdrawal from the union.\n\nBeyond Greece, problems of comparable magnitude worsen elsewhere. Here are three pressing on the EU now:\n\n\u2022 After stonewalling the rest of the EU for months, British Prime Minister David Cameron promised last Thursday to present a list of demands Brussels must meet to avoid \u201cBrexit\u201d\u2014Britain\u2019s withdrawal from the union.\n\nThis list is due in a few weeks in anticipation of a potentially decisive summit in December. Cameron promises a national referendum on the membership question by the end of 2017, and there\u2019s talk in London now that he could call it as early as next September.\n\nRelated: Merkel Says Turkey Key to Solving Europe's Refugee Crisis\n\nAs the in-or-out campaigning begins among Britons, it doesn\u2019t look good for Cameron. The Conservatives big win in elections earlier this year empowered extreme-right Tories and other Euroskeptics. The prime minister\u2019s now squeezed between them and European leaders such as German Chancellor Angela Merkel.\n\nThe Financial Times reported over the weekend that Cameron\u2019s November list is unlikely to include three demands his Tea Party equivalents say are essential. These all return sovereignty to Britain on questions such as trade and in-migration, and Merkel has already declared them beyond negotiation.\n\nBest outcome: After at least a year of noisy, intensifying political strain Britain remains an EU member but on altered terms\u2014potentially setting a troublesome precedent. Worst: The EU loses its most influential member.\n\nThe flood of arrivals this year has tested the EU\u2019s concept of unity and found it weak.\n\n\n\n\u2022 After a vigorous struggle toward a common policy on refugees and migrants from the Middle East and North Africa, the flood of arrivals this year has tested the EU\u2019s concept of unity and found it weak. This is especially critical among newer members on the EU\u2019s eastern flank, notably Hungary.\n\nRelated: Turkey Presents EU With Wish List to Help It Stem Migration\n\nOn Sunday, Brussels said that next March it would propose a plan to resettle 200,000 migrants via a union-wide scheme. Fine, but in good news lies bad: This is seriously out of whack with the volume of arrivals, which by the official count alone now number nearly half a million.\n\nAs if reaching for ironic effect, Hungary simultaneously reimposed controls on its border with Slovenia \u2014having closed all crossings from Croatia last Friday. One of the ornaments of European unity, the system of open borders established by the Schengen Convention, is effectively reversed. (Hungary and Slovenia are Schengen signatories; Croatia isn\u2019t.)\n\nEither the EU has just been landed with a highly visible disciplinary case or it declares Hungary an administrative exception\u2014and risks turning Schengen into a house of cards. What good is \u201cunity,\u201d you have to ask, if it evaporates when challenged.\n\n\u2022 Turkey\u2019s cooperation in managing the migrant crisis is key, but the price exacted by Recip Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, Turkey\u2019s authoritarian prime minister, is getting too steep. Broadly speaking, Erdo\u011fan demands that the EU reinvigorate long-running but inconclusive talks on Turkish membership.\n\nRelated: Merkel Urges Europe to Protect External Borders Amid Refugee Crisis\n\n\u201cGermany is ready,\u201d Merkel declared after talks with Erdo\u011fan in Istanbul on Sunday. Nothing could be less appropriate in view of Erdo\u011fan\u2019s nasty record of political abuses.\n\nLast week, EU member states offered an aid package worth $3.4 billion to help stem the flow of refugees from Syria and manage 2.5 million who have already arrived. Now Brussels is weighing whether to grant Turks automatic visa status under Schengen rules, the FT reports.\n\nActually, this is less appropriate: Brussels has just decided to quash a report critical of Erdo\u011fan\u2019s free-speech record, according to an FT report, until after Turkey holds elections in November. This favors Erdo\u011fan who has just turned his country into another sectarian battleground on the edge of the Middle East\u2019s chaos as he fights for his political survival.\n\nSupporting temporarily useful authoritarian despots\u2014has the EU come to this? It was never what the European project was supposed to be about. And it serves the union\u2019s core cause\u2014if it still matters\u2014badly.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "This has been a very bad year for the European Union.", "title": "Add \u2018Brexit\u2019 to the Immigration Crisis that Threatens Europe", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2015/10/19/Add-Brexit-Immigration-Crisis-Threatens-Europe", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/06142013_Eurozone_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2015/10/19/Add-Brexit-Immigration-Crisis-Threatens-Europe", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/06142013_Eurozone_article.jpg", "creator": "@psmith7600", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "This has been a very bad year for the European Union.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcabbd\"", "article_summary": "One of the ornaments of European unity, the system of open borders established by the Schengen Convention, is effectively reversed.\nNow it faces a British crisis, a migration crisis, and an emerging Turkish crisis.\nA third bailout, worth $98 billion, will now go ahead, and the crisis that has long plagued the EU begins to recede.\nBritish Prime Minister David Cameron promised a list of demands Brussels must meet to avoid \u201cBrexit\u201d\u2014Britain\u2019s withdrawal from the union.\nRelated: Merkel Urges Europe to Protect External Borders Amid Refugee Crisis\u201cGermany is ready,\u201d Merkel declared after talks with Erdo\u011fan in Istanbul on Sunday."}
