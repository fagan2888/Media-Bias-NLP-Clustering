It\u2019s going to be on the air at least until November.\n\nLike with any big hit, not everybody enjoyed the mid-season finale, in which Trump trumped the moderates (Ohio Gov. John Kasich) and the conservatives (Texas Sen. Ted Cruz), which took the show in a whole new direction. Some of the longtime fans are still not sure what to make of the on-air developments.\n\nSpeaker of the House Paul Ryan \u2014 who has to worry about retaining his majority and keeping the people who comprise it happy \u2014 declined to don the Trump hat. \u201cI\u2019m just not ready to do that at this point. I\u2019m not there right now,\u201d Ryan told CNN.\n\nAnd why? Because Trump failed to perform the first miracle required for GOP canonization. According to CNN, \u201cRyan said he wants Trump to unify \u2018all wings of the Republican Party and the conservative movement\u2019 and then run a campaign that will allow Americans to \u2018have something that they\u2019re proud to support and proud to be a part of. And we\u2019ve got a ways to go from here to there,\u2019 Ryan said.\u201d\n\nAh, yes we do.\n\nIn Nevada, reactions to the fan favorite ranged from \u201csure, why not?\u201d to \u201cI guess so\u201d to \u201cwhatever.\u201d\n\nBoth Reps. Cresent Hardy and Joe Heck had their spokesmen report that they will support the Republican nominee, but are focusing on their own races. It was just a few months ago that Heck was saying he didn\u2019t think Trump tropes such as building a big, magnificent wall on the Southern border or temporarily banning Muslims from entering the country were good ideas. Back in December, Heck declined to endorse Trump.\n\nIt\u2019s worth asking, if you have to hold your nose that hard, is sticking with party uber alles really worth it?\n\nU.S. Sen. Dean Heller, not up for re-election until 2018, said he wouldn\u2019t vote for Trump, but wouldn\u2019t go with Clinton, either.\n\n\u201cI vehemently oppose our nominee in some of the comments and issues that he brought up during the campaign,\u201d Heller said. \u201cThings he says about Muslims, issues he brought up about women and the Hispanic community. I just cannot agree with some of his positions. But I will tell you that I will not be voting for Hillary Clinton. I stated that early on. I will not be supporting a candidate that is nothing more than a third term of the Obama administration. So I will be looking elsewhere in November.\u201d\n\nAnd by \u201celsewhere,\u201d he doesn\u2019t mean Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson, a former New Mexico governor. Instead, Heller implied he might make use of Nevada\u2019s unique \u201cNone of these Candidates\u201d option.\n\nGov. Brian Sandoval \u2014 who\u2019s been mentioned as a potential vice presidential candidate on the Republican ticket \u2014 reluctantly endorsed Trump.\n\n\u201cNow that he [Kasich] has dropped out of the race, I plan to vote for the presumptive nominee although it is no secret that we do not agree on every issue,\u201d Sandoval said in a statement. \u201cElections are about making choices and the Democratic nominee is simply not an option.\u201d\n\nAnd why not, governor? On paper, Sandoval has more in common with Hillary Clinton than with Trump: He expanded Medicare under the Affordable Care Act, established a state-based insurance exchange, led the way on a package of education reforms and paid for it in part with a new commerce tax on businesses. If anything, Sandoval\u2019s career stands for common-sense, broad consensus, moderate solutions to vexing problems.\n\nThat sounds a lot more like Clinton than Trump, who stands for ridiculous solutions to serious problems, the kinds of things that won\u2019t work in real-world government, but sure go down easy on TV. If you don\u2019t believe it, just check the ratings.\n\nSteve Sebelius is a Review-Journal political columnist and co-host of the show PoliticsNOW, airing at 5:30 p.m. Sundays on 8NewsNow.
