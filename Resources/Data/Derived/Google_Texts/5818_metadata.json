Such schools emphasize giving students a choice in what they study and allowing kids to progress at their own pace, rather than organizing them by grades.\n\nThe schools have been deemed successful by their school boards, with enrollment and interest strong enough to not only continue offering them, but to expand.\n\nBut while Farmington is adding grade levels to its Gateway Academy next fall, Lakeville\u2019s Impact Academy is putting growth on hold. Lakeville plans to study issues like location and transportation before moving Impact into its own building in 2016-17.\n\nAt Farmington\u2019s Gateway, which serves 70 students in grades four through six, kids complete projects and use technology, including online lessons, to learn. Teachers act as advisers to guide students.\n\nIn Lakeville, Impact Academy has 180 students in kindergarten through fifth grade. The school emphasizes hands-on community service projects.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had a fantastic year,\u201d said Laura Pierce, Farmington\u2019s director of innovative programming. \u201cOur intent is to grow the school slowly and purposefully to meet the students\u2019 needs.\u201d\n\nSo far, 82 students are enrolled for next year, she said.\n\nThis has also been a strong year for Impact, as evidenced by a waiting list of 40 students, said Marilynn Smith, principal of Orchard Lake Elementary, where Impact occupies the former media center.\n\nThe Lakeville school board\u2019s approval of eventual expansion \u201cprovides an endpoint and an answer\u201d for parents who wanted to plan for the future, she said. \u201cIt allows us to find the best fit long-term in terms of a location.\u201d\n\nA committee is looking at the district\u2019s facilities and will finish by summer. The goal is to find a place that can be remodeled into the open, flexible space the school requires. The board has given Impact a $500,000 renovation budget, Smith said.\n\nFarmington officials considered finding a new space for Gateway, too, but decided its current home \u2014 several rooms in the district\u2019s Instructional Service Center \u2014 was the best fit.\n\nWhen the Farmington district created Gateway, one of its aims was \u201ccreating a school that completely aligns to our [district\u2019s] strategic plan,\u201d said Pierce.\n\nThe plan calls for embracing new ideas, encouraging collaboration, helping kids find their passion and personalizing learning environments.\n\nPierce said the school and its staff of three advisers, or teachers, are always adjusting to new challenges because \u201cevery one of our students is unique in themselves.\u201d\n\nTera Lee, a board member whose son is enrolled at Gateway, said the school has already adapted, making changes throughout the year. For instance, students now get to choose their adviser, and the school has implemented a new online math program, she said.\n\nShe said she is glad her son can stay at Gateway through middle school if he chooses.\n\nThe school continues to receive calls from other districts that are curious about Gateway Academy, Pierce said.\n\nMeasuring success\n\nThis was the second year for Impact, which added fourth and fifth grades this year.\n\nThe Lakeville school board supported the Impact Academy concept and its growth, but stopped short of expanding Impact to fill the whole Orchard Lake building. That project came with a $600,000 price tag, said Jim Skelly, board member.\n\n\u201cEverybody\u2019s at a different place when it comes to Impact Academy,\u201d Skelly said. \u201cPeople are going to have to compromise.\u201d\n\nCommittees will decide where the school should be located and whether to pay for student transportation. The district also plans to come up with criteria to measure if the program is successful, said Judy Keliher, board member.\n\nBut by many measures, supporters say Impact is already a success.\n\n\u201cI think [parents] like the option to let their kids learn at their own skill level,\u201d Keliher. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t box them in.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Both school districts tout success of new schools, but only one will grow next year.", "og": {"site_name": "Star Tribune", "description": "Both school districts tout success of new schools, but only one will grow next year.", "title": "Lakeville and Farmington 'choice schools' grow in different ways", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/lakeville-and-farmington-choice-schools-grow-in-different-ways/303182571/", "image": {"url": "http://assets.startribune.com/static/img/branding/logos/strib-social-card.png?d=1464201083", "width": 1680, "identifier": "http://assets.startribune.com/static/img/branding/logos/strib-social-card.png?d=1464201083", "height": 876}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Both school districts tout success of new schools, but only one will grow next year.", "title": "Lakeville and Farmington 'choice schools' grow in different ways", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/lakeville-and-farmington-choice-schools-grow-in-different-ways/303182571/", "image": {"src": "http://assets.startribune.com/static/img/branding/logos/strib-social-card.png?d=1464201083", "identifier": "http://assets.startribune.com/static/img/branding/logos/strib-social-card.png?d=1464201083"}, "site": "@StarTribune", "card": "summary"}, "google-site-verification": "bLXTXkzm4dJ8hcJy1LXawtxXxGP3JhInARj69uCiMiM", "article": {"tag": "Farmington Area Public Schools"}, "news_keywords": "Lakeville Area Public Schools,Farmington Area Public Schools"}, "article_summary": "But while Farmington is adding grade levels to its Gateway Academy next fall, Lakeville\u2019s Impact Academy is putting growth on hold.\nIn Lakeville, Impact Academy has 180 students in kindergarten through fifth grade.\nThe Lakeville school board supported the Impact Academy concept and its growth, but stopped short of expanding Impact to fill the whole Orchard Lake building.\nThe Lakeville school board\u2019s approval of eventual expansion \u201cprovides an endpoint and an answer\u201d for parents who wanted to plan for the future, she said.\n\u201cEverybody\u2019s at a different place when it comes to Impact Academy,\u201d Skelly said."}
