I know it doesn't feel that way, but I'm telling you, I'm telling you the American people agree with us,\u201d Biden said.\n\nHe added later: \u201cThis will pass: Trump, and that stuff that you\u2019re hearing on the other team.\u201d\n\nRelated: New Poll Shows Clinton Has Lost Her Edge Over GOP Candidates\n\nBiden\u2019s sympathetic message will likely stand in contrast to the type of attention grabbing one-liners expected at Wednesday night\u2019s Republican debate, where at least some of the ten other White House hopefuls are expected to try to take down Trump.\n\nThe billionaire has lead the GOP field on immigration, boasting he would get Mexico to pay to build a wall along the southern border, end birthright citizenship and carry out mass deportation for the illegal immigrants already in the country.\n\nHis hardline stance has forced the rest of the contenders to play catch-up, with most saying they agree with Trump\u2019s positions.\n\nBesides taking on Trump, Biden signaled the kind of optimism his might bring to the 2016 campaign, should he decide to jump into the race.\n\nRelated: Surprised Bernie Sanders Is Leading the Polls?

And whenever you give anyone in this country, regardless of where they come from, they struggled to get here or born here, they are for looking for a simple proposition \u2013 what are my possibilities? If I work I can do anything. Anything at all,\u201d Biden told the audience.\n\nHe said that \u201cgiven a chance, there is not a single person fighting to get here, particularly Latinos and Hispanics, who aren\u2019t capable of taking advantage of the possibilities here.\u201d\n\nAfter comments like that, it\u2019s hard not to imagine bumper stickers with Biden\u2019s name and the word \u201cpossibilities\u201d popping up all over the country.\n\nBut the vice president is still weighing whether or not to enter the race following the death of his son Beau to brain cancer.\n\nAt the end of his fiery remarks, the small crowd chanted, \"run, Joe, run!\"\n\nBiden replied, \"No, no, no, no.\"\n\nThen he made the sign of the cross, said \"Bless me Father,\" offered a \u201cthank you\u201d and walked away from the podium.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Vice President Joe Biden on Tuesday may discovered the panacea to counter the blistering rhetoric espoused by Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump: compassion.", "title": "Joe Biden Just Gave the Most Optimistic Speech of the 2016 Campaign", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/09/16/Joe-Biden-Just-Gave-Most-Optimistic-Speech-2016-Campaign", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-ukraine-biden_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/09/16/Joe-Biden-Just-Gave-Most-Optimistic-Speech-2016-Campaign", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-ukraine-biden_1.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Vice President Joe Biden on Tuesday may discovered the panacea to counter the blistering rhetoric espoused by Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump: compassion.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc682\"", "article_summary": "Besides taking on Trump, Biden signaled the kind of optimism his might bring to the 2016 campaign, should he decide to jump into the race.\nVice President Joe Biden on Tuesday may have discovered how to counter the blistering rhetoric coming from Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump: optimism.\nHe predicted Trump\u2019s message would ultimately fail to resonate with most of the country.\nBut the vice president is still weighing whether or not to enter the race following the death of his son Beau to brain cancer.\nSpeaking at a reception marking Hispanic Heritage Month, Biden called out the real estate mogul for his \u201cxenophobia\u201d and \u201csick message\u201d on immigration."}
