Eleven years ago, they saved up enough to build a house.\n\nTheir road is essentially an Amish highway. Horse hooves clip-clop as buggies go by.\n\nBut you can\u2019t hear them anymore. And all the animals the Brothers liked to watch? They\u2019re gone, too.\n\n\"This scared them away,\" Frank Brothers nearly shouts over the loud industrial hum as he stands in his front yard.\n\nAt his front property line, he points across the road at a natural gas compressor station, a colorful tangle of tubes and tanks \u2013 and two very big engines.\n\n\"It\u2019s been months and months since we\u2019ve seen deer here. Normally, you\u2019d see them every two days,\" he says.\n\nPipelines need compressors every 50 to 100 miles, to help move oil and gas from wells to refineries. These were built by Blue Racer Midstream, a joint venture of Caiman Energy and Dominion.\n\nThe Brothers say the 24/7 noise keeps them from opening windows or using their yard. Sometimes, the pictures on their walls rattle.\n\nWhat Blue Racer has done to their property value and quality of life isn\u2019t neighborly, but it is legal.\n\n\"The situation with townships in Ohio is that their powers to zone are very limited,\" says Todd Hunt, a land use attorney at Walter Haverfield, a Cleveland law firm. He says cities and villages can offer some protections. But state law exempts public utilities from most oversight by unincorporated townships, like the one the Brothers live in.\n\nOn interstate pipelines, compressor stations need federal review, which includes community input. The feds can set limits on nuisances like noise.\n\nBut the Brothers have fallen through a regulatory hole. They\u2019ve contacted the state EPA, the Department of Natural Resources, their township trustees, and an attorney. All have said their hands are tied.\n\nWhat\u2019s left is pleading with the company.\n\n\" I always tell them right off the bat, \u2018You know, be careful where you\u2019re putting the compressor stations,' says Jack Cera, a state representative from Belmont County. Last year, he intervened to keep Spectra Energy from putting compressors near a dozen Mt. Pleasant homes. Because the plan needed federal approval, Spectra had an incentive to listen.\n\nBut, Cera says, \"What we\u2019re seeing now are a lot of intrastate pipelines and gathering lines, which don\u2019t go through the same lengthy process. You know, that\u2019s just really starting to take off.\"\n\nCera says most companies will work with the public. But often, they don\u2019t have to.\n\nWhich brings us back to Frank and Theresa Brothers. They say calls to Blue Racer have yielded no change since the compressors started running in March. They turned down a buyout offer they say was below their property\u2019s appraised value.\n\nCompany spokeswoman Casey Nikoloric confirmed the buyout discussions, but not the offer amount.\n\n\"We\u2019re taking every step possible, within reason of course, to mitigate the noise at the site,\" she says.\n\n\"I\u2019ll be honest with you \u2013 I\u2019ve never heard of a facility that\u2019s 80 db at a residence,\" says Steve Morgan, executive vice president of Noise Solutions, an Alberta-based company whose business it is to make heavy industry quieter. He says the sound levels at the Brothers\u2019 \u2013 79 decibels at their front door, 87 at the front property line \u2013 are extreme. Significant mitigation is possible. It\u2019s just really pricey.\n\n\"It can be upwards of a million dollars for one of these sound walls to go around a facility,\" he says.\n\nThat\u2019s no doubt why Noise Solutions\u2019 business is booming. Morgan says 60 percent is from the Utica and Marcellus shale gas industry, mostly compressor stations. He says in Ohio and Pennsylvania, most of that business is voluntary \u2013 companies choosing to be better neighbors. Thirty to 40 percent is for regulatory compliance.\n\nMorgan says as the industry matures, rules on disturbances like noise likely will, too. That\u2019s already happened in Colorado.\n\nIn Ohio, he says, \"Everybody is just so happy that the jobs are coming, that, you know, it will take a little while for all those jobs to get filled and then people start to step back and go, \u2018Oh, this really is impacting us in other ways.\u2019\"\n\nThis story was supported by a fellowship from the Institute for Journalism and Natural Resources.", "article_metadata": {"description": "For many of Ohio\u2019s rural residents, the shale boom has been a godsend of money and jobs.
