Patty Murray (D-Wash.), the committee's ranking Democrat. \u201cThat would help the agency reduce its severe backlog.\u201d\n\nLawsuits a \u2018Last Resort,' EEOC Says\n\nAs part of its efforts to reduce the charge backlog, EEOC Chair Jenny Yang said the agency during fiscal 2014 hired and trained more than a hundred new frontline staff and is continuing those efforts in the current fiscal year.\n\nEfficient case management includes an emphasis on the early, successful resolution of charges, which the EEOC achieves through mediation and conciliation, she said. \u201cLitigation truly is a last resort\u201d for the agency, Yang testified.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court's decision in Mach Mining, LLC v. EEOC, 2015 BL 123508, 126 FEP Cases 1521 (U.S. 2015) , which held the agency's conciliation efforts are subject to narrow judicial review, is a \u201cpositive step forward\u201d for the EEOC and its stakeholders, Yang said. The agency is working to provide additional guidance to all its investigators on Mach Mining and its implications, she said.\n\nResponding to questions from Murray, Yang said the EEOC last year audited seven different field offices to examine the adequacy of its conciliation process. The agency in fiscal 2014 had a 38 percent success rate in conciliation, which occurs after the EEOC investigates and finds reasonable cause to believe discrimination has occurred, Yang said. That's an increase from a 27 percent conciliation success rate in earlier years, she said.\n\nIn his testimony, EEOC General Counsel P. David Lopez echoed the theme that the EEOC is focused on preventing discrimination and always tries informally to resolve bias charges before resorting to lawsuits.\n\n\u201cMost of our cases settle,\u201d either before the agency sues or after a lawsuit is filed, Lopez said. The EEOC's general counsel during fiscal 2104 successfully resolved 93 percent of its cases, and the agency from fiscal 2011 to the present has won two-thirds of the jury trials it has litigated, Lopez said.\n\nWhile courts sometimes have ruled against the EEOC, Lopez said he encourages an agency culture focused on \u201clessons learned\u201d from both winning and losing cases. That means the EEOC reviews all its litigation and makes an \u201cimmediate adjustment\u201d to any internal problems identified, he said.\n\nYang said agency investigators closed more than 80,000 discrimination charges in fiscal 2014 but almost 90,000 new charges also were filed. Through its systemic program and strategic enforcement plan, the EEOC is trying to direct its resources where the agency can do the most good, she said.\n\nThe EEOC is determined to ensure \u201cwe don't repeat the mistakes\u201d some courts have identified, Lopez said. He added, however, that despite some \u201cmissteps,\u201d the EEOC makes a \u201cpositive contribution\u201d to the mission of ensuring equal opportunity in the workplace.\n\nTexas Roadhouse Case a Flashpoint\n\nAlexander questioned Lopez about a Craigslist advertisement posted online that asked persons who thought Texas Roadhouse restaurants had refused to employ them because of age to contact the EEOC. More broadly, Alexander asked why the EEOC is soliciting complaints and suing the restaurant chain when no age bias charge has been filed and a backlog of more than 75,000 discrimination charges is pending.\n\n\u201cWe did not issue that ad,\u201d Lopez said. The EEOC neither put out the Craigslist advertisement nor contracted with anyone else to do so, Lopez said.\n\nWhen Alexander asked if the EEOC ever uses Craigslist to search for discrimination claimants, Lopez replied that as far as he knows, the agency doesn't do so.\n\nLater during the hearing, Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.) returned to the EEOC's age bias lawsuit against Texas Roadhouse, which is pending in a federal district court in Massachusetts.\n\nScott asked why the EEOC is wasting taxpayer money pursuing cases in which no individual has complained of discrimination rather than using its limited resources to work through the backlogged charges.\n\n\u201cThere seems to be a consistent pattern\u201d at the EEOC of \u201clooking for something else to do\u201d rather than investigate the individual charges, Scott said. In addition to the Texas Roadhouse litigation, Scott cited the EEOC's pending investigations of purported age bias by large accounting firms against their partners as cases in which the agency is investigating even though no individual has complained.\n\n\u201cWith respect to litigation, it\u2019s a small fraction,\u201d Lopez replied, referring to lawsuits based on an EEOC commissioner's charge instead of an individual charge. In hiring cases, an individual applicant may never know why he or she wasn't selected, he added.\n\nRegarding Texas Roadhouse in particular, Lopez said, \u201cThere is a lot of information in that case with evidence of age discrimination.\u201d\n\nThat includes \u201cvery significant\u201d statistical disparities and \u201ccompelling anecdotal evidence,\u201d Lopez said. The EEOC complaint cites evidence of comments indicating the restaurant chain favored younger people for front-of-the-house positions, Lopez said.\n\nScott remarked he had traveled to different restaurants to examine their front-of-the-house operations. \u201cHaving visited half a dozen, maybe more, restaurants, they all appear the same on the front end,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you look at [Texas Roadhouse's] specific case without information gathered from the application, I would like to hear the anecdotal evidence to have a better understanding of what it takes to get to where you are.\u201d\n\nLopez promised to provide Scott with that information.\n\nSystemic Program a Key Component\n\nCommissioner's charges under Title VII and \u201cdirected investigations\u201d under the Equal Pay Act and Age Discrimination in Employment Act all are \u201ctools\u201d authorized by Congress, Lopez said. The agency's use of those techniques is \u201cno departure\u201d from the EEOC's \u201cordinary practice\u201d during prior administrations, he said.\n\nOnly 12 EEOC lawsuits have been filed based on commissioner's charges or directed investigations since 2010, Lopez said.\n\nThe EEOC has used the commissioner's charge and filed lawsuits alleging systemic discrimination during both Republican and Democratic administrations, said Sen. Christopher S. Murphy (D-Conn.) Although some employers might welcome the EEOC not exercising those powers, the agency's \u201ccontinued reservation\u201d of its authority to do so hasn't changed over the years, Murphy said.\n\nSen. Pat Roberts (R-Kan.) expressed concern the EEOC seems to be looking for \u201cpatterns of discrimination\u201d outside the individual charges filed with the agency when examining the 75,000-plus pending charges might be a better use of agency resources.\n\nYang said agency investigators closed more than 80,000 discrimination charges in fiscal 2014 but that almost 90,000 new charges also were filed. Through its systemic program and strategic enforcement plan, the EEOC is trying to direct its resources where the agency can do the most good, she said.\n\nAbout 25 percent of the EEOC's litigation docket now consists of systemic cases, the highest proportion in the agency's history, Yang said. \u201cWe think that's a good balance of our resources,\u201d she said. Systemic cases refer to those in which the challenged employment policy or practice broadly affects an entire industry, occupation or wide geographic area.\n\nThe EEOC in 1990 had more than 3,000 employees, but the agency's staff since then has been cut by about 1,000 employees even as the U.S. workforce has grown and Congress has given the EEOC added responsibilities, said Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.).\n\nThe investigation and filing of systemic cases \u201cmay be one of the best ways\u201d for the EEOC to use its limited resources, Yang said. Under the systemic program, the EEOC \u201ccarefully identifies\u201d the cases it's going to file and aims at \u201clasting changes\u201d in employer practices that might be causing widespread discrimination, she said.\n\nEEOC and Wellness Programs\n\nThe EEOC April 20 issued its proposed Americans with Disabilities Act regulations addressing employer-sponsored wellness programs and when employers can offer financial incentives or rewards to participants without rendering the programs \u201cinvoluntary\u201d under the ADA. Public comments on the proposal are due June 19.\n\nThe EEOC is aiming by the end of July to produce a proposed rule under the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act to address GINA's effects on wellness programs, Yang told the Senate panel.\n\nThe EEOC's proposed rule under the ADA \u201cdoesn't solve the problem\u201d raised by the EEOC's pursuit of different standards for wellness programs than those contained in the joint regulations issued by the Labor Department, Treasury Department and Department of Health and Human Services under the Affordable Care Act, Alexander said.\n\nAfter the EEOC in 2014 filed two ADA lawsuits against employers with wellness programs that apparently complied with the ACA, Alexander and other congressional Republicans this year introduced legislation intended to shield employers from ADA lawsuits if their wellness programs are consistent with the ACA and its implementing regulations. The Senate HELP Committee also held a Jan. 29 hearing on the benefits of wellness programs.\n\nAt the May 19 hearing, Alexander expressed disappointment the EEOC proposal adopts a limit on permissible employer monetary incentives for wellness plan participants that differs from the incentives allowed under the ACA and its implementing regulations. He asked Yang whether the EEOC would take his proposed legislation into account when finalizing the ADA proposed rule.\n\n\u201cWe are looking forward to feedback from all sources,\u201d Yang replied. She added the EEOC wants to produce a final rule \u201cthat can work for companies\u201d that sponsor wellness programs to improve their employees' health.\n\nThe EEOC issued its proposed rule only after coordination with the Labor Department, Treasury and HHS, the agencies responsible for implementing the ACA and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, Yang said in her prepared testimony.\n\n\u201cWe recognize that many employers wish to implement wellness programs in an effort to improve their employees' health and reduce health care costs,\u201d Yang said in her prepared statement. \u201cWe are also mindful that wellness programs must adhere to the ADA's requirement that disability-related inquiries (such as questions on a health risk assessment) or medical examinations (such as blood tests for cholesterol levels) that are part of employee health programs must be \u2018voluntary.' \u201d\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Kevin McGowan in Washington at kmcgowan@bna.com\n\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Susan J.
