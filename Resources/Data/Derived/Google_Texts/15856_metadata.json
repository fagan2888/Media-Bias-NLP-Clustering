If a person listens to teachers, \"it is because they are also witnesses,\" he said.\n\nMentioning a meeting he had with Pope Francis in June, Vigan\u00f2 said the new pope told him that he \"wants pastoral bishops. Not bishops who profess a particular ideology.\" One of the nuncio's jobs is preparing for the pope the \"terna,\" the list of nominations to fill vacancies in the ranks of bishops.\n\nKnow a recent high school graduate?

The bishops are meeting in Baltimore through Thursday.\n\nIn his address, Dolan only mentioned in passing the bishops' struggle with the Obama administration over a mandate from the Department of Health and Human Services requiring coverage of contraceptive services in health care plans.\n\nShifting to global issues of religious freedom, the cardinal mentioned struggles Christians face in places like Syria, Zanzibar and Egypt.\n\n\"Our good experience defending religious freedom here at home shows that, when we turn our minds to an issue, we can put it on the map,\" Dolan said. \"Now we are being beckoned ... to extend those efforts to the dramatic front lines of this battle, where Christians are paying for their fidelity with their lives.\"\n\nSpeaking at a press conference following the morning session, Dolan said his focus on issues of religious liberty globally was not meant to indicate the U.S. bishops were not united regarding their position on the health care law in the U.S.\n\nThe bishops have \"achieved such unity ... that we've got to go further,\" he said.\n\nWhen he meets bishops from around the world, Dolan said, they frequently thank him for the Americans' focus on religious liberty but ask: \"Could you expand your solicitude to us?\"\n\n\"It's almost like an affirmation of what we've done at home, and it's almost an affirmation that it's time to take it to the next step,\" Dolan said.\n\nVigan\u00f2's references to Francis' style and tone were not the only ones Monday morning.\n\nFrancis was cited and quoted several more times as the bishops moved on to other agenda items, particularly discussions of the Vatican's request for wide input on a planned global meeting of bishops on the family called for next October and how to address poverty in their strategic planning document.\n\nFormer bishops' conference president Archbishop Joseph Fiorenza took to the floor to ask if the conference could \"make it a priority\" to support efforts to eliminate poverty.\n\nFiorenza said such a priority would \"help our conference be on record in trying to achieve what Pope Francis has put before us, to be a church for the poor and a church of the poor.\"\n\nFiorenza, who is the retired archbishop of Galveston-Houston, was responding to a presentation by Seattle Archbishop J. Peter Sartain, chairman of the conference's committee responsible for creating their strategic plan. Sartain gave a short report on the development of that plan and what priorities it included.\n\nSartain replied to Fiorenza that \"all of us have been struck and moved by Pope Francis' call\" and have \"great awareness\" of it.\n\nThe bishops spent about 30 minutes discussing next year's Vatican synod, which is to be held Oct. 5-19, 2014, and is to focus on issues of family life.\n\nAt question was how both the national conference and individual bishops are responding to a questionnaire the Vatican has sent in advance of the synod about how lay Catholics understand the church's teachings on things like same-sex marriage, divorce and contraception.\n\nArchbishop Lorenzo Baldisseri, the secretary of the Synod of Bishops, asked bishops' conferences in an Oct. 18 letter to distribute the questionnaire \"immediately\" and \"as widely as possible.\"\n\nSt. Petersburg, Fla., Bishop Robert Lynch asked if the bishops' national office might create a \"national survey instrument\" to facilitate asking laypeople to respond to the questionnaire.\n\nSeveral prelates -- including Portland, Ore., Archbishop Alexander Sample and Boston Cardinal Sean O'Malley -- took the floor to say they discussed the survey with their diocesan pastoral councils and distributed it to parish pastoral councils for wider discussion.\n\nPhiladelphia Archbishop Charles Chaput said he received several emails from people who \"expect to do this because the Holy Father wants it.\"\n\nSpokane, Wash., Bishop Blase Cupich said he wanted to encourage the bishops to consult women religious when working on the questionnaire as they are \"so often a part of people's married and family lives.\"\n\nAfter the end of the allotted 30 minutes, the bishops moved on to their next agenda item, but with the understanding they would discuss the synod and questionnaire in executive session Wednesday.\n\nAfter a motion on the floor from retired Washington Cardinal Theodore McCarrick, the bishops also voted Monday to endorse a recent letter from Dolan calling on the U.S. Congress to pass comprehensive immigration reform.\n\n[Joshua J.
