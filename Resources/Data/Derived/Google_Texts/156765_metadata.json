It\u2019s not a hard and fast deadline,\u201d Mr. McCarthy, California Republican, said. \u201cI don\u2019t think there is a reason we have to hurry. So you\u2019ll see something later.\u201d\n\nReconciliation is a complex budget tool that allows Congress to forge new legislation while avoiding a filibuster in the Senate. Democrats used the tool to help pass Obamacare in 2010, although President Obama would still maintain a veto over whatever Congress passes this time around.\n\nThe GOP is unlikely to garner the votes to surmount that hurdle, so some Republicans and fiscal watchdogs wonder if it makes sense to use reconciliation on Obamacare at all.\n\nYet many conservatives said they voted for the fiscal 2016 budget with the explicit understanding that reconciliation would be used to attack Obamacare, so they\u2019ve warned leadership not to water down their plans.\n\nSpeaker John A. Boehner, Mr. McCarthy and others insist that repealing the health care law remains their focus, but they had to retool their strategy after the Supreme Court last month upheld the Affordable Care Act\u2019s payment of subsidies to customers in all states.\n\nRepublicans had been banking on the court striking down the subsidies in most states, creating a crisis within the program that would give them leverage to attack the law.\n\nMr. McCarthy said people should expect a plan, although it could be months later.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s something we need to do and we will,\u201d he added, but not by July 24.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy said Tuesday Republicans will blow past a deadline this week to report ways they could leverage a fast-track budget tool to send an Obamacare repeal bill to the White House.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy said Tuesday Republicans will blow past a deadline this week to report ways they could leverage a fast-track budget tool to send an Obamacare repeal bill to the White House.", "title": "House GOP blow off flimsy deadline for fast-track Obamacare repeal", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jul/21/house-gop-blow-off-deadline-obamacare-repeal/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/04/28/4_282015_ap872225495258201.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/04/28/4_282015_ap872225495258201.jpg", "description": "House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy said Tuesday Republicans will blow past a deadline this week to report ways they could leverage a fast-track budget tool to send an Obamacare repeal bill to the Wh", "card": "summary", "title": "House GOP blow off flimsy deadline for fast-track Obamacare repeal"}, "Author": "Tom Howell Jr.", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Politics, Kevin Mccarthy, Republican Party"}, "article_summary": "House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy said Tuesday Republicans will blow past a deadline this week to report ways they could leverage a fast-track budget tool to send an Obamacare repeal bill to the White House.\nSo you\u2019ll see something later.\u201dReconciliation is a complex budget tool that allows Congress to forge new legislation while avoiding a filibuster in the Senate.\nBut the instructions remain in place until they\u2019re supplanted by a new budget, so the deadline is virtually meaningless.\nDemocrats used the tool to help pass Obamacare in 2010, although President Obama would still maintain a veto over whatever Congress passes this time around.\nIt\u2019s not a hard and fast deadline,\u201d Mr. McCarthy, California Republican, said."}
