(Photo: Dan Radel/Staff Photo)Buy Photo\n\n\u2014 The West End lawsuit had been assigned to Superior Court Judge Thomas F. Scully, according to the Monmouth County Courthouse.\n\nNews tips received by the Asbury Park Press late Friday afternoon that it has been switched back to Superior Court Judge Lisa Thornton could not be confirmed.\n\nThe lawsuit, filed in June by West End-based attorney Scott M. Kelly on his own behalf, is challenging the legality of the new West End Overlay District. Kelly wants the zoning overturned.\n\nThe lawsuit names the city, the mayor and council as defendants.\n\nThe West End is a mix of small businesses \u2014 pizza and ice cream shops, jewelry stores and bars \u2014 and residences one block from the beach. The city rezoned the West End district in April to include new conditional uses, such as religious, performing arts and multi-family dwelling units that weren't permitted before.\n\nKelly alleges the city used spot zoning \u2014 the use of the zoning power to benefit particular interests rather than the collective interests of the community \u2014 when it created the West End Overlay Design. He is asking the court to grant an injunction that would temporarily prohibit the city from approving any applications in the new zone until a final ruling is made on his challenge.\n\nIt has not been assigned a court date yet.\n\nThe city has filed a motion to dismiss the case, alleging Kelly's complaint is frivolous, and potentially libelous.\n\nDon't miss a thing Download our apps and get alerts for local news, weather, traffic and more.
