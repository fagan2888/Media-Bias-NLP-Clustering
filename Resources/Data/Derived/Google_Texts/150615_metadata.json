The footage had been resurfaced by CBS News in 2008 due to Hillary Clinton\u2019s claims during her presidential election campaign that on her trip to Bosnia she had landed \u201cunder sniper fire\u201d to no welcome ceremony and was told to \u201crun to the cars.\u201d\n\nThe report, which is by CBS News\u2019 Sharyl Attkisson, shows footage of Hillary Clinton\u2019s trip to Bosnia accompanied by CBS News when she was First Lady in March 1996. The clip cuts from the footage of Hillary Clinton in Bosnia to a speech she made in 2008 during the election campaign, when she talks about how she and her party were supposed to have been welcomed by a greeting ceremony at the airport but instead they just \u201cran with their heads down to get to their base.\u201d\n\nAttkisson talks of Clinton\u2019s remarks being untrue and how CBS News should know as they were with the former First Lady on her trip to Bosnia. The clip shows pictures CBS News recorded of Hillary Clinton greeting children at the welcoming ceremony when the plane landed, the ceremony Clinton later claimed \u201cdidn\u2019t happen.\u201d\n\nThe footage also clearly shows there was no sniper fire back at the base and Clinton posing for photographs with army troops and later singing at a USO show alongside Cheryl Crowe, a far cry from the assertions of \u201crunning for cover\u201d Clinton claimed some 12 years later.\n\nNumerous Contradictions\n\nThe report then shows Clinton\u2019s campaign aide, Lissa Muscatine, defending Clinton\u2019s comments about her dramatic arrival in Bosnia, stating that she meant there had been fire in the hillside when they landed. The clip also shows Mike Allen of Politico.com talking of how the \u201cdramaticized\u201d claims will give Barack Obama a case to prove that all the experience Hillary Clinton has is at least partly her imagination.\n\nIn the wake of the report that shows Clinton\u2019s contradictions, the Washington Post wrote how there were \u201cnumerous problems with Clinton\u2019s version of events\u201d (2).\n\n\u201cHillary Clinton has been regaling supporters on the campaign trail with her hair-raising tales of a trip she made to Bosnia in March 1996,\u201d wrote the Washington Post.\n\nThe report went on that had Clinton\u2019s plane landed \u201cunder sniper fire\u201d, we would \u201ccertainly have heard about it long before now.\u201d\n\nOf course this is not the only time Hillary Clinton has been involved in a scandal involving the democratic candidate possibly telling lies.\n\nIn January this year, the Huffington Post was quick to pick up on the inaccuracies about Clinton\u2019s attacks on Bernie Sanders (3). In a recent speech in New Hampshire Clinton spoke of Sen. Sanders wanting to \u201cdismantle Obamacare, dismantle the CHIP program, dismantle Medicare, and dismantle private insurance.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "cbs clinton scandal, clinton bosnia scandal, hillary greeting bosnia, clinton dishonesty, hillary clinton, conspiracy, top secret, offbeat", "generator": "Powered by Visual Composer - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.", "og": {"site_name": "Top Secret Writers", "description": "In 2008, CBS News (1) resurfaced its 12-year-old report showing Hillary Clinton as the First Lady arriving in Bosnia with her daughter in 1996.
