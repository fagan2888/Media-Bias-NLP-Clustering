He shouldn\u2019t need what follows, but obviously does. No other conclusion is possible after his interview with Politico a few days ago. The subject was Barack Obama and what the Republican presidential contender sees as the inferior quality of the president\u2019s blackness. \u201cHe\u2019s an \u2018African\u2019 American,\u201d said Carson. \u201cHe was, you know, raised white. I mean, like most Americans, I was proud that we broke the color barrier when he was elected, but . . . he didn\u2019t grow up like I grew up . . . \u201d\n\nCarson doesn\u2019t fail to mention that Obama spent some of his youth in Indonesia. I\u2019m guessing the word \u201cmadrasa\u201d came up.\n\nLet\u2019s not even get into the fact that the man questioning Obama\u2019s racial bona fides once stood before an audience of white conservatives and proclaimed the Affordable Care Act \u201cthe worst thing that has happened in this country since slavery.\u201d Let\u2019s deal instead with Carson\u2019s implicit assertion that to be authentically black requires being fatherless and broke, scrabbling for subsistence in the \u2019hood.\n\nIt\u2019s not just a conversation I wish I could hear Pitts and Carson have face to face, it\u2019s one that Americans of all races would benefit from hearing.\n\nElizabeth Williamson is either the quickest writer on the planet, or she sneakily had her Clinton Triumphant column written in advance. Hey, maybe she had a Bernie one, too. Just in case.\n\nThe Clintons worked hard to overcome a long and sometimes bitter history in the Palmetto State. After Mr. Obama trounced Mrs. Clinton in South Carolina in 2008, Bill Clinton, angry at her big defeat by a young idealist, compared Mr. Obama\u2019s win to the Rev. Jesse L. Jackson\u2019s victories in the 1984 and 1988 South Carolina primaries. Many Democrats were enraged by those comments, finding them sour and dismissive of black voters in general. Mrs. Clinton\u2019s win on Saturday suggests that she could dominate other Southern states with large proportions of black voters, such as Alabama, Georgia and Tennessee, on Super Tuesday, March 1. Mr. Sanders seems to have all but given up on these states, and is not advertising in them. Instead he hopes to increase his delegate count in states like Minnesota, Massachusetts and Texas on Tuesday.\n\nAnd\u2026 yeah. Not the deepest analysis of the election, and there\u2019s not a lot of fresh insight to collect, but it was out fast.\n\nThe New York Times says the relationship between the GOP and gun manufacturers is as tight as ever.\n\nRealistically, no one studying politics should have expected the remaining Republican presidential contenders to speak up at their latest debate about the nation\u2019s harrowing problem of mass shootings. For all their rambling conflict last Thursday, they did not say a word about the carnage, even if six more innocent citizens were shot dead just days before in Kalamazoo, Mich. Three other people were murdered by a gunman in Hesston, Kan., on the very night of the debate. But it\u2019s been clear for months that facing up to the gun mayhem is a nonstarter for the Republican contenders except, perhaps, if one of the shooters turns out to have Islamic connections. That would very likely spark another bout of dire campaign warnings about the threat of international terrorism, as distinct from the domestic kind that is perpetrated so regularly it slips off the Republican radar. (How many dead this time? Too few for the usual \u201cthoughts and prayers\u201d bromides from the candidates.)\n\nAnd sadly, we\u2019re not surprised. Just sad. Apparently there is no level of violence conducted by Billy Bob and company that moves the public needle.\n\nFrank Bruni wins the Freaky Sunday Award for strange column titles with \u201cIf Donald Trump changed genders.\u201d\n\nImagine, for a moment, the presidential candidacy of a rich, brash real estate magnate and reality TV star named Donna Trump. Quizzically coifed and stubbornly sun-kissed, she\u2019s on her third marriage. There\u2019s clear evidence that infidelity factored into the demise of the first, and among her children is one conceived when The Donna wasn\u2019t married to the other parent. Her sexual appetites have been prodigious, at least according to her frequent claims and vulgar cant. And she has a tendency \u2014 disturbing on its own, even more so in someone who aspires to civic leadership \u2014 to talk about men as sirloins and rump roasts of disparate succulence. She denigrates those who displease her on cosmetic grounds: How well do you think The Donna would do in the polls? How far into the race would she survive?\n\nHmm. Longer than Carly Fiorino, and roughly as long as every television show starring Sarah Palin?\n\nThe New York Times reminds us of the elevated importance of this election.\n\nThe decades-long crusade to end legal abortion in America after Roe v. Wade has again reached the Supreme Court. On Wednesday, the eight justices will hear a case challenging a 2013 Texas law that has already shut down more than half of the state\u2019s 41 health clinics that perform abortions. ... Texas\u2019 law, like similar ones around the country, was written by anti-abortion activists with the sole purpose of shutting down clinics. Its two main requirements have nothing to do with protecting women\u2019s health. ... The outcome of the Texas case is now less clear with the death of Justice Antonin Scalia, who wanted to overturn Roe v. Wade and was a solid vote in favor of all restrictions on abortion. If the justices split 4 to 4 in the Texas case, it would leave the Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision in place, meaning that the Texas and Louisiana laws would remain in effect and women in both states would suffer the consequences.\n\nWhy even assume that these guys are passing umpteen variations on anti-abortion laws just for the effect of the individual bits of legislation? It\u2019s likely that a major reason for the stream is the hope that the court will eventually provide a ruling so muddle-headedly open (i.e. Citizens United) that it can be used to justify flat out anything.\n\nRoss Douthat explains\u2026 hang on. First, brace yourself. Ready? Okay, Ross Douthat now explains why Obama is to blame for Trump.\n\nThe spectacle of the Republican Party\u2019s Trumpian meltdown has inspired a mix of glee and fear among liberals \u2014 glee over their rivals\u2019 self-immolation, and fear that what arises from the destruction will be worse. What it hasn\u2019t inspired is much in the way of self-examination, or a recognition of the way that Obama-era trends in liberal politics have helped feed the Trump phenomenon.\n\nYou know why there hasn\u2019t been much self-examination of how \u201cObama-era trends in liberal politics\u201d fed the Trump monster? Because it\u2019s a painfully stupid idea. That\u2019s why. But please, break new ground. Tell us how we did it.\n\n...Trumpism is also a creature of the late Obama era, irrupting after eight years when a charismatic liberal president has dominated the cultural landscape and set the agenda for national debates. President Obama didn\u2019t give us Trump in any kind of Machiavellian or deliberate fashion. But it isn\u2019t an accident that this is the way the Obama era ends \u2014 with a reality TV demagogue leading a populist, nationalist revolt.\n\nWait. You\u2019re saying that\u2026 no. Hang on. Obama is so\u2026 I mean, reality shows\u2026\n\nWe\u2019ve reached a new milestone. I can\u2019t even figure out what Douthat is trying to say. Is it that after Obama has mind-controlled the nation for eight years, we have nothing between our ears capable of resisting The Tan One? Or is it just Douthat\u2019s all purpose excuse: liberalism makes bad things happen? I want it noted that Douthat has achieved this intellectual mire without resorting to a single word of Old Icelandic or using even a snippet of marginalia from the Geneva Bible. That\u2019s bonus points.\n\nKathleen Parker is convinced Hillary is Black Trump.\n\nIf Donald Trump speaks for disenfranchised whites, Hillary Clinton speaks mostly to blacks who feel the same.\n\nLast week Bernie was the Donald Trump of the left. This week Hillary is the Donald Trump of the left. Because, dammit, Democrats should share the pain!\n\nBut the differences in how people, left and right, perceive the world\u2019s injustices \u2014 and the various approaches today\u2019s presidential front-runners are bringing to Super Tuesday \u2014 suggest that we dwell in worlds apart. Black and white, as ever before.\n\nOh, I see. Parker wants to make this easy. Trump speaks for the white people! Hillary speaks for the black people! The Lorax speaks for the trees! And we\u2019re all angry (probably due to a shortages of thneeds). There\u2019s more to this column, but it\u2019s more of this plodding, pedantic effort to make this all simpler than it is.\n\nR. R. Reno visits with evangelical Christians for Trump.\n\nDonald Trump won the white evangelical Christian vote in the South Carolina primary and the Nevada caucuses. This support has been evident for months, causing evangelical leaders to wring their hands. Last year, Russell Moore, president of the Southern Baptist Convention\u2019s influential Washington organization, the Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission, wrote a New York Times op-ed headlined: \u201cHave Evangelicals Who Support Trump Lost Their Values?\u201d Maybe, but the reason so many evangelicals are for Trump is fairly simple to explain. Religious conservatives have been losing a lot lately. This has put them in a rebellious mood.\n\nEvangelical Christians have not been \u201closing a lot lately.\u201d Evangelical Christians have been told that they\u2019re losing a lot, what with the war on everything and one slim vote in the Supreme Court being all that holds the coliseums and lions at bay. People have been throwing an extra batch of hellfire and damnation their way, and look at that, they\u2019re actually scared. Which is how evangelical leaders like their flock. They just don\u2019t like them flocking to Trump.\n\nErik Wemple on a new promise from Trump.\n\n...Trump did appear to be veering into a new talking point. A media-law talking point, that is: One of the things I\u2019m going to do, and this is going to make it tougher for me\u2026but one of the things I\u2019m going to do if I win\u2026is I\u2019m going to open up our libel laws so when they write purposely negative and horrible and false articles, we can sue them and win lots of money. We\u2019re going to open up those libel laws. So that when the New York Times writes a hit piece, which is a total disgrace, or when the Washington Post, which is there for other reasons, writes a hit piece, we can sue them and win money instead of having no chance of winning because they\u2019re totally protected. An attack on media law is a logical extension of Trump\u2019s rhetoric, not to mention a threat to American democracy.\n\nLet\u2019s see: deportation? Check. Wall? Check. Torture? Double-check. Ending pesky first amendment protections and making it illegal to criticize the glorious leader? Big fat check. Yes, we\u2019re still on track for fascism, and don\u2019t forget it.\n\nDana Milbank and the middle grade metaphor.\n\nHave you completed the third grade? If so, this may be why you are having trouble understanding the appeal of Donald Trump. At Thursday night\u2019s Republican presidential debate, Ben Carson delivered an opening statement about \u201cthe abyss of destruction.\u201d An analysis shows he was communicating at the level of a 10th-grader\u2019s comprehension. Marco Rubio, who spoke of \u201cthe identity of America in the 21st century,\u201d was also at the high school level. Ted Cruz and John Kasich were at middle school comprehension levels. And then there was Trump \u2014 at a third-grade level:\n\nTrump\u2019s no dummy, dummy. He just assumes everyone else is.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Daily Kos", "description": "If you\u2019ve never gone over to\u00a0 Compound Interest \u00a0to look at one of the chemical infographics I borrow from them so often on Sunday mornings, go give this one a try.
