State leaders, responding to a groundswell of protests, added a co-pay system, and delivered more insurance choices for members for 2015.\n\nA Facebook group created to protest the State Health Benefit Plan changes, Teachers Rally to Advocate for Georgia Insurance Choices, or TRAGIC, applauded the increased choices of health plans when they were announced. But at that time, the group also maintained there was a lack of affordability, citing high deductibles and other employee costs.\n\nTRAGIC reacted swiftly to the new study\u2019s findings.\n\n\u201cThe Aon report confirms what the members of TRAGIC have been saying all along: The insurance offered under the [State Health Benefits Plan] is unaffordable for Georgia\u2019s teachers and state employees,\u2019\u2019 John Palmer, a TRAGIC leader, said in a statement.\n\nThe consulting firm study was commissioned by the Georgia General Assembly earlier this year to ascertain \u201cwhy [State Health Benefit Plan] costs are higher than other comparable government employee health plans.\u201d The study looked at costs for active employees and pre-Medicare retirees.\n\nThe Aon Hewitt report also found that in terms of controlling costs, Georgia\u2019s plan was third lowest, on an adjusted basis, among the seven health plans studied. Financial management of the health plan \u201cis at least on par\u201d with other plans, the study added.\n\nBut it found that the overall benefits plan design is \u201crelatively lean,\u2019\u2019 producing higher employee cost-sharing, or premiums plus out-of-pocket costs, as compared to similar plans in Florida, Kentucky, Mississippi, South Carolina and Tennessee and also with Georgia\u2019s Board of Regents Plan.\n\n\u201cThe report placed the high cost for insurance on the [State Health Benefits Plan] plan designs,\u2019\u2019 Palmer said, adding, \u201cThe Affordable Care Act was not cited as a factor.\u201d\n\nTRAGIC has noted that in some years when state revenues are low, Georgia budget writers have raided the financial reserves of the plan to balance the overall budget.\n\nThe report discussed several potential tactics to lower costs, including use of telemedicine, on-site health clinics, and narrowing choices of medical providers.\n\nPalmer said, \u201cThe one suggestion that might actually reduce employee costs without reducing benefits would be for the state of Georgia to increase its contribution per employee.\u201d\n\nIn another important finding, the consulting firm said that for non-certificate school personnel, such as bus drivers and cafeteria workers, the plan has a shortage of about $40 per member per month. That gap occurs despite the fact that the state has increased the contribution from school districts.\n\nGov. Nathan Deal\u2019s original budget for fiscal 2016 called for elimination of the benefits for 11,500 part-time school employees who work fewer than 30 hours a week.\n\nThe Georgia legislature, feeling the heat over the unpopular proposal, put the benefits for the non-certificate workers back into the budget. But the legislators shifted that cost \u2014 more than $100 million \u2014 to the local school districts.\n\nThe Aon Hewitt report said that to close the financial gap, the state could charge these school workers a higher premium or reduce their benefits.\n\nPalmer, however, said, \u201cAsking these essential personnel to pay even more is not a viable option.\u201d\n\nThe only suggestion with any chance of bringing member costs in line with those of other states while maintaining benefits would be for the General Assembly to budget more money for the plan, he said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "ATLANTA | Since January 2014, many Georgia schoolteachers and state employees have complained about their health insurance plan, saying they bear a heavier burden in costs.
