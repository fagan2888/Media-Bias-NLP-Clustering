Employees who previously had 100 percent premium coverage will pay more than they did in 2015. For example, Otterbein said his sous chef is now shelling out $1,100 a month for family coverage.\n\nBut now that A Restaurant must pay for roughly 30 employees who are opting for insurance, it will pay only 70 percent of the premium and cover employees only.\n\nBefore the ACA mandate, A Restaurant paid 100 percent of healthcare premiums for about eight upper-management employees as a perk, co-owner Jordan Otterbein said. That included coverage for spouses and dependents.\n\nStarting in 2016, the Affordable Care Act requires employers with 50 to 99 full-time-equivalent employees to offer health coverage to their full-timers. Employers with 100 or more full-timers have been required to offer health insurance since early 2015.\n\nMarin is a modern American diner that will offer breakfast all day. When diners get the bill, it will indicate hospitality is included. At The Guild, the bill will be discreet. Members of the Club 33-style restaurant will be billed through a tab-style system that sends your itemized check via email thus eliminating the \"end of the meal\" check altogether.\n\nRestaurant Marin and The Guild Club, new dining concepts by Chef Noah Blom and his wife Marin Howarth, are opening in December at South Coast Collection in Costa Mesa. The couple also owns the award-winning restaurant, Arc, at SoCo.\n\nThe owners of two high-profile Orange County restaurants are taking a stand on rising labor costs by implementing controversial changes that could lead to sticker shock on your next dining bill.\n\nIn Newport Beach, A Restaurant is tacking on a 2 percent surcharge to cover soon-to-be-required employee health benefits totaling an estimated $72,000 a year. The surcharge is effective Tuesday. Six miles away at hipster enclave South Coast Collection in Costa Mesa, Chef Noah Blom is taking a different approach: he\u2019s scrapping tips and bumping menu prices by as much as 25 percent at two new restaurants.\n\n\u201c\u2019Hospitality included\u2019 is how we like to call it,\u201d Blom said. \u201cThere are some people that won\u2019t understand, and the menu prices will shock them.\u201d\n\nThe three restaurants appear to be the first in Orange County to openly link price increases to government-mandated healthcare premiums and wage hikes.\n\nOn Jan. 1, California\u2019s minimum wage increases $1 to $10 an hour. On the same day, the Affordable Care Act kicks in for businesses that employ 50 to 99 full-time workers \u2013 impacting dozens of independent restaurants.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hitting all sorts of small businesses between the eyes,\u201d said Jordan Otterbein, co-owner of A Restaurant, of the ACA mandate.\n\nRuss Bendel, vice president of the California Restaurant Association\u2019s Orange County chapter, said other local restaurateurs have discussed surcharges, but none have made the jump until now.\n\n\u201cWith all the new regulations, especially wages, I think you\u2019ll start seeing more people follow suit,\u201d said Bendel, owner of The Vine, a wine country bistro in San Clemente.\n\nMatt Sutton, vice president of government affairs and public policy at the CRA, said the ACA has had a huge impact on the hospitality industry. \u201cA law like this is the biggest policy change that restaurants have had to comply with \u2013 possibly ever,\u201d he said.\n\nSurcharges, Sutton said, have become an \u201cemerging trend\u201d in California as clusters of restaurants in the Bay Area and Los Angeles have adopted such policies as a matter of survival.\n\n\u201cWe are seeing it pick up now,\u201d Sutton said. \u201cYou do have this layering (effect) of additional costs that\u2019s making (restaurants) alter business models.\u201d\n\nA Restaurant: Cut jobs or add surcharge?\n\nWhen A Restaurant\u2019s Otterbein began crunching the numbers for 2016, the outlook didn\u2019t look good.\n\nOf the restaurant\u2019s 59 eligible full-time employees, roughly 30 so far have opted to take advantage of health insurance, Otterbein said. That\u2019s four times more than during the restaurant\u2019s last open enrollment period.\n\nOtterbein, whose business partner is Hollywood filmmaker McG, said the added cost to cover those 30 employees amounts to roughly $6,000 a month. To maintain profits at his fine dining establishment on the Pacific Coast Highway, he looked at other options. They included cutting 10 jobs or risking a $36,000 fine by not offering insurance to anyone.\n\n\u201cI discussed every possible option,\u201d he said. \u201cWithout exception, everyone thought (the surcharge) was the right thing to do and a good idea.\u201d\n\nAmy Evans, president of Colibri Insurance Services in Sherman Oaks, said it is challenging for businesses offering insurance for the first time to predict their costs.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a tough spot for a business owner to be in, especially in an industry with such low profit margins,\u201d said Evans, a health insurance broker who helps California employers navigate ACA.\n\nA Restaurant\u2019s surcharge comes a year after several popular Los Angeles restaurants implemented a 3 percent surcharge.\n\nPredictably, the fee didn\u2019t go over well with some diners.\n\nIn September, a class-action lawsuit was filed against a handful of top Los Angeles restaurants, including Suzanne Goin\u2019s Tavern. The suit alleges the dining establishments are price fixing.\n\n\u201cThe issue here is you can\u2019t do this together and influence the market,\u201d said attorney Daniel R. Sterrett, whose Los Angeles firm filed the suit.\n\nSterrett said he has no problem with restaurateurs acting on their own to add surcharges, like A Restaurant is doing.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with a surcharge on the menu if you\u2019re above board and not deceptive about it,\u201d he said.\n\nOtterbein said the surcharge will be transparent \u2013 posted on menus and checks as a charge added to \u201ccover employee benefits.\u201d For a party of four at dinner, the likely surcharge would total $6, or $1.50 per person.\n\nHe hopes loyal customers will embrace the fee because they know it directly benefits workers. Still, complaints are inevitable, he said.\n\n\u201cIf someone doesn\u2019t want to pay it, we\u2019ll smile and gladly take it off,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not going to argue with a customer.\u201d\n\nSutton, of the state\u2019s restaurant association, said surcharges are more palatable to diners than menu price hikes.\n\n\u201cWhen you build it into the price (of food), they get sticker shock, and they don\u2019t understand why it\u2019s there,\u201d he said.\n\nHospitality included: risk or relief?\n\nSteeper menu prices are a risk Chef Noah Blom is willing to take.\n\nHis no-gratuity policy will apply to his new restaurants, The Guild Club and Restaurant Marin, both slated to open later this month at South Coast Collection in Costa Mesa.\n\nAt his critically acclaimed Arc, where each dish is cooked over an open fire, tipping will remain, Blom said.\n\nHe and his wife, Marin Howarth, said they hope that including the cost of hospitality in the overall food prices will be a relief to diners.\n\n\u201cTips makes people uncomfortable,\u201d said Howarth, managing partner of the couple\u2019s DirtySexyHappiness Hospitality Group.\n\nWith \u201chospitality included\u201d in menu prices that are on average 25 percent higher than normal, Blom said he can level the playing field among his staff. All minimum wage staffers, from dishwashers to servers, will get paid $15 an hour starting Jan. 1.\n\nBlom offered the Register an exclusive first look at Marin\u2019s menu prices.\n\nThe modern diner, named after his wife, features a seafood-centric all-day breakfast menu. A homemade yogurt dish with berries and toasted brown sugar oats is listed at $14, while a gourmet \u201cEgg McMuffin\u201d style dish will be priced at $20. The latter, Blom notes, is a large dish \u2013 a fried egg topped with shaved bacon, spinach and aged cheddar on a 6-inch English muffin made from scratch.\n\nBlom said the egg dish might have cost $15 or $16 under the old tipping structure.\n\nBlom\u2019s hospitality-included policy comes a month after famed restaurateur Danny Meyer announced plans to eliminate tipping at his New York City restaurants. The policy is being phased in this month.\n\nMeyer operates Union Square Hospitality Group, whose restaurants include, The Modern, Union Square Cafe, Gramercy Tavern and Blue Smoke.\n\nLike Blom, Meyer is also raising wages. By paying $5 more an hour than the mandated state minimum wage, Blom and his wife hope to attract staff who want to make the hospitality business a career.\n\n\u201cThere will be blowback and we\u2019ll lose some servers, but we think it\u2019s right,\u201d Blom said.", "article_metadata": {"geo.placename": "Santa Ana", "geo.region": "US-CA", "content_section": "business", "description": "Business: Menu surcharges, price hikes land at 3 O.C. restaurants | blom, restaurants, restaurant, menu, surcharge, hospitality, prices, insurance, price, surcharges", "geo.position": "33.745573;-117.867834", "author": "NANCY LUNA", "og": {"site_name": "The Orange County Register", "description": "The owners of two high-profile Orange County restaurants are taking a stand on rising labor costs by implementing controversial changes that could lead to sticker shock on your next dining bill.", "title": "Obamacare costs prompt menu surcharges, price hikes and no tipping policy at 3 O.C. restaurants", "url": "http://www.ocregister.com/articles/blom-694315-restaurants-restaurant.html", "image": "http://images.onset.freedom.com/ocregister/gallery/nyntun-b88576110z.120151130193025000gvjdf3h7.10.jpg", "locale": "en-US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@ocregister", "image": {"src": "http://images.onset.freedom.com/ocregister/gallery/nyntun-b88576110z.120151130193025000gvjdf3h7.10.jpg"}, "description": "The owners of two high-profile Orange County restaurants are taking a stand on rising labor costs by implementing controversial changes that could lead to sticker shock on your next dining bill.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Obamacare costs prompt menu surcharges, price hikes and no tipping policy at 3 O.C. restaurants"}, "content_author": "NANCY LUNA", "fb": {"app_id": 107698536003308}, "content_thumbnail": "http://images.onset.freedom.com/ocregister/thumb/nyntun-b88576110z.120151130193025000gvjdf3h7.10.jpg", "content_type": "article", "ICBM": "33.745573, -117.867834", "Keywords": "blom, restaurants, restaurant, menu, surcharge, hospitality, prices, insurance, price, surcharges", "publication_date": "2015-11-30", "access-type": "paid", "section": "business", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "content_title": "Obamacare costs prompt menu surcharges, price hikes and no tipping policy at 3 O.C. restaurants"}, "article_summary": "A Restaurant\u2019s surcharge comes a year after several popular Los Angeles restaurants implemented a 3 percent surcharge.\nWith \u201chospitality included\u201d in menu prices that are on average 25 percent higher than normal, Blom said he can level the playing field among his staff.\nSteeper menu prices are a risk Chef Noah Blom is willing to take.\nBlom offered the Register an exclusive first look at Marin\u2019s menu prices.\nHospitality included: risk or relief?"}
