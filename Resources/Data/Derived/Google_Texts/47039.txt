At least two separate former Obama administration officials seemed to hint on Twitter that Democrats should consider denying New York Senator Chuck Schumer a leadership position after he broke with President Barack Obama on the Iran deal.

Ever since current Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid announced he would not seek reelection, Schumer has been seen as the heir apparent to head Senate Democrats. Back in March, potential rival Dick Durbin officially endorsed Schumer’s bid to take over the position.

But former Director of Speechwriting Jon Favreau threw some shade Schumer’s way, asking “This is our next Senate leader?” He then tweeted out a Huffington Post story on Durbin’s support of the Iran deal, writing “This is a Democratic leader.”

Likewise, former Senior Adviser to President Obama Dan Pfeiffer endorsed an attack on Schumer from Moveon.org, and questioned Schumer’s ability to lead the Democrats.

Senator Schumer siding with the GOP against Obama, Clinton, and most Democrats will make it hard for him to lead the Dems in '16 — Dan Pfeiffer (@danpfeiffer) August 7, 2015

The base won't support a leader who thought Obamacare was a mistake and wants War with Iran https://t.co/w812OOGd8x — Dan Pfeiffer (@danpfeiffer) August 7, 2015
