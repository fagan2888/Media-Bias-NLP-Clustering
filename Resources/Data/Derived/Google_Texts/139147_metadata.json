From May 6 to July 16, the deadline for final security plans fell through three times, while security assessments \u2014 which were supposed to be finished June 7 \u2013were pushed back to Aug. 16 and then Aug. 23.\n\n\u201cNothing can undermine public confidence more than the fear of a security and privacy breach,\u201d Georgetown Law professor Lawrence Gostin said. \u201cYou could have somebody hack into the system, get your Social Security number, get your financial information.\u201d\n\nDespite Medicare chief Marilyn Tavenner accepting the risk and \u201cmitigation\u201d measures, three officials said in a statement that \u201cdoes not reduce the risk\u201d of an Oct. 1 launch, CBS News reports.\n\nThe Obama administration insists nobody will lose coverage as a result of cancellation notices going out to millions of people. At least 3.5 million Americans have been issued cancellations, but the exact number is unclear. Associated Press checks find that data is unavailable in a half the states.\n\nDuring a speech before Organizing for Action Monday night, Obama described what he meant when he previously said that no one would lose their coverage under the new law.\n\n\u201cNow, if you have or had one of these plans before the Affordable Care Act came into law and you really like that plan, what we said was you could keep it if it hasn\u2019t changed since the law was passed. So we wrote into the Affordable Care Act you\u2019re grandfathered in on that plan,\u201d Obama said. \u201cBut if the insurance company changes it, then what we\u2019re saying is they\u2019ve got to change it to a higher standard. They\u2019ve got to make it better. They\u2019ve got to improve the quality of the plan that they\u2019re selling. That\u2019s part of the promise that we made, too.\u201d\n\nThe administration refuses to release enrollment numbers until mid-November, when a crash program of computer fixes may be showing results. The numbers are expected to be disappointingly low.\n\n(TM and \u00a9 Copyright 2013 CBS Radio Inc. and its relevant subsidiaries. CBS RADIO and EYE Logo TM and Copyright 2013 CBS Broadcasting Inc.
