(AP) - With state budget negotiations likely stalled until the fall, so too is Gov. Maggie Hassan\u2019s timeline for announcing whether she\u2019ll challenge U.S. Sen. Kelly Ayotte next year.\n\nAnd with Hassan the first domino in a line of Democrats who may aspire to higher office, others are left in a holding pattern until she makes her intentions known.\n\n\u201cThe logjam that\u2019s holding things up from shifting and moving around is Gov. Hassan,\u201d said Andy Smith, director of the University of New Hampshire Survey Center.\n\nWith the election 16 months away, there\u2019s no rush for Hassan to decide. She is considered far and away the best potential challenger for Ayotte and early polling shows a matchup between the two would be tight.\n\nMost political observers had been expecting a decision from Hassan sometime this summer after state budget negotiations wrapped up. But now that she\u2019s vetoed the spending plan, she and her team say crafting a new state budget remains her top priority.\n\n\u201cPeople from across New Hampshire and the country continue to encourage the Governor to consider all options for continuing her service on behalf of Granite Staters, and she has told them that she is focused on reaching a responsible budget compromise and that she has no timetable for any decisions related to 2016,\u201d Marc Goldberg, Hassan\u2019s former campaign manager and a senior adviser to her political committee, said in an email.\n\nMany Democrats say they truly believe Hassan hasn\u2019t made up her mind. As a relatively popular, second-term governor with statewide name recognition, Smith said Hassan could hold off until late fall or even early next year before deciding. She could still easily mobilize supporters and quickly raise the cash necessary to compete.\n\nThe New Hampshire race could be a key to control of the Senate and national Democrats are encouraging Hassan to run.\n\nBut Hassan\u2019s delay sends ripples throughout her party. As she waits to make up her mind, other potential Democratic candidates for governor and senator are frozen in place.\n\nThere are plenty of other names in the mix, including executive councilors Chris Pappas and Colin Van Ostern, U.S. Rep. Annie Kuster and former congresswoman Carol Shea-Porter. Businessman Mark Connolly, a former head of the state\u2019s Bureau of Securities Regulation, is planning to run for governor if Hassan does not seek re-election.\n\nAyotte, elected to the Senate in 2010 in her first run for any office, officially launched her re-election bid last week. As one of a few female GOP senators, Ayotte rose quickly to national prominence and is often a leading Republican voice on national security and other issues. She has often been mentioned as a potential vice presidential candidate. Ayotte\u2019s spokeswoman declined to comment on the 2016 campaign.\n\n\u201cSen. Ayotte remains focused on her job to best serve the people of New Hampshire in the U.S. Senate,\u201d spokeswoman Liz Johnson said.\n\nMeanwhile, the state Republican and Democratic parties are already working to bloody Hassan and Ayotte in anticipation of a matchup.\n\nRepublicans claim Hassan vetoed the budget for purely political reasons as a way to shore up her base for a Senate run. Democrats, meanwhile, say Ayotte is pulling the strings behind Republican decisions in the Legislature in hopes of weakening Hassan. Both state parties are trying to gin up bad press for the other side, but neither has produced much evidence to back up their claims.\n\nThe UNH Survey Center has a poll in the field on budget issues, with the results expected next week. Smith said the ongoing battle likely isn\u2019t making waves beyond Concord and shouldn\u2019t hurt Hassan or legislative Republicans much.\n\nOutside money is flowing into the state, too. Republican-aligned Crossroads GPS and Impact America Action ran digital and radio ads calling Hassan a tax-and-spend governor while the Democratic group Senate Majority PAC launched an online ad campaign against Ayotte.\n\nHassan is raising campaign cash, too. Her political committee has sent fundraising emails based off her veto of gun legislation as well as the budget stalemate. Federal campaign finance laws say money cannot be transferred from state to federal campaign accounts, but if Hassan were to run for Senate that money could be used to buoy fellow New Hampshire Democrats.\n\nDemocrats\u2019 chances of defeating Ayotte are likely to drop substantially if Hassan takes a pass.\n\n\u201cIf Hassan decides she is going to run for governor and not for Senate, whoever the Democrats run for Senate is going to do it under the assumption that they\u2019re going to lose,\u201d Smith said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "With state budget negotiations likely stalled until the fall, so too is Gov.
