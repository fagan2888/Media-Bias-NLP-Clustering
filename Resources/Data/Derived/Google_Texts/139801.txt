Miller said that the expansion of privately insured households next year under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act will create a new market for the company, but the newly insured were not the reason the joint venture was formed.Newly insured patients will enter a healthcare billing system that is “flat-out broken,” said Blaszyk, The newly created joint venture will seek to simplify billing, he said.This is the second deal between Dignity Health and UnitedHealth. The partners formed a joint venture, SharedClarity , last year to manage costs for physician preference items.Dignity brings “certain equipment and the intellectual property related to its internal revenue-cycle management functions” to the joint venture, the system's financial records said. Dignity Health, which includes 37 hospitals in three states, reported $9.4 billion in patient revenue for the year that ended June 30.The new business will include 3,000 employees from the health system and OptumInsight.The deal is the latest to diversify Dignity Health's operations. In July 2012, the system paid $455 million for U.S. HealthWorks Medical Group, which operates occupational health and urgent-care centers.Dignity Health's entry into revenue cycle management follows a similar move in mid-2012 by Catholic Health Initiatives, Englewood, Colo., which became a minority owner of the revenue-cycle company Conifer Health Solutions Follow Melanie Evans on Twitter: @MHmevans
