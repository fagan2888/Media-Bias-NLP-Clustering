When Gallup compiled a list of the most miserable states in the U.S. earlier this year, West Virginia came in number one.\n\nLess than half of residents there describe themselves as thriving, and they also report low levels of life expectancy and household income. But in the southwest corner of the state, a movement is under way to change that by changing its approach to health and its place in the community.\n\nOnce again to Hari Sreenivasan.\n\nHARI SREENIVASAN: Williamson, West Virginia, has been known for a few things over the years, as a coal town, a mountain town, a feuding town made famous by the Hatfields and McCoys, but Williamson, West Virginia, has never been a running town.\n\nIn fact, it\u2019s one of the least healthy places in the United States. So the fact that hundreds of locals are now showing up for monthly 5K races is a sign of something deeper here, an unexpected shift toward better health in coal country.\n\nDr. Dino Beckett is among those responsible for the new energy. When he moved back home after medical residency, Beckett\u2019s main goal was expanding basic health care in this part of the state.\n\nDR. DINO BECKETT, Williamson Health and Wellness Center: Everyone was why would you go back to southern West Virginia to practice medicine? And I really couldn\u2019t think of a better place to be, because it was such a joy to grow up here and have these people look out for you and help you with whatever was going on in your life.\n\nHARI SREENIVASAN: More so, Beckett thought he could do something about the challenges they faced, including some of the highest rates of diabetes, hypertension and obesity in both the state and the nation.\n\nNearly a quarter of the city\u2019s 3,000 residents live below the federal poverty line, and to make matters worse, the coal industry has been shedding jobs by the thousands in recent years, wiping out much of the area\u2019s private health insurance base.\n\nDR. DINO BECKETT: Mr. Charles, how are you doing?\n\nHARI SREENIVASAN: Before he found Dr. Beckett, Herb Charles was among the unemployed coal miners who had simply stopped going to the doctor. His family qualified for Medicaid like many in this area, but for the longest time, he couldn\u2019t find a primary care physician who would accept it.\n\nDR. DINO BECKETT: I\u2019m going to take a listen.\n\nHARI SREENIVASAN: Beckett\u2019s first idea to fill the growing health gap was to open a free clinic.\n\nDR. DINO BECKETT: We had it once a month, and we became inundated with patients that didn\u2019t have insurance, so we decided to start having it more frequently.\n\nHARI SREENIVASAN: But that wasn\u2019t nearly enough either. Eventually, he met up with Monica Niess and Selim Sandoval, who work with a consulting company called The Write Choice Network.\n\nSELIM SANDOVAL, Write Choice Network: That goes in the sink, honey.\n\nHARI SREENIVASAN: They couple travel the country in an R.V. with their two little girls helping communities like Williamson apply for government dollars to establish what is known as federally qualified health centers, or, more simply, clinics that treat people regardless of their insurance status, usually in low-income communities.\n\nThese centers receive a big financial boost under the Affordable Care Act. And after Niess and Sandoval\u2019s successful application, one came to Williamson. It changed the game.\n\nMONICA NIESS, Write Choice Network: Instead of having programs that are coming and going and depending on grant funding, by rolling them under the health umbrella of the health center, and being able to use our federal funding, as well as our revenue generation to support these programs, it sustains all of these programs and all the efforts into the future.\n\nHARI SREENIVASAN: The Williamson Health and Wellness Center opened earlier this year with 13 staff members able to see anyone who comes through the door, from the elderly to newborns.\n\nBut the center\u2019s most aggressive fight is taking place outside these walls. Vicki Hatfield is a nurse practitioner with the Diabetes Coalition, the outreach wing of the operation.\n\nVICKI HATFIELD, Mingo County Diabetes Coalition: I always say, if you can\u2019t treat diabetes as a practitioner in Southern West Virginia, you better move, because you\u2019re going to see a lot of it.\n\nHARI SREENIVASAN: She says nearly 14 percent of the local population is diabetic.\n\nVICKI HATFIELD: You look so pretty.\n\nHARI SREENIVASAN: Hatfield and her colleagues visit the most worrisome of these patients, like Janette Hunter, directly in their homes.\n\nVICKI HATFIELD: Can you tell me where I\u2019m touching?\n\nHARI SREENIVASAN: They check vital signs, monitor insulin intake and, perhaps most important, offer practical advice on day-to-day habits.\n\nVICKI HATFIELD: I always say, it has to be more than medicine.\n\nHARI SREENIVASAN: It\u2019s meant that, in recent months, Hunter\u2019s blood sugar level have stabilized, from consistently high to nearly perfect.\n\nVICKI HATFIELD: Keep up the good work.\n\nWOMAN: OK. Thank you.\n\nHARI SREENIVASAN: Leaders here say the next step to getting the whole town healthy is to boost the economy and increase access to healthier food. But that part of the plan is still under construction, literally.\n\nRemember Herb Charles, the unemployed coal miner? Just the other day, he was hired full-time by a construction company that is currently restoring an old building downtown. When the dust clears, the so-called Health Innovation Hub, another offshoot of the Health Center, will serve as a space for budding entrepreneurs to find the support they need to open more businesses, like Debbie Young\u2019s (ph) new restaurant, 34-8, which opened its doors just a few weeks ago after similar support from the Health and Wellness team.\n\nYoung plans to serve healthy food, some of it from the health coalition\u2019 new community garden, and perhaps someday from the farm being developed on a reclaimed strip mine several miles away.\n\nERIC MATHIS, Williamson Health and Wellness Center: Right here is what you all are going to help us design for growing specific foods for farmers market.\n\nHARI SREENIVASAN: Eric Mathis, the Health and Wellness Center\u2019s outreach coordinator for these projects, says it all shows that a new economy is emerging in the region.\n\nERIC MATHIS: We\u2019re looking forward to a day that is coming, coming soon, to where Central Appalachia can look out to the rest of the United States and say, catch up with us, we\u2019re the innovators.\n\nHARI SREENIVASAN: But that\u2019s a tough sell for many locals. Fred and Donna Baldwin have lived in this area their entire lives. They watched as the local economy collapsed, Fred lost his job in the mines, and their children moved away. They\u2019re skeptical that sustainable Williamson can repair what has been lost.\n\nDONNA BALDWIN: I\u2019m afraid that it won\u2019t be enough, because the way the economy is going, I\u2019m afraid that it\u2019s going to become a ghost town. And I would hate to see that happen, because we will lose a lot.\n\nHARI SREENIVASAN: It\u2019s not hard to find others who agree, but there seems to be just as many Williamson residents getting caught up in the optimism. On this Saturday, there\u2019s a new farmers market overflowing with locally grown produce, lively music, even a belly dancing troupe.\n\nAlmost everyone agrees the new energy is a welcome sight. The trick, they say, will be to keep it moving.\n\nSustainable Williamson received one of six Robert Wood Johnson Culture of Health awards, chosen from 250 entrants.
