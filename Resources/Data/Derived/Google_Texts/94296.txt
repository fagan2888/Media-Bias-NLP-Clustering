HCA's same-hospital admissions increased 1.2%, or 2.2% when adjusted for outpatient activity. Revenue per adjusted admission increased 5.4%, or 3.5% without accounting for the revenue from the Texas Medicaid program.HCA also held its expenses to 78.8% of revenue in the second quarter compared with 80.7% of revenue in the year-ago period.The chain had already previewed the strong results earlier this month, when it raised its financial guidance for the year. Like its peers LifePoint Hospitals and Universal Health Services , HCA is now factoring in a bigger benefit from healthcare reform than previously anticipated.After a slow start, the company saw a 7.8% increase in Medicaid admissions (or 8.8% when adjusted for outpatient activity) in the second quarter, Chief Financial Officer William Rutherford said on the call. Medicaid admissions increased just 1.4% (or 2.4% adjusted) during the first quarter of this year.In its four states that expanded Medicaid, HCA saw a 32% increase in Medicaid admissions on a year-to-date basis, and a 48% decline in uninsured volumes. The number of uninsured patients declined 2% in its non-expansion states.Overall, its self-pay and charity-care admissions declined 14.7%, Rutherford said, representing 6.8% of total admissions compared with 8.1% of admissions in the second quarter of last year.Visits to its emergency rooms increased 5.7%—the highest rate of growth in five quarters—with self-pay and charity patients accounting for 20.7% of the total compared with 23.4% in the prior-year period.HCA also said 5,500 admissions were patients enrolled in insurance plans sold on the new exchanges, and the company believes that 40% of that volume was previously uninsured, Rutherford said.Follow Beth Kutscher on Twitter: @MHbkutscher
