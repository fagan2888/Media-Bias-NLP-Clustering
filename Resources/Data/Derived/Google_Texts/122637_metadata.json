He is completing his seventh year in 4-H and has taken part in the beef competition each of those years. Lawson has earned the Grand Champion title four times and Reserve Champion twice.\n\nKnowing the animal likely will end up at a processing plant is difficult when 4-H'ers first start out, he said, still, he names his steers and devotes all the time and attention required to produce an award-winning animal.\n\n\"It was hard the first couple of years,\" he said. \"It gets easier as you go on \u2014 you know this is what's going to happen at the end, so you tell yourself to prepare for it.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLawson's animals are born and raised on his family's ranch in Wetmore. He is looking at babies now to determine which one will be entered into next year's fair. Once an animal is selected, its feeding plan is different than that of the other animals. Instead of ranging, the beef is fed grain, three times a day, and his weight is closely monitored. Entrants must weigh no less than 1,000 pounds, and no more than 1,450 pounds, he said.\n\nLawson's beef this year was purchased Sunday for $6,600 by Kwik Stop. He said not having to purchase an animal for the following year helps keep his out-of-pocket expenses down. Since the feed does get expensive, putting up hay also helps to cuts down on costs. Lawson said he always makes his money back from the sales, which is added to his college fund.\n\n\"It's always a great honor (to earn Grand Champion),\" he said. \"It's hard to do, but it's something you take a lot of pride in.\"\n\nIn addition to the Fremont County Fair, Lawson sometimes brings his animals to the Stock Show in Denver and the State Fair in Pueblo.\n\nTo prepare for the shows, he sets up a mock arena and leads his animal with a show stick. He also washes and blows out the fur regularly. Adding hair product helps the fur to shine. The day of the show Lawson clips the animal's hair on their necks and brisket.\n\n\"Since we got out of school, we get up every day and wash him and blow him out,\" he said. \"We get him out and walk him, which is good exercise for him.\"\n\nLawson said contest participants also keep a record book after the fair.\n\n\"It's basically a summary that lists all the expenses, and you have to write a story on your animal,\" he said. \"You also have to do inventory.\"\n\nBased on their results at the market competition and their record books, participants have a chance to win the Supreme Beef cash-prize award. It looks at the animal's carcass and fat to meat ratio. Lawson won that award last year.\n\nLawson is the son of Tuffy Lawson and Lisa Lawson. After high school, he is considering a career in computer design or computer engineering.\n\nCarie Canterbury: 719-276-7643, canterburyc@canoncitydailyrecord.com", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.canoncitydailyrecord.com/ci_28576029/fremont-county-fair-dixon-lawson-wins-beef-grand", "modificationDate": "2015-08-03T06:37:32-0600", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site49/2015/0802/20150802__03DRSALEw~3_300.jpg", "sailthru.author": "By Carie Canterbury \n \n  The Daily Record", "description": "Preparing a steer for the Fremont County Livestock Sale begins long before the annual event, and the work continues even after the sale is final.\n\nDixon Lawson, 15, a sophomore at Florence High School, won grand champion Saturday for his beef, for the second consecutive year.", "ag": {"canon": "CanonCityDailyRecord:article:28576029:view"}, "startDate": "2015-08-02T20:55:01-0600", "og": {"url": "http://www.canoncitydailyrecord.com/ci_28576029/fremont-county-fair-dixon-lawson-wins-beef-grand", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site49/2015/0802/20150802__03DRSALEw~1.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Preparing a steer for the Fremont County Livestock Sale begins long before the annual event, and the work continues even after the sale is final.\n\nDixon Lawson, 15, a sophomore at Florence High School, won grand champion Saturday for his beef, for the second consecutive year.", "title": "Fremont County Fair: Dixon Lawson wins Beef Grand Champion for second consecutive year"}, "twitter": {"domain": "canoncitydailyrecord.com", "description": "Preparing a steer for the Fremont County Livestock Sale begins long before the annual event, and the work continues even after the sale is final.\n\nDixon Lawson, 15, a sophomore at Florence High School, won grand champion Saturday for his beef, for the second consecutive year.", "title": "Fremont County Fair: Dixon Lawson wins Beef Grand Champion for second consecutive year", "url": "http://www.canoncitydailyrecord.com/ci_28576029/fremont-county-fair-dixon-lawson-wins-beef-grand", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site49/2015/0802/20150802__03DRSALEw~1.jpg", "site": "@CCDR_news", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-08-02T20:55:01-0600", "sailthru.site": "canoncitydailyrecord.com", "endDate": "2025-08-02T20:54:52-0600", "sailthru.title": "Fremont County Fair: Dixon Lawson wins Beef Grand Champion for second consecutive year", "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "sailthru.section": "Canon City Breaking News, Sports, Weather, Traffic", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "google-site-verification": "oCjqPZ-ii-IZW-fBJ0mmX5dmH5aafePG3FLx_kSYFiA", "byline": "By Carie CanterburyThe", "sailthru.image.full": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site49/2015/0802/20150802__03DRSALEw~3.jpg", "pubDate": "2015-08-02T20:58:24-0600", "news_keywords": "Canon City news, Colorado news, world news, national news, local news, business news, sports news, entertainment news, us news, Canon City Daily Record"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3e3c\"", "article_summary": "In addition to the Fremont County Fair, Lawson sometimes brings his animals to the Stock Show in Denver and the State Fair in Pueblo.\nWork for livestock sale a long processDixon Lawson prepares his market beef, Tyson, for the Fremont County 4-H Livestock Sale on Sunday.\nDixon Lawson, 15, a sophomore at Florence High School, won grand champion Saturday for his beef, for the second consecutive year.\nTyson won Grand Champion during the 2015 Fremont County Fair.\nLawson is the son of Tuffy Lawson and Lisa Lawson."}
