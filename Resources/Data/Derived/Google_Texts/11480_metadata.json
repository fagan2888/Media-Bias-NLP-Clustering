The team is provisionally three points ahead of third-place Arsenal, whose first of two games in hand is at Hull on Monday, and five clear of fourth-place Manchester United.\n\nTwo wins from its last three matches will secure City an automatic berth in Europe\u2019s top competition.\n\nCity kicked off at White Hart Lane less than an hour after being replaced as English champions by Chelsea. Yet a positive finish to the season is providing momentum going into next season - and increasing the chances of City manager Manuel Pellegrini keeping his job after a trophyless campaign.\n\n\u201cThey know we will be back next year,\u201d City goalkeeper Joe Hart said in a message to Chelsea.\n\nAguero has come good just when City needed him, with his fifth goal in the past four games making him likely to finish the season as the league\u2019s top scorer. Tottenham striker Harry Kane is second in the scoring charts with 20 goals and was denied on two occasions by Hart.\n\nAguero has a better scoring record against Spurs than any other team, with 10 goals in seven games against them. He netted all four in City\u2019s 4-1 win at Etihad Stadium in the reverse fixture in October.\n\nHis latest goal was sparked by a quick throw-out by Hart after collecting the ball from a corner. Silva charged downfield, before cutting inside and slipping a perfectly weighted pass to Aguero for the striker to hit a first-time shot past Hugo Lloris.\n\nAguero could have had a penalty earlier in the first half after having his legs clipped by Fazio, and nearly grabbed a second when he ran onto Fernandinho\u2019s pass, rounded Lloris and skewed his shot wide while stretching.\n\nTottenham had more possession - and had 21 shots - but could not find a way past Hart as Kane, Paulinho and Ryan Mason were defied.\n\n\u201cIt showed what we were about,\u201d the England goalkeeper said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t play well today (and) we\u2019ve done to Tottenham what teams have done to us.\u201d\n\nCity ended a run of four straight away defeats in the league.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Manchester City responded to officially losing its Premier League title by beating Tottenham 1-0 through Sergio Aguero's goal to cement second place on Sunday.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Manchester City responded to officially losing its Premier League title by beating Tottenham 1-0 through Sergio Aguero\u2019s goal to cement second place on Sunday.", "title": "Aguero earns Man City 1-0 win at Spurs in Premier League", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/may/3/aguero-earns-man-city-1-0-win-at-spurs-in-premier-/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/05/03/1d5d9571cee27013750f6a706700c78b.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/05/03/1d5d9571cee27013750f6a706700c78b.jpg", "title": "Aguero earns Man City 1-0 win at Spurs in Premier League", "description": "Manchester City responded to officially losing its Premier League title by beating Tottenham 1-0 through Sergio Aguero's goal to cement second place on Sunday.", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d"}, "article_summary": "City has recovered from a slump to win its last three matches and virtually guarantee a place in the Champions League next season.\nLONDON (AP) - Manchester City responded to officially losing its Premier League title by beating Tottenham 1-0 through Sergio Aguero\u2019s goal to cement second place on Sunday.\nTottenham striker Harry Kane is second in the scoring charts with 20 goals and was denied on two occasions by Hart.\nSilva charged downfield, before cutting inside and slipping a perfectly weighted pass to Aguero for the striker to hit a first-time shot past Hugo Lloris.\nTottenham had more possession - and had 21 shots - but could not find a way past Hart as Kane, Paulinho and Ryan Mason were defied."}
