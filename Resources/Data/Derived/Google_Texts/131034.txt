Julio Portalatin, president and CEO of Mercer, is urging Congressional leaders to reconsider the increases in premiums to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp. authorized with the passage of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015.

In a letter to the majority and minority leaders of both chambers of Congress, Portalatin called the increases “unnecessary” and “counterproductive” to PBGC’s goal of protecting and enhancing the country’s retirement security.
