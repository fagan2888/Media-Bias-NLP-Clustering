You\u2019re about to watch two planes collide in mid-air with nine skydivers in total aboard \u2014 four of them outside the plane, on the step and ready to jump, when impact occurs. Death toll: Zero, with one of the pilots suffering only minor injuries. Believe it or not, the pilot in the second plane was able to steer it safely back to the airport. Tell me how likely any of those details seem to you after you watch the clip.\n\nTo a man, the divers say they\u2019re willing to jump again in the future. I\u2019m treating the clip as a metaphor for the shutdown and the RINO/tea party infighting during and after: It was explosive and potentially disastrous for the GOP, but everyone got out OK thanks to their ObamaCare parachutes. Onward to the midterms!\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "Bail out.", "title": "Video: The freaky triple deaky \u201cskydivers\u2019 planes collide\u201d clip", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2013/11/05/video-the-freaky-triple-deaky-skydivers-planes-collide-clip/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "article": {"published_time": "2013-11-05T23:01:53+00:00", "modified_time": "2013-11-05T19:24:20+00:00"}, "keywords": "collide, collision, NBC, planes, skydivers,", "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "article_summary": "Video: The freaky triple deaky \u201cskydivers\u2019 planes collide\u201d clipposted at 6:01 pm on November 5, 2013 by AllahpunditTo cleanse the palate before election-night coverage begins, video proof that truth can be stranger than fiction even when the fiction\u2019s directed by Michael Bay.\nYou\u2019re about to watch two planes collide in mid-air with nine skydivers in total aboard \u2014 four of them outside the plane, on the step and ready to jump, when impact occurs.\nTo a man, the divers say they\u2019re willing to jump again in the future.\nBelieve it or not, the pilot in the second plane was able to steer it safely back to the airport.\nTell me how likely any of those details seem to you after you watch the clip."}
