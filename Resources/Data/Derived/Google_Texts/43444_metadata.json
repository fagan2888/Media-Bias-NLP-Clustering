Biden has publicly supported Roe v. Wade and legal abortion, the legal redefinition of marriage to include same-sex couples, taxpayer funding for embryonic stem cell research, and the HHS contraception/sterilization/abortifacient mandate.\n\n\u201cBiden\u2019s positions on all these issues are directly contrary to Church teaching,\u201d wrote the students. \u201cHis public service has not been \u2018to the Church,\u2019 but largely against the Church.\u201d\n\nRemarking on Biden\u2019s support for the HHS mandate, the students noted, \u201cNotre Dame itself is suing the federal government for relief from this mandate.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe object to Notre Dame\u2019s decision to honor Vice President Biden with the Laetare Medal. Giving the award to Speaker Boehner at the same time does not alleviate the scandal committed by the University\u2019s blatant disregard for the injunction of the Catholic bishops,\u201d the students wrote, referring to the U.S. bishops\u2019 2004 document \u201cCatholics in Political Life.\u201d\n\nCheck out the full coverage by the Cardinal New Society click here", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"url": "http://www.theglobaldispatch.com/notre-dame-students-express-outrage-over-joe-biden-being-honored-37081/", "image": "http://www.theglobaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Joe-Biden-donkey-hotey.jpg", "type": "website", "title": "Notre Dame students express outrage over Joe Biden being honored"}, "google-translate-customization": "7236b401605984b1-3bcbee0db8307092-g6f41da462829b1d2-19", "msvalidate.01": "F9A11A184D618AB8623122584A1DAB2D", "keywords": "Christian News, Religion News, 2016 Election, Outbreak News, Weird News, Movie News, US News, Breaking News, Internet News, Google News", "google-site-verification": "iI9n62s9s0Z-wJUY9p3-wGZp6AQYcH-Z1tDba2QiaT0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\u201cBiden\u2019s positions on all these issues are directly contrary to Church teaching,\u201d wrote the students.\n\u201cHis public service has not been \u2018to the Church,\u2019 but largely against the Church.\u201dRemarking on Biden\u2019s support for the HHS mandate, the students noted, \u201cNotre Dame itself is suing the federal government for relief from this mandate.\u201d\u201cWe object to Notre Dame\u2019s decision to honor Vice President Biden with the Laetare Medal.\nBiden has publicly supported Roe v.
