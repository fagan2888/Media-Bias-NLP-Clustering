The problem is Boewe set up his account five years ago so he took his letter to the local social security office.\n\n\"It just so happens there was a couple behind me that got the same kind of letter,\u201d Robert Boewe said.\n\nBoewe says that couple found out someone had gone online and redirected their checks to be directly deposited to a bank account in St. Louis.\n\n\"And so I went into the office and was finally interviewed and found out the same thing had happened to me,\u201d Boewe said.\n\nWe called the Regional Social Security Office in Kansas City to find out how this is happening but none of our calls were returned.\n\nWe did find a report delivered to congress from the Inspector General of the Social Security Administration. In it, he says as of June , 2013, his office has received more 37, 000 similar to Boewe's and they continue to receive about 50 new reports every day.\n\n\"It is tragic when people pray on seniors we need to do everything we can to protect them from this kind of fraud,\u201d Rep. Mike Pompeo said.\n\nRobert Boewe turns 70 this year. He says whoever got their hands on his information, tried to steal money he's been earning his entire life.\n\n\"At some point I will retire I'm not looking forward to it, I enjoy what I do. But it's just my money. I've been working since I was 14 years old,\u201d Boewe said.\n\nIf you think you've been a victim of social security fraud, call 1-800-772-1213.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "video", "description": "Tens of thousands of Americans have been scammed out of their social security checks and it's all being done online.", "language": "english", "author": "Parrish Alleman", "og": {"description": "Tens of thousands of Americans have been scammed out of their social security checks and it's all being done online.", "title": "Thieves Stealing Thousands Of Social Security Checks Online", "url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/Thieves-Stealing-Thousands-Of-Social-Security-Checks-223569151.html", "image": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/iupl/58E/B38/58EB38627953419CB64EEA7E6912718E", "video": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/3AD/7A9/3AD7A9393CF64CA5A350F149B292A5EC.mp4", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.kake.com", "description": "Tens of thousands of Americans have been scammed out of their social security checks and it's all being done online.", "title": "Thieves Stealing Thousands Of Social Security Checks Online", "url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/Thieves-Stealing-Thousands-Of-Social-Security-Checks-223569151.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/social+security+check.jpg", "creator": "@KAKEnews", "site": "@KAKEnews", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "video_type": "video/mp4", "video_height": 288, "keywords": "Thieves Stealing Thousands Of Social Security Checks Online", "google-site-verification": "H0mev8O__gMqb34WcvOyZgBXFMRQZvDAQ0YTSGJ9hGQ", "video_width": 512, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Thieves Stealing Thousands Of Social"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe04bf\"", "article_summary": "MGN OnlineThursday, September 12, 2013Tens of thousands of Americans have been scammed out of their social security checks and it's all being done online.\nIn march, the Social Security Administration made a change and now almost everyone who gets a social security check has them directly deposited into their account.\nWe called the Regional Social Security Office in Kansas City to find out how this is happening but none of our calls were returned.\nWe did find a report delivered to congress from the Inspector General of the Social Security Administration.\nLocal business owner Robert Boewe tells us this week he got a letter about his social security checks and the online account he supposedly just set up."}
