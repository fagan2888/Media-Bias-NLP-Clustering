However, estimates by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released this week show that 20,000 cases have occurred to date. The CDC estimates that the virus could spread to between 550,000 and 1.4 million people in the next four months.\n\nRelated: Can Ebola\u2019s Experimental Drugs Be Fast Tracked?\n\n\u201cExtensive, immediate actions - such as those already started - can bring the epidemic to... a rapid decline in cases,\u201d CDC said in a statement announcing their estimates.\n\nRight now, the virus has spread to Sierra Leone, Guinea, and Liberia, where thousands of cases have been documented. It\u2019s also popped up in Nigeria and Senegal.\n\nAs more details about the Obama administration\u2019s plan to stop the virus trickle out, it\u2019s becoming clear that the 3,000 soldiers the Pentagon plans to send to West Africa would be there to contain the virus and attempt to stop it from spreading outside of the region.\n\n\u201cAs we speak, America is deploying our doctors and scientists -- supported by our military -- to help contain the outbreak of Ebola and pursue new treatments,\u201d Obama said in a speech at the United Nations Wednesday.\n\nRelated: Why There\u2019s No Money in An Ebola Vaccine\n\nAccording to William Fisher, a pulmonologist at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill who treated Ebola patients over the summer, the key to stopping the virus from spreading further is stopping it in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the most populous country in Africa; it has tremendous natural resources. If Ebola gets into Lagos and takes hold in the population, the whole region is in trouble,\u201d he said at an event last week. \u201cNigeria is almost a powder keg of sorts.\u201d\n\nEconomic impact\n\nThe Ebola outbreak is already taking a toll on West Africa\u2019s fragile economies. This past spring, Nigeria was being celebrated as Africa\u2019s largest economy, with a GDP of $510 billion. Bismarck Rewane, CEO of the Financial Derivatives Company, a Lagos-based financial advisory and research firm that manages $18 million in assets, told CNBC Africa recently that Nigeria could now lose at least $3.5 billion of that GDP this year.\n\nAccording to the World Bank, Liberia\u2019s GDP will go down between 3.5 and 4.5 percent because of the outbreak. Amara Konneh, Liberian finance minister, has already lowered his GDP estimate because of Ebola.\n\nRelated: Ebola by the Numbers\n\nDavid Fidler, an associate fellow at the Center on Global Health Security at London's Chatham House, said that even if the outbreak is contained, significant damage has already been done.\n\n\u201cIf it doesn\u2019t get any worse, the impact on the region is adverse and very significant in an economic sense,\u201d Fidler said. \u201cWe have everything to fear.\u201d\n\nQuestions about DOD\u2019s role\n\nIt also remains unclear what the rule of engagement is for soldiers trying to contain the virus. Militaries in West Africa are far from trusted, and the sight of American soldiers in places where the United States is often vilified and where violence is common increases the potential for confrontations.\n\nThere has already been violence done to those trying to stop the outbreak. Last week, in Guinea, eight health workers and journalists were killed while trying to educate people about the disease.\n\nEven if DOD manages to contain the outbreak, Mwayabo Kazadi, an infectious disease expert at Catholic Relief Services, said it was just a matter of time before another outbreak occurs.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve come to where we are now because of the heath infrastructure in these countries,\u201d he said. \u201cIf they were stronger, we could contain the current outbreak, but in the long-term we have to fix the systems.\u201d\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The White House\u2019s $750 million stake to stop the spread of the Ebola virus could not be higher, with millions of lives and billions of dollars at risk if the dreadful virus spreads out of control.", "title": "The U.S. Is Trying to Stop an Ebola Pandemic", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/09/25/US-Trying-Stop-Ebola-Pandemic", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/09252014_Ebola_Relief.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/09/25/US-Trying-Stop-Ebola-Pandemic", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/09252014_Ebola_Relief.jpg", "creator": "@davidcfrancis", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "The White House\u2019s $750 million stake to stop the spread of the Ebola virus could not be higher, with millions of lives and billions of dollars at risk if the dreadful virus spreads out of control.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2d2c\"", "article_summary": "The World Health Organization estimates that 2,800 of at least 5,800 Ebola cases have ended in death.\n\u201cNigeria is almost a powder keg of sorts.\u201dEconomic impactThe Ebola outbreak is already taking a toll on West Africa\u2019s fragile economies.\nThere has already been violence done to those trying to stop the outbreak.\nThe White House\u2019s $750 million stake to stop the spread of the Ebola virus could not be higher, with millions of lives and billions of dollars at risk if the dreadful virus spreads out of control.\n\u201cWe have everything to fear.\u201dQuestions about DOD\u2019s roleIt also remains unclear what the rule of engagement is for soldiers trying to contain the virus."}
