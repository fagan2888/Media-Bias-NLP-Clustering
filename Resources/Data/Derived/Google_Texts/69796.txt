NEW YORK (MainStreet) — Since its passage in 2010, the Affordable Care Act has been the target of its share of controversy, some of which manifested last summer during the U.S. Supreme Court case Burwell v. Hobby Lobby. For that case, the court ruled in favor of Hobby Lobby, allowing the company an exemption from the ACA mandate to offer health insurance coverage of certain kinds of contraception.

The ruling opened up the floodgates of a debate on whether businesses and insurers have the right to refuse coverage of medical contraceptive methods based on religious beliefs.

But religion doesn’t always--or even usually--dictate women’s views on contraception. In particular, a new study out of the University of Michigan and published last month in the international health journal Contraception finds a woman’s religious faith rarely predicts her opinions on policies that impact reproductive health care.

The study, based on a survey of women of various faiths, found that the majority of Protestant and Catholic women polled -- 66% and 63%, respectively -- favored insurance coverage of contraceptives. This is a higher rate than even those women who did not identify as religious, of whom only 59% favored contraception coverage.

“The study’s results are in line with similar polling on Catholic voters,” says Katie Breslin, the domestic associate for Catholics for Choice . “It’s clear that Catholics follow their consciences when it comes to reproductive healthcare.”

Overall, 56% of the women surveyed supported mandated health coverage of contraceptives and less than a quarter (23%) believed employers should be exempt from the law due to religion.
