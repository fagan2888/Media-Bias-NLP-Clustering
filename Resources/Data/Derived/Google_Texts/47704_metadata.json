In comparison, Texas, which does not have an income tax, ranked at 47.\n\n\u201cThis is just Americans maximizing their opportunity,\u201d DeVore said.\n\nMost Californians are likely not moving to Texas specifically because of lower taxes and a lower regulatory burden, he said, but are rather going to where the jobs are.\n\nTexas came in as the sixth best place to do business in the U.S. in a broader Forbes assessment that included labor costs, regulatory laws, taxes and unemployment. California ranked at 37.\n\nDeVore said individuals may not necessarily take these factors into account when moving to a different state, but business owners are comparing tax structures and regulatory climates when deciding to relocate.\n\n\u201cThis is why we have 50 laboratories of democracy,\u201d he said. \u201cThose states that have more freedom attract more jobs and more workers. Those states with less freedom will generally see a lower rate of economic growth.\u201d\n\nBeyond seeking greater job opportunities, DeVore said people are likely leaving California because of its high cost of living, which currently ranks as the nation\u2019s third highest behind Hawaii and Washington, D.C.\n\nThe average rent in California\u2019s most expensive city, San Francisco, is $3,458 versus the average rent in Texas\u2019 most expensive city, Austin, which is $1,185.\n\nCalifornia\u2019s high cost of living is driven primarily by high housing prices, which DeVore said are inflated by government regulations that make it difficult to build in the state and in turn leaves the market unable to meet demand.\n\nHe said this artificially drives up the cost of rent and mortgage, \u201cmaterially damaging\u201d people\u2019s standard of living.\n\n\u201cWhen you have a very high percentage of your income going to shelter, as is the case with many Californians, it leaves less money for other necessities like food, clothing and transportation,\u201d DeVore said. \u201cThis puts a lot of pressure on both business owners and workers to move out of the state.\u201d\n\nUnless this changes, he said, California will continue to see large numbers of domestic outmigration.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Many went to Texas.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Many went to Texas.", "title": "5 Million People Left California Over the Past Decade", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150904_CaliforniaMigration_Johnson.jpg", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1KPGH4Y"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Many went to Texas.", "title": "5 Million People Left California Over the Past Decade", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150904_CaliforniaMigration_Johnson.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Economy", "tag": "economic freedom", "published_time": "2015-09-04T15:18:07+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "California, Texas, Chuck DeVore, cost of living, regulatory burden, economic freedom"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdca53\"", "article_summary": "About 5 million California residents left the Golden State during the past decade, marking an \u201cunprecedented\u201d number according to a report released this week.\nDuring that time period, about 3.9 million people moved to California from other states, leaving a net migration population loss of more than 1 million people.\nCalifornia has a 13.3 percent income tax, the highest in the U.S., and ranked as the fourth most taxed state in the nation, according to the Tax Foundation.\nTexas attracted more Californians than any other state, drawing 600,000 residents.\nThe average rent in California\u2019s most expensive city, San Francisco, is $3,458 versus the average rent in Texas\u2019 most expensive city, Austin, which is $1,185."}
