Our talented and dedicated people are the difference,\" Denton said.\n\nDenton said the boost was helped by the health system's new Northville Ambulatory Health Center, the Adult Emergency Critical Care Center and the new operating room capacity for adult patients.\n\nThe regents also approved the UMHS's 2016 proposed budget of $2.9 billion. Officials said they expect an even greater surplus this year, with a target 4 percent margin. The margin is based on increased patient activity and more \"effective management to reduce the rate of expense growth.\"\n\nUMHS Chief Financial Officer Paul Castillo said the health system's leaders are continuing to work on providing high-quality care while still containing cost growth.\n\nHe said the Affordable Care Act had an impact on clinical operations and financial health during the past year. The percentage of care paid for by Medicaid increased more than one percentage point, to 16.24 percent. That contributed to a decrease in uncompensated or \"charity\" care.\n\nIn the 2014 fiscal year the Health System provided more than $152 million in uncompensated care, while that number is expected to drop to $110 million by the end of the 2015 fiscal year.\n\n\"We can be very proud of achieving our financial target. We plan to continue to focus on adding value while improving operational efficiencies in the coming year,\" Castillo said.\n\nThe approved budget comes just weeks after the Health System confirmed with The Ann Arbor News its plans to cut about $13 million from its budget over the next two years.\n\nUMHS, with more than 22,000 employees, is about seven months into a two-year \"value margin improvement effort\" in which the network is focused on improving clinical capacity, improving efficiency and growing revenue, among other efforts.\n\n\"While our financial position is strong, like any well-run organization we continue to look for ways to manage costs and increase our contribution to our financial margin. Among our efforts are work teams in several parts of the health system (that) are looking at ways to work smarter,\" said Mary Masson, a spokeswoman for UMHS.\n\nMasson said no immediate plans call for job cuts within the health system, but if there is a reduction in staffing it will likely be from attrition.\n\nJeremy Allen is the University of Michigan reporter for The Ann Arbor News.
