Clarksville, TN – A trio of Austin Peay State University men’s tennis players will represent the Govs at the 2013 ITA Men’s All-American Championships, hosted by Tulsa.

Senior Jasmin Ademovic and juniors Dimitar Ristovski and Aleksas Tverijonas will compete in the Pre-Qualifying format, beginning Saturday, September 28th at the Michael D. Case Tennis Center in Tulsa, OK.

Ademovic continues his progression into the Govs No. 1 role after the departure of the Sean Bailey; he won Flight A of the Austin Peay Fall Open last weekend. The pair face off at 12:30pm (CT).

Ristovski will face Adriaan Du Toit from Fresno State at 11:30am. A sophomore from South Africa, Du Toit transferred to Fresno from Ole Miss following the 2012-13 season. He faces a veteran in Ristovski who fought through last season’s schedule to win a school-record 16 consecutive matches from February 8th to April 14th.

Tverijonas started last spring on an unprecedented roll, winning his first 15 matches during dual season. He will face Drake’s Grant Tesmer, a junior who went 16-4 last season while helping lead the Bulldogs to a sixth regular season title in seven seasons and third consecutive NCAA Tournament berth this past spring.

Pre-qualifying singles competition takes place Saturday and Sunday, with qualifying rounds beginning September 30th and running through October 2nd. The ITA All-American Championships Main Draw will be held October 3rd-6th.
