The freestanding emergency room concept is not new to Texas, but it is to Wichita Falls.\n\nAndy Lee Company and Hirschi Associates brokered the deal to bring Select ER here. Information about who brokered the Neighbors deal wasn't available.\n\nTracey Garman, a registered nurse and principal partner with Select ER, said there are more than 180 stand-alone emergency rooms including about 75 in Houston where she is based. She said the group that began Select ER has been in the business for seven years, but they wanted to branch out and create a new brand.\n\n\"We've taken the full services of a hospital emergency department and we've now located them conveniently in locations where neighbors are \u2014 neighborhoods, daily needs corners where it's convenient (and) people can see it and they don't always have to go to the busy emergency department at the hospital. They don't have to navigate a busy hospital,\" she said. \"They pull into the parking lot and walk right (through) the door.\"\n\nBruce McVeigh, chief operating officer for Houston-based Neighbors, said freestanding emergency rooms are redefining what emergency care is in regards to how quickly a patient can be seen. The retired Army hospital manager with multiple tours to the Middle East said the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act has resulted in more crowded hospital emergency rooms where patient satisfaction has dropped.\n\n\"That's the reason our guys formed the company,\" he said, \"to kind of enhanced and redefine that experience.\"\n\nBoth representatives said there respective businesses are full-service emergency rooms that can handle cases traditionally treated at hospital ERs. They said they will have trauma room, X-ray, labs and other services. In the event a patient needs to be hospitalized, they will be transferred to a hospital that can handle acute cases.\n\nLocal physicians, nurses and other specialties and support roles will be hired to man and operate the facilities, they said.\n\nThe pair also said people should be aware that a freestanding ER is not the same as an urgent care center and will be charged for an ER visit, not the less costly urgent care or walk-in setting. The companies accept most insurance, but because the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid does not recognize them as an ER, they are not able to accept Medicare, Medicaid or TRICARE as insurance.\n\nPhyllis Cowling, president and CEO of United Regional Health Care System, said she doesn't know what type of impact two stand-alone ERs will have on health care in the area. Her concern, she said, is patients might choose to go to a freestanding facility for something they believe is heartburn when in fact they could be having a heart attack and need to be transferred to United Regional for a higher level of care, creating an unnecessary step in the process.\n\n\"I do think that people need to be mindful and educated about when to use a freestanding emergency room and when not to,\" Cowling said. \"I think some people \u2014 it's easy to get confused and to think a freestanding emergency room is an urgent care clinic. It's not. If you go there, you're not going to get charged a clinic price ...\"\n\nKelly Fristoe, a health underwriter in Wichita Falls, said he has clients who have used stand-alone ERs for minor ailments and suffer sticker shock when they receive the bill. For example, he said a client went to such a place in College Station for a migraine headache and was billed thousands of dollars because the ER was out of network.\n\n\"As I've traveled around the state I've even seen commercials where they advertise that the ER will accept all insurance,\" he said. \"The consumer perceives that as, 'Oh, OK, so this ER is in my network and I've got benefits here.' Not so fast. Yes, they accept the insurance but the ER is usually not in the insurance networks.\"\n\nSelect ER has a target of February to open its doors, and Neighbors is shooting for the third week of April.", "article_metadata": {"title": "Standalone ERs set to open in spring", "og": {"url": "http://www.timesrecordnews.com/business/standalone-ers-set-to-open-in-spring-23176237-20fe-1ad0-e053-0100007f3f45-338077601.html", "image": {"width": 706, "identifier": "http://media.jrn.com/images/73228.jpg", "height": 900}, "type": "article", "description": "Wichita Falls will soon have two freestanding emergency rooms to accommodate area residents", "title": "Standalone ERs set to open in spring"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.jrn.com/images/73228.jpg", "title": "Standalone ERs set to open in spring", "description": "Wichita Falls will soon have two freestanding emergency rooms to accommodate area residents", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@timesrecordnews"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://media.jrn.com/designimages/logo-trn-icon-144.png", "__sync_contentCategory": "premium", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "The freestanding emergency room concept is not new to Texas, but it is to Wichita Falls.\nSelect ER has a target of February to open its doors, and Neighbors is shooting for the third week of April.\nBoth representatives said there respective businesses are full-service emergency rooms that can handle cases traditionally treated at hospital ERs.\n\"I do think that people need to be mindful and educated about when to use a freestanding emergency room and when not to,\" Cowling said.\nAndy Lee Company and Hirschi Associates brokered the deal to bring Select ER here."}
