The Military Religious Freedom Foundation wants a two-star general court-martialed because he spoke about his relationship with God.

Major General Craig Olson was a speaker last week at a National Day of Prayer gathering. He described himself in that speech as a "redeemed believer in Christ."

Mikey Weinstein called the general's remarks a "brutal disgrace." Mr. Weinstein is the president of the MRFF. He fired off a nasty letter to the Secretary of Defense calling for the Air Force general to be severely punished. He alleged that airmen were "utterly disgusted and shocked by the brazenly illicit and wholly unconstitutional, fundamentalist Christian proselytizing recently perpetrated on international television."

Mr. Weinstein demanded the general be court-martialed and "aggressively and visibly brought to justice for his unforgivable crimes and transgressions."

If the Military Religious Freedom Foundation thought General Olson was a brutal disgrace, I can only imagine what they must have thought of George Washington, who once prayed at Valley Forge.

It would be easy to dismiss this guy as a two-bit gadfly. Unfortunately, we cannot. Time and time again, Mr. Weinstein has proven that when he complains about something - the Pentagon responds.

Far too many Christians have been bullied by the Military Religious Freedom Foundation's thuggery. It's time for the Pentagon to put a stop to this nonsense.

If Mr. Weinstein and his stooges have a problem with the general's televised remarks, maybe they should just change the channel.
