Last year's festival was smoky from the Royal Gorge Fire and other wildfires burning across Colorado and in surrounding states.\n\n\"We couldn't have asked for better weather,\" said Kyle Horne, event organizer. \"It ended up being perfect. The water level was ideal conditions, we had plenty of participants, and people were really getting involved this year.\"\n\nA final visitor tally has not yet been finalized, but Horne said the weekend's turnout was \"tremendous.\"\n\n\"It's great to see the support of the Whitewater Festival continue to grow,\" he said. \"I think over the two-day event, without question, it was the largest turnout we have ever had at the Whitewater Festival.\"\n\nHe said people were spread out throughout Centennial Park and along the river, and the vendors seemed happy about the turnout.\n\nHe said attendees came from Mississippi, Arkansas, Louisiana, Texas, Kansas and other parts of the state.\n\n\"I think that we'll continue to put on a great show year after year and, of course, raise money for our community projects,\" he said.\n\nFremont Search and Rescue spent the weekend keeping an eye on the river and event competitors. Horne said organizers set up a safety plan to run at river levels of more than 3,200 cubic feet per second.\n\n\"Just because the river levels were down at 1,900 cfs, we didn't change anything,\" Horne said. \"The safety plan we had in place, we executed and it worked very well.\"\n\nRescuers did help some event participants with throw-bag assists and a safety kayaker went after a participant who was floating in the water. Horne said every participant had the required safety gear, including a personal floatation device and helmet, all provided by Raft Masters, Echo Canyon River Expeditions and Royal Gorge Rafting.\n\n\"We kept people safe, and they simply came on out and had a good time,\" he said. \"Search and Rescue played a big role in that.\"\n\nThe new events introduced this year were a success, including the pixie bike races, inner tube races and R-2 raft races. Also new this year, although unplanned, was a marriage proposal on stage. Horne hopes to add a big air kayak ramp next year.\n\n\"I think we've found a mix that works for the most part,\" he said. \"Now we are just going to continue to improve on things, tweak them and make them better.\"\n\nThe RGWF is a fundraiser for Fremont Adventure Recreation, Fremont Community Foundation, Ca\u00f1on City Park & Recreation District and WKRP. The The Ca\u00f1on City Rotary Club and the Florence/Eastern Fremont County Rotary Club also are partners in the event, Horne said.\n\nHorne said event proceeds stay in the community, going toward river restoration, Whitewater Park improvements, different charities, trail expansion and park improvements.\n\nTo view photos from the event, see the albums at https://facebook.com/CanonCityDailyRecord.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.canoncitydailyrecord.com/ci_26013199/tremendous-turnout-royal-gorge-whitewater-festival", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site49/2014/0622/20140622__23DRROUNDUPw~1_300.jpg", "sailthru.author": "By Carie Canterbury \n \n  canterburyc@canoncitydailyrecord.com", "description": "Whitewater Event  Results\n\n\nCommunity Raft Race\n\n\n\n\nPlace, team and guide\n\n\n\n\n1 - Royal Gorge Zipline, John Rice (Clear Creek)\n\n\n2 - Ca\u00f1on City Daily Record, Ty, Royal Gorge Rafting\n\n\n3 - My Brother's Place, Justin, River Runners\n\n\n4 - Royal Gorge Brew Pub, Jelly, American Adventure Expeditions\n\n\n5 - Fremont Community Foundation, Muppet, Whitewater Adventure Outfitters\n\n\n6 - Winery at Holy Cross Abbey, Will, Raft Masters\n\n\n7 - Ca\u00f1on Rental, Emily, Arkansas River", "ag": {"canon": "CanonCityDailyRecord:article:26013199:view"}, "startDate": "2014-06-22T16:27:09-0600", "og": {"url": "http://www.canoncitydailyrecord.com/ci_26013199/tremendous-turnout-royal-gorge-whitewater-festival", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site49/2014/0622/20140622__23DRROUNDUPw~1.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Whitewater Event  Results\n\n\nCommunity Raft Race\n\n\n\n\nPlace, team and guide\n\n\n\n\n1 - Royal Gorge Zipline, John Rice (Clear Creek)\n\n\n2 - Ca\u00f1on City Daily Record, Ty, Royal Gorge Rafting\n\n\n3 - My Brother's Place, Justin, River Runners\n\n\n4 - Royal Gorge Brew Pub, Jelly, American Adventure Expeditions\n\n\n5 - Fremont Community Foundation, Muppet, Whitewater Adventure Outfitters\n\n\n6 - Winery at Holy Cross Abbey, Will, Raft Masters\n\n\n7 - Ca\u00f1on Rental, Emily, Arkansas River", "title": "A 'tremendous' turnout for Royal Gorge Whitewater Festival"}, "twitter": {"domain": "canoncitydailyrecord.com", "description": "Whitewater Event  Results\n\n\nCommunity Raft Race\n\n\n\n\nPlace, team and guide\n\n\n\n\n1 - Royal Gorge Zipline, John Rice (Clear Creek)\n\n\n2 - Ca\u00f1on City Daily Record, Ty, Royal Gorge Rafting\n\n\n3 - My Brother's Place, Justin, River Runners\n\n\n4 - Royal Gorge Brew Pub, Jelly, American Adventure Expeditions\n\n\n5 - Fremont Community Foundation, Muppet, Whitewater Adventure Outfitters\n\n\n6 - Winery at Holy Cross Abbey, Will, Raft Masters\n\n\n7 - Ca\u00f1on Rental, Emily, Arkansas River", "title": "A 'tremendous' turnout for Royal Gorge Whitewater Festival", "url": "http://www.canoncitydailyrecord.com/ci_26013199/tremendous-turnout-royal-gorge-whitewater-festival", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site49/2014/0622/20140622__23DRROUNDUPw~1.jpg", "site": "@CCDR_news", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-06-22T16:27:09-0600", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "sailthru.title": "A 'tremendous' turnout for Royal Gorge Whitewater Festival", "sailthru.image.full": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site49/2014/0622/20140622__23DRROUNDUPw~1.jpg", "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "sailthru.section": "Canon City Breaking News, Sports, Weather, Traffic", "google-site-verification": "oCjqPZ-ii-IZW-fBJ0mmX5dmH5aafePG3FLx_kSYFiA", "modificationDate": "2014-06-22T16:28:08-0600", "endDate": "2024-06-22T16:26:50-0600", "byline": "By Carie Canterburycanterburyc@canoncitydailyrecord.com", "sailthru.site": "canoncitydailyrecord.com", "pubDate": "2014-06-22T16:28:31-0600", "news_keywords": "Canon City news, Colorado news, world news, national news, local news, business news, sports news, entertainment news, us news, Canon City Daily Record"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde370\"", "article_summary": "Thousands of people enjoyed picture-perfect weather and a smoke-free sky during Friday and Saturday's sixth annual Royal Gorge Whitewater Festival.\nLast year's festival was smoky from the Royal Gorge Fire and other wildfires burning across Colorado and in surrounding states.\nContestants in the Build Your Own Boat Race go through the whitewater feature at the Whitewater Kayak Recreation Park on the Arkansas River on Saturday during the sixth annual Royal Gorge Whitewater Festival.\nThe two-day event also featured a raft rodeo, a community raft race, a downriver kayak race, the Whitewater Adventure Race and more.\n\"I think over the two-day event, without question, it was the largest turnout we have ever had at the Whitewater Festival.\""}
