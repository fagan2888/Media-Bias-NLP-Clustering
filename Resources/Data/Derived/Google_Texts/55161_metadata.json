Mine, however, was not whether to fry it or grill it. Rather, my bird was an adolescent crow that ended up in my yard with a broken wing, \u201cLil\u2019 Crow,\u201d as he was named by my tender hearted seven-year-old son.\n\nThis episode of American life actually began a few days before Labor Day when Lil\u2019 Crow first appeared in our yard visibly injured. Notwithstanding a broken wing, Lil\u2019 Crow appeared otherwise healthy, running around my yard at a surprising clip. Lil\u2019 Crow\u2019s other major problem was the harassment he received from the other crows in his flock. Apparently, it is common crow behavior to kill a wounded member of the flock, or \u201cmurder,\u201d as a flock of crows is appropriately named. Seriously, look it up.\n\nI figured nature would run its course. Yet, defying my expectations, the next morning I woke up and there Lil\u2019 Crow was, in my kids\u2019 playhouse, desecrating it like Axl Rose at a hotel room. When I approached him, I took my dog, Gus, and his \u201cChuckit!,\u201d really just to try and clear away the merciless other crows. Lil\u2019 Crow panicked, jumped off the side of the playhouse, over the fence and, in an display of aeronautics worthy of Capt. Sullinger, managed a sort of controlled crash into my neighbor\u2019s yard and quickly scampered away. You can\u2019t save them all. I figured the issue was settled.\n\nNot so. On Labor Day, I awoke to find that Lil\u2019 Crow had managed to overcome the fence separating my neighbor\u2019s yard from ours and was once again being subjected to the ritualistic abuse of the other crows, This is where it gets real. My son, concerned about Lil\u2019 Crow\u2019s condition, now going on at least three days of injury, approached Lil\u2019 Crow to attempt to feed him. Gus, although he is 12, is still a Jack Russell, then promptly mauled Lil\u2019 Crow. Lil\u2019 Crow was only spared by the timely intervention of my son. Gus dropped Lil\u2019 Crow and my son then went inside to cry.\n\nI then was summoned and found, miraculously, that Lil\u2019 Crow was spooked, soggy, and ruffled, but otherwise none the worse for wear. But the matter had finally come to a head. Lil\u2019 Crow wasn\u2019t going anywhere and I couldn\u2019t have any more episodes of Animal Kingdom go down in front of my son or, worse, his little sister. Lil\u2019 Crow had to be caught.\n\nWhat ensued was a chase scene where I did my part to play the role of Roscoe P. Coltrane. Only at least Roscoe could say that the Duke boys had a souped up Dodge Charger and explosive arrows. Lil\u2019 Crow was down to one wing, and his brain is the size of a grape. I eventually wrangled Lil\u2019 Crow into a dog crate, the less that is said about the specifics the better, and was confronted with the question of what to do with him.\n\nWe had the recently been to the wonderful aviary for rehabilitating birds at Radnor Lake state park. I wasn\u2019t sure if they accepted crows but it was the only place I knew to start. The park was, astonishingly, open on Labor Day. The rangers weren\u2019t available but they promised to call back. In the meantime, the lady I spoke with gave me two numbers: Tennessee\u2019s wildlife agency and a private nonprofit specializing in wildlife rehabilitation. I called both agencies and left a message.\n\nThe nonprofit called me back later that day. We made arrangements to deliver Lil\u2019 Crow for treatment. Lil\u2019 Crow was soon bundled up and delivered and our minivan still smells like bird.\n\nI realize this is not Democracy in America, and I\u2019m not de Tocqueville, but this little incident sheds a bit of insight on the current state of the American experiment. Here are my takeaways:\n\nFirst, we have too many laws in this country. For all the internet research I did trying to figure out what to do with Lil\u2019 Crow, one thing was repeated over and over. Migratory birds like crows are protected and it is illegal to keep one without a permit. I understand why we shouldn\u2019t be keeping wildlife as pets. But this is a crow, not a bald eagle, and an injured one at that. It\u2019s really a crime to keep a hurt crow? Not only that, when we dropped of Lil\u2019 Crow, we asked about bringing our kids along. We were told no, because you need a separate permit for that, too. A Cub Scout troop can\u2019t even come visit a recuperating crow? Is there really even a place you can get, not one, but multiple variants of crow-related permits? Whether it is a crime to keep a hurt crow, even temporarily, before delivering him to someone with the proper permit is a question I did not explore. The absence of willful intent was probably my only legal defense short of expecting my son to take the charge for me, sort of the way Snoop recruited juveniles in The Wire.\n\nHad the nonprofit turned Lil\u2019 Crow away, I\u2019d have been out of options. The words, \u201cgive me liberty or give me death,\u201d being more than just words to me, I suspect I would have been forced to care for Lil\u2019 Crow had it come to that, in an act of civil, crow-related disobedience. And so what? What was the worst that could happen if I\u2019d cared for an crow unlicensed? Lil\u2019 Crow\u2019s situation was already terminal. Would it really have been preferable for me to have just thrown Lil\u2019 Crow out into my backyard to be hunted down by a gang of the other stronger, healthier crows like Rue from District 11? I don\u2019t think so. Won\u2019t someone think of the crows!\n\nSecond, how about the performance of a private, nonprofit entity whose concern and capacity extended even to a poor crow in need? Lil\u2019 Crow seemed like a decent enough little (lil\u2019) guy to me, but he\u2019s not exactly a California Condor. I remain pleasantly astonished at the sheer breadth of American generosity, extending even to indigent crow care. Speaking of de Tocqueville, American philanthropy fascinated him as well. Since the time he was writing in the 1800s, the number of nonprofits devoted to charitable causes has exploded. For all the carping you hear these days, this aspect of the American character appears alive and well. For this, all of us, and one, little (lil\u2019) crow, should be grateful.\n\nThe next time someone accuses you of a lack of compassion when you don\u2019t agree that the government should intervene to solve this or that problem remember all this. The government isn\u2019t the only game in town. You can disagree about how a problem should be solved and still care. Some might argue that a preference for a non-governmental solution is evidence of concern. Given the government\u2019s track record, we ought to seriously consider this position. It\u2019s worth pointing out that in the matter of Lil\u2019 Crow, I called three numbers: two were government and one was a nonprofit. One government number never called me back. The other did, but only to tell me they couldn\u2019t help. The nonprofit called me back on a federal holiday and agreed to care for our crow free of charge.\n\nThere\u2019s another benefit to all of this that tends to get unmentioned in these sorts of discussions. We donated $100 when we dropped off Lil\u2019 Crow at the nonprofit. That is, we gave it voluntarily. We (more \u201cI\u201d than \u201cwe\u201d) would probably pitch a fit if someone tried to add $100 to our yearly taxes to provide health care to crows, but writing this check wasn\u2019t hard. Consider this: charity softens hearts; coercion hardens them. This whole episode wasn\u2019t just good for the public interest in wildlife protection. It was good for us.\n\nIn closing, I still feel pretty good about the American character and its commitment to humankind. Our leaders ought to question if we need to be forced to care for others. And governmental welfare agencies have a way of crowding out true philanthropies. It troubles me that Obamacare threatens to do away with nonprofit hospitals, and the continuing need for organizations even as venerable as Alcoholics Anonymous is not beyond questioning. The opinion page of the Washington Post is openly questioning the need for tax exempt status for churches by arguing that the government should be handling social services. Can nonprofit charities endure? When they come for crow related charities, it\u2019ll be time to break out the pitchforks. But I just don\u2019t think this is a battle we can lose. Americans are that decent. I have more important things to worry about. Like whether Febreze can get out the smell of bird out of car upholstery.\n\nThis piece was first published by the Beacon Center of Tennessee.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Our leaders ought to question if we need to be forced to care for others.
