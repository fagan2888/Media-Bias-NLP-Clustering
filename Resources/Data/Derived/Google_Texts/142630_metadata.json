John Kasich\u2019s Obamacare expansion passed another exciting milestone last month: $6 billion in new federal spending!\n\nCan you believe how generous Kasich is with your money? He\u2019s a regular Prince of Light and Hope.\n\nMedicaid benefits for Ohio\u2019s 650,000 Obamacare expansion enrollees cost $406 million in December. For context, that was more than the state\u2019s higher education and criminal justice spending combined.\n\nIf you\u2019re a fan of Obamacare, this represents a rip-roaring success. If you\u2019re not, I should clarify that we are, in fact, talking about the John Kasich who is running for president as a Republican.\n\nSince January 2014, Kasich\u2019s expansion of Medicaid to working-age adults with no kids and no disabilities has added 5% of Ohio\u2019s population to the welfare rolls and has cost federal taxpayers $6.4 billion.\n\nIn 2013, before Kasich vetoed the Ohio General Assembly\u2019s ban on Obamacare expansion and expanded Medicaid unilaterally, critics said costs and enrollment would be higher than expected.\n\nWho was right?\n\nKasich projected enrollment would reach 447,000 in 2020. He underestimated costs for the first 18 months by $1.5 billion.\n\nIn a speech this week to the New Hampshire House of Representatives, Kasich boasted about saving lives by spending $14 billion to put more Ohioans on Medicaid\u2026 and then, seconds later, he bragged about slowing Ohio Medicaid spending growth.\n\nKasich\u2019s $14 billion figure \u2014 the amount of \u201cOhio money\u201d he says he\u2019s \u201cbringing back\u201d \u2014 is an old estimate of Obamacare expansion costs through 2020. Based on actual spending, Kasich is understating costs by at least $10 billion.\n\nOf course, there is no vault of \u201cOhio money\u201d for Kasich to \u201cbring back\u201d to the state, just like there\u2019s no vault of New Jersey money paying for Chris Christie\u2019s Obamacare expansion. It\u2019s all new federal spending.\n\nAssuming Obamacare isn\u2019t repealed under a Republican president, Ohio will be on the hook for 5% of the expansion\u2019s benefit costs next year and 10% in 2020. Where\u2019s that state match of $40 million+ per month going to come from?\n\nBy design, Obamacare expansion\u2019s promised 90% federal match rate will make states prioritize welfare spending on childless, able-bodied, working-age adults over programs for the truly needy.\n\nBut maybe it\u2019s silly to see Kasich\u2019s Obamacare expansion as the worst policy implemented in Ohio in 30 years.\n\nIn the interest of fun and fairness, following are several counterarguments from Obamacare expansion supporters. See if you can guess who said each line: Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders, or Martin O\u2019Malley.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019d have to have a heart of stone or a very hard heart not to understand the changes that have come that have been really positive\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve got this money, and I haven\u2019t heard one good reason why we shouldn\u2019t take it. Frankly, it\u2019s just either purely ideological or political.\u201d \u201cMedicaid expansion is no different than the current Medicaid program, and when people try to tie Medicaid to Obamacare, I don\u2019t see the connection\u201d \u201cThere really is not a legitimate argument against it\u201d \u201cI couldn\u2019t conceive of a half a million people all of a sudden waking up one day and having no health care coverage as provided under this program\u201d\n\nScroll down for the answers.\n\nReady for the answers?\n\nHere we go:\n\nJohn Kasich John Kasich John Kasich John Kasich John Kasich\n\nThese quotes are only a sample of the condescending pro-Obamacare rhetoric Preacher Kasich\u2019s Obamacare Roadshow has been hawking across the country since 2013.\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "Heaps and heaps of free money", "title": "Tab for John Kasich\u2019s Obamacare expansion tops $6 billion", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2016/01/21/tab-for-john-kasichs-obamacare-expansion-tops-6-billion/", "image": {"secure_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/Rm7CsGtzhBA/0.jpg", "identifier": "http://img.youtube.com/vi/Rm7CsGtzhBA/0.jpg"}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary", "creator": "@hotairblog"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "article": {"published_time": "2016-01-22T03:01:23+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-01-21T23:57:12+00:00"}, "keywords": "John Kasich, Medicaid, Medicaid expansion, ObamaCare, obamacare expansion, ohio medicaid expansion,", "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "article_summary": "Here we go:John Kasich John Kasich John Kasich John Kasich John KasichThese quotes are only a sample of the condescending pro-Obamacare rhetoric Preacher Kasich\u2019s Obamacare Roadshow has been hawking across the country since 2013.\nTab for John Kasich\u2019s Obamacare expansion tops $6 billionposted at 10:01 pm on January 21, 2016 by Jason HartOhio Gov.\nJohn Kasich\u2019s Obamacare expansion passed another exciting milestone last month: $6 billion in new federal spending!\nBut maybe it\u2019s silly to see Kasich\u2019s Obamacare expansion as the worst policy implemented in Ohio in 30 years.\nKasich\u2019s $14 billion figure \u2014 the amount of \u201cOhio money\u201d he says he\u2019s \u201cbringing back\u201d \u2014 is an old estimate of Obamacare expansion costs through 2020."}
