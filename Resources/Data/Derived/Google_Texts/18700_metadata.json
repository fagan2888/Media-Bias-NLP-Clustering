Bernie Sanders, a self-proclaimed \u201csocialist\u201d and lover of all free things, who currently leads Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton by double digits when it comes to millennial voters.\n\nOn the right, millennials are expected to support businessman and Republican front-runner Donald Trump, a self-proclaimed \u201cwinner\u201d and anti-establishment candidate, who holds a dramatic lead among millennials over the large field of GOP candidates.\n\nThe power of the millennial voting bloc was revealed in 2008, when 66 percent of young voters backed Barack Obama over Sen. John McCain.\n\nBut will millennials show up again? Mr. Sanders and Mr. Trump are borrowing some of President Obama\u2019s emotional themes to ensure they do.\n\nOn the left, Mr. Sanders has drawn massive support from millennial voters who are sick of the status quo and intrigued by his \u201cangry\u201d campaign style and offers of free college tuition and health care.\n\nOn the right, Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201cno nonsense,\u201d politically incorrect campaign has brought in the support of countless young voters who are fed up with the establishment and hope to \u201cmake America great again.\u201d\n\nBut, while millennials on both sides of the aisle are unhappy and looking to fresh candidates for new leadership, they are clearly supporting these top contenders for very different reasons.\n\nWhile supporters of Mr. Sanders are surprisingly all for socialism in the United States, an ideology fundamentally against the ethos of American capitalism, supporters of Mr. Trump are hoping for increased economic opportunity and growth.\n\nRegardless of their contrasting ideologies, Mr. Trump and Mr. Sanders are dominating the millennial vote and will certainly not be easy for their opponents to defeat as the presidential primary season kicks of in Iowa on Monday.\n\n\u2022 Madison Gesiotto is a staff editor for the Ohio State Journal of Criminal Law.
