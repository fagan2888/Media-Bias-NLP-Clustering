EDITOR: I encourage all of you to be a part of the University of Wisconsin-Stevens Point and American Cancer Societyâ€™s Relay for Life event this month. This event raises money to support both research and patient care to cure cancer. Student volunteers lead and coordinate this event, along with the help of community partners. This year, the event is from 6 p.m. April 29 to 6 a.m. April 30. Teams can volunteer to walk on the relay track in honor of friends or family afflicted with cancer, and raise money for the cause. Fun activities are set up to encourage teams throughout the evening.

Please consider being a part of this event. Sign up at www.relayforlife.org, or look for us on Facebook at Relay for Life of University of Wisconsin Stevens Point. See you there.

Bonnie Samuelson,

UWSP
