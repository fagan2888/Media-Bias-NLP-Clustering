Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, told Politico. Two other sources confirmed Hatch\u2019s account.\n\nThe news brought a swift response from Darrell Issa, R-Calif., chairman of the House Committee On Oversight and Government Reform. In a statement late last night, Issa said:\n\nIf the IRS truly got rid of evidence in a way that violated the Federal Records Act and ensured the FBI never got a crack at recovering files from an official claiming a Fifth amendment protection against self-incrimination, this is proof their whole line about \u2018losing\u2019 emails in the targeting scandal was just one more attempted deception.
