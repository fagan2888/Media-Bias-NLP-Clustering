Trump has been critical of the Iran nuclear agreement, which was made public this month. \u201cThey\u2019re bringing crime. They\u2019re rapists and some, I assume, are good people\u201d.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not a war hero\u201d, Trump said recently of McCain. \u201cI was their fair-haired boy\u201d. \u201cYes please.\u201d Wendy Ansley writes \u201cGO TRUMP!!!\u201d Most politicians aren\u2019t so candid. According to the Republicans\u2019 provocateur-in-chief, Graham wanted a \u201cgood reference\u201d to \u201cFox & Friends\u201d, a show on the network that conservatives revere, and then whether \u201che could come and see me for some campaign contribution\u201d. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you bring up the positive polls\u201d, Trump demanded.\n\nNow, Derbyshire is more of a restrictionist in terms of immigration.\n\nFor some, the remarks sparked fear of a growing anti-immigrant movement. \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t be talking about Obamacare right now if we didn\u2019t have Roberts\u201d. \u201cI would deal very differently\u201d. Not one to keep quiet, Trump reacted in the completely adult fashion by calling her a hypocrite. \u201cThey have failed, and Texas has stepped in, and done the best they could do to help secure that border\u201d.\n\n\u201cI thought it was bad\u201d, Trump told Cooper on CNN of the arrest and later death in police custody of Sandra Bland, an African American woman from Texas.\n\nOf course, the relevant question this morning in regard to Trump might be who he\u2019s going to attack, as opposed to what sort of immigration actions he\u2019ll espouse.\n\nCuellar said he encourages candidates to visit Laredo and the border, adding that Hillary Clinton, whom he is a \u201cstrong support of\u201d visited twice during her 2008 run. A lot of illegal immigrants are visa overstayers. And I don\u2019t think Americans are when they really take take a \u2013 this is a guy who\u2019s for single-payer healthcare.\n\nYes, some illegal immigrants are rapists, some are murderers, and some are drug pushers. While the 2016 race is heating up with candidates including Hillary Clinton, Jeb Bush, Bernie Sanders and more, one candidate in particular stands out for reasons all his own: Donald Trump. \u201cWe\u2019re going to push back, and we\u2019re push back hard.'\u201d. It\u2019s one thing to argue: \u201cHey, don\u2019t let that unskilled applicant with a long rap sheet get a green card\u201d and quite another to paint with a broad brush, as Trump has.\n\nBut over in the current events department, we get to the even more troublesome part, at least politically when it comes to reform.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s scary, not just what he says, but in terms of people supporting that\u201d, said Guevara, who works for a nonprofit organization and who will be voting in her first presidential election next year. Immigration is often a curious exception. It is unclear if the federal government is providing any cooperation or coordination for the trip. \u201cAs far as the debate is concerned, these politicians debate every night\u201d.\n\nSecond, the poll contains the seeds of Trump\u2019s demise. They shouldn\u2019t.\n\nMost experts agreed that his candidacy hurt President Bush, taking away the votes of independent and moderate Republicans attracted by Perot\u2019s fiscal conservatism.\n\nSaenz spokeswoman Xochitl Mora Garcia said the mayor\u2019s office is trying to coordinate a tour of the port with Trump as he will now have more time to spare in Laredo, to give Trump \u201ca different perspective of life on the border\u201d.\n\nTrump may have Chris Christie-esque qualities out on the campaign trail. He ran for president twice and lost both times.
