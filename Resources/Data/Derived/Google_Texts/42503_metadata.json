I always seem to find a way to second place out of a potential victory.\u201d\n\nOn Friday night at the Reggie Lewis Center, Loxsom stopped by to hand out medals at the New England Indoor Championships, the high school meet where he set a meet record in 2009 in winning a title for Wilbur Cross High School of New Haven, Conn.\n\n\u201cFive or six years ago, that was me here doing that,\u201d Loxsom said.\n\nIn the women\u2019s pole vault, NCAA indoor record-holder Demi Payne, a rising star from Stephen F. Austin, overcame a shaky warmup to win at 14 feet, 11 inches, defeating defending champion Mary Saxer. Jenn Suhr, the 2012 Olympic champion and world indoor record-holder who came into the competition with a heel injury, withdrew after failing to make her first two attempts.\n\n\u201cIt was pretty intimidating,\u201d Payne said. \u201cThey\u2019re the best of the best. I knew it was going to be a dogfight.\u201d Saxer finished second, jumping 14-9.\n\nThe mother of an 18-month-old, Payne, whose NCAA record of 15-7 makes her the third-best American woman indoors in history, said she has her sights set on making the U.S. team for the World Championships this summer in Beijing.\n\nShannon Rowbury won her second title in the meet, taking the two mile in 9:43.94. She won the mile Saturday.\n\nAlysia Montano, who was safely out front when main rival Ajee Wilson crashed to the track after being tripped midway through the race, won the women\u2019s 600 in 1:26.59. It was her first major competition since giving both to her first child in August.\n\n\u201cI was hoping it would be Ajee and I going at it,\u201d Montano said. \u201cIt was disappointing to hear the crash.\u201d\n\nMichelle Carter won her third consecutive indoor title in the shot put with a mark of 63-9 3/4, the longest in the world this year.\n\nChaunte Lowe, the 2012 world indoor champion in the high jump, won her third U.S. indoor title as well, jumping 6-2 to beat 39-year-old Amy Acuff, who is beginning a comeback in a quest for make her sixth Olympic team in 2016. Acuff jumped 5-11 1/2 to take second.\n\nIn the 60, Marvin Bracy and Tianna Bartoletta successfully defended their titles. Bracy, the 2014 world indoor silver medalist, won in 6.55, while Bartoletta, the 2014 world indoor bronze medalist and 2005 world champion in the long jump, finished in 7.08.\n\nMatthew Centrowitz capped a successful indoor campaign with a victory in the men\u2019s mile in 4:01.40, and Lauren Wallace had an upset win in the women\u2019s 1,000, securing the first major victory in her career in a meet-record 2:40.42.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s unreal,\u201d said Wallace, a 26-year-old 800 specialist. \u201cIt hasn\u2019t set in yet. The coolest part was running through the tape. I\u2019ve never been able to do that before. The tape was really, really cool.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Casimir Loxsom breaks American indoor record in 600 at USA Indoor Championships", "title": "Casimir Loxsom breaks American indoor record in 600 at USA Indoor Championships", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/03/01/casimir-loxsom-breaks-american-indoor-record-in-600-at-usa-indoor-championships/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150301__Casimir-Loxsomp1.jpg", "height": 452}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150301__Casimir-Loxsomp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-03-01T18:38:11+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-25T14:53:55+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Running"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcca40\"", "article_summary": "BOSTON \u2014 Casimir Loxsom broke his own American indoor record in the 600 meters Sunday, winning the USA Indoor Track & Field Championships in 1 minute, 15.33 seconds.\nBracy, the 2014 world indoor silver medalist, won in 6.55, while Bartoletta, the 2014 world indoor bronze medalist and 2005 world champion in the long jump, finished in 7.08.\nShannon Rowbury won her second title in the meet, taking the two mile in 9:43.94.\nJenn Suhr, the 2012 Olympic champion and world indoor record-holder who came into the competition with a heel injury, withdrew after failing to make her first two attempts.\n\u201cIt was disappointing to hear the crash.\u201dMichelle Carter won her third consecutive indoor title in the shot put with a mark of 63-9 3/4, the longest in the world this year."}
