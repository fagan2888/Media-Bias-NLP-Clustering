In Iowa, where Walker has focused the bulk of his campaign strategy and resources, a Monmouth University poll this week put Walker in fifth place, with 7 percent support, behind Donald Trump, Ben Carson, Carly Fiorina, and Ted Cruz.\n\nOther national polls tell the same story. At the end of July, Walker briefly rose to second place amongst GOP candidates nationally, edging out Jeb Bush with 13.7 percent support, according to the RealClearPolitics presidential poll average. Walker is now in sixth place overall, with an average showing of 6.3 percent.\n\nWhy is Scott Walker\u2019s campaign faring so poorly?\n\nOne reason is Donald Trump, whose hip-shot populism has arguably done more damage to Walker\u2019s campaign than to any other GOP candidate.\n\nBut the other reason is Scott Walker.\n\nWalker is running a pandering, cringe-worthy campaign marked by a consistent inability to clearly articulate, and stick to, his own positions.\n\nAfter drumming up a ton of attention early in the year by giving passionate speeches about his record as governor of Wisconsin, he\u2019s been unable to sustain his early momentum. Instead, he\u2019s allowed himself to be drawn into a series of news cycle traps, and then handled the aftermath poorly, often by denying that he\u2019d made any misstep in the first place.\n\nMost recently, for example, Walker seemed to suggest that he was open to the possibility of a building a wall along the Canadian border in order to stop illegal immigration. He responded by saying that he\u2019d been asked this question by people in New Hampshire, that the people asking the questions had \"very legitimate concerns,\" and that the idea of building a wall would be \"a legitimate issue for us to look at.\"\n\nIt\u2019s not exactly a \"damn right we should build a wall!\" But Walker\u2019s response clearly takes the idea seriously, and pointedly does not rule it out.\n\nYesterday, however, he claimed that the talk about it was \"just a joke\" and that he\u2019s \"never talked about a wall at the north.\"\n\nThis is the Walker campaign playbook: Say something awkward or ill-advised, watch as the media swarms to cover it, then insist that there was never anything to see.\n\nThe same thing happened with Walker\u2019s comments on birthright citizenship. Questioned on camera by MSNBC\u2019s Kasie Hunt about whether he supported ending birthright citizenship, as Donald Trump has called for, he nodded his head and said \"yeah, absolutely, going forward.\" When Hunt pressed him further, \"We should end birthright citizenship?\" he nodded again and said, \"Yeah, to me it\u2019s about enforcing the laws in this country.\"\n\nYes, as The Daily Beast\u2019s Betsy Woodruff notes in a smart piece today, Walker appears to have a longstanding verbal tic in which he initially responds with a \"yeah\" to questions he does not mean to answer in the affirmative.\n\nBut watch the exchange with Hunt again. Walker, asked for confirmation of his initial response, responds a second time in the affirmative, nodding along as he does. It\u2019s hard to watch the back and forth and not get the distinct impression that Walker is in favor of ending birthright citizenship.\n\nA few days later, when asked about it again, he shifted course by explicitly declining to take a position. \"I'm not taking a position on it one way or the other,\" he told CNBC\u2019s John Harwood. Yet just a few more days after that, he did take a position, telling ABC\u2019s George Stephanopoulos that was definitely not in favor of ending birthright citizenship.\n\nThat\u2019s three different positions in the space of week\u2014and yet when asked about the shifts, a campaign spokes erson complained about efforts to \"mischaracterize\" his position.\n\nIt is difficult, if not impossible, to correctly characterize a candidate\u2019s position on an issue when the candidate himself cannot seem to state it with any clarity.\n\nThis sort of flip-flopping, what might generously be called policy confusion, has dogged Walker\u2019s campaign essentially from the moment it began. Back in March, Walker, in what was obviously a sop to Iowa voters, reversed his previously clear opposition to federal ethanol subsidies.\n\nA week later, when asked about the change, he denied that he had flip flopped on the issue. Since then, his position appears to have shifted again, with Walker suggesting to The Washington Examiner\u2019s Timothy Carney that he supports ending the ethanol mandate after two years.\n\nEven when Walker holds what looks to be a relatively clear position, he has a difficult time describing it. After his campaign released an imperfect but detailed-enough Obamacare replacement plan last month, he was asked about whether he can justify its redistributive effects. Politically speaking, the best answer to this entirely predictable question would have been that Walker\u2019s plan is designed first and foremost to help the broad middle class.\n\nInstead, as The Washington Post\u2019s Greg Sargent notes, Walker offered a stumbling, semi-coherent invocation of \"freedom,\" \"freedom,\" and more \"freedom,\" and insisted that redistribution simply wasn\u2019t an issue for his plan\u2014even though it is, both in the sense that it changes the relative redistribution from how it is now, and in the sense that it puts its own alternative system of redistribution into place.\n\nWalker started his run as a candidate with a record of accomplishment who would get things done in Washington. He quickly turned into a candidate who couldn't even describe what it is he'd do.\n\nAnd in the process, he lost what made his campaign take off in the first place. Walker rose to prominence earlier this year not only on the strength of his governing record, but on his ability to clearly and powerfully articulate that record and why it mattered. The natural extension of this, as a candidate, would have been to take the issues that he was already known for at the state level\u2014public sector union power, budget deficits, state spending and taxes\u2014and develop them into a coherent national agenda.\n\nInstead, Walker has pandered to Iowa voters, prioritizing issues like immigration and the nuclear deal with Iran that were never core to his appeal, and let his campaign be drawn into the day-to-day absurdities of the Trump circus.\n\nHe has not only shifted his policy positions, he has shifted his character\u2014and in doing so, he has undermined his essential appeal.\n\nCan he get his campaign back on track? He\u2019s certainly going to try: As Bloomberg Politics reports, Walker is out to reboot his campaign by, among other things, attacking rival Jeb Bush for being insufficiently opposed to the Iran deal, despite previously suggesting that he wouldn\u2019t go on the offensive against his Republican rivals. In other words, he\u2019s going to shift his character again.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "He started as a governor running on his accomplishments.
