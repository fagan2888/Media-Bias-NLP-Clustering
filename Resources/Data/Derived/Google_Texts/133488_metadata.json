Review of Books, slavery, South, Life News, Politics News\n\nThis article originally appeared on the L.A. Review of Books\n\n\n\nTO AN UNTUTORED YANKEE, Dixie Outfitters looks like a white supremacist gift shop. Crowding the walls, filling display cases, and stacked on tables are belts, mugs, buttons, signs, dog tags, mouse pads, checkbooks, wallets, rear window murals, and piles of shirts, all united in their proud display of the Confederate flag: an ideal place for racists, accidental or otherwise, to accessorize.\n\nI encountered Dixie Outfitters after moving from Chicago to take a job at James Madison University in Harrisonburg, Virginia. The store was a cartoonish confirmation of my ugliest biases against Southern culture. Here on an infant\u2019s onesie was a winged, behaloed pig, Root\u2019n for Jesus; there a bumper sticker asserted that Dixie girls have the best ASSets. Superficial faith and sincere misogyny, side by side. In Confederate gray a soldier aimed his musket at me \u2014 DAMN YANKEES! said the t-shirt caption \u2014 while behind him flew that awful emblem of slavery and segregation. Worst of all, I thought, the entire operation was allowed to feign normalcy in a local mall, across from Radio Shack and next to Claire\u2019s Boutique.\n\nHad no one complained?\n\nWas all this a significant part of the modern South, my new home?\n\nIt seemed entirely possible. Virginia is crisscrossed by roads named in honor of Confederate generals. Schools, too, are named for them, and rebels are a common mascot. Cities are littered with Confederate monuments, which this Yankee first took for the shining bones of a long-dead ideology. But dead it is not, and I soon learned that the holiness of its martyrs lives on in the land they once defended.\n\nThe clerk on my first visit to Dixie Outfitters was a friendly middle-aged woman, whose T-shirt featured a golden retriever puppy wearing a Confederate flag bandanna. In a raspy voice, clearly ravaged by cigarettes, she told me I was in one of 10 independently owned and operated franchises located across the southern United States. The co-owner of this franchise was her best friend, who for years sold Dixie Outfitters merchandise at regional festivals before opening up a permanent location in the mall.\n\nAs I looked through a catalog of available designs, contemplating an ironic purchase, a mother and her daughter walked in and began to browse in earnest. The girl was no older than eight or nine, and neither of them struck me as the kind of people who would seek out offensive clothing. But there they were, the mother smiling as her young daughter held up a shirt printed with an adorable little cowgirl, dressed in a leather-fringed skirt and jacket, holding a small Confederate flag. The scene was intensely disturbing: a Southern woman encouraging nostalgia for a time when children like her daughter could be bought and sold, provided they were black.\n\nTurning back to the catalog I discovered a design that incorporated five black men: four painted soldiers in the background, and, in the foreground, what appeared to be a contemporary photograph of a bearded older man, flagpole resting in the crook of his elbow, gazing proudly into the distance. A gold seal read \u201cBlack Confederates, the History of the South,\u201d and on the man\u2019s shirt was printed the name H. K. Edgerton.\n\nThe Edgerton shirt was part of a series dedicated to revealing suppressed truths about the Civil War, including one with a dour-looking Lincoln next to the following supposed quote:\n\nWe didn\u2019t go to war to put down slavery, but to put the flag back, and to act differently at this moment would, I have no doubt, not only weaken our cause but smack of bad faith.\n\nIn the end I decided against a shirt and purchased a flag-emblazoned drink cozy that read \u201cIf this flag offends you, you need a history lesson.\u201d Well, it did offend me, and I struggled to grasp how anything other than racist ignorance was at work. This struggle led to countless hours of research and interviews, eventually landing me in the tiny town of Odum, Georgia, where I would speak with Dewey Barber himself, founder and CEO of Dixie Outfitters, in an effort to understand the people that buy his products and wear them with pride.\n\n\u00a4\n\nIf you type \u201cblack confederates\u201d into Google, one of the hits is a Washington Post article detailing a Virginia textbook scandal. In 2010, the same year that governor Bob McDonnell declared April Confederate History Month, William & Mary Civil War historian Carol Sheriff read an astonishing claim in her daughter\u2019s fourth-grade textbook: \u201cThousands of Southern blacks fought in the Confederate ranks, including two black battalions under the command of Stonewall Jackson.\u201d\n\nSheriff complained, and the resulting investigation revealed that the textbook\u2019s author, Joy Masoff, had relied primarily on the internet for her information, in this case Southern heritage websites with a vested interest in exonerating the Confederacy from charges of racism. But no one at the publisher checked her sources, and just like that, partisan propaganda passed as historical fact.\n\n\u201cPeople don\u2019t believe in the black Confederate narrative because they\u2019re crazy,\u201d explains historian Kevin Levin. \u201cThey believe it because they read it. It\u2019s on a website that looks professional, has all the bells and whistles, and includes images, primary sources of all kinds. How could it not be true?\u201d\n\nLevin\u2019s long-running blog, Civil War Memory, is on the front lines in a battle between established historians and a vocal minority who insist that most academics are biased liberals bent on slandering the South. Dixie Outfitters is a part of this minority, and its company website includes a history section with over eighty links to information about black Confederates.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to dismiss such history as disingenuous propaganda, and in certain cases that\u2019s exactly what it is. One widely distributed photograph captioned \u201c1st Louisiana Native Guard\u201d was claimed by its online retailer to depict members of the first all-black Confederate unit. In fact, the image was created by altering a studio photograph of black Union soldiers.\n\nThe problem, however, is that not every photograph is a forgery, not every quote is invented (the previous Lincoln quote is authentic), and even with a great deal of training it is difficult to determine what counts as trustworthy analysis of ambiguous historical evidence, and what is motivated deception, especially when it involves a topic so ideologically charged as the Civil War.\n\nFor instance, take this passage from an essay by cultural studies scholar Leslie Madsen-Brooks: \u201c[I]t appears no academic historians have subscribed to the narrative that there were thousands of black Confederate soldiers.\u201d\n\nWhen I first read it, Madsen-Brooks\u2019s claim confirmed the results of my own research. But then I discovered that Harvard historian John Stauffer gave a 2011 talk at the W. E. B. Du Bois Institute in which he claimed that between 3,000 and 10,000 black soldiers fought for the Confederacy.\n\nWhat to believe? Kevin Levin had attended the Harvard lecture and blogged about his objections on Civil War Memory, but Levin is a high school teacher, and Stauffer is a Harvard professor. Madsen-Brooks does not specialize in the Civil War; Stauffer does.\n\nAfter additional research I settled on my own answer to the question of black Confederates. I believe Levin is more reliable than Stauffer, and I assume there were very few, if any, black Confederate soldiers. Even if they did exist in larger numbers, it would speak only to the complexity of human motivation, not the inclusivity of Confederate ideology.\n\nBut for the purposes of assessing Dixie Outfitters and its clientele, the real question is whether reasonable laypeople could disagree about issues such as black Confederates, the meaning of the Confederate flag, and the causes of the Civil War \u2014 and whether they could disagree even after doing substantial research. The answer to that question is yes, which means my initial impression of Dixie Outfitters might have been misguided, the product of a Yankee mind eager to connect the Confederate flag with ignorant racists, when for some it actually represents sincere belief in an alternative history and a sign of defiance against people like me.\n\n\u00a4\n\nBefore driving to Dixie Outfitters\u2019s headquarters in Odum, Georgia, I spend a night in Savannah, General Sherman\u2019s Christmas gift to Lincoln in 1864. It\u2019s been less than a month since the Paula Deen debacle, and I drop by her restaurant, The Lady and Sons, expecting a live version of a New York Times photograph that ran with their coverage of Deen: overweight white people lining up to support a fallen icon of culinary excess and racism.\n\nThere is no line. A black hostess stands outside and greets a party of three young women, one of whom is also black. It\u2019s as if the city of Savannah has decided to do what the rest of the nation couldn\u2019t: forgive Deen for her sins and move on. While dining at Zunzi\u2019s 2, a South African restaurant, I talk to the bartender about local reactions to Deen\u2019s fall from grace.\n\n\u201cI think most people just don\u2019t care that much,\u201d he says. \u201cWe worry about tourism. For people like me, for liberals in Savannah, there\u2019s bigger problems to think about. Worse people out there.\u201d\n\nI ask if those people tend to carry Confederate flags.\n\n\u201cMaybe,\u201d he says,\n\nBut I had lots of friends in college with the flag in their rooms. They didn\u2019t think about it too much, just thought it was cool or Southern or whatever. I mean, when I was there, Mississippi\u2019s mascot was Colonel Reb. Doesn\u2019t mean all the football fans were racist.\n\nHe pauses to pour a drink before turning back to me.\n\n\u201cSee, the real bad guys aren\u2019t so obvious. They wear red ties and flag pins on their lapels.\u201d\n\nThe next morning I set out for Odum. Like many Southern thoroughfares, the road from Savannah to Odum is lined with pine trees and poverty. Swaths of forest are punctuated by rundown trailer parks, vacant lots, and endless hand-painted placards advertising land for sale, as if the countryside is still recovering from the economic devastation wrought by Sherman\u2019s March to the Sea. Occasionally there\u2019s a barren field of stumps, a sign that some lucky landowner managed to sell his trees to a Georgia pulp mill, just like the mill that employed Dewey Barber for 13 years before he quit to try his luck in the silk-screen T-shirt business.\n\nI meet the 65-year-old Barber in the lobby of his headquarters, a 25,000-square-foot gray building with \u201cBarber and Company\u201d printed on the fa\u00e7ade. He\u2019s dressed in shorts and a faded Dixie Outfitters T-shirt, an outfit that\u2019s incongruous given his immaculate handlebar moustache and neatly parted hair.\n\nAfter a tour of the factory floor we sit down in Barber\u2019s office, which is decorated with a combination of Confederate memorabilia and family photos. Behind his desk hang three framed prints: First Battle Flags, which depicts the First Army of Northern Virginia; La Belle Rebelle, a portrait of famed Confederate spy Maria \u201cBelle\u201d Boyd; and a painting of Stonewall Jackson\u2019s funeral. In an alcove to my left is a bust of General Nathan Bedford Forrest, an early member of the Klan, which stands next to a photograph of a Little League team. Barber\u2019s son Wesley, a massive bodybuilder, has his own desk in the corner where he works on new designs while downing weight-gain shakes.\n\nThe oldest of five children, Dewey Barber was born in 1947, in Acme, North Carolina. Both of his parents worked in factories, his mother as a seamstress and his father shoveling sulfur in a fertilizer plant. Determined to escape poverty, Barber saved up 2,000 dollars working in grocery stores and tobacco fields, enough to cover costs when he enrolled at North Carolina State, the first in his family to attend college. Somewhat ruefully he admits that he chose his major by looking at the starting salaries of NCS graduates \u2014 the major with the highest average salary was chemical engineering, and that was that.\n\n\u201cAfter college I ended up at the pulp mill,\u201d Barber says in a charming drawl, referring to a steam-belching monstrosity the size of Odum that I\u2019d passed on the road from Savannah. \u201cI was a process engineer there for 13 years. The money was good but it was kind of unfulfilling. I felt like I was wasting my life.\u201d\n\nPresented with an opportunity to get into silk-screening, Barber quit his job, mortgaged his house, and invested the money in printing equipment and a building. At first business was slow, a hodgepodge of jobs for local churches and sports teams. But then he discovered transfers. Unlike printed T-shirts, which require an initial investment of four to five dollars, transfer papers cost only 15 cents to make, which allows for high-volume production without too much up-front capital. Through a local connection, Barber began supplying transfer papers to the Myrtle Beach tourist industry, and his profit margins soared.\n\nBut despite his newfound success, Barber\u2019s heart wasn\u2019t in Myrtle Beach. It was in the South.\n\n\u201cOne day, suddenly it hit me,\u201d says Barber.\n\nThis was in 1997. All around, I could see the Confederate flag was being used in a warped way, a convoluted way. It was not used in the context that all of us in the South, normal people, really think of it. For us it\u2019s an icon for the way we live. So I came up with the idea of putting it with images that portrayed that. The first Dixie Outfitters shirt, it was just a deer, jumping out of an oval, and in the background was a Confederate flag. I made another with a bass, and I gave the shirts to some friends of mine who were doing a festival.\n\nThe shirts took off. Mall kiosks, festival vendors, tourist shops, everyone was clamoring for designs that incorporated the battle flag. Dixie Outfitters\u2019s first franchise opened in Tifton, Georgia, in 2006, and nine more followed, including the one in Harrisonburg.\n\nI ask Barber why he thinks the line was so successful.\n\nIt appeals to a community of people that are like thinkers. We share the same feelings of injustice that\u2019s been perpetrated on the Southern people. The South\u2019s always been a unique area. The culture that the Yankees destroyed was a genteel culture. The ladies had the big hats, the gentlemen were gentlemen. It\u2019s about being gentlemen and ladylike.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Yankee tries very hard to understand the South's lingering fixation with the Confederacy", "title": "Dixie Outfitters is still fighting the Civil War", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "A Yankee tries very hard to understand the South's lingering fixation with the Confederacy", "title": "Dixie Outfitters is still fighting the Civil War", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2013/09/11/dixie_outfitters_is_still_fighting_the_civil_war/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/09/civil_war_reenactment.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A Yankee tries very hard to understand the South's lingering fixation with the Confederacy", "title": "Dixie Outfitters is still fighting the Civil War", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/09/civil_war_reenactment.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Alan Levinovitz", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Civil War, Confederacy, confederate flag, L.A.
