The Life365 \u201cRain\u201d platform uses light-touch hardware, software and services to keep patients engaged with their health, assist in adherence to prescribed health regimens, and integrate individual health data into electronic medical records.\n\nLife365\u2019s objective is to build on the demonstrated efficacy of remote-patient monitoring with cost effective, scalable and adoptable solutions to reach a greater number of patients. This health monitoring solution will enable business models of payors, providers, Accountable Care Organizations and other entities financially responsible for patient populations.\n\nLife365 was recently selected by BioAccel to receive early-stage funding, including office space at BioInspire\u2019s 7,000-square-foot facility in Peoria.\n\nLife365 president Dicks is an Arizona native, and a graduate of Arizona State University. This is his third company.\n\nHis first company, MEDAPPS, 2006, folded 2012 into a large company, ALERE, a $3 billion company.\n\n\u201cThey were using technology to connect patients in their home, automatically sent to a server, where a doctor could look at it anytime,\u201d Dicks said. \u201cSo, if you left the hospital, the patient would step on a scale in the morning and send results to a caseworker.\n\n\u201cWe connect through cell phones to the Internet, take readings, blood pressure, weight, (all) connected to a doctor.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a whole new phenomena working: keep patients out of the hospital, monitored at home. We were quite successful.\u201d\n\nNow, Dicks is creating a new company, which is working on what he said is \u201cbasically a wearable, on the wrist, and helps with vital signs, assists with medication compliance, makes sure you take your medicine today, and helps people with chronic conditions stay connected with family members to make sure mom or dad is OK at home. Anybody authorized to receive the information can detect what is going on.\u201d\n\nDicks said, \u201cIn the case of my mom and dad, they live in Iowa, I\u2019m in Arizona. They\u2019re in a new house, want to stay connected. So, they would have this device. We can be instrumental in helping with their care.\u201d\n\nLife 365 comes with a big bonus, Dicks said.\n\nLife365 can be very useful for veterans, seniors and the uninsured population. Dicks said there is a major emphasis on veterans.\n\n\u201cI did testify in Washington several years ago about veterans affairs and rural (populations),\u201d Dicks said. \u201cVeterans tend to not return because they\u2019re not connected to a doctor.\n\n\u201cWith this, we\u2019re hoping to be able to take glucose readings on a regular basis, medicine on a regular basis.\u201d\n\nThe challenge: healthcare resources.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to optimize the care and better quality of life, reduce costs. It allows for better outcomes in a more cost-effective solution,\u201d Dicks said. \u201cPart of the reason why we developed the band, 20 percent of the population contributes 80 percent of health care costs. It is in our best interest as a country to find new, innovative care for people and try to make the experience better for them in a home setting.\u201d\n\nIt will be three years before the first product enters the market, Dicks said, and two months before a prototype will be ready. Then six months after that, it will be generally available.\n\nThe cost? Optimizing to around $99, Dicks said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a great price,\u201d Dicks said. \u201cA prescription model over the counter. It\u2019s more important to get the healthcare out there. It\u2019s a band that\u2019s economical, download apps from the Cloud. We\u2019ve made it so it connects from WiFi directly. In assisted living, we can talk to hundreds of bands over a network.\n\n\u201cWe made it for the senior generation, but you don\u2019t have to have a Smartphone or computer to use it. You can connect it directly to a Smart TV. We want to make it really simple.\u201d\n\nBecause he is an Arizona native, Dicks is concentrating on Arizona, where he said there is a big need among seniors and indigent.\n\n\u201cI contacted MaryAnn Guerra, BioAccel, and she said we would be a great candidate for BioInspire,\u201d Dicks said. \u201cI thought it was an incredible opportunity. There are a lot of great resources in Peoria, and Arizona. Peoria has tech resources. I don\u2019t have to travel around the world to attract people to work with our company. Everybody\u2019s here in Arizona, and Peoria in particular.\u201d\n\nThe Life365 office is already in Peoria.\n\n\u201cI am more excited about 365 than ever before,\u201d Dicks said. \u201cDo more with less. Affordable Care Act, and reimbursement, electronic health records - all in place. What is needed is the next step, lightweight technology to connect with their doctor on a regular basis. I think it\u2019s an incredibly exciting time in healthcare.\u201d\n\n\u201cBioAccel is excited to partner with Life365,\u201d said MaryAnn Guerra, BioAccel CEO. \u201cBioAccel believes that use of digital, wearable and mobile health innovations has the potential to transform social conditions, systems processes, access to care, desired health impact and outcomes. Life365, with its integrated platform, allows us to enter the rapidly growing wearable sensor space and enables synergistic opportunities for other vanguard technologies included in BioAccel\u2019s portfolio.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "Peoriatimes.com", "description": "BioAccel, with laboratory and business facilities at BioInspire, announced last week a new venture development program partnership with Life365.", "title": "Life365 newest venture at BioAccel", "url": "http://www.peoriatimes.com/news/article_b766c63c-fc41-11e5-a88f-9b8d23125440.html", "image": {"width": 400, "identifier": "http://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/peoriatimes.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/1/f6/1f6b42f8-fc42-11e5-8b70-5bf498a9c3e0/570585c03b930.image.jpg?resize=400%2C630", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@tweetmeme", "card": "summary"}, "description": "BioAccel, with laboratory and business facilities at BioInspire, announced last week a new venture development program partnership with Life365.", "fb": {"app_id": 150159381662876}, "keywords": "news,headlines", "news_keywords": "news,headlines"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe41f6\"", "article_summary": "BioAccel, with laboratory and business facilities at BioInspire, announced last week a new venture development program partnership with Life365.\nLife365 was recently selected by BioAccel to receive early-stage funding, including office space at BioInspire\u2019s 7,000-square-foot facility in Peoria.\nI think it\u2019s an incredibly exciting time in healthcare.\u201d\u201cBioAccel is excited to partner with Life365,\u201d said MaryAnn Guerra, BioAccel CEO.\n\u201cPart of the reason why we developed the band, 20 percent of the population contributes 80 percent of health care costs.\nLife365 is a new venture founded by Arizona native and entrepreneur Kent Dicks."}
