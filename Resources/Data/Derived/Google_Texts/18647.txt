Donna DiTrani and Kerry Wilks are a same-sex couple living in Wichita, but after years of being together, they still cannot get married.

The U.S. Supreme Court said it was no longer hearing appeals from states trying to ban same-sex marriage. Many couple in Kansas thought that meant they could legally marry but the state is still not allowing same-sex marriages.

The American Civil Liberties Union has filed a lawsuit challenging the states same-sex marriage ban and listed Donna DiTrani and Kerry Wilks on the suit

"A lot of support, people are coming to us today and telling us we are doing a good thing," DiTrani said.

For a short period of time, Johnson County was allowing same-sex marriages but Attorney General Derek Schmidt filed a petition with the Kansas Supreme Court to stop the issuing. The court did block the marriage licenses from being issued and set a hearing on the issue for November 6th.

Wilks and DiTrani have the option to get a marriage license in a state that allows same-sex marriages, but they feel it is important to do it in Kansas, a place where they call home.

"I have a church, they are waiting to marry us, many other people are waiting to get married in that church, let us get married," said Wilks, "it is the right thing to do."

A court date has not been set for the lawsuit filed by the ACLU.
