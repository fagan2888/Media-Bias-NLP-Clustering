They\u2019re so tired of stupidity.\u201d\n\nThe candidate for the GOP presidential nomination shifted briskly from one topic to another, taking about 10 minutes of his speech to attack \"corrupt\" media there to cover him. No recent polls of Mississippi Republican voters, who have their primary March 8, have been taken, but RealClearPolitics shows averages of national polls taken before the holidays give Trump a more than 15-percentage-point spread over the next most popular politician, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz.\n\nTrump regularly has expressed opposition to Syrian refugees settling in the United States, and the Mississippi rally was no exception.\n\n\u201cWe have no idea who they are and where they come from,\u201d he said. \u201cI think maybe it is the ultimate Trojan horse.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s appearance in Biloxi followed reports that Al Shabaab, a Somali al-Qaeda affiliate, issued a recruitment video with a clip of Trump speaking after the Dec. 2 shooting in San Bernadino, Calif. The video includes Trump\u2019s statements in support of banning Muslims from entering the United States.\n\nHis position has drawn criticism from Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton, who said before the video\u2019s release that the Islamic State was using his statements in propaganda videos.\n\nTrump took a milder approach than he has in the past, making no mention of the videos, the Islamic faith or Muslims when discussing the Islamic State and Middle East. He simultaneously was critical of the Iraq War and advocated for enlarging the country\u2019s military.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to build our military so strong, so powerful,\" he said. \"We\u2019ll never have to use it hopefully,\u201d which transitioned into, \u201cI\u2019m someone who believes in the military, but you\u2019ve got to know how to use it.\u201d\n\nHe touched on plans announced Tuesday to begin spending millions on television advertising in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina \u2014 the first three states that will make their choices for GOP nominee known. Thus far, he has spent $300,000 compared to former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, who has spent more than $40 million.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to start spending quite a lot of money because I want to be sure,\u201d Trump said. \u201cUntil now I\u2019ve loved it because I\u2019ve spent less than anyone else and had the best results. That\u2019s what should happen with our country.\u201d\n\nAt one point, Trump interrupted his unscripted stump speech to criticize videographers at the event for not panning their cameras to show the crowd.\n\n\u201cSpin the camera,\u201d he told one, and at one point he said, \u201cThey\u2019re really dishonest people. I might fire his a-- right now.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe people are really smart,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThey get it. They know how crooked the system is. They know how crooked these reporters are, many of them.\u201d\n\nTrump did not make himself available for questions before or after the event and is scheduled for five events in five states through Saturday. Only appearances in Claremont, N.H., and Clear Lake, Iowa, appear to be in smaller-than-coliseum venues.\n\nTrump also attacked his rivals, particularly Clinton.\n\n\u201cEveryone knows she should be in jail,\u201d he said, bringing up her decision while working for the State Department to use a private email account and server. \u201cWhat she did with the emails was a disgrace. She shouldn\u2019t be allowed to run.\u201d\n\nTrump mentioned goals to get rid of both the Affordable Care Act and Common Core education standards and returned to his plans to build a wall between the United States and Mexico \u2014 even bigger than the Great Wall of China.\n\n\u201cThis will be a real wall,\u201d he said. \u201cLet people come into the country, but they\u2019re coming into the country legally.\u201d\n\nTrump has been described as a polarizing figure, but the same positions that have drawn criticism have attracted admirers, who say they support his tell-it-like-it-is attitude.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not trying to be politically correct,\u201d said Kathy Rogers of Hattiesburg, Miss. \u201cHe brings up issues and what he believes in and doesn\u2019t care about what anyone else says.\u201d\n\nHjalmberi Shytox of Purvis, Miss., also favors Trump\u2019s lack of political correctness.\n\n\u201cThe state is more or less dead,\u201d he said. \u201cI see Trump as a way to get back to where we were. \u2026 I believe in my heart if Hillary Clinton is elected, we might as well put a tombstone on this country.\u201d\n\nTrump is the second presidential candidate to campaign in Mississippi this election season after Ohio Gov. John Kasich\u2019s visit last year.\n\nFollow Mollie Bryant on Twitter: @MollieEBryant", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "<p><img assetid=\"78226334\" assettype=\"image\" credit=\"Rogelio V.
