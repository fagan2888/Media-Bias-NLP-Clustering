Chen, who spent a chunk of his career on Wall Street before turning to academia, says 2014 was the year that the economy finally returned to some semblance of reasonable growth levels - although seeing might not yet be believing for some. \u201cOur economy is actually doing alright,\u201d he said, although \u201cthis is hard to stomach for a lot of us, because we\u2019ve really been through a lot.\u201d\n\nWhat might finally convince us \u2014 the amazing story of oil prices, which was the headline bringing 2014 to a close. \u201cI don\u2019t know about you,\u201d said Chen, \u201cbut I really feel extremely fortunate that every time I go fill up at the pump I feel like I\u2019ve got an extra ten spot in my pocket.\u201d That new feeling of well-being drove extra luxury shopping this holiday season, and will return consumers as a meaningful engine of economic growth in 2015, he says.\n\nThe other big trend he sees continuing into this year is data. So much data, in fact, there\u2019s a new term for what we\u2019re suffering from: \u201cinfobesity.\u201d The data glut will sort companies into those that can cope and take advantage, and those that can\u2019t. \u201cWe now have the tools that enable us not only to collect that data,\u201d said Chen, \u201cbut also analyze that data, and give us the means, the tools that we need in order to make decisions based on that kind of data.\u201d\n\nOur second expert is a man who\u2019s stepping into a new job with the new year - Joe Brennan, the new CEO of the Connecticut Business and Industry Association. His first prediction is business as usual. \u201cWell, the person leading the organization may change, but the mission does not,\u201d he told the Business Report. That mission is moving Connecticut up in the rankings of competitive states, the central plank of CBIA\u2019s 20x17 campaign, which was launched in 2014. Brennan says the needle has certainly moved in 2014 on national economic recovery, but the jury may still be out in the Nutmeg state. \u201cOur concern is always, as the national economy recovers, does Connecticut participate in that recovery or do we lag?\u201d said Brennan.\n\nThe fall\u2019s jobs numbers were encouraging, and he\u2019ll be looking for that trend to continue. But sometimes state government still seems to be standing in the way. \u201cThe recent decision by Tenet Healthcare to pull out of Connecticut, I think was very emblematic of what hurts Connecticut, that we make things difficult,\u201d he said.\n\nOn his wishllist for 2015 - a lean state budget and more efficiencies in government - although he recognizes the need to spend on the right priorities. \u201cIt\u2019s always a fine line because we know we need investments in education, we need investments in transportation infrastructure, we need certain investments in housing and other critical areas, but if we do it in ways that\u2019s going to make Connecticut look less favorable to investors to put their dollars in the ground here and create jobs here, that\u2019s a problem.\u201d\n\nFor the last of our turn-of-the-year perspecctives, we checked in with Connecticut\u2019s entrepreneurs, courtesy of a man who\u2019s met a lot of them this year - Eric Knight. \u201cIn the calendar year, in 2014,\u201d said Knight, \u201cI helped 120 different little businesses, companies, sole proprietorships, inventors take those next steps.\u201d\n\nKnight is an inventor, owner of the company Remarkable Technologies, and an entrepreneur in residence at CTNext, the state\u2019s startup ecosystem. He spends two days a week helping fledgling businesses find their direction. \u201cWhat you want to be able to do, is evaluate an idea, size it up quickly and then provide the support to move it forward. Or if an idea is not sound, you want it to fail very quickly,\u201d he said.\n\nThis type of mentoring, along with other support services is common in places like Silicon Valley and Cambridge, Massachusetts, which is why they birth so many successful companies. \u201cFor some reason Connecticut is about one step behind. We\u2019re catching up very quickly, but we need a system to catalyze that connectivity,\u201d according to Knight.\n\nFor him, 2014, the second year of CTNext has seen some encouraging expansion and coordination of the support services available to entrepreneurs, and he\u2019s excited for next year. \u201cWe\u2019re starting to put together systems, locations, community, and bringing this all together so that\u2019s why I\u2019m very optimistic for 2015.\u201d\n\nWhatever expectations you have for 2015, WNPR\u2019s Business Report wishes you a Happy New Year.\n\nHear Eric Chen's predictions\n\nHear Joe Brennan's year-end thoughts", "article_metadata": {"category": "Business", "description": "WNPR\u2019s Business Desk has a tradition at this time of year of asking our contributors from around the state to reflect on the year just past, and make a few", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://wnpr.org/post/some-2015-predictions-connecticuts-business-community", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/wnpr/files/styles/medium/public/201501/Vuurwerk_in_New_York.JPG", "type": "article", "description": "WNPR\u2019s Business Desk has a tradition at this time of year of asking our contributors from around the state to reflect on the year just past, and make a few", "title": "Some 2015 Predictions from Connecticut's Business Community"}, "story_id": 374455302, "twitter": {"site": "@wnpr", "card": "summary", "creator": "@wnpr"}, "author": "Harriet Jones", "org_id": 0, "dc": {"title": "Some 2015 Predictions from Connecticut&#039;s Business Community"}, "nid": 33748, "datePublished": "2015-01-01", "keywords": "economy, industry, work, The Daily", "wordCount": 842, "has_audio": 1, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "Our series began with Eric Chen, associate professor of business administration at the University of St Joseph in West Hartford.\n\u201cWe\u2019re starting to put together systems, locations, community, and bringing this all together so that\u2019s why I\u2019m very optimistic for 2015.\u201dWhatever expectations you have for 2015, WNPR\u2019s Business Report wishes you a Happy New Year.\n\u201cWell, the person leading the organization may change, but the mission does not,\u201d he told the Business Report.\nOn his wishllist for 2015 - a lean state budget and more efficiencies in government - although he recognizes the need to spend on the right priorities.\nWNPR\u2019s Business Desk has a tradition at this time of year of asking our contributors from around the state to reflect on the year just past, and make a few predictions for the future."}
