As McDonald's and Burger King worked hard to expand their dollar menus and develop newer, cheaper snacks, Chipotle has moved in the other direction, incurring higher costs as it shifts to more expensive ingredients like cooking oils made from non-genetically-modified seeds.\n\nThe move away from genetically-modified ingredients is in line with the chain\u2019s general product focus. It likes to promote its more selective choice of ingredients \u2014 hormone-free meat, organic vegetables, local suppliers \u2014 as a way to convince customers to pay often north of $6 for a burrito.\n\nThe latest move to shift away from genetically-modified ingredients means costs will keep going up \u2014 the company is starting with oil but says it wants to eventually move all its produce in that direction. And it plans to pass on the higher costs to consumers via a price rise some time around mid-2014, potentially in tandem with a promotional campaign announcing it is the first big restaurant chain to drop all genetically-modified ingredients from its menu.\n\nHere\u2019s Chipotle\u2019s Chief Financial Officer John Hartung, answering a question about the planned price rise on an earnings call yesterday:\n\nWe\u2019re not going to make a decision today on pricing, but I think that it\u2019s probably in kind of a mid-single-digit range, whether that\u2019s 3, 4, 5 kind of percent. What it will depend on is what happens with general ingredient inflation between now and then, and then what it costs us to remove GMOs from the rest of our ingredients. So once we have all that information at hand, we\u2019ll be able to do a better job of figuring out what that price increase might be.\n\nThe company might also time the price rise to happen alongside a promotional push, Mr. Hartung said:\n\nAnd in terms of timing, it\u2019s really hinging more on removing GMOs. We\u2019d really like to make more progress, understand what that\u2019s going to cost, how much time that\u2019s going to take, all that kind of stuff. And then we\u2019ll feel better about coordinating a price increase around the time that we\u2019re removing GMOs. And we think that there might be a PR opportunity as well. We think it will be a pretty exciting time for us when we can announce that. We\u2019re not aware of any other restaurant company anywhere near our size that\u2019s even attempting to do this. And so to actually accomplish it will be pretty exciting, and we\u2019d like to time \u2014 tie that excitement around with the price increase.\n\nWill rising prices dent the company\u2019s growth trajectory? Chipotle has long targeted eaters willing to pay a premium for food they consider to be a cut above regular fast food, and despite many restaurant operators warning of tough economic conditions in recent quarters, its sales have been rising. Same-store sales increased 6.2% in the most recent quarter compared to the year prior, with company-wide revenue up 18%. Profit was up 15%.\n\nInvestors certainly liked what the company had to say in its earnings announced after the market closed on Thursday: Chipotle stock is up 16% so far on Friday.\n\nSee also:\n\nChipotle Profit Jumps 15% as Restaurant Traffic Rises \u2013 WSJ", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "While plenty in the restaurant industry are bemoaning the tough economy, Chipotle is planning to make its ingredients even more selective, and raise menu prices to pay for it", "title": "Coming Up in 2014: An Organically-Grown Price Rise at Chipotle", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/corporate-intelligence/2013/10/18/coming-up-in-2014-an-organically-grown-price-rise-at-chipotle/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/MK-CH109_ORCHID_G_20131016185242.jpg"}, "site": "WSJ", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Business", "article.headline": "Coming Up in 2014: An Organically-Grown Price Rise at Chipotle", "description": "While plenty in the restaurant industry are bemoaning the tough economy, Chipotle is planning to make its ingredients even more selective, and raise menu prices to pay for it", "article_section": "Business", "author": "Tom Gara", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "Corporate Intelligence Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "Corporate Intelligence", "article.summary": "While plenty in the restaurant industry are bemoaning the tough economy, Chipotle is planning to make its ingredients even more selective, and raise menu prices to pay for it", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2013-10-18T21:04:32-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-140", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/corporate-intelligence/2013/10/18/coming-up-in-2014-an-organically-grown-price-rise-at-chipotle/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-234B-2665", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Business", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "While plenty in the restaurant industry are bemoaning the tough economy, Chipotle is planning to make its ingredients even more selective, and raise menu prices to pay for it", "title": "Coming Up in 2014: An Organically-Grown Price Rise at Chipotle", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/corporate-intelligence/2013/10/18/coming-up-in-2014-an-organically-grown-price-rise-at-chipotle/", "image": {"width": 553, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/MK-CH109_ORCHID_G_20131016185242.jpg", "height": 369}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Corporate Intelligence", "article.id": "BL-234B-2665", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2013-10-18T21:05:58-04:00"}, "article_summary": "We\u2019d really like to make more progress, understand what that\u2019s going to cost, how much time that\u2019s going to take, all that kind of stuff.\nThe company might also time the price rise to happen alongside a promotional push, Mr. Hartung said:And in terms of timing, it\u2019s really hinging more on removing GMOs.\nWe\u2019re not aware of any other restaurant company anywhere near our size that\u2019s even attempting to do this.\nAnd then we\u2019ll feel better about coordinating a price increase around the time that we\u2019re removing GMOs.\nAnd so to actually accomplish it will be pretty exciting, and we\u2019d like to time \u2014 tie that excitement around with the price increase."}
