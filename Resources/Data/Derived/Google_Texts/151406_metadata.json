Jeb Bush once seemed a natural to navigate the political minefields of the immigration issue, given his marriage to a Mexican-born American, his vast experience in Central America and his fluency in Spanish.\n\nIt hasn\u2019t played out that way. Ever since he began positioning himself for a bid for the Republican presidential nomination, Bush has stumbled over his positions and rhetoric, including whether he would support a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants. He went from \u201cno\u201d on that issue to \u201cmaybe\u201d to \u201cno\u201d again.\n\nRelated: Why Jeb Bush\u2019s Pragmatic Immigration Plan Has No Chance of Passing in the House\n\nNow Bush is taking it on the chin from both ends of the political spectrum \u2014 derided and belittled by Republican frontrunner Donald Trump for being a \u201clow-energy\u201d softie on immigration reform and by Democratic frontrunner Hillary Rodham Clinton for using the phrase \u201canchor babies\u201d to describe the children of illegal immigrants who are born in this country and automatically become U.S. citizens under the 14th Amendment.\n\nOn Monday, as Bush was headed for a campaign appearance in McAllen, Texas, on the border with Mexico, Trump delivered a caustic sendoff.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s great he\u2019s going to the border,\u201d Trump crowed on the program Fox and Friends, adding that \u201cI think he\u2019ll find out\u201d that illegal immigration is \u201cnot an act of love.\u201d\n\nBush famously said in April 2014 that many immigrants enter this country illegally as \u201can act of love\u201d to help their families, and not as a crime. Trump favors building a wall along the 2,000 mile U.S.-Mexico border and methodically arresting and deporting more than 11 million illegal immigrants \u2014 with the understanding that the \u201cgood ones\u201d will be let back in this country after going through proper immigration procedures.\n\nRelated: Trump\u2019s Big Reveal on Immigration Plan Is Just More Empty Words\n\nBush repeatedly bridled at Trump\u2019s comments once he got down to McAllen and attacked Trump\u2019s immigration plans as preposterously expensive and ill conceived. \u201cBuilding a wall will cost hundreds of billions of dollars,\u201d Bush said, according to a report by C-SPAN. \u201cIt\u2019s not realistic, it won\u2019t be implemented. And we need border security to be able to deal with getting this country back on track. So I\u2019m not going to get into this issue of what he said and what I said. The simple fact is that his proposal is unrealistic . . . it will violate people\u2019s civil liberties, it will create friction with our third largest trading partner [Mexico] that is not necessary, and I think he\u2019s wrong about this.\u201d\n\nAs for Trump\u2019s assertion that he was the first to make immigration an issue in the campaign, Bush suggested that \u201che might want to read my book.\u201d\n\n\u201cI welcome Mr. Trump into the debate,\u201d Bush said. \u201cThat\u2019s great. He\u2019s a serious candidate and he ought to be held to what serious candidates are held to.\u201d\n\nBush showed almost as much annoyance with Clinton and other Democrats for criticizing his use of the term \u201canchor babies.\u201d He may be regretting his use of the term in what has become a war of words among GOP candidates trying to match or one-up Trump in the debate over immigration.\n\nBush insisted that he had used the term to describe abuses of the constitutional protection, and not for advocating a repeal of the protection, as Trump and others favor.\n\n\u201cGiven my background, my life, the fact that I\u2019m immersed in the immigrant experience, this is ludicrous for the Clinton campaign and others to suggest that somehow I\u2019m using a derogatory term,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat I was talking about was the specific case of fraud being committed where there were organized efforts \u2014 and frankly it\u2019s more related to Asian people coming into our country and having children in an organized effort to take advantage of a noble concept, which is birthright citizenship.\u201d\n\nHe said he continues to support the 14th Amendment protection and that, \u201cNothing about what I said should be viewed as derogatory towards immigrants at all.\u201d\n\nRelated: 5 Reasons the Trump Immigration Plan Doesn\u2019t Pass the Reality Test\n\n\u201cThis is all about how politics plays,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd by the way I think we need to take a step back and chill out a little bit about as it relates to the political correctness and somehow you have to be scolded every time you say something. It\u2019s not fair to be taken out of context, it\u2019s the nature of politics, but I just don\u2019t think this is appropriate.\u201d\n\nPressed again by a reporter to say how he would refer to those children going forward, a peeved Bush replied: \u201cGive me the name you want me to use and I\u2019ll use it.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Former Florida Gov.", "title": "Bush Warns that Trump\u2019s \u2018Unrealistic\u2019 Wall Will Cost Hundreds of Billions", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/08/25/Bush-Warns-Trump-s-Unrealistic-Wall-Will-Cost-Hundreds-Billions", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/jeb-bush-2016_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/08/25/Bush-Warns-Trump-s-Unrealistic-Wall-Will-Cost-Hundreds-Billions", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/jeb-bush-2016_1.jpg", "creator": "@ericpianin", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Former Florida Gov.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0540\"", "article_summary": "Related: Trump\u2019s Big Reveal on Immigration Plan Is Just More Empty WordsBush repeatedly bridled at Trump\u2019s comments once he got down to McAllen and attacked Trump\u2019s immigration plans as preposterously expensive and ill conceived.\n\u201cBuilding a wall will cost hundreds of billions of dollars,\u201d Bush said, according to a report by C-SPAN.\nEver since he began positioning himself for a bid for the Republican presidential nomination, Bush has stumbled over his positions and rhetoric, including whether he would support a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants.\nJeb Bush once seemed a natural to navigate the political minefields of the immigration issue, given his marriage to a Mexican-born American, his vast experience in Central America and his fluency in Spanish.\nOn Monday, as Bush was headed for a campaign appearance in McAllen, Texas, on the border with Mexico, Trump delivered a caustic sendoff."}
