John Kasich has hailed the Obamacare Medicaid expansion as an answer to Ohio\u2019s high infant mortality rate.\n\n\u201cTens of thousands of babies have been born full term, and that represents significant progress,\u201d Kasich told attendees of the Ohio Department of Health\u2019s 2014 Ohio Infant Mortality Summit in Columbus on Thursday.\n\nHe pointed to Obamacare as a reason for this progress.\n\n\u201cWith Medicaid expansion, we\u2019ve now signed up somewhere around 176,000 potential \u2014 well, 176,000 women who would not have had health care, any kind of comprehensive health care without having done that,\u201d the Republican governor said, garnering applause.\n\nVideo of the governor\u2019s Dec. 4 speech is available courtesy of Youngstown Vindicator reporter Marc Kovac.\n\nGovernor\u2019s Office of Health Transformation communications director Aaron Crooks confirmed in an email to Ohio Watchdog that 176,000 is an estimate of the total number of Ohio women enrolled in Medicaid under the Obamacare expansion.\n\nTo bring billions in Obamacare funding to the state, Kasich expanded Medicaid to all Ohioans with income up to 138 percent of the federal poverty line in 2013. Kasich\u2019s Obamacare expansion has put 430,000 Ohioans on Medicaid this year.\n\nPregnant women with income up to 200 percent of the poverty line have been eligible for Medicaid in Ohio for years. A 2012 pamphlet for the state Healthy Start program listed \u201ccomplete pregnancy-related care before and after your baby is born,\u201d nutritional assistance and other \u201cpregnancy-related services\u201d as covered by Medicaid.\n\n\u201cThe Pregnancy Related Services program is designed to reduce the risk of preterm birth and poor pregnancy outcomes by supplementing regular obstetrical care with services such as counseling, education and care coordination,\u201d stated 2004 Ohio Department of Job and Family Services materials for obstetricians.\n\nKasich, ever willing to pound legislators from his bully pulpit, called out Rep. Terry Johnson and Sen. Shannon Jones, both Republicans, during the speech Thursday.\n\n\u201cTerry and Shannon, we\u2019re gonna renew Medicaid expansion in the Legislature, aren\u2019t we, huh, Terry?\u201d Kasich asked, to applause. \u201cNothing can get in our way on this, Terry.\u201d\n\nWhen the crowd laughed, Kasich told attendees of the infant mortality conference to organize protests pushing Obamacare.\n\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m serious, folks, look, I got a lot of you here today \u2014 if that thing is at risk, we\u2019re gonna be marching, you got it?\u201d Kasich said. \u201cWe\u2019re gonna march, and you\u2019re gonna show up because we gotta get this done, OK?\u201d\n\nKasich previously claimed Medicaid expansion is necessary for Ohio\u2019s veterans, drug addicts, the mentally ill and working poor, but spinning the program as beneficial to the unborn is new. Last year, Cleveland Right to Life and Right to Life of Greater Cincinnati were both parties to a lawsuit against Kasich\u2019s Obamacare expansion.\n\n\u201cIt does not well serve Ohio babies or the state at large to encourage a huge subclass of citizens dependent on government assistance from birth,\u201d Right to Life of Greater Cincinnati executive director Paula Westwood said in an email to Ohio Watchdog. \u201cOhio is fast becoming a nanny state.\u201d\n\nBy the Kasich administration\u2019s own estimate, \u201cabout half\u201d of the Ohioans covered under Medicaid expansion are employed.\n\n\u201cExpanding welfare to able-bodied childless adults isn\u2019t going to reduce infant mortality,\u201d Foundation for Government Accountability research director Jonathan Ingram told Ohio Watchdog via email.\n\n\u201cIt didn\u2019t happen in Maine or Arizona when they expanded Medicaid to able-bodied childless adults in the early 2000s, and there\u2019s no reason to think that it will happen in Ohio. Ohio already covered pregnant women earning less than twice the federal poverty limit, back before Kasich decided to move more than 400,000 new able-bodied adults to the front of the line.\u201d\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, Kasich\u2019s unilateral expansion of ObamaCare will prioritize this new class of able-bodied adults over the truly needy, including poor children and pregnant women,\u201d Ingram continued.\n\n\u201cAt the same time Gov. Kasich was lobbying to bring ObamaCare to Ohio, he was busy proposing Medicaid funding cuts for pediatric hospitals. As cost overruns mount and the state share of the expansion bill comes due, who else will Kasich put on the chopping block?\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Ohio Gov.
