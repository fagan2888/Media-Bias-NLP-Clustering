Democratic Presidential Candidate Hillary Clinton, the self-described “pantsuit aficionado” and “hair icon,” has found a new platform for her views: Quora.

The former secretary of state and U.S. senator held forth today on the Affordable Care Act (a.k.a. Obamacare), what could be done to make prescription drugs less expensive and the ramifications of defunding Planned Parenthood.

There was also an answer to the question no one really asked: Why being a grandmother will make her a better president.

Clinton is the first of the 2016 presidential candidates to use Quora, a popular online forum devoted to “democratizing knowledge.” It’s a place where anyone can pose questions and tap into the broader community for answers.

The candidate used another social media platform, Twitter, to broadcast her arrival on Quora.
