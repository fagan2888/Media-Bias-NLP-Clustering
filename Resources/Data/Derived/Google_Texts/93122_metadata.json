The Rockies needed to trade Troy Tulowitzki to Toronto to snag Hoffman. And Freeland, the former standout at Denver\u2019s Thomas Jefferson High School, was waiting. Their lockers sit in the same corner of the Colorado clubhouse.\n\nThey\u2019re nipping at each other\u2019s spikes trying to earn a shot to leave camp with the major-league team.\n\n\u201cWe feed off each other. That\u2019s a good thing we have,\u201d Freeland said. \u201cWe compete in everything \u2014 golf, baseball, you name it.\u201d\n\nRockies Mailbag: Pose a question for Patrick Saunders\n\nHoffman and Freeland made their big league-level debuts Sunday, pitching two innings apiece in a Cactus League road game against Cincinnati. They both impressed, with two hits allowed between them and five strikeouts.\n\nAnd they\u2019re still arguing about it.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s back and forth, telling each other who throws harder, seeing who will give up the most bombs,\u201d said Hoffman, a 24-year-old right-hander selected ninth overall in 2014.\n\nHoffman struck out the first two batters he faced. He threw a full-count curveball to Jake Cave to punch him out looking in the third, then got Ivan De Jesus Jr. to ground out weakly to second base. Hoffman\u2019s fastball averaged around 97.\n\nFreeland, picked No. 8 in 2014, allowed a home run, to Cave, but he struck out one more than Hoffman did, using a controlled fastball at 93-95 mph, with a slider as well.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s got me with velo, but I have him with location,\u201d said Freeland, 23, a left-hander.\n\nHoffman came back: \u201cI\u2019ll take it. I\u2019ll take the harder velocity every day.\u201d\n\nAnd on and on they went.\n\nThe Rockies are aiming for Hoffman and Freeland to tag-team their progress through Triple-A Albuquerque this season.\n\nHoffman last season moved swiftly through Single-A and up a level, with a 3.22 ERA over seven games with Double-A New Britain, after he was traded to Colorado.\n\nFreeland pitched seven games at High-A Modesto last season after surgery to remove bone chips and scar tissue from his elbow. But he made up for lost time in the Arizona Fall League, pitching well enough for an invitation to spring camp.\n\nThey\u2019re both pitching in the country club environment of the big leagues for the first time. And their schedules are synched, from bullpens to Cactus League games.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been talking about it since our last live BP,\u201d Hoffman said. \u201cIt felt like forever to get back to the mound. We were real excited to be out there, especially on the same day.\u201d\n\nHoffman\u2019s curveball was his most impressive pitch, which stayed sneaky through two innings. Freeland filled up the zone with fastball placement and a well-timed changeup.\n\n\u201cEspecially at this level, it was great to get that competition going,\u201d Freeland said.\n\nNick Groke: ngroke@denverpost.com or @nickgroke", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Jeff Hoffman and Kyle Freeland go back-to-back in big Rockies debuts", "title": "Jeff Hoffman and Kyle Freeland go back-to-back in big Rockies debuts", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/03/06/jeff-hoffman-and-kyle-freeland-go-back-to-back-in-big-rockies-debuts/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160306__kyle-freeland-rockiesp1.jpg", "height": 430}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160306__kyle-freeland-rockiesp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2016-03-06T20:38:20+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-15T01:48:54+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "But he made up for lost time in the Arizona Fall League, pitching well enough for an invitation to spring camp.\nJeff Hoffman and Kyle Freeland, drafted back-to-back in 2014, can\u2019t get rid of each other.\nHoffman struck out the first two batters he faced.\nThe Rockies are aiming for Hoffman and Freeland to tag-team their progress through Triple-A Albuquerque this season.\nFreeland pitched seven games at High-A Modesto last season after surgery to remove bone chips and scar tissue from his elbow."}
