(Photo: Getty Images/iStockphoto)\n\nIntentional or not, you leave behind a cybershadow, or digital footprint, when using the Internet to send and receive information. These footprints create an online identity that includes information about your age, gender, sexual orientation, race, religious and political views, buying habits and much more.\n\nIn 2015, we can look forward to enhanced software technologies that will help limit the creation of our cybershadows.\n\nYour information, encrypted\n\nStop and think about it. Anything you search for, send or receive through a Web browser, text, email or the cloud can be hacked and read verbatim unless it\u2019s encrypted. This frequently overlooked villain lurking around and reading anything you type could compromise information you want and thought to be private.\n\nClearly, it\u2019s crucial that we understand how our information is encrypted. One way to do this is to password protect your documents.\n\nLast August, Google announced a movement for HTTPs everywhere to reiterate Web safety. When entering any kind of information over the Internet, be sure the web address begins with https. The \u201cs\u201d denotes a Secure Socket Layer (SSL). Additionally, most browsers also display a small padlock icon to represent a secure site.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that encrypting information does not prevent a message from being intercepted during transit but does keep the intercepting party from reading the message.\n\nBe aware of your overshare\n\nAs I\u2019ve mentioned, every digitally written word, video or picture is recorded in some form. Beware of the amount and type of information you share.\n\nOversharing and bashtags were so pervasive in our culture last year that they were chosen as words of the year by Chambers and Collins dictionaries for 2014. What term did Oxford Dictionary choose for 2014? Vape, but I digress.\n\nChambers dictionary defines oversharing as being \u201cunacceptably forthcoming with information about one\u2019s personal life.\u201d Collins dictionary defines a bashtag as \u201ca hashtag used for critical or abusive comments.\u201d\n\nYou may recall from my recent column \u201cThe year of the hack\u201d that even if you\u2019ve deleted your messages, they are still saved on the hard drive of your computer, tablet and/or smartphone. That\u2019s the problem with \u201canonymous\u201d social apps like Snapchat and Swipe.\n\nEnter Mark Cuban, prominent entrepreneur, judge on \u201cShark Tank\u201d and owner of the Dallas Mavericks. His new texting app startup Cyber Dust protects the privacy of the individual sending the message and prevents either party from embedding the message onto a hard drive. Using Random Access Memory (RAM) to send messages, Cyber Dust text messages disappear 24 seconds after they are sent and cannot be restored by sender or receiver. This is an important differentiation as to what components of technology are used for Cyber Dust versus Snapchat, as an example.\n\nCuban hasn\u2019t revealed his future plans for Cyber Dust, but here\u2019s hoping the next phase allows users to eliminate their digital thumbprints across the entire Web.\n\nFor 2015, join me in resolving to be aware of your amount of overshare. Encrypt documents with passwords and take advantage of new software tools like SSL and Cyber Dust that allow you to eliminate your cybershadow from lurking in the depths of the Internet.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://tnne.ws/1IaAfjD", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "In 2015, enhanced software technologies should help limit the creation of cybershadows.", "og": {"site_name": "The Tennessean", "description": "In 2015, enhanced software technologies should help limit the creation of cybershadows.", "title": "Take control of your cybershadows", "url": "http://www.tennessean.com/story/money/tech/2015/01/04/take-control-cybershadows/21120885/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/tennessean.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "In 2015, enhanced software technologies should help limit the creation of cybershadows.", "title": "Take control of your cybershadows", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/0b127ef6bdeca0a7997ada31f1919c35b81de662/c=354-0-1769-1415&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/Nashville/2014/12/31/B9315702959Z.1_20141231164735_000_G7C9IBI5C.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@tennessean", "site": "@tennessean", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600028886", "fb": {"app_id": 121487414583460}, "viewport": "width=1070", "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Persons/Mark Cuban", "gci-asset-type": "data", "gci-categories": "Persons/Mark Cuban", "title": "Take control of your cybershadows", "author": "Julie May", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "money/tech", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/d2e7a85b4bd063ace2090d89aef4eda2bd238488/c=530-0-1591-1415/local/-/media/Nashville/2014/12/31/B9315702959Z.1_20141231164735_000_G7C9IBI5C.1-0.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/a558841cd04604e9c406ed906d857f468d720123/c=354-0-1769-1415/local/-/media/Nashville/2014/12/31/B9315702959Z.1_20141231164735_000_G7C9IBI5C.1-0.jpg", "contenttype": "data", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/783f79c3c51247259b4a1260c31b76e17fb630a5/c=118-0-2005-1415/local/-/media/Nashville/2014/12/31/B9315702959Z.1_20141231164735_000_G7C9IBI5C.1-0.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/98e708b1a7434219c8813e5d7127d62cc2e72c14/c=0-110-2122-1304&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/Nashville/2014/12/31/B9315702959Z.1_20141231164735_000_G7C9IBI5C.1-0.jpg", "publishtime": "2015-01-03T23:02:27.150000-06:00", "shorthed": "Get control of your cybershadows", "articleid": 21120885, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/ff08101970c9b392424972bf0f5861a9adca4d8f/c=0-110-2122-1304/local/-/media/Nashville/2014/12/31/B9315702959Z.1_20141231164735_000_G7C9IBI5C.1-0.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/ffc67a26470f393546dbef23c1b70abee17b3153/c=663-0-1459-1415/local/-/media/Nashville/2014/12/31/B9315702959Z.1_20141231164735_000_G7C9IBI5C.1-0.jpg"}}, "news_keywords": "technology, Julie May, cybershadows, digital footprint, bashtag, oversharing"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd67e9\"", "article_summary": "With Mark Cuban\u2019s texting app startup Cyber Dust, text messages disappear 24 seconds after they are sent and cannot be restored by sender or receiver.\nThis is an important differentiation as to what components of technology are used for Cyber Dust versus Snapchat, as an example.\nIn 2015, we can look forward to enhanced software technologies that will help limit the creation of our cybershadows.\nUsing Random Access Memory (RAM) to send messages, Cyber Dust text messages disappear 24 seconds after they are sent and cannot be restored by sender or receiver.\nEncrypt documents with passwords and take advantage of new software tools like SSL and Cyber Dust that allow you to eliminate your cybershadow from lurking in the depths of the Internet."}
