The Rams were overmatched, which has become commonplace against the Broncos. CSU is 0-4 against Boise State in the past four years and has been outscored 184-81.\n\nThe Broncos ran up 676 yards of total offense, including 219 yards on the ground from running Jay Ajayi, plus 432 yards of total offense from quarterback Grant Hedrick \u2014 352 through the air and 80 more rushing.\n\n\u201cThey took it to us,\u201d McElwain said. \u201cAnd I really think what we need to do is we have to be the attackers. We do at times and we\u2019re aggressive and the guys get after it a bit, and yet other times, maybe they\u2019re reading a little bit too much, I don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nRunning back Dee Hart suffered a finger injury late in the game, and had just 16 yards on 10 carries. The Rams ran for just 28 yards.\n\n\u201cThey took him in and X rayed it, and he\u2019ll be OK,\u201d McElwain said. \u201cWe just didn\u2019t have that spark out of that position this week and a lot of that had to do with the guys in blue were hitting us. . . But when you simply can\u2019t run it, bad things are going to happen. And we just couldn\u2019t run it.\u201d\n\nThe Rams\u2019 retooled offensive line was missing its only returning starter from a year ago \u2014 senior left tackle Ty Sambrailo, out with a sprained knee.\n\n\u201cTheir linebackers were shooting some gaps and we were hanging on some blocks a little bit, some double teams,\u201d McElwain said. \u201cWe were getting beat at the point of attack. It\u2019ll be a great lesson for those young guys.\u201d\n\nWith the Rams forced to rely on the passing game, Garrett Grayson threw for 434 yards and three touchdowns \u2014 one each to Joe Hansley, Steven Walker and Jasen Oden Jr.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s fun, but in a loss?\u201d asked McElwain. \u201cFor us to be good, we have to be balanced. But I did see the receivers take a step in the right direction from last week. They competed, they showed a little bit of their speed. . . Yeah, I don\u2019t think we\u2019re built that way to throw it every down. I really don\u2019t.\u201d\n\nCSU was rallying late when Grayson was picked off, ending any hope of a miracle comeback. \u201cThat\u2019s something I can\u2019t do,\u201d Grayson said. \u201cI take the blame on that.\u201d\n\nThe Rams play their first home game of the season Saturday against FCS opponent UC Davis of the Big Sky Conference.\n\nTerry Frei: tfrei@denverpost.com or twitter.com/TFrei\n\nEye on\u2026 The Aggies\n\nUC Davis at Colorado State, 1 p.m. Saturday\n\nFor the record: UC Davis is 1-1 after getting shellacked by Stanford 45-0 in its opener and beating Division II Fort Lewis of the Rocky Mountain Athletic Conference 52-17 at home. The Aggies are in the Football Champ- ionship Subdivision\u2019s Big Sky Conference, along with Northern Colorado, among others. But through three games, they won\u2019t yet have played an FCS opponent.\n\nStreaking: Dating to last season, the Aggies have won three of their past four games. Who\u2019s hot: Jermale Jefferson, a freshman from Los Angeles, rushed for 122 yards and two touchdowns against Fort Lewis on only five carries. Who\u2019s not: Place-kicker Grady Stuart missed two field-goal attempts against Fort Lewis. Not that it mattered.\n\nKey stat: The Aggies have allowed 528 yards passing. FYI: Ron Gould, a former Oregon defensive back and longtime assistant at California, is in his second season as the Aggies\u2019 head coach. A year ago, they were 5-3 in the Big Sky and 5-7 overall.\n\nTerry Frei, The Denver Post", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "CSU looks to rebound after getting overwhelmed at Boise State, 37-24", "title": "CSU looks to rebound after getting overwhelmed at Boise State, 37-24", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/09/07/csu-looks-to-rebound-after-getting-overwhelmed-at-boise-state-37-24/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140907__CSUBOISEp1.jpg", "height": 436}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140907__CSUBOISEp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-09-07T15:24:32+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T10:41:41+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Colorado State University"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1e17\"", "article_summary": "\u201cTheir linebackers were shooting some gaps and we were hanging on some blocks a little bit, some double teams,\u201d McElwain said.\nThey competed, they showed a little bit of their speed.\nCSU is 0-4 against Boise State in the past four years and has been outscored 184-81.\nBOISE, Idaho \u2014 As the Colorado State Rams filed quietly out of the visiting dressing room beneath the south end zone stands at Albertsons Stadium, picked up boxed meals and headed to the buses, it was nearly 1 a.m. Sunday.\nBoise State roll to a 30-10 halftime lead and cruised to a 37-24 victory."}
