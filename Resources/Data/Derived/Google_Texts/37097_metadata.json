Hornbeck says on December 30, 2015, three people entered his store, stealing an estimated $1,000 in liquor and cash. Hornbeck says his register did not balance out after that day.\n\nThe three people, two men and one large woman with a walker entered the store around 8:30 p.m., driving a GM car, possibly a Chevrolet Malibu or Oldsmobile Cutlass.\n\nIn the video Hornbeck released to KAKE News, he points out where the woman shoves a bottle of liquor into her bra.\n\n\"I couldn't believe the audacity of these people.....the nerve, just coming in here, acting like another day at the office for them,\" Hornbeck said.\n\nAt one point, one of the men tried to use a credit card, which the machine reader denied. Hornbeck says the man took the opportunity to take alcohol to his car while saying he would come back with another credit card. The next credit card was also denied.\n\nThe three people got away and the clerk did call 911.\n\nDerby Liquor is updating their security video system and they have other plans to make sure they stop shoplifters if they ever come back.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "video", "description": "Derby Liquor's owner says shoplifters got away with an estimated $1,000 from a December 30th incident.", "language": "english", "author": "Bryan Ramsdale", "og": {"description": "Derby Liquor's owner says shoplifters got away with an estimated $1,000 from a December 30th incident.", "title": "Derby Liquor releases video of shoplifters, offers reward", "url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/Derby-liquor-store-releases-video-of-shoplifters-364794931.html", "image": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/11C/40E/11C40ED76AD14635A657B39592D2834F", "video": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/D4A/6F6/D4A6F68A077E4C33A27323995C595C38.mp4", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.kake.com", "description": "Derby Liquor's owner says shoplifters got away with an estimated $1,000 from a December 30th incident.", "title": "Derby Liquor releases video of shoplifters, offers reward", "url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/Derby-liquor-store-releases-video-of-shoplifters-364794931.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/derby+liquor+shoplift.jpg", "creator": "@KAKEnews", "site": "@KAKEnews", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "video_type": "video/mp4", "video_height": 288, "keywords": "Derby Liquor releases video of shoplifters, offers reward", "google-site-verification": "H0mev8O__gMqb34WcvOyZgBXFMRQZvDAQ0YTSGJ9hGQ", "video_width": 512, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Derby Liquor releases video of, shoplifters"}, "article_summary": "Derby Liquor is updating their security video system and they have other plans to make sure they stop shoplifters if they ever come back.\nSteve Hornbeck and his wife own Derby Liquor in Derby, Kansas.\nDerby Liquor is offering a $500 reward for the identification and arrest of the people who shoplifted from the store in late December.\nIn the video Hornbeck released to KAKE News, he points out where the woman shoves a bottle of liquor into her bra.\nAt one point, one of the men tried to use a credit card, which the machine reader denied."}
