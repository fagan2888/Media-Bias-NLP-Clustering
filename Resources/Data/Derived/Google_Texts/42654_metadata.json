And now, of course, everyone\u2019s waiting to see him in the Rob Marshall film \u201cInto the Woods,\u201d which will be released Christmas Day.\n\nWay back in August, we told you why we think Mr. Corden will soar from \u201cThe Late, Late Show\u201d on CBS to whatever other comedy he wants. That\u2019s big talk, we know, but when you watch him, we bet you\u2019ll believe too.\n\nThere\u2019s no reason to wait for spring or wait in line at the theater to find out. One of the best James Corden primers you\u2019ll find is the BBC show \u201cGavin & Stacey,\u201d which you can tune into on BBC One, Netflix and other streaming networks. Don\u2019t be surprised if you become so involved in the show you buy it for home. (Remember to request the U.S. format of the discs though.)\n\nAt first glance you might be concerned that the show is dated. It aired for 20 episodes between May 2007 and January 2010. But like the early episodes of the U.S. version of \u201cThe Office\u201d and classic television such as \u201cThe Dick Van Dyke Show,\u201d this comedy is timeless thanks to nuanced writing and superb acting.\n\nMr. Corden and Ruth Jones, another acclaimed comedic British actor, wrote the show about a young Englishman named Gavin who falls in love with a young Welsh woman, Stacey. The geographic and cultural differences are the basis for much of the show\u2019s humor, which hinges on key moments in the lovebirds\u2019 courtship and young marriage.\n\nWhat makes it work when so many similar comedies have failed is that Mr. Corden and Miss Jones fully developed the secondary characters, two of which they play (Mr. Corden plays Gavin\u2019s best pal, \u201cSmithy,\u201d and Miss Jones plays Stacey\u2019s BFF, \u201cNessa\u201d). And the characters range from friends of the couple to the couple\u2019s siblings, parents, elderly neighbors and random acquaintances.\n\nThe two main characters are played by Mathew Horne, whose past work includes \u201cHorne & Corden,\u201d a British sketch comedy the two developed while working on \u201cGavin & Stacey,\u201d and Joanna Page, whose work includes guesting on \u201cDr. Who.\u201d Press reports state Ms. Page has immersed herself in family life in Oxfordshire, England.\n\nThe rest of the cast are equally talented veteran actors, as underscored by the slew of National Television and British Academy of Film and Television Awards (BAFTA) the comedy and its cast won.\n\nYou may wonder why, if the show is so addictive, it hasn\u2019t been remade for U.S. television.\n\nFox tried to do so just last year. News organizations reported the network ordered 13 episodes of a remake (to be titled \u201cUs and Them\u201d) that starred Alexis Bledel (\u201cGilmore Girls\u201d) and Jason Ritter (\u201cParenthood\u201d). Then the network announced it would air only six episodes.\n\nFinally, Fox axed the remake without airing any of the shows, citing poor quality.\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to feel sad about the failure to remake \u201cGavin & Stacey\u201d after you\u2019ve watched the original comedy that, corny as it sounds, takes everyday family and social situations and makes them alternatively joyful and heartbreaking.\n\nLike \u201cThe Dick Van Dyke Show,\u201d \u201cI Love Lucy\u201d and its modern-day equivalents \u2014 including ABC\u2019s \u201cModern Family\u201d and \u201cThe Big Bang Theory\u201d on CBS \u2014 the creators of \u201cGavin & Stacey\u201d struck gold through talent and a series of happy accidents.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Late-night TV fans might not even realize what a holiday gift CBS presented when it announced British comedian James Corden will take over for Craig Ferguson on March 23.
