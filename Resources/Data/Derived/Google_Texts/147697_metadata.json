That paltry figure can be chalked up to at least two things. One, the group went big, spending around $56 million on television and other types of advertising as it tried desperately to get Bush out of the corner he\u2019d been battered into by billionaire Donald Trump and Sen. Marco Rubio, a former prot\u00e9g\u00e9 who is still alive and well in the race for the White House.\n\nBut that burned the candle at both ends: the farther and farther down the polls Bush tumbled, the more the super PAC\u2019s fundraising dried up.

Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker dropped out of the race last September in part because he couldn\u2019t break through the Trump din but also because he couldn\u2019t pay all of his expenses, including a payroll that had an $89,000 post for his wife and a communications director at an annual salary of $220,000.\n\nAs the post-mortem over the Bush campaign continues, expect to see more obscure political operatives with eye-popping golden parachutes coming in for very soft landings.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush dropped out of the Republican presidential primary two days ago, prompting campaign officials and supporters to look for scapegoat for the debacle, and they may have settled on a pricey one, indeed.", "title": "Did the Head of a Pro-Bush Super PAC Make $14 Million?", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/02/22/Did-Head-Pro-Bush-Super-PAC-Make-14-Million", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/02192016_Jeb_Bush.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/02/22/Did-Head-Pro-Bush-Super-PAC-Make-14-Million", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/02192016_Jeb_Bush.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush dropped out of the Republican presidential primary two days ago, prompting campaign officials and supporters to look for scapegoat for the debacle, and they may have settled on a pricey one, indeed.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Political strategist Mike Murphy, head of the pro-Bush super PAC Right to Rise USA, is under fire for allegedly giving himself a salary and compensation package that totals $14 million.\nRelated: Jeb Bush Suspends His Campaign After Being Trounced in South Carolina\"He made minimum of $14 million,\" a Bush campaign bundler told CNN.\nRelated: A Rubio Super PAC Channels Harry Potter to Take on TrumpAfter raising more than $118 million, Right to Rise USA has somewhere around $3 million left in its coffers.\nAs the post-mortem over the Bush campaign continues, expect to see more obscure political operatives with eye-popping golden parachutes coming in for very soft landings.\nBut that burned the candle at both ends: the farther and farther down the polls Bush tumbled, the more the super PAC\u2019s fundraising dried up."}
