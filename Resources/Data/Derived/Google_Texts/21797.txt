A car crashed into a piece of history in Toomsuba.

At 7:00 p.m. Sunday, the Lauderdale County Sheriff's Dept. got a call that a driver lost control of his car and crashed into a building on Russell Topton Road. No one was injured, but the building was hurt pretty badly. Harlan Davis says his great-grandfather opened this building as a store in 1905. Since then, it's operated as a commissary and now as a storage facility. He says it's hard to believe the building survived through many storms and hurricanes only to be taken out 110 years later by a car.

"I've thought about lightning a lot striking it. And possibly a tornado. It's occurred to me that this could happen, a car could hit it. That has entered my mind, but I didn't really think it would happen," Davis says.

Davis says he's not sure yet whether they will try to repair the old store.
