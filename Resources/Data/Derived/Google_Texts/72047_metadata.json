Give it three more presidential election cycles and the Democrat Party\u2019s platform will be expressly antireligious.\n\nToday, they still pretend not to hate the concept of faith or hold those who have it in contempt. You\u2019ll see Hillary hitting plenty of black churches in 2016 \u2013 after all, that condescending empty suit is in no ways tired. But otherwise, Democrats are delighting in their opportunity to burden, harass and humiliate the believing. They use Obamacare to try to force the faithful to breach their consciences. They demand that believers be silent or lose their livelihoods. Their liberal academic flunkies do everything possible to marginalize those of us who feel that life must mean more than dreary obedience to liberal orthodoxy.\n\nThey are getting closer to outright admitting what we all know they really think. Part of it is fashion \u2013 boutique atheism is trendy. Part of it is snobbery \u2013 the same people who think socialism is a viable system like to look down on others for believing in \u201cfantasies.\u201d But mostly, liberals worship Government and don\u2019t like the competition.\n\nIt's important to distinguish between regular atheists and the militant liberal atheists. There are plenty of conservative atheists who don't feel a connection to God but share conservative values. The Democrats are militant atheists. They are atheists because they imagine they are smarter and wiser than people like Isaac Newton, Abraham Lincoln, Dr. Martin Luther King, and about 85% of the rest of America.\n\nThey are proud believers in \u201cScience.\u201d That\u2019s different from science. Science is the one where you take evidence and draw conclusions from it. \u201cScience\u201d is the one where you figure out what gives liberals the most power and shriek at anyone who dissents. This explains how the \u201cScience\u201d is settled that cold weather proves global warming.\n\nThe Democrat Party\u2019s changing composition makes it possible to be openly anti-God. It\u2019s now made up of a very rich urban elite and the poor. The urban elite despises God. They aren\u2019t even lapsed faithful \u2013 you had to have faith once to have it lapse and most of them grew up in the secular world of elite universities and liberal coastal enclaves where you\u2019re more likely to encounter some feminist babbling about Gaia than someone who has attended mass non-ironically.\n\nPlus, being God-free lets liberals take advantage of the moral ambiguity of situational ethics. It provides them with the kind of wiggle room they need to do exactly what they want without any annoying principles obstructing them.\n\nAmong the rest of the Democrat base, some are still notable for their religious engagement, particularly the black churchwomen we always see the liberal icon du jourpatronizing at election time. It will be interesting to see whether they choose God or Mammon when their party rulers come out and say what they really think \u2013 that the religious are suckers and freedom of religion only applies if it doesn\u2019t interfere with progressive prerogatives.\n\nSure, we occasionally see a few liberal evangelicals get trotted out by the mainstream media to tut-tut believers who actually believe in something more than free money for the lazy. Their ideology is just socialism with a thin veneer of Jesus. And it\u2019s a Jesus who appears nowhere in the Bible, a gutless hippie who runs from fights and thinks that the Gospel requires you to keep fishing while giving away your catch to the dude kicking back on the beach because he doesn\u2019t feel like casting his own net.\n\nIn the coming years, we will hear a lot about how progressive Europeans are leading the way in casting off the shackles of religion. But not everyone in Eurpoe is casting them off. Europe may be losing Christians, but it\u2019s gaining Muslims. You can tell them because they're the ones with the babies.\n\nEuropeans are leading the way to progressive extinction. When your society believes in nothing beyond the next statutory six-week paid vacation and your guaranteed pension at age 42, you don't have much incentive to invest in the future of mankind. Accordingly, you don't make babies. The thing is, though, societies tend to belong to those who reproduce. So get out there and make more babies, American conservatives.\n\nIt\u2019s only a matter of time before the Democrat Party comes out and proudly admits to being what it inarguably is today, the party of hopelessness, the party of no future, the party of \u201cJust give me money until this whole thing called life ends in oblivion.\u201d\n\nWe'll soon find out how the allegedly religious react to a party that loves their votes but think they are fools for believing. We will soon know where their faith really lies, in government checks or the word of God.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Democrats are waging war on the faithful and are even comfortable booing God on national TV.
