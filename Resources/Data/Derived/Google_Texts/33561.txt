MASON CITY, Iowa – In front of a packed house at Village Court in Mason City, Dr. Ben Carson shares why he’s the best fit for leading our country.

“We’re really fortunate in Iowa to have the opportunity to get to see and hear all these presidential candidates in a one-on-one intimate environment,” Doug Rozendaal from Clear Lake said.

Dr. Carson is a Detroit native and renowned neurosurgeon. He’s built a career helping others and says he’s ready to be the leader our country needs. That requires making stops across the nation, especially in small communities.

“I’ve enjoyed coming to all of the smaller venues here in Iowa because you have a chance to be one-on-one with lots of people and really get a sense of who the American people are,” Dr. Carson said. Dr. Carson addressed several issues including the Affordable Care Act, getting people to vote, and most notably a U.S. and Iran nuclear deal.

“It’s one of the worst deals we’ve ever done. It makes no sense. In no way does it stop them from making nuclear weapons, and all it does is makes it clear to the rest of the Middle East that they better get going on their nuclear projects,” Dr. Carson said.

He admits he was on the brink of retirement, but now, he’s embracing being put on a different path.

“People are looking for somebody who’s not a politician, who’s not just trying to put another notch on their belt. Who has a history of solving problems, who loves his country, and wants to get us on the right track.”

For those listening, including Doug Rozendaal, coming to events like this is educating yourself toward an educated presidential vote.

“I think it’s important for all Iowans to get out and be involved in the process and meet these folks one-on-one, shake their hands, and learn what it is they have to say,” Rozendaal said.
