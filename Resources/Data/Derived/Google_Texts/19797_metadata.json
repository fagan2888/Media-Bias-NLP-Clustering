(AP) - Steve Spagnolo missed the block parties of his old stomping grounds in Pennsylvania when he moved to Kempsville 15 years ago.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to get this neighborhood jumping a bit,\u201d he told his wife, Suzee.\n\nShe went out of town for a weekend. He built a bar in the garage.\n\nSpagnolo, a 45-year-old high school math teacher, covered the bar with old pictures and Plexiglas, like he used to do in college with wood crate furniture, he said. But then he changed his mind and instead glued bottle caps to the bar top. On a roll, he covered the back of a bar stool with them, too.\n\nSpagnolo further tricked out his man cave with a surround-sound stereo system, a couch and a dartboard. He filled the shelves with beer glasses he found at thrift stores. He mounted a bottle opener marked \u201cchurch key\u201d on a retractable string, which doubles as his wife\u2019s laundry line.\n\nA popcorn machine gets moved in front of the dryer when neighbors gather, which occurs almost weekly. The Spagnolos\u2019 garage has become the social crux of the court.\n\nVisitors play cornhole and yard games while Spagnolo mans the grill in the driveway. He keeps the garage refrigerator stocked with beer, soda and water.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re such good neighbors,\u201d said Frank Latham, relaxing there in a lawn chair on a recent Saturday evening. \u201cYou just feel right at home.\u201d\n\nBottlecaps go in a bucket on the bar. Spagnolo has hundreds of them, sorted by color or style in bags and boxes on a shelf, waiting for the next project.\n\nThe ceiling, he said, looking up.\n\nHis wife smiled and glanced around at the friendly faces relaxing and enjoying the space.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t pull my car in here,\u201d she said, \u201cbut it\u2019s worth it.\u201d\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Virginian-Pilot, http://pilotonline.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "Steve Spagnolo missed the block parties of his old stomping grounds in Pennsylvania when he moved to Kempsville 15 years ago.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Steve Spagnolo missed the block parties of his old stomping grounds in Pennsylvania when he moved to Kempsville 15 years ago.", "title": "Man builds bottle cap-covered bar in garage", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/may/3/man-builds-bottle-cap-covered-bar-in-garage/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/05/03/5c9a73f4539c2913750f6a7067008325.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/05/03/5c9a73f4539c2913750f6a7067008325.jpg", "description": "Steve Spagnolo missed the block parties of his old stomping grounds in Pennsylvania when he moved to Kempsville 15 years ago.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Man builds bottle cap-covered bar in garage"}, "Author": "STACY PARKER", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca854\"", "article_summary": "But then he changed his mind and instead glued bottle caps to the bar top.\nHe built a bar in the garage.\nSpagnolo, a 45-year-old high school math teacher, covered the bar with old pictures and Plexiglas, like he used to do in college with wood crate furniture, he said.\nHe mounted a bottle opener marked \u201cchurch key\u201d on a retractable string, which doubles as his wife\u2019s laundry line.\nSpagnolo further tricked out his man cave with a surround-sound stereo system, a couch and a dartboard."}
