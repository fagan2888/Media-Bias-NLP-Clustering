Since expanding visiting hours beyond 10 a.m. to 8:30 p.m., patient satisfaction ratings increased significantly, and more than 14,000 visitors that would have been turned away in the past were about to see their loved ones, hospital President David Shulkin, M.D., told the news outlet.\n\nMeanwhile, University of Wisconsin Hospital and Clinic aims to be more inclusive of who can visit patients, according to the facility's website. Patients can identify a small number of primary support people, such as a family member, partner or best friend who can provide physical, psychological and emotional support, to visit at any hour of the day. Regular visitors can visit anytime between 8 a.m. and 9 p.m., with some restrictions on patients in the ICU or burn unit.\n\nHowever, some hospitals are still leery about opening up one of the most intense and volatile areas of the hospital to visitors, an area crowded with live-saving machines and monitors. More visitors could mean more infection-carrying individuals, more distractions, less rest for patients and interference in care, some officials worry, the Free Press reported.\n\nFor instance, Parkridge Health System in Chattanooga limits visits to 40 minutes, three times a day, citing concerns about privacy, infections and adverse social dynamics, Jerri Underwood, chief nursing executive, told the newspaper. The hospital does work with families who have odd schedules so patients can still get all the family support they need. Neighboring Memorial Health Care System extended hours to one-hour blocks, four times a day, according to the article, while tailoring needs of patients and families.\n\nBut more and more research shows having family to advocate and show support for the patient can increase family satisfaction provide caregivers with a better understanding of how to care for their loved ones long-term, according to the article.\n\nAlthough staff were initially hesitant about the policy change, Erlanger's ICU Nurse Manager Ted Nelson said in the days, weeks and months after the implementation of longer visitation hours, they grew comfortable and responded positively. Family members were even more excited. \"They could leave work at lunch time and visit, instead of waiting for those blocks of time that were very limited,\" Nelson told the Free Press.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- read the NJ.com article\n\n- check out UW Hospital's visitor guidelines\n\n- here's the Free Press article\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nHospitals fall short on compliance with state, fed visitation policies\n\nHospitals need updated visitation policies, staff training\n\nMore hospitals open doors to family pet visits\n\nHospitals struggle to implement visitation policies", "article_metadata": {"description": "Several Tennessee hospitals recently expanded their\u00a0vistation hours\u00a0in an effort to better engage patients and families, the\u00a0Times Free Press\u00a0reported.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "Several Tennessee hospitals recently expanded their\u00a0vistation hours\u00a0in an effort to better engage patients and families, the\u00a0Times Free Press\u00a0reported.", "title": "Hospitals expand visiting hours to accommodate patients, families", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/hospitals-expand-visiting-hours-accommodate-patients-families/2014-09-02", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "Care Delivery,Erlanger Health System,hospital visitation policies,Intensive Care Unit,Memorial Health Care System,Parkridge Health System,Patient Care & Outcomes,Patient Satisfaction", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Care Delivery,Patient Care & Outcomes,Patient Satisfaction"}, "article_summary": "Several Tennessee hospitals recently expanded their visitation hours in an effort to better engage patients and families, the Times Free Press reported.\nThe hospital does work with families who have odd schedules so patients can still get all the family support they need.\n\"Hospitals are no longer just assuming they know what patients' families need, but are actually asking them.\"\nMorristown Medical Center in New Jersey is now open to visitors 24 hours a day, seven days a week, NJ.com reported.\n\"There is a renewed focus on patient-focused care that means better engaging with patients' families,\" Clarke said."}
