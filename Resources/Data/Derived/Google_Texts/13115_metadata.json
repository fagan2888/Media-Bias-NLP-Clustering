availability of good jobs tops the list of voters\u2019 priorities among both parties heading into the November midterm elections, a new poll showed on Thursday.\n\nWhile Democrats and Republicans mostly agree on those issues, they diverge on other concerns such as the threat of Islamic militants and equal pay for women, the Gallup poll showed.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nRepublicans rate the situation with Islamic militants as their second concern \u2014 85 percent listed it as the top problem \u2014 while the issue ran sixth for Democrats, with 72 percent giving it top priority.\n\nBoth sides also place a high priority on how the federal government is working, with Democrats listing it fourth and Republicans fifth.\n\nThe No. 1 problem for Democrats (89%) is the availability of good jobs while 91 percent of Republicans made the economy their top issue.\n\nJobs were third for Republicans at 83 percent while the economy came in second for Democrats at 86 percent.\n\nOverall, the least important issues to voters are climate change and abortion and access to contraception, which appear near the bottom of the list for both political groups.\n\nTwo of Democrats' top five issues \u2014 equal pay for women and income distribution \u2014 are much less important for Republicans, with gaps of 29 points (87 vs 58) on equal pay and 21 points (75 vs. 54) on income distribution.\n\nBy party, climate change, abortion and access to contraception are more important to Democrats while the deficit, taxes, immigration and the ongoing situation with Islamic militants are more important to Republicans.\n\nEconomic growth is improving and the labor market is chugging along at a solid pace, even though improvements haven\u2019t given a boost to President Obama and congressional Democrats.\n\nThe poll suggests that Democratic candidates sould focus on inequality-related issues, including equal pay for women to spur voter turnout.\n\nRepublicans would do better to focus on the Islamic militant situation in Iraq and Syria, the deficit and taxes and immigration.\n\nGallup's previous assessments of issue priority also have put the economy near the top of concerns.\n\nThe survey was conducted Sept. 25-30.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The economy and the availability of good jobs tops the list of voters\u2019 priorities among both parties heading into
