But some think her smooth legs and rock hard abs are computer-generated.\n\n\u201cI work out five or six times a week,\u201d Rowland told Shape. \u201cI feel better, look better, sleep better... Being fit makes me feel sexy. Isn\u2019t that everyone\u2019s goal when they work out, to look good naked?\u201d\n\nThe 32-year-old former Destiny\u2019s Child singer is known for her slim figure and sultry voice. She said she works out at least five days a week with Hollywood trainer Jeanette Jenkins and was even part of her fitness video, Sexy Abs. She attributes her fit body to her tough workout regimen and a commitment to \u201ceating clean.\u201d\n\n\"I never like to say diet,\" she said in a recent interview with TheYBF.com. \"I like to say \u2018eating clean'\u2026 For me, it's green vegetables or fish. I don't feel like I'm heavy or weighed down or lethargic when I eat. Food should give you energy. All I need is a good workout and that's it. I take of myself, take care of my skin, and I watch what I'm eating.\"\n\nRowland\u2019s looks very toned in Shape, but an article in the Daily Mail says she may look too fit. The gossip publication accuses the singer of getting a \u201cphotoshop makeover\u201d and \u201cairbrush treatment.\u201d\n\n\u201cSporting a camouflage crop top the singer\u2019s legs were noticeably smoother and smaller,\u201d the article said. \u201cAnd Kelly\u2019s already toned tummy was clearly stripped away of its thin layer of extra skin with the wave of an airbrush wand.\u201d\n\nAt any rate, one thing is for sure \u2014 airbrush or no airbrush \u2014 the woman is fit. The issue of Shape hit newsstands Friday, September 13.
