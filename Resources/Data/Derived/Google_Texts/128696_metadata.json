Ted Cruz (R-TX) was heckled during a local \u201cmeet and greet\u201d Sunday, the first of ten events in Cruz\u2019s lightning 3-day tour of the Silver State. The incident turned violent with both the heckler and a Cruz supporter getting into a physical altercation and being escorted away from the scene by police officers.\n\nRegistered Democrat Craig Bohanon, 50, shouted from the audience as Cruz spoke from a Ford pickup truck bed which was made into a stage. Mostly unintelligible, Bohanon called Cruz a liar, defended Obamacare, and called for repealing the 16th Amendment.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nCruz supporter, Don, 66, allegedly grabbed Bohanon by his neck in order to silence him.\n\n\u201cHe was screaming in my ear and I couldn\u2019t hear anything,\u201d he told Breitbart News. \u201cHe was saying that Obamacare is something done by Congress and not by Obama. I\u2019m just here to see Ted Cruz.\u201d\n\n\u201cGosh, who would say \u2018liar, liar?\u2019 Cruz joked to the audience. He playfully added that he didn\u2019t realize Bernie Sanders supporters were allowed in Nevada.\n\n\u201cEvery one of us has a right to speak but it doesn\u2019t give us a right to silence others. And you know it\u2019s amazing when people think that the only way to respond with ideas they don\u2019t understand is to yell and scream and insult them and try to yell them down.\u201d\n\nAsked by Breitbart News why he was at the Cruz rally, Bonham said \u201cI am here to hear what the man has to say.\u201d Although he told Breitbart he was not supporting anyone at this point, he later confessed that he would back either Bernie Sanders or Donald Trump.\n\nIn spite of the fact that President Barack Obama has himself referred to the Affordable Care Act as \u201cObamacare,\u201d Bohanon told Breitbart News \u201cthere is no Obamacare. It is the Affordable Healthcare Act. Congress was the one that rewrote it.\u201d\n\nBohanon said he would like to see either Bernie Sanders or Donald Trump win the presidency. \u201cOtherwise we are stuck. We are stagnant. We need somebody who can really go in there and work to make a change. Whether the change is better or worse? We ned to change so we can get out of stagnation.\u201d\n\nHe told Breitbart News that he and his male partner just celebrated their 28th anniversary on February 4.\n\nAsked if socialism frightens him, he said \u201csocialism, no. Communism, yes.\u201d\n\nCruz has more events planned in the state than any other candidate. Rivals Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) and Donald Trump are also planning several events, largely in or near Reno, Elko, and Las Vegas, while Dr. Ben Carson has two events planned in the Reno area.\n\nFollow Adelle Nazarian on Twitter @AdelleNaz.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Ted Cruz was heckled during a local\u00a0\"meet and greet\" Sunday, the first of ten events in Cruz's lightning 3-day tour of Nevada.", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Ted Cruz was heckled during a local\u00a0\"meet and greet\" Sunday, the first of ten events in Cruz's lightning 3-day tour of Nevada.", "title": "Nevada: Ted Cruz Launches Lightning Tour - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 1280, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/02/Cruz-in-Pahrump-John-Locher-Associated-Press.jpg", "height": 959}, "updated_time": "2016-02-22T04:34:30-07:00", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/02/22/nevada-ted-cruz-heckled-democrat-pahrump/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Ted Cruz was heckled during a local\u00a0\"meet and greet\" Sunday, the first of ten events in Cruz's lightning 3-day tour of Nevada.", "title": "Nevada: Ted Cruz Launches Lightning Tour - Breitbart", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/02/Cruz-in-Pahrump-John-Locher-Associated-Press.jpg", "creator": "@AdelleNaz", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true", "app_id": 1243316582352556}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "16th Amendment, affordable care act, Bernie Sanders, heckle, obamacare, Ted Cruz,2016 Presidential Race, Big Government, Breitbart California,Ted Cruz", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "published_time": "2016-02-22T04:14:02-07:00", "section": "2016 Presidential Race", "modified_time": "2016-02-22T04:34:30-07:00", "tag": "Ted Cruz", "categories": "Big Government,Breitbart California,2016 Presidential Race"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "I\u2019m just here to see Ted Cruz.\u201d\u201cGosh, who would say \u2018liar, liar?\u2019 Cruz joked to the audience.\nIn spite of the fact that President Barack Obama has himself referred to the Affordable Care Act as \u201cObamacare,\u201d Bohanon told Breitbart News \u201cthere is no Obamacare.\n\u201cHe was screaming in my ear and I couldn\u2019t hear anything,\u201d he told Breitbart News.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERPAHRUMP, Nevada \u2014 Sen.
