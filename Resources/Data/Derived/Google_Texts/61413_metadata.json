Was it the members of the Catholic Health Association\u2014the supportive audience in front of him? Republicans in Congress? The divided public at large? Or perhaps, was it just the two particular Catholics\u2014Chief Justice John Roberts and Associate Justice Anthony Kennedy\u2014who at this moment hold the fate of Obama\u2019s healthcare law in their hands? In a 25-minute speech, the president never mentioned King v. Burwell, the case now before the Supreme Court in which the justices must decide the legality of federal insurance subsidies for millions of Americans. But his decision to champion his signature achievement in such pointed terms just weeks before the high court\u2019s ruling is due raised the question of whether Obama was trying to jawbone the justices at the 11th hour.\n\nAs he has before, the president turned both to statistics (more than 16 million people covered; the lowest uninsured rate on record) and personal stories (a man whose cancer was caught and cured because of Obamacare insurance) to highlight the benefits of the Affordable Care Act. And with hundreds of Catholics in the audience, Obama made an explicitly moral argument for the law. \u201cIt seems so cynical,\u201d he said, \u201cto want to take coverage away from millions of people; to take care away from people who need it the most; to punish millions with higher costs of care and unravel what\u2019s now been woven into the fabric of America.\u201d It was that final phrase\u2014\u201cwoven into the fabric of America\u201d\u2014that seemed most directed at lawmakers in the Capitol and the justices on the Supreme Court. For Obama, the fight to preserve the healthcare in the face of a serious legal challenge carries a sense of deja vu. It was three years ago this month that Roberts alone, straddling the ideological poles on the court, decided to save Obamacare by declaring its requirement that Americans purchase insurance a constitutional exercise of Congress\u2019s taxing power. The difference this time around, Obama not-so-subtly argued, is that the law is no longer \u201cmyths or rumors.\u201d It is a reality, and so too would be the consequences of unraveling it. \u201cThis is now part of the fabric of how we care for one another,\u201d Obama said. \u201cThis is healthcare in America.\u201d The speech came a day after the president, in response to a reporter\u2019s question, commented directly on the case before the justices, which hinges on whether the law as written allows the federal government to subsidize coverage for residents of states that did not establish their own insurance exchanges. \"Under well-established precedent, there is no reason why the existing exchanges should be overturned through a court case,\" Obama said. \"This should be an easy case. Frankly, it probably shouldn't even have been taken up,\" he added. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine it\u2019ll make any difference, and I can\u2019t imagine he thinks it\u2019ll make any difference.\u201d There\u2019s a long history of presidents trying to lobby the Supreme Court to rule on their behalf, and Franklin Roosevelt famously tried\u2014and failed\u2014to pack the court with additional members when the original nine invalidated parts of the New Deal. Obama himself has clashed repeatedly with the Court during his tenure. In 2010, he criticized its 5-4 decision in the Citizens United campaign-finance case during the State of the Union, while the justices sat directly in front of him (prompting Samuel Alito shake his hand and mouth, \u201cno\u201d). Two years later, he sharply warned the Court not to rule against his healthcare law the first time around. \u201cI'm confident that the Supreme Court will not take what would be an unprecedented, extraordinary step of overturning a law that was passed by a strong majority of a democratically elected Congress,\u201d Obama said then.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The president lays out a passionate defense of the healthcare law just weeks before a major decision is expected.", "author": "Russell Berman", "og": {"site_name": "The Atlantic", "description": "The president laid out a passionate defense of the healthcare law just weeks before the justices upheld it.", "title": "Did Obama Sway the Supreme Court?", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2015/06/Obama_Roberts/lead_large.jpg", "url": "http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/06/is-obama-trying-to-jawbone-the-supreme-court/395459/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "theatlantic.com", "site": "@theatlantic", "card": "summary"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "p": {"domain_verify": "68e1a0361a557708fefc992f3309ed70"}, "fb": {"admins": "577048155,17301937", "page_id": 29259828486, "app_id": 100770816677686}, "keywords": "The Atlantic, The Atlantic Magazine, TheAtlantic.com, Atlantic, news, opinion, breaking news, analysis, commentary, business, politics, culture, international, science, technology, national and life", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, width=device-width, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdaba8\"", "article_summary": "\"Under well-established precedent, there is no reason why the existing exchanges should be overturned through a court case,\" Obama said.\nTwo years later, he sharply warned the Court not to rule against his healthcare law the first time around.\nOr perhaps, was it just the two particular Catholics\u2014Chief Justice John Roberts and Associate Justice Anthony Kennedy\u2014who at this moment hold the fate of Obama\u2019s healthcare law in their hands?\n\u201cI'm confident that the Supreme Court will not take what would be an unprecedented, extraordinary step of overturning a law that was passed by a strong majority of a democratically elected Congress,\u201d Obama said then.\nFor Obama, the fight to preserve the healthcare in the face of a serious legal challenge carries a sense of deja vu."}
