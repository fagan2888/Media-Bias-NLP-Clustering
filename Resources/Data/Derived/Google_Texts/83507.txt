Liberals who can’t come to grips with the idea that President Obama has been a failure as the nation’s chief executive are taking their frustrations out on conservatives.

At least that’s how Bill O’Reilly sees it.

In his “Talking Points Memo” Tuesday, the Fox News host drew from a new Quinnipiac poll that shows 50 percent of Americans disapprove of the job Obama is doing.

“That has angered some of the president’s most ardent supporters who are standing by their man, believing he is misunderstood,” O’Reilly said. “But when asked what his accomplishments have been, there’s really only one thing the left can point to: Obamacare.”

O’Reilly said the president’s tenure “has been mediocre at best,” adding that Obama’s supporters “are furious that his administration is perceived as a failure.”

“The American economy is contracting and the chaos overseas is clear to everybody except Mr. Obama,” he added.

The left’s anger over this even extends to former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, O’Reilly said, as he noted a new CNN poll that shows most adults do not believe the probable 2016 Democratic presidential nominee is trustworthy.

“A year-and-a-half away from the election, many Americans are turning away from Secretary Clinton,” he said.

O’Reilly warned that the left will “launch vicious attacks on whomever the Republican nominee will be.”

“Committed liberals are angry that things are not going their way and that their standard bearers are losing respect,” he said. “The smear websites are already gearing up and if the right replies in kind, the presidential race of 2016 will be the ugliest in American history.

“Get ready.”
