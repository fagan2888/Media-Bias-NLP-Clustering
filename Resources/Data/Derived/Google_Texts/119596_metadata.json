Young, \u2018tiger for social justice,\u2019 dead at 92\n\nDr. Quentin Young provided medical care to the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., Mayor Harold Washington, the Beatles, Studs Terkel and Mike Royko. He ran a practice in Hyde Park, and his patients included Barack Obama.\n\nBut rather than the who\u2019s who of his clients, admirers are remembering him for the what\u2019s what. During a 60-year career, Dr. Young was a fierce advocate for quality health care for all and for the construction of Stroger Hospital.\n\nHe died Monday at his daughter\u2019s home in Berkeley, California. Dr. Young was 92.\n\n\u201cThe Cook County family has lost a giant in public health,\u201d said Dr. Claudia Fegan, executive medical director of the Cook County Health & Hospitals System.\n\n\u201cDr. Young was a radical, a rebel, a tiger for social justice,\u201d health consultant Michael Gelder said.\n\nIn 2008, when he declared Quentin Young Day in Illinois, Gov. Pat Quinn said his health adviser \u201cstood up for patients everywhere, advocating for what he believed to be right \u2013 even when it meant risk to his personal safety or his livelihood. . . . Time has consistently shown Quentin Young to be on the right side of history, and his advocacy has bettered his community and the health care industry as a whole.\u201d\n\nThe Hyde Park resident \u2014 who could safely be called an old lefty \u2014 frequently clashed with officials who brought him in to run things because of his expertise and reputation, only to discover he was hard to muzzle and control. He was steadfastly against U.S. participation in the Vietnam War, and pro-labor and civil rights. One of Dr. Young\u2019s favorite sayings was, \u201cEverybody In, Nobody Out,\u201d which became the title of his autobiography.\n\nIn the 1950s, he worked to desegregate Chicago hospitals. In the early 1960s, he helped start the Medical Committee for Human Rights, an arm of the civil rights movement. He marched in Selma and tended the injuries and illnesses that befell Freedom Riders in the South.\n\nLater, he was called before the House Un-American Activities Committee because the Medical Committee for Human Rights was viewed as a Communist-friendly group, said Margie Schaps, executive director of the Health & Medicine Policy Research Group, which Dr. Young chaired.\n\nIn 1966, when King was struck in the head by a projectile while marching through jeering white protesters in Marquette Park, it was Dr. Young who patched him up.\n\nAnd when police batons battered protesters during the 1968 Democratic National Convention, Dr. Young dressed the wounds. \u201cTo see such a disintegration of norms was very hard,\u201d he once said in an interview. During the Chicago Seven trial, he treated \u2018Yippee\u2019 Abbie Hoffman.\n\nHe chaired Cook County Hospital in the 1970s. His support of activist doctors who lobbied for unionization and improved patient care led to conflicts, Schaps said: \u201cQuentin was proud of this \u2014 he was fired three times, but he always got his job back.\u201d\n\nIn the early 1980s, he helped found the Health & Medicine Policy Research Group, which studies the impact of social factors on health, including education, income and environmental toxins.\n\nDuring Washington\u2019s administration, the mayor tapped Dr. Young to head the city Board of Health.\n\nAnd \u201cBeginning in the late 1980s, he was perhaps the nation\u2019s most eloquent and high-profile spokesperson for single-payer national health insurance,\u201d according to a statement from the group Physicians for a National Health Program.\n\nHis advocacy for a single-payer system left him at odds with Obama on how the Affordable Care Act turned out.\n\nIn 2001, at 78, Dr. Young trekked 167 miles across Illinois with Quinn \u2014 his patient \u2014 to promote health care initiatives.\n\nHe walked with a bounce, and people gravitated toward him because of his erudition, Gelder said. The physician could quote from the Greek classics and George Bernard Shaw.\n\nDr. Young loved talking with King so much that he tried to stretch their encounters. When King had a cold, \u201cI took a 15-minute house call and made it a three-hour afternoon with the master,\u201d he told the Chicago Sun-Times.\n\nHis mother and father were Eastern European immigrants. They met in North Carolina, where her family had a general store. \u201cThey were the only Jews for miles around,\u201d said his daughter, Polly. Young Quentin\u2019s future activism was stirred by witnessing the hard lives of African-American sharecroppers in North Carolina, she said. Later, his father earned a pharmacy degree from Fordham University. The Youngs settled in Hyde Park and his father sold real estate.\n\nDr. Young went to Hyde Park High School, the University of Chicago and Northwestern University\u2019s medical school.\n\nHe took his children on medical rounds, and to meetings, demonstrations and visits with King.\n\nIn the latter part of his career, he had a WBEZ radio show on health and medicine.\n\nIn 1960, he and his first wife, Jessie, divorced. He married Ruth Weaver in 1980. She died in 2007. He is survived by two more daughters, Nancy and Barbara; two sons, Ethan and Michael; his stepchildren, Karin and William Weaver; nine grandchildren and two step-great-grandchildren. A Chicago memorial is being planned.\n\nHe summarized his philosophy in his autobiography. \u201cFrom my adolescent years to the present, I\u2019ve never wavered in my belief in humanity\u2019s ability \u2013 and our collective responsibility \u2013 to bring about a more just and equitable social order. I\u2019ve always believed in humanity\u2019s potential to create a more caring society.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Dr. Quentin Young, a leader in the field of public health and longtime advocate for a single-payer national health-care system, died Tuesday at 92.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/chicagosuntimes/assets/images/favicons/mstile-310x150.png", "twitter": {"description": "Dr. Quentin Young, a leader in the field of public health and longtime advocate for a single-payer national health-care system, died Tuesday at 92.", "title": "Dr. Quentin D.
