(Mark Wilson/Getty Images)\n\nAfter a tumultuous week of party infighting and leadership stumbles, congressional Republicans are focused on calming their divided ranks in the months ahead, mostly by touting proposals that have wide backing within the GOP and shelving any big-ticket legislation for the rest of the year.\n\nComprehensive immigration reform, tax reform, tweaks to the federal health-care law \u2014 bipartisan deals on each are probably dead in the water for the rest of this Congress.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have 218 votes in the House for the big issues, so what else are we going to do?\u201d said Rep. Devin Nunes (Calif.), an ally of House Speaker John A. Boehner (Ohio). \u201cWe can do a few things on immigration and work on our principles, but in terms of real legislating, we\u2019re unable to get in a good negotiating position.\u201d\n\nAdded Frank Luntz, a Republican pollster who works closely with party leaders: \u201cIt is an acknowledgment of where they stand, where nothing can happen in divided government so we may essentially have the status quo. Significant immigration reform and fundamental tax reform are probably not going to happen.\u201d\n\nGOP brass in both chambers have shifted their focus to stability, looking to avoid intraparty drama, rally behind incumbents and build Republicans\u2019 ground game ahead of November\u2019s midterm elections, where they hope to be competitive in a slew of Senate races and hold on to the party\u2019s 17-seat House majority.\n\nIn that vein, championing a handful bills on job growth, energy and regulatory policy \u2014 all targeted at courting swing voters but unlikely to win Democratic support \u2014 has become a priority, with party leaders planning to spend months seeking consensus among Republicans and avoiding talks on controversial matters.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a natural progression,\u201d said Republican Vin Weber, a former Minnesota congressman. \u201cIf you\u2019re a Republican in Congress, you\u2019ve learned that when we shut down the government, we lose. Now that we\u2019ve had some success in avoiding another shutdown, our fortunes seem to be rising, so maybe we don\u2019t want big things to happen.\u201d\n\nRepublican leaders are also quite aware of voters\u2019 skepticism about the GOP\u2019s policies, and most believe that a softer sell, rather than an assertive attempt to pass major bills, is a smart play. A Washington Post-ABC News poll in January found that just 19 percent of Americans have confidence in congressional Republicans to make the right decisions for the country, while 80 percent do not.\n\nIn late January, House Republican leaders launched their small-ball strategy with a letter to President Obama after the State of the Union address, where they \u201cidentified four initial areas\u201d of potential agreement \u2014 citing job creation, natural-gas development, workplace rules and federally funded research but few items that could cause unrest with the party\u2019s powerful bloc of conservatives.\n\nIn an article published Thursday by the National Review, House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Va.) underscored the leadership\u2019s approach. \u201cWhile we will tackle many issues this year in Congress, we will focus on four key areas that demand our immediate attention,\u201d he wrote, once again talking up Republican proposals on job growth and energy, as well as on education and tax policy.\n\nLeft unmentioned by Cantor: brokering a compromise on immigration reform and adjusting the federal minimum wage \u2014 two issues at the top of the agenda for Obama and congressional Democrats.\n\nAt a news conference last week, Boehner blamed Obama for the partisan tensions and criticized him for not responding to the GOP\u2019s January letter. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen no response from the president \u2014 nothing,\u201d he said. \u201cIf the president won\u2019t work with us on these simple issues, who would ever expect that he\u2019d be able to work with us on the more complex issues that we face?\u201d\n\nThis month, Boehner also threw cold water on the prospect of an immigration-reform package landing on the president\u2019s desk this year.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s widespread doubt about whether this administration can be trusted to enforce our laws,\u201d Boehner said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s going to be difficult to move any immigration legislation until that changes.\u201d\n\nThis development on Capitol Hill \u2014 rarely articulated as an orchestrated slowdown beyond private huddles \u2014 is part of a push by GOP leaders to avoid sensational headlines and headaches. For example, many of them, including Boehner, would like to see aspects of immigration reform enacted. But because of party dynamics, they know it\u2019s unlikely \u2014 and if pursued with any seriousness this spring, it could lead to a tea party rebellion.\n\nAt the House GOP\u2019s annual retreat in January, Republicans spent most sessions discussing how to frame the party\u2019s pitch to middle-class voters and get through the debate over suspending the debt ceiling. Influential voices, such as Boehner and Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), devoted their speeches to the necessity of a united front and pressuring the president to support the Keystone XL pipeline, among other issues that could be helpful on the campaign trail.\n\nThe appetite there for anything resembling a grand bargain on immigration, taxes or health-care reform was nonexistent, according to several aides present, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the meetings were confidential.\n\nOn health care, Republicans will offer their own wholesale substitute for the Affordable Care Act in the spring or summer, making full repeal of the law a keystone of their election-year message.\n\nRepublican operatives said the GOP\u2019s slowing pace is unsurprising, given the party\u2019s internal squabbles and the usual pattern ahead of midterm elections, a period that has rarely provided moments for ambitious bipartisan legislating.\n\n\u201cThere is clearly a desire among Republicans in Congress to move forward, and everyone is working through where they could find potentially find consensus,\u201d said David Winston, a Republican strategist who advises Boehner. \u201cBut you\u2019ve got to see where the differences are and try to resolve them, while staying focused on offering an alternative.\u201d\n\nIn the meantime, avoiding unruly theatrics and trying to package the GOP as a ready-to-govern party is the leadership\u2019s chief concern.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to make ourselves the story,\u201d Boehner said in a speech to his colleagues Tuesday, before moving to pass a \u201cclean\u201d debt-ceiling extension \u2014 one without strings attached. A day later, as Senate Republicans openly battled during an hour-long vote on that legislation, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) echoed Boehner in a terse cloakroom talk during which he criticized the discord.\n\nDemocrats have seized on Republicans\u2019 hesitancy to pursue hot-button issues, arguing that it is evidence of crippling division. On Friday, Vice President Biden, speaking at House Democrats\u2019 retreat in Cambridge, Md., said, \u201cThere isn\u2019t a Republican Party.\u201d\n\n\u201cBetween now and November is three political lifetimes,\u201d Biden said. \u201cThe American people are where we are. And let\u2019s go out and make every single effort not just to defend, but to aggressively push our agenda.\u201d\n\nBut with the federal government\u2019s borrowing authority extended through next year and a budget agreement already reached, many Republicans are comfortable with the turn toward campaigning and bills designed to bolster GOP candidates.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s over, it\u2019s finished after the debt ceiling,\u201d Nunes said. \u201cIn the House, we\u2019ve got 30 guys who don\u2019t want to support anything, ever, unless it balances the budget next year.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "GOP leaders are looking to build their ground game ahead of elections and avoid intraparty drama.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/costareports", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "GOP leaders are looking to build their ground game ahead of elections and avoid intraparty drama.", "title": "Divided congressional Republicans to shelve big-ticket legislation and focus on unity ahead of elections,", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/congressional-republicans-focused-on-calming-their-divided-ranks/2014/02/17/0210bcc2-9599-11e3-8461-8a24c7bf0653_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2014/02/17/National-Politics/Images/465606729.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@costareports"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/congressional-republicans-focused-on-calming-their-divided-ranks/2014/02/17/0210bcc2-9599-11e3-8461-8a24c7bf0653_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "house republicans, devin nunes, nunes, boehner, House Republican infighting, House Republican rivalries, House GOP agenda, Vin Weber, congressional GOP fortunes, Eric Cantor National Review, GOP House legislative agenda, House GOP debt ceiling, debt ceiling battle,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/costareports"}, "news_keywords": "house republicans, devin nunes, nunes, boehner, House Republican infighting, House Republican rivalries, House GOP agenda, Vin Weber, congressional GOP fortunes, Eric Cantor National Review, GOP House legislative agenda, House GOP debt ceiling, debt ceiling battle,", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "eomportal-uuid": "0210bcc2-9599-11e3-8461-8a24c7bf0653"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc529\"", "article_summary": "Comprehensive immigration reform, tax reform, tweaks to the federal health-care law \u2014 bipartisan deals on each are probably dead in the water for the rest of this Congress.\nHouse Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) speaks to the media after attending the weekly House Republican conference at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 28, 2014.\nFor example, many of them, including Boehner, would like to see aspects of immigration reform enacted.\nLeft unmentioned by Cantor: brokering a compromise on immigration reform and adjusting the federal minimum wage \u2014 two issues at the top of the agenda for Obama and congressional Democrats.\n(Mark Wilson/Getty Images)After a tumultuous week of party infighting and leadership stumbles, congressional Republicans are focused on calming their divided ranks in the months ahead, mostly by touting proposals that have wide backing within the GOP and shelving any big-ticket legislation for the rest of the year."}
