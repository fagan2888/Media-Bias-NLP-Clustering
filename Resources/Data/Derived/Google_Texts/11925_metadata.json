She practiced there for two years before joining her husband \u2013 Gerry, also a Nigeria native \u2013 in Oregon, where he was working for Metro. (He still works there, as a project manager.)\n\nBut before she could practice in the United States, Uba had to leave Gerry and her children for four years, completing an internship at Howard University Hospital in Washington, D.C. and a residency at St. Clare's Hospital (now Ellis Hospital) in Schenectady, N.Y.\n\nAt a ribbon-cutting ceremony on Saturday afternoon, Uba became emotional when she thanked her family for persevering through her absence.\n\n\"I just was not there for them because I had to do this to go get educated,\" Uba said. \"They understood that I had to do this, not just for me but for them as well.\"\n\nUba previously worked at Tuality Hospital and with Providence Medical Group, and said many of her patients have followed her to her new location. Many of them, Uba said, come from underserved communities, and she said the timing was right for opening Health First Family Medicine, since many people newly insured under the Affordable Care Act are looking for a doctor. She added that she likes the independence and the personal responsibility that comes with owning her own clinic.\n\nShe also continues to support the community in her small Nigerian village, organizing efforts to bring medical equipment and care to people in need there.\n\nAttendees at the ribbon-cutting ceremony included Metro Council President and former Hillsboro Mayor Tom Hughes, current Hillsboro Mayor Jerry Willey, Washington County Commissioner Dick Schouten and Hillsboro Chamber of Commerce President Deanna Palm.\n\n-- Luke Hammill", "article_metadata": {"article_author": "Luke Hammill | The Oregonian/OregonLive", "medium": "news", "news_keywords": "angela uba,health first family medicine", "title": "Dr. Angela Uba's long journey from Nigeria ends at her new Hillsboro health clinic", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Dr. Angela Uba\\u0027s long journey from Nigeria ends at her new Hillsboro health clinic\", \"link\": \"http://www.oregonlive.com/hillsboro/index.ssf/2014/06/dr_angela_ubas_long_journey_fr.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://imgick.oregonlive.com/home/olive-media/width620/img/hillsboro_news/photo/15172067-standard.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"13157527\", \"pub_date\": \"2014-06-10T16:36:37Z\", \"author\": \"Luke Hammill | The Oregonian/OregonLive\", \"tags\": [\"@argus\",\"@breaking-news\",\"@hillsboro\",\"@hp-top-stories\",\"@washington-county\",\"angela uba\",\"health first family medicine\"] }", "twitter": {"site": "@oregonlive", "image": "http://media.oregonlive.com/hillsboro_news/photo/15172067-thumb_square_large.jpg", "description": "The clinic, behind the Reedville Caf&#233; at the corner of Cornelius Pass Road and Tualatin Valley Highway, represents the culmination of a long journey for Uba.", "card": "summary", "creator": "@lucashammill"}, "article_date_updated": "Tuesday, June 10, 2014,  9:27 PM", "parsely-metadata": "{\"image_url\": \"http://media.oregonlive.com/hillsboro_news/photo/health-first-family-medicine-155aad8f19f7c1a4.jpg\", \"author_name\": \"hammily-l\", \"author_nickname\": \"Luke Hammill | The Oregonian/OregonLive\", \"author_id\": \"11038138\", \"source_blog_name\": \"Hillsboro News\", \"source_blog_url\": \"http://www.oregonlive.com/hillsboro/index.ssf/\", \"sponsored_content\": \"0\" }", "og": {"site_name": "OregonLive.com", "description": "The clinic, behind the Reedville Caf&#233; at the corner of Cornelius Pass Road and Tualatin Valley Highway, represents the culmination of a long journey for Uba.", "title": "Dr. Angela Uba's long journey from Nigeria ends at her new Hillsboro health clinic", "url": "http://www.oregonlive.com/hillsboro/index.ssf/2014/06/dr_angela_ubas_long_journey_fr.html", "image": "http://media.oregonlive.com/design/alpha/img/logo_olive.gif", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "OregonLive.com", "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Tuesday, June 10, 2014,  9:36 AM", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "Description": "The clinic, behind the Reedville Caf&#233; at the corner of Cornelius Pass Road and Tualatin Valley Highway, represents the culmination of a long journey for Uba."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9d95\"", "article_summary": "She attended medical school in her native Nigeria, graduating from the University of Jos' School of Medicine in 1985.\nDr. Angela Uba chose her location wisely \u2013 her new primary care clinic, Health First Family Medicine, is across the street from the future South Hillsboro development, where 25,000 people are expected to move in the coming years.\nThe clinic, behind the Reedville Caf\u00e9 at the corner of Cornelius Pass Road and Tualatin Valley Highway, represents the culmination of a long journey for Uba.\nAttendees at the ribbon-cutting ceremony included Metro Council President and former Hillsboro Mayor Tom Hughes, current Hillsboro Mayor Jerry Willey, Washington County Commissioner Dick Schouten and Hillsboro Chamber of Commerce President Deanna Palm.\nShe practiced there for two years before joining her husband \u2013 Gerry, also a Nigeria native \u2013 in Oregon, where he was working for Metro."}
