(Photo courtesy of Timmy Global Health) (Photo courtesy of Timmy Global Health)\n\nDr. Mercy Obeime has for nearly two decades been medical director of the SYMPAQ Clinic in Garfield Park, which serves low-income patients.\n\n\n\nSince 2004, Obeime, 52, has also been taking annual medical mission trips to impoverished countries, starting with her native Nigeria, and now\u2014via a merger of her foundation with Timmy Global Health\u2014to Ecuador, Guatemala and others.\n\n\n\nShe spoke about how those trips help her treat patients in the United States; how Obamacare is affecting her practice; and even how, as a teenager, she aspired to be a nun.\n\nWhy do you think doing medical service overseas is helpful for your work here?\n\nOne of the first things I noticed was, dealing with poor patients like I have here was not a unique problem. There are certain behaviors that you could actually call poverty behaviors; the things that people do because they are in a constant mode of insecurity is pretty universal.\n\n\n\nCan you give examples?\n\n\n\nThey are terrified of Westernized medicine, because they don\u2019t really understand it. The health literacy is so low. So you have to build trust more than tell them about facts.\n\n\n\nHere in America, I\u2019m trying to tell a patient, \u201cYou have high blood pressure, and I want you to take medicine EVERY DAY, because that\u2019s the way you\u2019re going to control this blood pressure.\u201d But the patient is like, \u201cI don\u2019t feel anything. If I don\u2019t feel anything, why are you telling me I need to take medication?\u201d That\u2019s the health illiteracy.\n\n\n\nBecause [if I\u2019m poor], I\u2019m worrying about how I\u2019m going to eat, and you\u2019re telling me I have to come and see somebody to get this medicine I don\u2019t think I need. We have patients who come to me, because they have pain, but they haven\u2019t seen their doctor about their diabetes or hypertension, and I tell them, \u201cI\u2019m not giving you any more pain medicine; you need to go see your doctor. The reason for your pain is, your diabetes is out of control and your nerves are dead. So giving you [pain] medicine is not it.\u201d And they look at me and say, \u201cOh, she\u2019s so mean!\u201d\n\n\n\nNow that Obamacare and the Healthy Indiana Plan are expanding insurance coverage, is that changing things at your health center?\n\n\n\nJust because you gave people a card doesn\u2019t mean that they\u2019re going to use it, doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re going to sign up, doesn\u2019t mean that they will follow through.\n\n\n\nThere\u2019s a woman I saw today who wasn\u2019t taking her medicine. Because she kept showing up in the emergency room, they sent her back to us. She just doesn\u2019t see [that] I can\u2019t give her pain medicine and not worry about whether she has cancer or whether she has pancreatitis. She was yelling at me.\n\n\n\nSo we are going to get her to the point where she understands that you can\u2019t just show up every day and say, \u201cI don\u2019t have insurance.\u201d Now you have insurance [via HIP 2.0], and we know where you are and where you can go. If you go to Community [Health Network], they are going to say, \u201cOh, you have insurance, and you\u2019ve been to St. Francis; you need to go back there.\u201d Before, [patients] would say, \u201cI have no insurance; [doctors] don\u2019t want to see me,\u201d and [the hospitals] couldn\u2019t argue about that.\n\n\n\nIs there still a need for your health center then?\n\n\n\nThe reason we have this center still open and we still take care of the underserved is because of faith and because the sisters [the Franciscan nuns who oversee Franciscan St. Francis hospitals] want to take care of the people who fall off the boat. Businesswise, our accountants have said, there\u2019s no reason for this place to be open because we could get paying patients in here and not have to deal with [needier patients].\n\n\n\nIs faith a big motivator for you? If so, why?\n\n\n\nYes. I wanted to be a nun until I was 16. And then I decided, I\u2019m not even Catholic, and I left the Catholic church. I just went to my friends\u2019 [non-denominational] churches. But when I was getting married, I decided I should come back.\n\n\n\nIf I looked at someone and said, \u201cYou know what, God tells me that this person cannot really do any better, that we need to adopt them and take care of all of their needs because God tells us we are supposed to take care of the poor,\u201d I\u2019m doing that because of my faith.\n\n\n\nWhen I look at it, God gives us responsibilities. And even though my life is crazy, I like the job that God gives me, because I like the side that I am on, most of the time.\n\n\n\nClick here for other interviews.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Obeime, second from left, tries to de-mystify Western medicine for patients in other countries.\u00a0(Photo courtesy of Timmy Global Health) Dr. Mercy Obeime has for nearly two decades been medical director of the SYMPAQ Clinic in Garfield Park, which serves low-income patients.
