Analyzing only oral argument transcripts, CourtCast scores the case on a variety of metrics, including the justices\u2019 sentiments, word counts and interruptions.\n\nMore Politics\n\nUnless our article launches CourtCast\u2019s profile into the stratosphere, it\u2019s probably safe to say that the reigning interpreter of Supreme Court arguments is NPR\u2019s Nina Totenberg. Totenberg doesn\u2019t just report on the proceedings \u2014 she\u2019s famous for her lively readings of the transcripts.\n\nTotenberg\u2019s analysis comes in two steps. First, after watching a day\u2019s arguments, she decides which key moments to include in her reporting. This is what all journalists do. But she then goes the extra step of re-creating \u2014 with tone, pacing and volume \u2014 the proceedings to bring them to life for her listeners.\n\nWe thought it would be instructive to break down audio of Totenberg\u2019s reporting alongside the CourtCast interpretation of the same argument. Think of it as Kasparov vs. Deep Blue, but somehow wonkier.\n\nWe chose King v. Burwell, the recent high-profile case that calls into question whether the federal government can subsidize health insurance for people in states that choose not to set up their own insurance exchanges. The King side is arguing against the Affordable Care Act; Burwell \u2014 the head of Health and Human Services \u2014 is the respondent.\n\nFirst, here is Nina Totenberg\u2019s full piece that aired on All Things Considered. You don\u2019t have to stop and listen to the full six minutes right now, but it\u2019s a great piece of legal journalism:\n\n\u201cThe Supreme Court justices were sharply divided today during a sometimes emotional argument over the fate of President Obama\u2019s health care law\u2026\u201d\n\nAnd below is a chart created by CourtCast. We discuss the meaning of this chart more in our companion article, but here\u2019s the gist: The bigger the bar, the worse it is for that side. (For example, the liberal Justice Stephen Breyer spoke a lot, and in a way that was detrimental to the petitioner, King. No surprise there.)\n\nBelow, we break down three key sections from Totenberg\u2019s piece and see whether the CourtCast algorithm agrees.\n\nStumped By The Swing Votes\n\nTotenberg sets the case up as hinging on two swing votes:\n\n\u201cBy the end of the argument, it was clear that the outcome will almost certainly be determined\u2026\u201d\n\nYou can see this in the CourtCast chart as well. Compared to full-throated liberals like Ginsburg and Breyer, neither Roberts nor Kennedy offered many clues when it came to word count. Let\u2019s consider both Totenberg and CourtCast stumped on this front.\n\nScalia Rides To The Rescue\n\nWe pick up Totenberg\u2019s piece in a section where she mimics Kennedy (a swing vote) critically questioning King\u2019s lawyer:\n\n\u201cThat is a form of coercion, so it seems to me there\u2019s a serious constitutional problem if we accept your argument\u2026\u201d\n\nIn this stretch, we see Totenberg highlight Kennedy\u2019s willingness to probe both sides of the argument \u2014 and conservative Scalia\u2019s willingness to \u201cjump in\u201d and help King. No surprise, the CourtCast data\u2019s \u201cinterruption\u201d index for Scalia also shows him heavily skewed against Burwell.\n\nSentiment Is Hard To Interpret\n\nHere\u2019s a stretch where the Totenberg and CourtCast interpretations don\u2019t seem to match up. Justice Ginsburg is considered a safe bet to rule in favor of Burwell and uphold the Affordable Care Act. Totenberg reflects this in her reading of a skeptical Ginsburg question to King:\n\n\u201cJustice Ginsburg, however, pointed to what she called the familiar patterns of federal aid. Here\u2019s a grant \u2014 take it or leave it \u2014 or a pattern like this, which says to a state, \u2018you can have your program if you want it, and if you don\u2019t,\u2019 the fallback is a federal program\u2026\u201d\n\nInterestingly, CourtCast gives Ginsburg a \u201csentiment\u201d score that\u2019s pro-King \u2014 the opposite direction \u2014 albeit slightly. This is not to say that CourtCast thinks Ginsburg won\u2019t vote with the liberal bloc \u2014 check out how high she scores in Burwell\u2019s favor under \u201cword count\u201d and \u201cinterruptions\u201d \u2014 but it does illustrate how a straight textual analysis can differ from a reporter\u2019s interpretation.\n\nTotenberg has chosen to characterize Ginsburg as a safe liberal vote. This is a decision based on history and a reporter\u2019s sense of how one justice reliably votes. The cold, raw data on sentiment is a little noisier.\n\nOne More For Good Measure\n\nThe three examples above are the most instructive for our purposes, but we can\u2019t let a piece about Nina Totenberg go by without highlighting another moment from her piece on King v. Burwell. Here it is, one of our favorite examples of Totenberg interpretation. Every reporter wrote about this moment of levity, but only she brought it to life:\n\n\u201cJustice Scalia \u2013 you really think Congress is just going to sit there while all these disastrous consequences ensue? How often\u2026\u201d\n\nAll hail Nina Totenberg.\n\nWhether you prefer tuning in to NPR or staring at a chart, it\u2019s clear that the nature of legal interpretation is in flux. Totenberg, like any dispassionate journalist, wisely ends her piece by saying \u201cnobody was making any predictions.\u201d\n\nThat may be technically true \u2014 nobody was \u2014 but CourtCast gave it its best algorithmic shot. The program predicts, with 61 percent confidence, that King will fail and the Affordable Care Act will be upheld.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "FiveThirtyEight", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "FiveThirtyEight", "description": "In a recent piece here at FiveThirtyEight, one of us (it was Ollie) wrote about CourtCast, an effort to predict Supreme Court decisions by algorithm.
