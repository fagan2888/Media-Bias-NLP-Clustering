Every year, his office on N. 13th Street in Allentown is bombarded with last minute filers, expecting to have their documents submitted on time.\n\nThe accountant said one item in particular is causing extra anxiety for his clients this year.\n\n\"Everyone is pointing at the health care issues. I think the stressful thing about that, is people don't understand what is involved with it,\" Koscinski.\n\nOverall, Koscinski said it's been more worry than trouble.\n\nBut, he anticipates more confusion surrounding the Affordable Care Act next season.\n\nBack to this year, he said some filers, especially those with investment earnings, may want to consider applying for an extension.\n\nHe also encourages taxpayers to start early in 2016.\n\n\"Be more on top of it next year,\" Koscinski said.\n\nHe said that alone should relieve quite a bit of stress.\n\nBut for those who didn't heed that advice this year, Allentown's Massage Envy Spa is offering a helping hand.\n\nThe business will provide free 10 to 15 minute chair massages at H&R Block on Hamilton Blvd in Trexlertown on Monday.\n\n\n\nThey anticipate focusing on specific stress areas.\n\n\n\n\"Problem areas are definitely going to be in the back and shoulders and the neck. A lot of tension arises in those areas,\" said Andrea Cole, manager at Massage Envy Spa.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"ib-analytics": "data", "description": "If the thought of doing your taxes is taxing on you, you're not alone..", "generator": "ibPublish 2", "author": "WFMZ", "og": {"site_name": "WFMZ", "description": "If the thought of doing your taxes is taxing on you, you're not alone..", "title": "Don't let tax season stress you out", "url": "http://www.wfmz.com/news/news-regional-lehighvalley/dont-let-tax-season-stress-you-out/32309976", "image": "http://www.wfmz.com/image/view/-/32309980/medRes/1/-/maxh/640/maxw/640/-/u7qjw2/-/Don-t-let-tax-season-stress-you-out.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.wfmz.com/news/news-regional-lehighvalley/dont-let-tax-season-stress-you-out/32309976", "site": "@69News", "card": "summary"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "f3f5a5b07121d3a312bef3c0f587be3c"}, "fb": {"app_id": 236814379695677}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/69wfmz"}, "keywords": "taxes, tax, tax season, April 15,", "google-site-verification": "u5CmHU5LE-cghha2J2mHZ5UMDooKP2cImr15p1R4Cgg", "news_keywords": "taxes, tax, tax season, April 15,"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2b8c\"", "article_summary": "Don't let tax season stress you outIf the thought of doing your taxes is taxing on you, you're not alone.\nBut for those who didn't heed that advice this year, Allentown's Massage Envy Spa is offering a helping hand.\nA lot of tension arises in those areas,\" said Andrea Cole, manager at Massage Envy Spa.\nEvery year, his office on N. 13th Street in Allentown is bombarded with last minute filers, expecting to have their documents submitted on time.\n\"They're stressed,\" said accountant Bill Koscinski, describing last minute filers coming through his office."}
