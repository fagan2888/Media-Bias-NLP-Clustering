It\u2019s also a disturbingly familiar one.\n\nIn a series of interviews with female survivors of sexual violence at Patrick Henry College, Feldman uncovered an institutional pattern of victim-blaming and impunity for perpetrators that was grounded in the school\u2019s strict adherence to evangelical doctrine, specifically its \u201cgender complementarian\u201d norms and toxic purity culture.\n\nThough generally viewed as a safe haven for young people with an evangelical Christian worldview, Patrick Henry College turned out to be a very dangerous place to be a survivor of sexual assault. It is, in other words, much like everywhere else in this country.\n\nEvangelical Christianity makes visible \u2014 through purity pledges and doctrine assigning women the role of man\u2019s \u201chelpmate\u201d \u2014 the norms and expectations about female virginity and subservience that so often remain hidden in the secular world. While it may be tempting to draw a red line around Christian fundamentalist views on gender and sexuality to distinguish them from supposedly evolved \u201csecular\u201d culture, there is considerable, uncomfortable overlap between the two.\n\nHere are four ways \u201csecular\u201d American culture mirrors Christian purity culture.\n\nRepublicans are fighting to keep women from accessing birth control.\n\nWhether it\u2019s Rush Limbaugh calling women who take birth control \u201csluts\u201d or Mike Huckabee mansplaining why it\u2019s actually \u201cempowering\u201d to deny women insurance coverage for contraception, one point remains clear: Conservatives want to enshrine religiously defined norms about sexuality into law.\n\nRepublicans who oppose the Affordable Care Act have made contraceptive coverage a main point of attack against the policy because ensuring women have affordable and reliable access to birth control means accepting \u2014 and culturally and institutionally sanctioning \u2014 women\u2019s ability to control their own fertility and sexuality. (Women, of course, take birth control for reasons other than avoiding pregnancy, but you will notice that these \u201cother\u201d women never factor into conservatives\u2019 tirades against the evils of contraception.)\n\nBut empowering women to control their sexuality and separate sex from pregnancy and childbearing is a violation of the conservative view of sex \u2014 which is about reproduction and male entitlement.\n\nEnabling women to make these choices also ensures they have equal access to opportunities in education and work, which also goes against conservative views about women\u2019s place in the home. As I have previously noted, a recent review of more than 66 studies conducted over three decades reveals that a woman\u2019s ability to control her fertility impacts much more than just if and when she will have a child; contraception plays a significant role in shaping women\u2019s financial, professional and emotional lives.\n\nAccording to Adam Sonfield, the lead author of the review from the Guttmacher Institute, \u201cThe scientific evidence strongly confirms what has long been obvious to women. Contraceptive use, and the ensuing ability to decide whether and when to have children, is linked to a host of benefits for themselves, the quality of their relationships, and the well-being of their children.\u201d\n\nMainstream news outlets are still running editorials chastising women for having sex before marriage.\n\nSusan Patton is a joke, but she\u2019s not the only person arguing in mainstream publications that women who have sex outside of marriage are setting themselves up for disaster and heartbreak. (Hi, Ross Douthat!)\n\nIn an opinion piece for the Wall Street Journal last week, Patton warned single women, \u201cThe grandmotherly message of yesterday is still true today: Men won\u2019t buy the cow if the milk is free.\u201d\n\nThis is purity culture passed off as \u201ccommonsense\u201d wisdom, which was published in a \u201cserious\u201d and secular paper.
