Those hospitals include the following:\n\nInova Fairfax Hospital;\n\nMedStar Georgetown University Hospital;\n\nMedStar Washington Hospital;\n\nProvidence Hospital;\n\nUnited Medical Center;\n\nVirginia Hospital Center-Arlington.\n\nThe rest ranked below average overall; a few hospitals ranked well in individual categories, but Consumer Reports said there weren\u2019t enough patients to be statistically significant.\n\nConsumer Reports statistics on hospital infections in the DC area\n\nConsumer Reports says that according to statistics from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, about 648,000 people in the U.S. get infections in the hospital, and about 75,000 die. That includes 60,000 and 290,000 patients who contract MRSA and C. diff, respectively, of whom 8,000 and 27,000 die.\n\n\u201cHospitals can be hot spots for infections and can sometimes amplify spread,\u201d Dr. Tom Frieden, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, tells Consumer Reports.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve reached the point where patients are dying of infections in hospitals that we have no antibiotics to treat,\u201d says Dr. Arjun Srinivasan, who is in charge of the CDC\u2019s efforts against the spread of hospital-acquired infections.\n\nDoris Peter, the director of Consumer Reports\u2019 Health Ratings Center, tells WTOP that only 6 percent of hospitals nationwide received one of the two highest rankings in avoiding MRSA and C. diff infections, which she calls in the report \u201ca red flag that a hospital isn\u2019t following the best practices in preventing infections and prescribing antibiotics.\u201d\n\nShe adds that even hospitals with good reputations, such as Johns Hopkins, in Baltimore, didn\u2019t fare very well.\n\n\u201cWe were focusing very narrowly on performance on these particular infections. It is purely based on data that has been reported to the government \u2014 it is not based on reputation,\u201d Peter says.\n\nConsumer Reports suggests that hospital patients need to question the use of antibiotics \u2014 their overprescription is a prime factor in the spread of these so-called \u201csuperbugs\u201d \u2014 as well as heartburn drugs, which can suppress the acid that keeps bugs in check. They also say you should insist on inspecting your hospital room and demand it be clean, and even bring your own wipes for bed rails, doorknobs and other surfaces.\n\nOther tips include asking every day whether any tubes can be removed, and requesting the use of an electronic device rather than a regular razor if you need to be shaved.\n\nHospitals are reportedly beginning to discharge patients sooner than they otherwise would, on the grounds that it keeps them safer from possible infections, and Peter says it\u2019s a sound principle.\n\n\u201cThe longer you are there, the more likely you will pick something up. So stay out or get out early.\u201d\n\nWTOP\u2019s Paula Wolfson contributed to this report.\n\nFollow @WTOP on Twitter and WTOP on Facebook.\n\n\u00a9 2015 WTOP.
