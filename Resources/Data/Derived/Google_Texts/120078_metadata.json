So the main way this differs from previous years is that we have strong staffers in place early.\u201d\n\nThe early staffing also may reflect beliefs that the 2016 campaign season in Missouri will largely be driven by the contests for governor and the U.S. Senate, and not by the presidential battle.\n\nMissouri Democrats appear to be seeking to duplicate their successful 2012 formula, in which the party was able to separate the statewide races \u2013 which Democrats largely won \u2013 from the presidential contest, which saw Republican Mitt Romney handily carry Missouri.\n\nThe Missouri Republican Party, meanwhile, is seeking to expand on its 2014 success in winning huge majorities in the state House and Senate. Republican legislative leaders have been using those numbers lately to overrule the veto pen of Gov. Jay Nixon, a Democrat.\n\nThe state GOP also appears to be emerging from several months of internal turmoil, prompted by the Feb. 26 suicide of then-state Auditor Tom Schweich, a Republican candidate for governor.\n\nSchweich had been at odds with party chairman John Hancock for months before the internal party election, held just days before Schweich killed himself. Some of the auditor\u2019s allies \u2013 notably former U.S. Sen. John C. Danforth, R-Mo. \u2013 sought to place some of the blame on Hancock.\n\nThat furor appears to have died down with the release of the police report indicating that Schweich had been emotionally troubled for some time and suffered from health problems. So far, Hancock is staying on.\n\nHancock has said his focus is on retiring the party\u2019s debt, which he has estimated at about $100,000, and putting the state GOP on better financial footing for next year\u2019s contests. He also is promising to revamp and reinvigorate the party\u2019s get-out-the-vote operations.\n\nNational Republican aid is expected to pour in on behalf of U.S. Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Mo. For now, Blunt appears to be focused on his official duties. In recent weeks, he has retooled his Senate staff, which for the most part can\u2019t be involved in his campaign.\n\nRole of outside groups\n\nDave Robertson, a political science professor at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, said a key question will be how large a role is played by outside groups in the state\u2019s contests for U.S. Senate and governor.\n\nAlthough independent campaign groups, often called Super PACs, have become major players in presidential contests in the past decade, Robertson predicts they\u2019ll jump into Missouri\u2019s 2016 contests for the U.S. Senate and governor.\n\nBoth posts are pivotal to the plans of the national parties, Robertson said. Control of the U.S. Senate in 2016 could hinge on the outcome in Missouri, he said. And governorships have become key cogs in the national battles over implementation of various national initiatives, such as President Barack Obama Affordable Care Act that revamps health-insurance coverage.\n\n\u201cRepublicans have been able to really confound the Obama administration\u2019\u2019 by taking control of state legislatures and electing a majority of the governors, Robertson said.\n\nDemocrats, meanwhile, are expected to push back by pouring more money into state contests and legislative races.\n\nThat\u2019s where the state parties will fit in, Robertson said, because they can be indispensable in campaign coordination in state and regional contests, and in overseeing grassroot organizing.\n\nMoney matters\n\nBut in Missouri, anyway, the state Republican and Democratic parties have less money than they used to have to finance such operations. When campaign-donation limits were in effect, from 1995-2008, donors gave the state parties the excess sums that couldn\u2019t go directly to the candidates.\n\nBut since donation limits were removed in 2008, most of the major campaign dollars in the state now flow directly to the candidates. The lack of limits hasn\u2019t helped the state parties.\n\nThe parties\u2019 latest state campaign finance reports illustrate their tight finances. The state GOP reported $25,304 in the bank as of March 31, while the Missouri Democratic Party had $66,994 on hand. A decade ago, both parties routinely reported bank accounts in the six figures.\n\n(Both state parties have separate campaign bank accounts reported to the Federal Election Committee. That money can be used to help congressional candidates, while the money on their state reports cannot, because federal and state campaign-finance rules differ.)\n\nOne notable point in the state reports is that the Missouri Democratic Party had outspent the state GOP by about 5-to-1 so far this year, as part of the spending ramp-up for 2016. Hancock expects the Missouri Republican to soon catch up.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Politics & Issues", "description": "Embattled and accused of being irrelevant, Missouri\u2019s two major political parties are beefing up their operations nonetheless in preparation for next year", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://news.stlpublicradio.org/post/missouri-political-parties-retool-2016-they-seek-recover-recent-losses", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/kwmu/files/styles/medium/public/201505/6261650491_0cd6c701bb_b.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Embattled and accused of being irrelevant, Missouri\u2019s two major political parties are beefing up their operations nonetheless in preparation for next year", "title": "Missouri political parties retool for 2016 as they seek to recover from recent losses"}, "story_id": 405730857, "twitter": {"site": "@stlpublicradio", "card": "summary", "creator": "@jmannies"}, "author": "Jo Mannies", "org_id": 0, "dc": {"title": "Missouri political parties retool for 2016 as they seek to recover from recent losses"}, "nid": 45701, "datePublished": "2015-05-10", "keywords": "Missouri Republican Party, Missouri Democratic Party", "wordCount": 945, "has_audio": 0, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd39d9\"", "article_summary": "The state GOP reported $25,304 in the bank as of March 31, while the Missouri Democratic Party had $66,994 on hand.\nMoney mattersBut in Missouri, anyway, the state Republican and Democratic parties have less money than they used to have to finance such operations.\nWhen campaign-donation limits were in effect, from 1995-2008, donors gave the state parties the excess sums that couldn\u2019t go directly to the candidates.\nThe Missouri Republican Party, meanwhile, is seeking to expand on its 2014 success in winning huge majorities in the state House and Senate.\nDemocrats, meanwhile, are expected to push back by pouring more money into state contests and legislative races."}
