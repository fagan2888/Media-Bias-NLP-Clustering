Former Colorado State and Broncos running back Kapri Bibbs will finally get his shot Sunday versus Cleveland. The Broncos announced they activated Bibbs Saturday and waived tight end Richard Gordon.

Bibbs had spent the first five games on Denver’s practice squad, but with Juwan Thompson (hamstring) questionable for Sunday’s game Bibbs was needed to be the third running back.

“I told them not to give me a chance because if I get one I’ll do everything in my power to make sure that I stay on this roster,” Bibbs said Thursday.

The 5-foot-11, 203 pound speed back said he played on all of the starting special units in place of Thompson in practice all week.

Bibbs, who will wear no. 35, signed with the Broncos as a 2014 college free agent. He spent the first four weeks of his rookie season on the active roster, but has not appeared in a regular season game.

He only spent one year at CSU, but broke the Rams’ single-season record for rushing yards (1,741) and touchdowns (31) in 2013.

Bibbs has 25, carries 111 rushing yards and three touchdowns in seven Broncos preseason games over the last two seasons.

Gordon’s stay in Denver only lasted three days. He was signed Wednesday in place of Mitchell Henry to be a third tight end.

The Broncos will play Sunday with Owen Daniels and Virgil Green as their only two tight ends.
