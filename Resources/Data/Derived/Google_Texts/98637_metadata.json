But the presidential candidates have uttered little about science policy\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been conspicuous by its absence,\u201d says Dr. Peter J. Hotez, Dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine.\n\nNonetheless, the Republican frontrunner, Donald Trump, has made public remarks that give voters a glimpse into what some of his scientific policies might be. We asked some science and policy experts to discuss Trump\u2019s stances, and what that could mean for Americans in the future.\n\nGo slow on climate action: Trump has tweeted that climate change is a Chinese-driven hoax, though he later called the Tweet a joke. In an interview with Fox and Friends, he called climate change \u201cjust a very, very expensive form of tax\u201d and \u201cvery hard on business.\u201d\n\nSizing up the science: \u201cThere\u2019s been a misperception that either you get a good economy or you protect the environment,\u201d says Peter LaPuma, an associate professor in the Milken Institute School of Public Health at George Washington University.\n\nLaPuma, who worked as a sustainable energy consultant for Booz Allen Hamilton before joining George Washington, says many companies have found that sustainable practices actually boost their bottom lines. For example, IT companies like Apple have begun using renewable energy to power their data centers, a switch that often saves money because the cost of energy sources like solar has dropped so much.\n\nImmediate action to combat climate change has immediate benefits, according to LaPuma. \u201cClimate change is not just polar bears 100 years from now,\u201d he says. Replacing a coal-fired power plant with a solar farm can benefit health immediately, as well as clearing the air for better views of the country\u2019s natural landscape.\n\nCut the EPA: Trump has said he would cut funding for the Environmental Protection Agency and return environmental protection responsibilities to the states. He claims the agency hurts business, and in an interview with The Wall Street Journal, called the EPA \u201cthe laughingstock of the world.\u201d\n\nSizing up the science: \u201cThere would be serious repercussions\u201d by 2020 if the EPA were severely downsized or abolished, according to Rice University\u2019s Baker Institute for Public Policy professor Neal F. Lane, who directed the National Science Foundation and later the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy under President Clinton.\n\nLane says the EPA plays a critical role in protecting clean air and drinking water, and that its regulations have helped rehabilitate polluted water bodies like Lake Erie, which was pronounced \u201cdead\u201d in the 1960s. \u201cThis is not just a bunch of regulators hugging trees,\u201d he adds. Though states do have a part to play in regulation, the country needs a federal regulating body, according to Lane, because contaminated water and air can cross state borders.\n\nThat\u2019s not to say citizens shouldn\u2019t weigh in on the agency\u2019s proposed rules. \u201cThere will always be a healthy debate between the private sector and the federal government on these regulations,\u201d says Lane. For this reason, he said, the EPA solicits public comment before making new rules.\n\nIf Congress supported Trump in slashing funds for the EPA or changing the law to remove the agency\u2019s power to regulate, Lane predicts there would be an outcry from overwhelmed governors and \u201creasonable people who care about their families, their children and their life style.\u201d\n\nAlter vaccination schedules to avoid autism: Trump says he favors vaccines, but giving children smaller doses over a longer period of time. He has blamed vaccines for causing autism in children.\n\nSizing up the science: \u201cI remember wanting to throw something at the TV when I heard it,\u201d Hotez says of Trump\u2019s debate statement linking vaccinations and autism.\n\nHotez, who develops vaccinations and also has a daughter with autism, says studies have found no link between autism and vaccination. \u201cThe anti-vaxxers keep moving the goalposts,\u201d he says. After scientific studies debunked accusations against specific vaccinations, Hotez says those against vaccinations started a different fad: arguing to change the vaccination schedule to protect children.\n\nBut infants\u2019 immune systems face up to hundreds of new antigens every day, according to Hotez. Adding a few more in the form of a vaccination does not harm infants. He says changing the FDA\u2019s approved vaccination schedule without clinical testing about immune response could decrease vaccines\u2019 efficacy.\n\nTo imagine what a future with fewer or less effective vaccines might look like, Hotez suggests voters think of California\u2019s recent outbreak of measles, a true threat to children\u2019s health. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the great killers of children in the world,\u201d he says. \u201cOne hundred thousand children die every year of measles.\u201d\n\nDefund Planned Parenthood: Although Trump says Planned Parenthood does a lot of good for women\u2019s health, he says he would defund its clinics because of their abortion services.\n\nSizing up the science: \u201cThe good thing is that he doesn\u2019t think [Planned Parenthood] is evil,\u201d says Amy Tsui, a professor at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. But, she says, no federal funding has gone to abortion since the Hyde Amendment of 1976 (though Medicaid can fund abortion in the case of rape, incest, or endangerment of the mother\u2019s life).\n\nIf Trump defunds all Planned Parenthood clinics, even those that don\u2019t perform abortions, then he\u2019ll be \u201cthrowing the baby out with the bathwater,\u201d according to Tsui. She says Planned Parenthood\u2019s low-cost care and urban clinic locations, helps low-income women in particular.\n\nIn fact, Leighton Ku, Director of the Center for Health Policy Research at George Washington University, says that decreased access to Planned Parenthood\u2019s contraception services could increase the rate of unwanted pregnancies and possibly cause a spike in abortions.\n\nAbolish and replace the Affordable Care Act: Trump recently released his healthcare plan to replace the Affordable Care Act. Highlights include promises to lower American healthcare cost by allowing insurer bids across state lines, make health insurance tax deductible, and remove barriers to prescription drugs entering from outside the country.\n\nSizing up the science: George Washington\u2019s Ku says the number of Americans without health insurance is at its lowest in recent recorded history, and has reached that point without ballooning healthcare costs. He says he\u2019s concerned that repealing the Affordable Care Act might leave 13 million people insured under the plan without coverage.\n\nAllowing insurers to compete across state lines could potentially lower cost, but Ku points out that state insurance standards differ, and Trump has not clarified which state\u2019s rules would apply in interstate deals. Ku also views tax deductibility as a red herring: Low-income Americans, who struggle the most to get insured, already pay little to no taxes on care.\n\nLowering barriers to imported medicine could decrease prices, but Ku warns that pharmaceutical manufacturers will likely try to raise prices outside the U.S. if imports grow more common. This might cut into some of Americans\u2019 savings. Restrictions on some countries, like China, should continue, he says, because of issues with counterfeited pharmaceuticals. Even so, the FDA would need more resources to monitor imports. Regardless, Ku doubts a Republican Congress would go along with Trump\u2019s proposal.\n\nIn summary, Trump\u2019s proposals have not won over the scientists we consulted. Hotez expressed hope that Trump will bring experts onboard to make more informed proposals if he becomes the Republican nominee. But Lane says he\u2019s skeptical even of that.\n\n\u201cWho would he recruit to his science team?\u201d asks Lane. \u201cHow capable would they be of providing advice? Of course, I don\u2019t have the answer to that. But it\u2019s a question voters should have in their minds.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Republican frontrunner has given hints about his take on scientific topics; now experts weigh in to say what a Trump presidency might mean for science", "author": "Natalie Jacewicz", "og": {"site_name": "Scientific American Blog Network", "description": "The Republican frontrunner has given hints about his take on scientific topics; now experts weigh in to say what a Trump presidency might mean for science", "title": "The Science of President Trump", "url": "http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/guest-blog/the-science-of-president-trump/", "image": "http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/blogs/cache/file/3B69D615-ECC1-41E6-9F583EE66E215B86_agenda.jpg?w=600&h=335", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@sciam", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "The Science of President Trump"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"contentid\": \"B20D631F-D928-47B0-8B66A6B897CF8F8C\"}", "msapplication-TileImage": "/public/resources/favicons/favicon-196-73208969ab1ed3409bc55e8915ed8bae.png", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Cut the EPA: Trump has said he would cut funding for the Environmental Protection Agency and return environmental protection responsibilities to the states.\nNonetheless, the Republican frontrunner, Donald Trump, has made public remarks that give voters a glimpse into what some of his scientific policies might be.\nHotez expressed hope that Trump will bring experts onboard to make more informed proposals if he becomes the Republican nominee.\nAfter scientific studies debunked accusations against specific vaccinations, Hotez says those against vaccinations started a different fad: arguing to change the vaccination schedule to protect children.\nWe asked some science and policy experts to discuss Trump\u2019s stances, and what that could mean for Americans in the future."}
