I think at this moment in time, he\u2019s the only candidate that speaks out about the country\u2019s problems,\u201d Icahn told Bloomberg on Tuesday. \u201cI\u2019m behind Trump.\u201d\n\nGet the hottest, most important news stories on the Internet \u2013 delivered FREE to your inbox as soon as they break! Take just 30 seconds and sign up for WND\u2019s Email News Alerts!\n\nIcahn first announced his support and outlined his views in a short video titled \u201cDanger Ahead.\u201d\n\nIcahn says that while he disagrees with Trump on \u201ccertain issues,\u201d he believes America \u201cneeds somebody to wake it up.\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe he\u2019s brash, but he\u2019s willing to say what he believes and he\u2019s willing to say, \u2018Hey, this is complete bulls\u2014,'\u201d Icahn said in the video, which is posted on his website.\n\n\u201cThe middle class guy who\u2019s making $50,000 a year realizes \u2018I\u2019m being taken advantage of.\u2019 He can read, he can understand. Ya know, in czarist Russia, they had to have a revolution. And then the czars would bring out the machine guns and mow them down. All these guys have to do is vote.\u201d\n\nTrump had publicly courted Icahn since launching his campaign, repeatedly naming him to his wish-list of Treasury secretaries \u2013 something Icahn at first seemed reluctant to embrace. But he\u2019s since come around to the idea.\n\nAs CNN reported, Icahn sent out a tweet in early August that read: \u201cAfter last night\u2019s debate, I decided to accept @realDonaldTrump offer for Secretary of Treasury.\u201d\n\nIcahn added \u201cwe are in dire need of a breath of fresh air,\u201d but later rescinded the offer to serve in a Trump administration while still singing Trump\u2019s praises.\n\nDo you support Donald Trump\u2019s no-nonsense candidacy? Tell the world with this brand new magnetic bumper sticker: \u201cDONALD TRUMPS THE REST\u201d\n\n\u201cHis ego permits him to \u2013 where a lot of these other presidents don\u2019t \u2013 surround himself with really good people,\u201d Icahn told Reuters. \u201cNot just me, but others.\u201d\n\nIcahn, to Reuters, said one of Trump\u2019s characteristics that sets him apart from the other candidates, and makes him the best man for the White House job, is his willingness and skill to hand pick excellent advisers with reputations as the best of the best.\n\n\u201cHe needs as many good people as he can get in this environment today,\u201d Icahn said. \u201cWe certainly don\u2019t see that in many of these presidents.\u201d\n\nLike Trump, Icahn is known for his outspoken views and has similar roots in New York City.\n\n\u201cI want to speak out now because, I know this may sound corny but I grew up in the streets of Queens,\u201d Icahn said in his video. \u201cI love this country and I feel so strongly abut the dysfunction that is going on both in Washington and the boardrooms of corporate America.\u201d\n\nIcahn said one problem facing the country is the carried interest loophole, which allows earnings of hedge-fund managers and other private-equity firms to be taxed at a lower rate than normal income. Trump said he wants to eliminate the tax break.\n\n\u201cPeople on Wall Street, they\u2019re good friends of mine,\u201d Icahn said. \u201cI like them. But not having to pay full taxes on money that you\u2019re earning is an absurdity.\u201d\n\nThe Wall Street guru also said U.S. companies have been doing a great disservice to the economy by camping profits in overseas\u2019 ventures, via complicated tax schemes.\n\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t really allow these companies to bring the money back that they are making [overseas], they are just going to move out of this country,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to happen more quickly than they think. While Congress is sort of fiddling around, this thing is being done. The country is burning and they\u2019re fiddling.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s just-released tax plan shows his intent to bring companies back to domestic soil. He has campaigned on the idea that China takes too much advantage of America\u2019s economy and U.S. businesses ought to have a restructured tax code to allow them to better compete and grow.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Free Press For A Free People Since 1997", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.1", "og": {"site_name": "WND", "description": "Wall Street wonder Carl Icahn, 79, who\u2019s made a name for himself in business, investing and philanthropy, had nothing but praise for the man he\u2019s just endorsed for president, Donald Trump, saying his fellow\u00a0billionaire businessman is the only candidate out there who can save America. \u201cI would say it\u2019s an endorsement.
