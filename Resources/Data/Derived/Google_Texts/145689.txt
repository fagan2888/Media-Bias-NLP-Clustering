Though the NBA took a strong stand against racism when it banned Donald Sterling for life and fined him $2.5 million, the billionaire, caught saying many, many racist things, remains the owner of the Clippers until and unless a majority of the the NBA owners force him out. And even if that happens, his wife, Shelly Sterling, has said that the Clippers will remain in the Sterling family. These facts have not eluded four-time NBA MVP player LeBron James, who has reportedly said that if the Sterlings still own the Clippers next year, he’s going to stay off the court.

In a teaser for “Jim Rome on Showtime,” which airs tonight, Rome asked former Miami Heat player and current vice president of the National Basketball Players Association Roger Mason Jr. if “you think [James] would not play if Sterling were still in there when the season started.”
