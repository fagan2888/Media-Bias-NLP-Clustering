Secretary-General Ban Ki Moon, celebrities, assorted politicians, and several hundred thousand lesser people into the streets of New York to\u2014as lead organizer Bill McKibben had urged, via a \"call to action\" in Rolling Stone magazine\u2014\u201cdemand action on climate change.\u201d\n\nIn my dream, Jesse Watters of Fox's \"Watters World\" is dispatched to cover the People\u2019s Climate March (okay, I can\u2019t get enough of that retro name). As aficionados know, Watters is a sort of goofy guy who shows up in various venues (a beach party, Columbia University, etc.) and asks simple questions. The answers Watters gets reveal alarming depths of ignorance in the populace.\n\nBut Jesse wasn\u2019t really needed at the People\u2019s Climate March. The People did pretty without him. Here, for example, is a quote from USA Today\u2019s report:\n\n\"I'm totally passionate about our planet and what's happening with our life here,\" said Heather Snow, 57, a massage therapist from Wilmington, N.C. \"The whole Congress, everyone has gone insane, and it's time to end the insanity. I don't know how, I don't know when, but it's got to happen soon. We're running out of time.\"\n\nAnd could Watters himself have turned up anything better than this gem from an NBC News profile of Bill McKibben:\n\n\" McKibben is self-aware enough to see the irony in traveling the world, burning fossil fuels, only to tell people to stop burning fossil fuels. But he\u2019s comfortable with the compromise, because he is in love with the results.\"\n\nWhile some 25,000 members of the Sierra Club were flocking to the People\u2019s Climate March, other people had more down-to-earth concerns: would President Obama finally get around to making a decision on the Keystone XL pipeline, which would bring us energy from a friendly nation and create an estimated 15,000 jobs for Americans and which has been in limbo for six years, because the president dare not offend his environmentalist base?\n\nAs a recent Forbes magazine piece observes, the Keystone pipeline, the environmental impact of which has been excessively studied (and studied again), is \u201can environmental and economic no-brainer.\u201d Indeed, as an editorial last week in the Wall Street Journal pointed out, the scare tactics used by environmentalists are eerily similar to the charges they hurled at the Trans-Alaska when it was built in the 1970s.\n\nLike the Keystone pipeline, the Trans-Alaska pipeline was repeatedly delayed. But guess what\u2014after it was built the dire warnings from environmentalists proved largely wrong. The authors of the editorial note that the famous Exxon Valdez spill was a tanker accident and not related to the pipeline which \u201chas had an exemplary environmental record.\u201d\n\nAnd Americans have seen what an energy boom can do for an economy. Fracking, a technological advance that makes it possible to tap heretofore inaccessible energy stores, is the most important factor contributing to North Dakota\u2019s astonishingly low\u20142.6\u2014unemployment rate. Fracking also could take us closer to the goal of energy independence.\n\nInstead lobbying to ensure that fracking and other exploration measures are pursued in a manner that\u2019s safe for the environment, environmentalists have condemned it altogether and are pulling out the stops to halt it and with it its economic promise. The anti-fracking outcry included a jeremiad from Yoko Ono, speaking from that other Dakota\u2014New York\u2019s exclusive Dakota apartments, where residents don\u2019t have to worry about tacky things like finding employment.\n\nEnvironmentalists such as the protest-leader McKibben have what seems to be a quasi-religious animus against fossil fuels. President Obama may have delayed the Keystone XL pipeline to the point of straining relations with Canada, and he\u2019s allowed his EPA to move forward on strict new, job-killing regulations on carbon, but this doesn\u2019t cut the mustard for McKibben. As the NBC profile notes, \u201cMcKibben thinks the president is part of the problem.\u201d And, McKibben \u201cstabs at President Obama for promising to slow the rise of the oceans, then celebrating America\u2019s gains on Saudi Arabia as the world\u2019s biggest oil producer.\u201d\n\nMost of us are praying that we can develop our oil reserves quickly\u2014and safely!\u2014enough so that we can become more insulated from the turmoil that is enveloping the Middle East. Not the People March crowd\u2014they, after all, have their dogma and aren\u2019t going to bothered with such petty concerns as how we are really going to power the economy.\n\nOn second thought, the People\u2019s March really needed Jesse Watters to capture the full foolishness. Let\u2019s hope he goes next year.", "article_metadata": {"description": "But he wasnt really needed..05/26/2016 20:32:26PM EST.", "author": "Charlotte Hays", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "But he wasnt really needed.", "title": "Charlotte Hays - How I Wish \u201cWatters World\u201d Had Covered the People\u2019s Climate March", "url": "http://townhall.com/columnists/charlottehays/2014/09/26/how-i-wish-watters-world-had-covered-the-peoples-climate-march-n1896935", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2014/265/e7869c4c-8772-43fe-8801-49b7bcb5f694.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "But he wasnt really needed.", "title": "Charlotte Hays - How I Wish \u201cWatters World\u201d Had Covered the People\u2019s Climate March", "url": "http://townhall.com/columnists/charlottehays/2014/09/26/how-i-wish-watters-world-had-covered-the-peoples-climate-march-n1896935", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2014/265/e7869c4c-8772-43fe-8801-49b7bcb5f694.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "How I Wish \u201cWatters World\u201d Had Covered the People\u2019s Climate March, Charlotte Hays, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "A dream recurred to me as I perused reports of the People\u2019s Climate March last Sunday in New York.\nAs aficionados know, Watters is a sort of goofy guy who shows up in various venues (a beach party, Columbia University, etc.)\nBut Jesse wasn\u2019t really needed at the People\u2019s Climate March.\nLike the Keystone pipeline, the Trans-Alaska pipeline was repeatedly delayed.\nOn second thought, the People\u2019s March really needed Jesse Watters to capture the full foolishness."}
