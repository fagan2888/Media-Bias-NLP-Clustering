She sends her 3-year-old son to slide open the piece of corrugated metal that separates her home and others from the cobblestone street in Kirkos, a neighborhood in Ethiopia\u2019s burgeoning capital city, Addis Ababa. Tigist Seyoum, a sturdy 35-year-old woman with a large black purse and cornrowed braids, leans down to kiss the boy\u2019s cheek as she enters. The community health worker and the boy\u2019s mother sit on a sofa in the Girmas\u2019 home\u2014two tidy, small rooms crammed with furniture. They chat about neighborhood gossip and the family\u2019s health, including checking on birth control prescriptions. Community health workers like Seyoum have helped Ethiopia reduce child mortality by two-thirds since 1990 and death from malaria, a common disease, by 55 percent. Since their deployment, contraception use among women\u2014from longer-lasting injections to daily birth control pills\u2014has doubled from 15 to almost 30 percent in six years. More than 8,000 miles away in Williamson, West Virginia, 34-year-old Samantha Runyon visits about 15 homes a week to check blood sugar levels and teach people with diabetes how to deliver insulin injections. The nurse, who works in the rural coal mining town where she grew up, is part of a team of four other \u201cpatient navigators\u201d at a local nonprofit, the Diabetes Coalition. Her role is funded by a Duke University research grant aimed at curbing and treating diabetes.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got more time with them,\u201d she said. \u201cIn an office you\u2019re on a set schedule, but here I don\u2019t try to rush anyone.\u201d Across the world, countries have started to embrace community health workers as a means of reaching people who don\u2019t always have regular access to care through clinics and hospitals. Community health workers curb health care costs by preventing complicated disease and emergency room visits. Their titles vary\u2014India has more than 800,000 \u201caccredited social health activists\u201d and Malawi employs 11,000 \"health extension workers,\" but the impact seems to be universal. Not only do the workers treat and manage care, they also help curb health care costs by preventing complicated disease and emergency room visits. Their success depends partly on local connections. \u201cThe area where community health workers catch on is where they retain their community identity and their advocacy for their community and yet have a sharply defined role in their health care system,\u201d said Columbia University\u2019s Dr. Prabhjot Singh, chairman of the One Million Health Worker Campaign. In Ethiopia, community health workers like Seyoum have become an integral part of the tiered national health care system put in place in 2004 to reach mostly rural families vulnerable to disease, hunger and isolation. The country\u2019s Ministry of Health employs 38,000 health extension workers\u2014an all-women workforce of mostly high school graduates with one year of health training. There are also about 38,000 community health workers in the U.S., according to the Department of Labor, but their role is more loosely defined. There is no uniform training or accreditation process, and their responsibilities vary by state. The Affordable Care Act includes a section recognizing the need for community health workers, but no decisions were made about their funding, said Dr. Nell Brownstein from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s Division for Heart Disease.\n\nNevertheless, she said there is a big push from the both the health care system and states to build the workforce. Empirical research has continued to document their effectiveness\u2014a 2009 study by the American Public Health Association, for example, found that community health workers\u2019 intervention in the care of underserved men in Denver saved $2.28 for each dollar spent by redirecting people who would normally go to hospitals for care. Florida and Texas have thousands of community health workers that help manage chronic disease and educate communities. Massachusetts and Minnesota have led the way in passing legislation to define their role in the health care system. Many American communities still struggle with threadbare health systems that could benefit from an infusion of community health workers. \u201cIt\u2019s from the community up,\u201d Brownstein said. \u201cThere\u2019s a considerable amount of work being done.\u201d Meanwhile, many American communities still struggle with threadbare health systems that could benefit from an infusion of community health workers. Until the 1950s, the town of War, West Virginia, thrived on coal production\u2014an industry that kept movie theaters full on Wednesday evenings and powered the local economy. As mining declined, towns like War sank into depression. Now the main street is marked by empty windows and a chipped sign for the abandoned jail. Residents are resigned to traveling at least an hour and a half to cities like Bluefield and the state capital of Charleston for medical care. The burden of isolation and unemployment has taken a toll on families in the area, said Tiller, pointing to black and white photos of the town in more prosperous times. In today\u2019s McDowell County, premature death rates are more than triple the national rate. Rampant prescription drug abuse has forced children of addicted parents into foster care. And around 30 percent of the population is obese. \u201cPeople are angry, but they don\u2019t know who they should be angry at,\u201d said Annetta Tiller, who works as a health liaison for Big Creek People In Action, a local organization focused on health and education.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Popular in some countries and catching on in the U.S., community health workers fill gaping holes in care.", "author": "Ankita Rao", "og": {"site_name": "The Atlantic", "description": "Popular in some countries and catching on in the U.S., community health workers fill gaping holes in care.", "title": "How Community Health Workers Dramatically Improve Healthcare", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2014/02/DSC_0805-2/lead_large.jpg", "url": "http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2014/02/how-community-health-workers-dramatically-improve-health-care/283555/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "theatlantic.com", "site": "@theatlantic", "card": "summary"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "p": {"domain_verify": "68e1a0361a557708fefc992f3309ed70"}, "fb": {"admins": "577048155,17301937", "page_id": 29259828486, "app_id": 100770816677686}, "keywords": "The Atlantic, The Atlantic Magazine, TheAtlantic.com, Atlantic, news, opinion, breaking news, analysis, commentary, business, politics, culture, international, science, technology, national and life", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, width=device-width, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9af0\"", "article_summary": "Many American communities still struggle with threadbare health systems that could benefit from an infusion of community health workers.\nCommunity health workers curb health care costs by preventing complicated disease and emergency room visits.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a considerable amount of work being done.\u201d Meanwhile, many American communities still struggle with threadbare health systems that could benefit from an infusion of community health workers.\nFlorida and Texas have thousands of community health workers that help manage chronic disease and educate communities.\nThe community health worker and the boy\u2019s mother sit on a sofa in the Girmas\u2019 home\u2014two tidy, small rooms crammed with furniture."}
