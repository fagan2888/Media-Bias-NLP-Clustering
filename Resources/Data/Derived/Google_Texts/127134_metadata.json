And I believe Ted [Cruz] can be that uniter,\u201d Pearson told Breitbart\u2019s Matthew Boyle. He said he sees Cruz as a \u201cfighter for conservative values; a fighter who will not give up, who will not give in to the D.C. establishment \u2014 left or right \u2014 and will fight for what he believes in.\u201d\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nPearson shot to national acclaim when he created a video on YouTube in February criticizing President Barack Obama. The video, titled \u201cPresident Obama: Do You Really Love America?\u201d quickly garnered over a million hits and he has since appeared on several mainstream media outlets to discuss his views.\n\n\u201cI think his entire term has been a downright failure, has been an embarrassment to this country,\u201d Pearson said of Obama\u2019s presidency. He criticized the commander in chief for making a big government even bigger and for the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, among other controversial policies. Obama, in Pearson\u2019s estimation, \u201cis a leader who is more likely to apologize for America than to sit and fight for America.\u201d\n\nPearson, who lives in Georgia, serves as the national coordinator for Students for Cruz, which is the official youth arm for the Cruz for President campaign.\n\nHe said while Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) is certainly not the most conservative member of the Republican Party, he respects him for his military service during the Vietnam War. \u201cTo me, a man that was willing to lay down his life for his country, was a man that I was willing to support for president,\u201d he said. Although McCain lost to Obama in the 2008 elections, that didn\u2019t deter Pearson from continuing to rally behind the conservative cause.\n\nPearson explained that he and his fellow Americans are sick and tired of a leader who is \u201cwilling to lead from behind\u2026 and a leader who is more willing to apologize for America than defend and fight for America.\u201d\n\nThe message he emulates is that \u201cAmerica\u2019s best days are ahead of us and conservatism works.\u201d As for his future political aspirations? \u201cI definitely do hope to one day be able to serve my community and serve my county in any capacity. So I definitely do hope to run for office one day and apply the values that I believe in.\u201d\n\nFollow Adelle Nazarian on Twitter @AdelleNaz and on Facebook.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Black Teen Conservative: Ted Cruz Can Unite America Following Obama's Divisive Presidency", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Black Teen Conservative: Ted Cruz Can Unite America Following Obama's Divisive Presidency", "title": "Black Teen Conservative", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/03/CJ-Pearson-YouTube.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/08/04/black-teen-conservative-ted-cruz-can-unite-america-following-obamas-divisive-presidency/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Black Teen Conservative: Ted Cruz Can Unite America Following Obama's Divisive Presidency", "creator": "@AdelleNaz", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/03/CJ-Pearson-YouTube.jpg", "title": "Black Teen Conservative", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "2016 presidential elections, CJ Pearson, President Barack Obama, Sen John McCain, Ted Cruz,2016 Presidential Race, Big Government,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "2016 Presidential Race", "tag": "Ted Cruz", "published_time": "2015-08-04T07:15:33-07:00", "categories": "Big Government,2016 Presidential Race"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "\u201cI think his entire term has been a downright failure, has been an embarrassment to this country,\u201d Pearson said of Obama\u2019s presidency.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERBlack teen conservative political activist and Internet sensation CJ Pearson, 13, touted his endorsement of Ted Cruz for president during an exclusive interview on Breitbart News Sunday.\nAlthough McCain lost to Obama in the 2008 elections, that didn\u2019t deter Pearson from continuing to rally behind the conservative cause.\n\u201cIn 2016 it is time for us to mend the divisive traits that this president has inflicted upon our country.\nThe video, titled \u201cPresident Obama: Do You Really Love America?\u201d quickly garnered over a million hits and he has since appeared on several mainstream media outlets to discuss his views."}
