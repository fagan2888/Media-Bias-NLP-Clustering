He joined Take Two for more on the deadline.\n\nINTERVIEW HIGHLIGHTS\n\nAbout half of the callers into Covered California over the last six weeks couldn\u2019t get through and ditched their calls. What\u2019s going on?\n\nSimply put, there\u2019s a lot of people with questions about Obamacare and not enough people to help them out right now.\n\nHow long are people waiting on average and how many people are dropping the call?\n\nHalf of the callers since February are giving up their phone call. They can\u2019t wait, they can\u2019t get through. Their goal was just three percent of people would give up their phone call. That\u2019s about 400,000 people trying to call in and half of them just say, \u2018I can\u2019t put up with this, I cant get through.\u2019\n\nAnd now we\u2019re just a little over a week away. How do you see that affecting the situation?\n\nIt\u2019s going to get worse. A lot of people have been putting off signing up. March 31 is the final deadline to getting health insurance for 2014 or you pay a penalty. If you look at the numbers, about a third of callers are getting a busy signal, that\u2019s down from about half of callers. The exchange has said the wait time has gone down, it was 45 minutes now it\u2019s down to 30 minutes. But still that\u2019s a long time to wait.\n\nAre there plans to staff up at these call centers in the home stretch?\n\nThe exchange is aware of this problem. As you remember in December they had a similar service meltdown as people were trying to get coverage Jan. 1. They went and asked the federal government for more money; they get $150 million in additional grant money. They have hired more call center representatives but there\u2019s just not time to staff up and add a lot of people at this point.\n\nYesterday Covered California released some more data about enrollment. What did we find out there?\n\nIt\u2019s been well-publicized. They\u2019ve done very well in overall enrollment. Over 1 million people have enrolled in private health plans through Covered California, well beyond their initial estimates so that\u2019s good news. But for certain groups like Latinos, they\u2019ve gotten a lot of criticism because those numbers have been much lower. Another area of concern was African Americans; they\u2019re only three percent of overall enrollment so that\u2019s way below where they hope to be.\n\nWe\u2019ve seen President Obama pull out all the stops with cat GIFs and Zach Galifianakis. Is there anything similar in California?\n\nA huge ad blitz. They\u2019ve tried to feature some real people who signed up and explain in their own words why it\u2019s important to get health insurance. More Spanish language advertising. But back to the point: Will they be able to get through on the phones? Will the website hold up? Will they be able to find someone in their local neighborhood to help them sign up?\n\nWhat happens if you miss the deadline come March 31?", "article_metadata": {"author": "Southern California Public Radio", "og": {"site_name": "Southern California Public Radio", "description": "Little more than a week remains until the deadline to sign up for health insurance.
