Snapchat looks to be the battleground for the youth vote in 2016

The 2016 election may be decided by 10-second disappearing photos and selfies.

Snapchat appears to be the new battleground for the youth vote in 2016 and Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), an early adopter of the social network among presidential hopefuls thinks it is a winning strategy.

Paul joined Snapchat in January 2014 and did an interview with CNN over the social media network earlier this year.

Though commonly associated with sexting, Snapchat, which deletes photos and videos after viewing, also provides a perfect vehicle for Paul’s message on privacy and NSA spying.

“We reach thousands of kids that we might not ever have reached before,” Paul told Politico’s Mike Allen recently, as quoted by the Washington Post.

“But … you have to have something to say to them too, and we tell them … that the government has no business looking at their phone records, and I think they appreciate that. I remember being a kid, and you’re trying to escape from under the thumb of your parents. And then you don’t want to replace your parents with the government. I think kids are quite open to the message of having a right to privacy.”

People born in 1998 will be eligible to vote in 2016 and Snapchat definitely reaches that demographic.

More than 60 percent of Snapchat users are between the ages of 18-24, according to a BI Intelligence report.

It’s also an easy way to reach a large number of young voters. Snapchat announced in May that it had 200 million users who send about 700 million photos a day, WaPo reported.

But while Paul might have the GOP market on Snapchat cornered for now, Democratic 2016 hopefuls are starting to edge in on the millennial battleground.

Hillary Clinton starred in a Snapchat story to commemorate International Women’s Day just last weekend, and according to the Washington Post, former Maryland governor Martin O’Malley joined the social network recently as well.
