An advocate of CrossFit, she felt proud of her accomplishment and wanted to share. When reported by Yahoo!, 6,536 comments (at last count) quickly piled up and though some webizens condemned her practice of lifting the barbell while pregnant, many others congratulated her or spoke in her defense.\n\nLoud and personal opinions aside, the question remains: is weight-training while pregnant safe or not?\n\nWork at a Comfortable Pace\n\nThe Baby Center Medical Advisory Board lists weight training among its \u2018great pregnancy exercises.\u2019 That said, it outlines clear safety tips organized by trimester. During the first trimester, the general rule of thumb is to lower the weight while increasing the repetitions. What should be happening are slow, controlled movements where \"muscle \u2014 not momentum \u2014 is moving muscle,\" Julie Tupler, RN, stated on the website.\n\nBeginning in the second trimester and continuing till birth, Tupler puts the kibosh on lifting weights while standing still: \"Instead, sit down to lift weights.\" The reason involves increased blood volume, which means that instead of flowing as usual, blood may pool in the legs. This, in turn, could leave a pregnant woman feeling lightheaded or dizzy. She recommends that a mother-to-be also avoid lying on a flat bench to lift or taking a position that places her belly in a position where it might be \u201cvulnerable to a falling weight.\u201d\n\nOverall, the key is to start slowly and work only at a comfortable pace and level.\n\nAs expected, Bodybuilding.com sees many advantages to exercising while pregnant, and it should be said upfront that Bodybuilding.com's approach is from the perspective of a personal trainer, not a certified medical professional. Interestingly, the site focuses on the benefits of general exercise as opposed to weightlifting for pregnant women. Beginning with \u201cfewer problems experienced during childbirth,\u201d the site's trainer/author suggests that exercising while pregnant may result in:\n\nEnhanced post natal recovery\n\nLower incidence of backaches and less severe headaches\n\nIncreased energy levels\n\nIncreased flexibility\n\nIncreased aerobic capacity\n\nBetter circulation of blood to the extremities\n\nPregnancy-related constipation avoidance\n\nThis recommendation along with those of the Baby Center suggest that weight training while pregnant is not an automatic \u2018no.\u2019 Many might draw the line at CrossFit, the popular \u2018fitness regimen\u2019 (as well as fitness company) that is commonly described as \u201cboot-camp\u201d style exercising. Although no studies have been done, it seems there\u2019s no real reason to draw the line at CrossFit; a mom-to-be would simply need to say 'no-no' to any of the exercises that seem too difficult or make her uncomfortable. In short, as recommended above, go slowly and carefully.\n\nIt is, of course, always recommended that a woman discuss her exercise plan first with her OB/GYN. After that, a talk with other women who similarly chose to exercise during pregnancy might be in order. In the end, proof of a healthy child born after exercising during pregnancy speaks loudest of all.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "weight training, lea-ann ellison, pregnancy, exercise", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Is weight training during pregnancy a no-no?", "title": "Is Weight Training While Pregnant A No-No?", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/crossfit-mom-be-sparks-debate-weight-training-while-pregnant-no-no-257473", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/30/wenn20667774.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Is weight training during pregnancy a no-no?", "title": "Is Weight Training While Pregnant A No-No?", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/crossfit-mom-be-sparks-debate-weight-training-while-pregnant-no-no-257473", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/30/wenn20667774.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/30/wenn20667774.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Healthy Living", "published_time": "2013-09-20T16:23:46-04:00", "modified_time": "2013-09-30T10:06:42-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Is weight training during pregnancy a no-no?"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fceec9\"", "article_summary": "This, in turn, could leave a pregnant woman feeling lightheaded or dizzy.\nInterestingly, the site focuses on the benefits of general exercise as opposed to weightlifting for pregnant women.\nAfter that, a talk with other women who similarly chose to exercise during pregnancy might be in order.\nIn the end, proof of a healthy child born after exercising during pregnancy speaks loudest of all.\nDuring the first trimester, the general rule of thumb is to lower the weight while increasing the repetitions."}
