Assuming that #BlackLivesMatter is about black people\u2019s lives, what does it have to do with white Mainers, especially those living in our vast rural spaces?\n\nMaybe the fact that we are seeing a \u201c browning of America,\u201d where the majority will become the minority in the next few decades, isn\u2019t going to make the #BlackLivesMatter movement seem any more relevant in rural Maine. That seems reasonable. Change happens, but the \u201cbrowning\u201d of rural Maine, even with Native American people living there, doesn\u2019t seem likely in the foreseeable future.\n\nIn that same vein, maybe spending time and energy authentically exploring that we are all fully human \u2014 as the Smithsonian\u2019s four-minute film, \u201c One Species, Living Worldwide,\u201d points out, \u201cthe DNA of all human beings alive today is 99.9 percent alike\u201d \u2014 seems a waste of time when daily life is all-white Mainers almost all the time. Why think about how we value external appearances or cultural differences when all of the faces we see are white?\n\nWhile I would never advocate for a \u201ccolor blind\u201d approach to improving our world, there are some race-neutral changes in policy and in our institutions that would improve poor rural Mainers\u2019 lives and also support the #BlackLivesMatter movement. Here are some examples:\n\nJob schedules should be stable and predictable. For example, employers shouldn\u2019t be able to send a worker home early without pay for the full shift. People pay for child care and transportation to get to their jobs. Sometimes the paycheck won\u2019t be much more than those expenses; people need to know ahead of time how much money they will make.\n\nLegal assistance should be available to everyone, regardless of their ability to pay. Navigating the civil court system can be very complicated, but our constitutional right to an attorney only applies for criminal cases and a narrow range of civil cases. Nonprofit groups like Pine Tree Legal do their best to fill in some gaps in civil cases, but with their limited resources they can only help about 20 percent of the 50,000 people who contact them for help each year.\n\nBasic safety in our homes should be the norm. The Kennebec Valley Community Action Program notes that \u201cMaine has one of the oldest housing stocks in the nation \u2026 these homes suffer many adverse conditions, such as outdated heating systems, inadequate plumbing and electrical systems, structural decay and lack of appropriate health and safety systems.\u201d According to KVCAP, 50 percent of housing units in both Kennebec and Somerset Counties are estimated to have lead paint hazards. Programs like the MaineHousing\u2019s Home Repair Program provide help to low-income homeowners who cannot afford necessary home repairs, but more help is needed.\n\nAnd finally, rather than responding to drug addiction as a crime, we should recognize it as a physical and mental health issue and treat it as such. Treatment of the disease costs much less than incarceration and is a longer term and better investment in our communities.\n\nThese are just a few areas where improving the current system for poor rural Mainers is directly in line with the #BlackLivesMatter movement.\n\nSo if you live in rural Maine and you see black people on TV holding #BlackLivesMatter signs, or you see FOX News, MSNBC or CNN covering a story about the movement that makes it seem like none of it relates to you and your life, keep an open mind. Fixing what\u2019s broken in our country surely does depend on dismantling our racist systems. That said, those same fixes will almost invariably also help white rural Mainers in some very practical and meaningful ways.\n\nHeather Denkmire is a writer and artist who lives in Portland with her two young daughters.
