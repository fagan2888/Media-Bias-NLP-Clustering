It soon launched an organization\u2014and a global movement\u2014to support those struggling with the same afflictions.\n\nProject Semicolon is a faith-based non-profit that encourages and supports people with depression, addiction, and thoughts of self-injury or suicide.\n\nThe strongest people aren\u2019t always the people who win, but the people who don\u2019t give up when they lose. #ProjectSemicolon #SemicolonProject \u2014 Project Semicolon\u2122 (@ProjSemicolon) July 3, 2015\n\nThe organization explained the significance of this particular punctuation, writing \u201c[a] semicolon is used when an author could\u2019ve chosen to end their sentence, but chose not to.
