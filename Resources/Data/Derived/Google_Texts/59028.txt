Sioux Falls, SD

It's that time of the year for Strawbale Winery to get people up in the air for a birds-eye look at Sioux Falls and all of the holiday lights.

Twilight tours lets you grab a seat in this helicopter and take a tour of Sioux Falls. The tour goes over Falls Park, the Sioux Falls Cathedral, and now over the new Danny Sanford PREMIER Center. The first tour to the public is December 5th. Seats for two and three people are available.

For more information on the tour visit the Strawbale Winery Website.
