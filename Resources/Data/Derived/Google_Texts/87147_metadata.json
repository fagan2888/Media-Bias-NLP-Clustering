Greg Walden (R-Ore.), who chairs the House Energy and Commerce Committee\u2019s Subcommittee on Communications and Technology, said Monday night that a \u201c60 Minutes\u201d report on the vulnerability was worrisome.\n\nADVERTISEMENT The \u201c60 Minutes\u201d segment , aired Sunday night, showed how hackers could listen in on phone calls and track other data from smartphones with only the number associated with the device. The hackers said they were exploiting a vulnerability in a mobile network called SS7, which helps connect calls.\n\nWalden called it \u201can issue of deep concern\u201d and said he thinks \"people will be astonished\u201d by the existence of the vulnibility.\n\nHe said he expected lawmakers associated with his committee to examine the issue in some form.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s something we\u2019re looking at, yes, because it just went public here last night,\u201d he said, before cautioning that it was possible lawmakers could do so in private sessions rather than an open hearing.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll get briefed up on it first and then see where we go,\u201d he said, adding later, \"Some of these issues are better dealt with maybe even in a classified setting.\u201d\n\nHe is not the first lawmaker to call for lawmakers to examine the report. Rep. Ted Lieu (D-Calif.) said Monday that the House Oversight Committee should take a look at the vulnerability.\n\nLieu was featured in the \u201c60 Minutes\u201d piece, with reporters and hackers listening in on his phone calls and tracking his movements \u2014 with his consent \u2014 to demonstrate the dangers posed by leaving the network unsecured.\n\nWalden said that he believed his subcommittee had jurisdiction over the issue, rather than Oversight.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Walden said lawmakers should be briefed on a reported vulnerability in a critical network.", "description": "Walden said lawmakers should be briefed on a reported vulnerability in a critical network.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "David McCabe", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "Walden said lawmakers should be briefed on a reported vulnerability in a critical network.", "title": "Tech panel chairman: People 'astonished' over mobile vulnerabilities", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/technology/276784-tech-panel-chair-wants-to-look-at-mobile-network-security", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/article_images/waldengreg_061814gn.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-04-19T11:54:29-04:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-04-19T11:54-04:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/technology/276784-tech-panel-chair-wants-to-look-at-mobile-network-security", "dcterms.date": "2016-04-19T09:25-04:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "David McCabe", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": ",,", "article": {"published_time": "2016-04-19T09:25:55-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-19T11:54:29-04:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/technology/276784-tech-panel-chair-wants-to-look-at-mobile-network-security", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "Walden said lawmakers should be briefed on a reported vulnerability in a critical network.", "card": "summary", "title": "Tech panel chairman: People 'astonished' over mobile vulnerabilities"}, "dcterms.title": "Tech panel chairman: People 'astonished' over mobile vulnerabilities"}, "article_summary": "A top Republican lawmaker on tech issues said the House should look into whether mobile phone networks are vulnerable to hackers.\nThe hackers said they were exploiting a vulnerability in a mobile network called SS7, which helps connect calls.\nWalden called it \u201can issue of deep concern\u201d and said he thinks \"people will be astonished\u201d by the existence of the vulnibility.\nRep.
