Derek Brown and Bryan Kielpinski added seven points on the night.\n\nThe Cougars never led in the contest.\n\nThe Mustangs galloped to a quick 8-0 lead to force a USF timeout before Kielpinski put the Cougars on the board with a close range bucket. SMSU kept rolling and stretched its lead to 25-6 with less than ten minutes to play but the visiting Cougars responded with a 9-0 spurt capped by a pair of Brown free throws to trim the deficit to 25-15. The Mustangs retaliated with three straight paint buckets and would double up the Cougars 32-16 before Brown and Finneman each drained 3-pointers to cut the SMSU lead to 34-22 at halftime.\n\nThe sides traded buckets to open the second half before Mustang Matt Zager hit one of seven (7-13) threes that the Mustangs collected on the night. SMSU quickly went up by 20 from the stripe at 46-26 and the rest of the half proceeded in SMSU\u2019s favor, as the Mustangs sank over 57 percent of their shots from the floor, while the chilly Cougars went just 10-for-26 (38.5%) in the frame.\n\nPerhaps the most telling aspect of the game \u2013 was that the Cougars, who averaged more than 26 trips to the line entering the night, shot 15-for-19 from the charity stripe. Senior Rob Goffney and junior Mahlon Jones both went 4-for-4 at the line.\n\nThe teams combined for 28 turnovers.\n\nThough USF\u2019s offense ran more smoothly as the game progressed, as they improved their shooting clip from 28 percent to 38 percent, the Cougars were constantly on their heels as the Mustangs continued to rain down 3-pointers. They ended the night shooting 7-of-13 (.528) from behind the arc. In contrast, USF, which entered the game ranked second in the NSIC in three-balls per game, finished just 4-for-18 (.222) from deep. The Cougars were outrebounded, 32-28, and were edged in both steals (8-5) and blocks (4-3).\n\nUSF\u2019s bench was outscored by its Mustang counterparts, 24-21.\n\nStotts also tied SMSU\u2019s Mitch Weg for game-high honors with seven rebounds. Jones added five board to his six points off the bench.\n\nUSF is off for holiday break but will return to action the weekend of Jan. 3-4, when the Cougars will host MSU-Moorhead and Northern State.\n\n\n\nCourtesy: Stephanie Pendrys, University of Sioux Falls Sports Information", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "KELOLAND News", "description": "Behind three players in double-figures and a game-high 14 points from Shaun Condon, Southwest Minnesota State (7-5, 4-2 NSIC) raced past the University", "title": "MBK: USF Falls To SMSU", "url": "http://www.keloland.com/news/article/news/mbk-usf-falls-to-smsu", "image": "http://assets.keloland.com/images/images/default-source/agriculture/crops/barley/46939.jpg?sfvrsn=0", "type": "website"}, "fb": {"app_id": 521498541203189}, "Generator": "Sitefinity 7.3.5630.0 PE", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "Behind three players in double-figures and a game-high 14 points from Shaun Condon, Southwest Minnesota State (7-5, 4-2 NSIC) raced past the University"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda937\"", "article_summary": "In contrast, USF, which entered the game ranked second in the NSIC in three-balls per game, finished just 4-for-18 (.222) from deep.\nThe Mustangs galloped to a quick 8-0 lead to force a USF timeout before Kielpinski put the Cougars on the board with a close range bucket.\nThe Mustangs retaliated with three straight paint buckets and would double up the Cougars 32-16 before Brown and Finneman each drained 3-pointers to cut the SMSU lead to 34-22 at halftime.\nDerek Brown and Bryan Kielpinski added seven points on the night.\nUSF is off for holiday break but will return to action the weekend of Jan. 3-4, when the Cougars will host MSU-Moorhead and Northern State."}
