The shift also is changing the role librarians play in helping patrons discover and access new information.\n\nUniversity of South Carolina graduate student Seneca Jackson is taking the lead on bridging the knowledge gap among rural and urban residents as Richland Library\u2019s Ethel Bolden Minority Scholar.\n\nJackson always has been a lover of books, but he began his journey toward becoming a librarian after spending time with his middle school teacher learning how to conduct research for his assignments.\n\n\u201cJust by sitting at her knee, I found that I actually liked this,\u201d he said.\n\nJackson graduated from the College of Charleston with a degree in political science in 2005 and went on to teach seventh-grade social studies in Denmark, South Carolina, a community that has a large Latino population.\n\nHe said that experience coupled with memories of growing up in the farming town of Swansea taught him there was a great need for rural and minority students to have access to resources to become successful.\n\n\u201cWe have really gifted and talented students, but we aren\u2019t able to give them what they really and truly needed, which are skills to go to high school or go off to college,\u201d he said. \u201cI just want to see more of them at school and understand that information is a very powerful tool to shape your future.\u201d\n\nJackson decided to fulfill his passion and returned to school to earn his master\u2019s degree in library and information science at USC. Since then, he has worked in various positions within Thomas Cooper Library on campus as a Cooper-Davis Fellow.\n\nHe also works at the Midlands Technical College library.\n\nJackson describes libraries as places for discovery but also as places for individuals to gain literacy. The librarian, he says, should guide patrons on their quest for information, whether it be picking up a good book or searching for a job.\n\n\u201cWe are information gatekeepers,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cIt\u2019s more important for us to be open, engaging and basically just be there and help. You have to listen to them. They have an individual story of their own.\u201d\n\nJackson said public libraries also extend their community outreach through partnerships with local school systems, as well as supporting the academic goals of the districts.\n\nRichland Library\u2019s summer reading program and Cocky Reading Express initiative are just two examples of what Jackson says are indicative of the work public libraries can do to support reading and literacy efforts found in local schools.\n\n\u201cI see how the libraries are engaging these kids as young as toddlers,\u201d he said.\n\nSeneca Jackson\u2019s Top 5 Books Anything by Dean Koontz Frank Herbert\u2019s \u201cDune\u201d series Octavia Butler\u2019s \u201cKindred\u201d The \u201cHarry Potter\u201d series Anything by Danielle Steele\n\nMary Kate Quillivan, a studio librarian at Richland Library, said libraries are shifting toward lifelong learning.\n\n\u201cAll libraries are the people\u2019s universities,\u201d she said. \u201cWe really do focus on the little kids all the way to seniors. We\u2019re so much more than books.\u201d\n\nBeyond books and periodicals, local libraries are equipped with music, movies and online services for all ages, backgrounds and educational levels, according to Quillivan.\n\nAnd with the addition of technology like 3-D printers, as well as film and editing equipment, Quillivan said Richland Library is stepping outside the bounds of a traditional book depository to serve a larger audience with diverse needs.\n\n\u201cWith librarians now, it\u2019s all about change and being fluid and listen to the individual,\u201d she said. \u201cAs stewards of the taxpayers dollars, we really listen and adapt.\u201d\n\nJackson earned the $2,500 Ethel Bolden Minority Scholarship for being one of those adaptable librarians.\n\nFrom his time working at the St. Andrews branch as a community organizer for the Affordable Care Act to presenting his research on the importance of online educational tools to provide equity for student learning, Jackson was selected for his dedication to his craft.\n\n\u201cWe feel Seneca is deserving of this scholarship because he embodies many of the qualities that Ethel exhibited. He has demonstrated true leadership, which has led to a positive impact on our local library services,\u201d said Richland Library Foundation Chair Adam Davis. \u201cThe Richland Library Foundation is excited to help Seneca further his education and outreach in the community.\u201d\n\nJackson said he hopes to inspire other minorities to become librarians. He said libraries often have very few black, male librarians and that he\u2019d like to see the pool of talent increase.\n\nJackson thinks librarians are here to stay and he hopes to be one who opens a world of possibility for those who may have not stepped outside their comfort space.\n\n\u201cLibrarians are going to be needed. There has to be somebody that has the knowledge and skills that knows what\u2019s out there,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a whole world that you can go sit in a corner and read books about, and eventually get skills and go do it on your own.\u201d\n\nComments", "article_metadata": {"description": "Cola Daily is your source for free local news and information in Columbia and the Midlands.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.3", "og": {"site_name": "ColaDaily.com", "description": "Cola Daily is your source for free local news and information in Columbia and the Midlands.", "title": "Seneca Jackson looks to bridge knowledge gap as Richland Library's Ethel Bolden scholar - ColaDaily.com", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://coladaily.com/files/2015/12/SenecaJackson2.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-01-06T05:44:46+00:00", "url": "http://coladaily.com/2016/01/03/101130/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Cola Daily is your source for free local news and information in Columbia and the Midlands.", "creator": "@coladaily", "image": "http://coladaily.com/files/2015/12/SenecaJackson2.jpg", "title": "Seneca Jackson looks to bridge knowledge gap as Richland Library's Ethel Bolden scholar - ColaDaily.com", "site": "@coladaily", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"admins": "100009199284505,<head>", "app_id": 1620331954920091}, "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/ColaDaily", "section": "Education", "tag": "Thomas Cooper Library", "published_time": "2016-01-03T06:48:23+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-01-06T05:44:46+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "He has demonstrated true leadership, which has led to a positive impact on our local library services,\u201d said Richland Library Foundation Chair Adam Davis.\nUniversity of South Carolina graduate student Seneca Jackson is taking the lead on bridging the knowledge gap among rural and urban residents as Richland Library\u2019s Ethel Bolden Minority Scholar.\n\u201cThe Richland Library Foundation is excited to help Seneca further his education and outreach in the community.\u201dJackson said he hopes to inspire other minorities to become librarians.\nJackson describes libraries as places for discovery but also as places for individuals to gain literacy.\nWe\u2019re so much more than books.\u201dBeyond books and periodicals, local libraries are equipped with music, movies and online services for all ages, backgrounds and educational levels, according to Quillivan."}
