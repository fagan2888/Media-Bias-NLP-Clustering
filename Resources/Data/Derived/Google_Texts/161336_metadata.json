So this wasn\u2019t embarrassing for CSU because the Rams lost to a suspect opponent \u2014 they didn\u2019t \u2014 but the tendency to give up big plays and quarterback uncertainty, among other things, were repeat themes from CSU\u2019s previous losses.\n\n\u201cWe pretty much got whipped soundly in all three phases,\u201d Bobo said. \u201cYou have to give Boise State credit. They were the better football team. We had a chance to grab momentum a couple of times in the game and couldn\u2019t do it.\u201d\n\nRypien, the nephew of former NFL quarterback Mark Rypien, was making only his second start after taking over for injured sophomore starter Ryan Finley, but the true freshman from Spokane, Wash., continued to look like a poised veteran.\n\nStarter Nick Stevens played the first two series at QB for the Rams, and his only pass in that stint was incomplete. Redshirt freshman Coleman Key came on after that, and it turned out to be more than a one- or two-series cameo, but he didn\u2019t light it up, either. Key was 5-of-19 for 56 yards, with a 13-yard touchdown pass to Joe Hansley, before Stevens returned late in the third quarter and ended up 8-for-10 for 60 yards for the night.\n\nMORE: CSU coach Mike Bobo pulls QB Nick Stevens early\n\n\u201cWe were going to play (Key) on the third series, going into the game,\u201d Bobo said. \u201cThen he had a little momentum there \u2026 so I decided to keep him in the game, and then we didn\u2019t really execute from that point on offensively, except a short drive on a short field to get a field goal. We had some opportunities that we missed and went back to Nick just because of execution.\u201d\n\nAfter taking a 27-10 halftime lead and cruising, the Broncos ended up with 597 yards of total offense. BSU also had three long scoring plays in the first 16 minutes \u2014 Thomas Sperbeck receptions of 53 (on a pass from wide receiver Shane Williams-Rhodes) and 85 yards (from Rypien) and a Jeremy McNichols 56-yard run\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re a good team,\u201d said CSU senior safety Trent Matthews. \u201cThey don\u2019t miss plays. They play sound. They don\u2019t make mistakes. That was a well-deserved win for them. They had three (long) runs and passes. We eliminate those, and this is (closer). We have to eliminate big plays.\u201d\n\nSaid safety Kevin-Pierre Louis: \u201cThey just made plays, and we didn\u2019t. We had a perfect defense called. We made mistakes, and they didn\u2019t. That\u2019s Boise. They aren\u2019t going to hurt themselves. We hurt ourselves.\u201d\n\nBSU also drilled CSU in the second week of the season at Boise in 2014, but the Rams responded with a nine-game winning streak that got them to 10-1. This team probably will have to improve significantly, and quickly, to put together the run required to get to six wins and attain bowl eligibility.\n\nPHOTOS: Colorado State no match for Boise State\n\nBobo characterized the Rams\u2019 situation as \u201ca big gut check. I expect out of everybody that\u2019s involved in the program to come to work. Life\u2019s not easy. Things aren\u2019t handed to you on a timeline like you want. Change is hard, and right now we\u2019re going through some change and it\u2019s hard. The results aren\u2019t where our players expected or our coaches expected. We have to regroup, and you have to play out the season. We have to figure out what we can do to give ourselves a chance to win. Because that wasn\u2019t it tonight.\u201d\n\nThe Rams next face Air Force at home, at 1:30 p.m. Saturday.\n\n\u201cWe have an instate opponent next week and we have to come back and go to work,\u201d Bobo said. \u201cPlaying an option team, we have to be disciplined. We have to eliminate explosive plays. We have to generate explosive plays on offense, and we have to figure out how to get some momentum on special teams. Right now, we\u2019re struggling in all three areas, but there\u2019s a lot of season left to play.\u201d\n\nTerry Frei: tfrei@denverpost.com or @tfrei\n\nGame balls\n\nBrett Rypien, QB, Boise State.
