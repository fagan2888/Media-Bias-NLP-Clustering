Now, the Democratic Party with the full approval of the White House has endangered them as well. That is the likely upshot of the Senate Intelligence Committee report on CIA interrogations, which is evidently so threatening to some of the countries that participated in our post-9/11 security measures that their leaders pleaded against its release.\n\nWhat countries? A 2013 report from the George Soros-sponsored Open Society Justice Initiative says 54 governments cooperated with the U.S. in our interrogation and detention measures, including 25 European countries and Canada.\n\nAmong those is Poland, a nation that stood with the U.S. in Iraq and Afghanistan until it was thrown under the bus in President Obama\u2019s infamous \u201creset\u201d with Russia. As reported by Foreign Policy Magazine, \u201cIn late 2010, WikiLeaks released U.S. State Department cables revealing that Obama had scrapped a Bush-era plan to station missile defense systems in Poland to intercept Iranian missiles in hopes of securing Russia\u2019s support for sanctions against Iran. The cables confirmed Poland\u2019s worst suspicions and contradicted the administration\u2019s denials that the change in plans was prompted by concerns about Russia.\u201d\n\nRelated: CIA\u2019s Spying on Senate Staff Complicates Torture Report\n\nLast July, the European Court of Human Rights ruled that Poland had illegally participated with the U.S. in the detention and interrogation of prisoners. The court ordered Warsaw to pay hundreds of thousands in damages to two terrorists \u2013 one who planned the bombing of the U.S.S. Cole, and one who ran an al-Qaeda facility in Pakistan. Just to remind, these are the folks on the other side of the table. Although Poland has denied all involvement, the Senate report may make them more vulnerable to reprisals.\n\nIt is not just foreign countries that might be endangered by the release of the 500-page executive summary of the CIA report. American GIs and embassy employees could also be threatened. Expressing the risks, the White House has some 6,000 Marines on full alert around the world. Secretary of State John Kerry, taking a break from his crusade against climate change, called Intelligence Committee Chair Diane Feinstein last week to warn of possible unrest. The New York Times reports that Director of National Intelligence James Clapper also sounded warnings about possible fall-out from the release, which might include attacks on our installations overseas.\n\nWhat exactly, you might ask, is to be gained from releasing this highly controversial and dangerous document? It is one more opportunity for President Obama to bolster his progressive bona fides as he rides out of office. Just like enacting a divisive immigration program that sets back real reform and pushing through growth-stunting clean air regulations, damning the Bush-era CIA will check another important box for Obama\u2019s liberal legacy.\n\nRelated: Prosecutions for CIA Torture Still Seem Unlike After Report\n\nIt\u2019s a political stunt, which has been blasted by, among others, 31-year CIA veteran Jose Rodriguez Jr., who ran the program. He writes in a Washington Post op-ed that \u201cthe interrogation program brought no intelligence value is an egregious falsehood; it\u2019s a dishonest attempt to rewrite history.\u201d He adds, \u201cI\u2019m bemused that the Senate could devote so many resources to studying the interrogation program and yet never once speak to any of the key people involved in it, including the guy who ran it (that would be me).\u201d\n\nThat assertion is apparently true; a Senate official is quoted by The Times explaining that the committee did not conduct interviews \u201clargely because of what was then a Justice Department criminal investigation\u2026.requests to coordinate interviews with the department had been rejected.\u201d The lapse will surely diminish the credibility of the report, which took 6 years to complete and cost taxpayers $40 million.\n\nObama Press Secretary Josh Earnest says the White House wants to be \u201cas transparent as we possibly can about what exactly transpired so we can just be clear to the American public and people around the world that something like this can never happen again.\u201d But the president has already banned the techniques that caused such a furor, so presumably it will never happen again. That doesn\u2019t mean, by the way, that this or future administrations may not resort to unpopular measures to get ahead of terrorists. Many in our country \u2013 and around the world -- might consider unauthorized spying on citizens equally noxious. In fighting bad guys, transparency is not always an option, nor is it always the wisest option.\n\nRelated: U.S. Senate Panel\u2019s Findings on CIA Torture\n\nOne of the more damning conclusions of the report, first leaked last spring, is that CIA officers used interrogation techniques not approved by the Justice Department or by their own officials and illegally held dozens in CIA custody. That charge has been debunked by senior officials in the Bush White House and former CIA leaders. Moreover, as Rodriguez notes, \u201cThe leaders of the Senate and House Intelligence Committees and of both parties in Congress were briefed on the program more than 40 times between 2002 and 2009.\u201d He reminds us that \u201cRep. Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) tried to deny that she was told in 2002 that detainees had been waterboarded. That is simply not true. I was among those who briefed her.\u201d Apparently Ms. Pelosi didn\u2019t get the transparency memo.\n\nAnother assertion -- that the questioning of prisoners under extreme conditions revealed no information -- has been widely challenged, including by Senator Saxby Chambliss. When the report\u2019s initial conclusions were first revealed, he was quoted saying, \u201cThere is absolutely concrete evidence that has been gleaned from the individuals who have been interrogated in this program that led not only to bin Laden\u2019s takedown but to the interruption and disruption of other terrorist plots over the years.\u201d My guess is even Obama is happy Osama bin Laden is dead.\n\nRelated: CIA Paid Poland to Ease Qualms Over Secret Prison\n\nDiane Feinstein, head of the Select Committee on Intelligence, defended the release of the report on the floor of the Senate. She claims that the CIA enhanced interrogation techniques constituted torture and were a \u201cstain on our values\u201d; she may be right. However, since the conclusions of the report will be contested, it is unclear that 6,000 pages spent rehashing this controversial episode will put the issue to rest, or serve the nation\u2019s interests. President Obama, who has systematically insulted our allies \u2013 including Canada, Australia, Israel, India, Germany, England, France, Honduras, and Norway, among others, extended his winning streak by condoning the release.\n\nPrior to its release, former Vice President Dick Cheney called the CIA report a \u201cbunch of hooey.\u201d He\u2019s got that exactly right.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "It\u2019s not enough that the Obama administration has offended nearly every ally of the Un", "title": "Torture Report: Another Obama Insult to Allies", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2014/12/10/Torture-Report-Another-Obama-Insult-Allies", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-elections-obama_3.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2014/12/10/Torture-Report-Another-Obama-Insult-Allies", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-elections-obama_3.jpg", "creator": "@lizpeek", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "It\u2019s not enough that the Obama administration has offended nearly every ally of the Un", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc425\"", "article_summary": "It is one more opportunity for President Obama to bolster his progressive bona fides as he rides out of office.\nIt is not just foreign countries that might be endangered by the release of the 500-page executive summary of the CIA report.\nPresident Obama, who has systematically insulted our allies \u2013 including Canada, Australia, Israel, India, Germany, England, France, Honduras, and Norway, among others, extended his winning streak by condoning the release.\nPrior to its release, former Vice President Dick Cheney called the CIA report a \u201cbunch of hooey.\u201d He\u2019s got that exactly right.\nAlthough Poland has denied all involvement, the Senate report may make them more vulnerable to reprisals."}
