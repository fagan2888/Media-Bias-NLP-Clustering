Washington (CNN) Ted Cruz has a lot on the line this weekend.

The Texas firebrand, who launched his presidential campaign last month, isn't breaking through in most early polls of the 2016 race. But when he travels to Las Vegas to speak to the Republican Jewish donors he has aggressively courted, he'll be on top.

The only other Republicans with presidential aspirations expected to attend the Republican Jewish Coalition spring meeting are former Texas Gov. Rick Perry, South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, former New York Gov. George Pataki and Indiana Gov. Mike Pence. They're all at the bottom of most polls. And the top-ranking Republicans, such as former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, won't be around.

That gives Cruz a key opening to prove to some of the most prominent Republican donors, including casino magnate Sheldon Adelson, that he's the most electable, pro-Israel Republican in a crowd of candidates making the exact same pitch. The coalition is deeply split, with large groups of donors interested in Cruz, Bush, Walker and Rubio, according to a half-dozen RJC members. Consensus seems far in the distance -- if it will ever arrive at all.

"I don't think at this time there is any larger faction than any other," said Ron Bloom, a California GOP donor on the group's board who is undecided. "I'll commit to four of five of them financially because I love them all -- and we'll see who comes out on top."
