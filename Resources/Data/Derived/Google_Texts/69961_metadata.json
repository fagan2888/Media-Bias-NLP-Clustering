In recent years payment cuts have resulted in a sharp downturn in revenue for many hospitals and private practices. What this has meant for most physicians is that in order to maintain their income, they\u2019ve had to see more patients. When you reduce the volume of air per breath, the only way to maintain ventilation is to breathe faster.\n\nAs our workdays have gotten busier, we doctors have had less time to devote to individual patients. An internist I know in private practice used to see 15 patients a day. \u201cNow reimbursement is so low I have to see at least 30,\u201d he told me. \u201cIf I stay in the room more than 10 minutes, my assistant will call me and tell me to hurry up.\u201d\n\nRacing through patient encounters, we practice with an ever-present fear that we will miss something, hurt someone and open ourselves up to legal (not to mention moral) liability. To cope with the anxiety, we start to call in experts for problems that perhaps we could handle ourselves if we had more time to think through a case. The specialists, in turn, order more tests, scans and the like.\n\nAnd therein lies the sad irony of the health cost containment paradigm in this country. There is no more wasteful entity in medicine than a rushed doctor.\n\nThe Institute of Medicine, a federally funded research group in Washington, has estimated that wasteful health care spending \u2014 i.e., spending that does not improve health outcomes \u2014 costs about $750 billion in the United States every year. Excessive paperwork and administrative costs explain some of this waste, but unnecessary or inefficiently delivered services, especially in hospitals, account for by far the largest chunk. Total payments to physicians, in comparison, are much smaller, making up a fifth or less of the money this country spends on health care.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut even though physicians\u2019 salaries account for a relatively small fraction of health care costs, physicians\u2019 decisions may affect upward of 80 percent of total health spending. We order tests, prescribe drugs, hospitalize patients and \u2014 one of the costliest decisions a doctor can make today \u2014 call specialists for help.\n\nThere are many downsides besides cost to having too many doctors on a case. Specialists\u2019 recommendations are often contradictory. The kidney doctor advises careful hydration; the cardiologist advises discontinuing intravenous fluid. Because specialists aren\u2019t paid to confer with each other or to coordinate care \u2014 although the Affordable Care Act is putting payment systems into place that will do just this \u2014 they often leave primary physicians without clear direction on what to do.\n\nMore important, patients don\u2019t always require specialists. Patients, especially older adults, often have disease syndromes that cannot be compartmentalized into individual problems and are probably best managed by a good general physician. When specialists are called in, each is apt to view a problem through the lens of his specific expertise. Patients generally end up worse off. I have seen it over and over.\n\nOne of my patients went to the emergency room after swallowing a tiny fish bone. She told me about the experience when she came to see me. \u201cThey kept me down in that E.R. for two days!\u201d she said. \u201cThey did X-rays, EKGs, CAT scans, God knows what. They had an ear, nose and throat specialist come by. They called a pulmonologist. They told me to follow up with my cardiologist. I told them it had nothing to do with it. It was the fish!\u201d\n\nWhat is the solution to this predicament? One option is to hire doctors as employees and put them on a salary, as they do at the Mayo and Cleveland Clinics, which takes away some of the financial impetus to cram more and more patients into a workday.\n\nAnother option is to use bundled payments, which are calculated on the basis of the expected costs of a particular treatment (for example, an entire hospitalization) rather than discrete for every service. A major driver of health care overutilization is that doctors are paid piecemeal. There is little financial incentive to call in specialists if payments are bundled.\n\nReforms will also have to focus more on education. Through an initiative of the American Board of Internal Medicine called Choosing Wisely, medical-specialty societies recently released lists of tests and procedures that are not beneficial to patients, including M.R.I.s for most lower back pain and stress tests when there are no signs of heart disease. These criteria are essential for educating physicians and patients alike about wasteful medical services that they should avoid. If patients were more involved in medical decision-making, there would be more constraints on doctors\u2019 behavior, thus decreasing the possibility of these tests and consultations.\n\nHealth care costs must be contained, but cutting payments to doctors is a self-defeating strategy. Policy makers need to focus on the drivers of waste. And one of the most potent is when doctors reflexively call other doctors for help.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "opinion", "ptime": 20140720191056, "twitter": {"description": "Why cutting payments to physicians ends up costing money.", "title": "Busy Doctors, Wasteful Spending", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/21/opinion/busy-doctors-wasteful-spending.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003009461"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/03/16/opinion/Jauhar-Sandeep-circular/Jauhar-Sandeep-circular-thumbLarge.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/21/opinion/busy-doctors-wasteful-spending.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003009461", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/21/opinion/busy-doctors-wasteful-spending.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "opinion", "channels": "NytNow", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "July 20, 2014", "edt": "NewYork", "keywords": "Doctors,Health Insurance and Managed Care,Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (2010),Medicine and Health,Tests (Medical),United States,Prices (Fares  Fees and Rates)", "description": "Why cutting payments to physicians ends up costing money.", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Sandeep Jauhar", "thumbnail_150": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/03/16/opinion/Jauhar-Sandeep-circular/Jauhar-Sandeep-circular-thumbLarge.jpg", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "slug": "21jauhar", "byl": "By SANDEEP JAUHAR", "thumbnail_150_height": 150, "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "Why cutting payments to physicians ends up costing money.", "tom": "Op-Ed", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "utime": 20150317215402, "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/03/16/opinion/Jauhar-Sandeep-circular/Jauhar-Sandeep-circular-thumbStandard.jpg", "news_keywords": "Doctor", "CN": "sandeep-jauhar", "CG": "opinion", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "July 20, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "Op-Ed", "article": {"author": "http://www.nytimes.com/column/sandeep-jauhar", "section_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/pages/opinion/index.html", "section": "Opinion", "modified": "2015-03-17", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "tag": "Prices (Fares, Fees and Rates)", "published": "2014-07-20", "section-taxonomy-id": "AD8090D7-4137-4D71-84C8-70DA3BD89778"}, "thumbnail_height": 75, "geo": "United States", "thumbnail_150_width": 150, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "CT": "column", "hdl_p": "Busy Doctors, Wasteful Spending", "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/21/opinion/busy-doctors-wasteful-spending.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/03/16/opinion/Jauhar-Sandeep-circular/Jauhar-Sandeep-circular-facebookJumbo.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Why cutting payments to physicians ends up costing money.", "title": "Busy Doctors, Wasteful Spending"}, "pdate": 20140720, "des": "Prices (Fares, Fees and Rates)", "nyt-collection": {"tone": "opinion", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/column/sandeep-jauhar", "tagline": "Medicine, health, aging and ethics.", "uri": "/column/sandeep-jauhar", "display-name": "Sandeep Jauhar", "identifier": "sandeep-jauhar", "type": "column"}, "articleid": 100000003009461, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "Busy Doctors, Wasteful Spending", "col": "Contributing Op-Ed Writer", "PST": "Op-Ed"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcef75\"", "article_summary": "PhotoOF all the ways to limit health care costs, perhaps none is as popular as cutting payments to doctors.\nThe Institute of Medicine, a federally funded research group in Washington, has estimated that wasteful health care spending \u2014 i.e., spending that does not improve health outcomes \u2014 costs about $750 billion in the United States every year.\nHealth care costs must be contained, but cutting payments to doctors is a self-defeating strategy.\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main storyBut even though physicians\u2019 salaries account for a relatively small fraction of health care costs, physicians\u2019 decisions may affect upward of 80 percent of total health spending.\nAnd one of the most potent is when doctors reflexively call other doctors for help."}
