× Supreme Court to rule on Hobby Lobby’s birth control case

WASHINGTON – It’s now up to the Supreme Court to decide whether Hobby Lobby is required to provide a wide-range of birth control options for their employees under the Affordable Care Act.

Attorneys for the companies said following all the provisions of the law would violate their religious beliefs or cost them millions of dollars in fines.

The company’s owners said they object to the morning after pill and IUDs.

A district judge granted them a temporary exemption while they challenge the law.

However a lawyer for the department of health said an injunction could be a burden for the 13,000 Hobby Lobby employees and their families.
