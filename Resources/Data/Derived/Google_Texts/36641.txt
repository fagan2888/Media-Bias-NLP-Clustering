The first trial date is scheduled for one of five people accused in the killing of a Salina teenager.

A Saline County judge on Friday scheduled an April 11 trial date for 19-year-old Stephen Gentry in the death of Allie Saum in May 2015. Prosecutors say she was shot as she rode in a pickup truck that drove past a group of men who mistakenly thought the truck driver had been involved in an earlier confrontation.

The Salina Journal reports that the five suspects are charged with first-degree murder and three other charges.

Gentry's attorney argued Friday that his trial should be continued until the person who actually shot Saum is tried. Prosecutors said they had no preference which of the defendants is tried first.
