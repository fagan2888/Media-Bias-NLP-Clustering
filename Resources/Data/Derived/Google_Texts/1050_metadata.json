In 2014, the first full year of ACA implementation, job growth The idea that the Affordable Care Act has hurt the U.S. job market has long been hard to take seriously. In 2014, the first full year of ACA implementation, job growth reached a 15-year high . The first two years of ACA implementation were the best back-to-back years for job creation since the 1990s.\n\nBut we can go a little further with this. Forbes\u2019 Dan Diamond made a great observation , which inspired the above chart, noting private-sector employment in the United States over the last eight years. The red line shows the final two years of the Bush/Cheney era, as the private sector shed jobs; the light blue line shows the first year of the Obama era, when the Great Recession started to end; and the hard blue line shows March 2010 through the present.\n\nAs Diamond added last week, \u201cObamacare was signed into law in March 2010. The private sector hasn\u2019t lost jobs since.\u201d\n\nMarco Rubio recently claimed , \u201c[W]e have a crazy health care law that discourages companies from hiring people.\u201d By any reality-based metric, the senator has no idea what he\u2019s talking about.\n\nBut whenever this or related topics come up, I hear from conservatives who insist that the data is deceptive because most of the new jobs are part-time, not full-time. This pesky detail makes the seemingly good news appear far more discouraging.\n\nAnd that might be true, if the argument were correct. We were reminded again this week, however, just how wrong the right\u2019s argument is. Vox\u2019s Sarah Kliff noted\n\n[N]ew research in the journal Health Affairs suggests they weren\u2019t the norm: The data shows no national trend toward more part-time employment under the Affordable Care Act \u2013 even if you drill into the type of people you\u2019d expect to get hit hardest.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the Wall Street Journal published a chart the other day showing full- and part-time job growth in the Obama era. Growth in part-time jobs has been consistently flat, but growth in full-time jobs has soared.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "If you're trying to find evidence of the ACA hurting job creation, I have some bad news for you.", "original-source": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/so-much-the-obamacare-hurts-job-creation-argument", "og": {"site_name": "MSNBC", "description": "If you're trying to find evidence of the ACA hurting job creation, I have some bad news for you.", "title": "So much for the 'Obamacare hurts job creation' argument", "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/so-much-the-obamacare-hurts-job-creation-argument", "image": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--1_91-1--1200x630/public/1.14.16.jpg?itok=diWT7kFW", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "msnbc.com", "account_id": 2836421, "title": "So much for the 'Obamacare hurts job creation' argument", "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/so-much-the-obamacare-hurts-job-creation-argument", "image": {"width": 830, "identifier": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--3-2--512x342/public/1.14.16.jpg?itok=QnHcFL1Y", "height": 553}, "creator": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "site": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "If you're trying to find evidence of the ACA hurting job creation, I have some bad news for you."}, "robots": "follow, index", "DC.date.issued": "2016-01-14T09:25:12-05:00", "jenga-session-config": "{\"when_to_init\":\"after_dom_ready\"}", "fb": {"app_id": 351594351545594}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/steve.benen"}, "abstract": "If you're trying to find evidence of the ACA hurting job creation, I have some bad news for you.", "nv": {"tags": "affordable-care-act,economy,health,health-care-reform,jobs,obamacare,rachel-maddow-show-charts,rachel-maddow-show", "author": "steve-benen", "published": 1, "date": "01/14/2016 09:25:12 EST", "title": "So much for the 'Obamacare hurts job creation' argument", "address": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/so-much-the-obamacare-hurts-job-creation-argument"}, "news_keywords": "Jobs, Economy, Health Care Reform, Health, Affordable Care Act, Obamacare, Rachel Maddow Show Charts"}, "article_summary": "What\u2019s more, the Wall Street Journal published a chart the other day showing full- and part-time job growth in the Obama era.\nIn 2014, the first full year of ACA implementation, job growth reached a 15-year high .\nGrowth in part-time jobs has been consistently flat, but growth in full-time jobs has soared.\nIn 2014, the first full year of ACA implementation, job growth The idea that the Affordable Care Act has hurt the U.S. job market has long been hard to take seriously.\nThe first two years of ACA implementation were the best back-to-back years for job creation since the 1990s."}
