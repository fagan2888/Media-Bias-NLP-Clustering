Placed on the U.S. list of illegal controlled substances in 2014, flakka\u2019s popularity has surged, especially in Florida, where it arrives in droves from China through the mail. The drug has reportedly also shown up in Ohio, Texas and Illinois. Other states, such as New York, have issued warnings about it.\n\nFlakka is part of a chemical class of drugs called cathinones, and it\u2019s designed to mimic the stimulative effects of the cathinone found in the leaves of the khat plant chewed in some parts of the world.\n\nFlakka \u2014 its chemical name is alpha-pyrrolidinopentiophenone, or Alpha-PVP \u2014 comes in the form of white or pink crystals that can be swallowed, snorted, injected or vaped. \u201cVaporizing, which sends the drug very quickly into the bloodstream, may make it particularly easy to overdose,\u201d the National Institute on Drug Abuse warned in April. The term flakka apparently comes from the Spanish slang for a slender and attractive woman (\u201cla flaca\u201d). The drug is also referred to as gravel because its white crystal chunks have been compared to aquarium gravel.\n\nRelated: Growing Obesity Rate Threatens America\u2019s Poorest States\n\nThe drug has effects similar to MDMA, also known as ecstasy or Molly. It acts as a re-uptake inhibitor of the neurotransmitters dopamine and norepinephrine, leading users to feel \u201cexcited delirium.\u201d Some users can have hallucinations that result in violent behavior, or experience spikes in body temperature (up to 105-106 degrees Fahrenheit) and paranoia. In addition, the drug can cause muscles to break down, a result of higher body temperatures, leading to kidney complications and, potentially, the need for long-term dialysis.\n\nFlakka may be more addictive than meth and some have said it can be more dangerous than cocaine because it\u2019s difficult to control the exact dose an individual takes. A small overdose can lead to extreme symptoms, including death. The effects of the drug can take days to wear off.\n\nPlus, flakka is cheap. A dose can reportedly go for $3 to $5. On the street, one kilo can cost $50,000, but ordered online from China \u2014 where it isn\u2019t illegal \u2014 one can go for as little as $1,500, according to experts cited by Reuters.\n\nRelated: The Five Most Dangerous States to Work In\u200b\u200b\u200b\n\nAs the drug becomes more popular, stories and videos showing the strange behavior of alleged users are cropping up \u2014 and news outlets have been rushing to share them.

A man in Melbourne ran naked through the streets claiming to be God before \u201ccommitting a sexual act on a tree.\u201d In Fort Lauderdale last month, a man high on flakka impaled himself while trying to scale a fence around the police station.\n\nLast year, authorities in Florida\u2019s Broward County recorded 190 incidents involving the drug, the news service reported Wednesday. In just over four months this year, the number of incidents had already climbed over 275.
