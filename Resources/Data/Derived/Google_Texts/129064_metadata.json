The suit filed in 1999 alleged that the Agriculture Department discriminated against Native Americans in loan programs from 1981-99.\n\nOnly about 3,600 successful claimants came forward after the settlement, not the more than 10,000 expected. Those who filed claims received roughly $180 million plus $60 million in tax payments on their behalf, not counting other relief on farm loan debt. About $60 million went to attorneys.\n\nBut that left unclaimed hundreds of millions set aside for the settlement and launched a battle over how to handle those funds.\n\n\u201cThe scope of this failure is monumental; the reasons for it remain unclear,\u201d U.S. District Judge Emmet G. Sullivan of the District of Columbia wrote in July, calling the result a \u201ccautionary tale\u201d in class-action law.\n\nExperts said the inability to distribute money to more aggrieved farmers could track to several factors: the department\u2019s failure to keep records of applicants who previously had been denied loans, a history of skepticism in Indian country about federal promises, and the hurdles of reaching poor and isolated Native Americans in remote areas who \u2014 based on previous calculation models used in litigation \u2014 were believed to have been engaged in agriculture.\n\nSullivan rejected competing proposals last summer to split the untapped $380 million among class recipients \u2014 which the government opposed \u2014 or to distribute the money over 20 years through a trust led by Native Americans to charities selected by class attorneys. The dispute pit class members against one another and against lawyers who represented the overall group.\n\nInstead, Sullivan called for new talks.\n\nThe original settlement cannot be changed after April 28 without agreement on what to do with the leftover funds, said John G. Dillard of Olsson Frank Weeda Terman Matz, a lawyer for lead plaintiff Marilyn Keepseagle, a North Dakota Sioux rancher.\n\nUnder those original terms, now criticized by all sides, what was expected to be a small amount of leftover money would have to be distributed in equal shares to nonprofit groups chosen by class attorneys.\n\nSullivan said that because of the larger amount left unclaimed, that option \u201ccould be viewed as both unjust and inefficient.\u201d\n\nAttorneys for Keepseagle, the class and the department produced a new agreement in December, to award successful claimants an additional $21,275 in cash and tax payments in their behalf \u2014 about $77 million in all \u2014 atop the $50,000 apiece most received initially.\n\nAn additional $38 million would go to nonprofit groups chosen by class counsel, and the rest would endow a Native American-led trust that could use its discretion to distribute money to nonprofit groups \u2014 an arrangement that could create the largest U.S. philanthropic institution to serve Native American farmers and ranchers.\n\nAbout 70 percent of 300 written comments filed with the court, and several of nearly 100 people who filled Sullivan\u2019s courtroom Thursday, opposed the proposal. Those who objected include individuals who had tried to collect through the settlement but were denied and those who had never filed and were left out altogether.\n\nThree of four named class representatives, including Keepseagle and Claryca Mandan, a North Dakota rancher with the Hidatsa tribe, said that they believed that they had no choice but to accept the deal that includes some added payment to people like them but also creates the large trust and donations to charities.\n\n\u201cIt is with a heavy heart and great reluctance we accept this meager amount,\u201d Mandan said. \u201cIt was too much to risk not getting any money at all.\u201d\n\nAnother representative, Keith Mandan, Claryca\u2019s ex-husband, opposed it. Keith Mandan agreed with William H. \u201cBilly\u201d Smallwood Jr., a successful Choctaw claimant from Antlers, Okla., who filed a new lawsuit this week challenging the distribution of funds to \u201cundeserving third parties\u201d \u2014 including charities with no track record formed just to capture the taxpayer-funded windfall \u2014 at the expense of proven victims of discrimination.\n\nDillard said that he was \u201ccautiously optimistic\u201d the change would be approved, because time to make changes was running out for the court and for many aging farmers.\n\nOf nine original class representatives, Keepseagle is now 78, four others are deceased, and one has dementia, Dillard said. \u201cThere\u2019s real interest in going ahead and resolving this matter now,\u201d he said.\n\nLead class attorney Joseph Sellers of Cohen Milstein Sellers & Toll said the result was a compromise by all sides to serve \u201ca community that has suffered enormous poverty over centuries and has extraordinary financial needs.\u201d\n\nSellers said that he hoped the dispute over the leftover money would not distract from the case\u2019s achievements, which in addition to funds included a systematic review of farm loan rules and the creation of a Native American advisory council for the department.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Native American farmers asked a federal judge Thursday to fix the \u201cmonumental\u201d failure of a landmark civil rights settlement that has left $380 million \u2014 more than half the total \u2014 unclaimed after the U.S. government agreed to pay the farmers for years of official discrimination.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Spencer S.
