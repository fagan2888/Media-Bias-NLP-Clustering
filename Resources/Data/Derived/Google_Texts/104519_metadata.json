While it ended direct farm subsidies, it replaced them with crop insurance subsidies\u2014which may end up being more costly. It kept in place inane and costly sugar tariffs and duplicative catfish inspection programs. And it proposed to spend nearly fifty percent more than the previous Farm Bill.\n\nThe bright spot in the Farm Bill\u2014a tiny seed of good news\u2014was that Congress saw fit to include an amendment that would loosen the federal government's idiotic stranglehold on cultivating hemp.\n\nThe 2014 hemp amendment was introduced with bi-partisan sponsorship and passed with bi-partisan support.\n\nBut now the DEA has thrown a wrench into the law. It's held up a shipment of seeds destined for Kentucky, and forced the state to sue the federal government in order to seek their release.\n\n\"For weeks, we have dealt with unnecessary government bureaucracy, federal officials unwilling to discuss the law or answer questions, and delay... after delay... after delay,\" writes Kentucky attorney general commissioner of agriculture James Comer, who filed suit against the federal government on behalf of the state, in an op-ed this week.\n\nWhy has hemp caused a battle between states and the federal government?\n\nHemp has been used used since before recorded history to make fuel, fiber, and food. But it's also illegal to grow anywhere in the United States thanks to its relationship and resemblance to marijuana. But federal law does permit hemp to be used in foods. And there's a large and growing market for hemp foods.\n\nAs I wrote last year, \"Amazon.com sells nearly 250 different hemp foods\u2014including products like hemp waffles.\"\n\nWhile both marijuana and hemp can make one crave waffles (though for different reasons), hemp doesn't get you high. And yet\u2014thanks to the domestic ban\u2014all of the hemp used in foods (and other products made with hemp) is grown, cultivated, and processed outside the United States.\n\n\"Hemp and hemp seeds are still considered a controlled substance and cannot be imported\u2014meaning farmers in states that have industrial hemp laws on the books have no access to the crop,\" reported Politico after the Farm Bill's passage earlier this year.\n\nThe 2014 Farm Bill amendment was billed as a game changer.\n\n\"The market opportunities for hemp are incredibly promising-ranging from textiles and health foods to home construction and even automobile manufacturing,\" said Eric Steenstra, president of Vote Hemp, in a statement issued earlier this year after Pres. Obama signed the bill into law. \"This is not just a boon to U.S. farmers, this is a boon to U.S. manufacturing industries as well.\"\n\nBut hold on. The Farm Bill provision is incredibly limited. It permits only \"states that have legalized hemp farming to begin growing this useful crop for research purposes.\" And by \"states\" that means \"states\"\u2014rather than individuals or private businesses. That's because the law permits only state governments\u2014rather than individuals\u2014to grow hemp.\n\nAs if that weren't bad enough, the law contains even more qualifiers.\n\nIn fact, it allows only \"an institution of higher education... or a State department of agriculture [to] grow or cultivate industrial hemp.\"\n\nWhat's more, it only permits a university or state agriculture department to grow and cultivate hemp if it's done solely for research purposes and if growing hemp is already legal in that state.\n\nAccording to updated research by the National Conference of State Legislatures, only a dozen states \"currently have laws to provide for hemp production as described by the Farm Bill stipulations.\"\n\nOne of those states is Kentucky. Which brings us to the state's lawsuit against the federal government.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "Kentucky's lawsuit against the DEA may point the way to change.", "title": "Free Hemp From Stupid Restrictions", "url": "http://reason.com/archives/2014/05/24/free-hemp", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/mc/_external/2014_05/hemp-beer.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The 2014\nFarm Bill was a \ndisaster.
