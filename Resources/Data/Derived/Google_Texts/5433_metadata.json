(AP) - The Grammy-winning bluegrass group Steep Canyon Rangers is among performers at this year\u2019s Jimmie Rodgers Music Festival in Meridian.\n\nThe 62nd annual festival is May 1-2 on the lawn of the Meridian City Hall.\n\nThe Stone County Rangers won a Grammy in 2013 for their album \u201cNobody Knows You.\u201d Joining them for performances on May 1 will be Britt Gully and Amanda Shines. On May 2, Alabama native Jason Isbell will headline along with performances by Scott McQuaig and The Tomcats, Emi Sunshine, Holly Williams, Seryn and St. Paul and The Broken Bones.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to appeal to all age groups. The festival has a varied lineup that includes bluegrass, Americana and country,\u201d Jimmie Rodgers Memorial Foundation President Betty Lou Jones told The Meridian Star (http://bit.ly/17jOSpn ).\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re focusing on the fact that Jimmie Rodgers is more than country music. While he is the Father of Country Music, he has made significant contributions to all genres of music - rock \u2018n\u2019 roll, jazz, gospel, blues and other music forms,\u201d she said.\n\nBorn in Meridian on Sept. 8, 1897, Rodgers, the \u201cFather of Country Music,\u201d recorded more than 120 songs. Rodgers was also known as the \u201cSinging Brakeman\u201d for his work on the railroad. He made his first recording in 1927.\n\nRodgers died of tuberculosis at the age of 35 on May 26, 1933 in New York City. He was the first performer elected to Nashville\u2019s Country Music Hall of Fame in 1961.\n\nRodgers also has been inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame (1970) and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame (1986). He also has been honored with a Mississippi Blues Trail marker in Meridian in 2007.\n\nThe first star on the Mississippi Arts and Entertainment Center\u2019s Walk of Fame was dedicated to Rodgers in 2009. Rodgers was honored with the first marker on the Mississippi Country Music Trail in 2010.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Meridian Star, http://www.meridianstar.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Grammy-winning bluegrass group Steep Canyon Rangers is among performers at this year's Jimmie Rodgers Music Festival in Meridian.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/feb/23/lineup-announced-for-2015-jimmie-rodgers-music-fes/", "type": "article", "site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "The Grammy-winning bluegrass group Steep Canyon Rangers is among performers at this year\u2019s Jimmie Rodgers Music Festival in Meridian.", "title": "Lineup announced for 2015 Jimmie Rodgers Music Festival"}, "twitter": {"title": "Lineup announced for 2015 Jimmie Rodgers Music Festival", "description": "The Grammy-winning bluegrass group Steep Canyon Rangers is among performers at this year's Jimmie Rodgers Music Festival in Meridian.", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d"}, "article_summary": "(AP) - The Grammy-winning bluegrass group Steep Canyon Rangers is among performers at this year\u2019s Jimmie Rodgers Music Festival in Meridian.\nThe festival has a varied lineup that includes bluegrass, Americana and country,\u201d Jimmie Rodgers Memorial Foundation President Betty Lou Jones told The Meridian Star (http://bit.ly/17jOSpn ).\n\u201cWe\u2019re focusing on the fact that Jimmie Rodgers is more than country music.\nRodgers was honored with the first marker on the Mississippi Country Music Trail in 2010.\nWhile he is the Father of Country Music, he has made significant contributions to all genres of music - rock \u2018n\u2019 roll, jazz, gospel, blues and other music forms,\u201d she said."}
