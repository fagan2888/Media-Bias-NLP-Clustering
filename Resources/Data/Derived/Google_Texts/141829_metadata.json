Dems' 2014 foil: Koch brothers\n\nDemocrats want to make the billionaire Koch brothers their 2014 version of Mitt Romney.\n\nHarry Reid and vulnerable Senate Democrats turned up the heat this week on the Kochs and their affiliated Americans for Prosperity, which has unleashed a flood of TV ads bashing vulnerable Democrats for supporting Obamacare. Democrats\u2019 message: Charles and David Koch are trying buy the election for shady special interests and big business.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nDemocrats feel that simply defending Obamacare may not be enough to keep the Senate in Democratic hands come November. Instead, they need something to run against \u2013 and they\u2019ve picked the Kochs as an easy foil.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: Koch bros. group to hit Udall in Colo.)\n\nThe Senate majority leader went to the floor on Thursday \u2014 following a Democrat\u2019s loss in a Florida special election in which Obamacare was a major issue \u2014 to call out the Koch\u2019s \u201cradical\u201d agenda, using that word 17 times. Reid has put a permanent target on the Kochs\u2019 backs on the Senate floor, just as he did with Romney in 2012.\n\nBarely a day passes that the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee doesn\u2019t mention the Kochs\u2019 influence in its fundraising solicitations. And outside groups like Senate Majority PAC and Americans United For Change are questioning both the veracity of the ads and who is paying for them.\n\n\u201cThe American people don\u2019t want to have their elections bought by just a few people. I think it\u2019s very important that people know who\u2019s paying for these ads,\u201d said DSCC Chairman Sen. Michael Bennet (D-Colo.).\n\n( Also on POLITICO: Dems seek the right ACA message)\n\nBennet\u2019s predecessor and current member of Democratic leadership, Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.), said the anti-Koch message \u201cis motivating not just to our base, but the country.\u201d\n\nBut not everybody\u2019s on board with the increasingly blunt Democratic messaging, particularly that of Reid, who has unapologetically described the Kochs as \u201cun-American,\u201d \u201cradical,\u201d and \u201cshadowy billionaires.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not my style, it\u2019s not. They\u2019re operating within the limits of the law,\u201d said Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), who agreed that the Kochs\u2019 influence was \u201cobscene\u201d but disagrees with some of his party\u2019s hardball tactics. \u201cI don\u2019t think that we\u2019re going to prove anything with the name-calling. I don\u2019t think we get many results from that anyway. It hasn\u2019t worked before.\u201d\n\nBlaming the messenger is a tried-and-true campaign strategy and success with voters is far from guaranteed.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: Reid: Kochs delaying Ukraine aid)\n\n\u201cThe Democrats have realized that they can\u2019t win on their ideas. Instead, they\u2019ve resorted to personal attacks on the Kochs. This is not a new tactic,\u201d said Rob Tappan, a spokesman for Koch Industries. \u201cIt\u2019s escalated because Senator Reid is running scared and worried about losing the Senate and his job as majority leader.\u201d\n\nSo far, Democrats are focused on the \u201cfix it, don\u2019t repeal it\u201d Affordable Care Act message pushed by party elders. But now they also want to convince voters that GOP candidates will repeal Obamacare\u2019s popular provisions, curtail safety net programs and roll back environmental regulations, all by winning the Senate with the support of AFP\u2019s millions.\n\nA Republican-led Senate would actually be a \u201cKoch Brothers Congress\u201d that would reflect their \u201crichest-take-all policy agenda,\u201d Reid said Thursday. This week the Reid-affiliated Senate Majority PAC launched an advertisement in Louisiana alleging that Senate candidate and Rep. Bill Cassidy (R-La.) would be \u201cbought and paid for\u201d by the billionaires if he beats Sen. Mary Landrieu (D-La.). Up for reelection this year, Sen. Mark Begich (D) unveiled a TV spot in his home state of Alaska devoted to telling the \u201cKoch brothers go home.\u201d\n\nBegich sounds much like Reid when talking about the Kochs, accusing them in an interview of trying to \u201cbuy elections\u201d and calling them \u201cirresponsible\u201d for the shutdown of an Alaska refinery under Koch Industries\u2019 umbrella.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s motivating that? They\u2019re closing a plant and laying off 80 Alaskans and leaving dirty water that Alaskans have to deal with,\u201d Begich said of his ad. \u201cWhat\u2019s motivating it? They\u2019re irresponsible people.\u201d\n\nThe Koch-bashing is a tactic that Democrats believe garners them rafts of free media exposure in an uphill battle against $30 million in AFP TV ads to date that Democrats say distort their record on health care and climate change.\n\nAsked about the ads AFP is running in Alaska, Begich said: \u201cWhat they\u2019re saying is absolutely false. But they still run \u2018em because that\u2019s what they do. They don\u2019t tell the truth, they just throw whatever\u2019s out there and hope it sticks.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "Harry Reid and Senate Democrats turn up the heat on the Kochs and Americans for Prosperity.", "title": "Dems' 2014 foil: Koch brothers", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2014/03/koch-brothers-democrats-2014-104688.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2012/06/120614_david_charles_koch_605_ap.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Elections,Senate,Democrats,2014 Elections,Koch Brothers,Harry Reid", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "Harry Reid and Senate Democrats turn up the heat on the Kochs and Americans for Prosperity.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Dems' 2014 foil: Koch brothersDemocrats want to make the billionaire Koch brothers their 2014 version of Mitt Romney.\nDemocrats\u2019 message: Charles and David Koch are trying buy the election for shady special interests and big business.\nA Republican-led Senate would actually be a \u201cKoch Brothers Congress\u201d that would reflect their \u201crichest-take-all policy agenda,\u201d Reid said Thursday.\n( Also on POLITICO: Reid: Kochs delaying Ukraine aid)\u201cThe Democrats have realized that they can\u2019t win on their ideas.\nInstead, they need something to run against \u2013 and they\u2019ve picked the Kochs as an easy foil."}
