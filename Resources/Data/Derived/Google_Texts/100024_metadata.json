And the penalty for refusal to execute the documents may be in the millions of dollars. How can it be any clearer that the law substantially burdens the plaintiffs' free exercise of religion?\" continued the dissent.\n\n(Photo: Reuters/Shannon Stapleton)\n\n\"Fortunately, the doctrine of the panel majority will not long survive. It is contrary to all precedent concerning the free exercise of religion. I am aware of no precedent holding that a person's free exercise was not substantially burdened when a significant penalty was imposed for refusing to do something prohibited by the person's sincere religious beliefs \u2026\"\n\nIn September 2013, the Little Sisters of the Poor filed a suit against HHS over its controversial \"preventive services\" mandate.\n\nFree Sign Up Newsletter!\n\nAlthough the mandate exempts houses of worship automatically under the \"religious employers\" category, the Little Sisters did not receive an automatic exemption, but received what the Obama administration refers to as an \"accommodation.\"\n\nUnder the accommodation, the Little Sisters are not required to cover birth control in their health insurance, but they are required to certify that they seek the accommodation, which allows employees to get the coverage indirectly. That certification, the Little Sisters say, makes them complicit in sin. Additionally, the Little Sisters argue that religious freedom is not just for churches, so they should receive the same exemption given to churches.\n\nIn January, Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor granted the Little Sisters a temporary injunction protecting them from the demands of the accommodation as their case continued.\n\nLast December, the Tenth Circuit heard oral arguments in the Little Sisters' lawsuit and in July ruled against the nuns. Supporters of the mandate, including Americans United for Separation of Church and State, celebrated the circuit court's decision.\n\n\"Many of the employees who work at the Little Sisters' nursing homes are not nuns. We don't know how many of those employees want or need access to contraceptives, but not a single nun is being forced to pay for those medications under the Affordable Care Act,\" wrote Simon Brown of Americans United.\n\n\"So in reality, the government is not forcing nuns to buy medications to which they object. Whatever health care decisions those employees make has no effect whatsoever on the nuns' ability to practice their religion.\"\n\nIn July, the Little Sisters asked the U.S. Supreme Court to review their case. Among the amicus briefs filed on behalf of the nuns, one was submitted by 20 states attorneys general.\n\n\"\u2026 a number of federal courts have now accepted the Executive's invitation to assess the force of a religious conviction. That approach intrudes upon the dignity of adherents' convictions about profound religious concepts involving facilitation or complicity,\" read the amicus brief.\n\n\"It subjects those beliefs to judicial review, as if courts are well situated to determine the substantiality of the reasons of faith animating a believer's desired exercise of religion, as opposed to the substantiality of the governmental burden on that religious exercise.\"\n\nThe Little Sisters are being represented by the Washington, D.C.-based Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, a legal firm that has overseen dozens of lawsuits against the HHS mandate.\n\n\"Today's opinion offers important support to the Little Sisters' request that the Supreme Court hear their case,\" said Mark Rienzi, Senior Counsel at the Becket Fund who is representing the Little Sisters, in a statement released Thursday.\n\n\"These judges understand that courts and bureaucrats should not be telling nuns what the Catholic faith requires.\"", "article_metadata": {"Description": "A group of judges belonging to the court that recently ruled against a group of nuns seeking an exemption from the federal birth control mandate ave published a dissent against the ruling.", "Copyright": "2016 Christian Post", "Title": "Five Judges Rebuke 'Clearly and Gravely Wrong' Birth Control Mandate Ruling Against Nuns", "og": {"site_name": "Christian Post", "description": "A group of judges belonging to the court that recently ruled against a group of nuns seeking an exemption from the federal birth control mandate ave published a dissent against the ruling.", "title": "Five Judges Rebuke 'Clearly and Gravely Wrong' Birth Control Mandate Ruling Against Nuns", "url": "http://www.christianpost.com/news/five-judges-rebuke-clearly-and-gravely-wrong-birth-control-mandate-ruling-against-nuns-144461/", "image": "http://images.christianpost.com/full/79034/little-sisters-of-the-poor.jpg", "author": "Michael Gryboski", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://images.christianpost.com/full/79034/little-sisters-of-the-poor.jpg", "description": "A group of judges belonging to the court that recently ruled against a group of nuns seeking an exemption from the federal birth control mandate ave published a dissent against the ruling.", "site": "@ChristianPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Five Judges Rebuke 'Clearly and Gravely Wrong' Birth Control Mandate Ruling Against Nuns"}, "syndication-source": "http://www.christianpost.com/news/five-judges-rebuke-clearly-and-gravely-wrong-birth-control-mandate-ruling-against-nuns-144461/", "robots": "index, follow", "bt": {"keywords": "Tenth&20Circuit,judges,Little&20Sisters&20of&20the&20Poor,lawsuit,appeal,exemption,HHS,federal&20government,Supreme&20Court,birth&20control,mandate,nuns,christian&20news,christianity,evangelical", "pubDate": "2015-09-03T16:40:00-04:00", "modDate": "2015-09-03T16:40:00-04:00"}, "msvalidate.01": "29BD7F6D752EB52F5F8F8ACEF4AC6689", "fb": {"page_id": 41093998634, "app_id": 968308226558745}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "Googlebot-news": "index, follow", "Keywords": "Tenth Circuit, judges, Little Sisters of the Poor, lawsuit, appeal, exemption, HHS, federal government, Supreme Court, birth control, mandate, nuns,christian news,christianity,evangelical", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477afa6914bd0286fe59eb\"", "article_summary": "Supporters of the mandate, including Americans United for Separation of Church and State, celebrated the circuit court's decision.\nLast December, the Tenth Circuit heard oral arguments in the Little Sisters' lawsuit and in July ruled against the nuns.\nThat certification, the Little Sisters say, makes them complicit in sin.\n\"Many of the employees who work at the Little Sisters' nursing homes are not nuns.\nAdditionally, the Little Sisters argue that religious freedom is not just for churches, so they should receive the same exemption given to churches."}
