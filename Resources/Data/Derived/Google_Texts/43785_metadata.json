It has infected 8,400 people so far, but it is spreading very quickly and projections suggest it could infect 1 million people or more over the next several months if not addressed,\u201d Zuckerberg wrote on his Facebook page. \u201cWe need to get Ebola under control in the near term so that it doesn\u2019t spread further and become a long term global health crisis that we end up fighting for decades at large scale, like HIV or polio.\u201d\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nZuckerberg\u2019s donation will no doubt make a huge and immediate difference, but the best way to contain the Ebola virus may be to limit visas and not push for the open borders policies that Zuckerberg has advocated. In fact, Zuckerberg\u2019s FWD.us group has spent at least $25 million this election cycle for pro-amnesty candidates and causes, which equals Zuckerberg\u2019s donation to help combat Ebola. High-tech groups have demanded massive increases in guest-worker visas that would lower the wages of American workers, even though there is not a shortage of American high-tech workers.\n\nTravel bans and visa limitations may be the better short-term ways to prevent Ebola from coming to America. On Sunday, House Homeland Security Chair Mike McCaul (R-TX) said that the U.S. should consider suspending visas from West Africa until Ebola is better contained.\n\nThomas Eric Duncan, the first person to be diagnosed with Ebola on American soil, entered the country on a visa under suspicious circumstances. (He should never have been awarded one.) After his death, a Texas nurse who had been treating him contracted Ebola, becoming the first American on U.S. soil to get Ebola via person-to-person transmission.\n\nZuckerberg said he hoped his grant \u201cis the quickest way to empower the CDC and the experts in this field to prevent this outcome\u201d and would \u201chelp the frontline responders in their heroic work.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese people are on the ground setting up care centers, training local staff, identifying Ebola cases and much more,\u201d he added. \u201cWe are hopeful this will help save lives and get this outbreak under control.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "On Monday, Facebook co-founder Mark Zuckerberg announced that he and his wife Priscilla, a doctor,", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "On Monday, Facebook co-founder Mark Zuckerberg announced that he and his wife Priscilla, a doctor,", "title": "After Spending at Least $25M for Open Borders, Mark Zuckerberg Donates $25M to Combat Ebola - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Big-Government/2014/10/14/Zuckerberg-wife-AP.jpg", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2014/10/14/after-spending-at-least-25m-for-open-borders-mark-zuckerberg-donates-25m-to-combat-ebola/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "On Monday, Facebook co-founder Mark Zuckerberg announced that he and his wife Priscilla, a doctor,", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Big-Government/2014/10/14/Zuckerberg-wife-AP.jpg", "title": "After Spending at Least $25M for Open Borders, Mark Zuckerberg Donates $25M to Combat Ebola - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "app_id": 1243316582352556, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Mark Zuckerberg, Politico,Big Government,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Big Government", "tag": "Politico", "published_time": "2014-10-14T10:49:47-07:00", "categories": "Big Government"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda71f\"", "article_summary": "In fact, Zuckerberg\u2019s FWD.us group has spent at least $25 million this election cycle for pro-amnesty candidates and causes, which equals Zuckerberg\u2019s donation to help combat Ebola.\nThomas Eric Duncan, the first person to be diagnosed with Ebola on American soil, entered the country on a visa under suspicious circumstances.\nAfter his death, a Texas nurse who had been treating him contracted Ebola, becoming the first American on U.S. soil to get Ebola via person-to-person transmission.\nTravel bans and visa limitations may be the better short-term ways to prevent Ebola from coming to America.\nOn Sunday, House Homeland Security Chair Mike McCaul (R-TX) said that the U.S. should consider suspending visas from West Africa until Ebola is better contained."}
