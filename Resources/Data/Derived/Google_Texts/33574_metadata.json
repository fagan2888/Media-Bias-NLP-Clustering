But it wasn\u2019t until Chuck was injured in combat that they would be so severely tested and their family strength shaken.\n\nIn 2011, while serving in Afghanistan as a Marine Staff Sergeant, an IED exploded within three feet of Chuck, driving shrapnel into his face and neck. Instead of being sent to a major medical facility, he was bandaged and tested for cognitive impairment, then allowed to return to work.\n\nNeither Chuck nor Elizabeth could have anticipated the extent of psychological damage the blast had caused and the behavioral issues to come.\n\nIt was much later, after Chuck\u2019s symptoms and behaviors caused terrible strains on their marriage and their family\u2019s well-being, that Elizabeth insisted Chuck seek help.\n\nAlthough their tight family unit was under intense pressure, Chuck instead chose to suddenly transition out of the service and into civilian life. Elizabeth didn\u2019t know what was happening with her husband, and had to process the shock of his decision along with the stress of leaving behind the comfort and familiarity of the military, a place where they had built their life together.\n\nElizabeth felt lost as she searched for answers, looking for help in any place she could and pursuing any type of medication that promised help for Chuck.\n\nStumbling onto the VA Caregiver Program, they finally learned that Chuck had severe PTSD and mild to moderate TBI. The diagnosis put all the painful times of the past into perspective, and helped the family begin to heal, knowing what they were dealing with and how to help each other cope.\n\nElizabeth learned that she was a \u201ccaregiver,\u201d and it empowered her to probe for more insights and information on her husband\u2019s conditions.\n\nWith newfound awareness of ways to mitigate sensory overload\u2014and finding some relief from options such as Hyberbaric Oxygen Therapy\u2014 Chuck is now able to function in settings previously too difficult for him.\n\nTheir turnabout ignited a passion in Elizabeth to help other military families avoid the turmoil her family endured in the absence of a prompt medical diagnosis. As a Dole Caregiver Fellow, she now has the opportunity to realize that passion.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Elizabeth Rotenberry always knew Chuck was her soul mate: ever since their first date in high school, his humor and love for family stole her heart.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Elizabeth Rotenberry always knew Chuck was her soul mate: ever since their first date in high school, his humor and love for family stole her heart.", "title": "Wounded Warrior Caregiving Hero: Meet Elizabeth Rotenberry", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jun/9/wounded-warrior-caregiving-hero-meet-elizabeth-rot/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/06/09/6_9_2015_caregiverjune108201.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/06/09/6_9_2015_caregiverjune108201.jpg", "description": "Elizabeth Rotenberry always knew Chuck was her soul mate: ever since their first date in high school, his humor and love for family stole her heart.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Wounded Warrior Caregiving Hero: Meet Elizabeth Rotenberry"}, "Author": "THE WASHINGTON TIMES", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Health Medical Pharma, Elizabeth Rotenberry, Chuck"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda603\"", "article_summary": "Married for 12 years with four children, Chuck and Elizabeth have always overcome the ups and downs of marriage and moved forward together.\nNeither Chuck nor Elizabeth could have anticipated the extent of psychological damage the blast had caused and the behavioral issues to come.\nElizabeth Rotenberry always knew Chuck was her soul mate: ever since their first date in high school, his humor and love for family stole her heart.\nTheir turnabout ignited a passion in Elizabeth to help other military families avoid the turmoil her family endured in the absence of a prompt medical diagnosis.\nIt was much later, after Chuck\u2019s symptoms and behaviors caused terrible strains on their marriage and their family\u2019s well-being, that Elizabeth insisted Chuck seek help."}
