The women lived in the Los Angeles and Detroit areas and about half had received chemotherapy.\n\nOf those women, 12 percent reported having medical debt at the four-year survey.\n\nThat group included nine percent of the white women participating in the survey, compared to 10 percent of the Spanish-speaking Latinas, 17 percent of the English-speaking Latinas and 15 percent of the black women, according to the results in the Journal of Clinical Oncology.\n\nThese proportions persisted even when the researchers accounted for income, education and employment.\n\nAbout 35 percent of the women reported spending $2,000 or more out-of-pocket on cancer treatments, and 17 percent spent more than $5,000.\n\nAt the four-year mark, some survey questions assessed the level of financial strain the women had been under for the past year.\n\nSix percent of black women, compared to 3 percent of white women, said they had taken less than the full amount of their prescribed medications in the last year due to cost. Black and Latina women were also more likely to have missed doctor appointments due to cost than white women.\n\nBlack and Latina women were more likely to have gone without health insurance or moved out of their houses due to cost since their cancer diagnosis, although only five percent of women total had to do this.\n\nTwo percent of white women reported having utilities turned off due to unpaid bills, compared to 11 percent of black women.\n\n\"Overall, cancer is one of the most expensive diseases to treat in the United States,\" Dr. S. Yousuf Zafar told Reuters Health by email.\n\nZafar, a medical oncologist at Duke Cancer Center in Durham, North Carolina, was not involved in the new study.\n\n\"Compared to patients with chronic illnesses other than cancer, patients with cancer are at risk for higher treatment-related out-of-pocket expenses,\" he said.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "news", "og": {"site_name": "tribunedigital-chicagotribune", "description": "NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - Black and Latina breast cancer patients were more than twice as likely as white women to have lingering medical debt and to skip treatments because of costs, according...", "title": "Minorities most vulnerable to financial slide after breast cancer", "url": "http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2014-03-25/lifestyle/sns-rt-us-minorities-breast-cancer-financial-vulnerable-20140325_1_breast-cancer-clinical-oncology-white-women", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-5331f26a/turbine/sns-rt-us-minorities-breast-cancer-financial-v-001/2048/2048x2048", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100001837105818}, "description": "NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - Black and Latina breast cancer patients were more than twice as likely as white women to have lingering medical debt and to skip treatments because of costs, according", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd7900\"", "article_summary": "\"Compared to patients with chronic illnesses other than cancer, patients with cancer are at risk for higher treatment-related out-of-pocket expenses,\" he said.\nTwo percent of white women reported having utilities turned off due to unpaid bills, compared to 11 percent of black women.\nMinorities most vulnerable to financial slide after breast cancerBased on surveys of 1,500 women diagnosed with mostly early-stage breast cancers, researchers found that up to one quarter were struggling financially as a result of their disease.\nAbout 35 percent of the women reported spending $2,000 or more out-of-pocket on cancer treatments, and 17 percent spent more than $5,000.\nBlack and Latina women were also more likely to have missed doctor appointments due to cost than white women."}
