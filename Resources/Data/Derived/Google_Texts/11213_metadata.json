Bernie Sanders of Vermont in Pennsylvania's Democratic primary on Tuesday.\n\nDuring a roughly 35-minute speech, Bill Clinton highlighted his wife's plans to tackle income inequality and the high-cost of a college education, which he dubbed one of the barriers that keep people from participating in the economy.\n\n\u201cToo many people who want to work, can't work,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cAnd too many people are stuck in dead-end jobs and will never get a pay raise.\u201d\n\nHe said income inequality isn't as much \u201cMain Street versus Wall Street\u201d as it is the fault of corporations that post big profits but return the money to shareholders rather than increasing workers' wages.\n\nHe said Hillary Clinton would tackle college affordability from several angles.\n\n\u201cAnybody that goes to a school with reasonable tuition and a decent graduation rate should qualify for help,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cEverybody that needs free tuition should get it.\u201d\n\nHe said lower-income students should get the most assistance, but that middle-income students would be helped by his wife's plan to increase funding for work-study jobs, which allow students to work in part-time roles on campus.\n\nAnd he said she plans to help anyone with student loan debt by allowing student loans to be refinanced the way homeowners can refinance a mortgage to get better rates and repayment options.\n\nStudents in the audience were a mix of Clinton, Sanders and Trump supporters. Many said they came to the event simply because it was a chance to hear a former president speak.\n\nSophomore marketing major Samantha Christine, of York, said she was \u201cstill on the fence\u201d about whom she'll cast a ballot for in her first presidential primary. \u201cThis should help,\u201d she said of Clinton's speech.\n\nJordan Noble, a senior from Somerset County who's heading to medical school in the fall, said she was listening for Clinton's health care plan. She said she's grateful to be on her parents' insurance but thinks \u201chealth care is not affordable at all.\u201d\n\n\u201cI'm interested in how we bring everyone up to the same standard of care,\u201d Noble said.\n\nClinton's speech touched on the success of the Affordable Care Act in offering insurance to more Americans, but noted \u201cthere are some gaps.\u201d\n\n\u201cCo-pays and deductibles in the individual market are too high,\u201d he said to loud applause.\n\nClinton also highlighted the epidemic of drug overdose deaths, which he said his wife would treat as a mental health crisis. He said he recently made his fifth condolence call to friends who lost a family member to a drug overdose.\n\nHe highlighted the benefits of the overdose-reversal drug naloxone and credited Pennsylvania with being the first state to allow every school to stock the drug on site.\n\nThat message spoke to Amber Boozer, a sophomore from Central City.\n\n\u201cI didn't know how against drugs Hillary was. That's really great, especially around here,\u201d said Boozer.\n\nAlthough she's undecided about whom she'll vote for, \u201cthat stood out a lot out of everything he said.\u201d\n\nHer friend Alyssa Bollinger, a sophomore from Bedford, agreed.\n\n\u201cHis personal experience made you feel like you could connect,\u201d Bollinger said.\n\nClinton ended by touting Hillary's ability to unite people, even opponents.\n\n\u201cShe knows how to get people together,\u201d Clinton said. While campaigning is political, \u201conce you take the Oval Office, the blaming is over. It's on you.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "http://triblive.com/csp/mediapool/sites/dt.common.streams.StreamServer.cls?STREAMOID=27bjwF_hsKMofpQbGsW0Lc$daE2N3K4ZzOUsqbU5sYs95MqseccxUfHsWkjWnQOEWCsjLu883Ygn4B49Lvm9bPe2QeMKQdVeZmXF$9l$4uCZ8QDXhaHEp3rvzXRJFdy0KqPHLoMevcTLo3h8xh70Y6N_U_CryOsw6FTOdKL_jpQ-&CONTENTTYPE=image/jpeg", "sailthru.author": "Kari Andren", "description": "Former President Bill Clinton told hundreds of college students Wednesday that his wife, Hillary Clinton, is the best presidential candidate to tackle inequality in America.
