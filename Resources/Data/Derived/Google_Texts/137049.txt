Somerset County Library Adult Services Librarian Cathy DeBerry said she knows local small business professionals and the challenges they face

The small business or home-based business often is a one-man show, said DeBerry in a news release.

"As a result, the owner wears many hats," she said. "He or she is often the CEO, CFO, Network Engineer and VP of Marketing."

With that in mind, DeBerry created a list of business magazines that she recommends small business owners read. With limited access to staffing, funding and resources, the small business owner can look to the "12 Magazines Every Small Business Owner Should Read list so that he or she can learn more about marketing, technology, finance, leadership, human resources, management, entrepreneurship and goal setting, she said.

The list includes:

•Net

•Entrepreneur

•Fast Company

•Harvard Business Review

•Home Business Magazine

•Inc.

•MIT Sloan Management Review

•New Jersey Business

•Small Business Opportunities

•Strategy & Business

•Success

•Wired.

"These magazines target small business owners and entrepreneurs," DeBerry said. "Think of these publications as a free business consultant that is available to the small business owner whenever needed."

Additionally, DeBerry and fellow Somerset County Library Adult Services Librarian Amy Atzert, have developed a list of "The Top 20 Business Books of 2014":
