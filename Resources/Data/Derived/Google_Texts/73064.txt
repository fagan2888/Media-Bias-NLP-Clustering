President Obama’s fiscal 2016 budget request may come as good news to agency hiring managers, many of whom have watched their workforce shrink in recent years.

The president’s proposal would add roughly 34,500 full-time civilian jobs governmentwide, an increase of 1.6 percent over 2015 employment levels. The numbers do not include the U.S. Postal Service.

Many of the new positions would be at the Veterans Affairs and Treasury departments. The request would allow VA to add 11,600 full-time employees to its staff, while Treasury could add 9,400. The new VA staff would help “strengthen the timeliness and quality of services to veterans” and implement the Veterans Choice Act, which allows veterans facing long wait times or travel times to their closest VA health facility to receive care from outside providers. The new Treasury staff would help reverse cuts at the Internal Revenue Service and “improve customer service, program integrity efforts and tax enforcement.”

The budget does, however, propose cuts in Defense Department jobs. Defense’s full-time civilian workforce would decrease by 2,900 positions from 2015 levels, shrinking 0.4 percent to 741,600 jobs, according to the document.
