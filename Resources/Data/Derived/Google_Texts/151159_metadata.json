Nikki Haley\u2019s also-cheesy catch phrase, \u201cIt\u2019s a great day in South Carolina\u201d to know that \u201cSmiling Faces, Beautiful Places\u201d is finally being forced into retirement.\n\nStill, why must we wait so long \u2014 up to several years depending on when you got your current plates \u2014 to complete the looming upgrade in license-plate messages?\n\nThe Latin (\u201cDum Spiro Spero\u201d) origin of \u201cWhile I Breathe, I Hope\u201d proves that state motto has staying power.\n\nYet some folks detect a downer tone in the stating-the-obvious reminder that as long as we are sucking air, we still have hope.\n\nWTMA-AM 1250 morning host Charlie James even seems to sense a hopelessness of sorts in that hope-based maxim.\n\nOn his show Friday, James delivered this withering put-down of what many of us consider a generally uplifting word:\n\n\u201cHow much good does \u2018hope\u2019 do for you? I took a big old pile of hope to the bank one time and they wouldn\u2019t cash it. So I don\u2019t like the word hope. It is a \u2018less than\u2019 attitude.\u201d\n\nAnd: \u201cWhy don\u2019t you just quit having hope and start getting off your butt and doing something? Donald Trump didn\u2019t build an $8.9 billion empire from hope. Steve Jobs didn\u2019t build Apple computer off of hope. He built it off of action.\u201d\n\nAnd: \u201cPut an action word in there. ... Hope is a longing or a desire or a wish. Hope isn\u2019t an action word. Hope is an inaction word.\u201d\n\nGee, let\u2019s hope few South Carolinians share James\u2019 depressing interpretation of \u201chope.\u201d\n\nAfter all, \u201chope\u201d doesn\u2019t necessarily block action. Indeed, \u201chope\u201d can be a powerful motivator for action.\n\nAnd those of us who have long hoped for the action of removing that insipid \u201cSmiling Faces, Beautiful Places\u201d pitch from S.C. license plates can now breathe more easily knowing our wish will be granted.\n\nMaybe you also have been hoping for a different state motto than \u201cWhile I Breathe, I Hope.\u201d Maybe you didn\u2019t know this second S.C. motto already existed:\n\n\u201cPrepared In Mind And Resources\u201d (from the Latin \u201cAnimis Opibusque Parati\u201d).\n\nPrepared for what?\n\nStates of confusion\n\nNow prepare for a test on which states have these mottoes (answers later in the column), which hopefully will help you better appreciate our mottoes:\n\n1) \u201cStrong Deeds, Gentle Words\u201d (from the Italian \u201cFatti Maschii, Parole Femine\u201d).\n\n2) \u201cShe Flies With Her Own Wings\u201d (from the Latin \u201cAlis Volat Propriis\u201d).\n\n3) \u201cThus Always To Tyrants\u201d (from the Latin \u201cSic Semper Tyrannis\u201d).\n\n4) \u201cTo Be, Rather Than To Seem\u201d (from the Latin \u201cEsse Quam Videri\u201d).\n\nLocal priorities\n\nMuch closer to home, representatives from The Beach Co., the city\u2019s planning staff, and neighborhood and preservation groups met again Friday to discuss what should \u2014 and should not \u2014 happen at the Sgt. Jasper site.\n\nAnd that\u2019s a reminder of Charleston\u2019s motto:\n\n\u201cAedes Mores Juraque Curat\u201d (\u201cShe Guards Her Buildings, Customs, and Laws\u201d).\n\nVive la difference\n\n1) Maryland. The official line from \u201cThe Old Line State\u201d is that its motto from the Italian, \u201cFatti Maschii, Parole Femine,\u201d means \u201cStrong Deeds, Gentle Words.\u201d But Anthony Shugaar, an expert linguist, wrote last year in The Washington Post that the direct translation is \u201cManly Deeds, Womanly Words.\u201d\n\nShugaar added that Giuseppe Patota, director of the Garzanti Italian Dictionary in Milan, says the phrase \u201chas distinctly sexist connotations\u201d and \u201cbelongs to a misogynistic and politically highly incorrect tradition.\u201d\n\n2) Oregon. \u201cShe Flies With Her Own Wings\u201d sounds weird. Yet it also sounds like not just a celebration of woman power but a tribute to self-reliance, regardless of gender.\n\n3) Virginia. Virginian John Wilkes Booth shouted \u201cSic Semper Tyrannis\u201d (\u201cThus Always to Tyrants\u201d) after fatally shooting President Abraham Lincoln. Thus, that warning is always linked to that assassination.\n\n4) North Carolina. \u201cTo Be, Rather Than To Seem\u201d is an intriguing, potentially existential challenge. But some (though not all) Tar Heel fans seem to be chronic sore losers as they keep whining about that onsides-kick offsides call late in Clemson\u2019s 45-37 victory over UNC two weeks ago in the Atlantic Coast Conference championship game.\n\nVeni, vidi, vici\n\nIf Clemson coach Dabo Swinney\u2019s winning ways with words, acronyms and landing talented recruits have staying power, perhaps we will one day put his \u201cB.Y.O.G.\u201d (\u201cBring Your Own Guts\u201d) credo on our license plates.\n\nOr should that be \u201cB.Y.O.R.\u201d (\u201cBring Your Own Referees\u201d)?\n\nBetter yet, we should go with this variation on one of our state mottoes:\n\nWhile I Drive, I Don\u2019t Text.\n\nFrank Wooten is assistant editor of The Post and Courier.
