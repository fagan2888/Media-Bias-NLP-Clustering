Most major health insurance is accepted. For patients paying cash or credit, treatment prices are posted at each clinic and on www.minuteclinic.com. The cost for most services starts at $79.\n\n\u201cWe face a significant shortage in primary care providers, an aging Baby Boomer population and the addition of millions of newly insured patients through the Affordable Care Act. By increasing access to high quality, affordable care at convenient clinic locations, MinuteClinic can help support the primary care medical home in Wisconsin,\u201d Andrew Sussman, M.D., MinuteClinic President and CVS Health Senior Vice President/Associate Chief Medical Officer said in a statement posted on CVS\u2019 website.\n\nMinuteClinic nurse practitioners specialize in family health care and can diagnose, treat and write prescriptions for common family illnesses such as strep throat and ear, eye, sinus, bladder and bronchial infections. Minor wounds, abrasions, skin conditions and joint sprains are treated, and common vaccinations such as influenza, tetanus, pneumonia and Hepatitis A & B are available at most locations. Walk-in camp, sports and college physicals are available daily.\n\nIn addition, MinuteClinic administers a series of wellness services designed to help patients identify lifestyle changes needed to improve their current and future health, including screenings and monitoring for diabetes, high blood pressure and high cholesterol.\n\nAt the conclusion of each visit, MinuteClinic practitioners give the patient a visit summary, educational material and a prescription (when clinically appropriate). A diagnostic record is sent via electronic health record, fax or mail to the patient\u2019s primary care provider with permission.\n\nSussman says MinuteClinic is committed to helping patients find a medical home and believes it can play a complementary role in working with primary care providers.\n\n\u201cAbout 50 percent of our visits occur on evenings, weekends and holidays when patients may not be able to get an appointment with their primary care provider. And about half of the patients we see at MinuteClinic do not have a personal physician,\u201d Sussman said.\n\nPatients who visit MinuteClinic without a primary care provider are provided a list of physicians in the area who are accepting new patients.\n\n\u201cMinuteClinic also has affiliations with 47 major health systems around the country, with joint clinical programs and integration of electronic medical records,\u201d Sussman said.\n\nThe MinuteClinic walk-in medical clinics in Wisconsin operate from 8:30 a.m. to 7:30 p.m., Monday through Friday; 9:00 a.m. to 5:30 p.m., Saturday; and 10:00 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. Sunday.\n\nNow Open:\n\nMenomonee Falls: N. 83 W15550 Appleton Ave\n\nMilwaukee: 1650 Farwell Ave.\n\nMilwaukee: 3860 S. 27th St.\n\nWaukesha: 1130 W.
