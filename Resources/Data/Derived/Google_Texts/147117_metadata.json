If they're not allowed to lift me, how can they expect my 58-year-old wife to lift me on her own?\" Mr Conway said.\n\nA Jetstar spokesman said the company's transfer method \u2013 the slide board and slide cloth \u2013 was appropriate and reasonable.\n\n\"We carry more than 40,000 passengers requiring specific assistance every year and offer a range of assistance to ensure customers are able to travel safely and comfortably,\" the spokesman said.\n\nJetstar refunded the couple's tickets and although they were re-booked on a later Qantas flight to Melbourne, they were left without a return flight home on the busy Anzac Day long weekend.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "NSW", "application-name": "The Sydney Morning Herald", "og": {"site_name": "The Sydney Morning Herald", "description": "Jim Conway was left feeling &quot;frustrated&quot; and &quot;powerless&quot; after he was unable to board a flight to Melbourne in April because Jetstar did not have measures in place to transfer him safely into his seat.", "title": "Jetstar business model leaves Jim Conway stuck in wheelchair", "url": "http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/jetstar-business-model-leaves-jim-conway-stuck-in-wheelchair-20140614-zs7vr.html", "image": "http://images.smh.com.au/2014/02/12/5155383/FAIRFAX-logo.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@smh", "image": {"src": "http://images.smh.com.au/2014/02/12/5155383/FAIRFAX-logo.jpg"}, "description": "Jim Conway was left feeling \"frustrated\" and \"powerless\" after he was unable to board a flight to Melbourne in April because Jetstar did not have measures in place to transfer him safely into his seat.", "card": "summary", "title": "Jetstar business model leaves Jim Conway stuck in wheelchair"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "Open The Sydney Morning Herald", "robots": "ACAP allow-present prohibited-modification=annotation", "fb": {"app_id": 193677504039845}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.smh.com.au", "msapplication-task": "name=Weather;action-uri=http://www.smh.com.au/weather;icon-uri=http://www.smh.com.au/favicon.ico;", "description": "Jim Conway was left feeling \"frustrated\" and \"powerless\" after he was unable to board a flight to Melbourne in April because Jetstar did ..."}, "article_summary": "Mr Conway said.\n\"It's all very well to have a low-service business model but you can't have a low-service business model that breaks the law,\" Mr Innes said.\n\"If you are in a wheelchair and can't lift yourself out, don't attempt to fly with Jetstar.\"\nThat is the message renowned Australian musician Jim Conway has for disabled people who cannot independently lift themselves out of a wheelchair and into a plane seat.\nMr Conway, who recently retired from a 40-year career, which included playing with The Captain Matchbox Whoopee Band, The Backsliders and Jim Conway's Big Wheel, said his disability had not stopped him flying."}
