He is distinctive in the things that make him wild. But if you push the right buttons, restrained he isn't.\n\nThere is a limit to Roberts\u2019s willingness to drink the right-wing Kool-Aid. It is difficult to say, in advance of a decision, where that limit is drawn. In NFIB v. Sebelius (2012), the first health care case, his opinion is full of sympathy for the challengers, ready to reshape constitutional law in accordance with their vision. He declared a range of previously unheard-of limits on congressional power, but ultimately concluded that striking down major legislation, enacted by a huge effort before anyone thought of those limits, went too far.\n\nThis term's health care case, King v. Burwell, is similar. It should never have been brought. Aside from the flaws in the legal arguments\u2014they would have undermined the entire point of the statute on the basis of a dubious interpretation of a few sentences, which is not what statutory interpretation normally does\u2014it deliberately aimed at serious harm to millions of Americans and a body blow to the U.S. economy.\n\nDartmouth professor Brendan Nyhan writes that what may look like a leftward tendency on the Supreme Court is actually the consequence of conservatives\u2019 willingness to try out increasingly extreme legal theories in the Court, confident that some of them will persuade these judges. The fact that the claims in both health care cases made it as far as they did suggests that the conservative lawyers aren\u2019t wrong. Claims that would have been summarily rejected a few years ago are now taken seriously by constitutional lawyers.\n\nThe strange nature of the claims in King v. Burwell, which construed the ACA to destroy the health insurance markets it was intended to reform, are enough to justify Roberts\u2019s decision to reject those claims. But the appalling consequences had to give him pause. In the first health care case, with the 2012 election looming, Roberts had to worry about President Barack Obama, with a billion dollar budget, portraying the Court as a bunch of political hacks. But had the Court struck down Obamacare then, most people wouldn\u2019t have felt the devastation of the decision because they weren\u2019t yet receiving the law's benefits.\n\nNow they are. Had the Supreme Court invalidated the challenged subsidies in King, it wouldn\u2019t have just been the politicians going after the justices. There would have been signs on the Court steps saying, \u201cJohn Roberts killed my mother.\u201d Journalistic investigation would have confirmed that the signs were accurate. Not good for the Court as an institution, and for Roberts as its leader.\n\nThe essence of Roberts\u2019s restraint is this: He is less of a zealot than his colleagues on his right.
