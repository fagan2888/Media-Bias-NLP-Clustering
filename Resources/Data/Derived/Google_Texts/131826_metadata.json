In her new book The Radical Housewife, Shannon Drury reclaims the real meaning of \u201cfamily values\u201d as she advocates for a world and a government that actually puts children first. Through her experiences as president of the Minnesota chapter of the National Organization for Women, her wildly popular blog of the same name, and contributions to various other publications (including Avital Norman Nathman\u2019s The Good Mother Myth), she\u2019s waded through topics like abortion rights, classism, depression, and raising thoughtful kids \u2013 all with an equal dose of urgency and humor.\n\nDrury\u2019s self-awareness is what makes her such a fascinating read. She has in-depth knowledge to share on heavy topics, but she does so in such a relatable way, never afraid to reveal her own personal struggles and changes of heart in the process. Her clear explanations of the endless ways the system is stacked against the many millions of Americans who are not rich white men is the long-awaited answer for anyone who\u2019s ever wondered why we still need feminism (spoiler alert: we need it, and bad). After the jump, Shannon\u2019s chat with me about her new book, fostering modern feminism, and parenting in today\u2019s not-so-equal world:\n\nThe Frisky: First off, what inspired you to write the book?\n\nShannon Drury: Well, as I describe in the book, my teenage goal was to write the Great American Novel. When my son was in preschool I actually finished the first bloated draft of a novel that was American, but by no means great. Plans to write another were derailed by the birth of my daughter and the hard truth that parenting two kids is more than twice the work! When I returned to writing again it was in the form of a MySpace blog that two friends talked me into creating. I found that short essays about parenting and activism suited me. At some point my husband suggested building a memoir around my blog posts, and since he\u2019s the smartest person I know, I took him up on it.\n\nHow did you first come up with the nickname \u201cthe radical housewife\u201d? What\u2019s your definition of radical?\n\nMy friend Erin Matson went to college in the D.C. area and had seen performances by the activist group the Radical Cheerleaders. We loved the idea of reappropriating stereotypes for attention-grabbing feminist action, and wondered if we could dream up something like it for our work in Minnesota NOW. I think I joked that I could lead an army of Radical Housewives in aprons and dish gloves demanding equal pay reparations. When I started my MySpace blog, the name seemed perfect.\n\nI realize that I am using \u201cradical\u201d in a much different context than, say, Angela Davis or members of the Occupy movement. While I share the opinion that capitalist patriarchy is killing us all slowly, I am working within the system to affect change. I suppose that makes me a \u201cliberal\u201d housewife, but that doesn\u2019t sound nearly as funny.\n\nI was really moved by your experiences with postpartum depression. While I don\u2019t have kids, I really identified with your longing for the other women in the weekly moms\u2019 group to be more honest about how emotionally difficult parenting is, because it seems really damaging when women feel pressure to hide under the \u201clife is perfect\u201d lens that so many of us resort to. What can we do to make the world more hospitable to the reality that many, many mothers cope with depression and anxiety?\n\nIf I knew that I\u2019d be smiling at you from the cover of Oprah magazine as a hero to every mom in America! In truth I really can\u2019t stand the Oprah-fueled advice-industrial complex that promises to fix all of your problems with the right book, the right diet, the right baby stroller, the right brand of makeup. It\u2019s bullshit.\n\nI believe in the transformative power of a personal story. I think we are all in the process of \u201ccoming out\u201d as our true selves in a world that sorts us into either/or binaries: good/bad, black/white, happy/sad, etc. The more women tell the true, non-Oprahfied version of their experiences the saner we\u2019ll all feel.\n\nDo you think growing up with a working class background impacted the way you view activism?\n\nI grew up with a grandmother who preached the gospel of the New Deal and told us how programs like the WPA saved her young family from starvation. To my mind, \u201cbig government\u201d has the power to shape a more just, equal, and sane society. But that can\u2019t happen if average people are silent and let the one percent dictate policy.\n\nI also think it\u2019s easier for a garbageman\u2019s daughter to see the way that classism intersects with feminism and other social justice movements. For example, I\u2019m very open about much I disagree with the label \u201cpro-choice,\u201d because millions of American women don\u2019t have the options that women of economic privilege (who, let\u2019s face it, are overrepresented in positions of feminist leadership) take for granted. Discrimination against poor women is codified into law by the Hyde Amendment, which forbids covering abortion services under Medicaid. How is that okay? How can I have different rights from women in my own community?\n\nYou mention in the book that the feminist movement has a lot of divisive attitudes that give way to bickering and can give off a vibe that feminism is only for a very specific \u201ctype\u201d of woman. How do we go about making the movement more diverse?\n\nAgain, if I knew that, I\u2019d be the President of National NOW\u2014or not because the job really ought to be held by a young woman of color! And then there\u2019s the argument that today\u2019s feminist movement is no longer in need of larger, membership-driven organizations of its kind, that social media is remaking what feminist activism looks like and can achieve. Personally, I think there space for and the need for both. I love how so-called \u201chashtag activism\u201d is amplifying the voices of people who didn\u2019t usually get a seat at the table. The trick is to get those at the table, which in this case is political leadership and the mainstream media, to stop clarifying online activism with quotation marks (see above!) and treat it like the genuine work it is.\n\nIs there anything feminists should keep their eyes open for or be especially conscious of when choosing who to vote for in next month\u2019s midterm elections?\n\nIt\u2019s not enough to check party affiliation anymore\u2014feminist voters need to do their homework to find out where candidates stand on a wide range of feminist issues. Where does the legislator stand on the Affordable Care Act? Do they support companies like Hobby Lobby getting involved in the private health matters of their employees? Where do they stand on pay equity? Fully funding the federal Violence Against Women Act? And don\u2019t forget to look down the ticket, as well. Mayoral and city council candidates have a lot of power to enact living wage legislation and to support programs that award contracts to women- and minority-owned businesses. My own city, Minneapolis, recently celebrated its first Indigenous Peoples\u2019 Day on October 12 and is considering an ordinance that would mandate more gender-neutral bathrooms. Candidates for school board should voice support for science-based sexual education for students.\n\nNow, researching all of this can be a lot of work. If you\u2019re short of time, I find that putting out a call for advice on Facebook is a nice shortcut\u2014though I run in heavily activist circles. I tend not to do this on Twitter because I get campaign bots coming after me.\n\nThere\u2019s something of an epidemic of female celebrities rejecting being called feminists. Do you have any advice or insight for young women who shy away from the word \u201cfeminist\u201d or don\u2019t like to identify as one?\n\nI do wonder about the current media atmosphere that is pushing celebrity women to identify themselves as feminists\u2014I wonder if it isn\u2019t in some way driven by editors seizing on a new way to make young celebrities look foolish.\n\nAnyway, the backlash against feminism did, and does, a better job of defining what feminism is and isn\u2019t than the movement itself. I try to talk about feminism as one part of a larger movement for social justice, including gender justice, economic justice, racial justice, et cetera. On a personal level, I talk about feminism as creating space for people to live authentic, safe lives, where women are as free to walk down the street as men are to cry in public.\n\nI used to be more annoyed by women who refuse to identify as feminist while obviously reaping feminism\u2019s benefits, but it doesn\u2019t seem to rattle me as much anymore. Perhaps I\u2019m mellowing with age.\n\nYou mentioned in the book that 10 years ago, gay marriage seemed as likely as you \u201cappearing on the cover of Vogue.\u201d Do you think that in ten years, we might see that same kind of unbelievable progress with reproductive rights and gender equality?\n\nWe could if the reproductive justice movement adopted some of the tactics of the LGBT rights movement, starting with the need for women to \u201ccome out\u201d about their abortion experiences, especially their completely uninteresting ones. It\u2019s estimated that one in three American women will have the procedure in her lifetime, but we rarely hear about it\u2014and when we do, we only hear stories like the ones shared recently by Wendy Davis, stories that are clarified by the pregnancy being life-threatening or similarly physically dangerous in some way. We don\u2019t hear the average story, which comes from a woman who has an abortion because she is not ready, willing, or able to be a parent.\n\nI am also waiting for the reproductive justice movement to be reframed as a movement that affects the health and well-being of families, as the marriage equality movement did so skillfully. Studies have shown that children of same-sex couples are often better adjusted and happier than other kids, and the reason to me seems glaringly obvious: every one of those kids is PLANNED PARENTHOOD in action!\n\nFrank discussions about reproductive health are tainted by this country\u2019s fear of sexuality\u2014a fear that the marriage equality movement was able to redirect. Can it work for women\u2019s rights, too? I hope so, for my nine-year-old daughter\u2019s sake.\n\nWhat\u2019s the easiest thing a parent can do on an individual level to help further the feminist movement?\n\nTalking to your kids and the kids in your life! Kids are already absorbing tremendous amounts of information about the world as they walk in it and parents have many opportunities to bring up gender disparities in ways that kids understand. In the book I talk about how I pointed out to my son that pink Legos were ridiculous, because Legos (like all toys, really) are for everyone. Today, both my son and my daughter have very sharp gendered BS detectors. And as fierce a feminist as Beyonce is, I do have to point out to my kids that it\u2019s weird that there are much different expectations for her performance clothing than for her husband Jay-Z.\n\nI would like to mention that I am beating the drum for abortion rights so heavily in this interview because I am currently rereading Margaret Atwood\u2019s The Handmaid\u2019s Tale ahead of visiting a 12th grade literature class at my son\u2019s high school. The instructor was thrilled to discover that a professional feminist was in the school community and asked me to share my perspective on how near we are to a Republic of Gilead today. The book is fantastic of course, but it has me seeing red handmaid outfits everywhere. Margaret Atwood wasn\u2019t paranoid; she was prescient.\n\nThe Radical Housewife is available now.
