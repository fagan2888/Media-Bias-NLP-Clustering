Comcast is one of its biggest distributors, he says.\n\nUsers create an account (a process Jackson says \u201ctakes 30 seconds), input their symptoms and are then routed to a board-certified doctor within the area.\n\n\u201cYou can see each other face to face and the notes you entered beforehand are revealed,\u201d Jackson says. \u201cIf it\u2019s medically appropriate, the doctor can submit a prescription for you at the pharmacy of your choosing.\u201d\n\nThe company hasn\u2019t released its customer information, but Jackson says it has 1,400 doctors nationwide working on the platform, with several hundred taking shifts at any given moment.\n\n\u201cFive years ago, this was nearly impossible, but video has become an important component of diagnosing people and many states have adopted new rules to allow video if you won\u2019t be there in person,\u201d he says.\n\nLinkous says the videos telemedicine companies use are encrypted, so patient information is protected.\n\nTelemedicine technology will also make lives easier for patients in rural communities, who may lack access to care, says Vishnu Lekraj, senior health insurance analyst for Morningstar.\n\n\u201cIt can help them in terms of having to shell out for an expensive trip to a specialist. In terms of video conferences, it can help in screening providers or establishing better communication between doctors and patients without the expense of traveling.\u201d\n\nThe technology won\u2019t, however, displace regular doctors or providers, Lekraj says. Instead it will add to their service offerings, and likely bring down the tab for both parties.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s for better communication between providers, allows for data sharing and overall better technological integration will lead to more efficiency and eventually lower costs,\u201d he says. \u201cWith payers and providers looking to lower expenses, technology will play a critical role.\u201d\n\nObamaCare has also placed added strain on physicians, Jackson says, as they work to see more patients due to an influx of insured Americans. The average wait time for a doctor\u2019s appointment in the U.S. is 20 days, according to Jackson.\n\n\u201cIn 20 days, your sinus infection will have run its course,\u201d Jackson says. \u201cOur solution allows you to jump the line.\u201d\n\nWhile the convenience of telemedicine is attractive, it remains to be seen if consumers will feel comfortable enough to actively to communicate health issues online.\n\n\u201cThere have been thousands of studies on patient acceptance,\u201d he says. \u201cThere has never been a single study where patients don\u2019t like telemedicine. In fact, they like the fact that they have access to a better doctor if they want. They can choose to see a doctor far from their home\u2014there\u2019s tons of benefits for patients, so what\u2019s not to love?\u201d", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.modified": "2016-01-08 10:15:17 EST", "dc.type": "Text.Article", "twitter": {"url": "http://www.foxbusiness.com/features/2014/08/13/diagnosing-flu-via-skype-telemedicine-poised-to-take-off.html", "image": "http://a57.foxnews.com/media.foxbusiness.com/thumbnails/081314/0/0/081314_fb_rogers.jpg?ve=1", "description": "Telemedicine is several years old, but analysts say a perfect storm of resources and patient influxes have made the time right for the technology to take off.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Diagnosing the Flu via Skype: Telemedicine Poised to Take Off"}, "dc.format": "text/html", "dc.publisher": "Fox Business", "parsely-metadata": "{\"author\":\"Kate Rogers\",\"subSection\":\"features\",\"title\":\"Diagnosing the Flu via Skype: Telemedicine Poised to Take Off\",\"image_url\":\"http://a57.foxnews.com/media.foxbusiness.com/thumbnails/081314/0/0/081314_fb_rogers.jpg?ve=1\",\"pub_date\":\"2014-08-13T15:19:50Z\",\"link\":\"http://www.foxbusiness.com/features/2014/08/13/diagnosing-flu-via-skype-telemedicine-poised-to-take-off.html\",\"type\":\"article\",\"identifier\":\"7a2f03ee-7052-49b2-992b-a0d96b9acb2e\",\"section\":\"features\"}", "prism.aggregationType": "subsection", "description": "Telemedicine is several years old, but analysts say a perfect storm of resources and patient influxes have made the time right for the technology to take off.", "dc.description": "Telemedicine is several years old, but analysts say a perfect storm of resources and patient influxes have made the time right for the technology to take off.", "dc.identifier": "7a2f03ee-7052-49b2-992b-a0d96b9acb2e", "dc.language": "en-US", "pagetype": "article", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://global.fncstatic.com/static/cq/fb/img/all/mediumtile.png", "prism.channel": "fbn", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://global.fncstatic.com/static/cq/fb/img/all/widetile.png", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://global.fncstatic.com/static/cq/fb/img/all/smalltile.png", "prism.section": "features", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://global.fncstatic.com/static/cq/fb/img/all/largetile.png", "fb": {"app_id": 116027085089150}, "dc.source": "FOXBusiness", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "dc.title": "Diagnosing The Flu Via Skype: Telemedicine Poised To Take Off", "dcterms.created": "2016-01-08 10:15:17 EST", "og": {"site_name": "Fox Business", "description": "Telemedicine is several years old, but analysts say a perfect storm of resources and patient influxes have made the time right for the technology to take off.", "title": "Diagnosing the Flu via Skype: Telemedicine Poised to Take Off | Fox Business", "url": "http://www.foxbusiness.com/features/2014/08/13/diagnosing-flu-via-skype-telemedicine-poised-to-take-off.html", "image": "http://a57.foxnews.com/media.foxbusiness.com/thumbnails/081314/0/0/081314_fb_rogers.jpg?ve=1", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.abstract": "Telemedicine is several years old, but analysts say a perfect storm of resources and patient influxes have made the time right for the technology to take off.", "dc.date": "2014-08-13", "parsely-page": "{\"author\":\"Kate Rogers\",\"subSection\":\"features\",\"title\":\"Diagnosing the Flu via Skype: Telemedicine Poised to Take Off\",\"image_url\":\"http://a57.foxnews.com/media.foxbusiness.com/thumbnails/081314/0/0/081314_fb_rogers.jpg?ve=1\",\"pub_date\":\"2014-08-13T15:19:50Z\",\"link\":\"http://www.foxbusiness.com/features/2014/08/13/diagnosing-flu-via-skype-telemedicine-poised-to-take-off.html\",\"post_id\":\"7a2f03ee-7052-49b2-992b-a0d96b9acb2e\",\"type\":\"article\",\"section\":\"features\"}", "dc.creator": "Kate Rogers"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcaacb\"", "article_summary": "Currently, 12 million Americans are being served in some form by telemedicine technology, and that number is expected to double by 2015, according to the ATA.\nIn fact, they like the fact that they have access to a better doctor if they want.\nTelemedicine technology will also make lives easier for patients in rural communities, who may lack access to care, says Vishnu Lekraj, senior health insurance analyst for Morningstar.\nPrices on the technology that allows telemedicine have come down, but still vary greatly depending on the doctor, the size of the operation and how its being used, Linkous explains.\n\u201cIt\u2019s for better communication between providers, allows for data sharing and overall better technological integration will lead to more efficiency and eventually lower costs,\u201d he says."}
