Now Open: Woodys Classic Sports Pub Jeff and Eric, the owners of Hamburger Marys and Industry Video Bar now have their third bar open -- Woodys Classic Sports Pub -- one block away at 3740 Broadway. It opened to the general public on Aug. 17. The bar has been completely restyled with expert design assistance from Wonderlands Andy Chambers and Alan Dunham and it looks fantastic.



Woodys also has a small kitchen and serves a bar menu. As youd expect from a gay sports bar, there are TVs in every room and they have a great patio. The bar opens daily at 4 p.m. and it has a 3 a.m. license, so its a great place for either happy hour or late-night fun. They plan to have a grand opening party sometime in the next few weeks. Like them on Facebook for more information. Community Healing Event After Tamara Dominguezs Death

held on Aug. 30 Kansas City Anti-Violence Project, Una Lucha KC, the Justice Project and One Struggle KC are calling for action and healing in response to the murder of Tamara Dominguez, a transgender Latina woman, on Aug. 15 in Kansas City, Mo.



KCAVP reported on her death in this press release:



Tamara was intentionally run over three times by a large vehicle, sending a threatening, direct message of hate towards other trans women and the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer (LGBTQ) Latin@ communities in Kansas City. Our organizations are working collectively together to help support and advocate with Tamaras chosen family and friends.



Tamara was loved and cherished by her chosen family. She is survived by her partner of six years and her four dogsLuna, Travis, Sensei and Arigato.



Her partner said, She was happy with who she was.



Dominguez was cherished for her smile and her laugh and was known as a sweet, gentle and generous person, the press release said. She was a beloved cook, and her partner and chosen family loved her shrimp ceviche and empanadas. Her friends said they wanted the focus on who did this, not on her being transgender.



The release stated that Dominguezs chosen family wishes for her body to remain in the United States, but that her relatives may take her remains to Mexico. It goes on: Her chosen family is collecting donations for memorial services for Tamara, as well as supporting her partner and community through this process of grief and healing. KCAVP, Una Lucha KC and the Justice Project are planning a series of community healing events and support groups for the communities most impacted by this violence. The first event was on Sunday, Aug. 30. Check this Facebook page for updates: facebook.com/kcavp.



Anyone who identifies as transgender or LGBQ and is grieving about this brutal murder is encouraged to reach out to KCAVP for free support and advocacy services. Help is available by calling 816-561-0550 or emailing info@kcavp.org. Mid-America Gay & Lesbian Chamber of Commerce Receives National Award The Mid-America Gay & Lesbian Chamber of Commerce (MAGLCC) was honored Aug. 13 with the Rising Star Chamber Award at the National Gay & Lesbian Chamber of Commerces 2015 International Business & Leadership Conference in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. The Rising Star Award is given to a chamber that exhibits vitality and relevance in its community, brings a unified voice to the LGBT business community and its allies, and proves its commitment to the broader national business equality movement. The professional support that NGLCC leadership has shared with us over these first four years has been incredible and one of the key reasons we are out for business today. This recognition is very important to us, said Dan Nilsen, founder and board president of MAGLCC. In addition to the growing number of passionate members, our success is also due to our corporate sponsor partners. Kansas City was definitely ready to support our new chamber. Just about every major corporation in the Metro Kansas City area enthusiastically agreed to join our efforts to ensure that LGBT professionals and entrepreneurs are able to bring their whole selves to work. Chance Mitchell, NGLCC co-founder and CEO, said, Mid-America GLCC has experienced incredible growth in members and corporate partners over the past few years, and they have pioneered new programs and advocacy efforts to engage with the local business community. We are excited to see what they will do in the future. The Mid-America Gay & Lesbian Chamber of Commerce advocates, promotes and facilitates the success of the LGBT business community and its allies through the guiding principles of equality, inclusion, economics and education. Mid-America GLCCs purpose is to create, identify and enhance business opportunities for LGBT and LGBT-friendly organizations, thereby fostering a more inclusive and vibrant economy in the Midwest.

Federal Health Center Designation The Kansas City CARE Clinic (formerly the Kansas City Free Health Clinic), a private, nonprofit community health center, was designated in August by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services as a Federally Qualified Health Center (FQHC). With this designation, the clinic will receive annual federal funds of about $650,000, which will greatly expand its capacity to provide high-quality primary care for those who need it in the Kansas City region. News of this designation arrived shortly after U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia M. Burwell announced $169 million in Affordable Care Act funding to 266 new health-center sites in 46 states for the delivery of comprehensive primary health-care services in communities that need them most. These new health centers are projected to increase access to health care for nearly 1.2 million patients nationwide, adding to the more than 700 new health-center sites supported through the Affordable Care Act. The Kansas City CARE Clinic has provided critical community health services in the Kansas City area for more than four decades, said U.S. Rep. Emanuel Cleaver. I am pleased that they have earned status as a fully fledged FQHC. The Affordable Care Act established $11 billion in additional funding to increase and expand the operation and construction of health centers throughout the nation. This is a great opportunity to ensure we are taking care of the areas most vulnerable. As a safety net provider in the Kansas City metro for more than 44 years, the KC CARE Clinic has always been committed to providing high-quality, culturally competent primary care and reducing health disparities in the underinsured and uninsured populations. With nearly 250,000 individuals estimated to need access to primary care in the Kansas City metro, the KC CARE Clinic views itself as a leader in HIV services and an essential regional partner, collaborating for years with the areas other FQHCs, community safety-net clinics, health-care providers, regional foundations, and civic leaders to help address this larger community need. The clinic also received notification that it has been recognized as a Patient-Centered Medical Home by the National Committee for Quality Assurance, which is a private, nonprofit organization dedicated to improving health-care quality. Its standards were established with the American College of Physicians, the American Academy of Family Physicians, the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Osteopathic Association. The safety net for Kansas City is now stronger with the clinic becoming both an FQHC and a Patient-Centered Medical Home, said Sheri Wood, chief executive officer of the KC CARE Clinic. These significant designations are the next steps in our evolution as we respond to the rapidly changing health-care environment that exists today. LIKEME Lighthouse Events The LIKEME Lighthouse reports that it will be closed, starting Friday, Sept. 4, for Labor Day weekend, and will open back up on Tuesday, Sept. 8.
