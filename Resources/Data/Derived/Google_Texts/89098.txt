Representatives from several critical access hospitals in northcentral Montana gathered Thursday in Great Falls for the first day of the North Central Montana Healthcare Alliance regional governance conference.

The governance conference addresses topics its members consider timely and related to management of small, rural hospitals.

On Thursday afternoon, the group of CEOs and board members listened to perspectives on regional affiliation and population health management for rural hospitals, both issues that affect hospitals with thin break-even margins.

Providing education to the administration of rural hospitals is key to the conference, NMHA president Jack King said.

“We want as high a level (of education here) as we can get,” King said.

Changes in the health care landscape in the past several years, including the Affordable Care Act, changes in Medicare reimbursements and new information technology requirements, have thrown the health care industry for a loop and provided new challenges for small, rural hospitals.

“Health care is only getting more complicated, and it’s not going to get any easier,” King said.

Topics covered are those that hospital administrators consider most valuable in today’s market.

Friday begins a provider conference, another two-day event that includes lectures by health care professionals on topics chosen by rural doctors.
