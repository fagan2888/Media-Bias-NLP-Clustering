Only Mississippi Medicaid dentists get reimbursed less than Californians, a ranking that didn\u2019t happen overnight. And it\u2019s not just benign neglect, although state lawmakers didn\u2019t bother raising the reimbursement rate for about a decade.\n\nState lawmakers actively reduced rates 10% for children\u2019s services in 2013 (since reversed) and totally eliminated adult services in 2009 (since partially reversed) as part of a slash-and-burn budgetary response to the Great Recession. The results of this public policy choice are predictable and, indeed, illustrated in a growing body of literature about how people fare without dental care and what the cost to society is.\n\nCalifornia\u2019s Department of Health Care Services (DHCS) made its contribution in an annual report (pdf) required by lawmakers when it calculated that, despite a 40% increase in the number of children enrolled in the Denti-Cal (Medicaid) program between 2009 and 2014, there were 14% fewer dentists willing to treat them.\n\nAlicia Malaby, communications director at the California Dental Association told California HealthLine, \u201cBased on the significant increase in beneficiaries covered and the decrease in the providers in the network during the same time period one can easily conclude that access to care is problematic in the Denti-Cal program.\u201d\n\nBut the DHCS would beg to differ. Its introduction to \u201cMedi-Cal Dental Services Rate Review\u201d argues that it\u2019s complicated: \u201cA reimbursement rate and its relationship to beneficiary access is not a strict or linear one.\u201d The report argues that a \u201cmultitude of factors\u201d must be considered and addressed. Just raising the reimbursement rate won\u2019t do, although the review shies away from drawing conclusions.\n\nJennifer Kattlove, senior director of programs at The Children's Partnership, didn\u2019t buy that. \u201cIt's missing the most important piece of information\u2014how rates affect access.\u201d\n\nA lot of children from low-income homes are not seeing dentists. The California State Auditor reported in December (pdf) that 56% of the 5.1 million children enrolled in Medi-Cal (California\u2019s version of Medicaid) received dental care through the program in 2013. The Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) expanded the rolls of the insured but not necessarily access to doctors and dentists.\n\nFive California counties lacked any dentists serving Denti-Cal patients, 11 had no dentists who were accepting new Denti-Cal patients and 16 had too few amenable dentists overall.\n\nThe audit said DHCS had failed to properly monitor the program chastised it for not doing the mandatory annual report it finally released this month. Unlike the DHCS, the auditor had no problem cutting through the issue\u2019s complexity to conclude: \u201cA primary reason for low dental provider participation rates is low reimbursement rates.\u201d\n\nAssemblyman Jim Wood told the Sacramento Bee back in April, when he and fellow Democrat Senator Richard Pan asked the independent Little Hoover Commission to study Denti-Cal and suggest ways to make it more effective, \u201cThese are the most vulnerable people in our society, and we\u2019re judged on how we treat the most vulnerable people.\u201d\n\nYes we are, and by now the verdict is pretty clear. It may be on appeal but the overwhelming evidence is that the California body politic doesn\u2019t care that much about dental needs of low-income people.\n\n\u2013Ken Broder\n\nTo Learn More:\n\nState's Rate Review Shows Fewer Dental Providers Take Medi-Cal Patients (by David Gorn, California HealthLine)\n\nCalifornia\u2019s Dental Program Gains Patients While Losing Dentists (by Kenny Goldberg, KPBS)\n\nEfforts To Improve Denti-Cal Heat Up (by Hudson Sangree, Sacramento Bee)\n\nReport Shows Denti-Cal Reimbursement Rates Lagging (California Dental Association)\n\n335 California Dental Providers Post Suspiciously Amazing Medi-Cal Numbers (by Ken Broder, AllGov California)\n\nMedi-Cal Dental Services Rate Review (California Department of Health Care Services) (pdf)", "article_metadata": {"description": "A lot of children from low-income homes are not seeing dentists.
