That support helped spur the development process of Tennessee Standards, and that is what I support.\u201d\n\nStances on health care and education are the primary differences between the two Republicans wanting the state\u2019s 14th House District seat in West Knox County.\n\nKaren Carson supports Insure Tennessee, Gov. Bill Haslam\u2019s proposal to expand federal health care to the state\u2019s uninsured, while Jason Zachary does not. Carson backs components of Common Core standards for educating public school students, Zachary does not.\n\nOtherwise, as both acknowledged in Thursday\u2019s debate at Farragut Town Hall, the two tend to agree on protecting gun rights, and being anti-abortion.\n\n\u201cMany issues, we are in agreement on,\u201d Carson said.\n\nBoth are wary of increasing the state\u2019s gasoline tax.\n\nWhat little clashing occurred during the debate came on the discussions over health care and education in Tennessee.\n\nZachary, who works in a telecommunications brokerage business, linked Insure Tennessee to Medicaid, which he said he believes is an expansion of the federal government into the state\u2019s affairs. He opposes the Affordable Care Act implemented by President Barack Obama\u2019s administration. He admitted that health care for the uninsured is a problem, but didn\u2019t outline any plan to assist the uninsured.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want to make a bad situation worse by grossly expanding government,\u201d Zachary said.\n\nCarson, a pediatric nurse, drew on her medical experience in supporting Insure Tennessee. She said that the plan would cover up to 240,000 uninsured Tennesseans who opt in to the program.\n\n\u201cGov. Haslam has worked to come up with a Tennessee plan, not an Obama plan,\u201d she said. \u201cI believe that this is a reasonable solution. \u2026 Our hospitals cannot continue to assume the costs of the uninsured.\u201d\n\nCarson, a member of the Knox County school board, also said that Common Core regulations have helped show where Tennessee students stand in their education level compared to the rest of the country. She added, however, that any policy does need to be reviewed after it is implemented.\n\nZachary primarily suggested that in matters of federal government and the state, the state and local school systems she be left to determine their own fate.\n\nThen he suggested the state adopt a plan from Americans for Prosperity \u2014 a conservative political advocacy group founded by billionaire brothers David and Charles Koch.\n\nCarson, in rebuttal, keyed in on the helpfulness from a national group.\n\n\u201cA national organization may have some good ideas, but that\u2019s a national solution,\u201d she said. \u201cTennessee needs a Tennessee solution.\u201d\n\nWith one day of early voting left before Wednesday\u2019s election, former Knoxville Mayor Victor Ashe compared the special election to speed-dating in what he predicted to be a low turnout race.\n\n\u201cWhoever has the best network of supporters will prevail,\u201d he said.\n\nWith no Democrat seeking the House seat, Wednesday\u2019s Republican primary will effectively decide who fulfills the final year of former state Rep. Ryan Haynes\u2019 term. Haynes vacated the seat earlier this year to become chairman of the Tennessee Republican Party.", "article_metadata": {"title": "Debate reveals conservative candidates' differences", "og": {"url": "http://www.knoxnews.com/news/politics/debate-reveals-conservative-candidates-differences-ep-1220181172-362073751.html", "image": {"width": 362, "identifier": "http://media.jrn.com/images/debate_op_2_cp__22407776_ver1.0_640_480.jpg", "height": 480}, "type": "article", "description": "Stances on health care and education are the primary differences between the two Republicans wanting the state\u2019s 14th House District seat in West Knox County.", "title": "Debate reveals conservative candidates' differences"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.jrn.com/images/debate_op_2_cp__22407776_ver1.0_640_480.jpg", "description": "Stances on health care and education are the primary differences between the two Republicans wanting the state\u2019s 14th House District seat in West Knox County.", "site": "https://twitter.com/knoxnews", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Debate reveals conservative candidates' differences"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://media.jrn.com/designimages/logo-kns-icon-144.png", "__sync_contentCategory": "premium", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe270f\"", "article_summary": "What little clashing occurred during the debate came on the discussions over health care and education in Tennessee.\nHaslam has worked to come up with a Tennessee plan, not an Obama plan,\u201d she said.\nCarson backs components of Common Core standards for educating public school students, Zachary does not.\nBill Haslam\u2019s proposal to expand federal health care to the state\u2019s uninsured, while Jason Zachary does not.\nHe admitted that health care for the uninsured is a problem, but didn\u2019t outline any plan to assist the uninsured."}
