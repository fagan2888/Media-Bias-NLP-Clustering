Furthermore, ANP ambulances were not stocked with necessary equipment and supplies and not properly utilized to transport casualties to the next level of trauma care.\n\nThe report painted a picture of Afghan security forces often unprepared for medical care on the chaotic, front lines of war.\n\nANP personnel were unable to render effective point-of-injury care to wounded colleagues because the majority of personnel did not have first aid kits or access to vital medical equipment like tourniquets and pressure dressings, the report said.\n\nAlthough training was provided not all designated ANP staff attended the training and lacked the skills to treat wounds on the battlefield.\n\nIn addition, the report noted that there were not enough trained pharmacists to effectively supply medications for patients at hospitals and that ANP facilities often lacked the resources required to treat patients, thus forcing them to transfer to outside facilities, the investigators warned.\n\nAccording to the report, the ANP hospital, a 74-bed facility, had increased capacity to 161 beds in September 2013 without any increase in medical personnel.\n\nFurthermore, the ANP Office of the Surgeon General requires further assistance to provide effective oversight of medical activities within the Ministry of the Interior, according to the report.\n\nThe Inspector General did commend the Afghan Air Force for its progress in developing casualty evacuation programs and improved relations among Government of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan organizations, which have had a positive effect on healthcare developments.\n\nThe inspector general recommended that responsible offices within the Pentagon ensure that sufficient medical personnel, including pharmacists, are hired and trained to carry out proper emergency medical care and that supplies and equipment be provided.\n\nManagement agreed with all but one of the Inspector\u2019s recommendations. Investigators suggested implementing an additional eight-week training course for ANP medics if needed. But defense officials argued that there is already a lack of commitment by Afghan forces to sending staff to the lengthy training.\n\n\u201cThere is little confidence that changing the course will improve AND attendance. We suggest that the first priority is to get ANP leaders to commit to send their medics to [trauma assistance personnel training] and then keep them as medics,\u201d Colonel Steven Merkel, NATO Training-Mission-Afghanistan Chief of Staff, wrote in an official response.\n\nThe Inspector General noted that while management agreed to make improvements and follow the investigators\u2019 recommendations, they did not lay out specific plan designs for improvement and wrote that further comments are required.", "article_metadata": {"description": "As U.S. troops withdraw, Afghan security forces exhibit a stunning lack of ability for their own wounded, Pentagon report finds.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "As U.S. troops withdraw, Afghan security forces exhibit a stunning lack of ability for their own wounded, Pentagon report finds.", "title": "Afghan security forces poorly equipped to treat wounded: Pentagon", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/may/24/afghan-security-forces-poorly-equipped-treat-wound/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/05/24/afghanistan-electionsjpeg-08454.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/05/24/afghanistan-electionsjpeg-08454.jpg", "description": "As U.S. troops withdraw, Afghan security forces exhibit a stunning lack of ability for their own wounded, Pentagon report finds.", "card": "summary", "title": "Afghan security forces poorly equipped to treat wounded: Pentagon"}, "Author": "Kellan Howell", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "War Conflict, Health Medical Pharma, Afghan National Police, Pentagon, Afghan Air Force"}, "article_summary": "The report painted a picture of Afghan security forces often unprepared for medical care on the chaotic, front lines of war.\nDespite a decade of battle, Afghan security forces remain poorly equipped to care for their wounded, according to a Pentagon report that provides the latest stark warning about the American withdrawal from that war-torn country.\nThe report, released late Friday on the eve of America\u2019s Memorial Day celebration of its own veterans, faults U.S. advisers for not focusing more on the care of Afghan security forces as U.S troops begin their pullout.\nBut defense officials argued that there is already a lack of commitment by Afghan forces to sending staff to the lengthy training.\nThe Inspector General noted that while management agreed to make improvements and follow the investigators\u2019 recommendations, they did not lay out specific plan designs for improvement and wrote that further comments are required."}
