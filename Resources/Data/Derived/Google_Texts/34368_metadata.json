But, a panel of lawmakers got a bit of a preview Wednesday.\n\nHours before Phoebe Jonchuck was thrown over a bridge allegedly by her father, the state\u2019s child abuse hotline received a warning call that went ignored. It\u2019s a call that\u2019s gotten quite a bit of media attention.\n\nBut, speaking to members of the House Children, Families, and Seniors subcommittee Wednesday, Florida Department of Children and Families Secretary Mike Carroll says that wasn\u2019t the only warning.\n\n\u201cOne of the things that\u2019s kind of anomaly in there is we did have not one, but two hotline calls\u2014one: the day everyone knows about that call. We also received a call. I\u2019m not sure the date because I don\u2019t have the report in front of me, but I think it was the week before. In hindsight, looking at those calls, we should have accepted them both, and we probably should have accepted them both and we probably should have initiated an investigation on dad,\u201d said Carroll.\n\nCarroll says the report will also highlight what he calls \u201csystemic issues.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe second piece of this is it looks at the history of what we did in that case,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd, it does appear we had issues in that assessment of that case. And, Dad was allowed custody of that child, and there were really no services put in place for that child. And, so, you\u2019ll see that\u2019s going to be a finding too.\u201d\n\nCarroll says he expects the full findings of what went wrong in Phoebe\u2019s case to be done by Monday at the latest.\n\nFor more news updates, follow Sascha Cordner on Twitter: @SaschaCordner.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"category": "HNF Stories", "description": "Listen \n        Listening...", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://health.wusf.usf.edu/post/dcf-head-carroll-briefs-lawmakers-latest-5-year-olds-tragic-death", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/shared/npr/styles/medium/nprshared/201502/383880111.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Listen \n        Listening...", "title": "DCF Head Carroll Briefs Lawmakers On Latest In 5-Year-Old's Tragic Death"}, "story_id": 383880082, "twitter": {"site": "@HealthNewsFL", "card": "summary", "creator": "@HealthNewsFL"}, "author": "Sascha Cordner", "org_id": 390, "dc": {"title": "DCF Head Carroll Briefs Lawmakers On Latest In 5-Year-Old&#039;s Tragic Death"}, "nid": 9474, "datePublished": "2015-02-05", "keywords": "Department of Children and Families, Phoebe Jonchuck, John Jonchuck, child abuse, child deaths", "wordCount": 480, "has_audio": 1, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbe5c\"", "article_summary": "Hours before Phoebe Jonchuck was thrown over a bridge allegedly by her father, the state\u2019s child abuse hotline received a warning call that went ignored.\nAnd, Dad was allowed custody of that child, and there were really no services put in place for that child.\nIn less than a week, officials will publish a state report asking whether the tragic death of a little girl last month could have been prevented as part of an investigation.\nBut, a panel of lawmakers got a bit of a preview Wednesday.\nI\u2019m not sure the date because I don\u2019t have the report in front of me, but I think it was the week before."}
