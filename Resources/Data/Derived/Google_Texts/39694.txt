Is it us, or is Pantelion Studios on fire right now? The company behind the smash Instructions Not Included and this week’s Pulling Strings is continuing their rise to the top of the film chain via a new partnership with George Lopez.

George just signed a major production deal with Pantelion, which will have him producing and starring in a string of upcoming films. His first project is a movie called La Vida Robot, which is based on a true story about Latino inventors.

Lopez already has a strong relationship with Pantelion’s parent company, Lionsgate. They are behind his upcoming Saint George TV show and clearly have a lot of faith in his talents.

“George is a comic superstar and brand name in the Latino community,” Lionsgate rep Paul Presburger said. “He reflects the kind of A-list Latino film and TV talent we’re recruiting for Pantelion.”
