(Photo: Salwan Georges, Detroit Free Press)Buy Photo\n\nWith his wife preparing for Sunday\u2019s Democratic debate in Flint, former President Bill Clinton on Saturday kicked off a rally of union canvassers in Detroit preparing to go door-to-door in search of votes, outlining Hillary Clinton's economic and social policies to help make their case.\n\nPraising President Barack Obama\u2019s last State of the Union address in which he painted \u201cthis beautiful picture\u201d of the progress made in the last seven years, Bill Clinton said the problem is that too many Americans still \u201clook at that pretty picture and (can\u2019t) find themselves to save their lives.\u201d\n\nDespite huge strides in making health care more accessible and bolstering the economy and Michigan\u2019s dominant auto industry, Clinton said for many Americans there remains a \u201cdisconnect\u201d over stagnant wages, college debts and businesses moving overseas that his wife, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, has concrete plans to address.\n\n\u201cHillary is running for president to put everybody in the picture,\u201d he said to a cheering crowd of about 200 people at the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees Council 25\u2019s auditorium in Detroit. \u201cIt\u2019s as simple as that.\u201d\n\nAfter the speech, the former president, who said he was hoarse after having \u201clost my voice in service of my candidate,\u201d was set to help whip up the vote in Detroit before Saturday night\u2019s Michigan Democratic Party event at the fund-raiser at the MGM Grand. Hillary Clinton is set to meet rival U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont in a CNN-hosted debate in Flint at 8 p.m. Sunday.\n\nPolls have suggested Hillary Clinton has a big lead over Sanders in Tuesday\u2019s Democratic primary in Michigan, but she seems to be leaving little to chance: On Friday, she visited auto supplier Detroit Manufacturing Systems and delivered an economic address lamenting the decline of labor unions and criticized Chinese trade practices and deals in which companies move overseas to avoid taxes.\n\nIn Saturday\u2019s speech, her husband Bill reiterated part of that address, noting that she has proposed clawing back tax breaks and other government aid given to companies if they decide to move overseas. Meanwhile, he also outlined proposals to allow college debts to be refinanced and students to graduate from certain schools debt-free.\n\nMuch of the speech and those leading up to Bill Clinton\u2019s address also dealt with Flint, where both candidates have decried actions \u2014 or the lack thereof \u2014 that led to high lead levels in the tap water being detected there.\n\nBill Clinton noted that Sanders, too, has drawn attention to the public health crisis in Flint, and Clinton said he was \u201cproud to be a Democrat because of the way both of them have responded.\u201d But he noted correctly that Hillary Clinton did so first, reaching out to Mayor Karen Weaver months ago and asking how she could help. Weaver has endorsed Clinton.\n\nWhile not specifically mentioning Sanders\u2019 own proposals, Bill Clinton quietly criticized them: Sanders, for instance, has called for tuition-free education at public colleges and universities, but Clinton said his wife\u2019s debt-free proposal is better and it only make sense for students from higher-income families to continue paying.\n\nAnd while Sanders has called for a \u201cMedicare-for-all\u201d plan to insure all Americans, Bill Clinton said that with Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act already reaching 90% of the population, it makes more sense to tweak and improve that \u2014 especially with Republican numbers in Congress \u2014 rather than trying to replace it with a different plan.\n\n\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s the best change maker I\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d Bill Clinton said, adding that while Sanders has supported admirable policies, \u201cYou\u2019ve got to pick a president.\u201d\n\nChelsea Clinton, Bill and Hillary\u2019s daughter, was expected to be campaigning for her mom in Michigan on Sunday ahead of the Flint debate. Meanwhile, Hillary Clinton also has agreed to participate in a town hall meeting to be broadcast by Fox News Channel on Monday night from Detroit\u2019s Gem Theatre, beginning at 6 p.m. It will mark her first appearance on the Fox News Channel in two years.\n\nContact Todd Spangler: 703-854-8947 or at tspangler@freepress.com.
