And even at 15.2% of the S&P, healthcare stocks still make up less than the 17.4% that healthcare spending contributed to U.S. gross domestic product in 2013, the most recently aggregated data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis.\n\nListening for answers at the conference will be roughly 3,000 investors like Les Funtleyder, healthcare portfolio manager for E Squared Asset Management in New York.\n\n\u201cFor the first part of the year, [the conference is] actually very important,\u201d said Funtleyder. \u201cIt sets the tone.\u201d\n\nJP Morgan says it expects roughly 9,000 attendees and presentations from more than 400 biotech, pharmaceutical, medical device, health insurance and other healthcare companies, a similar amount to last year.\n\nAs individual companies take the podium at the conference, their shares could gyrate significantly.\n\nFor example, Celgene (NSDQ:CELG), which saw its stock soar 17% during the week of the conference in 2013 after it issued a long-term outlook, is among companies expected to give key financial data this year, along with rival large-cap biotech firms Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (NSDQ:REGN) and Vertex Pharmaceuticals (NSDQ:VRTX).\n\nThe climate for deals \u2013 including those already struck and the outlook for more consolidation \u2013 will also be in focus.\n\nTop executives at insurers Anthem and Aetna, both of which are trying to gain clearance for massive acquisitions, could give investors more confidence those deals will pass anti-trust scrutiny.\n\nSure enough, Shire (NSDQ:SHPGY) announced a $32 billion cash-and-stock deal to acquire fellow rare disease drugmakerBaxalta (NYSE:BXLT), the spinout of Baxter\u2018s (NYSE:BAX) biopharmaceuticals division.\n\nThe conference could also shed light on whether the sector can sustain its feverish deal-making pace.\n\nHealthcare stocks have gotten swept up in the broader market carnage that started 2016, with the S&P healthcare sector down 5.6% through Jan. 8 against a 6% slide for the S&P 500.\n\nSince 2000, healthcare has topped the S&P\u2019s performance in 7 of the past 10 Januarys, including the past 3. The NASDAQ Biotechnology index has been even stronger, besting the S&P 500 in January in 9 of the past 10 years, good for an average rise of 3.7% over that time against a -0.9% dip for stocks more broadly.\n\nInvestors will be listening for guidance on how healthcare companies are approaching regulatory and political risks facing much of the healthcare sector.\n\nPharmaceutical and biotech companies are likely to endure more criticism over pricing practices, especially as the 2016 presidential campaign heats up.\n\n\u201cAs an industry, we are looking at a potentially very significant political disruption this year, and I think there\u2019s a risk factor that has to be compensated for,\u201d said Brad McMillan, chief investment officer at Commonwealth Financial Network in Waltham, Mass. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be an area I would overweight.\u201d\n\nThe outlook for the Affordable Care Act, President Barack Obama\u2019s healthcare program known as Obamacare, will also be in focus after some hospital chains posted weak 3rd-quarter results that suggested diminishing benefits from the program, and top insurer UnitedHealth Group said in November it might drop out of the individual insurance exchanges created under the ACA.\n\n\u201cGetting a sense of what their outlook is for Q1 is going to be important,\u201d said Bihag Patel, senior research analyst at Nuveen Asset Management in Minneapolis.", "article_metadata": {"com.silverpop.brandeddomains": "www.pages02.net,3dcadforums.com,3dcadworld.com,analogictips.com,connectortips.com,couplingtips.com,datasheetpro.com,designworldonline.com,devicetalks.com,digitalsignalprocessingtips.com,edaboard.com,eeworldonline.com,electro-tech-online.com,engineeringexchange.com,engineeringwhitepapers.com,fluidpowerworld.com,fpgatips.com,hoseassemblytips.com,linearmotiontips.com,makepartsfast.com,massdevice.com,mcadcentral.com,mechatronictips.com,medicaldesignandoutsourcing.com,microcontrollertips.com,mobilehydraulictips.com,motioncontroltips.com,page.wtwhmedia.com,pneumatictips.com,powerelectronictips.com,sensortips.com,solarpowerworldonline.com,testandmeasurementtips.com,windpowerengineering.com,wireandcabletips.com", "og": {"site_name": "MassDevice", "description": "(Reuters) \u2014\u00a0Healthcare investors can expect a volatile week starting today, when the sector\u2019s biggest financial event hits San Francisco.
