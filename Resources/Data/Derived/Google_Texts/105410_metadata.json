AMA!\u201d appeared on the news-conversation website Reddit. Hosted by a user named \u201ckarnim\u201d who identified himself only as a college-aged male research-and-development intern at one of the \u201cbig three\u201d tampon brands (Tampax, Kotex, and Playtex), the thread began with a polite invitation to \u201cask me anything\u201d (AMA) and a disclaimer. \u201cMuch of my work is confidential, so I can't give details about my projects,\u201d karnim wrote, but he could answer \u201coverall\u201d questions about tampons.\n\nIn the grander canon of AMA threads\u2014online Q&A sessions hosted by Reddit users with compelling life stories or careers\u2014karnim\u2019s wasn\u2019t the most glamorous or flashy. President Obama, for example, participated in an AMA in 2012. But karnim soon found himself avalanched with reader questions about tampon technology, ranging from the curious (\u201cWhy don't they just stop making the cardboard ones?\u201d) to the wisecracking (\u201cCan you make medicated tampons to make women stop actin\u2019 fool when they get their menses?\u201d) to the imploring (\u201cCan you please make tampons with a black or flesh-coloured string? Please?\u201d \u201cHow about one that you can leave in for 10 hours and not worry about it?\u201d).\n\nTen hours later, karnim ended his IAmA, exhausted. \u201cSorry y'all, but it's been 10 hours, and the questions just keep coming. I need a break.\u201d\n\nThe lowly, mighty, mysterious, depended-upon, despised tampon: common enough to be sold in drugstores and public restrooms all over America, integral enough to the female experience to merit its own memorable jeremiad in The Vagina Monologues (\u201ca wad of dry fucking cotton\u201d), and yet still taboo enough to be the central prop in one of the only Fifty Shades of Grey sex scenes deemed too risqu\u00e9 for the movie adaptation. The average American woman is estimated to use more than 16,000 tampons in her lifetime\u2014and yet, as that daylong AMA suggests, they remain surprisingly mystifying.\n\nBut every time a tampon user pops in a Playtex Sport or a Tampax Pearl, she\u2019s handling a disposable, absorbent totem of centuries of technological innovation and cultural influence. The commercial tampon as we know it has been shaped and re-shaped by a myriad of invisible forces\u2014like genuine concern for women\u2019s wellness, certainly, but also sexism, panic, feminism, capitalism, and secrecy.\n\nThere are differing accounts of the whens, wheres, and hows of the earliest tampon-like devices. Women in ancient Rome, it\u2019s been said, fashioned their own tampons out of wool; Indonesian women are believed to have used vegetable fibers to staunch menstrual flow, while rolls of grass are said to have been used in parts of Africa. According to Nancy Friedman\u2019s 1981 book Everything You Must Know About Tampons, Hawaiian women undertook the (presumably itchy) endeavor of using \u201cthe furry part of a native fern,\u201d and ancient Japanese women,according to Qualifying Times: Points of Change in U.S. Women's Sportauthor Jaime Schultz, made tampons from paper, secured them with bandages, and changed these dressings between 10 and 12 times every day.\n\nSome of the earliest tampons recognizable as we know them today\u2014intra-vaginal devices made from a string and a wad of something absorbent\u2014were documented in Europe in the 18th and 19th century. Curiously, these were more often used for purposes other than menstrual management. In some places, tampons were used as contraceptives, and Schultz cites a 1776 report from a French doctor that describes a tampon made from tightly rolled, vinegar-soaked linen that was used to stem the flow of hemorrhage and leucorrhea (non-menstrual vaginal discharge).\n\nIn the late 19th century, the accomplished U.S. gynecologist Paul F. Munde\u2019s 552-page oeuvre \u201cMinor surgical gynecology: a treatise of uterine diagnosis\u201d described eight distinct uses for the vaginal tampon, the first of which was as \u201ca carrier for the application of medicinal agents to the cervix and vagina.\u201d Only on item eight\u2014after uses like retaining the shape of the cervix to prevent a relapse of a prolapsed ovary\u2014was the absorption of \u201cvaginal and uterine discharges\u201d even mentioned, and nowhere in his section on tampons is menstruation mentioned specifically.\n\nIn 1879, around the same time commercial menstrual pads were arriving in Western markets for the first time, the British Medical Journal published a reporton \u201cDr. Aveling\u2019s Vaginal Tampon-Tube\u201d in its section on the latest innovations in medicine. It described an applicator contraption that today seems alarmingly complex, complete with a \u201csmall unsilvered glass vaginal speculum, with a wooden rod.\u201d\n\nThe \u201ckite-tail\u201d tampon that went inside the applicator was made \u201cby tying three or four pledges of cotton-wool in a row with a piece of fine string or stout thread,\u201d which were then saturated with glycerine (!) and smushed into the beveled end of the speculum, using the wooden rod. Then:\n\nThis is then to be gently inserted into the vagina, until it reaches the neck of the womb, when the tube may be withdrawn over the rod which is retained to hold the tampon in its place. Lastly, the rod is withdrawn.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear whether the tampon-tube was primarily intended for use by doctors (or midwives), or by women themselves: TheBMJ took care to note that \u201cin cases of erosion or congestion, this little operation can generally be managed by the patient,\u201d but \u201cin cases of uterine displacement, further adjustment by the medical man will be necessary.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s not much known about whether women of this era bought products like Dr. Aveling\u2019s Tampon-Tube for at-home use, or whether they used them for managing their periods. But around the turn of the century, it seems tampons were still\u2014in medical circles, at least\u2014best known as devices for treatment or non-menstrual absorption within the vagina. A 1900 entry in the British edition of the Nurse's Dictionary of Medical Terms and Nursing Treatment Compiled for the Use of Nurses, unearthed by the Museum of Menstruation website, defined \u201ctampons\u201d as:\n\nplugs of antiseptic wool enclosed in gauze, and used for introducing into the vagina, &c. Sometimes a capsule containing carbolic, thymol, &c., is enclosed in the middle of the tampon, and is broken just before use, so that the antiseptic permeates the whole plug. A string is usually attached to the plug to aid in its withdrawal.\n\n\u201cTampons can be bought,\u201d the entry continued, \u201cbut in hospitals are generally made by the nurses.\"\n\nOf course, that was about to change.\n\nLegend has it, Schultz writes in Qualifying Times, that in the early 1920s, a Kimberly-Clark employee named John Williamson poked some holes in a condom, stuffed it with the fluffy, absorbent filling used in commercial Kotex pads, and pitched it to his dad, a Kimberly-Clark medical consultant, as a menstrual solution.\n\n\u201cNever would I put any such strange article inside a woman!\u201d the elder Williamson is said to have exclaimed, thus swiftly shooting down what might have been the origin story of the modern commercial menstrual tampon.\n\nBut the tampon would get its creation myth nonetheless, though about a decade later. As Tampax tells it, a Colorado-based general practitioner named Earle Cleveland Haas introduced the first commercial applicator tampon. A friend of Haas\u2019s mentioned to him that she had taken to wearing a piece of sponge intra-vaginally to absorb menstrual flow.\n\nThinking of his wife (by some accounts a ballerina) and her struggles with the bulky menstrual pads of that era, Haas developed a variation made of compressed cotton. And because Haas wanted to ensure that the tampon could be inserted and removed without having to be touched directly, he designed an applicator from telescoping paper tubes.\n\nHaas obtained a patent in 1933, and combining the terms \u201ctampon\u201d and \u201cvaginal packs,\u201d he called his product Tampax.\n\nTampax arrived on shelves in the mid-1930s\u2014and was one of the great game-changers in 20th-century periods. \u201cFor many people, there was a lot of discomfort with the idea of women touching themselves in any way in their vaginal or labia area, especially young girls,\u201d says Sharra Vostral, the author of Under Wraps: A History of Menstrual Hygiene Technology.\n\n\u201cA lot of people argued that [tampon use] was not only inappropriate because it might break the hymen, but it might be also pleasurable and might be a way for girls to experience orgasmic pleasure.\u201d Tampax\u2019s telescoping applicator made it possible to insert a tampon without the dreaded self-touching\u2014though it didn\u2019t do much to assuage fears of accidental virginity loss, which, despite evidence that the hymen doesn\u2019t necessarily break as a result of sex or tampon use, still persist in some parts of the world today.\n\nEspecially in the United States, the spike in women\u2019s physical activity during World War II made tampons a staple of the American menstrual period. Tampax, available for 35 cents and often delivered by mail, came in discreet, plain paper-wrapped boxes of 10, and it had imitators within a year of its debut.\n\nThe Tampax model didn\u2019t immediately eclipse other tampon designs. In 1942, Schultz writes, a survey found that 37 percent of tampon users still used homemade remedies, like strips of doctor\u2019s-office cotton or cut-up store-bought sponges. Frequently, these DIY solutions were employed by women with active lifestyles (like dancers) and, as Friedman points out, women in \u201cdubious professions\u201d of the era like acting, modeling, prostitution\u2014and sports.\n\nBut in 1945, the magazine Consumer Reportsnoted that while tampons still were only a fraction as popular as pads, \u201cthere can be no question about [the tampon\u2019s] rapid growth, as more women take advantage of the greater comfort of internally worn protection.\u201d Indeed, sales of tampons had increased by five times from 1937 to 1943. One survey taken in 1940 and 1944 found approximately one-quarter of women regularly used them.\n\nShortly after, in 1945, The Journal of the American Medical Association publishedits first substantial research on tampons. Some of the newly popular applicator tampons were made of absorbent cotton, explained the study author Robert L. Dickinson, while one was made from cotton lint ers, and one was crepe paper held together with a net of threads. All had a strand of waterproof string and \u201ca light inserter for placement at any depth by means of a cardboard tube.\u201d In Germany, around the same time, the gynecologist Judith Esser-Mittag was developing a digital (that is to say, non-applicator) tampon that would come to be called the O.B. tampon\u2014and it would go on to enjoy massive popularity in many parts of the world.\n\nEven as scientific research on tampons began in earnest, Friedman explains that \u201cmedical opinion was divided on tampons, with \u2018forward-thinking\u2019 physicians recommending them wholeheartedly while more conservative doctors waxed eloquent in condemning them.\u201d\n\nDickinson also found that tampon usage was most common among young, educated women; \u201cthe higher the income bracket the greater being the employment of the tampon,\u201d he wrote. (It\u2019s been noted, however, that Dickinson also wrote training materials for Tampax. Much of the existing research on tampon safety was sponsored and published by feminine-hygiene product manufacturers themselves\u2014a notable asterisk on the medical information on tampons from that era.)\n\nIn the years following, companies continued to tweak their products in hopes of further simplifying the modern menstrual period. New innovations like Kotex\u2019s Kotams Stick\u2014a hybrid between a digital and applicator tampon that looked something like a tampon on the end of a lollipop stick\u2014emerged in the 1960s, and 1970 brought the advent of a tampon with two withdrawal strings.\n\nMany of the new products seemed to emphasize the secrecy they could offer a woman on her period. For example, popular brands of tampons in the 1940s had included Lillettes, Meds, Pursettes, and digital Kotex tampons called Fibs; as Schultz points out, \u201cThe names are telling in that they emphasize that the products are feminine and diminutive, of medical origins, or allow women a \u2018little white lie\u2019 that conceals menstruation.\u201d Dickinson noted in the 1945 JAMAstudy that yet another method of period concealment had started to show up on store shelves: tampons with fragrances. Playtex later adopted that same strategy, marketing \u201cdeodorant\u201d tampons with what was advertised as a \u201cfresh, delicate scent\u201d starting in 1971.\n\nTo some women, the notion of \u201cdeodorant\u201d tampons seemed too far a stretch. Friedman wrote that some women developed allergic reactions to the fragrances\u2014and besides, as she pointed out, \u201cMenstrual fluid has no odor until it\u2019s exposed to air, which doesn\u2019t happen with any tampon until it\u2019s removed.\u201d\n\nAlternative products\u2014like the Tassaway, a disposable menstrual cup introduced in 1970\u2014entered the market, and as the University of Massachusetts Boston professor Chris Bobel noted in an article for Health Care for Women International, a small feminist movement had begun to publicly question why women should feel pressured to hide or staunch their menstruation in the first place. What was so shocking or gross or shameful, after all, about something that happened to half the world\u2019s adult population every month?\n\nStill, tampons continued to flourish\u2014even the deodorant ones, despite growing allergy-related concerns from physicians. And by the time Playtex introduced the plastic, dome-tipped applicator in 1973, the tampon was a common technology\u2014according to Vostral, it was included in more than 70 percent of U.S. women\u2019s hygiene routines.\n\nBut the momentum was about to carry the tampon industry too far. In 1975, Procter & Gamble began test marketing its first feminine-hygiene product\u2014a distinctive, futuristic new tampon called Rely. Rely was shaped like a tea bag, engineered to expand both widthwise and lengthwise, and made of entirely synthetic materials. One of these was carboxymethylcellulose, or CMC\u2014an edible, hydrophilic ingredient used in manufactured products from ice cream to detergent. Chips of CMC inside the tampon made it hyper-absorbent; some women, it\u2019s been said, could wear it for an entire period.\n\nIt\u2019s startling, in hindsight, that Rely made it into consumers\u2019 hands, let alone their vaginas. Perhaps U.S. manufacturers should have sensed something was amiss when regulators in Japan forbade the import and sale of Rely tampons because of its chemical composition, as Vostral and the New York University microbiologist Philip Tierno note.\n\nAnd in 1976, new legislation in Congressimposed stricter regulations on American-made tampons by switching their categorization under the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act from cosmetics to medical devices. But because Rely had been testing a small sample of products before the law changed, the Rely tampon escaped what Vostral describes as \u201ca whole new battery of tests\u201d before arriving in stores.\n\n(Ironically, as Friedman notes, the year after tampons were reclassified from the \u201ccosmetics\u201d category of FDA regulation to \u201cmedical devices,\u201d new legislationbegan requiring cosmetics manufacturers to list ingredients on their packaging\u2014but not medical devices. To this day, a tube of mascara or a bottle of shampoo has to come with a list of ingredients, but not a box of tampons.)\n\nSo Rely made it to the markets\u2014and initially, it was a sensation. \u201cRely was pretty fantastic, actually,\u201d Vostral says. \u201cSome women, especially if they had heavy periods, thought it was a great product.\u201d\n\nShe adds, though, that the Rely tampon could absorb so much fluid that it looked \u201ckind of mushroom-like\u201d when it was removed after use. Some women\u2014particularly young women who had never given birth\u2014found Rely tampons to be painful to remove \u201cbecause they would absorb so much that they would stick to the vaginal walls.\u201d\n\nIn 1978, faint alarm bells began to sound. The Berkeley Women\u2019s Health Collective accused manufacturers of withholding information about the substances used in tampons even after repeated requests for a list of ingredients. Circulating their grievances via pamphlet, the collective also blamed manufacturers for ignoring the risks of shredded fibers being left behind inside the body and over-drying of the vagina.\n\nNevertheless, Tierno estimates that by 1980, nearly a quarter of tampon users were using Rely. Competitors had rapidly introduced their own hyper-absorbent, synthetic tampons; by mid-1980, Tierno says, \u201cthere was not one tampon manufacturer on the market with a product that did not contain [synthetic ingredients],\u201d and Friedman points out that almost every tampon for sale at the time contained some sort of \u201cmodified superabsorbent cellulose.\u201d\n\nThen, between October of 1979 and May of 1980, 55 cases of toxic-shock syndrome were reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2014seven of them fatal. TSS, a rare staphylococcal illness characterized by vomiting, diarrhea, fever, and rashes, had been identified just two years earlier after a minor outbreak in Denver, Colorado. When young, menstruating women began exhibiting some of the same symptoms as the Denver patients, many people began to suspect a link between tampon use and TSS.\n\nIn July of 1980, CDC investigators issued a reportlinking tampons to TSS. That September, its study of TSS cases in Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Iowa found that the absorbency of the tampon and the use of Rely tampons specifically \u201cwere the only variables that significantly increased the relative risk of TSS.\u201d Tierno adds that three-quarters of the women who reported tampon-related TSS were found to be using Rely tampons specifically. P&G, after a tense standoff with the Food and Drug Administration, withdrew Rely from shelves just weeks after the CDC\u2019s September report.\n\nIn 1980, a total of 812 menstruation-related TSS cases were reported\u201438 fatal. Every major manufacturer of tampons at the time faced lawsuits. But P&G facedmore than a thousand.\n\nIn 1982, the family of Patricia Kehm, a 25-year-old who had died of TSS while using Rely, successfully sued P&G for $300,000 in nonpunitive damages. \u201cPat Kehm died because Procter & Gamble let her die,\u201d the plaintiff\u2019s attorney, Tom Riley, said in his final remarks. \u201cThey were more concerned about their product than warning their customers.\u201d (Proctor & Gamble did not respond to requests for comment.)\n\nBy June of 1983, more than 2,200 total cases of TSS had been reported to the CDC. More than 80 percent were menstruating women using tampons.\n\nIt took years after the outbreak for scientists to figure out how tampons caused TSS. In 1989, Tierno, along with Bruce Hanna, published research that found a link between synthetic materials\u2014specifically CMC, polyester, polyacrylate rayon, and viscose rayon\u2014and toxic-shock syndrome. The synthetic ingredients, they wrote, provided a fertile environment for the amplification of the toxigenic bacterium Staphylococcus aureus, causing disease.\n\nIn other words, Rely and other tampons made with synthetics were \u201ckind of like a petri dish,\u201d Vostral explains. \u201cWhen a woman would change Rely, it would squeeze some of the bacteria into the vagina, then you\u2019d put in another tampon and it just provided a whole new set of food.\u201d\n\nFortunately, only a small portion of women have TSST-1, the particular strain ofStaphylococcus aureus that causes toxic shock, in their vaginas\u2014a 2005 Journal of Clinical Microbiology study of North American women between 13 and 40 found 1 percent of its subjects carried TSST-1 vaginally.\n\n\u201cFifteen to 20 percent of women can carry staph aureus\u2014maybe even 25 percent carry staph aureus, and that\u2019s not necessarily toxigenic,\u201d Tierno explains. Less than three percent ofstaph aureus strains are toxigenic with TSST-1. (Younger women who carry this particular bacteria in their vaginal cavities are more susceptible to TSS because their immune systems aren\u2019t as developed, which is why many cases of tampon-related TSS occur among teenagers and young women.)\n\nAs Karen Houppert noted in a 1995 Village Voice expos\u00e9 on the feminine-hygiene industry, once scientists discovered that the bacteria necessary to cause TSS lived in only a small percentage of women\u2019s bodies (and was usually dormant), the scare seemed to be over\u2014so, according to Houppert, \u201cthe FDA relaxed.\u201d The government \u201cleft further research on causes and effects of toxic shock syndrome to tampon manufacturers,\u201d she wrote, \u201cand the industry continued to escape any serious regulation.\u201d\n\nIn 1983, tampons went to space. When Sally Ride became the first American woman in space, NASA engineers asked her whether 100 tampons would be enough for her weeklong journey on the space shuttle Challenger\u2014arguably helping cement the tampon\u2019s reputation as both a fixture of modern womanhood and a complete mystery to men. (The first tampons in space, The American Prospect notes, \u201cwere packed with their strings connecting them, like a strip of sausages, so they wouldn\u2019t float away.\u201d) Perhaps this feat contributed to a 1986Consumer Reports article naming the tampon, despite its recent, gruesome spate of bad publicity, one of the \u201c50 small wonders and big deals that revolutionized the lives of consumers\u201d\u2014right alongside air conditioning and running shoes.\n\nBack on Earth, meanwhile, tampons were evolving: Toxic-shock warning labels were added to tampon boxes to recommend using the minimum absorbency needed, and in late 1989, after a decade-long campaign effort (in which advocacy and feminist health groups like Public Citizen and Women\u2019s Health International were instrumental), the FDA ordered tampon manufacturers to implement a standardized system of \u201cjunior,\u201d \u201cregular,\u201d \u201csuper,\u201d and \u201csuper-plus\u201d absorbency ratings, on a scale from six to 15 grams\u2019 absorbency.\n\n(At the height of the TSS scare, more than 40 percent of women were using tamponswith absorbencies of 15.4 grams or more.) To this end, the FDA implemented a fascinating contraption called a \u201csyngyna,\u201d which simulated all the physical conditions of tampon use, as the industry\u2019s standard method of testing tampon absorbency.\n\nBut the most dramatic changes to the post-TSS tampon were virtually invisible to consumers.\n\nTierno recalls writing a letter in 1980 to the CDC, the FDA, and P&G identifying four popular tampon ingredients that could amplify bacteria growth: carboxymethylcellulose, polyester, polyacrylate rayon, and viscose rayon. At the time, \u201cof course, I was laughed at,\u201d he says\u2014and Tierno\u2019s research, it\u2019s worth noting, has remained controversial, especially among tampon manufacturers and scientists they sponsor. But according to Tierno (and the CDC), manufacturers abandoned the use of CMC and polyester after Rely was pulled from shelves, and tampons containing polyacrylates were withdrawn from markets in 1985.\n\n(Tampax, Friedman notes, even revived a line of all-cotton tampons it had discontinued in 1978.) Viscose rayon is still commonly used in tampons; a representative for Kotex confirmed to me that viscose rayon is the only one of these ingredients still in use in its products. (Representatives for Procter & Gamble, now the owner of Tampax, did not respond to requests for comment on their ingredients, and Playtex declined to comment on theirs.)\n\nAfter Rely, consumers began to realize just how little they knew about what was actually in tampons. In 1981, Friedman\u2019s book pointed out that, at the time of publication, only Playtex listed its basic ingredients in its packaging, and it didn\u2019t specify whether fibers had been bleached or chemically modified to enhance absorbency. Several groups, like the Boston Women\u2019s Health Book Collective (the publishers of Our Bodies, Ourselves) and Women\u2019s Health International pushed for manufacturers to reveal full lists of tampons\u2019 ingredients. None of these groups were successful.\n\nThe CDC has stopped actively tracking the TSS epidemic, but a report from 1996 shows a dramatic decrease in reported menstrual cases of TSS after the mid-1980s. In fact, according to the CDC, no U.S. women died of tampon-related TSS at all in 1988 or 1989. Still, between 1987 and 1996, 636 cases of menstrual TSS were reported, 51 of them fatal.\n\nIn 1997, Procter & Gamble acquired Tampax\u2019s parent company, Tambrands\u2014and its feminine-hygiene division promptly got to work on designing a new and improved tampon. Jim Keighley, a section head of engineering at P&G at the time, remembers that the new product was to have a \u201cpremium applicator\u201d (that is, a plastic applicator), so that P&G\u2019s newly acquired Tampax brand could move away from the \u201ctampon my mother uses\u201d reputation its cardboard applicator was earning it. And, importantly, the product that would come to be called Tampax Pearl was to have nothing in common with the ill-fated Rely experiment.\n\n\u201cWe were very intentional about completely starting over,\u201d recalls Keighley, who worked in the Tampax division of P&G until 2007. \u201cWe did not want Pearl to be Rely II.\u201d\n\nAnd with good reason. Research by the Association of Schools of Public Health indicates that by 1990, information about TSS had caused \u201ca significant decrease in use of tampons in all racial-ethnic groups.\u201d In the ASPH\u2019s survey of current or past tampon users, more than 40 percent reported that their use of tampons had decreased after learning about TSS\u2014and in a larger survey, just over half of the women reported using pads exclusively.\n\nBut throughout the industry, the new urgency of developing a better tampon\u2014and, undoubtedly, the heightened scrutiny\u2014resulted in a number of breakthrough discoveries. Among them: While the tampon had been cylindrical for more than a century, the human vagina is not.\n\nDevelopers at Tampax studied wax molds of real women\u2019s vaginal cavities (\u201cI was never really quite clear on how they did that,\u201d Keighley remembers, \u201cbut they did get some people to agree to do it\u201d) and had what he describes as an \u201ca-ha!\u201d moment.\n\n\u201cIntuitively, we all think that cavity is round,\u201d he explains. And it is\u2014but only at the vaginal opening. The cavity widens and flattens the farther up you go\u2014it\u2019s \u201cmore the shape of a mummy sleeping bag,\u201d Keighley explains, \u201cand that\u2019s because of the weight of the internal organs around it.\u201d Users of applicator tampons, P&G\u2019s team found, tended to insert tampons deeper into the cavity than users of digital tampons.\n\nRadical re-engineering ensued. Today, while digital tampons like O.B. are cylindrical when they expand, some applicator tampons expand into blossom or upside-down umbrella shapes, while others, like Tampax, expand into shapes reminiscent of stingrays or kites.\n\nKeighley\u2019s team at Tampax also tried a number of methods to improve the withdrawal cord of tampons. At first, \u201cWe could come up with stuff that worked, but we couldn\u2019t come up with stuff that looked good,\u201d he admits. Finally, though, Tampax settled on the Pearl\u2019s vaunted leakguard braid\u2014made of a yarn-like substance to enhance its wicking ability and sewn into the tampon for maximum security and comfort upon removal.\n\nTampax Pearl was a hit when it went on sale in 2001\u2014especially with young women. \u201cMy sons were teenagers back then,\u201d Keighley remembers. \u201cThey would bring girlfriends home to the house, and if they found out I made Pearl, they would say, \u2018Oh, I love Pearl!\u2019 My sons would just go nuts.\u201d\n\nOf course, not everybody fell back in love with tampons. A feminist backlash against tampons had a moment in the late 1990s, as Houppert\u2019s widely readVillage Voice expos\u00e9 and subsequent book The Curse\u2014Confronting the Last Unmentionable Taboo: Menstruation called out the industry for selling tampons containing dioxin, a \u201clikely carcinogen\u201d found in bleached rayon, and a 2006 article by Bobel in the research journal Sex Roles describes a group of young activists called the Student Environmental Action Coalition starting a \u201cDioxin Out of Tampons\u201d campaign in 1999. In 2000, James Madison University hosted the first Anti-Tampon conference.\n\nIn the late 1990s, major commercial tampon brands switched from dioxin-producing chlorine gas bleaching methods to either elemental \u201cchlorine-free\u201d or \u201ctotally chlorine free\u201d bleaching processes\u2014which, it\u2019s worth noting, don\u2019t necessarily eliminate dioxin so much as diminish its presence to trace levels. (Even trace levels of dioxin remain controversial; the FDA recommends that manufacturers list any possible chemical residue on their labeling, but says trace amounts of dioxin shouldn\u2019t be considered a hazard, while biologists like Tiernonote that the vagina's lining is super-permeable to chemicals and that small exposures to toxins can accumulate over time.)\n\nToday, Tierno estimates that 80 percent of U.S. women of menstruating age use tampons. But as Keighley notes, it\u2019s a mistake to assume consumer habits are the same everywhere. For example: Outside North America, digital tampons have outsold applicator tampons for decades. \u201cIf you interview women in Europe and ask why they like digital tampons, they\u2019ll tell you about [environmental] concerns. They\u2019ll also tell you that it\u2019s a hygienic concern\u2014that they don\u2019t trust the applicator being inserted inside their bodies,\u201d Keighley says. Conversely, tampon users in the U.S., who largely prefer applicators, \u201cwill tell you it\u2019s a hygienic thing\u2014they don\u2019t want to gunk up their fingers,\u201d he explains. \u201cConsumers develop very strong opinions on usage habits\u2014polar opposites, for the same reason.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s been a weird century thus far for commercial tampons. Few products in modern history have been quite as scandal-ridden\u2014or as quietly so. But the future of tampons looks bright, if potentially a little bizarre.\n\nA few hours into Reddit\u2019s marathon \u201cI design tampons\u201d AMA in 2011, Redditors began asking what the next generation of tampons might look like. Multilobal fibers were being experimented with, the host disclosed (for \u201cincreased capillary action,\u201d or better distribution of fluid throughout the tampon). Biodegradable tampons were \u201chard mainly because the materials tend to be expensive and fragile,\u201d but: \u201cI'm sure that Playtex, Tampay [sic], and Kotex are all probably working on it, though.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow about a Bluetooth-enabled buzzer for when your phone is on silent?\u201d one user joked. \u201cAh, who am I trying to kid. How about a built-in vibrator?\u201d\n\n\u201cAlready patented,\u201d karnim responded, \u201cthough I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s being produced.\u201d\n\nIndeed, in the last five years, the U.S. Patent Office has fielded patent proposals for new innovations including\u2014but not limited to\u2014a tampon with a saturation indicator, a reusable tampon applicator, a beveled tampon shaped sort of like a spool of thread to help stop leaks, and, yes, a vibrating tampon.\n\nAnd if activists and legislators have a say, the tampon of tomorrow could have a less murky relationship with human consumers. Though manufacturers like Tampax, Playtex, and Kotex now list their tampons\u2019 basic ingredients on their packaging voluntarily, many still urge manufacturers to list more complete inventories of the chemical substances and processes used. Earlier this year, Representative Carolyn Maloney of New York reintroduced a bill to Congress calling for more research on feminine-hygiene-product safety.\n\nNamed for Robin Danielson, a woman who died of TSS in 1998, the bill calls for the FDA to investigate whether \u201cdioxins, synthetic fibers, chlorine, and other components (including contaminants and substances used as fragrances, colorants, dyes, and preservatives)\u201d pose health risks to sanitary-product users or their biological children. It also calls for the FDA to require independent testing to verify the data tampon and other sanitary-product manufacturers provide.\n\nThe Robin Danielson Act, originally known as the Tampon Safety and Research Act aims to create more transparency between manufacturers and consumers. It was first introduced to Congress in 1997.\n\n\u201cI will tell you,\u201d maintains Tierno, who advised Maloney in drafting early versions of the bill, \u201cif Congress\u2019 men had [vaginas], they would have passed this act the first time around.\u201d\n\nAlas: This latest go-round marks the 10th time such a bill will have been considered in Congress. The government-transparency website GovTrack gives the Robin Danielson Act a 2 percent chance of being enacted.\n\nRead the original article on The Atlantic.
