If anyone can make it through this, she can.

If you are having a bad day you can always go to her and she always make it better. She's just a sweet heart. I'm giving back to her, for all the bad days that I had, a little blood goes a long way,\" said Traci McKelvey, Julie's coworker.\n\n\"More and more, everyday, we find out how much she's impacted. All the students' lives she's touched over the school years. It's been amazing,\" said Landsverk.\n\nIf you weren't able to make Monday's blood drive you can still donate in Julie's honor all week at the Wichita Blood Donation Center.\n\nFriends are hosting another fundraiser for Julie.\n\nIt's a Walk/Run - Making Strides Against Gun Violence.\n\nSeptember 27th 1:00 PM beginning at the Derby Recreation Center, 801 East Market, Derby KS.
