Asking a Republican partisan to deny it is like asking a Christian to deny that Jesus is the Son of God. Such is the primacy of the unconstitutionality of Obamacare in the Republican faith.\n\nYet, in a 2013 interview unearthed by CNN\u2019s Chris Moody on Thursday, former tech executive and GOP presidential candidate Carly Fiorina breaks with her party on this most basic issue of political faith. Worse, when asked to comment on the 2013 video, a Fiorina campaign spokesperson repeats the heresy \u2014 Carly Fiorina supports an individual mandate, the original sin at the heart of Obamacare.\n\nNFIB v. Sebelius, the first Supreme Court case seeking to take down the Affordable Care Act, was built upon two principles \u2014 that the individual mandate is unconstitutional and that the mandate is such an essential keystone supporting the entire law that the whole thing must be repealed if this one piece falls. Nearly the entire Republican establishment lined up behind these legal arguments. Republican-led states were plaintiffs in the litigation. Speaker John Boehner filed a brief supporting this attack on Obamacare. So did 43 Republican members of the Senate.\n\nAnd, while the GOP ultimately did not prevail in NFIB \u2014 though they did receive a consolation prize that allowed Republican officials to block the law\u2019s Medicaid expansion in many states \u2014 that case was still a catalyzing event in the development of Republican legal theory. From the Nixon administration through the moment Republican lawyers began talking about a legal challenge to Obamacare, GOP legal rhetoric had largely focused on the virtues of judicial restraint. After Obamacare, Republicans have grown increasingly eager to use the judiciary to mow down laws they do not like. Otherwise reliably conservative judges (and justices) who vote to uphold the Affordable Care Act have increasingly become pariahs in GOP circles.\n\nThe notion the individual mandate\u2019s unconstitutionality is so central to the Republican faith, in other words, that the GOP literally rebuilt its entire theory of the proper role of the judiciary to accommodate the view that Obamacare is unconstitutional.\n\nAdmittedly, Fiorina\u2019s support for an individual mandate is somewhat qualified. According to her campaign spokeperson, she does not support the package of reforms contained in the Affordable Care Act, and instead supports a weaker version of health reform originally proposed by the conservative Heritage Foundation in 1989. As CNN characterizes her campaign\u2019s explanation, \u201cFiorina\u2019s support for an individual mandate . . . differs from Obamacare in that the law\u2019s mandate demands that every American be covered with plans that include a higher threshold of services.\u201d\n\nThis is a meaningful policy distinction \u2014 the Heritage proposal was quite different from the Affordable Care Act, and it included a number of conservative fantasies such as voucherizing Medicare and slashing Medicaid. It is not, however, a meaningful constitutional distinction. As the four dissenting justices who sought to repeal the entire Affordable Care Act wrote in NFIB, \u201cthe Act before us here exceeds federal power\u201d because it \u201cmandat[es] the purchase of health insurance.\u201d The fact that Fiorina would make her mandate smaller is irrelevant; any individual mandate is heresy under this reading of the Constitution.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "The notion the individual mandate's unconstitutionality is so central to the Republican faith that the GOP literally rebuilt its entire theory of the proper role of the judiciary to accommodate the view that Obamacare is unconstitutional.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "The notion the individual mandate's unconstitutionality is so central to the Republican faith that the GOP literally rebuilt its entire theory of the proper role of the judiciary to accommodate the view that Obamacare is unconstitutional.", "title": "Carly Fiorina Betrays The Central Unifying Principle Of Republican Constitutional Theory", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/justice/2015/09/24/3705276/carly-fiorina-betrays-the-central-unifying-principle-of-republican-constitutional-theory/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/12170719/Carly.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The notion the individual mandate's unconstitutionality is so central to the Republican faith that the GOP literally rebuilt its entire theory of the proper role of the judiciary to accommodate the view that Obamacare is unconstitutional.", "creator": "@imillhiser", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/12170719/Carly-321x214.jpg", "title": "Carly Fiorina Betrays The Central Unifying Principle Of Republican Constitutional Theory", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-justice", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/12170719/Carly.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/12170719/Carly.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2015-09-24T15:45:14+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/IanMillhiserPublic"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf535\"", "article_summary": "Justice Carly Fiorina Betrays The Central Unifying Principle Of Republican Constitutional Theory CREDIT: AP Photo/Manuel Balce CenetaObamacare is unconstitutional.\nOtherwise reliably conservative judges (and justices) who vote to uphold the Affordable Care Act have increasingly become pariahs in GOP circles.\nWorse, when asked to comment on the 2013 video, a Fiorina campaign spokesperson repeats the heresy \u2014 Carly Fiorina supports an individual mandate, the original sin at the heart of Obamacare.\nAs CNN characterizes her campaign\u2019s explanation, \u201cFiorina\u2019s support for an individual mandate .\nFrom the Nixon administration through the moment Republican lawyers began talking about a legal challenge to Obamacare, GOP legal rhetoric had largely focused on the virtues of judicial restraint."}
