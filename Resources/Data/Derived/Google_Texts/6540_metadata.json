Flights were canceled, schools closed, Mardi Gras parades were rescheduled, and at least two state legislatures, in Kentucky and Tennessee, announced they would not meet on Tuesday as the storm continued into North Carolina.\n\nThe National Weather Service forecast was for up to a foot of snow for some areas, with more in eastern Kentucky, followed by days of temperatures that would be 20 to 30 degrees below the norm. The cold was expected to complicate recovery efforts and render some preparations, like salting roadways, less effective.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s bad, and it\u2019s only going to get worse before it gets better,\u201d said Buddy Rogers, a spokesman for the Department of Emergency Management in Kentucky. Plows there could barely keep up with the quickly falling snow, which began well before dawn in the western part of the state.\n\nThe storm fell on the Presidents\u2019 Day holiday, giving rise to a chief-hailing nickname, #Snowbama, that was quickly adopted on Twitter. (Example: \u201cCoffee was already cold by the time I got to it. Thanks, #Snowbama.\u201d) A suggested replacement, #TeddySnowzavelt, fell flat.\n\nThe storm was following a track from eastern Kansas through Tennessee and West Virginia to the mid-Atlantic Coast. While most of the affected areas can expect a snowstorm about once a year, said Jim Hayes, a meteorologist at the weather service\u2019s Weather Prediction Center in Maryland, states like Kentucky were seeing snowfall well above average.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThis is going to be a big event for them,\u201d he said. \u201cThey don\u2019t get that much snowfall very often.\u201d\n\nWashington braced for the heaviest snowfall of the season, while the Capital Weather Gang blog at The Washington Post pointed out that if the storm jogged slightly to the south, it would be a bust. At Dulles International Airport, the temperature fell on Monday to a record low of 6 degrees.\n\nThe southern band of the system, from eastern Oklahoma through Little Rock, Ark., to Georgia, got more freezing rain than snow. Nashville was hardest hit by ice and freezing rain, the National Weather Service said on Monday evening. In Georgia, wary after an ice storm last year left thousands of people stranded for hours, the governor declared a state of emergency for 15 northern counties where rain, sleet and snow began falling Monday morning.\n\nNew Orleans pushed up the start time for two major parades on Monday afternoon, and braced for cold and blustery winds on Tuesday, Mardi Gras, just one year after a rainy Mardi Gras.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019ll be cold and windy, but at least it won\u2019t be raining,\u201d said Errol Laborde, the editor of New Orleans Magazine and a Mardi Gras historian.\n\nEmergency officials worried over the bitter cold that was forecast to follow the storm, saying it would keep schools closed longer and could lead to brownouts because of increased demand for power. \u201cThey\u2019re predicting lows from 10 to 13 degrees below zero Wednesday night,\u201d Mr. Rogers said in Kentucky. \u201cThe high Wednesday they\u2019re saying is going to be around 5 degrees. That\u2019s just going to complicate the snow removal on the secondary roads.\u201d\n\nWet, icy snow began falling in North Carolina between Durham and Chapel Hill shortly before 5 p.m. Monday. Gov. Pat McCrory declared a state of emergency ahead of the storm. Trucks from the State Department of Transportation raced to dump anti-freezing brine as evening fell.\n\nJoey Cass and Hunter Harrington had just made it up from Sanford, N.C., about 40 miles south, in a landscaping truck equipped with a snowplow to clear the parking lot of a shopping center on Martin Luther King Jr. Parkway.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cWe started getting the trucks ready about 6:30 this morning,\u201d said Mr. Harrington, 21. The parking lot was packed and lines long at the Harris Teeter market where Mr. Cass and Mr. Harrington were set to work.\n\nBut at Compare Foods, three miles down the road, shoppers were preparing for what they hoped would be the briefest of interruptions. Gladis Castro, 47, a hotel worker, loaded her cart at with extra coffee, sugar and pork, just in case she had to play host for her family for two or three days. \u201cOnly God knows what\u2019s going to come,\u201d she said in Spanish. \u201cI\u2019ve been here for 16 years, so I know it\u2019s not usually bad. But better to stay at home.\u201d\n\nFelicia Parker, 37, said she was not buying extra groceries. \u201cWe\u2019re not used to seeing a whole lot, so we\u2019re not expecting a whole lot,\u201d she said. If anything, she was happy to be able to start shopping early because the gas station where she works as a cook had closed early to allow employees to get home. In last year\u2019s snow, she said, \u201cpeople got stuck, it happened so fast.\u201d Still, she expected to be back at work on Tuesday.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime":
