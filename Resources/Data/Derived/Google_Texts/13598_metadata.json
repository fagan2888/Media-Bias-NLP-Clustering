Two days later, the freshman broke protocol with photos of his own. (Cliff Owen/AP)\n\nJust two days after being sworn in, Rep. Mike Bishop (R-Mich.) made his first freshman mistake \u2014 violating a House rule and then promptly getting called out publicly for it on Twitter.\n\nThe newbie was given the chance to preside over the House on Thursday, and in all the excitement he whipped out his iPhone to capture the memory. He then tweeted two shots of the empty House chamber, calling it the \u201ctemple of democracy.\u201d Photography on the chamber floor is a big no-no.\n\nBishop was informed of the rules on Twitter by NBC reporter Frank Thorp V. Bishop tweeted back, \u201cgot it, thanks,\u201d and deleted the photo tweets.\n\nBut the Sunlight Foundation\u2019s Politwoops database captures politicians\u2019 deleted tweets. So Bishop\u2019s mistake is preserved for all time. (Bishop has since blocked the guy who leads Politwoops.)\n\nBishop\u2019s spokeswoman, Kelli Ford, told the Loop that the congressman was just excited.\n\nSecurity agents examine damage to an SUV that was hit by the car behind it as a motorcade ferried John Kerry to an airport in India. (Rick Wilking/AFP/Getty Images)\n\n\u201cIn a moment of awe he made an honest mistake, and he won\u2019t do it again,\u201d she said.\n\nToo bad for Bishop he didn\u2019t take his photos in the hours last Tuesday when there weren\u2019t any rules on the House floor. At that time, before the new Congress voted on its own protocols, lawmakers were taking selfies and posing for photos, according to CQ Roll Call, which described the scene as \u201cthe wild, Wild West in terms of decorum.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s my Obamacare repeal!\n\nTo be the Republican who sponsors the bill that dismantles a key pillar of Obamacare is worth powerful bragging rights in some circles. So it\u2019s no wonder there would be a little competition to have that honor.\n\nA staffer for Rep. Renee Ellmers (R-N.C.) tried to lay claim, sending an e-mail Thursday night to an internal list of GOP staffers that she would be introducing a bill to repeal the health-care law\u2019s mandate that requires businesses with more than 50 full-time employees to offer health insurance. He hoped their bosses would sign on as co-sponsors.\n\nBut the next morning, GOP staffers received an e-mail from the office of Rep. Charles Boustany (R-La.), letting them know that, lest there be any confusion, he would be introducing the legislation to repeal the employer mandate, as he had the previous two Congresses.\n\n\u201cGiven that Congressman Boustany sits on [Ways and Means], which has jurisdiction over this issue, has been a long time champion of this issue, and has already built a coalition of interested stakeholders, we look forward to having your boss join as a cosponsor this Congress,\u201d the Boustany staffer wrote.\n\nThat\u2019s passive-aggressive Hill-speak for \u201cHands off my bill, Ellmers.\u201d\n\nEllmers has no intention of backing down, though. Her spokeswoman told the Loop that she could be introducing her bill as soon as this week. (The GOP-controlled House already jumped at the chance to start chipping away at the law last week.) Her staff has been in communication with Boustany\u2019s to figure out how to add components to her bill that would \u201cdistinguish it from his.\u201d\n\nNow, now, guys. There will be plenty of opportunities to take your shot at hatcheting Obamacare. Of course, if successful, the White House would promptly veto.\n\nBut it\u2019s the thought that counts.\n\nRain checks for Kissinger\n\nTuesday was supposed to be a big day on Capitol Hill for former secretary of state Henry Kissinger. He was scheduled to be the opening witness to testify at the inaugural hearings of the GOP-run Senate Foreign Relations Committee and Senate Armed Services Committee.\n\nForeign Relations Chairman Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) had scheduled Kissinger for a talk titled \u201cThe National Interest: Articulating the Case for American Leadership in the World.\u201d\n\nArmed Services Chairman John McCain (R-Ariz.) had him teed up Tuesday afternoon \u201cto provide a perspective on global challenges to national security.\u201d\n\nBut it was not to be.\n\nA notice from Corker\u2019s office Monday morning said that, \u201cDue to a fractured shoulder\u201d the 91-year-old Kissinger \u201chad to postpone his appearance before the committee.\u201d\n\nA spokesman for the Senate Armed Services Committee said that there will be a hearing Tuesday afternoon and that the panel was working on a revised agenda given Kissinger\u2019s injured-reserve status.\n\nKissinger\u2019s office told us that the nonagenarian broke his shoulder on Dec. 28 and that he had been hospitalized for five days. His appearances may be rescheduled for the end of January, we were told.\n\nKissinger declined to talk about how he had injured himself, his office said.\n\nMaybe it was a bear hug from good pal and Dallas Cowboys fan Chris Christie? That, after all, was the Sunday when Dallas creamed Washington.\n\nHoodies vs. the whip\n\nRep. Steve Scalise (R-La.) may have kept the support of his Republican colleagues after news surfaced that he gave a 2002 speech to a white-supremacist group, but others are not so eager to let it go.\n\nSo when Scalise greets donors at the Capitol Hill Club on Tuesday afternoon, he\u2019ll also be met with protests.\n\nThe Million Hoodies Movement for Justice, a movement created after the death of Florida teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012, has organized a protest to gather outside the GOP meeting spot where Scalise will hold an event to introduce supporters to his congressional team.\n\nThe group\u2019s Facebook invite is titled \u201cIs This Your GOP? Are You Willing to Confront Racism in Your Own Party?\u201d It asks that people gather at the Capitol Hill Club at 3 p.m. to \u201cdemand accountability for [Scalise\u2019s] actions, and removal from his leadership role.\u201d\n\nDespite the pile-on from Democrats, including the White House, House Republicans are keeping Scalise on as majority whip. And while some have called for his resignation or removal, other civil rights groups and black leaders are instead pressing for a meeting with him to ask more questions.\n\nWade Henderson, president of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, wrote Sunday that Scalise had not yet responded.\n\nDiplomacy and dents\n\nMany things can go awry during travel abroad, even if you\u2019re the secretary of state.\n\nJohn Kerry\u2019s motorcade was heading to the airport in Ahmedabad, India, on Monday after an international investor conference when his Toyota SUV was hit by the car behind him.\n\nThe accident was caused, we hear, by a driver farther up in the motorcade braking suddenly for a puppy on the road. The rear door to Kerry\u2019s vehicle was crushed in what was described by a State Department official as \u201ca minor traffic accident resulting in some damage to both cars.\u201d\n\nKerry \u201csustained no injuries, nor did any staff or personnel,\u201d the official said. \u201cOne vehicle was switched out, and the motorcade proceeded to the airport without further incident.\u201d\n\nThe secretary of state\u2019s SUV may well have been armed, which could explain why it sustained only minor damage. The car that hit Kerry\u2019s appears to have been involved in more than a fender bender. That\u2019s why it was \u201cswitched out.\u201d\n\n\u2014 With Colby Itkowitz\n\nTwitter: @KamenInTheLoop, @ColbyItkowitz", "article_metadata": {"description": "The freshman lawmaker took photos of the House chamber, which is against the rules.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/colby.itkowitz", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "The freshman lawmaker took photos of the House chamber, which is against the rules.", "title": "Rep.
