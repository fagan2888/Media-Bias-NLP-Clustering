The Longmont employees affected in the layoffs work in the design center, which is one of two nationwide. The other is in Minnesota.\n\nSeagate might be most familiar to consumers for its computer hard drives. This month, the company announced an 8-terabyte hard drive geared toward business users.\n\nLast month, Seagate announced it would acquire Dot Hill Systems Corp. in Longmont for $694 million. The storage software firm employs 260. The deal is expected to close by the end of the year.\n\nCEO Steve Luczo said in July that the market was challenging and hard to predict. The company\u2019s fourth-quarter net income dropped to $138 million, compared with the prior year\u2019s $320 million. Revenues fell 11 percent to $2.9 billion.\n\n\u201cWe downgraded them just last week,\u201d said Mark Miller, an analyst with Menlo Park, Calif.-based The Benchmark Company. \u201cWe\u2019re definitely concerned about them.\u201d\n\nMiller said Seagate\u2019s earnings have dropped significantly over the past three years \u2014 down more than 35 percent, compared with 7.5 percent at peer Western Digital.\n\nMiller also said the company\u2019s cash position appeared weak, especially in light of its recent $694 million purchase of Longmont-based competitor Dot Hill Systems.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why I think they\u2019re taking these measures,\u201d Miller said. \u201cIt\u2019s not the best scenario when you\u2019ve got to cut people and reduce costs just to make your earnings look good.\u201d\n\nThe Longmont employees were notified of the layoffs Wednesday and will receive severance packages, the company said.\n\n\u201cGiven the complexities of Seagate\u2019s markets and business, along with the investments that need to be made, it is necessary that the company continually review its operations and spending, making adjustments as needed,\u201d Martini said. \u201cUnfortunately, at times, the workforce is affected by these decisions.\u201d\n\nDaily Camera staff writer Shay Castle contributed to this report.\n\nTamara Chuang: 303-954-1209, tchuang@denverpost.com or twitter.com/Gadgetress", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Seagate lays off 70 in Longmont, 1,000 companywide", "title": "Seagate lays off 70 in Longmont, 1,000 companywide", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/09/09/seagate-lays-off-70-in-longmont-1000-companywide/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150909__seagatep1.jpg", "height": 378}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150909__seagatep1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-09-09T16:40:25+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-22T00:36:53+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fddeff\"", "article_summary": "The Longmont employees affected in the layoffs work in the design center, which is one of two nationwide.\nAs of mid-August, Seagate employed 1,400 people in Longmont who worked on the company\u2019s core storage technology.\nComputer storage maker Seagate Technology said it laid off about 70 workers at its Longmont operation Wednesday, or about 5 percent of its Colorado workforce.\nLast month, Seagate announced it would acquire Dot Hill Systems Corp. in Longmont for $694 million.\n\u201cUnfortunately, at times, the workforce is affected by these decisions.\u201dDaily Camera staff writer Shay Castle contributed to this report."}
