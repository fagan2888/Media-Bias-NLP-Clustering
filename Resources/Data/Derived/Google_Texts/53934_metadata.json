Now, imagine how much longer that program might have been if it included all the comedians Lorne Michaels gave the axe to throughout its 40-year run.\n\nThe 70-year-old exec has notoriously given it straight to many featured performers on the show \u2014 and tonight, while the \u201cSNL\u201d family romps around the stage celebrating Michaels\u2019 brainchild, others will surely be tuning in from afar and regarding their brief stints on the show as a small hiccup in an otherwise wildly successful career.\n\nHere\u2019s to all the celebs who didn\u2019t need Lorne Michaels, anyway.\n\n(Honorable mentions go to Lisa Kudrow, Stephen Colbert and Steve Carell who weren\u2019t even fortunate to make it through the audition phase of the show.)\n\nDamon Wayans (1985-86)\n\nAfter rising tensions over his sketches not being selected for the show, Wayans decided to take matters into his own hands. During the sketch \u201cMr. Monopoly,\u201d in which Wayans was asked to play a hard-nose cop, he went off script and played it as effeminately as possible. Reflecting on this decision, he told The Weekender in a recent interview:\n\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t let me do what I wanted to do on \u2018SNL,\u2019 which I came to learn was Lorne Michaels\u2019 way of protecting me from looking like I was trying to be the next Eddie Murphy. It was right after Eddie Murphy left the show and they weren\u2019t letting me do things that he would do. So, I went against the script. That was my frustration.\u201d\n\nNeedless to say, Michaels was not pleased with the creative license he took and fired the actor after that night\u2019s taping.\n\nJenny Slate (2009-10)\n\nWhat with a critically acclaimed indie under her belt, a recurring role on \u201cParks & Recreation,\u201d and the runaway success of her \u201cMarcel the Shell\u201d character, it\u2019s fair to say that Slate is doing pretty OK for herself \u2014 even after her terribly tragic (but kind of metal?) slip-up on \u201cSNL.\u201d During Slate\u2019s big debut alongside Kristen Wiig, Slate dropped an F-bomb on live television and was asked to leave. On Jesse Thorn\u2019s podcast, \u201cBullseye with Jesse Thorn,\u201d Slate noted that Lorne Michaels had a very diplomatic and gentle way of letting her go from the show. Recapping what went wrong on live television, Slate said:\n\n\u201cI was so used to being a stand-up comedian, and I had written that sketch. I never thought of it as something I could make a mistake at. I knew all the rules and everything. It just it never crossed my mind that I would make a mistake.\u201d\n\nJoan Cusack (1985-1986)\n\nThe 11th season cast of \u201cSNL\u201d wasn\u2019t a tremendously lucky bunch. (Indeed, most were not asked to return the following year.) Among them, Joan Cusack, now twice nominated for an Academy Award, was widely known as the Chicagoan alt-girl who just didn\u2019t find \u201cOut of Africa\u201d that funny. During her brief stay, she filled the role of \u201cSelina\u201d the awkward girlfriend to Jon Lovitz\u2019s character, Biff.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Robert Downey Jr., Sarah Silverman, Gilbert Gottfried \u2014 these celebs hardly needed Lorne Michaels, anyway", "title": "The lost stars of \u201cSNL\u201d: 8 famous performers who bombed on Saturday night", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Robert Downey Jr., Sarah Silverman, Gilbert Gottfried \u2014 these celebs hardly needed Lorne Michaels, anyway", "title": "The lost stars of \u201cSNL\u201d: 8 famous performers who bombed on Saturday night", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/02/15/the_lost_stars_of_snl_8_famous_performers_who_bombed_on_saturday_night/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/robert_downey_jr.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Robert Downey Jr., Sarah Silverman, Gilbert Gottfried \u2014 these celebs hardly needed Lorne Michaels, anyway", "title": "The lost stars of \u201cSNL\u201d: 8 famous performers who bombed on Saturday night", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/robert_downey_jr.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Colin Gorenstein", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Comedy, Entertainment, jenny slate, sara silverman, Saturday Night Live, snl 40", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Now, imagine how much longer that program might have been if it included all the comedians Lorne Michaels gave the axe to throughout its 40-year run.\nHere\u2019s to all the celebs who didn\u2019t need Lorne Michaels, anyway.\nslip-up on \u201cSNL.\u201d During Slate\u2019s big debut alongside Kristen Wiig, Slate dropped an F-bomb on live television and was asked to leave.\nTopics: Comedy, Entertainment, jenny slate, sara silverman, Saturday Night Live, snl 40, Entertainment News, NewsNBC had a hard enough time packing its star-studded alums into a reasonably sized time slot \u2014 finally settling on 3 1/2 hours \u2014 for tonight\u2019s \u201cSNL 40\u2033 broadcast.\nOn Jesse Thorn\u2019s podcast, \u201cBullseye with Jesse Thorn,\u201d Slate noted that Lorne Michaels had a very diplomatic and gentle way of letting her go from the show."}
