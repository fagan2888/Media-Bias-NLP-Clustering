Since then the company has performed energy audits on over 10 million square feet of federal facilities nationwide. Keres participated in the beta testing of the EMAT software during its development phases. The EMAT LLC will provide Keres\u2019 energy engineers with the EMAT software allowing for a higher quality and more efficient energy audit by those onsite.\n\nRELATED: Keres Consulting Graduates From Nine-Year SBA 8(a) Program\n\n\u201cThe energy conservation industry has grown alongside regulatory action tied to building sustainability and energy reduction. We\u2019ve seen innovation on the product side with new lighting, metering, and so forth. EMAT brings the innovation to the service side,\u201d said Tim Chavez, Keres\u2019 President and CEO and member of the LLC. \u201cIt is good to be on this side of innovation.\u201d\n\nThe Small Disadvantaged Business is working to leverage the EMAT for collaboration with large businesses and Energy Service Companies requiring energy audits.\n\n\u201cThrough EMAT, Keres can respond to energy audit requirements with credentialed, certified energy managers, but at a fraction of the cost,\u201d Chavez said. \u201cLarge businesses and agencies can meet their budget requirements without having to compromise on the quality of services provided at a lower price.\u201d\n\nFederal facilities are required by law to report progress in energy efficiency. The ASHRAE Level II energy audit provides facilities with a comprehensive assessment of energy use and provides recommendations to reduce the consumption of energy in that building. According to a 2013 DOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy report, federal facilities consumed 306.7 trillion BTUs in 2012.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Keres Consulting, Inc. a Native-owned company announced the formation of a Limited Liability Company on September 29.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.creator": "kpolisse", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/10/08/keres-energy-team-signs-emat-move-sustainability-innovation-157240", "type": "article", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/article_media/tim_chavez_ceo_and_president_keres_consulting.jpg", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "title": "Keres Energy Team Signs With EMAT in a Move of Sustainability Innovation"}, "dcterms.date": "2014-10-08T14:00-04:00", "dc": {"title": "Keres Energy Team Signs With EMAT in a Move of Sustainability Innovation"}, "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/10/08/keres-energy-team-signs-emat-move-sustainability-innovation-157240", "robots": "follow, index", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Keres Consulting, Efficient Mobile Audit Technology, EMATASHRAE Level II, Native-Owned Company, Limited Liability Company, Tim Chavez, Energy Audits, U.S. Small Business Administration, 8(a) Business Development Program, Small Business, Small Disadvantaged Business, Minority-Owned, Native American-Owned", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 0}, "dcterms.title": "Keres Energy Team Signs With EMAT in a Move of Sustainability Innovation"}, "article_summary": "The EMAT LLC will provide Keres\u2019 energy engineers with the EMAT software allowing for a higher quality and more efficient energy audit by those onsite.\nThe ASHRAE Level II energy audit provides facilities with a comprehensive assessment of energy use and provides recommendations to reduce the consumption of energy in that building.\n\u201cThrough EMAT, Keres can respond to energy audit requirements with credentialed, certified energy managers, but at a fraction of the cost,\u201d Chavez said.\nAccording to a 2013 DOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy report, federal facilities consumed 306.7 trillion BTUs in 2012.\nRELATED: Keres Consulting Graduates From Nine-Year SBA 8(a) Program\u201cThe energy conservation industry has grown alongside regulatory action tied to building sustainability and energy reduction."}
