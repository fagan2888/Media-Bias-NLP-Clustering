If this were a well-functioning economy with good jobs, Medicaid rolls would be shrinking and Americans would be coming self sufficient.\n\nLeave aside the question of whether supply-siders know anything at all about how to achieve prosperity; even when prosperity does come, or at least when they can claim it has come, how does this affect health insurance? Specifically, how did insurance rolls evolve during the reign of Saint Reagan?\n\nThe standard Census data don\u2019t go back that far, but the CDC has made estimates for the population under 65. As you can see from the chart, Morning in America did nothing to boost insurance \u2014 in fact, the share of Americans with private coverage declined, and because Medicaid din\u2019t grow the overall rate of uninsurance rose from 12 percent in 1980 to 15.6 percent in 1989.\n\nIn other words, nothing in the economic record \u2014 not even the record of the great conservative hero \u2014 suggests that you can grow your way into universal health coverage.", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20150704100343, "BN": "krugman", "dfp-ad-unit-path": "opinion/krugman", "DISPLAYDATE": "July 4, 2015", "keywords": "Uncategorized", "communityAssetTaxonomy": "blogs/krugman/Insurance and Reaganomics ( 20150704 )", "PT": "Blogs", "SCG": "krugman", "sourceApp": "blogs", "twitter": {"description": "No morning in that aspect of America.", "title": "Insurance and Reaganomics", "url": "http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/07/04/insurance-and-reaganomics/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "site": "@NytimesKrugman", "card": "summary"}, "adxPage": "blog.nytimes.com/krugman/post", "description": "No morning in that aspect of America.", "CG": "Opinion", "robots": "noodp", "dat": "July 4, 2015", "article": {"published_time": 1436018623, "author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/opinion/editorialsandoped/oped/columnists/paulkrugman/index.html", "section": "Opinion", "collection": "http://json8.nytimes.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "tag": "Uncategorized", "modified_time": "2015-07-04T14:04:25-04:00"}, "utime": 20150704140425, "communityAssetLabels": "NYT_Blogs", "PUD": 20150704, "pdate": 20150704, "thumbnail": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "og": {"site_name": "Paul Krugman Blog", "description": "No morning in that aspect of America.", "title": "Insurance and Reaganomics", "url": "http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/07/04/insurance-and-reaganomics/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/blogs_v5/../icons/t_logo_291_black.png", "type": "article"}, "communityAssetURL": "http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/07/04/insurance-and-reaganomics/", "PUV": "normal", "hdl": "Insurance and Reaganomics", "thumbnail_150": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "PST": "Blog Post"}, "article_summary": "Specifically, how did insurance rolls evolve during the reign of Saint Reagan?\nLeave aside the question of whether supply-siders know anything at all about how to achieve prosperity; even when prosperity does come, or at least when they can claim it has come, how does this affect health insurance?\nIf this were a well-functioning economy with good jobs, Medicaid rolls would be shrinking and Americans would be coming self sufficient.\nIn other words, nothing in the economic record \u2014 not even the record of the great conservative hero \u2014 suggests that you can grow your way into universal health coverage.\nThe standard Census data don\u2019t go back that far, but the CDC has made estimates for the population under 65."}
