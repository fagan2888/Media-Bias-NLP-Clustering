Lest you think I\u2019m exaggerating, here is a little sample of Issac Bailey\u2018s well-intentioned but misguided column:\n\nHe shouldn\u2019t say much at all. He should go primarily to listen, even if it means he has to endure being called nasty names to his face or risk being spat on. Because when you cut through the political rhetoric and fearmongering and empty, overheated debates, that\u2019s the one thing people in those communities believe they haven\u2019t received and want most\u2014to be heard.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot more to the piece (which you should read in full before judging) than that, but it doesn\u2019t get much better than its headline \u2013 Why Obama Must Reach Out to Angry Whites.\n\nOn Twitter, black people have been delivering some blistering critiques of Bailey\u2019s piece, including the observations that the author of the piece is black, is engaging in \u201ctomfoolery,\u201d is perpetuating the \u201cmagical negro\u201d trope, and repeatedly identifies the burgeoning non-white majority as a \u201cproblem.\u201d Here are a couple of snippets on the latter counts:\n\nThe ugly rhetoric just might force the country to finally contend with a problem many don\u2019t even want to acknowledge exists: that we are fast becoming a nation in which minorities make up a majority of the population. \u2026But the current president\u2014the nation\u2019s first black president, born of a white mother, married to a descendant of slaves, father of 21st-century daughters\u2014can use the allure and mystique of his office to speak to the American public, and all of its myriad, divisive factions, in a way no one else can.\n\nYes, and maybe he can open his mouth up wide and let all of the racism fly into him, then die.\n\nSetting aside the fatally-flawed premise that it is President Obama\u2019s responsibility to sooth these people while he applies Bactine to the knuckles they\u2019ve been scraping on him for seven or eight years now, Bailey seems to have missed the single biggest moment of then-Senator Obama\u2019s 2008 campaign, and everything that followed it. Obama gave the biggest speech of his campaign in direct response to panicked Whitey, and in the middle of it, granted those fears a legitimacy that no other politician could have gotten away with:\n\nIn fact, a similar anger exists within segments of the white community. Most working- and middle-class white Americans don\u2019t feel that they have been particularly privileged by their race. Their experience is the immigrant experience \u2013 as far as they\u2019re concerned, no one\u2019s handed them anything, they\u2019ve built it from scratch. They\u2019ve worked hard all their lives, many times only to see their jobs shipped overseas or their pension dumped after a lifetime of labor. They are anxious about their futures, and feel their dreams slipping away; in an era of stagnant wages and global competition, opportunity comes to be seen as a zero sum game, in which your dreams come at my expense. So when they are told to bus their children to a school across town; when they hear that an African American is getting an advantage in landing a good job or a spot in a good college because of an injustice that they themselves never committed; when they\u2019re told that their fears about crime in urban neighborhoods are somehow prejudiced, resentment builds over time. Like the anger within the black community, these resentments aren\u2019t always expressed in polite company. But they have helped shape the political landscape for at least a generation. Anger over welfare and affirmative action helped forge the Reagan Coalition. Politicians routinely exploited fears of crime for their own electoral ends. Talk show hosts and conservative commentators built entire careers unmasking bogus claims of racism while dismissing legitimate discussions of racial injustice and inequality as mere political correctness or reverse racism. Just as black anger often proved counterproductive, so have these white resentments distracted attention from the real culprits of the middle class squeeze \u2013 a corporate culture rife with inside dealing, questionable accounting practices, and short-term greed; a Washington dominated by lobbyists and special interests; economic policies that favor the few over the many. And yet, to wish away the resentments of white Americans, to label them as misguided or even racist, without recognizing they are grounded in legitimate concerns \u2013 this too widens the racial divide, and blocks the path to understanding.\n\nThat speech, and particularly that section, may not have alone carried him to victory, but are what got Barack Obama through the turnstile and onto the platform. Once he arrived, President Obama did everything he could to let Whitey know he was going to be \u201ceveryone\u2019s president,\u201d a fact you can check by googling \u201cApril Ryan Press briefing\u201d and listening to the responses she got every time she pressed this White House about black issues.\n\nBut hours before he was even inaugurated, Obama was being conspired against by Whitey\u2019s party, so it didn\u2019t matter how much he reached out to them, it was never going to happen. The fact is, though, he reached out plenty. The mainstream political media never shut up about how \u201caloof\u201d Obama should schmooze more, but fell eerily silent when John Boehner confessed that it wasn\u2019t Obama who was afraid of getting cooties:\n\nThe president has suggested, \u2018Hey, do you think it would be too much trouble to play golf again?\u2019 I have to look at him and say, \u2018Yes,\u2019 Because everybody gets bent out of shape, worried about what we\u2019re up to, when all we\u2019re about to do is play golf.\n\nIt\u2019s a little tough to swallow that President Obama bears responsibility for straightening out resentful White America when the alleged \u201cgood guy\u201d in the Republican race, Jeb Bush, is going around telling people that the Confederacy \u201cshould be respected\u201d (yes, that happened):\n\nThe fact is, there is a whole galaxy of people between Trump and Obama who could chill these folks out, but who won\u2019t.\n\nThe appeal of Bailey\u2019s premise, if there is one, is that old \u201cright or wrong\u201d saw, that even if it\u2019s not Obama\u2019s fault, he should still step up and try to do something about the tide of resentment that Trump is riding. Even on those grounds, though, going on tour to let Trumpians vent their spittle on him is not going to help. They don\u2019t feel ignored, there is an entire media infrastructure devoted to amplifying them, and an entire political party with a long history of diddling them under the table. They will not be sated.\n\nThere is a widely-held political misunderstanding about White America that fuels this kind of thinking. There are actually three White Americas: the Trump America that\u2019s either balls-out racist or feels \u201cunderstandable\u201d resentment, the \u201cReagan Democrats\u201d who recognize racial injustice but can be persuaded to ignore it in their own self-interest, and liberal White America, who will keep racial justice somewhere on the menu, depending on whatever else they\u2019ve got going at the time. Only two of those White Americas are reachable, and Trump America ain\u2019t one of them.\n\nIt\u2019s that second group that needs to be worked on, and to the extent that he can, President Obama has done that. It was these voters Obama was playing footsie with when he called on Muslims to root out radical ideology in the wake of the San Bernardino attacks. The best thing he can do now is to keep killing terrorists and rescuing the economy, because no matter what he says, the media is only amplifying Trump.\n\nNo, the person who\u2019s best positioned to reach those other two White Americas is Hillary Clinton, and she needs to do it by explaining something that no other politician has quite managed to: how it is that things like racial justice, reproductive freedom, and religious inclusion are in white voters\u2019 direct self-interest. Too often, these issues are discussed in terms of lofty principles of fairness or spiritual adherence to American ideals, which is nice, but which the middle third or so of white people will throw overboard in favor of what they see as practical considerations.\n\nFor example, I\u2019m betting that the overwhelming majority of white people recognize that racial discrimination plays at least some part in employment disparities, but a similar percentage probably see correcting that problem as damaging to themselves. If a black person gets something, then a white person isn\u2019t getting it. What I never hear any politician argue is that when employers pay black workers 75 cents on the dollar, they are not giving that extra 25 cents to white workers, any more than slave owners used the money they saved on paying slaves to shower white workers with generosity. Pay disparities depress wages for everyone.\n\nObama won twice, so those voters can be reached. President Obama can do his part through actions, but somebody else needs to talk to these people. Obama will be gone in 12 months, and his replacement will be whomever explains to a majority of Americans, white and non-white, what\u2019s in it for them.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A well-intentioned column gives way to a well-reasoned backlash.", "generator": "WordPress 2016.21", "og": {"image": "http://static01.mediaite.com/med/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/politico-e1451156463647.jpg", "title": "Black People Not Amused by Politico Suggestion That Obama Reach Out to Whitey"}, "twitter": {"description": "A well-intentioned column gives way to a well-reasoned backlash.", "title": "Black People Not Amused by Politico Suggestion That Obama Reach Out to Whitey", "image": "http://static01.mediaite.com/med/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/politico-e1451156463647.jpg", "creator": "@TommyXtopher", "site": "@mediaite", "card": "summary"}, "NextGEN": "1.5.5", "date": "2015-12-26T14:32:47+00:00", "keywords": "columnists,online,opinion", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.5, minimum-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "President Obama can do his part through actions, but somebody else needs to talk to these people.\nIt\u2019s that second group that needs to be worked on, and to the extent that he can, President Obama has done that.\nThere is a widely-held political misunderstanding about White America that fuels this kind of thinking.\nOnly two of those White Americas are reachable, and Trump America ain\u2019t one of them.\nYes, and maybe he can open his mouth up wide and let all of the racism fly into him, then die."}
