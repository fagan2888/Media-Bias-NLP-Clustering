Her plan is to give away \u201conly\u201d $35 billion a year for public college and university tuition by eliminating some unspecified deductions available to high-income earners, though she isn\u2019t too specific about the details. She is specific about taxing \u201cthe rich\u201d to pay for everyone\u2019s \u201cfree\u201d public college and university education.\n\nThese are rather sad political postures to a very real issue. About 43 million Americans owe student debt. That includes 37 percent of households headed by someone younger than 40 years old, up from 22 percent in 2001.\n\nEconomist Diana Furchgott-Roth, co-author of \u201cDisinherited: How Washington is Betraying America\u2019s Young,\u201d told me the number of students owing $200,000 has tripled since 2004. \u201cStudent loan debt has increased 325 percent, putting incredible pressure on families and young adults.\u201d\n\nAnd how did this come about?\n\nThe government created the environment for colleges and universities to dramatically raise tuition costs to pay for administrators, not professors, and construction projects.\n\nThe ugly truth is that big-government liberals now want to use the government to try to solve a problem the government created.\n\nThe New York Federal Reserve published a research paper last month where researchers discovered colleges and universities \u201c\u2026in the subsidized federal loan program increased their tuition disproportionately around these policy changes, with a sizable pass-through effect on tuition of about 65 percent.\u201d\n\nThe more money the government doled out as college loans, the more colleges increased their tuitions.\n\n\u201cYearly student loan originations grew from $53 billion to $120 billion between 2001 and 2012, with about 90 percent of originations in recent years occurring through federal student aid programs,\u201d the report notes. \u201cAgainst this backdrop of increased borrowing, average sticker tuition rose 46 percent in constant 2012 dollars between 2001 and 2012, from $6,950 to $10,200, resembling the twin house price and mortgage balance booms.\u201d\n\nSo, what will happen if Sanders, O\u2019Malley or Clinton give these colleges and universities even more unfettered cash?\n\nSure, they can say these institutions have to cut spending, but don\u2019t count on it.\n\nEconomist Furchgott-Roth doubts there\u2019s $75 billion a year for Sanders to confiscate.\n\nCapital is international in nature. At that level, it has no borders.\n\nSomeone\u2019s going to have to pay and it won\u2019t be the Democratic president.\n\nThe political profit for Sanders and Company is very real. Anyone who\u2019s against taxing the rich to pay for everyone else\u2019s college will be vilified as \u201cheartless\u201d and \u201cserving wall street\u201d while the grassroots liberals pack stadiums to cheer for Sanders and the hedge funds donate feverishly to Hillary\u2019s campaign.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://delonline.us/1NvaYVg", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Big-government liberals now want to use the government to try to solve government problems.", "p": {"domain_verify": "815a1068696ac12ba65bd5231740d78d"}, "og": {"site_name": "delawareonline", "description": "Big-government liberals now want to use the government to try to solve government problems.", "title": "Democrats are promising more free stuff", "url": "http://www.delawareonline.com/story/opinion/contributors/2015/08/14/democrats-promising-free-stuff/31733061/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/delawareonline.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Big-government liberals now want to use the government to try to solve government problems.", "title": "Democrats are promising more free stuff", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/ff0ab8b218736058949fcc24e613d4a4c0ef7c36/c=0-124-2600-2724&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/08/14/Wilmington/B9318457807Z.1_20150814154313_000_G4BBKFVQJ.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@delawareonline", "site": "@delawareonline", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600071892", "fb": {"app_id": 175037755863662}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070"}, "article_summary": "Bernie figures he can confiscate about $75 billion every year from investors to pay for free college for everyone.\nShe is specific about taxing \u201cthe rich\u201d to pay for everyone\u2019s \u201cfree\u201d public college and university education.\nRick Jensen (Photo: CagelCartoons)Democrat Bernie Sanders has hit upon a popular theme for his presidential campaign: \u201cFree Stuff for Voters!\u201d Martin O\u2019Malley and Hillary Clinton have hitched a ride on the wagon, too.\nFast-forward to the recent Netroots conference where Sanders and O\u2019Malley were yelled at by a black man who says he \u201ccan\u2019t afford\u201d Obamacare.\n\u201cStudent loan debt has increased 325 percent, putting incredible pressure on families and young adults.\u201dAnd how did this come about?"}
