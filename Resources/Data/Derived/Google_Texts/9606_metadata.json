Dzau, president of the National Academy of Medicine, said during a press conference announcing the findings. \"Diagnostic errors are a significant contributor to patient harm and have received too little attention until now... Errors in diagnosis ... can persist throughout all segments of care and continue to harm, in my mind, an unacceptable number of patients.\"\n\nThere are no reliable numbers on how many diagnostic errors occur, but recent research concludes that doctors make 12 million outpatient diagnostic errors each year--roughly one in every 20 diagnosis. The report calls for greater measurement of these errors by all healthcare organizations.\n\nIn order to reduce diagnostic errors, researchers said the industry must improve diagnosis in healthcare. This will involve more effective teamwork among clinicians and patients; improved training and education for healthcare professionals; a payment and care delivery environment that supports the diagnostic process and a dedicated focus on new research.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Despite sparse data on the extent of misdiagnosis in the healthcare industry, best estimates indicate that most people will experience at least one diagnostic error in their lifetime,\u00a0sometimes with devastating consequences, according to the long-awaited Institute of Medicine\u00a0report, \"Improving Diagnosis in Health Care.\"", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "Despite sparse data on the extent of misdiagnosis in the healthcare industry, best estimates indicate that most people will experience at least one diagnostic error in their lifetime,\u00a0sometimes with devastating consequences, according to the long-awaited Institute of Medicine\u00a0report, \"Improving Diagnosis in Health Care.\"", "title": "IOM: Most patients will experience a misdiagnosis in their lifetime", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/iom-most-patients-will-experience-misdiagnosis-their-lifetime/2015-09-22", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "Care Delivery,Diagnostic Errors,electronic health records (EHRs),institute of medicine,interoperability,medical errors,misdiagnosis,Patient Care & Outcomes,patient engagement,patient safety", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Care Delivery,Patient Care & Outcomes"}, "article_summary": "\"Diagnostic errors are a significant contributor to patient harm and have received too little attention until now...\nErrors in diagnosis ... can persist throughout all segments of care and continue to harm, in my mind, an unacceptable number of patients.\"\nIn order to reduce diagnostic errors, researchers said the industry must improve diagnosis in healthcare.\nThere are no reliable numbers on how many diagnostic errors occur, but recent research concludes that doctors make 12 million outpatient diagnostic errors each year--roughly one in every 20 diagnosis.\nDespite sparse data on the extent of misdiagnosis in the healthcare industry, best estimates indicate that most people will experience at least one diagnostic error in their lifetime, sometimes with devastating consequences, according to the long-awaited Institute of Medicine report, \"Improving Diagnosis in Health Care,\" released today."}
