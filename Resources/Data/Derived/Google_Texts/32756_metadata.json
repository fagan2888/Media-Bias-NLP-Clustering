Bradley Byrne, R-Ala., said Wednesday on C-SPAN. \u201cWhat the president proposed yesterday will not affect this problem at all.\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday, President Barack Obama announced executive actions, independent of Congress, that he said would reduce what he calls gun violence.\n\n\u201cThis is not an abstract issue for me,\u201d Byrne said, adding:\n\nMy grandfather was shot and killed by a mentally ill person. And it devastated my family. It devastated my mother and grandmother and my two uncles. So when we talk about people who have been shot by mentally ill people, I understand it. I understand what it does to the victims.\n\nByrne\u2019s grandfather was shot by a mentally ill man in Mobile, Ala., before the Great Depression.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to solve this problem if we\u2019re not going to talk about changing the mental health policy of the United States,\u201d Byrne, 60, told C-SPAN host John McArdle.\n\n>>> Psychologist Congressman Prescribes Mental Health Fix for Mass Shootings\n\nWashington Post reporter Amber Phillips wrote about Byrne\u2019s personal story, noting the congressman had not talked much about this part of his family\u2019s past \u201cuntil he came to Congress and a number of shootings by mentally ill people dominated the news.\u201d\n\nAfter the murder, Byrne\u2019s family did not turn to gun control as a solution, Phillips reported Wednesday:\n\nInstead, Byrne said his family focused on the fact that there are people in Alabama and the United States who are mentally ill and precautions need to be taken to keep them and their families and their communities safe.\n\nByrne, a second-term congressman, is a co-sponsor of a bill introduced by Rep. Tim Murphy, R-Pa., that aims to overhaul the nation\u2019s mental health care system.\n\n\u201cEvery one of these mass shootings that we\u2019ve seen in the last couple of years in America, the guns were purchased legally through a gun dealer who did background checks,\u201d Byrne said in the C-SPAN interview, adding:\n\nAt some point, you\u2019ve got to say, \u2018Now wait a minute, there\u2019s the responsibility of the person that has the gun.\u2019 \u2026 Don\u2019t penalize the other 90-plus percent of people in America who buy guns legally and use them legally and don\u2019t hurt anybody because we have a tiny percentage of people who have violated that.\n\n>>> The Facts Behind 4 of Obama\u2019s Claims on Guns", "article_metadata": {"description": "\"This is not an abstract issue for me,\" says Rep.
