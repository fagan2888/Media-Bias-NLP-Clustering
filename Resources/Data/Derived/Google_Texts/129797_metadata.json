She delivered an emphatic call to arms for the female vote this November in the midterm elections.\n\nThe forum today also came a day after Wasserman Schultz was honored at the Kennedy Center by the Susan G. Komen breast cancer foundation after surviving a bout with the disease in 2008 while in Congress.\n\nIn the comprehensive examination of Wasserman Schultz's legacy, Politico reported widespread tension and frustration with her term in office. She was painted as a self-interested executive in service of her own political career. According to the report, President Obama's close advisers had readied a replacement for her after the 2012 election, but eventually decided to keep her in place.\n\nDespite the unspoken irritation, Wasserman Schultz has overseen a DNC that cleared its debt and created a surplus. It currently heads into the midterms with $7 million to spend on its candidates, many of whom face uphill fights to reclaim or take over congressional seats.\n\nBut for those following press coverage of Wasserman Schultz this week, the elephant in the room seemed to be present for the biggest names in Democratic politics. Biden, Clinton and Obama wasted no time in defending her.\n\n\"I've worked with a lot of great chairpersons of the Democratic Party. \u2026 I've campaigned for thousands of candidates over the years, literally,\" Biden said. \"But I've never seen anybody work as hard and as tirelessly as Debbie has.\"\n\n\"And by the way, if we want anybody to do that 60 seconds or 120 seconds we get to respond to some attack on the president or on the administration, the best person \u2026 is always Debbie,\" Biden added.\n\nHillary Clinton was even more resolute.", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Defending Debbie Wasserman Schultz", "description": "Defending Debbie Wasserman Schultz", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 ABC News Internet Ventures", "author": "ABC News", "og": {"url": "http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2014/09/defending-debbie-wasserman-schultz-obama-biden-clinton-rush-to-chairwomans-side/", "site_name": "ABC News", "description": "Obama, Biden, Clinton rush to defend Democratic chairwoman.", "title": "Defending Debbie Wasserman Schultz"}, "robots": "index, follow", "fb": {"admins": 704409894, "app_id": 4942312939}, "keywords": "Barack Obama, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, Democratic National Committee, hillary clinton, Joe Biden, politics news, election news, political news, political news articles", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "(Manuel Balce Ceneta/AP Photo)Congresswoman and Democratic National Committee Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz suddenly has a lot of friends.\nBiden, Clinton and Obama wasted no time in defending her.\nDespite the unspoken irritation, Wasserman Schultz has overseen a DNC that cleared its debt and created a surplus.\nIn the comprehensive examination of Wasserman Schultz's legacy, Politico reported widespread tension and frustration with her term in office.\nBut for those following press coverage of Wasserman Schultz this week, the elephant in the room seemed to be present for the biggest names in Democratic politics."}
