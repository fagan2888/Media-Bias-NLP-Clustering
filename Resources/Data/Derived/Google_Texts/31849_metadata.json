Prior to the vote, Casey said in an interview about abortion funding and the bill, \"I've never drawn a line in the sand on any issue.\"\n\nCasey announced last year his support of same-sex marriage. In a statement posted to his website, Casey said, \u201cAfter much deliberation and after reviewing the legal, public policy, and civil rights questions presented, I support marriage equality for same-sex couples and believe that DOMA should be repealed.\u201d\n\nBishop Joseph Bambera of Scranton, Pennsylvania, said of that decision, \u201cSenator Casey has unfortunately and disappointingly set aside the Catholic belief and teaching that the sacrament of marriage, rooted in the natural law, is a faithful, exclusive, lifelong, loving union of a man and a woman open to the transmission of human life\u2026 Senator Casey\u2019s position is contrary to the teaching of the Catholic Church.\u201d\n\nLast year, the Diocese of Allentown protested Casey\u2019s lecture at Alvernia University, noting his growing disparity with the teachings of the Catholic Church. A diocesan statement read:\n\nThe Diocese of Allentown was not consulted in advance of Alvernia University's decision to invite Senator Casey to speak at the school even though the Senator is increasingly in disagreement with the Church on issues involving Church teaching. Bishop Barres' concerns have been communicated directly to the leadership of the University.\n\nCasey\u2019s spokesman reportedly said in response that the senator\u2019s Catholic faith \u201chas always informed and inspired him, but it does not specifically dictate how he votes on matters of public policy as a representative of 12.8 million Pennsylvanians of many faiths.\u201d\n\nThe Catechism of the Catholic Church says of direct abortion it is \u201cgravely contrary to the moral law\u201d and the Church teaches that marriage is between a man and a woman.\n\nIn the press release on the commencement ceremony, Notre Dame mentions that Casey is a member of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions and that he volunteered for a year as an educator in an inner-city Philadelphia school.\n\nFather Timothy Scully, C.S.C., a co-founder of the Alliance for Catholic Education, invoked the importance of children in discussing the program, saying in the release, \u201cWe are blessed with talented and faith-filled graduates seeking to extend the gift of a great Catholic school education to as many children as possible\u2026They remind us that every child, especially the most vulnerable, must have the opportunity for a quality education.\u201d\n\nCatholic Education Daily is an online publication of The Cardinal Newman Society.
