He added that AARP will also educate caregivers statewide about their rights under the new law.\n\n\"With the vast majority of older Pennsylvanians wanting to remain in their homes and communities as they age, the contribution of family caregivers cannot be overlooked,\" said Johnston-Walsh. \"Without the help of family caregivers, too many of our seniors would end up in costly institutions \u2013 often paid for by the state, through Medicaid.\"\n\nApproval of the CARE Act makes Pennsylvania the 23rd state to approve similar legislation designed to help family caregivers.\n\n\"While they would not have it any other way, family caregiving is a big job,\" said Johnston-Walsh. \"Pennsylvania's CARE Act will make that job a little easier.\"\n\nAARP has 1.8 million members in Pennsylvania.
