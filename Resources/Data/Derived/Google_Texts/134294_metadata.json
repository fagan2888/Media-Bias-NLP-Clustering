Pavel Jones, 18, of 506 S. Fourth St. in Mebane, was charged with spontaneous speed competition and careless and reckless driving. McCray Williams, 16, of 1426 Payne Road in Graham, was charged with aiding and abetting a pre-arranged speed competition.\n\nAuthorities said Desmond Piccini, of Mebane, was eastbound on Lebanon Road on April 2 when his 1989 Ford Mustang ran off onto the right shoulder of the road near Mill Creek Road. Piccini over-corrected, and the car crossed over the road, hit a rock wall along the westbound shoulder and flipped onto its hood.\n\nPiccini died in the crash, and Williams, who was riding in his car, suffered minor injuries.\n\nClevenger had a 13-year-old passenger in his car, which led to the child abuse charge, Trooper Michael Baker said.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30;polling-uri=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wral.com/rss/48&id=1;polling-uri2=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wral.com/rss/48&id=2;polling-uri3=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wral.com/rss/48&id=3;polling-uri4=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wral.com/rss/48&id=4;polling-uri5=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wral.com/rss/48&id=5;cycle=1", "dcterms.created": "2014-05-14 10:41:00", "description": "The State Highway Patrol said Wednesday that street racing charges have been filed against three people in an April crash near Mebane that killed a 16-year-old.", "application-name": "WRAL.com", "dcterms.modified": "2014-05-14 12:21:34", "outbrain": {"ob_desc": "id_asset=13643866|asset_type=story"}, "twitter": {"description": "The State Highway Patrol said Wednesday that street racing charges have been filed against three people in an April crash near Mebane that killed a 16-year-old.", "title": "Racing charges filed in fatal Mebane crash :: WRAL.com", "url": "http://www.wral.com/racing-charges-filed-in-fatal-mebane-crash/13643866/", "image": "http://wwwcache.wral.com/asset/news/local/2006/06/15/158999/1053272-1464213750-160x120.jpg", "site": "@wral", "card": "summary"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#041E30", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "/favicons/mstile-70x70.png", "robots": "index,follow", "pinterest": "nohover", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "/favicons/mstile-310x310.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "/favicons/mstile-310x150.png", "fb": {"app_id": 334167666672300}, "author": "WRAL", "article": {"published_time": "2014-05-14T10:41:00-04:00"}, "msapplication-square150x150logo": "/favicons/mstile-150x150.png", "og": {"site_name": "WRAL.com", "description": "The State Highway Patrol said Wednesday that street racing charges have been filed against three people in an April crash near Mebane that killed a 16-year-old.", "title": "Racing charges filed in fatal Mebane crash :: WRAL.com", "url": "http://www.wral.com/racing-charges-filed-in-fatal-mebane-crash/13643866/", "image": "http://wwwcache.wral.com/asset/news/local/2006/06/15/158999/1448853534-wral-930x411.jpg", "type": "article"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "msapplication-TileImage": "/favicons/mstile-144x144.png"}, "article_summary": "Pavel Jones, 18, of 506 S.
