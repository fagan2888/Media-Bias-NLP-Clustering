Those that pertain to young people, at best, are full of immature phrasing and poor grammar and seek to appeal to such a demographic through drinking, birth control, and sex.\n\nKristi Burton Brown has already written on the matter. As a young person, I am particularly offended.\n\nAs mentioned by Kristi, many thought the ads were mocking ObamaCare. In fact, as reporting from TheBlaze mentions, even Planned Parenthood Votes Colorado thought that the ad was a parody and that it contained \u201cslutshaming.\u201d\n\nTheBlaze also links to a piece from Business Insider, which includes a statement from Adam Fox, Director of Strategic Engagement for the Colorado Consumer Health Initiative, one of the groups responsible for the ads:\n\n\u201cWe wanted to come up with a campaign that would attract attention and inject a bit of humor, and try to approach educating people about health insurance a little bit differently,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was really just brainstorming, \u2018OK, what are some of those risky activities we could work with that would tie it all together?\u2019\u201d\n\nThe creators behind the ad may have tried to \u201cattract attention and inject a bit of humor,\u201d but Fox and his group could have made the ads funny without being so demeaning.\n\nFox also refers to \u201csome of those risky activities,\u201d but in the ad, they\u2019re not portrayed as risky. One of the main complaints surrounding the \u201cLet\u2019s Get Physical\u201d ad is that it just barely warns that birth control pills do not protect against sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), in saying at the bottom, in fine print, that only \u201ccondoms and common sense do that.\u201d Perhaps common sense could also come into play when considering whether one should have sex with someone he or she has just met.\n\nThere is another ad that mentions birth control. This ad does not mention STDs at all.\n\nIt\u2019s not just that the ads fail to adequately address the physical health risks of sex, but that there is no mention of emotional consequences, particularly when it comes to the easy and casual sex represented in these ads. And I\u2019m not even using the term \u201ceasy\u201d on my own. Both of the birth control ads use it, in being \u201cexcited about easy access to birth control\u201d with the \u201cHey Girl 1\u201d ad and hoping that the guy in the \u201cLet\u2019s Get Physical\u201d ad is \u201cas easy to get as this birth control.\u201d All emphasis is original. The ads are suggesting not just that women are \u201ceasy,\u201d but that men are as well. The ads are offensive to both sexes.\n\nAccording to the ads, there are very few factors to consider when having sex with someone. The ad actually says \u201c\u2026all I have to worry about[.]\u201d Never mind that sex is an intimate act, with a lot of emotions involved, and the possibility for attachment. That\u2019s not a sexist statement; it\u2019s just the nature of sex.\n\nTo protect one\u2019s health, physically and emotionally, one should be aware of that. I don\u2019t expect a short ad to have a full disclaimer about every risk to sex, but the ads are being deceptive if they feature a young woman saying that since her \u201chealth insurance covers the pill \u2026 all [she has] to worry about is getting him between the covers.\u201d\n\nThe ads also completely reject the notion of personal responsibility. Why should birth control access have to be provided by one\u2019s employer in order to be easy? Before the HHS mandate required employers to provide it, birth control access was not impossible. And birth control has not been illegal, a move nobody is proposing, for almost fifty years.\n\nIt is not unreasonable to expect young people to have enough personal responsibility to afford their own birth control. I do not use birth control pills, not only as a Catholic, but also because the pill has health risks and other side effects and because some forms can act as an abortifacient. I do not believe that employees should depend on their employers to pay for their birth control even if it is used for other reasons. After all, I do not expect my employer to pay for my prescription medicine.\n\nI know so many young people who are concerned with more beyond who is paying for their birth control. They\u2019re worried about paying for school and getting a job. You would think that young people were obsessed with sex, though, from these ads. It\u2019s okay to have a passion for a wide range of issues, but how the \u201cGot Insurance?\u201d ad campaigns seek to appeal to young people is offensive and deceives my generation.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Live Action News", "description": "11 Like10 Tweet0 +11 By now you\u2019ve likely seen the \u201cGot Insurance?\u201d ads encouraging enrollment in ObamaCare \u2013 ads that are painfully cheesy and would be laughable if they weren\u2019t actually real.
