But the average time it takes to obtain services for children put on the wait list in January is 275 days, said Tina Gerber-Winn, deputy administrator for the state\u2019s Aging and Disability Services Division.\n\nThe wait list backlog began when the program started in 2009, Gerber-Winn said last week. The program gets referrals from multiple sources, including families, schools and health care providers.\n\n\u201cIt has slowly grown since people have become more aware,\u201d she said.\n\nAt the end of January, the state\u2019s autism treatment assistance program was serving 199 children, from those younger than a year up to 19. The state-funded program is closing an average of two cases per month because each case varies in therapy length. The average monthly cost per case in January was $1,233, but officials said that average changes, depending on how much therapy participants need.\n\nHowever, the program receives an average of 16 new requests for services a month, Gerber-Winn said.\n\nOnce in the program, a target is set for a child\u2019s improvement. A behavior analyst decides when the target has been met and closes a case, which sometimes can take years.\n\n\u201cWe only have the ability to service so many cases,\u201d said Gerber-Winn, adding that she understands families are upset because they\u2019ve been waiting so long for services.\n\nJose Sosa was identified as autistic when he was 3 years old and has received little treatment. He got six months of speech therapy soon after he was diagnosed, his mother said. He still uses diapers and can\u2019t speak in complete sentences.\n\nMaria Sosa submitted the first application to the state\u2019s autism program about three years ago but was later told her paperwork couldn\u2019t be found in the system. It\u2019s been a year since she submitted a second application, and her son has still not made it to the front of the line.\n\n\u201cHe is not functional,\u201d Maria Sosa said of Jose on Thursday night as she and the other mothers gathered at an east valley home to drink coffee and watch their children play. \u201cHe needs a lot of help. I know that all the children (on the wait list) need help, but my son really needs it.\u201d\n\nJose needs to be watched at all times. He also won\u2019t stay still and doesn\u2019t recognize danger.\n\n\u201cIf there\u2019s fire in front of him, he\u2019ll go up and grab it,\u201d Sosa said.\n\nShe hopes state officials will heed her call for help before it\u2019s too late for the therapy to make a difference for her son.\n\nChildren on the wait list are in desperate need of services but are languishing, said Barbara Buckley, executive director of the Legal Aid Center of Southern Nevada.\n\n\u201cIt makes no sense,\u201d she said last week. \u201cWe see the therapy makes a difference in their lives. \u2026 For them to sit on the waiting list when you know it can change their lives, it\u2019s just a travesty.\u201d\n\nThe issue is one of the highest priorities for the Legal Aid Center, Buckley said. She has been in communiation with Mike Willden, director of the Nevada Department of Health and Human Services, to see what can be done to speed up the process. They also plan to contact state lawmakers.\n\nLawsuits in Florida and Ohio directed the states to pay for applied behavior analysis treatment for autistic children under their Medicaid programs, Buckley said. Last fall, a federal appeals court upheld the order for Florida to offer the treatment under Medicaid.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s an angle that we are looking at,\u201d she said.\n\nThe Legal Aid Center\u2019s goal is for children to receive services as soon as possible. The center will keep all of its options open, including litigation if necessary, Buckley said.\n\nThe Legal Aid Center became aware of the issue because it represents an autistic foster child who needed treatment.\n\n\u201cBecause the cost of behavioral plans vary, it is necessary to balance the addition of new children to the program with the agency\u2019s budgeted authority,\u201d Gerber-Winn said.\n\nFor fiscal 2014, the program has a budget of $4.1 million. That increases to $7.7 million for fiscal 2015. Those budgets include $2.6 million added to help decrease the number of children on the wait list, Gerber-Winn said.\n\nThe additional funding will allow the program to increase services to 307 children by June and to 572 by June 2015, Gerber-Winn said. The program also has added seven new positions.\n\nThe funding \u201cwill allow the program to serve 50 percent of the current waiting list,\u201d she said.\n\nBut mothers say time is passing and their children are losing their windows of opportunity.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not fair that our children are not getting the help,\u201d said Olivia Espinoza, who leads a support group, Azul Blue, and has an autistic 8-year-old, Matthew Villalobos, who doesn\u2019t speak and still uses a diaper. \u201cMy son is in the same situation. It\u2019s sad not to have a solution.\u201d\n\nReporter Yesenia Amaro can be reached at yamaro@reviewjournal.com or 702-383-0440.", "article_metadata": {"description": "About 357 children on a wait list for help from the state\u2019s Autism Treatment Assistance Program, which offers therapy to improve communication and behavior.
