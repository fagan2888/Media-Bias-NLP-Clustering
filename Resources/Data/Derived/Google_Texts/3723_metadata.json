You pay a ton of money just to try to stay healthy, and if you get seriously sick or injured, you could still be on the hook for thousands more. Smart shopping can keep your expenses low, and give you more options for good care\u2014if you know what to avoid.\n\nhttp://lifehacker.com/whats-the-diff...\n\nDoing Whatever You Did Last Year\n\nAlways shop around. You may have a great plan already\u2014or, let\u2019s face it, the least bad of your options\u2014but you won\u2019t know that until you see what else is out there.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMany states let you auto-renew a plan bought through the health insurance exchanges, but this isn\u2019t always a good idea. If you got a subsidy for insurance (like 84% of people who enrolled through the exchanges), your subsidy and thus your premium might change for the new year\u2014making it less of a good deal.\n\nThat\u2019s because the subsidies are calculated according to the price of the second-lowest cost Silver plan in your area. That might be a different plan, with a different carrier and a different premium cost, than it was last year. Even if your plan doesn\u2019t raise its rates, the total ecosystem of insurance plans may have changed, and that affects how much you pay for your insurance. (There\u2019s a full analysis of those numbers here.) If your income or other key information has changed, that can also affect your rates. Update your information on the exchange, and then browse the plans to see what\u2019s available to you.\n\nSponsored\n\nIf you get your insurance from an employer that pays part of the cost of your premiums, that\u2019s probably your best bet, but not necessarily. Again, shop around anyway. It\u2019s possible that the subsidy on an exchange plan will create a better deal than what you\u2019re getting from a stingy employer.\n\nAnd finally, find out if your plan is grandfathered. Some old plans don\u2019t have to follow all of the provisions of the Affordable Care Act. You might still have to pay for preventive care, for example, while the rest of us are getting it for free. You can call your insurance company and ask if it\u2019s grandfathered: they\u2019ll know what that word means, and they\u2019re required to tell you.\n\nThinking a High Deductible Plan Is Useless\n\nIf you don\u2019t buy insurance, you\u2019ll have to pay a tax penalty. No biggie, you might say, I paid that last year and it wasn\u2019t so much. Well, the amount is still increasing every year. In 2016, it\u2019ll be 2.5% of your income or the average price of a Bronze plan or $695 per adult or $2,065 total\u2014whichever is more. Since the penalty costs about as much as a cheap plan, you might as well buy insurance and get the benefits that come with it, even if it\u2019s a high deductible plan.\n\nIf you think a high deductible is the same as paying out of pocket, think again. With car insurance, you\u2019d be right: the deductible is the amount of money you have to pay out of pocket before your insurance kicks in. Health insurance uses that same word, but it means something a little different. You can rack up plenty of hypothetical charges that don\u2019t dent your deductible at all.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor example, anything on the government\u2019s list of essential health benefits is free to you, without touching your deductible. This is a massive amount of stuff, and includes almost every type of preventive care you can think of. It includes cholesterol screening, depression screening, and testing for sexually transmitted infections if you\u2019re in a high risk demographic. It includes all the recommended vaccines for adults and children. For women it includes birth control of many kinds, including IUDs. It includes breastfeeding support and supplies. It includes all the routine assessments that happen at well-child visits.\n\nhttp://vitals.lifehacker.com/how-to-get-bir...\n\nBasically, if you\u2019re healthy and only visit the doctor for screenings and preventive care, almost everything is covered at no charge, even on those high deductible plans. The only catch is that you have to use your insurance plan\u2019s network, and for some of these benefits you have to meet certain requirements (for example, you have to be over 50 to get free colorectal cancer screening, and you have to be a baby to get the developmental screening for babies.)\n\nEven when something does take a bite out of your deductible, you\u2019re better off having the provider send the bill to your insurance anyway, before sending it to you. That\u2019s because insurance companies can usually get a provider to knock off part of the bill. These savings can be substantial. I got a bill once that said my knee surgery cost about $42,000, but that they made most of that disappear so my insurance company and I would, together, owe roughly $2,000 for the surgery. If I had no insurance, I would have gotten a bill for the original amount and never would have guessed that I could negotiate it down that far.\n\nNot Taking Advantage of Health Savings Accounts\n\nTo be clear: high deductibles suck. They represent one side of a tradeoff, though: high deductibles come with lower premiums (monthly payments) and vice-versa. In some cases, a high deductible plan might actually make more sense than one with a lower deductible.\n\nFor a this kind of plan to be a smart option, you should have enough in your emergency fund to cover the deductible. There\u2019s a special type of account meant for exactly this purpose: the Health Savings Account (HSA). Since your premiums are lower with a high deductible plan, you can (hopefully) afford to put a few hundred dollars a month into the HSA. Then when you get hit with medical bills, you can pay them with that sweet, sweet tax-free money.\n\nhttp://lifehacker.com/5860805/what-i...\n\nUnlike the similar-sounding FSA, the money you put into an HSA is yours forever. You can use it next year, you can withdraw it tax-free when you retire, and you can take it with you when you change jobs. (You can even withdraw from it for non-medical expenses, but you\u2019ll pay a tax penalty when you do.)\n\nThe downside is that sometimes expenses might hit when your HSA is running low. For example, if you open an HSA today but break your leg tomorrow, you won\u2019t have enough money in the account to pay all of your costs. If you had a high premium plan, you would be in better shape. So HSAs make high-deductible plans bearable, but to find out if a particular high-deductible plan is right for you, you\u2019ll have to do the math yourself, and consider how much risk you\u2019re comfortable with.\n\nNot Checking Who Is in-Network\n\nSome plans save money by having a very small network. This may be a tradeoff you have to make to get an affordable plan, but you\u2019ll want to make sure your current providers are in-network.\n\nCheck what specialists are available, too. A study published in JAMA Dermatology found that many of the dermatologists listed in narrow networks\u2019 directories were unavailable: either dead, retired, not reachable by the phone number in the directory, or booked solid for months. Another study in JAMA Internal Medicine found similar results for other specialties. So if you think you might need a specialist\u2019s care in the coming year, don\u2019t just rely on a listing in the plan\u2019s directory: Actually call a few and make sure they are able to accept you as a patient.\n\nhttp://lifehacker.com/5959213/how-ca...\n\nEven if your favorite providers are in-network, there is another potential problem. It\u2019s not just doctors that can be in or out of network, but facilities too. If your doctor does surgeries at two different hospitals in town, it\u2019s possible that one location is covered and the other is not.\n\nIt\u2019s also possible to be treated by an in-network doctor at an in-network hospital, but still have other people involved\u2014say, an anesthesiologist\u2014who are out-of-network. Before you have a procedure done, it\u2019s a good idea to ask if everybody involved will be in-network. Although you can\u2019t solve this problem while shopping for insurance, it\u2019s good to be aware of this downside of narrow networks.\n\nWhat you can look at when shopping is the out-of-pocket maximum. The law mandates a maximum of $6,850 for an individual or $13,700 for a family, but that only applies when you stay in your network. Outside the network, caps can be horrifically high\u2014$50,000 for a family isn\u2019t out of the question. And many plans have no out-of-network cap at all.\n\nGoing It Alone\n\nYou\u2019re not alone when you\u2019re shopping for insurance. On the exchanges, you can get free, local help, either through healthcare.gov or your state\u2019s equivalent.\n\nYou can also comparison shop through a web broker like HoneyInsured or HealthSherpa. Most brokers only require a few bits of information for you to get started comparison shopping. We like that HoneyInsured asks how much risk you\u2019re willing to take on (to decide between high and low deductible plans) and their predictions of how much you\u2019re likely to spend if you have a large medical expense. They also recommend one plan over the others based on what you\u2019ve said your expenses are likely to be, and plot out premiums and deductibles on a graph like the one above. HoneyInsured only operates in a few states, though. You can find a full list of authorized web brokers here.\n\nHowever you shop for insurance, make sure you\u2019re considering all your options, and calculating the tradeoffs. The variety of plans and the huge amounts of money you\u2019re dealing with can make it hard to think straight, but avoiding these traps could help you make some smart decisions.\n\nIllustration by Sam Wooley.\n\nVitals is a blog from Lifehacker all about health and fitness.
