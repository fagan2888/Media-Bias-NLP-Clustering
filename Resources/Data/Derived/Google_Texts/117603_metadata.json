This allows the financial adviser\u2019s millionaire clients to save between $4,600 and $8,800 in annual premium payments\u2014with taxpayers covering those amounts.\n\nCNBC also reported that wealthy individuals with taxable incomes low enough to meet another Obamacare subsidy threshold are qualified to receive tax credits to help cover copayments, co-insurance, and deductibles.\n\nEd Haislmaier, a senior research fellow in health policy at The Heritage Foundation, told The Daily Signal:\n\nEssentially, what you\u2019ve got is a system where the government is handing out an income support benefit without determining whether or not somebody has assets. If a person has significant assets, they don\u2019t really need income support, because they can tap their assets if they need more money to cover their expenses.\n\nAll of McClanahan\u2019s clients retired before turning 65, meaning they no longer receive health insurance through their employers but are not yet eligible for Medicare.\n\nAlthough each client\u2019s net worth was in the millions because of investments and real estate, CNBC reported, their taxable incomes were low enough after retirement for them to qualify for the tax credits.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not so much a loophole as it is a logical consequence of the design, which is really more of a welfare benefit design than a health care design,\u201d Haislmaier said.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the case solely for Obamacare\u2019s subsidized exchange coverage; Medicaid has a similar workaround.\n\nHaislmaier pointed out that the Affordable Care Act also removed asset tests from Medicaid\u2019s eligibility requirements, except for long-term care benefits.\n\nThis means states that have adopted the Medicaid expansion, which was intended for poor individuals, now may enroll wealthy individuals who have low incomes. Haislmaier said:\n\nThat creates a number of interesting interactions, where somebody can have, for example, significant assets but low income and therefore qualify for tax credits or Medicaid if they\u2019re in the right income range and their states adopted the Medicaid expansion.\n\nA major reason for these effects, he said, is that the Affordable Care Act was set up as an income-related welfare benefit and tied to the tax code.\n\n\u201cBasically, the people who designed the ACA were a subset of liberals who were focused on issues of income to the exclusion of other considerations,\u201d Haislmaier said. \u201cSo this functions in the way it was designed and written.\u201d\n\nThe only way to fix the problem, he said, is to overhaul the law and redesign it so that assets are accounted for.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Eligibility for tax credits under the Affordable Care Act is determined by income, not net worth, so a person 's assets aren\u2019t taken into account.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Eligibility for tax credits under the Affordable Care Act is determined by income, not net worth, so a person 's assets aren\u2019t taken into account.", "title": "Why Millionaires Get Obamacare Tax Credits", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/160131_ObamaHealth.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-01-31T21:18:00+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1RPMITt"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Eligibility for tax credits under the Affordable Care Act is determined by income, not net worth, so a person 's assets aren\u2019t taken into account.", "creator": "@dailysignal", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/160131_ObamaHealth.jpg"}, "title": "Why Millionaires Get Obamacare Tax Credits", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Health Care", "tag": "obamacare", "published_time": "2016-01-29T12:52:26+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-01-31T21:18:00+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Obamacare, Affordable Care Act, Carolyn McClanahan, tax credits, health care, Medicaid, Medicare, millionaires, subsidies, wealthy"}, "article_summary": "Millionaires are qualifying for Obamacare subsidies meant to assist low-income Americans who are unable to afford health care, thanks to a flaw in the law.\nBecause eligibility for Obamacare tax credits is determined by income, not net worth, assets aren\u2019t taken into account.\nCNBC also reported that wealthy individuals with taxable incomes low enough to meet another Obamacare subsidy threshold are qualified to receive tax credits to help cover copayments, co-insurance, and deductibles.\nThis means states that have adopted the Medicaid expansion, which was intended for poor individuals, now may enroll wealthy individuals who have low incomes.\nAlthough each client\u2019s net worth was in the millions because of investments and real estate, CNBC reported, their taxable incomes were low enough after retirement for them to qualify for the tax credits."}
