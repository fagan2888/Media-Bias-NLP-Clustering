A freighter collided with one of Germany's longest railway bridges last night, cutting it in two.

German state railway officials say the drawbridge crossing the Ems river at Weener is so badly damaged it cannot be repaired and a new bridge will take years to build.

Passengers travelling the route from Germany to the Netherlands are now forced to take a detour by bus.

The cause of the collision is not known, and no one was injured.
