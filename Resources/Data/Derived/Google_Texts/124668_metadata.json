Gently moving them away from each other, Dr. John Meara showed the distance between Violet Pietrok\u2019s eyes at birth. He slid the sockets closer to demonstrate their positions 19 months later, after he had operated on her.\n\nViolet, now nearly 2, was born with a rare defect called a Tessier facial cleft. Her dark brown eyes were set so far apart, her mother says, that her vision was more like a bird of prey\u2019s than a person\u2019s. A large growth bloomed over her left eye. She had no cartilage in her nose. The bones that normally join to form the fetal face had not fused properly.\n\nHer parents, Alicia Taylor and Matt Pietrok, sought out Meara at Boston Children\u2019s Hospital, thousands of miles from their home in Oregon, because the plastic surgeon had performed four similar operations in the previous three years.\n\nBefore he operated on Violet, Meara wanted a more precise understanding of her bone structure than he could get from an image on a screen. So he asked his colleague Dr. Peter Weinstock to print him a three-dimensional model of Violet\u2019s skull, based on MRI pictures.\n\nThat first model helped him to decide what might need to be done and to discuss his treatment plan with her family. Three more 3-D printouts closer to the operation allowed Meara to rotate the model skull in directions he could not manage with a picture and would not attempt with a patient on the operating table.\n\nSuch 3-D-printed models are transforming medical care, giving surgeons new perspectives and opportunities to practice, and patients and their families a deeper understanding of complex procedures. Hospitals are also printing training tools and personalized surgical equipment. Someday, doctors hope to print replacement body parts.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that 3-D printing is going to be disruptive medicine,\u201d said Dr. Frank Rybicki, the director of the applied imaging science lab at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital, a few blocks from Boston Children\u2019s.\n\n\u201cIt makes procedures shorter, it improves your accuracy,\u201d said Rybicki, a radiologist who uses 3-D printing in his work with face transplants.\n\nThe printer extrudes a layer of liquid plastic instead of ink. It adds a second layer, and then another, and a skull or rib cage \u2014 or whatever the surgeon dials up \u2014 slowly emerges.\n\nThe same process can also print layers of human cells. So far, researchers have also printed blood vessels, simple organs and bits of bone. A Utah boy\u2019s life was saved last year by a 3-D-printed plastic splint that propped open his windpipe.\n\nWeinstock, the director of the Pediatric Simulator Program at Boston Children\u2019s, sees 3-D models as part of a larger program to improve surgical craft. At Children\u2019s and a dozen other pediatric centers around the world, he says, the surgical simulation program he developed improves team communication and trust, and lifts confidence before extremely complex operations. He believes it also shortens patients\u2019 time under anesthesia.\n\nThe models of Violet\u2019s unusual skull allowed Meara to anticipate exactly what he would find underneath her face.\n\nExperimenting with a model he had cut up, Meara noticed that in their ideal positions, the bones of the eye sockets would bump into each other, limiting Violet\u2019s vision. He modified his cuts to avoid that collision.\n\n\u201cThe ability to physically move those segments is huge,\u201d Meara said. \u201cOtherwise, you\u2019re doing it for the first time in the operating room.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://health.heraldtribune.com/files/2015/02/hfparts03.jpg"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}}, "article_summary": "\u201cIt makes procedures shorter, it improves your accuracy,\u201d said Rybicki, a radiologist who uses 3-D printing in his work with face transplants.\nSo he asked his colleague Dr. Peter Weinstock to print him a three-dimensional model of Violet\u2019s skull, based on MRI pictures.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that 3-D printing is going to be disruptive medicine,\u201d said Dr. Frank Rybicki, the director of the applied imaging science lab at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital, a few blocks from Boston Children\u2019s.\nThe models of Violet\u2019s unusual skull allowed Meara to anticipate exactly what he would find underneath her face.\nWeinstock, the director of the Pediatric Simulator Program at Boston Children\u2019s, sees 3-D models as part of a larger program to improve surgical craft."}
