That\u2019s something the actor Charlton Heston and Laurence Tribe, the Harvard constitutional scholar, figured out \u2013 sort of.\n\nBut first, a little background.\n\nTribe, the liberal legal expert who spoke with editors of The Fiscal Times this week about his new book, Uncertain Justice: The Roberts Court and the Constitution, includes a chapter about gun rights.\n\nRelated: Gun Control \u2013 A New Look at the Second Amendment\n\nIn the 2008 landmark 5-4 Supreme Court decision, District of Columbia v. Heller, the court held that the Second Amendment protects an individual\u2019s right to possess a firearm unconnected with service in a militia, and to use that arm for traditionally lawful purposes (such as self-defense within the home) against federal regulation \u2013 something not clearly articulated before.\n\nTwo years after that ruling, SCOTUS \u201cextended that newly recognized right to armed self-defense,\u201d says Tribe in his book, \u201cinto a shield against state and local gun laws,\u201d in its ruling in McDonald v. Chicago.\n\nBack in 2000, however, Tribe received a phone call from the Oscar-winning actor, then president of the National Rifle Association.\n\nTribe had just released a startling statement in the third edition of his treatise on constitutional law, surprising his liberal friends on this issue, he told The Fiscal Times. \u201cI included a very, very, very long footnote about why I thought the Second Amendment was not limited to state militias, even though there\u2019s that preamble [in the amendment], but that it does to some extent protect personal rights.\u201d\n\nRelated: Gun Culture Puts Target and Other Chains in the Line of Fire\n\nTribe described the reaction that followed: \u201cThere was a front page story in The New York Times saying that a leading liberal scholar said the Second Amendment protects gun owners.\u201d\n\nEnter Heston.\n\n\u201cI got a call immediately from Charlton Heston,\u201d said Tribe. \u201cHe called me up and said, \u2018Professor Tribe, I think we have a lot in common here\u2019 \u2013 he was then the president of the NRA \u2013 \u2018and I have a private plane waiting at Logan and an island that I would like to take you to. And we can discuss all of these things over some margaritas or whatever.\u201d\n\nDramatic pause on Tribe\u2019s part \u2013 but the private plane (or the booze) had nothing to do with it. \u201cI said right away, \u2018Whoa, Mr. Heston. I\u2019m a great admirer of yours and I loved Planet of the Apes,\u2019\u201d he recounted on Tuesday. \u201c\u2018But I don\u2019t think we\u2019re on the same page here. I\u2019m in favor of strong gun safety regulations and rules that I think are consistent with the Second Amendment.\u2019\u201d\n\nAt that, Heston abruptly hung up. \u201cAnd I never heard from him again,\u201d said Tribe.\n\nRelated: Bloomberg Tries to Beat the Powerful NRA at Its Own Game\n\nSo no margaritas? \u201cNo margaritas,\u201d said Tribe.\n\nNo island? \u201cNo island, no private plane,\u201d said Tribe. (And no more Heston, alas \u2013 he passed away in 2005.)\n\nIs the squabble between these two men really surprising? \u201cGuns divide the American people,\u201d Tribe writes in his book. \u201cFor decades, we have struggled to fashion laws that balance safety against a rich tradition of gun ownership\u2026 The mere mention of guns often incites hot-tempered debate and more talking than listening among otherwise reasonable people.\u201d\n\nThe Second Amendment isn\u2019t really the culprit, maintains Tribe. \u201cThe First Amendment is much more responsible in a way for the problems of gun violence in America than the Second Amendment. Not that I would get rid of either \u2013 but I certainly wouldn\u2019t get rid of the First Amendment. \u201d he said on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cThe ability of groups like the National Rifle Association, for example, to persuade people to make it a voting issue \u2013 that accounts for the difficulty that Congress has had in passing even the most minimal kinds of gun regulations that would clearly pass muster under the Second Amendment, as interpreted by the Supreme Court.\u201d\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "When having people over to dinner, it\u2019s best not to discuss politics, religion \u2013 or gu", "title": "Heston, Guns and Booze: A Harvard Law Professor\u2019s Strange Tale", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/07/10/Heston-Guns-and-Booze-Harvard-Law-Professor-s-Strange-Tale", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/01282013_Gun_Store_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/07/10/Heston-Guns-and-Booze-Harvard-Law-Professor-s-Strange-Tale", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/01282013_Gun_Store_article.jpg", "title": "The Fiscal Times", "card": "summary", "creator": "@maurmack"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "When having people over to dinner, it\u2019s best not to discuss politics, religion \u2013 or gu", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd7df1\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThe First Amendment is much more responsible in a way for the problems of gun violence in America than the Second Amendment.\nAnd we can discuss all of these things over some margaritas or whatever.\u201dDramatic pause on Tribe\u2019s part \u2013 but the private plane (or the booze) had nothing to do with it.\nThat\u2019s something the actor Charlton Heston and Laurence Tribe, the Harvard constitutional scholar, figured out \u2013 sort of.\n\u201cNo island, no private plane,\u201d said Tribe.\nI\u2019m in favor of strong gun safety regulations and rules that I think are consistent with the Second Amendment.\u2019\u201dAt that, Heston abruptly hung up."}
