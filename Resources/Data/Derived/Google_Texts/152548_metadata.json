Al Sharpton\u2019s National Action Network Convention in Manhattan. \u201cThis is such a clear-cut case that I believe it\u2019s going to give law enforcement in this country an opportunity to really tell us where they are in this controversy.\u201d\n\nA white police officer in North Charleston, S.C., was charged with murder on Tuesday after a video surfaced showing him shooting in the back and killing Scott while he ran away. The officer, Michael Slager, said he had feared for his life because the man had taken his stun gun in a scuffle. A video, however, shows the officer firing eight times as Scott fled. The shooting came less than a year after the high-profile deaths of black men in Staten Island and Ferguson, Mo., in police custody.\n\nMr. Carson, a rising star in conservative circles, said law enforcement will have an opportunity to \u201cdemonstrate which side they come down on,\u201d sounding almost like the Democrats he reviles. But he made sure to imply that he believes blacks clashing with law enforcement can also be blamed for tragic outcomes.\n\n\u201cI also think that we in the African-American community have to make sure that we also recognize that sometimes there\u2019s fault on our side. Sometimes we have people who don\u2019t obey the law, don\u2019t do lawful things and are thugs,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Carson is not the first bombastic conservative to speak at Mr. Sharpton\u2019s annual convention. Past attendees include Newt Gingrich, the former Republican House speaker, and Mr. Sharpton, a Democrat, said he respected Mr. Carson despite their differences. Another African-American Republican, Rev. A.R. Bernard, helped introduce Mr. Carson.\n\nDespite his controversial rhetoric\u2013Mr. Carson once compared Obamacare to slavery and gay marriage to bestiality\u2013he received several warm ovations from the crowd at the Sheraton Hotel in Midtown. Mr. Sharpton said inviting Mr. Carson was an effort to expose his followers to other viewpoints. He said Mr. Carson wasn\u2019t a \u201cphony.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have become so animated with polarized sides that we lost the ability to disagree but have a dialogue,\u201d Mr. Sharpton said before Mr. Carson spoke.\n\nAfter Mr. Carson addressed the convention, touching on topics like his hardscrabble upbringing in Detroit, his faith, and his celebrated career in neurosurgery, Mr. Sharpton, with a smile, said Mr. Carson still can\u2019t have his endorsement.\n\n\u201cYou may not be my choice for president, but if I need surgery, you\u2019re my man,\u201d Mr. Sharpton said.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.byline_name": "Ross Barkan", "sailthru.author": "Ross Barkan", "application-name": "Observer", "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://nyoobserver.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/464494604.jpg?quality=80&w=640"}, "site": "@observer", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@Observer"}, "sailthru.article.image.header": "https://nyoobserver.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/464494604.jpg?quality=80&w=728&h=418&crop=1", "sailthru.tags": "2016, Al Sharpton, Ben Carson, South Carolina, Walter Scott, obsNews & Politics, obsPolitics", "sailthru.section": "News & Politics", "keywords": "walter scott, south carolina, michael slager, ben carson, al sharpton, national action network, 2016, ben carson for president, nan", "sailthru.article.image.grid": "https://nyoobserver.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/464494604.jpg?quality=80&w=300&h=225&crop=1", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://observer.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/dac0f3722a48a53be75eb06c0c4f5119?s=16", "news_keywords": "walter scott, south carolina, michael slager, ben carson, al sharpton, national action network, 2016, ben carson for president, NAN", "generator": "WordPress.com", "msapplication-TileColor": "#2b5797", "sailthru.title": "Ben Carson Says He Watched Walter Scott Shooting With \u2018Horror\u2019", "sailthru.byline_email": "rbarkan@observer.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "sailthru.byline_slug": "ross", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://nyoobserver.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/464494604.jpg?quality=80&w=50", "description": "Ben Carson said today that the Walter Scott shooting in South Carolina filled him with horror.", "sailthru.byline_avatar_url": "https://nyoobserver.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/ross-barkan-headshot-e1402611381985.jpg?quality=80&w=132", "msapplication-tooltip": "News, Politics, Culture, Art, Style, Real Estate, Movie Reviews, TV recaps", "fb": {"app_id": 132947390197809}, "sailthru.byline_twitter": "@rossbarkan", "msapplication-TileImage": "//s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/newyorkobserver-2014/images/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "msvalidate.01": "F8C89E25D5233224541B1BB9B10BF573", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/newyorkobserver", "published_time": "2015-04-08T21:29:58+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-04-08T21:40:21+00:00", "author": "http://observer.com/author/ross"}, "sailthru.description": "Ben Carson said today that the Walter Scott shooting in South Carolina filled him with horror.", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "og": {"site_name": "Observer", "description": "Ben Carson said today that the Walter Scott shooting in South Carolina filled him with horror.", "title": "Ben Carson Says He Watched Walter Scott Shooting With \u2018Horror\u2019", "url": "http://observer.com/2015/04/ben-carson-says-he-watched-walter-scott-shooting-with-horror/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "https://nyoobserver.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/464494604.jpg?quality=80&w=1200", "height": 800}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "146b7f62998343012fae89709f3a8167"}, "sailthru.byline_bio": "Ross Barkan is a national political reporter for The New York Observer.
