AUSTIN (AP) — A Texas judge has formally halted steep Medicaid cuts after ruling that thousands of poor and disabled children would likely lose critical access to therapists.

State District Judge Tim Sulak on Friday issued a temporary injunction that blocks the state from cutting $350 million in Medicaid funding starting next week. State health officials are expected to appeal.

The cuts passed by the Republican-controlled Legislature have drawn increasing bipartisan concern as doctors and families have called attention to the looming impact. Opponents say roughly 60,000 kids across Texas would lose access to speech and occupational therapists.

Sulak called figures the state used to justify the cuts “seriously flawed” and proposed new rates arbitrary.

A spokesman for the Health and Human Services Commission did not immediately return a message seeking comment.
