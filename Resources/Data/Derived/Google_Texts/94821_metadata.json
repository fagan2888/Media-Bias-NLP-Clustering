He said other countries are not responding fast enough while children are orphaned and infected doctors and nurses are lost to the disease.\n\nAlpha Conde of Guinea said the region\u2019s countries are in \u201ca very fragile situation.\u201d\n\nEbola is \u201can international threat and deserves an international response,\u201d he said, speaking through a translator as he sought money, medicine, equipment and training for health care workers.\n\nTom Frieden, director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said he was reminded of the start of the AIDS epidemic.\n\n\u201cWe have to work now so this is not the next AIDS,\u201d Frieden said.\n\nThe fleet of planes that landed outside the Liberian capital of Monrovia consisted of four MV-22 Ospreys and two KC-130s. The 100 additional Marines bring to just over 300 the total number of American troops in the country, said Maj. Gen. Darryl A. Williams, the commander leading the U.S. response.\n\nWilliams joined the American ambassador to Liberia, Deborah Malac, at the airport to greet the aircraft.\n\nAs vehicles unloaded boxes of equipment wrapped in green-and-black cloth, the Marines formed a line on the tarmac and had their temperatures checked by Liberian health workers.\n\nMeanwhile, British authorities said they would introduce \u201cenhanced\u201d screening of travelers for Ebola at Heathrow and Gatwick airports and Eurostar rail terminals.\n\nPrime Minister David Cameron\u2019s office said passengers arriving from West Africa would be questioned about their travels and contacts. Some people could be given a medical assessment and advice on what to do if they develop symptoms.\n\nAlso Thursday, Liberian police used batons and rattan whips to disperse 100 protesters outside the National Assembly, where lawmakers were debating granting President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf more powers beyond those contained in a state of emergency declared in August. Her handling of the crisis has been criticized as heavy handed and ineffective.\n\nLiberian state radio announced that Senate elections scheduled for next week would be postponed. No new date was given.\n\nThe outbreak has killed more than 3,800 people, according to the latest World Health Organization figures. The vast majority of those deaths have been in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone.\n\nElsewhere, University of Maryland researchers announced that the first study of a possible Ebola vaccine in Africa was underway. Scientists say three health care workers in Mali received the experimental shots developed by the U.S. government.\n\nMali has not had any cases of Ebola, but it borders the outbreak zone. Researchers say early safety tests should be done in Ebola-free countries to avoid complicating factors. If the vaccine appears to be safe, larger trials could be done in the outbreak zone early next year.\n\nThe U.S. military is working to build medical centers in Liberia and may send up to 4,000 soldiers to help with the Ebola crisis. Medical workers and beds for Ebola patients are sorely lacking.\n\nBritish Defense Secretary Michael Fallon said his country would provide more than 750 troops to help build treatment centers and an Ebola \u201ctraining academy\u201d in Sierra Leone. Army medics and helicopters will provide direct support. Britain will also contribute an aviation support ship.\n\nBritish troops are expected to arrive next week in Sierra Leone, where they will join military engineers and planners who have been there for nearly a month helping to construct medical centers.\n\nThe German military, which has already been flying material such as protective clothing from Senegal to the worst-hit countries, planned to start a wider deployment of aid in mid-November. The military is expected to set up a clinic for 50 patients.\n\nSierra Leone officials finally released a shipping container filled with medical gear and mattresses that had been held up at the port for more than a month.\n\nIbrahim Bangura, an official who handles medical supplies, said the container\u2019s contents were finally in his possession on Thursday. Bureaucracy and political infighting were blamed for delay in distributing the aid.\n\nIn Guinea, where the first Ebola cases were confirmed back in March, Doctors Without Borders warned on Thursday of a \u201cmassive\u201d influx of cases in the capital.\n\nThe aid group\u2019s center in Conakry received 22 patients on Monday alone, including 18 from the same region 50 kilometers east of the city, the group said, adding that its facilities were reaching their limits.\n\nA Uganda-born doctor, John Taban Dada, died Thursday of Ebola at a treatment center on the outskirts of Monrovia. His death brings to four the number of doctors who have died in Liberia since the outbreak. More than 90 health workers, including nurses and physician assistants, have also died.\n\nThere was continued concern about Ebola in Spain, where the first person known to have caught the disease outside the outbreak zone in West Africa became sick.\n\nThe condition of Spanish nursing assistant Teresa Romero deteriorated on Thursday, said Yolanda Fuentes, deputy director of Madrid\u2019s Carlos III hospital.\n\nFour doctors, four nurses, a hospital orderly and two beauty salon workers who came into contact with Romero have been admitted to the hospital, bringing to 14 the number of people being monitored at the center, health officials said late Thursday.\n\nIn Germany, a man infected in Liberia arrived Thursday at a hospital for treatment - the third Ebola patient to be flown to the country. The St. Georg Hospital in Leipzig said the patient works for the United Nations in Liberia.\n\n___\n\nGiles reported from Madrid.
