They demanded in their \u201ccall and answer\u201d style performance that Vermont\u2019s Democratic Speaker of the House, Shad Smith, hold a public hearing on single-payer by January 29.\n\nSmith declined to comply with their request.\n\nThe Free Press reported that the protesters maintained their occupation of the State Legislature for eight hours. Then, \u201cshortly after 8 p.m. Thursday\u201d:\n\nPolice arrested 29 demonstrators on charges of unlawful trespass . . . when they refused numerous requests to leave the Statehouse. Nine of them also face charges of resisting arrest, state police said. Some walked out voluntarily with law enforcement officers. Others insisted that they be dragged out by state troopers and Washington County Deputy Sheriffs. At least one continued singing protest songs as police dragged him out. another criticized police, saying he was not resisting arrest. \u201cYou\u2019re hurting me! You\u2019re hurting me!\u201d another woman screamed as police carried her from the room by her arms after she refused to stand and walk out on her own.\n\nAccording to its 2012 990 document filed with the Internal Revenue Service, the Vermont Workers\u2019 Center is a 501(c)(3) non-profit that received $635,000 in grants and contributions that year. According to an earlier report from the Free Press, $327,000 of that amount came from grants and $122,000 came from union contributions. 10% of the grants\u2013$30,000\u2013came from the Washington, D.C.-based Jobs with Justice Education Fund, according to that organization\u2019s 2012 990 document filed with the Internal Revenue Service.\n\nPublic records shown on the website of the Open Society Foundations, a George Soros-financed entity, indicate that in 2010 the group donated $150,000 to the Jobs with Justice Education Fund. The website describes the purpose of the grant:\n\nTo support the Jobs with Justice Education Fund (JWJEF), a Washington, DC-based national network of 47 coalitions in 25 states comprised of both member organizations and over 100,000 individual activists that engage workers and allies in campaigns to win justice in workplaces and in communities where working families live. Since its founding in 1987, JWJEF has built a base of diverse constituencies at the local level and provided training, coordination, and networking at the national level to more effectively advance economic and social justice.\n\nSeveral Democratic state legislators who support single-payer said the protesters hurt their cause.\n\n\u201cYou are not doing the cause (my cause) a favor,\u201d State Representative Carolyn Partidge (D-Windham) wrote on a piece of paper, which she \u201cheld . . . up to the demonstrators to no avail.\u201d\n\nLater, Partridge told the Free Press, \u201cI have not lost faith [in single-payer]. I have not lost hope. But the protesters need to know they did not help their cause. . . One loses votes as a result of this.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think they did their cause any good,\u201d Representative Jim Condon, (D-Colchester) told the Free Press.\n\nEven a state representative from the far left Progressive Party criticized the protesters.\n\nThe protesters \u201cruffled a lot of feathers and [have] not helped their immediate cause,\u201d State Representative Chris Pearson (Progressive-Burlington) told the Free Press.\n\nAll 29 of the arrested protesters have a February 26 court date.
