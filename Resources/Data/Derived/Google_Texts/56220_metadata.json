Bannon, Carson was asked whether he believes Muslims who are \"Sharia adherent\" can also participate in a Democratic society governed by the rule of law.\n\n\"Only if they're schizophrenic,\" Carson said. \"I don't see how they can do it otherwise, because they have two different philosophies boring at you [that contradict each other]. That would be very difficult.\"\n\nCarson also argued political correctness will leave Americans vulnerable to ISIS threats.\n\n\"We would be so busy trying to protect their rights that we wouldn't be watching our own,\" he said. \"When I say things like that, people say 'Oh you're Islamophobic.' No, it's not Islamophobic at all... There's a difference between Muslims who accept America and accept our Constitution and accept our ways and those who want to continue a different method of living. And if we're not sophisticated enough to understand that we will lose that war.\"", "article_metadata": {"description": "The neurosurgeon has previously invoked the mental disorder as an insult.", "sailthru.expire_date": "2016-02-17 12:53:47 -0500", "og": {"site_name": "The Huffington Post", "description": "The neurosurgeon has previously invoked the mental disorder as an insult.", "title": "Ben Carson: Muslims Only Embrace American Democracy 'If They're Schizophrenic'", "url": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ben-carson-muslims-schizophrenic_us_56c35c6ae4b0b40245c80190", "image": "http://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/2000_1000/56c35f9d1d00002700df60d0.jpeg?cache=czs4rqjgqc", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The neurosurgeon has previously invoked the mental disorder as an insult.", "creator": "@molliereilly", "image": {"width": 2000, "identifier": "http://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/2000_1000/56c35f9d1d00002700df60d0.jpeg?cache=czs4rqjgqc", "height": 1000}, "title": "Ben Carson: Muslims Only Embrace American Democracy 'If They're Schizophrenic'", "site": "@HuffPostPol", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2016-02-16 12:53:47 -0500", "al": {"ios": {"url": "huffpostnews:///?editionID=us&entryID=us_56c35c6ae4b0b40245c80190", "app_store_id": 306621789, "app_name": "The Huffington Post"}}, "taboola.category": "politics", "fb": {"app_id": 46744042133}, "keywords": "ben carson,muslims", "article": {"section": "Politics", "tag": "ben carson,muslims", "published_time": "2016-02-16 12:53:47 -0500", "modified_time": "2016-02-16 14:39:08 -0500", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/mollie.c.reilly"}, "viewport": "width=1000"}, "article_summary": "Neurosurgeon and GOP presidential candidate Ben Carson accused Muslims who both adhere to Islamic law and embrace American values of being \"schizophrenic.\"\nGOP presidential hopeful Ben Carson says he doesn't think it's possible to adhere to Sharia law and accept American values.\nThere's a difference between Muslims who accept America and accept our Constitution and accept our ways and those who want to continue a different method of living.\n\"Only if they're schizophrenic,\" Carson said.\n\"We would be so busy trying to protect their rights that we wouldn't be watching our own,\" he said."}
