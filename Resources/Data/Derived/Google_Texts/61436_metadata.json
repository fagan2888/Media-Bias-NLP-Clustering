She and Gov. Paul LePage, a Republican, regularly have referred to what they described as runaway spending at DHHS and said the agency should prioritize services for the disabled, children and elderly \u2014 not \u201cable-bodied\u201d adults living in poverty.\n\nMayhew described her tenure so far as marked by \u201ctough choices\u201d and said she and LePage have only begun the work of right-sizing DHHS.\n\n\u201cThis administration had to put the brakes on,\u201d she said. \u201cWe set our sights on stabilizing the financial foundation, paying our bills, meeting the needs of our most vulnerable and putting people back to work. \u2026 Put simply, we are infusing Maine\u2019s welfare safety net with integrity, transparency and common sense.\u201d\n\nUnder Mayhew\u2019s watch, the state repaid roughly $750 million in hospital debt and controlled Medicaid spending such that the department predicts zero growth in 2014 and 2015. Mayhew also prioritized performance measures and instituted \u201caccountable care,\u201d which allows health care providers that provide quality service at lower cost to share in state savings.\n\nThe department also established a five-year lifetime limit on the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program, which contributed to a 50 percent decline in TANF enrollment, and implemented Democrat-led efforts to partner the agency with the Department of Labor to offer welfare recipients a clearer path to work.\n\nMayhew said that she has prioritized transparency and accountability, such as the new statewide policy to require photo ID on EBT cards \u2014 a plan decried by opponents as a political tool to raise suspicion about welfare recipients.\n\nStill, MHPC handing its premier award to Mayhew will do little to stem criticism from Democrats and their allies who say Mayhew and LePage\u2019s policy agenda is driven by ideology, not the pursuit of public welfare.\n\nThroughout much of the last Legislature, when Democrats controlled both chambers, Mayhew was second only to LePage himself as the Democrats\u2019 chief political foil.\n\nWhen Riverview Psychiatric Center lost critical federal accreditation \u2014 and funding \u2014 it was Mayhew in the hot seat at the Legislature\u2019s Health and Human Services Committee. Democratic lawmakers regularly criticized what they described as Mayhew\u2019s \u201cmismanagement.\u201d\n\nIt was a position she\u2019d find herself in again and again \u2014 when the state\u2019s Medicaid rides program was plagued with problems, when the department hired a controversial consultant to study welfare (the company ultimately was fired after instances of plagiarism were reported by the media), and when the state Center for Disease Control was embroiled in a document shredding scandal.\n\nMayhew also was a leading voice in the opposition to Medicaid expansion, a key pillar of President Barack Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act. Democrats said the expansion would boost the state\u2019s economy by providing access to needed health care to roughly 70,000 low-income Mainers, funded almost entirely by federal money.\n\nMayhew warned that expansion would cost taxpayers untold millions and needlessly expand the state\u2019s welfare rolls at a time when MaineCare spending already represents nearly one-quarter of all state spending, but the figures she referenced were far out of line with most independent analyses of welfare expansion.\n\nLePage successfully vetoed Democrats\u2019 effort to expand Medicaid five times.\n\nIn a written statement, Maine Democratic Party Chairman Ben Grant said that under Mayhew, DHHS was \u201ca sinking ship.\u201d\n\n\u201cUnder her watch, she\u2019s allowed ongoing chronic mismanagement to go unchecked, resulting in wasted taxpayer dollars,\u201d he said. \u201cDHHS needs accountability, not accolades. This is just another example of blind loyalty from the GOP to reward bad behavior among their own, even at the expense of Maine taxpayers.\u201d\n\nMayhew addressed the criticism she had faced from what she and others at the MHPC luncheon described as a hostile media and stiff political opposition.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s easy to politicize the debate about DHHS reform,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to continue to pretend that you can be all things to all people. It\u2019s much more difficult to acknowledge that tough choices have to be made.\u201d\n\nFollow Mario Moretto on Twitter at @riocarmine.", "article_metadata": {"description": "PORTLAND, Maine \u2014 Mary Mayhew, the controversial commissioner of the Department of Health and Human Services, was honored Tuesday by the state\u2019s pre-eminent conservative think tank, the Maine Heritage Policy Center.
