The new room has a sink and two spaces; each space contains a table, a rocking chair and has a curtain for privacy. It is available to reserve between 8:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. when staff is on campus to unlock the room.\n\nPreviously, employees could reserve a conference room in the HR department to use as a nursing room. The new room, which had been used as a storage room for academic affairs, is 200e in the BA and is the first full-time mother\u2019s room on UVU\u2019s campus. It is for employee use only.\n\n\u201cWe really felt that we needed a dedicated spot for nursing mothers who work on campus (a nicer place),\u201d said Irene Whittier, ADA Coordinator at UVU.\n\nThere are three rooms available for nursing students to reserve \u2013 409K in the Losee Center, 209e in the Liberal Arts building, and 505 in the Computer Science building. Students need to call ahead to reserve a time, because each room doubles as a conference room for staff meetings.\n\nNone of Utah\u2019s laws specifically address nursing students; Utah has two laws that protect a woman\u2019s right to breastfeed in public, but do not require campuses to have a lactation policy. The Student Life and Wellness Center is planning a lactation room strictly for student mothers\u2019 use. They are looking for a space to dedicate.\n\nThe accommodations were made by Mark Weisenberg, UVU associate vice president of human resources, to adhere to federal law \u2013 the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act amended a provision of the Fair Labor Standards Act to require all employers (with over 50 employees) to provide a private place for nursing employees to use. The Utah legislature passed a joint resolution in 2012 that also requires employers to provide a space.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "UVU Review", "description": "Utah Valley University\u2019s Human Resources department has dedicated a room in the Browning Administration building to be used as a mother\u2019s room for nursing employees.
