They were just released from the hospital Friday.\n\nHand in hand. A bond unlike any other. Hands that not only hold four day Macario Doshier, they literally brought him into this world.\n\n\u201cIt was like adrenaline was just rushing through me,\u201d Bryson Doshier said. \u201cI was shocked it was even happening at first.\u201d\n\nDoshier wasn't home when his wife Elizabeth went into labor. Little Macario wasn't supposed to make his debut until another three weeks.\n\n\u201cHe just kind of decided to come early,\u201d Elizabeth said.\n\nElizabeth wasn't really sure if her contractions were real, and called Bryson who was at work. He rushed home and just in time.\n\n\u201cI had just put my son down for bed, and then the contractions just started piling one right onto another,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI come running in and get her moved down to the floor after that, and that\u2019s when her water broke,\u201d Bryson said.\n\nBryson has paramedic training, but never fathomed he'd deliver his own child. He called 911, and EMSA walked him through one life's most precious miracles.\n\n\u201cCan you see any part of the baby now?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want you to listen carefully and do exactly as I say. I want you to lay her on her back in the center of the bed or the floor.\u201d\n\nWith the couples 17 month old son with a friend in another room and help on the way, little Macario was born right in the middle of the living room floor.\n\n\u201cI want you to get some dry towels and a blanket.\u201d\n\nMoments later...\n\n\u201cThe baby is coming out.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo not pull on the baby.\u201d\n\n\u201cCan you see any part of the baby, yet?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes. The whole baby is out.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can hear him. You\u2019re doing a good job.\u201d\n\nHeld by his father's hands for the first time and now soothed by a familiar voice little Macario heard long before his unexpected arrival.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m proud and astonished,\u201d Elizabeth said.\n\nElizabeth too, was delivered by her father at home. Her mother is an EMSA dispatcher, and if Bryson had called just a couple of minutes sooner, grandma would have been the one walking Bryson through the delivery.", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-17", "Description": "An Oklahoma City dad went above and beyond for his family, delivering his own baby boy while being instructed by EMSA paramedics over the phone.", "author": "Joleen Chaney", "og": {"url": "http://www.news9.com/story/31327851/paramedic-walks-metro-dad-through-delivering-son-over-the-phone", "image": "http://KWTV.images.worldnow.com/images/9980171_G.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "An Oklahoma City dad went above and beyond for his family, delivering his own baby boy while being instructed by EMSA paramedics over the phone.", "title": "Paramedic Walks Metro Dad Through Delivering Son Over The Phone"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://KWTV.images.worldnow.com/images/9980171_G.jpg", "description": "An Oklahoma City dad went above and beyond for his family, delivering his own baby boy while being instructed by EMSA paramedics over the phone.", "card": "summary", "title": "Paramedic Walks Metro Dad Through Delivering Son Over The Phone"}, "wnreadableurl": "paramedic-walks-metro-dad-through-delivering-son-over-the-phone", "ROBOTS": "index,follow,noarchive", "owner": "KWTV", "fb": {"app_id": 538140636230283}, "date": "2016/02/26", "KEYWORDS": "oklahoma city,okc,media,news,weather,tv,cbs,local,tornado,storm,oklahoma,newsok,channel 9,channel nine,news 9,television,this morning,live radar,kwtv,sports,video,live streaming,interactive,", "wn-version": "ContainerE-Story", "wn-base": "IIS28", "verify-v1": "d5ZN+GNiazjgWlnr3WHikwraMvFljdUSLMgex4CGnc8=", "news_keywords": "oklahoma city,okc,media,news,weather,tv,cbs,local,tornado,storm,oklahoma,newsok,channel 9,channel nine,news 9,television,this morning,live radar,kwtv,sports,video,live streaming,interactive,"}, "article_summary": "Little Macario wasn't supposed to make his debut until another three weeks.\nElizabeth wasn't really sure if her contractions were real, and called Bryson who was at work.\nYou\u2019re doing a good job.\u201dHeld by his father's hands for the first time and now soothed by a familiar voice little Macario heard long before his unexpected arrival.\nThere was a special delivery for one metro family as a father delivers his son.\n\u201cI was shocked it was even happening at first.\u201dDoshier wasn't home when his wife Elizabeth went into labor."}
