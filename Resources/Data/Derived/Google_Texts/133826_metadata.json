In the now infamous segment, Harris argues \u201cIslam is the mother-lode of bad ideas\u201d and that \u201cWe are misled to think the fundamentalists are the fringe.\u201d\n\nMuslim American academic Reza Aslan was subsequently called on by CNN to comment on Maher\u2019s views, which he demurely dismissed, but what was most interesting was comparing the treatment of Aslan and Affleck, both voices arguing against anti-Muslim prejudice, by mainstream American TV anchors.\n\nIn his interview with CNN, Aslan, a professor of religion, was forced into an apologetic stance in which he sought to elicit a recognition that Muslims are diverse in their outlooks and beliefs, despite being persistently dismissed by both skeptical CNN interviewers.\n\nThe discussion subsequently continued without Aslan, his voice having largely been ignored until that point anyway, but what was telling was that his contribution was recast as a hostile and angry response by a third CNN presenter, Chris Cuomo: \u201cHis tone was angry. He wound up kind of demonstrating what people are fearful about when they think of the faith in the first place, which is the hostility of it.\u201d\n\n\u201cAngry\u201d is just another term used to invalidate someone\u2019s position by attempting to root their arguments in emotion rather than rationality \u2013 it\u2019s what men do to women in the \u201cangry feminist\u201d variation, and it\u2019s what white people do to ethnic minorities (women especially, through the angry black woman stereotype). Cuomo was seeking to delegitimize Aslan\u2019s perspective by making him appear as an extension of the irrational and angry faith the anchors had consistently upheld as the only valid perception of Islam.\n\nCompare this dismissal of Aslan\u2019s polite frustration with the response to Ben Affleck\u2019s visceral anger and disgust at Maher\u2019s original statements. \u201cIt\u2019s gross and racist\u201d Affleck retorted, his annoyance evident. But unlike Aslan, who\u2019s subaltern identity meant he required approval from the anchors in order for his arguments to be given credence, Affleck\u2019s white privilege allowed him to express a similar sentiment to Aslan in far cruder and more assertive terms, yet without being dismissed.\n\nI was reminded in watching the clip of a statement by the activist Audre Lorde: \u201cBlack and Third world people are expected to educate white people as to our humanity.\u201d Discussions involving Muslims begin with the assumption that Muslims must prove their humanity to a hostile audience, the same premise which requires Muslims with no connection to ISIL or violent jihadis to begin a campaign like \u201cNot In My Name\u201d so they can avoid guilt by association.\n\nThe debate has been framed as a discussion over the nature of liberalism but that is, frankly, to give Maher\u2019s bigotry far too much credence. Maher called Islam \u201cthe only religion that acts like the mafia, that will fucking kill you if you say the wrong thing,\u201d a statement which, when deconstructed, is a textbook illustration of bigotry.\n\nFor a start, religions don\u2019t do or think anything \u2013 people articulate ideas or act in the name of religion; Affleck was spot-on when he queried whether Maher had somehow determined the \u201cthe codified doctrine of Islam.\u201d And he was even more accurate when he lambasted Maher\u2019s attempt to play on white victimhood by casting himself, a highly influential TV host, as part of an oppressed group whose voice was somehow being suppressed on issues relating to Islam and Muslims \u2014 all the while demonizing Islam and Muslims, largely unchallenged, on primetime Television.\n\nThis phony martyrdom is a classic example of what the writer Richard Seymour terms \u201cwhite victimhood,\u201d rebranding minorities as aggressors with the fictitious power to mimic the type of systemic discrimination actually experienced by those cast as outsiders. This attempt at \u201cliberal victimhood\u201d ultimately serves \u2014 just like white victimhood serves to undermine anti-racist struggles \u2014 as a way of delegitimizing the very real and enduring struggle against institutional racism and individual prejudice experienced every day by Muslims. \u200e", "article_metadata": {"description": "For all his odes to liberal ideals, Maher's latest effort to demonize Muslims reveals a disturbing, illiberal truth", "title": "Bill Maher\u2019s horrible excuse: Why his defense of Islamophobia just doesn\u2019t make any sense", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "For all his odes to liberal ideals, Maher's latest effort to demonize Muslims reveals a disturbing, illiberal truth", "title": "Bill Maher\u2019s horrible excuse: Why his defense of Islamophobia just doesn\u2019t make any sense", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/10/12/bill_mahers_horrible_excuse_why_his_defense_of_islamophobia_just_doesnt_make_any_sense/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/10/bill_maher4.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "For all his odes to liberal ideals, Maher's latest effort to demonize Muslims reveals a disturbing, illiberal truth", "title": "Bill Maher\u2019s horrible excuse: Why his defense of Islamophobia just doesn\u2019t make any sense", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/10/bill_maher4.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Myriam Francois-Cerrah", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Ben Affleck, Bill Maher, Conservative, Islam, Islamophobia, liberal, Muslim Americans, Muslims, Reza Aslan", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Compare this dismissal of Aslan\u2019s polite frustration with the response to Ben Affleck\u2019s visceral anger and disgust at Maher\u2019s original statements.\nThis phony martyrdom is a classic example of what the writer Richard Seymour terms \u201cwhite victimhood,\u201d rebranding minorities as aggressors with the fictitious power to mimic the type of systemic discrimination actually experienced by those cast as outsiders.\nThe debate has been framed as a discussion over the nature of liberalism but that is, frankly, to give Maher\u2019s bigotry far too much credence.\nThis attempt at \u201cliberal victimhood\u201d ultimately serves \u2014 just like white victimhood serves to undermine anti-racist struggles \u2014 as a way of delegitimizing the very real and enduring struggle against institutional racism and individual prejudice experienced every day by Muslims.\nIn his interview with CNN, Aslan, a professor of religion, was forced into an apologetic stance in which he sought to elicit a recognition that Muslims are diverse in their outlooks and beliefs, despite being persistently dismissed by both skeptical CNN interviewers."}
