After citing some of the toughest challenges his administration has faced, including the Great Recession and the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, Obama said, \u201cNo challenge poses a greater threat to our future than a changing climate.\u201d\n\nRelated: Obama Warns of Costly Public Health Crisis Spurred by Climate Change\n\n\u201cAs one of America\u2019s governors has said, we\u2019re the first generation to feel the impact of climate change, and the last generation that can do something about it,\u201d he said, quoting Washington State governor Jay Inslee. \u201cAnd that\u2019s why I committed the United States to leading the world on this challenge, because I believe there is such a thing as being too late.\u201d\n\nGlobal warming has long been at best a peripheral issue in major presidential and congressional campaigns, and it clearly took a back seat to the economy, immigration reform and a half dozen other issues in the 2012 presidential battle between Obama and former Republican governor Mitt Romney.\n\nNow, as Republicans prepare for their first nationally televised presidential debate in Cleveland on Thursday, the fate of Obama\u2019s new \u201cClean Power\u201d initiative, construction of the proposed Keystone XL pipeline, the plight of the fast-declining coal industry and other environmental issues suddenly are acquiring increased political resonance.\n\nEven before Obama spelled out the details of the new Environmental Protection Agency coal emission rules yesterday, a handful of the top tier Republican presidential candidates including former Florida governor Jeb Bush, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz teed off against the plan over the weekend.\n\nThe GOP presidential candidates took part in a weekend gathering at a posh southern California seaside resort with 450 deep-pocketed Republican donors. The elite event was hosted by David and Charles Koch, major backers of conservative and libertarian candidates and the owners of one of the nation\u2019s largest oil, gas and chemical companies.\n\nRelated: Obama and Critics Battle Over Climate Change Costs\n\nBush described the new EPA rules as \u201cirresponsible and overreaching\u201d during his presentation on Sunday, according to The New York Times. \u201cThe rule runs over state governments, will throw countless people out of work, and increase everyone\u2019s energy prices.\u201d Cruz vowed to block the rule from being implemented if he is elected President, and described it as a \u201cradical attempt to destabilize the nation\u2019s energy system.\u201d\n\nObama and his political allies vowed to push back against the Republicans and industry critics.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve heard these same stale arguments against it before,\u201d Obama said at the White House event. \u201cEvery time America \u2026 sets clear rules and smart standards for our air, our water, our children\u2019s health, we get the same scary stories about killing jobs, businesses and freedom.\u201d\n\nFormer Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, the frontrunner for the Democratic presidential nomination, vowed on Sunday to build on Obama\u2019s new power plant rule if she wins election. She dismissed the opponents as \u201cRepublican doubters and defeatists.\u201d\n\nRelated: Cities Face Costly Projects to Cope with Climate Change\n\nAmericans are alarmed by global warming and repeatedly have indicated in polling they want their leaders to address the consequences of unrestrained carbon emissions. A new poll published on Monday by Quinnipiac University shows that by a margin of 65 percent to 25 percent, American voters agree with Pope Francis that action is needed to address global warming. What\u2019s more, by better than three to one, voters believe that climate change is partially manmade \u2013 something that some Republican lawmakers and conservative analysts still dispute.\n\nAccording to the White House, the effects of climate change are already being felt across the county. Over the past 30 years, for example, the percentage of Americans with asthma has more than doubled, and climate change is increasing Americans\u2019 risk of landing in the hospital with a respiratory and heart problem. Severe droughts and wildfires in California and other western and southwestern states are now a common occurrence amid record heat waves. At the same time, rising sea levels are hammering and degrading coastal communities throughout the country.\n\nYet even among average voters, there is a partisan divide over the specifics of the global warming issue. While the president and many Democrats agree with the Pope that global warming is a moral issue, Republicans by a margin of 77 percent to 18 percent disagree with that assessment. And Republicans are divided 46 percent to 46 percent on the question of whether climate change is caused by human activity. Sen. James Inhofe (R-OK), chair of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, has long argued and written that global warming is a \u201choax.\u201d\n\nThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and most other mainstream scientists long ago concluded that heat-trapping greenhouse gases emitted into the atmosphere by utility plants directly contribute to global warming. Electric power plants generate about 2.2 billion tons of carbon dioxide annually \u2013which amounts to nearly 40 percent of the U.S.\u2019s total annual carbon emissions. The administration\u2019s new rules \u2013 which underwent a major overhaul since first surfacing a year ago \u2013 for the first time attempt to regulate carbon emissions as a pollutant under the Clean Air Act.\n\nRelated: Look Who\u2019s Worried About Global Warming Now\n\nThe new EPA regulations would cut carbon emissions from existing plants by 32 percent below 2005 levels by 2030 and set limits on the amount of carbon pollution that new or modified power plants can release. The plan would also reward states and power plants that move swiftly to increase their investment in alternative energy sources such as solar and wind power.\n\nAmong other features of the final rule, according to the White House:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "President Obama on Monday formally unveiled his signature plan for dramatically reduci", "title": "Obama: This May Be \u2018The Last Generation\u2019 That Can Stop Climate Change", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/08/04/Obama-May-Be-Last-Generation-Can-Stop-Climate-Change", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/05012011_Solar_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/08/04/Obama-May-Be-Last-Generation-Can-Stop-Climate-Change", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/05012011_Solar_article.jpg", "creator": "@ericpianin", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "President Obama on Monday formally unveiled his signature plan for dramatically reduci", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "And Republicans are divided 46 percent to 46 percent on the question of whether climate change is caused by human activity.\nAccording to the White House, the effects of climate change are already being felt across the county.\nWhat\u2019s more, by better than three to one, voters believe that climate change is partially manmade \u2013 something that some Republican lawmakers and conservative analysts still dispute.\nRelated: Obama and Critics Battle Over Climate Change CostsBush described the new EPA rules as \u201cirresponsible and overreaching\u201d during his presentation on Sunday, according to The New York Times.\nYet even among average voters, there is a partisan divide over the specifics of the global warming issue."}
