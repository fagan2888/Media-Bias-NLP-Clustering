The ground search is focusing on the U.S. Highway 69 corridor north and south of Muskogee and routes to Okmulgee.\n\nPolice said since the stretch of road is likely the way the men took to and from Rocklahoma, it's a top search area.\n\nEven though the searching hasn't turned up much, Parrick's mother, Greta Richards, is hopeful.\n\n\"I've been out searching every day, walking the roads, I've searched through the leads, I've searched through pictures, I've done all that I know to do and that's really the only way I can keep my sanity is just to keep doing those things, keep that hope going and I do, I just feel hopeful, I think it will have a good outcome,\" she said.\n\nThe men were last seen driving a silver Pontiac minivan with the Muscogee Creek Nation tag B8E23.\n\nAt 8:30 Saturday night, a vigil will be held for the two men at the Rocklahoma grounds.", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-17", "Description": "Law enforcement and volunteers have gathered at the Creek Nation Casino Saturday to continue the search for two men who have been missing since the Rocklahoma concert.", "author": "Katiera Winfrey", "og": {"url": "http://www.newson6.com/story/29256192/authorities-volunteers-search-for-men-missing-since-rocklahoma", "image": "http://KOTV.images.worldnow.com/images/7995688_G.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Law enforcement and volunteers have gathered at the Creek Nation Casino Saturday to continue the search for two men who have been missing since the Rocklahoma concert.", "title": "Authorities, Volunteers Search For Men Missing Since Rocklahoma"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://KOTV.images.worldnow.com/images/7995688_G.jpg", "description": "Law enforcement and volunteers have gathered at the Creek Nation Casino Saturday to continue the search for two men who have been missing since the Rocklahoma concert.", "card": "summary", "title": "Authorities, Volunteers Search For Men Missing Since Rocklahoma"}, "wnreadableurl": "authorities-volunteers-search-for-men-missing-since-rocklahoma", "ROBOTS": "index,follow,noarchive", "owner": "KOTV", "fb": {"app_id": 497059410331845}, "date": "2015/06/06", "KEYWORDS": "tulsa,media,news,weather,tv,cbs,local,tornado,storm,oklahoma,kotv.com,channel 6,channel six,green country,television,the news on 6,the news on six,six in the morning,live", "wn-version": "ContainerE-Story", "wn-base": "IIS06", "verify-v1": "67+ifqPKEX7ZTB2sopjxTD1c6nx6ScxupNN92EqnIpc=", "news_keywords": "tulsa,media,news,weather,tv,cbs,local,tornado,storm,oklahoma,kotv.com,channel 6,channel six,green country,television,the news on 6,the news on six,six in the morning,live"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0e4a\"", "article_summary": "The search for two men who went missing during Rocklahoma a little more than two weeks ago continued Saturday.\n6/4/2015 Related Story: Dogs Used In Search For Men Missing Since RocklahomaSaturday, even with all the walking and the high temperatures, the search party showed up ready to work.\nPolice said since the stretch of road is likely the way the men took to and from Rocklahoma, it's a top search area.\nThat party was led by law enforcement, but in Mayes County, where the men were last seen, another search party was led by one of the men's parents.\nAt 8:30 Saturday night, a vigil will be held for the two men at the Rocklahoma grounds."}
