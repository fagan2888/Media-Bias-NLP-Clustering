He\u2019s a board member or cofounder of more than 15 companies, a frequent public speaker and author of a new book, Moonshot!: Game-Changing Strategies to Build Billion-Dollar Businesses. Far from resting on the laurels of his success as a brilliant marketing prodigy at the Pepsi-Cola division of PepsiCo, Inc. \u2013 where he conceived of the legendary Pepsi Challenge campaign \u2013 or his tumultuous decade at Apple, during which annual revenues grew ten-fold, Sculley is agitating for change. In Moonshot! he argues that the multiplicative effect of empowered customers, cloud computing, analytics and mobility will upend many of today\u2019s established businesses. At the same time, there\u2019s never been a better time to be an entrepreneur. Among the bets he\u2019s placing is Obi Worldphone, a company that\u2019s building a low-cost smart phone for developing markets. He spoke to SiliconANGLE from his Palm Beach, FL home.\n\nYou\u2019re active on the boards of at least 15 different companies right now. How do you choose which startups should get your time?\n\nLet\u2019s set some context. The incredible growth of technologies like cloud, mobility and analytics has created a huge shift in the market from producers being in control to customers being in control. So the first thing I look for is big problems that can be solved in a better way by taking advantage of this power shift.\n\nMy second criterion is that the opportunity should be cross-domain or derivative of another shift. I have experience in fields like technology, healthcare, finance and consumer packaged goods. Innovation takes place at the edges of these domains as they move together, so I am sometimes able to see something in one domain that might work in another.\n\nI\u2019m also constantly following technology trends and trying to calibrate things that are practical rather than just exciting. I also have the advantage of a network of people I consult to check things out. I don\u2019t have a team out looking for deals. People come to me and my wife, who\u2019s a mathematician and computer scientist, and we decide if we want to get involved. A big part of it is whether I like the people and they like me.\n\nWhat do you mean by the derivative effects of technology? Can you give an example?\n\nCompanies like Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter and Snapchat have created incredible value because of cloud and analytics. I can take advantage of the derivative effect of what they\u2019ve done, which is that cloud computing has been commoditized. I can apply that to established businesses.\n\nFor example, one company I\u2019m involved in is Neft (New England Funding Technologies LLC). It combines the derivative values of both cloud and mobility to enable consumers to improve their credit ratings on the fly by paying off debts from their smart phones. This is an opportunity to literally reconfigure the entire ecosystem of credit financing and solving a big customer problem using a combination of technologies.\n\nHow does \u201ccustomers in control\u201d affect business opportunities?\n\nThe system we have today to pay for medical procedures is unsustainable. All of the incentives are steered to paying for services. As poorly drafted as the Affordable Care Act is, it did change the incentives to pay for outcomes, not just procedures. Now hospitals are reinventing themselves. They\u2019re taking on the risk of keeping patients out of the hospital instead of putting them in. That opens up a big opportunity in virtual care, using video conferencing and wearable devices to dramatically reduce the cost of healthcare delivery and give customers more control over their choices and costs. The only thing the government did was shift policies toward outcomes. Governments don\u2019t innovate, but they can create an atmosphere for innovation.\n\nWhy do you believe Obi Worldphone will work?\n\nThe smart phone industry is eight years old and one company takes all the profits \u2013 Apple. The rest of the industry has totally commoditized. While that\u2019s been devastating to many smart phone companies, it\u2019s actually an attractive entry point to a company that can differentiate with design.\n\nPeople in the developing world can\u2019t afford an $800 smart phone, but the big companies can\u2019t make money at a $150 price point because they have so many expenses. So we\u2019re going directly to the most successful component companies and asking them to work with us to build an affordable smart phone based on commodity components. We\u2019ve brought in people from companies like Apple to create a beautiful design. It turns out it isn\u2019t all that expensive. Basically, we took what is a problem for others and turned it to our advantage.\n\nHow are these new middle-class consumers in emerging economies different from those who came before them?\n\nPeople forget that there was a time when the middle class didn\u2019t exist, so there\u2019s no reason to believe it will develop in other countries the same way it did here. I see a new group of at least one billion people who aspire to the American dream. In many cases they\u2019re highly educated and they work very hard, but their definition of middle class is very different from ours. For example, Millennials in China may live in condominiums with common areas and they share things. They have completely re-conceptualized what a home looks like. They don\u2019t keep score by what they own. My guess is the middle class will be completely redefined, and probably become less consumption-oriented.\n\nYou\u2019re a big fan of having experienced management involved with any startup. Why is that so important?\n\nYou have to be prepared to make mistakes and not get rattled. Take Zeta Interactive [a digital marketing analytics company that Sculley cofounded with long-time business partner David Steinberg]. It\u2019s being proclaimed as one of the most successful cloud marketing companies in the world, but we actually started out recruiting student applicants for about 300 schools. We built the business to $50 million and then Congress decided it wasn\u2019t a good investment to give students loans for for-profit schools. So the industry imploded.\n\nDavid Steinberg knew how to pivot. He didn\u2019t panic. We had to lay off 300 people and raise more capital, but in the space of three years we reinvented the company. Experienced leadership makes a difference.\n\nAre we in another technology bubble?\n\nExponential technologies aren\u2019t a bubble. Over the next five years we\u2019re going to see incredible successes by companies haven\u2019t even started yet. The exit rules will probably change, though. Big companies are constrained from innovating by legacy, but they understand change, and I think they will look for businesses they can acquire to reinvent their companies. I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll see the race to IPO like you used to, however\n\nYou have a knack for seeing around corners. What\u2019s the secret?\n\nHave to have insatiable curiosity and a sense of urgency. Focus on recruiting and retaining incredibly talented people. Guild an organization that moves quickly toward opportunity.\n\nIn 2008 the Fed dropped interest rates to zero. For many big corporations that was a motivation to borrow so they could to buy back their own stock. Today those same companies are scrambling to catch up with Amazon, Google, Salesforce and the other that created new businesses with those dollars. The leadership at those big companies was incented for stock price and not future growth. The leadership of the next five years has to think about things entirely differently.\n\nYou\u2019re at an age when many executives are kicking back and enjoying the fruits of their wealth. When are you going to slow down?\n\nI\u2019m fortunate to have good health and as much energy as I did 20 years ago. I have no intention of stopping what I\u2019m doing. I\u2019m having the time of my life.\n\nPhoto courtesy SculleySpeaks.com", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "SiliconANGLE", "description": "More than a decade the past the typical corporation\u2019s mandatory retirement age, John Sculley\u00a0appears\u00a0busier than ever.
