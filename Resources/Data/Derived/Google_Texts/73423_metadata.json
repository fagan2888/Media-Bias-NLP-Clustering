Can it be recycled?\n\nAnswer: Twine made from polypropylene is unsafe to burn and can get tangled in landfill equipment. Cows and horses can also ingest small pieces which can collect in their stomachs and kill them. Birds often get tangled up in the twine and die.\n\nThe Fort Collins Conservation District started a baling twine recycling program with the goal of removing the danger to domestic animals and wildlife.\n\nA Minnesota company is now sending a semi truck to pick up the twine from three locations in Larimer County: Jax in north Fort Collins, Anderson Ace Hardware in Wellington, and Barnyard Vet Supply in Loveland.\n\nFor more information go to ftcollinscd.org or call 970-221-0611.\n\nQuestion: Can I recycle laminated paper?\n\nAnswer: The laminating film is not recyclable. When paper goes through the recycling process it is shredded and the plastic lamination is not always removed. It then becomes a contaminant. If you can easily remove the laminating sheet from the paper then the paper can be recycled. Again, the better items are prepared for recycling, the less contamination and waste occurs.\n\nPatty Packrat looks forward to receiving and answering questions from readers.
