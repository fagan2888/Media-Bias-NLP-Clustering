Her name\u2019s \u2018Thumper,\u2019\u201d says pilot Mark Harris, as he revs the engine of the tiny 1957 Cessna 182. \u201cClear prop!\u201d\n\n\u201cAfter the bad news, but before death, there\u2019s a lot to be done.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a 30 minute flight from our starting point in Eureka to the Hoopa Valley Native American reservation where Dr. Fratkin\u2019s going to visit a man named Paul James. He\u2019s dying of liver cancer.\n\n\u201cA good number of patients in my practice are cared for in communities that have no access to hospice services,\u201d Fratkin says, shouting over the voices on the plane\u2019s intercom.\n\nFratkin is a palliative medicine physician. He\u2019s the guy who comes in when the cancer doctors first deliver a serious diagnosis.\n\n\u201cAfter the bad news, but before death, there\u2019s a lot to be done,\u201d he likes to say.\n\nHe manages medications to control symptoms like pain, nausea, breathlessness, but he also helps manage peoples\u2019 fears about dying, and make choices about what treatments they\u2019re willing -\u2013 and not willing -\u2013 to undergo. In rural Humboldt County, in the far northern reaches of California, he\u2019s essentially the only doctor in a 120-mile stretch that does what he does.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s very little sophisticated understanding for the kinds of skills that really matter for people at the very end,\u201d he says.\n\nThe plane glides over the quiet Hoopa Valley, blanketed with trees and mist, and touches down on a narrow landing strip. A loose horse runs next to the plane as we taxi down the runway.\n\nFratkin is here to make a rare house call. He met Paul James -\u2013 his family calls him Pop -\u2013 and his wife, Cessie Abbott, at the hospital in Eureka where he\u2019s on staff. But the four-hour round-trip is too much for them to make. So Fratkin came to them.\n\n\u201cYou made it,\u201d Paul says, as he struggles to sit up on the living room couch.\n\n\u201cI made it,\u201d Fratkin replies.\n\nIt\u2019s a visit Cessie, in particular, has been waiting for. She and her husband know he\u2019s dying. But it\u2019s hard for them to talk to each other about it.\n\n\u201cDr. Fratkin has kind of been my angel to me, because he gets Pop to open up, where he don\u2019t open up to me,\u201d she says. \u201cThen I get to hear how he feels when he doesn\u2019t let me know, because he\u2019s trying to be strong for us, I think.\u201d\n\nFratkin sits on the coffee table across from Paul for the consultation. Cessie sits in a chair at the end of the couch. She tells Dr. Fratkin that the pain in Paul\u2019s belly has been getting worse.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s moaning in his sleep now,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cHave you ever taken morphine tablets?\u201d Fratkin asks, raising his voice so Paul can hear. \u201cHave you ever taken methodone?\u201d\n\nFratkin breezes through the medical portion of the consult. He\u2019s most interested in talking to Paul about his emotional experience, the human experience. Fratkin firmly believes there should be a spiritual component of these conversations.\n\n\u201cYeah, Paul, there\u2019s more to you than this body of yours, isn\u2019t there?\u201d he says, a refrain he repeats with almost all of his patients.\n\n\u201cOh yeah,\u201d says Paul, then goes quiet. He\u2019s a full-blooded Yurok, and talks about how happy he is when he\u2019s in the mountains, hunting with his grandsons.\n\nCessie says she can hear him praying when he\u2019s alone in the bathroom.\n\nSo Fratkin asks Paul to light some Indian root and say a prayer now. After a few more requests, Paul agrees.\n\n\u201cGreat spirit, that created this earth,\u201d he begins, his eyes clenched shut.\n\nBy the time Fratkin leaves the Hoopa Valley, he\u2019s spent half a day with one patient. This is something the hospital in Eureka just can\u2019t afford for him to do.\n\nFratkin says he\u2019s under constant pressure to see patient after patient to meet the hospital\u2019s billing quotas.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very hard for one doctor to manage the complexity of each individual patient and to crank it out in any way that generates productive revenue,\u201d he says.\n\nFratkin\u2019s convinced he can\u2019t do the kind of work he wants to do within the health care system. He feels overworked and underappreciated. So he quit.\n\nInstead, he\u2019s going to launch a start-up.\n\n\u201cI had to sort out an out-of-the-box solution,\u201d he says.\n\nHe calls his new company ResolutionCare. There will be no office, no clinic. He wants to save money on rent and upkeep and put those resources into hiring a team of people who can do home visits. When time is stretched, he plans to use video conferencing \u2013 or telemedicine \u2013 to consult with patients, from a provider\u2019s laptop to the patient\u2019s home computer.\n\nTelemedicine is a rarity in palliative medicine and end-of-life care, says Robert Moore, chief medical officer for Partnership HealthPlan of California, a managed care plan for Medi-Cal, the state\u2019s insurance plan for the poor, which covers nearly 30 percent of people who live in Humboldt County.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a vast underuse of telemedicine in general,\u201d Moore says.\n\nStudies are mixed on how receptive older patients are to telemedicine. Some patients are put off by the screens or challenged by the technology, others simply forget that it\u2019s there.\n\nMoore says Fratkin might run into trouble getting paid for home visits or video conferencing. Medicare and Medi-Cal only pay for face-to-face visits. Insurance plans that do reimburse for these services don\u2019t reimburse very well.\n\nThat\u2019s why Fratkin has cooked up a multi-tiered business plan to finance the venture. He\u2019s cultivating private donors and is looking for foundation grants. He\u2019s arranged an independent contract to sell his services back to the hospital he\u2019s leaving. And, the requisite piece of any new start-up, he launched a crowdfunding campaign to back training he\u2019d like to do for other palliative medicine doctors who practice in rural areas.\n\nWith only a week to go before the fundraising campaign closes, it has stalled at less than 50 percent of the $100,000 goal.\n\nDown the line, Fratkin is even thinking of asking some of his more well-off patients to pay out-of-pocket for his services.\n\n\u201cYeah, yeah, I think I would,\u201d says Mary Maloney, a retired nurse who is dying of esophageal cancer. She tried radiation and chemo for a while, but both made her feel awful \u2013- she had terrible abdominal pain, nausea, and esophageal spasms. Dr. Fratkin was the one who told her it was okay to stop treatment.\n\n\u201cI mean, I love life. I don\u2019t want to let it go,\u201d Maloney says from the recliner in her home in Blue Lake. \u201cBut I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m willing enough to put myself through all the things I\u2019d have to put myself through. Because it just makes you so sick.\u201d\n\nInstead, she\u2019s been reading to her granddaughters and taking her dog to compete in the agility trials.\n\n\u201cThese last months, almost a year, I\u2019ve had such an amazing trip,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s been great.\u201d\n\nFratkin says he\u2019s cared for more than a thousand people in Humboldt County at the end of their lives. He admits not everyone likes his approach. Some find him off-putting or abrupt.\n\n\u201cI wish I could say my batting average was a thousand,\u201d he says. \u201cBut there are some people who aren\u2019t welcoming of a clear and direct acknowledgement of the seriousness of terminal illness.\u201d\n\nBut there are people like Cessie Abbott and Paul James and Mary Maloney who love him. Fratkin hopes enough satisfied patients will step forward to help get the start-up off the ground.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Palliative medicine physician Michael Fratkin gets off a plane after visiting a patient on the Hoopa Valley Native American reservation.
