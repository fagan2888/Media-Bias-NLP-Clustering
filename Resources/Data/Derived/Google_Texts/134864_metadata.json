And like nearly 7,000 others since the war in Afghanistan began in October 2001, and the war in Iraq 17 months later, they have each been forced to cope in their own way with the sad new normal.\n\nFor Scott Bill, a Sarasota residential builder, that has largely meant spending his free time trying to raise awareness of and money for the Naval Special Warfare community that his son Brian loved so much.\n\nOn Aug. 6, 2011, Chief Petty Officer Brian Bill, 31, a member of the Naval Special Warfare Development Group, was flying in a Chinook CH-47 helicopter, on a mission in Wardak province in Afghanistan, his fourth tour of duty in that country. The helicopter, call sign Extortion 17, was shot down, killing Brian Bill and 37 others.\n\nIt remains the deadliest single incident of either Operation Enduring Freedom or Operation Iraqi Freedom. With 25 commandos on board including 17 SEALs, five Navy Special Warfare and three Air Force Special Operations personnel, the shoot down was also the worst single-day disaster in the 27-year history of U.S. Special Operations Command, headquartered at MacDill Air Force Base. There were also five Army National Guardsman and Reservists on board, as well as seven Afghan commandos and an Afghan interpreter. A Naval Special Warfare dog also perished.\n\nScott Bill\u2019s mission since has been to make life easier for his son\u2019s community. And his vision starts with a dream unfulfilled.\n\n\u201cMy son Brian and I had discussed the concept of having a Bill family vacation home in the Florida Keys,\u201d says Bill. \u201cA place where we could all congregate together to relax and enjoy outdoor activities like sailing, fishing, diving, etc. Brian had just obtained his commercial pilot\u2019s license and loved to fly, especially float seaplanes. Our idea was to fly in the family for great vacations to a remote retreat.\u201d\n\nBill, 65, says he and his son \u201chad promised each other that we would do this someday in the future.\u201d\n\nThe Extortion 17 shoot down changed all that.\n\nBut Bill says the dream will become a reality, if not for his son, for Brian Bill\u2019s fellow commandos and their families.\n\nBill is working to create \u201cBrian\u2019s House,\u201d a retreat home where up to five Naval Special Warfare veterans and families can spend a week away from the grind of everyday life, \u201csailing, fishing, boating, kayaking, paddle boarding and other outdoor activities,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cA place where they were welcome anytime,\u201d he says. \u201cA place for healing and growing. A place to strengthen their lives after a horrific loss.\u201d\n\nBrian\u2019s House would run on the SEAL ethos of teamwork, says Bill.\n\n\u201cOur sons and brothers took care of each other on the battlefield,\u201d he says. \u201cThey had each other\u2019s back. I felt it was time for us to get to know each other and do the same.\u201d\n\nBill says he has a property in mind, on Manasota Key. He is trying to raise $1.6 million to buy it and another $500,000 to have in reserve for annual expenses.\n\nTo help meet that goal, Bill is holding a $100-a-head fundraising lunch next Monday, Dec. 1, at the Sarasota Yacht Club main dining room.\n\nJason Redman, retired Navy SEAL, author of The Trident, and founder of Wounded Wear will be a guest speaker along with recently retired Navy SEAL Vice Adm. Joseph D. Kernan, among other things the former deputy commander of U.S. Southern Command.\n\nThe idea for the retreat began percolating, says Bill, in the months after his son died and he began to do speaking engagements on behalf of the Navy SEAL Foundation.\n\n\u201cThe more veterans I came in contact with,\u201d he says, \u201cthe more I wanted to help them. The more families I met, the more I thought about the retreat house idea.\u201d\n\nAnd, as he did the speaking engagements and fundraising events on behalf of the Navy commandos, Bill says he began to feel the same sense of community his son had experienced.\n\n\u201cIt finally dawned on me that the house should be for the Navy SEAL veterans and their families,\u201d he says. \u201cThey had become my family \u2014 a much larger one than the Bill family. It was now the brotherhood of Navy SEALs family.\u201d\n\nBill says while the Navy SEAL Foundation and other organizations do a tremendous job of taking care of the force and families, there is nothing quite like Brian\u2019s House as a way to bond and heal.\n\nHe envisions Naval Special Warfare veterans, surviving spouses and children and Gold Star parents and their families as those who would be welcome at Brian\u2019s House.\n\n\u201cWe have community professionals that are offering arts programs, equine programs and cooking classes,\u201d he says. \u201cWe will have a staff registered professional counselor that will meet with the Gold Star parents and families.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s all aimed at encouraging healing. By linking people who know best the damage done.\n\n\u201cOur primary focus is to offer a means for these Naval Special Warfare families to forge relationships with other Naval Special Warfare families. It will give them an opportunity to share their experiences with other families that have experienced similar ones. Hopefully this will start a healing process and better their lives.\u201d\n\nChildren, he said, will be prime beneficiaries.\n\n\u201cChildren who have lost their fathers will have an opportunity to learn traditional skills that their fathers would have wanted to teach them,\u201d he says. Leadership. Tenacity. Courage. Outdoor activities.\u201d\n\nFor tickets or reservations, contact The Brian Bill Foundation (941) 840-4204, email Bill at scott@brianbillfoundation.org or visit brianbillfoundation.org.\n\n\u2756 \u2756 \u2756\n\nSpeaking of SEALs, there\u2019s another charity event in the area raising funds on behalf of that community.\n\nThe 6th Annual Tampa Bay Frogman Swim, which raises funds for the Navy SEAL Foundation, takes place Jan. 11 and organizers are looking for escort kayakers and volunteers.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re not swimming and would still like to support the event, please consider helping out on race day,\u201d says Kurt Ott, one of the organizers. \u201cWe\u2019re looking for experienced and skilled kayakers to escort swimmers and provide navigation and safety support. We also have a number of volunteer roles open both at the start and finish area.\u201d\n\nThe swim is also looking for a Tampa area bus or limo company to help sponsor the swim and provide one to two shuttle buses to transport swimmers from the finish area back to the start area after the race.\n\nThe Tampa Bay Frogman Swim started in 2010 as an impromptu event to raise money for Lt. Dan Cnossen, a SEAL who lost both his legs in Afghanistan to an IED explosion in 2009. That first Tampa Bay Frogman Swim attracted 38 swimmers who braved frigid waters swimming from Gandy Beach in St. Petersburg to Picnic Island in Tampa. They raised $33,000 for Cnossen and his family.\n\nThe event has mushroomed since. Registration for the 2015 swim sold out in 33 minutes and organizers say the goal is to surpass the 2014 amount of $275,000 and hopefully reach $300,000 in support of the Navy SEAL Foundation.\n\nAmong other things, the foundation provides survivor support including mortgage relief, emergency relief, and home maintenance, post deployment retreats for returning personnel and their families to reconnect and transition assistance program partnership with The Honor Foundation.\n\nFor more information, or to donate, go to http://tampabayfrogman.com.\n\n\u2666 The Pentagon announced no deaths last week in its ongoing contingency operations.\n\nThere have been 2,341 U.S. troop deaths in support of Operation Enduring Freedom, the nation\u2019s longest war and two deaths in Operation Inherent Resolve, the nation\u2019s newest conflict.\n\nhaltman@tampatrib.com\n\n(813) 259-7629\n\n@haltman", "article_metadata": {"taboola-pub-time": "Sun, 23 Nov 2014 15:07:02 -0400", "Description": "The day the helicopter went down, 30 American families were thrust into the depths of despair.
