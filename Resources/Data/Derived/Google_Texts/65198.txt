Singer John Legend and his model wife, Chrissy Teigen, hired a fleet of food trucks Sunday to feed New York City demonstrators still protesting a grand jury decision not to indict the police officer who caused the death of Eric Garner.

The celebrity couple organized the food trucks through the activist group Operation Help or Hush at Union Square on Sunday, News One reported.

Hundreds of protesters continue to gather in the city following the deaths of Garner and Ferguson, Missouri, teen Michael Brown, who were both black and unarmed before being killed by white police officers who did not face charges in their deaths.

Mr. Legend has been vocal following the racial unrest in Ferguson, even dedicating a line in his song, “Glory,” to the embattled St. Louis suburb: “That’s why Rosa sat on the bus/That’s why we walk through Ferguson with our hands up,” News One reported.

Protesters on Sunday were treated to three popular city food trucks that serve a variety of fare, including Korean barbecue, mac & cheese and empenadas, News One reported.
