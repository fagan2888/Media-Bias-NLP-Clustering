Close enough that, if you were Colorado, your nerves were frayed, the pit in your stomach deep with fear.\n\nThe minutes slowly passed. The places tallied. The runners scored. Then came the cheers, and they were not bellows from the mouths of the men from the Rocky Mountains. Colorado, ranked No. 1 in the nation all year, lost in a heartbreaking upset to No. 2-ranked Syracuse by a mere nine points at E.P. \u201cTom\u201d Sawyer State Park, 82-91, ending their title streak at two.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a test of character,\u201d senior Morgan Pearson said, holding back tears. \u201cSyracuse ran amazing. They had three guys in the top 10 \u2026 we had five All-Americans. We didn\u2019t run bad at all. I think all of us wish we did better.\u201d\n\nRELATED: By the Numbers: How Syracuse defeated Colorado in the race\u2019s last 2K\n\nEven after Pierce Murphy ran the race of his life, finishing third overall in 29 minutes, 37 seconds on the 10K course, it was not enough. Syracuse stacked three in the top 10: sophomore Justyn Knight in fourth overall (third in team scoring), Colin Bennie eighth (seventh) and Martin Hehir ninth (eighth).\n\n\u201cMost of these guys \u2014 outside of Justyn \u2014 weren\u2019t recruited by anybody,\u201d Syracuse coach Chris Fox said. \u201cThey\u2019re just regular dudes that try hard.\u201d\n\nOutside of Murphy, Colorado put no one else in the top 20. Pearson was 25th (20th), freshman John Dressel was 26th (21st), junior Ben Saarel was 31st (23rd) and senior Connor Winter was 33rd (25th).\n\nAt the NCAA championships, runners are scored by their place, excluding individuals not part of a full team. The third-place team finisher gets three points, the 10th place finisher 10 points, the 100th place finisher 100 points, and so on. A team\u2019s top five runners are scored, and the lowest score wins.\n\nPHOTOS: 2015 NCAA cross country championships\n\nOregon junior Edward Cheserek easily won his third straight individual NCAA cross country title. Senior Molly Siedel of Notre Dame won overall for the women.\n\n\u201cThey (Syracuse) are a real good team. We knew they were good. We knew it was going to be them, or us, or Stanford,\u201d coach Mark Wetmore told The Denver Post. \u201cNine points in a meet like this is a blink of the eye. They beat us fair and square.\u201d\n\nTo understand Wetmore\u2019 perspective, consider this: If Colorado\u2019s second, third, fourth and fifth runners had each run four second faster than their final times, and no other places had changed, the Buffs would have tied Syracuse, and then won by a sixth-man tiebreaker. CU\u2019s average time was just 1.7 seconds slower than Syracuse\u2019s.\n\nThat\u2019s the cruelty of cross country at the elite collegiate level.\n\n\u201cThey did everything we asked them to,\u201d Wetmore said. \u201cMaybe when I got back tomorrow and process it, I\u2019ll decide I should have asked them to do something else. But they did their jobs.\u201d\n\nThe team put forth stoic faces after a race, talking about how they raced hard and \u201cleft it all out on the course,\u201d as Murphy said. But away from the crowds, the tears came. Four seniors, in their final cross country meet in a Buffs uniform, saw a season-long goal slip away in just 30 minutes.\n\nPearson, Colorado\u2019s No. 2 finisher and a fifth-year senior, admitted feeling the pressure to three-peat.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of funny. Syracuse probably feels how we did two years ago, when we were the underdogs,\u201d Pearson said, referring to the Buffs\u2019 2013 championship team, of which he was part.\n\nBen Saarel, CU\u2019s top returner next year, racing only his second meet in a Buffs uniform since struggling with mononucleosis earlier this season, looked despondent. He finished 31st overall after a top-10 finish last year.\n\n\u201cI should have gotten out faster,\u201d he said of the race, which is notorious for its quick starts. \u201cI had no confidence going into this week, with my health. I\u2019m tired when I get up, tired when I go to bed, so I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s the mono coming back, or what. It\u2019s been really tough. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on. I\u2019m a little frustrated right now.\u201d\n\nDespite the setback, Colorado finished as the best combined team after the women also finished second earlier in the day in the 6K race \u2014 in line with their No. 2 ranking, and far back from the overwhelming favorite New Mexico.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very happy with second,\u201d said junior Erin Clark, who finished 11th overall and was CU\u2019s top runner. \u201cI knew the New Mexico team was stacked. And I thought maybe on a crazy day, we run super well, they have an off day, and we could win. That didn\u2019t happen. They ran really well.\u201d\n\nThey return all but one runner, senior Maddie Alm, a Monarch alumna.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m proud of the women, proud of the men,\u201d Wetmore said. \u201cWish we had 10 less points on the men\u2019s side, but I know they ran their hearts out.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Colorado upset by Syracuse at NCAA cross country championships", "title": "Colorado upset by Syracuse at NCAA cross country championships", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/11/21/colorado-upset-by-syracuse-at-ncaa-cross-country-championships/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151121__BS2C1352p1.jpg", "height": 425}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151121__BS2C1352p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-11-21T14:20:35+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-20T03:06:34+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Running, University of Colorado"}, "article_summary": "PHOTOS: 2015 NCAA cross country championshipsOregon junior Edward Cheserek easily won his third straight individual NCAA cross country title.\nFour seniors, in their final cross country meet in a Buffs uniform, saw a season-long goal slip away in just 30 minutes.\nThat\u2019s the cruelty of cross country at the elite collegiate level.\nLOUISVILLE, Ky. \u2014 When the pack of four Colorado runners came in just a handful of places apart, but ahead of Syracuse\u2019s fifth, everyone watching the team standings here at the NCAA Cross Country Championships on Saturday knew it was close.\nAt the NCAA championships, runners are scored by their place, excluding individuals not part of a full team."}
