One of the key reasons for applying medical management criteria is for quality assurance and patient safety. For example, a woman seeking hormonal therapy who is a smoker who would be at increased risk for stroke ...medical management could catch that,\" Moran said.\n\nSchneiderman will introduce legislation on Monday that will require insurance companies in New York to cover all the methods of birth control approved by the Federal Food and Drug Administration, a provision that is already part of the Affordable Care Act, the Daily News reported Sunday.\n\nRead Schneiderman\u2019s letter to insurers here: http://bit.ly/1PB1s2O\n\nRead Lawsky\u2019s letter to insurers here: http://bit.ly/1PB1CY2\n\nAuthors:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Politico PRO", "description": "<p>ALBANY-In a sequence of events described by one insurance industry official as a &quot;playground shoving match&quot; between state officials, both Attorney General Eric Schneiderman and Department of Financial Services superintendent Ben Lawsky are seeking information from insurance companies about how their plans cover contraception, after receiving information that some insurers may be improperly charging consumers for birth control.</p>", "title": "Schneiderman, then Lawsky, seek insurer contraception data", "url": "http://www.politico.com/states/new-york/albany/story/2015/05/schneiderman-then-lawsky-seek-insurer-contraception-data-022012", "image": "http://static.politico.com/capny/sites/default/files/a%20-%20lawsky%20(1)_0.png", "type": "article"}, "description": "<p>ALBANY-In a sequence of events described by one insurance industry official as a &quot;playground shoving match&quot; between state officials, both Attorney General Eric Schneiderman and Department of Financial Services superintendent Ben Lawsky are seeking information from insurance companies about how their plans cover contraception, after receiving information that some insurers may be improperly charging consumers for birth control.</p>", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "One of the key reasons for applying medical management criteria is for quality assurance and patient safety.\n\"Medical management is not used to limit or otherwise hamper access to contraceptives.\nFor example, a woman seeking hormonal therapy who is a smoker who would be at increased risk for stroke ...medical management could catch that,\" Moran said.\nRead Schneiderman\u2019s letter to insurers here: http://bit.ly/1PB1s2ORead Lawsky\u2019s letter to insurers here: http://bit.ly/1PB1CY2Authors:\nUnder the provisions of the Affordable Care Act, health plans are required to provide full insurance coverage for any birth control methods approved by the Federal Food and Drug Administration, without requiring patients to share in the costs."}
