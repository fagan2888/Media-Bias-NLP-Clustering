U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, is under attack again by a Washington lawmaker, and this time it’s not a Republican.

The freshman senator has drawn the ire of Rep. Matt Cartwright, D-Pa., for saying the Obamacare website is run by “Nigerian email scammers.”

During an appearance Tuesday on the pro-Obama cable network MSNBC, Cartwright suggested the comment is racist and only appeals to “fairly backward people” in the Republican Party.

After receiving an eight-minute standing ovation Monday from a crowd in Texas, Cruz joked about the disastrous launch of the Obamacare website.

“You may have noticed that all the Nigerian email scammers have become a lot less active lately,” Cruz told the audience. “They all have been hired to run the Obamacare website.”

The comment plays on notorious email scams designed to trick the gullible into handing over large sums of money. While the scam is not limited to Nigeria, the nation has come to be associated with this fraud.

“I wonder how much off-the-cuff that really was, and how calculated it was to appeal to Sen. Cruz’s base, many of whom believe that the president is from Africa,” U.S. Rep. Matt Cartwright, D-Pa., said in response to the humorous comment.

“There are a lot of fairly backward people that are a part of the base of people like Sen. Cruz and comments like that are right up their ally,” Cartwright added.

In the hyper-sensitive era of Obama, the first African-American president, the Democratic Party will have you believe any reference to Africa is off limits to a conservative.

But as frequently as Democrats are now playing the race card, that alone may be the best indication yet of just how much of a failure the Obamacare launch has been thus far.
