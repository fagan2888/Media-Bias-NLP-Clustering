In 2012, Christie vetoed a state health insurance exchange bill.\n\nUnder Obamacare, the federal government is relying heavily on states to use their own resources to support the law by setting up a state exchange. Why? Because the federal government simply couldn\u2019t handle implementing the law on their own.\n\nHowever, Christie stopped short of doing anything else to stop Obamacare. In fact, he propped it up.\n\nThe next thing states could have done to help kill Obamacare was to refuse to expand Medicaid under Obamacare. However, Governor Christie accepted Medicaid expansion in New Jersey.\n\nIn fact, the Wall Street Journal ran an article noting that Christie\u2019s move to expand Medicaid under Obamacare had angered Republicans.\n\nThe third thing Christie could have done to stop Obamacare was to prohibit the State Insurance Commissioner from investigating and enforcing health insurance requirements. However, Christie did not do so.\n\nFinally, Christie could have used legislation to block the IRS\u2019s ObamaCare taxes by suspending the licenses of insurers that accept the subsidies. \u201cSince no insurer would then accept one, not a single employer in the state could be hit with the employer-mandate penalties those subsidies trigger,\u201d states the Tenth Amendment Center. However, Christie didn\u2019t do so.\n\nJudge Andrew Napolitano said that if a number of states were willing to follow the above 4 steps, then Obamacare would be gutted.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTaken together, had Christie performed these four steps, he could have actually stopped the implementation of Obamacare in New Jersey. However, he did the opposite, which actually saved Obamacare in New Jersey.\n\nFOLLOW MICHAEL LOTFI ON Facebook, Twitter & LinkedIn.", "article_metadata": {"description": "During Tuesday night's Republican undercard debate hosted by Fox Business News, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie tried to convince America that he stood up to the Obama agenda", "generator": "Powered by Visual Composer - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.", "author": "Michael Lotfi", "og": {"site_name": "Ben Swann's Truth In Media", "description": "During Tuesday night's Republican undercard debate hosted by Fox Business News, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie tried to convince America that he stood up to the Obama agenda", "title": "Fact Check: Christie Did Not Stop Obamacare in New Jersey", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 607, "identifier": "http://truthinmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Screenshot-2015-11-10-at-7.15.43-PM.png", "height": 321}, "updated_time": "2015-11-11T13:27:25-04:00", "url": "http://truthinmedia.com/christie-new-jersey-obamacare/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "During Tuesday night's Republican undercard debate hosted by Fox Business News, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie tried to convince America that he stood up to the Obama agenda", "creator": "@BenSwann_", "image": "http://truthinmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Screenshot-2015-11-10-at-7.15.43-PM.png", "title": "Fact Check: Christie Did Not Stop Obamacare in New Jersey", "site": "@BenSwann_", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 801708913249498, "pages": 124075334324092}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/BenSwannRealityCheck", "published_time": "2015-11-11T11:12:45-04:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/MikeLotfiTN", "section": "Election", "modified_time": "2015-11-11T13:27:25-04:00", "tag": "Republican Primary"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "However, Christie stopped short of doing anything else to stop Obamacare.\nThe third thing Christie could have done to stop Obamacare was to prohibit the State Insurance Commissioner from investigating and enforcing health insurance requirements.\nAdvertisementTaken together, had Christie performed these four steps, he could have actually stopped the implementation of Obamacare in New Jersey.\nThe next thing states could have done to help kill Obamacare was to refuse to expand Medicaid under Obamacare.\nThe first step is refusing to set up a state exchange."}
