Lawmakers expressed hope at the time of her nomination that she would serve a full four-year tenure as OPM chief.\n\n\"In my initial meetings with Beth Cobert, she has impressed me as a talented, qualified and competent choice for OPM director,\u201d said House Oversight and Government Reform Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz Jason Chaffetz41 Secret Service employees disciplined after Chaffetz leak Overnight Cybersecurity: Guccifer plea deal raises questions in Clinton probe Lawmakers: Social Security vulnerable to hackers MORE (R-Utah), who led the charge against Archuleta and OPM leadership during a series of hearings on the hacks.\n\nSen.

Critics argue the OPM took too long to award the contract for a suite of identity theft protection services offered to victims, and too long again to mail notifications.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell Mitch McConnellPuerto Rico debt relief faces serious challenges in Senate Overnight Healthcare: Momentum on mental health? | Zika bills head to conference | Only 10 ObamaCare co-ops left Trump outlines \u2018America First\u2019 energy plan MORE (R-Ky.) said in November that he will use the nomination process to seek more answers on how the administration will rebuild the trust that it can properly secure sensitive data.\n\nThe news came on the heels of a decision to have the Defense Department secure the millions of background check forms that were exposed during the hack.\n\nThe Obama administration on Friday said it would establish a new government-wide office, the National Background Investigations Bureau (NBIB), to handle background investigations for almost the entire federal government. But the DOD will design, build, secure and operate the NBIB\u2019s entire information technology system, the administration said.\n\n\u201cThis approach will leverage DOD\u2019s significant national security, IT and cybersecurity expertise, incorporating security into the fundamental design of the systems, strengthening the security of the data environment, and providing robust privacy protections,\u201d said an OPM release.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The committee will discuss the White House\u2019s choice of Beth Cobert.", "description": "The committee will discuss the White House\u2019s choice of Beth Cobert.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Katie Bo Williams", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "The committee will discuss the White House\u2019s choice of Beth Cobert.", "title": "Senate panel to consider OPM nominee next week", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/266734-senate-committee-to-consider-nomination-of-permanent-opm-leader", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/opm_060514getty.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-01T06:09:47-05:00", "type": "article"}, "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-01T06:09-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/266734-senate-committee-to-consider-nomination-of-permanent-opm-leader", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "dcterms.date": "2016-01-22T14:24-05:00", "dcterms.creator": "Katie Bo Williams", "dcterms.type": "Text", "article": {"published_time": "2016-01-22T14:24:07-05:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-01T06:09:47-05:00"}, "keywords": ",Mitch McConnell, Jason Chaffetz, Tom Carper,", "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/266734-senate-committee-to-consider-nomination-of-permanent-opm-leader", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "The committee will discuss the White House\u2019s choice of Beth Cobert.", "card": "summary", "title": "Senate panel to consider OPM nominee next week"}, "dcterms.title": "Senate panel to consider OPM nominee next week"}, "article_summary": "Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell Mitch McConnellPuerto Rico debt relief faces serious challenges in Senate Overnight Healthcare: Momentum on mental health?\n), the top Democrat on the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, worked with Cobert in her role at the OMB.\nLawmakers expressed hope at the time of her nomination that she would serve a full four-year tenure as OPM chief.\nThe Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee is set to weigh the nomination of Beth Cobert to be the full director of the Office of Personnel Management.\nADVERTISEMENTThe committee will hold a hearing Tuesday on Cobert, who is currently the acting director of the agency."}
