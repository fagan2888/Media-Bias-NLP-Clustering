Ted Cruz on Saturday repeatedly called for \u201creigniting the miracle of America,\u201d a phrase that sounds like a slogan for a possible presidential campaign.\n\nSpeaking to activists at the Iowa Freedom Summit, Cruz introduced his wife in the crowd and said: \u201cHeidi and I are here today for the same reasons that all of y\u2019all are here. Because we look at what\u2019s happening in this country and we fear for our children. We fear for our grandchildren.\u201d\n\nTalking about the 2016 election, Cruz told voters to support people who not only say the right things, but have a history of fighting for those issues.\n\n\u201cIowa plays a unique and special role in the political process. The men and women gathered here today and across the state, you have a responsibility that you take very seriously to scrutinize any candidate for national office. To look them in the eyes and to hold them to account.\u201d\n\nHe predicted that Republicans running for president will tell those in the crowd that they are the \u201cmost conservative guy that ever lived.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell you know what?\u201d he said. \u201cTalk is cheap\u2026And one of the most important roles of the men and women in this room, the men and women in Iowa will play, is to look each candidate in the eye and say, \u2018Don\u2019t talk. Show me.'\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you say you support liberty, show me where you stood up for it. If you say you support religious liberties, show me where you stood and fought for them. If you say you oppose Obamacare, show me where you stood and fought against it.\u201d\n\nCruz, who acknowledges he is thinking about running for president in 2016, made clear he won\u2019t be a stranger to the state. \u201cGod bless the great state of Iowa,\u201d he said.\n\nFollow Alex on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Alex Pappas", "description": "'If you say you support liberty, show me where you stood up for it'", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "DES MOINES, Iowa \u2014 Texas Sen.
