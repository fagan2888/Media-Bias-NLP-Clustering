The city condemned it after a fire inside. Now it\u2019s being torn down.\n\nRobert Morris lives next door. He says he\u2019s glad to see these abandoned homes in his neighborhood finally get demolished.\n\nROBERT MORRIS: This neighborhood right here, this used to be high class over here. I mean this whole south corridor was all, it was nice. It was really nice.\n\nKARLA MURTHY: These demolitions are part of a citywide plan to eliminate blight and rebuild. Since the 1950s, Youngstown\u2019s population has declined by 60 percent, from about 168-thousand to 65-thousand and is still shrinking. Thousands of empty homes have been left behind, crippling the housing market, and eroding the social fabric of this once mighty industrial base.\n\nWhen the steel mills closed in the 1970s, Youngstown lost 40-thousand good paying jobs. Today, almost 40 percent of residents live below the federal poverty line \u2014 earning less than 24-thousand a 300 dollars a year for a family of four.\n\nHUNTER MORRISON: What\u2019s a city to do as a city? Pick itself up, dust itself off and start all over again, move forward.\n\nKARLA MURTHY: Hunter Morrison is an urban planner who has worked on rebuilding Youngstown since 2002. He says the plan started with a simple premise: accept that the city was smaller.\n\nHUNTER MORRISON: In America, the entire business of planning and development is based on the phenomena of growth. But what happens when communities one after another see themselves shrinking?\n\nKARLA MURTHY: Over the last 14 years, this new smaller mindset has been the guiding vision for the city, which took stock of its assets, like Youngstown State University, with 14,000 students. The city and the university developed blighted land to connect the campus to downtown \u2013 which now has new housing and more places to go out.\n\nHUNTER MORRISON: Today, if you talk to a student, they go down to the restaurants. Some of them live downtown who never would have lived there before.\n\nKARLA MURTHY: But beyond downtown, the city didn\u2019t have the resources to fix its broken neighborhoods. Fewer residents means less tax revenue. So in 2009, the city created a new nonprofit, the Youngstown neighborhood development corporation, or Y.N.D.C., in partnership with the Raymond John Wean Foundation.\n\nIAN BENISTON: You could walk to my house if you want to keep going\u2026\u201d\n\nKARLA MURTHY: Ian Beniston is the executive director. He grew up in Youngstown. His father worked at a steel mill until it closed in 1980.\n\nIAN BENISTON: We don\u2019t go around here talking about utopian visions. We\u2019re dealing with the real basics here. We\u2019ve just got to get neighborhoods cleaned up.\n\nKARLA MURTHY: The Y.N.D.C. has an annual budget of 3 million dollars. The group surveyed every neighborhood in the city to figure out where it could make the biggest difference and create more stability.\n\nIAN BENISTON: Our focus, as an organization, is on those neighborhoods in the middle. So, neighborhoods that have many signs of distress, but they\u2019re not to a point where we have 70 or 80 percent vacancy. So that even in the future, we do at least have these pockets, if nothing else, of healthy neighborhoods.\n\nKARLA MURTHY: One of the first neighborhoods the Y.N.D.C. targeted is called \u201cIdora,\u201d where a quarter of the houses were vacant\u2026.Like this one currently being renovated by the Y.N.D.C. Tiffany Sokol has been overseeing this project.\n\nTIFFANY SOKOL: We\u2019ve been able to acquire a lot of properties at zero cost either through bank donations or private personal donations\u2026\n\nKARLA MURTHY: Many homes the Y.N.D.C. acquires are foreclosed properties and are renovated with the help of \u201cAmericorps\u201d volunteers.\n\nTIFFANY SOKOL: There\u2019s an abundance of vacant homes but unfortunately the quality is very low. So part of what we\u2019re doing here is trying to raise the standard and raise the quality of homes available.\n\nKARLA MURTHY: A couple blocks away is a house the Y.N.D.C. just finished.\n\nTIFFANY SOKOL: This one was built in the 70s, so it\u2019s really out of character for the neighborhood.\n\nVO: It\u2019s listed for sale for 40 thousand dollars\u2026Above Youngstown\u2019s median home price of 31-thousand, but affordable in this market.\n\nKARLA MURTHY: Have you had any problems getting people to buy the homes that you\u2019ve renovated?\n\nTIFFANY SOKOL: No, most of our homes generally we end up pre-selling before we are even done with the rehabilitation.\n\nKARLA MURTHY: Y.N.D.C. helps potential buyers who have low-to-moderate incomes through housing counseling and mortgage financing.\n\nIn the past six years in Idora, 137 abandoned homes have been demolished, 35 homes have been renovated and sold and 88 occupied homes have been repaired.\n\nIAN BENISTON: This was a house we fixed too\u2026\n\nKARLA MURTHY: Today, the occupancy rate of this stripped down, rebuilt neighborhood is 93 percent.\n\nIAN BENISTON: Wait till you see it. It\u2019s pretty awesome\u2026\n\nKARLA MURTHY: Beniston showed me one more feature he\u2019s using as a selling point for Idora: this natural waterfall right in the middle of city.\n\nIAN BENISTON: We had nine vacant homes right by this, yeah, but not anymore.\n\nKARLA MURTHY: Brownlee Woods is another neighborhood where the Y.N.D.C. works. Nancy Martin and her husband Russell have lived here since 1982, and over the years watched people leave as their neighborhood declined.\n\nNANCY MARTIN: We can do one of two things \u2014 you can either sit here on the porch and complain, or you get up and do something.\n\nThese are the benches we just put in\u2026\n\nKARLA MURTHY: She\u2019s president of her neighborhood association and meets regularly with the Y.N.D.C., which also helps residents develop their own neighborhood action plans\u2026\n\nNANCY MARTIN: They bring a list of all the houses that we\u2019re working on, and we go through each one.\n\nKARLA MURTHY: One house that was falling apart was owned by an out of town businessman. Ian Beniston stepped in.\n\nNANCY MARTIN: And he told him, \u201cAre you going to do anything with this property? Cuz if you\u2019re not, we\u2019re taking it\u2026\n\nKARLA MURTHY: The community is taking over that house, and the Y.N.D.C. brought more than a dozen other houses up to code in Brownlee Woods.\n\nIAN BENISTON: We are making progress. I mean, we know that in terms of owner occupancy, vacancy data. However there are still large swaths of the city, the most distressed swaths, where people are still leaving.\n\nKARLA MURTHY: In those areas of Youngstown with heavy vacancy, the focus is on simply eradicating blight with board-ups, demolitions, and cutting the grass.\n\nRobert Morris is happy to see his neighborhood getting cleaned up, but he\u2019s skeptical things will really improve.\n\nKARLA MURTHY: Do you think this area will ever become what it once was?\n\nROBERT MORRIS: No. No, I doubt it. No, it\u2019s over. No jobs. Nobody got jobs. Everybody\u2019s out there trying to hustle to make their buck. You know, that\u2019s\u2014it is what it is.\n\nDAWN GRIFFIN: I\u2019m going to give myself maybe another year or two here\u2026\n\nKARLA MURTHY: Dawn Griffin says she\u2019s had a hard time finding a job in Youngstown, and thinks about leaving. Unemployment in Youngstown is eight-and-half percent, three-and-half percent above than the national average. Griffin, a single mother of three, remembers a better time.\n\nDAWN GRIFFIN: I thought we were rich, you know? [laughs] And we were pretty well off, you know? But what is here?\n\nKARLA MURTHY: She also feels like the city isn\u2019t doing enough, especially in low-income neighborhoods like hers, on the east side of Youngstown.\n\nDAWN GRIFFIN:One of my questions was, \u2018okay, you\u2019re removing the blight, okay, but what\u2019s going to be there? And it\u2019s nothing but a slab on concrete there. No one wants to invest in that. You can\u2019t do it a little bit, you\u2019ve got to go all the way.\n\nKARLA MURTHY: I asked Beniston about their critique.\n\nKARLA MURTHY: Boarding up homes, grass cutting. How\u2019s it really going to make a big difference?\n\nIAN BENISTON: That will improve the quality of life for the people that are living there now, but by no means am I trying to say that in the most distressed of places just cutting grass and boarding up the houses is sufficient. I\u2019m saying it\u2019s the reality of a lack of resources. I think one of the things we need more of here without a doubt is just jobs. That\u2019s the reality of it, that\u2019s why people leave. So until we can get to a point where we\u2019re attracting, developing, creating, even here locally, more jobs. We\u2019re going to be struggling to get to where we need to be.\n\nKARLA MURTHY: Part of Youngstown\u2019s plan to create more jobs is to change its image as a city dominated by steel. Sharon Woodberry, Youngstown\u2019s director of economic development and community planning, is trying to lure technology entrepreneurs\n\nSHARON WOODBERRY: We\u2019re still primarily manufacturing-focused but there are other industries that are emerging.\n\nKARLA MURTHY: She points to \u201cAmerica Makes,\u201d a national institute for 3D printing and also the Youngstown business incubator which has created almost 400 jobs at tech start-ups in Youngstown since 2011.\n\nKARLA MURTHY: But unemployment is still high here, right?\n\nSHARON WOODBERRY: It is. It was a decline over decades. It\u2019s a rebuilding that\u2019s going to take some significant time.\n\nHUNTER MORRISON: There are a lot of obstacles in older industrial communities.\n\nKARLA MURTHY: Urban planner Hunter Morrison says progress may seem slow, but not when you understand what\u2019s happened across this region.\n\nHUNTER MORRISON: These communities are very much like New Orleans. New Orleans lost half its population over a weekend. Flint, Cleveland, Youngstown, Detroit lost it over a generation. It\u2019s a major trauma to a community. It takes a long time to get over it.\n\nKARLA MURTHY: How do you stay hopeful, is it a false sense of hope?\n\nIAN BENISTON: For me it\u2019s not a false of hope, because I have a pretty good memory and I know, for example, what this neighborhood looked like. I\u2019ve also seen streets change, where, you know, dozens of houses have been removed, others have come back to life. I feel good about the progress that we\u2019ve made. Am I satisfied with it? Certainly not.\n\nChasing the Dream: Poverty and Opportunity in America is a multi-platform public media initiative that provides a deeper understanding of the impact of poverty on American society.
