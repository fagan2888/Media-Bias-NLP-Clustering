All 5.3 million hens at the facility will be euthanized to prevent further spreading to the disease.\n\nLast week, bird flu was found in a group of 27,000 turkeys in Buena Vista County, which were also euthanized. Officials stated an entire flock of birds can be wiped out in just two days from the disease.\n\nScientists stated they believe the deadly virus is being distributed via migratory birds in the Mississippi flyway. The first strain found was in this pattern.\n\nThe industry has ramped up its biosecurity since the breakouts. Officials were worried last week that the bird flu virus would infiltrate Iowa\u2019s commercial egg laying industry. Therefore, facilities around the area have been quarantined to prevent further damage. The lethal virus has also been found in many other states across the country.\n\nBy Alex Lemieux\n\nSource:\n\nDes Moines Register\n\nPhoto by Katie Yaeger Rotramel \u2013 Flickr License\n\nShare this: Print\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nPocket\n\nReddit\n\nEmail\n\nTwitter\n\nGoogle\n\nFacebook\n\nTumblr\n\n", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Guardian Liberty Voice", "description": "Officials in Iowa have now found\u00a0a second occurrence\u00a0of avian influenza, commonly known as bird flu, at an egg laying installation\u00a0in Osceola County on Monday, according the the U.S. Department of \u2026", "title": "Bird Flu Strikes Egg Laying Facility in Iowa", "url": "http://guardianlv.com/2015/04/bird-flu-strikes-egg-laying-facility-in-iowa/", "image": {"width": 1024, "identifier": "http://guardianlv.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/chicken.jpg", "height": 768}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "article": {"published_time": "2015-04-20T22:40:38+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-04-20T22:40:38+00:00"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://guardianlv.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/chicken.jpg?w=640", "site": "@ifrackle", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@ifrackle"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd114b\"", "article_summary": "Officials were worried last week that the bird flu virus would infiltrate Iowa\u2019s commercial egg laying industry.\nLast week, bird flu was found in a group of 27,000 turkeys in Buena Vista County, which were also euthanized.\nOfficials in Iowa have now found a second occurrence of avian influenza, commonly known as bird flu, at an egg laying installation in Osceola County on Monday, according the the U.S. Department of Agriculture.\nOfficials stated an entire flock of birds can be wiped out in just two days from the disease.\nAll 5.3 million hens at the facility will be euthanized to prevent further spreading to the disease."}
