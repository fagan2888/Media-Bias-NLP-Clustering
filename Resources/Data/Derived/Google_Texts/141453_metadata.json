Randy Neugebauer</p>\n\nBy Greg Jaklewicz\n\nRandy Neugebauer has won each election since 2004 with a growing percentage of the vote.\n\nThis year, though, he faces three opponents who hope to end the Republican\u2019s string of five terms as U.S. Representative for the 19th Congressional District of Texas.\n\nRunning against the Lubbock incumbent are Neal Marchbanks, a Democrat from Lubbock; Richard \u201cChip\u201d Peterson, a Libertarian from Lubbock; and write-in candidate Donald Vance, of Abilene.\n\nDistrict 19 covers 29 counties including Taylor and 11 other in the Big Country.\n\nEarly voting begins Monday, with Election Day on Nov. 4.\n\nNeugebauer has had three opponents in the general election before. In 2006, he also drew a write-in candidate \u2014 Mike Sadler, who won only 197 votes, or 0.14 percent of ballots cast .\n\nThat year, Taylor County\u2019s Fred Jones ran as the Libertarian candidate \u2014 the only recent time that Peterson\u2019s name has not on the general election ballot. Peterson also has run in 2004, 2008, 2010 and 2012.\n\nOn his website, Peterson states that he runs to give voters an option aside from the two major parties, to present an option other than the incumbent and \u201cto keep pressure on the present incumbent to keep him fiscally conservative and not let him pander to special interests.\u201d\n\n\u201cMost pertinently, Randy has been very bad on civil liberty and citizen\u2019s rights issues in recent years,\u201d Peterson wrote an e-mail to the Reporter-News. \u201cHe has pandered to the establishment in order to curry favor and in the process has helped sell out many of our cherished constitutional protections.\n\n\u201cBy voting for me, people can express a desire for Washington to treat them with respect and not interfere so much in their lives, and their pocketbooks.\u201d\n\nNeugebauer has represented District 19 since 2003, when he won a runoff for the seat vacated by longtime Congressman Larry Combest. He got 50.5 percent of the vote to 49.5 percent for Mike Conaway, who in 2004 would take the District 11 seat that includes 10 Big Country counties.\n\nThe next year, Districts 17 and 19 were combined, forcing Neugebauer into a race with longtime Democrat Charles Stenholm. Neugebauer took 58 percent of the vote to 40 percent for Stenholm, who had served in Congress since his election in 1978.\n\nNeugebauer won re-election with 68 percent of the vote (2006), 72 percent (2008), 78 percent (2010) and 85 percent (2012).\n\nMarchbanks is making his first run at political office, which contrasts to Peterson\u2019s fifth effort against Neugebauer. Vance said he four times sought office in Arizona in the 1980s.\n\nHere a brief recap of the four candidates:\n\nNeugebauer\n\nRandy Neugebauer is on the House agriculture, financial services, and science, space and technology committees. He has been rated by nonpartisan groups as the most conservative of Texas members of the House.\n\nHe twice has made headlines, and not in a good way.\n\nIn May 2010, he shouted \u201cbaby killer\u201d during a speech on the floor of the House by Democrat Bart Stupak of Michigan. Neugebauer apologized, saying the remark was not directed at Stupak.\n\nIn October 2013, he confronted a female U.S. Park Service ranger at the World War II Memorial in Washington, D.C.. It had been closed due to the government shutdown. He later apologized to the ranger, saying his remarks were not directly as her personally.\n\nHe is against wasteful spending, the Affordable Care Act and has supported the farm bill as it supports the farmers and ranchers of this region. He believes President Obama has overreached his authority and supports House Republican efforts to sue the president for executive overreach. He believes the nation\u2019s border with Mexico is not secure, the $17 trillion national debut is outrageous and the president does not have a firm strategy on dealing with the Islamic State. He is against term limits, other than the ones the founding fathers set, congressional elections every two years.\n\nHe has supported veterans health care and promoted the opening of a VA clinic on the Texas Tech campus in Lubbock.\n\nAway from Congress, his work career has included banking and homebuilding.\n\nMARCHBANKS\n\nDuring a visit to Abilene to meet potential voters at the West Texas Fair & Rodeo, Neal Marchbanks spoke to the Reporter-News Community Advisory Board. He called Neugebauer \u201cDr. No,\u201d and said the incumbent was part of the gridlock problem in Washington.\n\nHe said Neugebauer has put forth six bills that became law in 11 years.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s made money\u201d as a congressman, Marchbanks claimed. \u201cIf the people in the rest of the district were that wealthy, we\u2019d all be in high cotton.\u201d\n\nA meteorologist who forecasted for the military with 33 years in civil service, Marchbanks questioned why there was not a Democrat opposing Neugebauer again. There was none in 2012.\n\n\u201cIt was a travesty that we couldn\u2019t get anyone to run. I am very dissatisfied with (Neugebauer) as our representative,\u201d he said, citing the $1 million taxpayers spend annually on the congressman and his staff. \u201cWe used to have giants\u201d in Washington, he said, naming Combest, Stenholm and George Mahon, who served 22 terms in the House. All were Democrats.\n\nMarchbanks volunteered for Hillary Clinton\u2019s unsuccessful 2008 campaign and has volunteered with the Lubbock County Democratic Party.\n\nMarchbanks said he would be willing to work with the other party.\n\n\u201cIf Republicans put forth a bill that\u2019s good for the district, I\u2019d vote for it,\u201d he said.\n\nHe supports term limits \u2014 all three branches should have it, he said. He preferred sanctions against Mexico over sending the National Guard to the Texas-Mexico border to stop the flow of immigrants into the U.S.. There is a correct path to citizenship; amnesty \u201cis not a good way.\u201d\n\nDrawing on his career as a weather forecaster for the military, he believes climate change is real and man made.\n\nHe believes in all the amendments, not just the Second Amendment that \u201cRepublicans like so much.\u201d\n\nAn answer to the abortion issue, he said, is \u201cdon\u2019t get pregnant.\u201d He supports the Affordable Care Act, noting the millions of Texans who are not insured because Medicaid has not been expanded.\n\nHe said Neugebauer has a war chest to work with in his campaign but he was on a \u201cshoestring\u201d budget.\n\nPETERSON\n\n\u201cI am a Libertarian because I believe in the principles espoused by present-day Libertarians and the founders of our country,\u201d Chip Peterson states on his website. \u201cI believe that government should be limited and should be the slave of the people rather than to treat people as its slaves. If government is limited, taxes can be low and markets can operate freely.\u201d\n\nPeterson is a professor emeritus at Texas Tech University. He previously was a professor of finance at Tech and assistant professor of economics at Southern Methodist University, CEO of Lubbock Asset Management Co. and a staff financial economist of the board of governors of the Federal Reserve System.\n\nHe does not accept campaign donation; those could force him to do paperwork, which he wants to avoid.\n\nIn 2010, he wrote that if elected, he would align with those who want to protect the Bill of Rights and cut wasteful spending and \u201cexcessive taxation.\u201d\n\nHe continued, \u201cWhile I recognize that my election to Congress would be a longshot, because of the unique status I would have as the only Libertarian member of Congress, with the help of others and a bully pulpit ... I could do a great deal to help the members of the 19th District and the country as a whole.\u201d\n\nVANCE\n\nIn a six-page letter delivered Sept. 15 to the Reporter-News to \u201cofficially\u201d announce his candidacy, Donald Vance stated there are \u201cnumerous issues to be addressed in this election\u201d and listed the four he deemed most important: Removing federal money tied to national and international programs that \u201cdirectly or indirectly\u201d support abortion; replacing Speaker of the House John Boehner; restoring the U.S. Constitution or \u201cat least begin the process of doing so\u201d; and reviving one man-one woman marriage.\n\nAsked if abortion and same-sex marriage are issues that can fully support a candidate, he said, \u201cThey should be. I believe this is a perilous time.\u201d\n\nHe does not believe Neugebauer \u201cwill challenge the Speaker. However, I am laying down a challenge to do the right thing.\u201d\n\nVance believes Obama \u201cshould be impeached now\u201d and calls what\u2019s wrong in Washington \u201ca common disease within the establishment \u2014 Potomac Fever.\u201d\n\nMoving from Illinois in June 2013, he chose Abilene over Tucson, Arizona \u2014 he previously had lived in Arizona \u2014 \u201cbecause I believe Texas is in a far better position to regain its sovereignty .... I also was impressed with Senator Cruz\u2019s Senate victory.\u201d\n\nHe posts five blogs six days a week, he said.\n\n\u201cIn a normal day, I am dealing with that for 12 or more hours. That leaves no time for me to campaign as normally understood,\u201d he said.\n\nVance has been a high school teacher and coach, owner of Gunslinger Tax Consultant LLC (1980-2010) and currently owns Gunslinger Publications LC. He has launched a series of books titled \u201cThe Black Sword\u201d and authored books on the Constitution, homosexuality and \u201cThe Bold Church of Jesus, the Christ.\u201d\n\n\u201cRealistically it will take a miracle for me to have any (effect) on the election at this late date,\u201d he stated in his announcement letter. He plans to run in the Republican primary in 2016.\n\n\u201cOne thing is certain; I cannot win if I do not run.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"title": "19th Congressional District: Neugebauer has reigned since 2003; can he - should he - be unseated?", "og": {"url": "http://www.reporternews.com/news/politics/elections/19th-congressional-district-neugebauer-has-reigned-since-2003-can-he---should-he---be-unseated-ep-68-344718652.html", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.jrn.com/images/neugebauer_1406322138479_7063348_ver1.0_640_480.png", "height": 480}, "type": "article", "description": "Randy Neugebauer has won each election since 2004 with a growing percentage of the vote.", "title": "19th Congressional District: Neugebauer has reigned since 2003; can he - should he - be unseated?"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.jrn.com/images/neugebauer_1406322138479_7063348_ver1.0_640_480.png", "description": "Randy Neugebauer has won each election since 2004 with a growing percentage of the vote.", "site": "@reporternews", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "19th Congressional District: Neugebauer has reigned since 2003; can he - should he - be unseated?"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://media.jrn.com/designimages/logo-arn-icon-144.png", "__sync_contentCategory": "premium", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe33e6\"", "article_summary": "I believe this is a perilous time.\u201dHe does not believe Neugebauer \u201cwill challenge the Speaker.\nThis year, though, he faces three opponents who hope to end the Republican\u2019s string of five terms as U.S. Representative for the 19th Congressional District of Texas.\nRep.
