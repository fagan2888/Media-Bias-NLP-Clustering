A year after the cash-strapped district signed a $1 billion contract with Apple to purchase iPads for every student, the once-ballyhooed deal has blown up. Now the mess threatens to sully other vendors from Cambridge to Cupertino.\n\nLAUSD superintendent John Deasy is under fire for his cozy connections to Apple. In an effort to deflect attention and perhaps to show that \u201ceverybody else is doing it,\u201d he\u2019s demanded the release of all correspondence between his board members and technology vendors. It promises to be some juicy reading. But at its core, the LAUSD fiasco illustrates just how much gold lies beneath even the dirtiest, most neglected public schoolyard.\n\nAs the U.S. starts implementing federal Common Core State Standards, teachers and administrators are being driven to adopt technology as never before. That has set off a scramble in Silicon Valley to grab as much of the $9 billion K-12 market as possible, and Apple, Google, Cisco and others are mud-wrestling to seize a part of it. Deasy and the LAUSD have given us ringside seats to this match, which shows just how low companies will go.\n\nWhen the Apple deal was announced a year ago, it was touted as the largest ever distribution of computing devices to American students. The Los Angeles Times ran a story accompanied by a photograph of an African-American girl and her classmate, who looked absolutely giddy about their new gadgets. Readers responded to the photo\u2019s idealistic promise \u2014 that every child in Los Angeles, no matter their race or socioeconomic background, would have access to the latest technology, and Deasy himself pledged \u201cto provide youth in poverty with tools that heretofore only rich kids have had.\u201d Laudable as it was, that sentiment assumed that technology would by itself save our underfunded schools and somehow balance our inequitable society.\n\nWhen I heard about the deal, I felt a wave of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. I had sat in a PTA meeting at a public school listening to a similar, albeit much smaller, proposed deal. An Apple vendor had approached administrators in a Santa Barbara County school, offering to sell us iPads. The pitch was that we could help propel our kids into the technological age so that they\u2019d be better prepared for the world, and maybe land a nice-paying, high-tech job somewhere down the line. Clearly, a school contract would be great for Apple, giving it a captive group of impressionable 11-year-olds it could then mold into lifelong customers.\n\nBut parents had to raise a lot of money to seal this deal. \u201cIs Apple giving us a discount?\u201d asked a fellow PTA member. No, we were told. Apple doesn\u2019t give discounts, not even to schools. In the end, we decided to raise funds for an athletics program and some art supplies instead.\n\nTo be fair, PTA moms and dads are no match at the bargaining table for the salespeople at major companies like Google, and Hewlett-Packard. But the LAUSD, with its $6.8 billion budget, had the brains and muscle necessary to negotiate something valuable for its 655,000 students. That was the hope, at least.\n\nAlas, problems began to appear almost immediately. First, some clever LAUSD students hacked the iPads and deleted security filters so they could roam the Internet freely and watch YouTube videos. Then, about $2 million in iPads and other devices went \u201cmissing.\u201d Worse was the discovery that the pricey curriculum software, developed by Pearson Education Corp., wasn\u2019t even complete. And the board looked foolish when it had to pay even more money to buy keyboards for iPads so that students could actually type out their reports.\n\nThen, there was the deal itself. Whereas many companies extend discounts to schools and other nonprofits, Apple usually doesn\u2019t, said George Michaels, executive director of Instructional Development at University of California at Santa Barbara. \u201cWhatever discounts Apple gives are pretty meager.\u201d The Chronicle of Philanthropy has noted Apple\u2019s stingy reputation, and CEO Tim Cook has been trying to change the corporation\u2019s miserly ways by giving $50 million to a local hospital and $50 million to an African nonprofit.\n\nBut the more we learned about the Apple \u201cdeal,\u201d the more the LAUSD board seemed outmaneuvered. The district had bought iPad 4s, which have since been discontinued, but Apple had locked the district into paying high prices for the old models. LAUSD had not checked with its teachers or students to see what they needed or wanted, and instead had forced its end users to make the iPads work. Apple surely knew that kids needed keypads to write reports, but sold them just part of what they needed.\n\nCompared with similar contracts signed by other districts, Apple\u2019s deal for Los Angeles students looked crafty, at best. Perris Union High School District in Riverside County, for example, bought Samsung Chromebooks for only $344 per student. And their laptop devices have keyboards and multiple input ports for printers and thumb drives. The smaller Township High School District 214 in Illinois bought old iPad 2s without the pre-loaded, one-size-fits-all curriculum software. Its price: $429 per student.\n\nBut LAUSD paid Apple a jaw-dropping $768 per student, and LAUSD parents were not happy. As Manel Saddique wrote on a social media site: \u201cBtw, thanks for charging a public school district more than the regular consumer price per unit, Apple.
