This is not an error. It was not a mistake. This was a calculated, purposeful lie.\u201d\n\nLimbaugh added the mainstream media to his list of offenders. He called their biased pro-Obamacare coverage \u201cmedia malpractice\u201d and \u201cone of the worst examples of modern day journalism in my lifetime.\u201d\n\nFor all intents and purposes, Rush said, the media is \u201cjust the PR firm of the Democratic Party.\u201d\n\nAlong with Nixon, Limbaugh compared Obama to his Democratic predecessor Lyndon Baines Johnson.\n\nWith the revelations of outright deception that reach as high as the White House itself, Limbaugh remarked, \u201cYou\u2019re getting close to LBJ territory.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey were lying through their teeth about Vietnam and other things.\u201d\n\nLimbaugh agreed with a caller who said facetiously that Obama is no longer the president as such, but the \u201cofficial spokesman for Obamacare,\u201d rather like a paid pitchman.\n\nThe Watergate scandal that led to President Nixon\u2019s resignation is widely considered one of the most traumatic national events in 20th century American history. It greatly increased the public\u2019s cynicism regarding the political system. Press revelations of Nixon\u2019s \u201cdirty tricks,\u201d such a botched break in at Democratic National Committee headquarters in the Washington, D.C., Watergate building, were compounded by Nixon\u2019s repeated insistence that he had done nothing wrong.
