Washington (CNN) Speaking on the anniversary of Israel's independence, Vice President Joe Biden sought to bolster U.S. ties to the Jewish state amid tensions over a preliminary nuclear deal with Iran.

"We're like family," Biden said. "We have a lot to say to one another. Sometimes you drive each other crazy but we love each other and we protect each other."
