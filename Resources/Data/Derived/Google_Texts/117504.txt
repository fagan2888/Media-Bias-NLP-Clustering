As questions continue mounting over the so-called 'Bridgegate' scandal involving the September closure of three local-access lanes to Fort Lee from the George Washington Bridge, Gov. Chris Christie has raised an additional concern about those lanes.

"The fact that one town has three lanes dedicated to it, that kind of gets me sauced," the governor said Dec. 2, in response to Democratic lawmakers' demands for answers about the closure, and officials with the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey being subpoenaed to testify about the matter. The Port Authority operates the bridge, which connects Upper Manhattan and Fort Lee.



Democrats have alleged the closure of two of three local access lanes from Sept. 9-13 was political retribution for Fort Lee's Democratic mayor failing to endorse Christie, a Republican, for re-election last month.
