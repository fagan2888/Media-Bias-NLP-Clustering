It applies to illegal immigrants who were brought to the U.S. before age 16. While it does not make them legal U.S. citizens, it puts off deportation and allows them to be legally employed. In some places, they are even allowed to receive in-state tuition rates at state colleges.\n\nIn New York, some professional licenses were previously only available to people who are U.S. citizens or have legal immigration status. The new policy allows those with DACA to be licensed as long as they meet all the license\u2019s educational requirements.\n\n\n\nAttorney General Eric Schneiderman called the Regents' decision \"another critical step toward addressing our broken immigration system.\"\n\n\n\nH/T Fox News", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "CNS News", "description": "New York will allow some illegal immigrants to teach and practice medicine throughout the state beginning June 1, the Associated Press reported.", "title": "New York State Will Let Some Illegal Aliens Teach, Practice Medicine", "url": "http://cnsnews.com/blog/melanie-hunter/new-york-state-will-let-some-illegal-aliens-teach-practice-medicine", "image": "//cdn.cnsnews.com/doctor.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-05-19T10:20:01-04:00", "type": "article"}, "article": {"published_time": "2016-05-19T10:20:01-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-05-19T10:20:01-04:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "New York will allow some illegal immigrants to teach and practice medicine throughout the state beginning June 1, the Associated Press reported.", "title": "New York State Will Let Some Illegal Aliens Teach, Practice Medicine", "url": "http://cnsnews.com/blog/melanie-hunter/new-york-state-will-let-some-illegal-aliens-teach-practice-medicine", "image": {"src": "http://cdn.cnsnews.com/doctor.jpg"}, "site": "@cnsnews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "description": "New York will allow some illegal immigrants to teach and practice medicine throughout the state beginning June 1, the Associated Press reported.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "(AP Photo)New York will allow some illegal immigrants to teach and practice medicine throughout the state beginning June 1, the Associated Press reported.\nIt applies to illegal immigrants who were brought to the U.S. before age 16.\nIn New York, some professional licenses were previously only available to people who are U.S. citizens or have legal immigration status.\nThe Obama administration implemented the DACA policy in 2012.\nThe new policy allows those with DACA to be licensed as long as they meet all the license\u2019s educational requirements."}
