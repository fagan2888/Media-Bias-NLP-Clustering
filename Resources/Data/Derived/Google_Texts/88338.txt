THE WHITE HOUSE is irritated with you. The N.Y. Times calls to profile you. Do you cooperate? – B’DAYS: Addie Whisenant, Dominique Mann

By Mike Allen ( mallen@politico.com, @mikeallen), with Daniel Lippman ( dlippman@politico.com; @dlippman)

THE BUZZ: Jason Horowitz, the scalpel-wielding profile/features writer in the N.Y. Times Washington bureau, is profiling David Krone, chief of staff to Harry Reid. Krone strained relations with the White House when a front-page WashPost tick-tock the morning after midterms quoted Krone on the record as saying POTUS could have been more financially helpful to embattled Senate Dems: “We were never going to get on the same page. ... We were beating our heads against the wall.” Will Jason have a kiss for Krone, as a D.C. truth-teller? Or will he throw a dagger like he did at Robert Gibbs?

Story Continued Below

--LOOK FOR KRONE to sit down with Horowitz, according to Capitol Hill sources. Friends say Krone didn’t want to engage. But Jason was so persistent, and called so many people, that the chief is likely to give an interview, trusting Jason to be fair.

--WHAT KRONE can be expected to say about the post-mortem: Krone believed the White House had shot first. The Post had been chasing Krone, who kept declining to talk. Then, just before the election, the reporter emailed to recount what the White House had said about Krone and the caucus. DSCC Executive Director Guy Cecil was hearing similar things. So Krone and Adam Jentleson, Reid’s communications director, met with The Post. Krone responded to quotes from the White House. Thus the detonation.

SCOOP DU JOUR --“Harry Reid wants Warren in Senate leadership,” by Manu Raju and John Bresnahan: “The incoming Senate minority leader, Harry Reid, is engaged in private talks with the Massachusetts freshman to create a special leadership post for the former Harvard professor ... It’s unclear exactly what the new job would entail — but luring the populist liberal into leadership could inject fresh blood into a team reeling from significant midterm election losses. Adding Warren ... would bring in a nationally known name who could help sharpen the Democratic message as it goes toe-to-toe with the new Senate Republican majority.” http://politi.co/11jZSRk

--“A Behind-The-Scenes Peek Inside The Mitch McConnell Legacy Vault” -- ABC News’ Jeff Zeleny: “It’s McConnell like we’ve rarely seen him before. From a childhood affliction with polio, to his audacious first bid for the Senate in 1984, the stages of his life are on display at the McConnell Center at the University of Louisville.” 2-min video: http://abcn.ws/10ZrkCM

--“Battle for Darrell Issa’s [Oversight] gavel heats up,” by Jake Sherman: “Utah Rep. Jason Chaffetz, who is trying to leapfrog five more-senior members, and Ohio Rep. Mike Turner, who is No. 3 in seniority, have spent months furiously lobbying the members of the House Republican Steering Committee, which will meet next week to consider their cases. But all the lobbying may not matter. Boehner has five votes, his leadership team will follow him and vote in a bloc and the speaker has sway over most of the remaining votes ... As Boehner walked onto the House floor Wednesday night, he let out a loud laugh when a POLITICO reporter asked him who would be the next Oversight and Government Reform chairman. Republican leadership insiders are watching the race closely and think Chaffetz has a slight edge over Turner.” http://politi.co/1EFBWG6

INSIDE THE WEST WING – “The selling of Obamacare 2.0: TV’s out; hashtags are in,” by Joanne Kenen: “The second year of Obamacare enrollment starts Saturday, and the administration is launching a much more precise strategy that uses targeted digital ads, aims at specific demographics and leverages social media ... The hashtag #bornin88 did well the first year in getting 26-year-olds to sign up; expect a #bornin89 successor, aimed at people who turn 26 and can’t stay on their parents’ health insurance. Officials now know that radio spots are better for reaching Latino audiences in need of sign-up assistance.” http://politi.co/1qFi2CT

--“The best last choice: Loretta Lynch wasn’t Obama’s top pick [for AG]. The inside story of how she got the nod,” by Edward-Isaac Dovere and Josh Gerstein: “Maybe travel less, Obama told Eric Holder. Want to be home more with your wife and kids? Let’s work out your schedule to make that happen. Tell us what we can do to make the job work better for you. Just don’t leave. ... Lynch’s name ended up on a list from Holder of suggested replacements for both himself or for outgoing deputy attorney general Jim Cole. ... Lynch wasn’t Obama’s first choice. He wanted Kathy Ruemmler, his former White House counsel.” http://politi.co/1sHKp35

2016 -- “Why Wall Street Loves Hillary: She's trying to sound populist, but the banks are ready to shower her campaign with cash,” by William D. Cohan in Politico Magazine: “While the finance industry does genuinely hate Warren, the big bankers love Clinton, and by and large they badly want her to be president. Many of the rich and powerful in the financial industry—among them, Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein, Morgan Stanley CEO James Gorman, Tom Nides, a powerful vice chairman at Morgan Stanley, and the heads of JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America—consider Clinton a pragmatic problem-solver not prone to populist rhetoric. …

“The informal head of her informal Wall Street outreach effort ... is a finance executive she knows well—and recruited to work for her at the State Department. Tom Nides, 53, the Morgan Stanley executive, knows both New York and Washington intimately. Today he speaks with Clinton regularly and has begun to play the role of gatekeeper on Wall Street to her embryonic campaign. He also has been known to run interference between the Obama administration and the leaders of the Israeli government, in order to try to patch up their dysfunctional relationship.” http://politi.co/1v6Pwk7

--“The liberal media's not ready for Hillary: She has no viable opponent, so the liberal media is trying to create one,” by Maggie Haberman and Hadas Gold: “Absent a strong challenge to Clinton from the left so far, progressive media outlets are trying to fill the void — propping up [Elizabeth] Warren ... Jim Webb, the former Virginia senator who has made noise about running for president, and outgoing Maryland Gov. [Martin] O’Malley, the only one laying any groundwork toward a run. Even Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who styles himself a ‘Democratic socialist,’ is getting some play in an effort to avoid a coronation.” http://politi.co/1v5AQCv

--“ Hillary Clinton left out by liberal donor club,” by Ken Vogel: “Biden will join Sen. Elizabeth Warren and other leading progressives in addressing a closed-door gathering of elite liberal donors — a roster of speakers that notably doesn’t include Hillary Clinton. [It’s t]he annual winter meeting of the Democracy Alliance, a group of funders of liberal causes ... Biden is set to appear Friday night at a gala at the Newseum where donors and operatives will ‘toast the tremendous work of the progressive community and look ahead to the future we hope to build together.’” http://politi.co/1xvcqzV

-- “Mike Huckabee rebuilds political team with eye on another presidential run,” by WashPost’s Tom Hamburger and Robert Costa: “This week, Huckabee is leading more than 100 pastors and GOP insiders from early primary states on a 10-day overseas trip with stops in Poland and England. ” http://wapo.st/1v6QI6W

MIKE MURPHY QUOTE --N.Y. Times 1-col. lead, “ In Climate Deal With China, Obama May Set 2016 Theme,” by NYT’s Coral Davenport: “The architect of Mr. Obama’s climate change plan is ... counselor, John D. Podesta, who is likely to leave the White House next year to work as the chairman of Mrs. Clinton’s campaign. ... 'They’re giving Republicans fertile ground for attack,’ said Mike Murphy, a longtime Republican strategist. 'Overregulation is clearly a job killer and jobs and the economy and middle-class wages are going to be a huge issue in the 2016 presidential. And it does seem like an inside job, with Podesta setting up Hillary’s position.’” http://nyti.ms/1v5zBTP

MEDIAWATCH -- “Can Fareed Zakaria Survive A Plagiarism Firestorm?” by The Daily Beast’s Lloyd Grove: “Imperially slim and darkly handsome, possessed of an insinuating charm and a cultured manner of speech that recalls the British Raj, he’s a prized dinner guest in Upper East Side salons, and an occasional adviser on world affairs to President Obama. ... [But] due largely to the relentless, three-month inquisition of [two anonymous bloggers], who have dissected Zakaria’s oeuvre and accused him of multiple instances of plagiarism—various marquee media outlets where Zakaria has written have slapped dire warnings on his archived pieces. ... Zakaria—... is said ... to be much-aggrieved by the recent pile-on, privately arguing that he’s the victim of vicious pedantry, and that his lapses are trivial and, at worst, journalistic misdemeanors of the sort that generally pass without notice at the country’s most respected publications.” http://thebea.st/1qEZClE
