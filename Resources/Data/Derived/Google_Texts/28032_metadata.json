Lunde is vying for the opportunity to represent Iowa\u2019s 4th Congressional District, which includes Ames and Story County.\n\nLunde, a Harvard Law graduate and Army veteran, said his decision to challenge King came about after King failed to acknowledge some ideas Lunde had for the country.\n\n\u201cI drafted these constitutional amendments, and I asked him several different times to introduce them in Congress and he didn\u2019t do it. He didn\u2019t even reply to my requests,\u201d Lunde said.\n\nThe 12 amendments that Lunde drafted and sent to King include plans to stop deficit spending by the government, balance the budget without an income tax increase, make Social Security permanent, modernize the courts and repeal the mandates in the Affordable Care Act while leaving the sections dealing with pre-existing conditions and allowing young people to stay on their parents\u2019 health insurance.\n\nThis is not the first time Lunde has ran for office, including a run for the senate in 2014 and two campaigns for the same congressional seat that he is seeking now in 1988 and 1992.\n\nCurrently, Lunde is collecting the necessary signatures to get his name on the ballot for the 2016 election. Lunde said he is a long way away from the 1,866 signatures required, but he said he will keep going until the mid-March cutoff date for candidates.\n\n\u201cI have several hundred but I don\u2019t have anywhere near 1,866,\u201d Lunde said.\n\nHe added that he sent nominating petitions to the GOP county leaders of the district in an attempt to gain more signatures at the Iowa caucuses next month.\n\nLunde may face an uphill battle while taking on King in the GOP primaries, but he said he thinks the people of the district will support his views when they hear his message.", "article_metadata": {"description": "U.S. Congressman Steve King, R-Iowa, will face strong competition from the left as he campaigns for re-election this year, but it might surprise Republican voters to find out that he is also being challenged by a member of his own political party.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Austin Harrington, Staff Writer aharrington@amestrib.com", "og": {"site_name": "Ames Tribune", "description": "U.S. Congressman Steve King, R-Iowa, will face strong competition from the left as he campaigns for re-election this year, but it might surprise Republican voters to find out that he is also being challenged by a member of his own political party.", "title": "Lunde to challenge King for congressional seat", "url": "http://amestrib.com/news/lunde-challenge-king-congressional-seat", "image": "http://amestrib.com/sites/amestrib.com/smtheme/_img/site-logo.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://amestrib.com/news/lunde-challenge-king-congressional-seat", "creator": "@AmesTribNews", "description": "U.S. Congressman Steve King, R-Iowa, will face strong competition from the left as he campaigns for re-election this year, but it might surprise Republican voters to find out that he is also being challenged by a member of his own political party.", "title": "Lunde to challenge King for congressional seat"}, "al": {"web": {"should_fallback": "true"}, "android": {"url": "ames-tribune://?eid=1379813", "app_name": "ames-tribune", "package": "com.stephensmedia.amestribune"}, "ios": {"url": "ames-tribune://?eid=1379813", "app_store_id": 552175169, "app_name": "ames-tribune"}}, "keywords": "News,Ames and Story County,", "article": {"published_time": "2016-01-13T21:40:26-06:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=0.9"}, "article_summary": "Lunde, a Harvard Law graduate and Army veteran, said his decision to challenge King came about after King failed to acknowledge some ideas Lunde had for the country.\nLunde is vying for the opportunity to represent Iowa\u2019s 4th Congressional District, which includes Ames and Story County.\nPaul Lunde, an Ames attorney and author of four books, has announced his plans to run against King in the Republican primary that will take place later this year.\nCurrently, Lunde is collecting the necessary signatures to get his name on the ballot for the 2016 election.\nLunde may face an uphill battle while taking on King in the GOP primaries, but he said he thinks the people of the district will support his views when they hear his message."}
