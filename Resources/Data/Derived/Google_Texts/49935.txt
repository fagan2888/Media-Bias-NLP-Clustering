Four lanes of Interstate 25 were closed Saturday morning as emergency workers deal with an accident in which a cement truck toppled onto its side onto another car, according to police.

The accident happened just south of the Belleview exit in Greenwood Village at 9:51 a.m., Sgt. Mark Stadterman of the Greenwood Village police said.

The cement truck driver was taken to a hospital with minor injuries, Stadterman said.

The driver of a white Toyota Prius was not injured.

Two large tow trucks were called to the scene.

“The traffic is quite a mess,” Stadterman said.
