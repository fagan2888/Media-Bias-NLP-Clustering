Far less attention has been paid to how little the new health law accomplished in fulfilling its advocates' promises to boost the growth of small business and new entrepreneurial start-up firms.\n\nBack in the summer of 2009, the Obama administration claimed the proposed health care legislation would allow small firms to choose among more plans to provide better coverage at lower costs. The new law also was supposed to assist individuals in finding and paying for insurance coverage if they decided to launch their own companies.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (even after losing her House majority and Speaker position in November 2010) renewed her promise,in March 2012, saying, \"you want to be self-employed, if you want to start a business, you want to change jobs, you no longer are prohibited from doing that because you can't have access to health care.\"\n\nAn Urban Institute analysis in May 2013 projected that by the end of 2014, the number of self-employed people in the U.S. would be 1.5 million higher (an 11-percent nationwide increase) due to the new law's reforms like guaranteed issue and tax credits for individual market coverage.\n\n[SEE: Political Cartoons on Obamacare]\n\nThe actual evidence regarding the health law's effects is far less rosy. The Bureau of Commerce reports that new business formation inched up slightly for a few years from its low point in 2010 \u2013 after four years of decline. But its 2013 figure of 406,000 new businesses remains far below the recent pre-recession peak number of 560,000 in 2006.\n\nSimilar measures of entrepreneurial activity by the Kauffman Foundation find modest evidence of recent upticks, but levels still below historical norms.\n\nClearly, more significant policy levers beyond health care, such as those involving taxes, access to credit and other areas of regulation, help shape the environment for formation of new high-growth businesses. But Obamacare's backers oversold the law's promises on this front.\n\nIn particular, two key mechanisms of Obamacare that were touted as providing substantial relief to businesses and start-up firms have failed miserably thus far.\n\nThe health law's tax credits for small businesses that provide health coverage drew very limited interest and participation. A Government Accountability Office review found that the tax credit was not large enough to incentivize employers to offer insurance or to make that insurance more affordable. The temporary and complex nature of the tax credits further diminished their attractiveness.\n\n[SEE: Political Cartoons on the Economy]\n\nObamacare's Small Business Health Options Program, or \"SHOP\" exchanges, also failed to provide a broader range of affordable and attractive choices of insurance for small businesses. The Congressional Budget Office originally projected that 2 million employees would enroll in such coverage starting in 2014, with the number eventually leveling off at 4 million in 2017. Although actual enrollment data has been hard to find, the best estimates are by GAO \u2013 about 76,000 individuals in state-based SHOPs as of June 2014 \u2013 and by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services \u2013 approximately 85,000 Americans covered through all SHOP marketplaces as of May 2015.\n\nThis category of health insurance exchanges aimed at serving small-business employers was hampered by delayed implementation of several promised features (online enrollment, employee choice), as well as transitional grandfathered relief provided for other types of coverage when initial implementation of the primary type of Obamacare exchanges \u2013 for individual market coverage \u2013 faltered in the fall of 2013. GAO also concluded that average SHOP-plan premiums were likely to remain similar to prices for non-SHOP plans. Hence, no competitive advantage on that front.\n\nBeyond moving closer to equal tax treatment of health insurance purchases across all types of buyers, simplifying and streamlining federal rules for small-group health insurance requirements and trying to make some other variety of health insurance exchanges work better, the potential for health policy reforms per se to boost growth of small businesses and entrepreneurial start-ups remains quite limited. Broader reforms must reach well beyond health policy to be more effective in this area. They primarily involve improving the overall economic climate in which new and younger businesses operate so that their opportunities to succeed and grow larger are better.", "article_metadata": {"zone": "homepage/articles", "keyword": "Economic Intelligence [Opinion]", "title": "Obamacare Hasn't Fulfilled Promises to Small Businisses and Entrepreneurs", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "Health care reform hasn't boosted the growth of small businesses and entrepreneurs like the Obama administration promised.", "title": "Obamacare's Small Business Bust", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/opinion/economic-intelligence/articles/2016-03-03/obamacare-hasnt-fulfilled-promises-to-small-businisses-and-entrepreneurs", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/00/202a88e6d38fec7d4332d0edf56bb6/555-104", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@USNews", "description": "Health care reform hasn't boosted the growth of small businesses and entrepreneurs like the Obama administration promised.", "card": "summary", "title": "Obamacare Hasn't Fulfilled Promises to Small Businisses and Entrepreneurs"}, "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "site": "opinion", "date_published": "March 3, 2016", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "Tom Miller,economy,Affordable Care Act,health care,small business,health care reform,entrepreneurship,Economic Intelligence [Opinion]", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Health care reform hasn't boosted the growth of small businesses and entrepreneurs like the Obama administration promised."}, "article_summary": "The health law's tax credits for small businesses that provide health coverage drew very limited interest and participation.\nThe new law also was supposed to assist individuals in finding and paying for insurance coverage if they decided to launch their own companies.\n[SEE: Political Cartoons on Obamacare]The actual evidence regarding the health law's effects is far less rosy.\n[SEE: Political Cartoons on the Economy]Obamacare's Small Business Health Options Program, or \"SHOP\" exchanges, also failed to provide a broader range of affordable and attractive choices of insurance for small businesses.\nFar less attention has been paid to how little the new health law accomplished in fulfilling its advocates' promises to boost the growth of small business and new entrepreneurial start-up firms."}
