Mary Pilcher-Cook \u201cshowed a complete disrespect for the body and its rules\u201d earlier in the week.\n\nPilcher-Cook, a Shawnee Republican, offered an amendment to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act during a Tuesday Senate floor debate about Medicaid drug reimbursement. Pilcher-Cook, an outspoken opponent of the ACA, or \u201cObamacare,\u201d wanted the Senate to vote it down decisively to send a message to House members that they should not vote on it.\n\nThe Senate\u2019s rules committee unanimously ruled the amendment out of order, but Pilcher-Cook challenged the ruling.\n\nThe senators then had to vote on whether to uphold the rules committee or support Pilcher-Cook in her efforts to kill Medicaid expansion.\n\nWagle said that put senators in an untenable spot.\n\n\u201cIn bringing her amendment the way she did, Sen. Pilcher-Cook chose to flout the rules of the Senate,\u201d Wagle said. \u201cOther senators, concerned that they would be depicted as supporting Obamacare if they voted to uphold the rules, felt compelled to vote in favor of Sen. Pilcher-Cook\u2019s illegitimate amendment.\u201d\n\nFor her part, Pilcher-Cook released a statement blasting the decision to remove her as chairwoman and Wagle\u2019s leadership in general.\n\nPilcher-Cook said Wagle was playing politics in betrayal of conservatives, comparing her to former U.S. House Speaker John Boehner and former Kansas Senate President Steve Morris, a moderate Republican whose leadership chafed the chamber\u2019s more right-wing members.\n\n\u201cInstead of allowing members to stand on principle and vote their conscience, she seeks to push conservative principles aside and push her own political agenda,\u201d Pilcher-Cook said.\n\nPilcher-Cook accused Wagle of wanting to enact Medicaid expansion.\n\nWagle strongly denied that, but she also promised that the Senate would vote on expansion within the next few weeks \u201cso there can be no question of where the Kansas Senate stands on this issue.\u201d\n\nWagle said Wichita Republican Sen. Michael O\u2019Donnell would replace Pilcher-Cook as chair of the Senate Public Health and Welfare Committee on an interim basis. Sen. Elaine Bowers, a Republican from Concordia, will be vice chair.\n\nMedicaid expansion would provide health insurance to an estimated 150,000 Kansans and draw down hundreds of millions in federal funds for health care providers. Opponents of expansion say it will be costly to the state and discourage work.\n\nThe House has also had political jockeying related to Medicaid expansion this year. Before the session started, House Speaker Ray Merrick, an expansion opponent, removed three expansion supporters from the House Health and Human Services Committee.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Government", "description": "From KHI News Service: A spat over Medicaid expansion and Senate rules caused the leader of the Kansas Senate to replace the chairwoman of the Senate", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://kmuw.org/post/kansas-senate-health-committee-chairwoman-pilcher-cook-ousted", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/kmuw/files/styles/medium/public/201602/mary_pilcher_cook.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "From KHI News Service: A spat over Medicaid expansion and Senate rules caused the leader of the Kansas Senate to replace the chairwoman of the Senate", "title": "Kansas Senate Health Committee Chairwoman Pilcher-Cook Ousted"}, "story_id": 466825195, "twitter": {"site": "@kmuw", "card": "summary", "creator": "@kmuw"}, "author": "Andy Marso, Abigail Wilson", "org_id": 0, "dc": {"title": "Kansas Senate Health Committee Chairwoman Pilcher-Cook Ousted"}, "nid": 63495, "datePublished": "2016-02-15", "keywords": "Medicaid expansion, Mary Pilcher-Cook, 2016 legislative session", "wordCount": 505, "has_audio": 1, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd037d\"", "article_summary": "From KHI News Service:A spat over Medicaid expansion and Senate rules caused the leader of the Kansas Senate to replace the chairwoman of the Senate Public Health Committee on Friday.\nBefore the session started, House Speaker Ray Merrick, an expansion opponent, removed three expansion supporters from the House Health and Human Services Committee.\n\u201cIn bringing her amendment the way she did, Sen.
