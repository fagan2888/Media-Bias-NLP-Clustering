Donald Lassere was elected chairman of the commission that oversees the Louisville Convention & Visitors Bureau.

Donald Lassere, president and CEO of the Muhammad Ali Center, has been elected chairman of the commission that oversees the Louisville Convention & Visitors Bureau.

Lassere had been serving as interim chair of the tourism-promotion agency’s board since the recent death of Michael Howerton, general manager of the Louisville Downtown Marriott.

Also at a recent Louisville Convention Commission meeting, Jim O’Malley, director of corporate affairs for Brown-Forman Corp., was elected the panel’s vice chairman.

Karen Williams, the convention bureau president, CEO and its top staff officer, said that Lassere “brings a strong background of leadership to our organization. His insight from leading one of our signature attractions will be an asset, as we continue to market Louisville as a world-class destination.”

She said that having Lassere and O’Malley at the helm will enhance the organization’s effort “to support the economic development goals of Louisville tourism in a vibrant time of growth.”

The commission is the policy-making body of the Louisville Convention Bureau, the community’s tourism marketing organization. Its members are appointed by Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer.

Since its creation in 1968 the bureau has tried to promote and sell Louisville as a destination for conventions, trade shows, corporate meetings and pleasure and business travel.
