That was the alarming suggestion Fox Business Network viewers heard Tuesday evening.\n\n\n\nTalking about the bewildering decision to trade five \u201chigh risk\u201d Taliban leaders for Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl on Lou Dobbs Tonight, psychology expert Dr. Gina Loudon said she has become \u201cvery, very concerned\u201d that President Obama has become \u201cirrational, erratic and perhaps not exactly what we might want to deem sane.\u201d [Video and transcript after the jump.]\n\nHost Lou Dobbs asked Loudon about the case of U.S. Marine Sgt. Andrew Tahmooressi, who is currently imprisoned in Mexico after accidentally crossing the border March 31 with guns in his vehicle, a case which seems much less urgent to the Obama administration than that of Bowe Bergdahl.\n\n\n\nBut instead of talking about the Tahmooressi case, Loudon made the much more disturbing observation that Obama is exhibiting signs of \u201cirrational\u201d behavior:\n\n\n\nDOBBS: The President hasn\u2019t mentioned a word about Sgt. Tahmooressi held in a Mexican prison. Your thoughts on the distinction here between the two, in at least Obama\u2019s mind?\n\n\n\nDr. LOUDON: You know, I will say to you, Lou, I am very, very concerned about the mental stability of this President at this point. Some of his behavior seems irrational to me. It seems beyond that of just a typical narcissistic, arrogant, sort of, \u2018I\u2019m a leader of a big country and I feel tyrannical at the moment\u2019 kind of attitude. It really seems to me like this President is demonstrating behavior that is not only anti-American, but irrational and erratic and perhaps not exactly what we might want to deem sane.\n\n\n\nAccording to her bio on her network\u2019s Web site, Loudon is the host of a 4pm show on \u201cMoney Business Life Network.\u201d Here\u2019s the blurb for that:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "NewsBusters", "description": "Forget about Barack Obama\u2019s ultra-liberal policies \u2014 should Americans now be worried about the mental health of the current occupant of the White House?
