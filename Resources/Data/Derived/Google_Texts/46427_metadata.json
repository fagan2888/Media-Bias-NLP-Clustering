Two of the emails presented questions that I decided to pose to the magazine\u2019s editor, Jake Silverstein.\n\nReader question from Rand R. Cooper:\n\nI\u2019m wondering about the cover piece of the June 14 NYT Magazine, \u201cLabor\u2019s Last Stand,\u201d by Dan Kaufman. Methodically it assembles a persuasive case (to me, anyway) for the importance of defending unions, and for the cynicism and wrongheadedness of Scott Walker and others who are trying to dismantle them.\n\nI understand that an article in the magazine is a feature and doesn\u2019t have exactly the same function as a news story in the daily paper. But I also know that The Times cherishes a practice and philosophy of impartial reporting, one that is being eroded on all sides amid the clash of partisan views that shapes today\u2019s journalism. Formally, \u201cLabor\u2019s Last Stand\u201d functions and reads like standard, traditional Times journalism. Yet it takes a passionate and committed stand. I happen to agree with that stand, but I\u2019m wondering: Is this advocacy journalism? And if so, does it represent the new normal for The Times?\n\nMr. Silverstein\u2019s response:\n\nThanks for your question. It\u2019s a perfectly reasonable one. To me, the answer lies in the distinction between a magazine story and a story produced by the newsroom for the daily paper. As you note, \u201can article in the magazine is a feature and doesn\u2019t have exactly the same function as a news story.\u201d The major difference is that magazine feature writing allows for a reasonable amount of a writer\u2019s subjectivity to be present in the formulation of a narrative. The magazine is extremely rigorous in terms of accuracy and fairness, of course, and it eschews direct argument (which is the province of Opinion); what it does best is tell stories, and all good storytelling is based on the teller having a perspective, a vantage on the events described. I absolutely don\u2019t believe that this is the same thing as advocacy journalism.\n\n*************\n\nReader question from Clay Steinman:\n\nThis seems quite the tendentious, anti-union picture to feature on the website and to put on the cover of Sunday\u2019s magazine. The image seems more like what I imagine Cindy Sherman might make (I believe she\u2019d decline) as a riff on a horror film still about unions as monsters if the Koch brothers were paying her to demonize union workers. Of course photographs can, do and should have points of view, and I can imagine that someone might have thought this represents a point of view promulgated by Scott Walker. However, it would be quite a leap to expect viewers to see a photo as a representation of a campaign prejudice without the clearest of captions. For anyone seeing this with mixed or anti-union feelings, the picture may well remain a visual symbol of what defenders of collective bargaining are really like.\n\nWhy would the magazine or the website promote such an anti-worker image? Pictures (especially journalistic pictures) have an aura of indexicality that no matter the stylization threatens to be taken as a sign of life.\n\nKathy Ryan, the magazine\u2019s photography director, writes in Sunday\u2019s \u201cBehind the Cover\u201d that the photo by Philip Montgomery \u201cevokes labor protests of the past.\u201d Perhaps in the theater (a production of \u201cWaiting for Lefty\u201d? \u201cThe Cradle Will Rock\u201d?). I wonder which labor protests Ms. Ryan attended that resembled the picture to human eyes, without benefit of the photographer\u2019s \u201ccinematic lighting and shadows\u201d \u2013 unmentioned on the magazine cover or on the displays on the web.\n\nMr. Silverstein\u2019s response:\n\nI differ pretty strongly from you in my thoughts about the images and what they convey. Yes, they are \u201chot\u201d images that show people in moments of passionate anger, but they don\u2019t demonize workers. The lighting is cinematic, but to me \u2014 and to Kathy Ryan, our wonderful director of photography \u2014 it doesn\u2019t evoke horror films. Rather, it creates a certain kind of dramatic intensity. And it\u2019s important to note that these are not staged photos. Philip Montgomery\u2019s style simply heightens what was actually taking place. More than anything, what he managed to capture is desperation, the feeling that a critical battle is being waged (and possibly lost). That tracks perfectly with Dan Kaufman\u2019s story and the language we used to describe it.\n\nThis is the latest in my series of Perfectly Reasonable Questions, where I pose readers\u2019 questions to Times editors and present the questions and answers without comment.
