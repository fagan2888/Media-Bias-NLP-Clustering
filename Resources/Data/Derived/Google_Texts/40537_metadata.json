The Rams\u2019 other lost fumble also was in the third quarter, when quarterback Nick Stevens was hit in the pocket by David Moala on CSU\u2019s first possession after the halftime intermission prolonged by a lightning delay. Kyler Fackrell made the recovery and returned it 12 yards to the CSU 8.\n\nIt led to a 23-yard Brock Warren field goal that put Utah State up 20-10.\n\nCSU\u2019s third turnover came with an asterisk, since Stevens threw a desperation toss into the end zone on fourth-and-goal on the second-to-last play of the game before the Aggies killed the clock with a kneel-down.\n\nLine shuffle. Left guard Zack Golditch, who suffered a sprained ankle in the Rams\u2019 win at Texas-San Antonio the previous week, wasn\u2019t expected to play but got in for a few series against the Aggies. Sophomore Trae Moxley, from Carbondale, started in Golditch\u2019s spot.\n\nDelays, delays. Both teams went through the long wait through the lightning delay at halftime, of course, but it also came after CSU had a prolonged travel day Friday, with the Rams\u2019 chartered flight from the Loveland-Fort Collins airport to Logan held up by weather issues in the area.\n\nThe traveling party arrived at its Logan hotel at 10:30 p.m., about 3\u00bd hours behind schedule.\n\nComing up. The Rams\u2019 loss in the former Romney Stadium came in the first game of a crucial three-week stretch of the CSU schedule. The Rams face Boise State and Air Force at Hughes Stadium on the next two Saturdays.
