The article, titled \u201cRubio may oppose Common Core but has supported the ideas behind it,\u201d lists several ways that Marco Rubio has supported the components of the Common Core system:\n\n\u2026while Rubio never advocated for Common Core, he was a proponent of the building blocks. Bush on Thursday noted that Rubio had supported Race to the Top, the federal program that incentivized states to adopt Common Core. \u201cI think that\u2019s a good idea,\u201d Rubio said in 2009. He did stress, however, that he felt \u201ceducation is a state function, best regulated and governed at the state level.\u201d That year Rubio also praised Obama\u2019s hire of Arne Duncan as education secretary, calling him an \u201cinnovator\u201d while praising the federal government\u2019s effort \u201cencouraging\u201d states to adopt curriculums \u201cthat reflect the 21st Century.\u201d Rubio\u2019s 100 Ideas book, a template for his tenure as House speaker, endorsed ideas such as more testing and a revamped curriculum. Idea No. 2 called for Florida to \u201csystematically and sequentially replace the Sunshine State Standards with a new, world-class curriculum comparable to those found in the leading education systems in the world.\u201d As Gary Fineout of The Associated Press pointed out Thursday, Rubio never asked state officials or Gov. Scott to stop Common Core from being adopted in Florida. (Amid the backlash, the state has simply whitewashed the words Common Core from official policy.) [See also Even Mainstream Media Question Scott\u2019s Statements about Being Out of Common Core]\n\nObviously, Race to the Top and Arne Duncan were the means the Obama administration used to impose and spread the Common Core that was aided by Bush and his Foundation for Excellence in Education, as Rubio correctly pointed out. Bush also took credit for the Common Core-cementing and Fed Ed-expanding Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), while Rubio, to his credit, voted against the initial Senate version. However, Rubio failed to vote against cloture or the final version of ESSA or the omnibus that increased funding for the tyrannical federal programs that are in ESSA.\n\nLeary clearly explains the damage that Bush\u2019s support of Common Core has done to his campaign:\n\nBush\u2019s support is clear as is the damage it has done to him in the presidential race.\n\nAlthough Rubio\u2019s record is far better than Bush\u2019s on the Common Core system, it is far from perfect. In addition to what is shown above, we have documented the major contributions to Rubio by Common Core billionaires Bill Gates and Paul Singer, and our friends at The Pulse 2016have shown that Rubio is pushing the invasive data mining bill, The Know Before You Go Act. This bill seeks to have the federal government collect data on students throughout their lives just to be able to provide information to others about which colleges and majors provide the best jobs. This contributed in large part to the Florida Senator\u2019s merely average grade of a \u2018C\u2019 on Common Core by American Principles in Action. Privacy expert Barmak Nassirian, Director of Federal Relations and Policy Analysis for the American Association of State Colleges, said:\n\nTracking autonomous free individuals through most of their lives in the name of better information for the benefit of others may be justifiable, but its extremism should at the very least be acknowledged and addressed.\n\nRubio has recently been echoing the strong opposition both to the Common Core (by criticizing Chris Christie) as well as talking about abolishing the U.S. Department of Education. Senator Ted Cruz has been forcefully stating these positions since at least 2011, according to Donna Garner, a long-time activist from Cruz\u2019s home state of Texas. Cruz was also the first candidate to sign Eagle Forum founder Phyllis Schlafly\u2019s pledge against Common Core. Ultimately, though, Rubio\u2019s opposition to the standards and the US DOE has not been as strong and long standing as that of Cruz and Kentucky Senator Rand Paul, both of whom received grades of \u2018A-\u2018 on the APIA report card.\n\nGarner also points out that although billionaire businessman Donald Trump expresses opposition to Common Core, he has given liberally to the politicians that put the terrible system into place:\n\nOur country needs to turn a deaf ear to Donald Trump\u2019s recent anti-Common Core comments. It is Donald Trump who used his vast wealth to give campaign donations and/or to support publicly the Democrats who perpetrated both ObamaCare and Common Core. These include Obama, Rahm Emanuel, Nancy Pelosi, Harry Reid, Hillary Clinton, Chuck Schumer, Charlie Rangel, John Kerry, and Bill Gates: 6.22.15 \u2013 \u201cHow Donald Trump Helped Democrats Pass Obamacare\u201d \u2014 by Marc A. Thiessen \u2013 Washington Post \u2014\n\nVoters need to be discerning in their choices especially when it comes to the freedom, futures, and privacy of their children.\n\nCross-posted at The Pulse 2016", "article_metadata": {"shareaholic": {"site_name": "Caffeinated Thoughts", "language": "en-US", "url": "https://caffeinatedthoughts.com/2016/01/a-closer-look-at-marco-rubio-record-on-common-core/", "article_author_name": "Karen Effrem", "image": "https://caffeinatedthoughts.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/marco-rubio-wcc-7-8-2015-dave-davidson-1024x683.jpg", "site_id": "965f58835b5900850067f65116487024", "article_published_time": "2016-01-26T21:22:44+00:00", "shareable_page": "true", "article_modified_time": "2016-05-26T05:30:14+00:00", "keywords": "chris christie, common core, donald trump, donna garner, every student succeeds act, jeb bush, marco rubio, phyllis schlafly, rand paul, tampa bay times, ted cruz, education, election central", "wp_version": "7.7.1.0"}, "description": "Karen Effrem:\u00a0Although Rubio\u2019s record is far better than Bush\u2019s on the Common Core system, it is far from perfect.
