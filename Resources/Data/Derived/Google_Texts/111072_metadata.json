At just over 4 percent, today\u2019s mortgages rates still remain extremely low by historical standards. In 2008, before the housing busts, rates were around 6.5 percent.\n\nRelated: The Hidden Risk of Home Equity Loans\n\nMillions of Americans have already taken advantage of the opportunity to refinance at record-low rates these past few years. Despite this environment, one in five households that could have refinanced in recent years had not done so, according to a recent paper published by the National Bureau of Economic Research. The cost to those homeowners: about $11,500 each over the life of the mortgage.\n\nIf you\u2019ve been procrastinating or if you\u2019ve only just gained enough equity to refinance, this may be your last shot.\n\nThe Fed\u2019s decision, combined with the economy\u2019s continued positive momentum, means the mortgage rate upward climb may not end anytime soon. The Mortgage Bankers Association predicts rates will reach 5.1 percent by the end of next year and 5.8 percent by the end of 2016.\n\n\u201cThe window for refinancing may not be open for that long,\u201d said Bill Hampel, chief economist of the Credit Union National Association. Homeowners are taking note: Nearly two-thirds of all mortgage applications last week were to refinance.\n\nRelated: 7 Pros and Cons to Refinancing Your Mortgage\n\nHere\u2019s how to figure out whether this move is right for you.\n\nRun the Basic Numbers\n\nUse a mortgage calculator to determine how much your monthly mortgage payment would change based on a new lower rate. Then factor in closing costs, which are typically 2 percent to 5 percent of the value of your mortgage.\n\nDivide the total amount of closing costs by the amount you\u2019ll save each month to determine how many months it will take to recoup your fees. If it will take less than three years, and you plan to be in your house for more than five years, it\u2019s probably a \u201cno-brainer\u201d to refinance, advises Hampel.\n\nThe decision is a bit trickier if it will take you longer than three years to break even. If you won\u2019t recoup your costs for six years \u2013 then refinancing probably doesn\u2019t make sense.\n\nRelated: Refinancing Before Retirement: It\u2019s Complicated\n\nConsider Other Factors\n\nWhat kind of mortgage do you have? If you\u2019re in an adjustable-rate mortgage and plan to stay in your home for a long period of time, it may be worth refinancing at today\u2019s rates to lock them in for the long term, even if it means making a higher monthly payment in the short term.\n\nRefinancing also often means resetting the clock on your mortgage. If you\u2019re decades into paying off a 30-year mortgage, you may not want to commit to another 30 years of housing debt, even if it\u2019s at a lower rate. You might consider instead a 15-year loan, which has a lower rate and higher monthly payments but will have you owning your house outright much sooner. \u201cThink about you particular situation not just now, but five, ten, twenty years from now,\u201d said Avani Ramnani, director of financial planning and wealth management at Francis Financial in New York.\n\nAnother incentive to refinance is the chance to merge loans. Refinancing lets you consolidate a second mortgage or a home equity loan with your home mortgage, which can save money by allowing you to pay one low rate on the entire amount, instead of a low percentage on your primate mortgage and a higher one on the other loans.\n\nGet Ready to Jump Through Hoops\n\nBanks are stilled scarred from the housing bust and are dealing with significant changes to the regulatory environment, so lending standards are much tighter than they were in the past. Even former Fed chair Ben Bernanke recently admitted to having had his mortgage refinance application rejected.\n\nTo get the best rate, you\u2019ll need excellent credit and lots of documentation of your income and assets. The average credit score for closed loans in September was 726, according to Ellie Mae.\n\nFinally, shop around. \u201cTalk to a big bank, talk to a little bank, talk to a mortgage broker,\u201d says David Reiss, a professor of real estate finance at Brooklyn Law School. The gap between the best and the worst mortgage deals can be as much as a full percentage point.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "After the Fed\u2019s announcement Wednesday that it would end its historic $3 trillion bond", "title": "This Could Be Your Last Shot to Refinance a Mortgage", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2014/11/07/Could-Be-Your-Last-Shot-Refinance-Mortgage", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/02162010_Mortgage_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2014/11/07/Could-Be-Your-Last-Shot-Refinance-Mortgage", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/02162010_Mortgage_article.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "After the Fed\u2019s announcement Wednesday that it would end its historic $3 trillion bond", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Run the Basic NumbersUse a mortgage calculator to determine how much your monthly mortgage payment would change based on a new lower rate.\nEven former Fed chair Ben Bernanke recently admitted to having had his mortgage refinance application rejected.\nAfter the Fed\u2019s announcement Wednesday that it would end its historic $3 trillion bond-buying program, mortgage rates predictably began to rise.\nThe Fed\u2019s decision, combined with the economy\u2019s continued positive momentum, means the mortgage rate upward climb may not end anytime soon.\nIf you\u2019ve been procrastinating or if you\u2019ve only just gained enough equity to refinance, this may be your last shot."}
