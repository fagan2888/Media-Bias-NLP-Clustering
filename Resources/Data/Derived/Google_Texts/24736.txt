Martin Mucci, Paychex CEO weighs in on the rebound in jobs last month.

Despite the worst January for the stock market since 2009, plummeting oil prices and concerns about an economic slowdown in China, U.S. small business hiring bounced last month, according to the Paychex-IHS Small Business Jobs Index.

The index, released Tuesday, rebounded 0.28 percent to 100.65 from December, matching the highest rate of small business hiring since May and offsetting the growth-rate declines of 2015. A reading above 100 indicates growth.

Marty Mucci, president and CEO at Paychex, said there was "nice growth" across the U.S., adding "most regions and states saw a bump up."
