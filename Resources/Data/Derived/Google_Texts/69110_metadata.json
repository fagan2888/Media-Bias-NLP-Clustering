It released a video featuring celebrities such as Jon Hamm, Questlove and Kerry Washington pledging to intervene before sexual assault occurs.\n\nThe CU video features local celebrities such as Chancellor Phil DiStefano and campus student government leaders Lora Roberts, Juedon Kebede and Chelsea Canada, among others.\n\nBuffs quarterback Sefo Liufau also appears in the 1-minute video.\n\n\"When you localize the message it helps its effectiveness,\" said campus spokesman Ryan Huff. \"It's one thing when you see a national celebrity in a public service announcement but when you see your chancellor, your student government leaders, your standout student athletes, it resonates. 'People around me are on board so maybe I should get behind this movement too.'\"\n\nVarious students, faculty members and administrators make cameos in the short video with phrases such as \"Never blame the victim\" and \"It's on us to make sure guys know that if she cannot or does not consent to sex, it's sexual assault.\"\n\nCampus leaders have been enthusiastically supportive of the \"It's On Us\" campaign as CU works to end sexual assault more locally. The Boulder campus has been under investigation by the U.S. Department of Education since last summer for potentially violating Title IX, the federal gender equity law that prohibits sexual assault.\n\nThe White House campaign shifts the conversation toward what men, bystanders and the community at large can do to end sexual violence. In the past, efforts have focused on what victims can do to protect themselves.\n\nThe White House says that campus communities need to create an environment where sexual assault is unacceptable and survivors are supported.\n\nHuff said the campus was \"inspired\" by the White House video, and decided to interview people across the university. He said he hopes other student groups and organizations will feel compelled to make their own videos to spread the word.\n\n\"We just hope that after people watch it, it inspires dialogue among their peers because ending sexual assault can't be solved by one person,\" he said. \"It's really something collectively all of us need to get behind.\"\n\nSarah Kuta: 303-473-1106, kutas@dailycamera.com or twitter.com/sarahkuta", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/cu-news/ci_26840415/cu-boulder-joins-national-movement-its-us-video", "sailthru.author": "By Sarah Kuta \n \n  Camera Staff Writer", "ag": {"canon": "BoulderDailyCamera:article:26840415:view"}, "startDate": "2014-11-01T13:00:00-0600", "twitter": {"domain": "dailycamera.com", "description": "Watch CU-Boulder's \"It's On Us\" videobit.ly/103OKGE\n\nThe University of Colorado has created a short video modeled after a White House public service announcement  that aims to end sexual assault on college campuses.", "title": "CU-Boulder joins national movement with 'It's On Us' video", "url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/cu-news/ci_26840415/cu-boulder-joins-national-movement-its-us-video", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2014/1031/20141031__02DCAITSw~1.jpg", "site": "@dailycamera", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "modificationDate": "2014-10-31T18:42:45-0600", "endDate": "2024-10-31T18:38:30-0600", "news_keywords": "CU News, CU News news, Boulder Colorado CU News news, Boulder Colorado news, CU News Boulder news, CU News Colorado news, US CU News news, world CU News news.", "byline": "By Sarah KutaCamera", "pubDate": "2014-10-31T18:44:06-0600", "sailthru.date": "2014-11-01T13:00:00-0600", "sailthru.title": "CU-Boulder joins national movement with 'It's On Us' video", "verify-v1": "TakAiHiDAOiNOP+m0YTx4DQeyjor+bTdc8e+pw6bDoI=", "sailthru.section": "CU News", "description": "Watch CU-Boulder's \"It's On Us\" videobit.ly/103OKGE\n\nThe University of Colorado has created a short video modeled after a White House public service announcement  that aims to end sexual assault on college campuses.", "sailthru.site": "dailycamera.com", "msvalidate.01": "9DAB14005AD5A9FFA4CA0EF58CC794BA", "og": {"url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/cu-news/ci_26840415/cu-boulder-joins-national-movement-its-us-video", "image": "http://extras.dailycamera.com/images/dailycamera3.png", "type": "article", "description": "Watch CU-Boulder's \"It's On Us\" videobit.ly/103OKGE\n\nThe University of Colorado has created a short video modeled after a White House public service announcement  that aims to end sexual assault on college campuses.", "title": "CU-Boulder joins national movement with 'It's On Us' video"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "867892b0357001538903740c75a206f0"}, "google-site-verification": "07CC1xPDVU0znu496XTAjLyC32Ylj8zwWHlmrzx3pgY", "y_key": "c9d9b53f7f5af674"}, "article_summary": "Huff said the campus was \"inspired\" by the White House video, and decided to interview people across the university.\nIt released a video featuring celebrities such as Jon Hamm, Questlove and Kerry Washington pledging to intervene before sexual assault occurs.\nWhite House campaign to end sexual assault on campuses launched in SeptemberWatch CU-Boulder's \"It's On Us\" video bit.ly/103OKGEThe University of Colorado has created a short video modeled after a White House public service announcement that aims to end sexual assault on college campuses.\nThe White House campaign shifts the conversation toward what men, bystanders and the community at large can do to end sexual violence.\nCampus leaders have been enthusiastically supportive of the \"It's On Us\" campaign as CU works to end sexual assault more locally."}
