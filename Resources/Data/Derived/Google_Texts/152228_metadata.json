Their protesting effectively shut down the company\u2019s operations for the day.\n\n\n\nofficial MintPress sponsor official MintPress sponsor\n\nThe activists, members of the \u201cCrunch Nestl\u00e9 Alliance\u201d, shouted out a number of chants, some which include \u201cWe got to fight for our water,\u201d \u201cNestl\u00e9, stop it, water not for profit,\u201d and \u201c\u00bfAgua Para Quien? Para Nuestra Gente.\u201d\n\nThose in opposition to what the company is doing stayed until 1 pm, but there were no arrests.\n\nThe activist adamantly claim that Sacramento City Hall has allowed Nestl\u00e9 to continue their actions via a \u201ccorporate welfare giveaway.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis corporate welfare giveaway is an outrage and warrants a major investigation,\u201d Coalition spokesperson Andy Conn stated. \u201cFor more than five months we have requested data on Nestl\u00e9 water use. City Hall has not complied with our request, or given any indication that it will. Sacramentans deserve to know how their money is being spent and what they\u2019re getting for it. In this case, they\u2019re getting ripped off.\u201d\n\nLola Ellis of 99 Rise Sacramento, who spoke on the bullhorn at the protest, said, \u201cNestl\u00e9\u2019s bottling of water in Sacramento is unsustainable in the current state of drought. We really don\u2019t\u2019 know how much water they are taking from the aquifer and that is a scary thing.\u201d\n\nShe continued, \u201cThe water needs to be used for the local community. If there is not enough water for the local community, the Nestl\u00e9 corporation should not be making a profit.\u201d\n\nOthers support Ellis\u2019 stance, rallying out of disbelief that such corporate greed could be allowed to continue when residents of the state are expected to run out of water within the next 12 \u2013 18 months if serious action isn\u2019t taken.\n\nRead the rest of the story at TrueActivist.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "As California suffers a record drought, local residents and activists took a stand to implore the company Nestl\u00e9 to stop its gluttonous guzzling of California's water for profit.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "AUTHOR": "Mint Press News Desk", "og": {"site_name": "MintPress News", "description": "As California suffers a record drought, local residents and activists took a stand to implore the company Nestl\u00e9 to stop its gluttonous guzzling of California's water for profit.", "title": "Activists Shut Down Nestl\u00e9 Plant In Drought-Stricken California", "url": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/activists-shut-down-nestle-plant-in-drought-stricken-california/204278/", "image": "https://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/nestle-protest.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-04-10T15:18:01-05:00", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "As California suffers a record drought, local residents and activists took a stand to implore the company Nestl\u00e9 to stop its gluttonous guzzling of California's water for profit.", "creator": "@MintPressNews", "image": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/nestle-protest.jpg", "title": "Activists Shut Down Nestl\u00e9 Plant In Drought-Stricken California", "site": "@MintPressNews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"admins": 100003161352196}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/MintpressNewsMPN", "section": "Daily Digest", "tag": "water shortage", "published_time": "2015-04-11T05:00:59-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-04-10T15:18:01-05:00"}}, "article_summary": "Activists Shut Down Nestl\u00e9 Plant In Drought-Stricken CaliforniaAs California suffers a record drought, local residents and activists took a stand to implore the company Nestl\u00e9 to stop its gluttonous guzzling of California's water for profit.\n\u201cFor more than five months we have requested data on Nestl\u00e9 water use.\nBut profit-driven company Nestl\u00e9 has yet to slow their bottling of plastic water bottles, guzzling 80 million gallons of water from Sacramento aquifers per year.\nofficial MintPress sponsor official MintPress sponsorThe activists, members of the \u201cCrunch Nestl\u00e9 Alliance\u201d, shouted out a number of chants, some which include \u201cWe got to fight for our water,\u201d \u201cNestl\u00e9, stop it, water not for profit,\u201d and \u201c\u00bfAgua Para Quien?\nThe activist adamantly claim that Sacramento City Hall has allowed Nestl\u00e9 to continue their actions via a \u201ccorporate welfare giveaway.\u201d\u201cThis corporate welfare giveaway is an outrage and warrants a major investigation,\u201d Coalition spokesperson Andy Conn stated."}
