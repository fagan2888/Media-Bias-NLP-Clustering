It\u2019s John Boehner. Boehner is Gruber. He\u2019s full of it,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s not doing his job representing an alternative vision for the country \u2026 It seems that he is cowardly. To me \u2026 he has an inordinate fear of being blame for a shutdown and no vision to inspire the rest of the country.\u201d\n\nPrior to voicing his view, Mr. Hannity played a video clip of Mr. Boehner talking tough about the president\u2019s executive actions, just two days after the midterm elections.\n\n\u201cJohn Boehner \u2018Grubered\u2019 conservatives tonight, and by that I mean, the conservative base in particular,\u201d Mr. Hannity said. \u201cAnd Michele Bachmann hit the nail on the head \u2014 he never would have done this before the election. He has no inspiring vision. And to me, he is everything that is wrong with Washington. He\u2019s a Democratic Party light.\u201d\n\nOf especial outrage to many conservatives was the fact the spending bill did not contain language that blocked funding for President Obama\u2019s executive actions on amnesty.\n\n\u201cIn my view, [Mr. Boehner] should not be the speaker,\u201d Mr. Hannity said, adding that he\u2019s pressed for two years for Mr. Boehner to step down. \u201cHe should be replaced.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Fox News host Sean Hannity ripped House Speaker John Boehner on his show Thursday for what he called a \"cowardly\" passage of a $1.1 trillion spending bill.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Fox News host Sean Hannity ripped House Speaker John Boehner on his show Thursday for what he called a \u201ccowardly\u201d passage of a $1.1 trillion spending bill.", "title": "Sean Hannity rips \u2018cowardly\u2019 John Boehner: \u2018He should be replaced\u2019", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/dec/12/sean-hannity-rips-cowardly-john-boehner-he-should-/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/12/11/boehner-congress-spendingjpeg-0a635.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/12/11/boehner-congress-spendingjpeg-0a635.jpg", "description": "Fox News host Sean Hannity ripped House Speaker John Boehner on his show Thursday for what he called a \"cowardly\" passage of a $1.1 trillion spending bill.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Sean Hannity rips \u2018cowardly\u2019 John Boehner: \u2018He shoul"}, "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Business Finance, Politics, John Boehner, Sean Hannity, Jonathan Gruber"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd05e0\"", "article_summary": "\u201cIn my view, [Mr. Boehner] should not be the speaker,\u201d Mr. Hannity said, adding that he\u2019s pressed for two years for Mr. Boehner to step down.\nFox News host Sean Hannity ripped House Speaker John Boehner on his show Thursday for what he called a \u201ccowardly\u201d passage of a $1.1 trillion spending bill.\n\u201cJohn Boehner \u2018Grubered\u2019 conservatives tonight, and by that I mean, the conservative base in particular,\u201d Mr. Hannity said.\nIt\u2019s John Boehner.\nBoehner is Gruber."}
