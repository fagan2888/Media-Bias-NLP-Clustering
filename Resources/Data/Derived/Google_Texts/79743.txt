Health savings accounts (HSAs) turn 10 years old on Sunday. Signed into law Dec. 8, 2003 by President George W. Bush, HSAs were established as part of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act and served as a replacement for medical savings accounts. Today, these accounts have become a popular and economical option for both employers and employees, as well as a key component of the trend toward consumer-driven health care.

According to Americaâ€™s Health Insurance Plans, 15.5 million people are covered by HSAs/high-deductible health plans (HDHPs). HSAs have seen steady and significant growth each year since their launch.
