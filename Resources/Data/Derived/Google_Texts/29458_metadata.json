But along with Syria\u2019s al-Qaida affiliate, the Nusra Front, it has established footholds in remote mountains along Lebanon\u2019s remote eastern border, from where it launches almost daily incursions further afield.\n\nJihadi recruitment in impoverished Sunni areas of northern Lebanon is on the rise, and black Islamic State group flags fly freely in some areas, reflecting pockets of growing support for the radical group.\n\n\u201cLebanon is in the eye of the storm,\u201d said Fadia Kiwan, a political science professor at Beirut\u2019s St. Joseph University.\n\nThe Lebanese are bitterly divided over Syria\u2019s civil war. Hezbollah fighters have gone to join Syrian President Bashar Assad\u2019s forces in their battle against Sunni rebels, drawing anger at home from Lebanon\u2019s Sunnis and stoking Sunni-Shiite tensions. This in turn led to tit-for-tat suicide bombings and several rounds of street clashes in Lebanon in the past year.\n\nThe Islamic State group threat first came to Lebanon in August, two months after the group\u2019s summer blitz in which it seized large swaths of territory in Iraq and Syria. In a surprise attack, Islamic State group and Nusra Front militants crossed over from Syria and overran the predominantly Sunni Lebanese border town of Arsal, hitting Lebanese army positions and killing nearly 20 soldiers.\n\nAfter weeklong clashes, the militants pulled back to mountain caves near Syria\u2019s border, taking more than 20 Lebanese soldiers and policemen with them.\n\nIslamic State fighters have since beheaded two Lebanese soldiers. Nusra Front militants have shot dead a third. In return for remaining hostages, they have issued various demands, including the withdrawal of Hezbollah troops from Syria, and the release of Islamists from Lebanese prisons.\n\nLebanese army commander Jean Kahwaji said in comments published this week that the militants from Syria want to ignite civil war and create a passage to Lebanon\u2019s coastline by linking the Syrian Qalamoun mountains with Arsal on the border and the northern Lebanese town of Akkar, an impoverished Sunni area.\n\nAnalysts agree that in Lebanon, the Islamic State group fighters also see an opportunity to strike at Hezbollah\u2019s patron, the Shiite powerhouse Iran but that they are not too eager to immediately embark on yet another war.\n\n\u201cThe territory of Lebanon is a longer-term goal,\u201d said David Schenker, director of the program on Arab politics at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy.\n\nBut there are fears that eventually, Schenker said, the Islamic State group could stage a spectacular bombing of, for example, the Hezbollah stronghold of Dahyeh south of Beirut, recreating an incident similar to a 2006 attack in the Iraqi city of Samarra, and \u201cunleash this incredible sectarian tension that results in a resumption of civil war.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Lebanon pulled into war with Islamic State group", "title": "Lebanon pulled into war with Islamic State group", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Lebanon pulled into war with Islamic State group", "title": "Lebanon pulled into war with Islamic State group", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/10/18/lebanon_pulled_into_war_with_islamic_state_group/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/10/mideast-lebanon-is-new-frontline.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Lebanon pulled into war with Islamic State group", "title": "Lebanon pulled into war with Islamic State group", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/10/mideast-lebanon-is-new-frontline.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Zeina Karam and Bassem Mroue", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe16ac\"", "article_summary": "Unlike in Syria or Iraq, the al-Qaida-breakaway Islamic State group does not hold territory in Lebanon.\nAnalysts agree that in Lebanon, the Islamic State group fighters also see an opportunity to strike at Hezbollah\u2019s patron, the Shiite powerhouse Iran but that they are not too eager to immediately embark on yet another war.\nJihadi recruitment in impoverished Sunni areas of northern Lebanon is on the rise, and black Islamic State group flags fly freely in some areas, reflecting pockets of growing support for the radical group.\nThe Islamic State group threat first came to Lebanon in August, two months after the group\u2019s summer blitz in which it seized large swaths of territory in Iraq and Syria.\nIslamic State fighters have since beheaded two Lebanese soldiers."}
