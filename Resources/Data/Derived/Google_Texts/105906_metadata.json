Gruber\u2019s assertion that opacity provided ACA proponents with huge political advantages had nothing to do with the question of whether the ACA statute provides for subsidies in every state. In that narrow sense, Klein is correct that the Gruber controversies are unrelated. But Obamacare's opponents are blending the two episodes into one because together they establish motive, means, and opportunity\u2014and thus a plausible excuse for conservatives to gut the ACA.\n\nTo do the right's bidding, the justices will need confidence that the public and the media won\u2019t perceive an adverse ruling in King v. Burwell as unwarranted or out of the ordinary. Never mind that the ACA debate was, in reality, the most transparent legislative processes in the recent history of big Congressional action. One of the people who helped make it possible says the opposite. And it\u2019s easier for the Court to do damage to an illegitimate law, or one built on a foundation of lies, than one that has achieved consensus.\n\nThe suggestion that the ACA benefitted from a lack of transparency actually serves the right in two ways. By reducing the public\u2019s faith in the law, yes, but also by allowing conservatives to treat every controversy surrounding it as effectively insoluble. Whatever the law\u2019s supporters and authors claim about the intent and meaning of the statute, the right no longer needs a fact-based response. They can instead deny the existence of a basic truth about the law because as Gruber suggests, the law was designed to hide the truth about itself. The scheme to compel states to set up their own exchanges was just another crude mechanism hidden within the text\u2014and when it failed, the Obama administration pretended it never existed.\n\nTaken together, this provides conservative elites the narrative they know they\u2019ll need to explain away a hugely controversial ruling.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean the Court will reach that ruling. And it doesn\u2019t mean the right alone is working the refs ahead of this case. But the claims the law\u2019s supporters make about King\u2014that it\u2019s flimsy, that it\u2019s a naked solicitation of judicial activism, that the stakes include the lives of people who have made irreversible treatment decisions based on a shared belief that their benefits were durable\u2014are all true. For the most critical patients, the proposed bait and switch is akin to granting public land to worthy recipients without telling them the water supply's been poisoned.\n\nBy contrast, the right's bid for control over the narrative is based on mythos and false piety and, now, the idea that the law itself lacks legitimacy. The challengers' claims about the ACA\u2019s meaning and intent are fabrications. Their appeals to humility are unctuous. And the law itself was hotly debated, passed by wide margins, signed, upheld by the Supreme Court, and ratified once again in a presidential election. It\u2019s also working as intended. If Congress held every significant bill to the standards of openness that it applied to Obamacare, it would amount to a massive, massive increase in legislative transparency. That\u2019s incontestable. And it makes the law as legitimate as laws get.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "//assets.newrepublic.com/assets/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "description": "In an otherwise excellent exegesis of the ongoing controversy surrounding Jonathan Gruber, Vox\u2019s Ezra Klein treats&nbsp;an infamous video in which the Obamacare adviser mocks the \u201cstupidity of the American voter\u201d&nbsp;as distinct from an earlier Gruber-related controversy, in which the MIT economist appeared to validate a legal challenge to the Affordable Care Act.&nbsp;The latter, in Klein's tell...", "og": {"site_name": "New Republic", "description": "It's all about helping the conservative justices avoid a backlash.", "title": "\"Grubergate\" Is Giving the Supreme Court Cover to Destroy Obamacare", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://images.newrepublic.com/05cdc32fb6083a1430d708485a276aae74838a62.jpeg?w=1109&h=577&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg", "url": "https://newrepublic.com/article/120299/gruber-obamacare-video-controversy-influence-king-vs-sebelius", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "It's all about helping the conservative justices avoid a backlash.", "creator": "@brianbeutler", "image": "https://images.newrepublic.com/05cdc32fb6083a1430d708485a276aae74838a62.jpeg?w=1024&h=512&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg", "title": "\"Grubergate\" Is Giving the Supreme Court Cover to Destroy Obamacare", "site": "@newrepublic", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#ffffff", "parsely-metadata": "{\"thumb_image\":\"http://images.newrepublic.com/05cdc32fb6083a1430d708485a276aae74838a62.jpeg\"}", "parsely-page": "{\"title\":\"\\\"Grubergate\\\" Is Giving the Supreme Court Cover to Destroy Obamacare\",\"link\":\"https://newrepublic.com/article/120299/gruber-obamacare-video-controversy-influence-king-vs-sebelius\",\"section\":\"Politics\",\"pub_date\":\"2014-11-17T17:54:00.000Z\",\"post_id\":120299,\"author\":\"Brian Beutler\",\"type\":\"post\",\"tags\":[\"Politics\",\"Obamacare\",\"Affordable Care Act\",\"Jonathan Gruber\",\"Supreme Court\",\"King v.
