The FDA was expected on Friday to announce the company\u2019s treatment, known as ferric citrate, would be approved for treating kidney patients with painfully high phosphorous levels.\n\nThen it did, and that\u2019s when the trouble began.\n\nIn its press release, Keryx noted what the FDA planned to include in its labeling information, and what many in the market believed to be a caveat: Since the medication was iron-based, doctors may have to re-evaluate intravenous iron therapy for their patients. These iron boosters often are necessary for those on dialysis with chronic kidney ailments.\n\nKeryx was hoping the iron-based characteristics of its medication \u2014 a distinguishing characteristic of the drug \u2014 would be seen as a positive, since it could help patients cut down on IV iron boosters. Instead, it left investors confused and \u2014 as Friday\u2019s and Monday\u2019s action indicated \u2014 downtrodden.\n\nShares were halted Friday as the company awaited word from the FDA, then spiked downward more than 12%. They ended the day off nearly 6%. Shares fell by as much as 12% again Monday and were down more than 11% in recent action to $15.10.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s grossly misunderstood and misinterpreted,\u201d Keryx Chief Executive Ronald Bentsur said in an interview with MarketWatch. Bentsur says the warning label tells doctors to monitor iron intake, but ultimately could help patients eliminate IV iron therapy altogether. IV iron use was cut by 85% in test patients, he said.\n\nStill, Wall Street apparently is as confused as investors. FBR Capital Markets analyst Dr. Andrew Berens downgraded shares to underperform from market perform, saying the labeling information would exclude a group of patients from being able to use it, and create uncertainty among others.\n\n\u201cAccordingly, we have adjusted our peak ferric citrate U.S. dialysis revenues down from $951 million to $476 million,\u201d Berens said in a note to clients.\n\nOther analysts, though, say the iron element is a plus for the treatment.\n\n\u201cThere is a clear economic benefit to dialysis centers for at least the next 10 years to advocate the use of ferric citrate and save themselves from having to spend more on [iron treatments],\u201d Brean Capital\u2019s Jonathan Aschoff said in his note.\n\nFollow @russbrittmktw\n\nFollow @MWHealthBlog\n\nMore must-read health coverage from MarketWatch:\n\nAverage Obamacare premiums will inch downward for 2015\n\nRecession\u2019s over, so look for health spending to accelerate again\n\nObamacare lifts hospitals\u2019 fortunes, reduces charity-care costs", "article_metadata": {"article.created": "2014-09-08T15:21:16-04:00", "application-name": "MarketWatch.com", "twitter": {"domain": "Marketwatch.com", "description": "Drug company takes unusual path of getting FDA OK for its drug, and seeing its stock drop", "title": "Keryx CEO says FDA warning label for drug is \u2018grossly misunderstood\u2019", "url": "http://blogs.marketwatch.com/health-exchange/2014/09/08/keryx-ceo-says-fda-warning-label-for-new-drug-is-grossly-misunderstood/", "image": {"src": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/MWimages/MW-CT250_pills__MG_20140902105852.jpg"}, "site": "MarketWatch", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.author": "Russ Britt", "article.section": "Markets", "keywords": "FDA approval,Keryx Biopharmaceuticals Inc.,kidney disease,shares drop", "article.headline": "Keryx CEO says FDA warning label for drug is \u2018grossly misunderstood\u2019", "msapplication-task": "name=SmartMoney;action-uri=http://www.smartmoney.com/;icon-uri=http://www.smartmoney.com/favicon.ico", "news_keywords": "FDA approval,Keryx Biopharmaceuticals Inc.,kidney disease,shares drop", "author": "Russ Britt", "article.page": "Health Exchange Blog", "description": "Drug company takes unusual path of getting FDA OK for its drug, and seeing its stock drop", "article.published": "2014-09-08T15:21:16-04:00", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "msapplication-tooltip": "MarketWatch", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.marketwatch.com/health-exchange/2014/09/08/keryx-ceo-says-fda-warning-label-for-new-drug-is-grossly-misunderstood/", "app_id": 283204329838}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/marketwatch", "image_count": 2}, "og": {"site_name": "Marketwatch", "description": "Drug company takes unusual path of getting FDA OK for its drug, and seeing its stock drop", "title": "Keryx CEO says FDA warning label for drug is \u2018grossly misunderstood\u2019", "url": "http://blogs.marketwatch.com/health-exchange/2014/09/08/keryx-ceo-says-fda-warning-label-for-new-drug-is-grossly-misunderstood/", "image": {"width": 569, "identifier": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/MWimages/MW-CT250_pills__MG_20140902105852.jpg", "height": 398}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Health Exchange", "article.id": "BL-MW243B-3060", "article.updated": "2014-09-08T16:09:18-04:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd315b\"", "article_summary": "Bentsur says the warning label tells doctors to monitor iron intake, but ultimately could help patients eliminate IV iron therapy altogether.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s grossly misunderstood and misinterpreted,\u201d Keryx Chief Executive Ronald Bentsur said in an interview with MarketWatch.\nIV iron use was cut by 85% in test patients, he said.\nKeryx was hoping the iron-based characteristics of its medication \u2014 a distinguishing characteristic of the drug \u2014 would be seen as a positive, since it could help patients cut down on IV iron boosters.\nShares were halted Friday as the company awaited word from the FDA, then spiked downward more than 12%."}
