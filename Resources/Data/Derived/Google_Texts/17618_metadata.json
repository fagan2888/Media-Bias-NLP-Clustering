But those savings would be more than offset by reversing the law\u2019s cuts to Medicare as well as its various tax increases, including a new levy on high-cost insurance plans, the agency said.\n\nIt also found that a repeal would boost economic growth by an average 0.7 percent over the next decade, while increasing the ranks of the uninsured next year by 19 million.\n\nRepublican reaction focused on the positive economic impact and played down the deficit implications.\n\nThe analysis is the first of the health care law under newly installed CBO Director Keith Hall, whom Republicans appointed in February amid complaints over how his predecessor had analyzed the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe projected budget hit of a repeal is actually bigger than what Hall\u2019s predecessor, Doug Elmendorf, had forecast. In 2012, the last time the agency considered the budgetary impact of repeal, Elmendorf said rescinding the law would increase the deficit by $109 billion over a decade.\n\nThe report comes as lawmakers, industry groups and others await a Supreme Court decision on whether to void some of the law\u2019s insurance subsidies, which could unravel much of the program.\n\nIn a statement, Senate Budget Committee Chairman Mike Enzi emphasized the report\u2019s findings on the economic benefits of repeal, while making little mention of the projected deficit hit.\n\n\u201cCBO has determined what many in Congress have known all along,\u201d he said. \u201cThis law acts as an anchor on our economy by dragging down employment and reducing labor force participation.\u201d\n\nThose on the other side of the divide over Obamacare cheered CBO\u2019s findings.\n\n\u201cAny way you slice it, repealing the Affordable Care Act will add hundreds of billions of dollars to the deficit,\u201d said House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi. \u201cRepublicans should look at the numbers and finally end their fixation with repealing this historic law.\u201d\n\nThe estimate will make it harder for Republicans to use so-called reconciliation to repeal the law because congressional budgeting rules bar lawmakers from using the parliamentary maneuver to move legislation that adds to government red ink.\n\nA repeal would save $1.15 trillion by canceling subsidies aimed at expanding health insurance coverage, the report said. But that would be more than offset by undoing cuts in payments to insurance companies, hospitals and others. That would increase projected spending by $879 billion. Canceling the law\u2019s tax increases, meanwhile, would reduce projected tax receipts by $631 billion, the CBO said.\n\nDumping the law would boost the economy by increasing labor participation, which jibes with what the CBO had found under Elmendorf.\n\nThe agency predicted last year that the law would reduce the labor force by some 2 million workers, in part because some people would quit their jobs if they didn\u2019t have to rely on employers for insurance. Also, the law phases out insurance subsidies for people who make more money, which CBO had said creates a disincentive to work. Economists call that effect an \u201cimplicit tax.\u201d\n\nCBO confirmed those findings today.\n\n\u201cThe subsidies and tax credits for health insurance that the ACA provides to some people are phased out as their income rises \u2014 creating an implicit tax on additional earnings \u2014 and those subsidies, along with expanded eligibility for Medicaid, generally make it easier for some people to work less and to stop working without losing health insurance coverage,\u201d the report said. \u201cRepealing the ACA would reverse those effects.\u201d\n\nCBO downplayed the differences between today\u2019s estimate and its 2012 forecast.\n\nFor one thing, the agency said, it\u2019s examining the law over a different period. The office analyzes a proposal\u2019s budgetary effects over a decade, which in 2012 was between 2013 and 2022. Now, it\u2019s looking at 2016 through 2025, when the law will have phased in more fully.\n\nAlso, health care costs are not growing as quickly as experts had expected, which means rescinding the Obamacare insurance subsidies is not projected to save as much money.\n\n\u201cThe changes in projections of per capita spending on health care have lowered the total cost for any given year of subsidizing coverage through the exchanges or Medicaid; correspondingly, the gross and net savings estimated to result from repealing the ACA\u2019s insurance coverage provisions are smaller,\u201d CBO said.\n\nRachana Pradhan contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "The CBO report comes ahead of a long-awaited Supreme Court decision on subsidies.\r\n&nbsp;", "title": "Price tag of Obamacare repeal: $353 billion", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/06/obamacare-repeal-congressional-budget-office-deficit-119228.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2015/06/19/150619_obamacare_gty_1160.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Obamacare,CBO,Republicans,Affordable Care Act,Congressional Budget Office", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "The CBO report comes ahead of a long-awaited Supreme Court decision on subsidies.\r\n&nbsp;", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca52b\"", "article_summary": "Story Continued BelowJunking President Barack Obama\u2019s signature health care plan would generate savings by ending insurance subsidies to millions of Americans, CBO said.\nCanceling the law\u2019s tax increases, meanwhile, would reduce projected tax receipts by $631 billion, the CBO said.\nA repeal would save $1.15 trillion by canceling subsidies aimed at expanding health insurance coverage, the report said.\nAlso, the law phases out insurance subsidies for people who make more money, which CBO had said creates a disincentive to work.\nAlso, health care costs are not growing as quickly as experts had expected, which means rescinding the Obamacare insurance subsidies is not projected to save as much money."}
