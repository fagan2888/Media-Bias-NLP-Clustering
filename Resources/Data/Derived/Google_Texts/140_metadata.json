And as you can see from this short video by Andrews, the fire is so intense that it turns purple as it rages.\n\n\n\nOfficials still are monitoring hot spots and flare-ups between Terlton and Cleveland and pockets of heavy smoke remain in the area on Friday.\n\nGiven the wind speed was averaging 45 mph during the height of the fire, the amount of damage incurred is much lower than it could have been, the emergency manager said.\n\nPawnee County officials say six homes and 6,000 acres burned. About 100 homes were in danger and evacuated on Thursday, according to emergency manager Mark Randell.\n\nThere have been no injuries reported from county residents, and the only setbacks were a couple of minor injuries to firefighters, Randell said.\n\n\n\nSeveral fire departments responded with mutual aid in the fire fight, and the massive team effort was led by the North 48 Volunteer Fire Department. The Oklahoma Forestry Service added relief by dropping nearly 60,000 gallons of water from an aerial tanker.\n\n\n\n2/18/2016 Related Video: Airplane Scoops Water From Arkansas River To Fight Pawnee County Wildfire\n\n2/18/2016 Related Story: Large Pawnee County Grass Fires Cause Evacuations, Shut Down Highways\n\n2/19/2016 Related Story: Firefighters Still Chasing Hot Spots In Pawnee County\n\nMore photos of the fire from The Cleveland American Facebook page here\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-17", "Description": "Dozens of area firefighters got up close and personal with a 6,000-acre wildfire in Pawnee County on Thursday.
