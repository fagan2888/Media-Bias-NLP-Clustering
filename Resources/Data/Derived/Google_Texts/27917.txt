Seeking to maintain pressure on Republicans, Barack Obama made a previously unannounced visit to FEMA's offices to draw attention to a government agency that has had to send home 86 percent of its workforce as part of the partial shutdown.

President Obama thanked FEMA employees, who are responsible for disaster reponse and preparedness, for their work in preparing for Tropical Storm Karen, which dissipated Sunday after posing a threat to the Gulf Coast.

To prepare for the storm, FEMA recalled 200 workers who had been sent home on unpaid leave last week following Congress' failure to reach an agreement over the federal budget.

Mr Obama said that now that the storm has weakened, at least 100 of those workers will have to return to what is known as furloughed status.

"That's no way of doing business," he said during a speech at the agency.

The Republican-controlled House of Representativies last week passed legislation that would continue to direct money to FEMA during the shutdown. But Democrats and the White House say they do not want to respond to the shutdown in a piecemeal, service-by-service fashion.

A defiant House Speaker John Boehner has insisted that President Obama must negotiate on changes to the Affordable Care Act and spending cuts if he wants to end the shutdown and avert a default.
