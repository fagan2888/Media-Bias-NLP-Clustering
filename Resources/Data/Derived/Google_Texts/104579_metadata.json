With a weather balloon and a leftover pastry, they decided to launch the first donut in space.\n\nAdmittedly, Alexander and Benjamin J\u00f6nsson probably have way too much time on their hands. Last week they launched their weather balloon, along with its sweet and tasty cargo, up into space from Askim in Norway. This is definitely taking the art of playing with your food to an entirely new level.\n\nSwedish brothers launch \u2018first donut in space\u2019 in Norway http://t.co/ZuQeyAPbxS #oddnews \u2014 Odd News UPI (@OddNewsUPI) April 15, 2015\n\nAccording to the Local, the weather balloon and donut went up to 32 km above the surface of the Earth and right to the very edge of space. What made the whole strange idea really interesting was that they filmed the whole process with an on-board camera.\n\nAccording to Alexander, they like to do odd things and, apparently, the idea to launch a donut in space felt \u201cvery different.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was really fun to watch the video for the first time. We could see the donut hovering above the Earth.\u201d\n\nAh, the latest in a series that will NEVER EVER GET OLD. Now it\u2019s a donut in space. http://t.co/TJoh2qmXxp pic.twitter.com/RJNZdo9S94 \u2014 Grey London (@GreyLondon) April 15, 2015\n\nBenjamin added that they wanted to do something unique, something no person has done in the past.\n\n\u201cWe have seen that people have sent things up before, but we established that no one had sent up a donut in space before. Then we thought, why not?\u201d\n\nAs reported on Bohusl\u00e4ningen (in the Norwegian language), the two brothers originally hail from Lysekil in Sweden, a little over the Norwegian border. However, according to Benjamin, it is cheaper to get flying permits in Norway, in fact it would cost them nothing, so they chose to launch the weather balloon and donut in space from Askim instead.\n\n\u201cIn Sweden it would have cost 11,000 Swedish kroner ($1,245), but it was free in Norway.\u201d\n\nThe brothers say in the description in the video included above that they spent many months planning this and are very happy with the outcome of the project.\n\nA few hours after the successful launch, the weather balloon crash-landed in Lake V\u00e4ttern in Sweden. Apparently some volunteers from the Swedish Sea Rescue Society salvaged the wreckage of the balloon along with some rather soggy remnants of the world\u2019s first donut in space.\n\nIt\u2019s just a real pity the donut in space can\u2019t tell us what it felt like to fly that high, but at least the two brothers achieved what is most likely a world first.\n\nMeanwhile, speaking of space, the Inquisitr recently reported that the so-called thigh bone that was said to have been found on Mars is probably a hoax. A donut in space is actually a far more likely phenomenon, it seems! Beam me up, Scotty \u2014 and don\u2019t forget the coffee.\n\n[Photo: Screengrab from YouTube video]", "article_metadata": {"description": "Two Swedish brothers wanted to go where no one has gone before.
