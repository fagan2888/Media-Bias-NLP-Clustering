Even for a president whose term will be defined by demonstrable lies, Monday’s whopper stood out for sheer brazenness.

In a nearly three-minute video released by the White House, President Obama declared that “one of my core principles is that I will never engage in politics in which I’m trying to divide people.”

“That’s not something I will violate,” he vowed.

In 2013, the “fact-checking” website Politifact called Obama’s “if you like your doctor you can keep your doctor” line the “lie of the year. This one went even further.

That has to be the lie of the century so far. Right? Does anything come close? https://t.co/m6uBCc6Ytj — RB (@RBPundit) June 1, 2015

Not something he will violate? Does the president — or his speechwriters — think someone other than the American public has been watching the news for the past six year? Reading the papers or cruising the Internet?

Or does he think that that those repeated party line votes in the battle for Obamacare during the disastrous two years that Democrats controlled both houses of Congress meant nothing? Does he forget — or does he think we forgot — the incident involving Harvard Professor Louis Gates (the one where the police “acted stupidly”) or how he and his attorney general deliberately fanned the flames of racial hatred in the country over the death of a thug named Trayvon Martin (the one who looked like the president’s imaginary son) who died committing a violent crime.

Or maybe that little matter of Ferguson, Mo., last August slipped his mind. Maybe he doesn’t remember sending three White House officials to attend the funeral of Michael Brown, another thug who died committing a violent crime.

Well, the president and his courtiers might not remember, but social media users do. And they found the president’s posting appalling.

@WhiteHouse@POTUS this is a statement he contradicts on a daily basis! ! — Daniel Mullen (@beantowm) June 1, 2015

It might be worse than that. He might actually believe it.

Be careful there. That would bring the 25th Amendment into play.

God has been good enough to keep Joe Biden from taking the oath for six years now, two more years will go by soon enough. Even if he is a lunatic.
