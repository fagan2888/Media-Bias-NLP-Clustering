A Southern Indiana county is facing a sharp increase in hepatitis C cases, but officials say it's too soon to seek state permission for a needle-exchange program.

Floyd County officials say they've seen a noticeable rise in hepatitis C cases tied to use of heroin and other drugs. County health officer Dr. Tom Harris told the Jeffersonville News and Tribune that the drug is inexpensive and easy to obtain in the area.

Sheriff Frank Loop says the county needs a drug addiction center. But recent budget cuts are raising questions about whether the county has the funding to deal with its drug issues.

Officials say the outbreak is troubling but hasn't yet risen to the level needed to seek state permission for a needle-exchange program under a new Indiana law.

In May, state health officials extended for another year a temporary needle-exchange program in Scott County meant to curb the spread of an epidemic where at least 160 people have been confirmed to have HIV.

A new law passed this year allows counties to ask the state health department for permission to operate a needle exchange program if they fear they are at risk of an HIV or hepatitis C outbreak. Counties must pay for the programs themselves.
