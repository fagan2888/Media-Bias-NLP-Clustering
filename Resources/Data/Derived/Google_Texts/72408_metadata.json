Board members rejected NJ Transit's proposal for a new insurance plan and the agency's plan to make employees responsible for half of excise taxes incurred as a result of the federal Affordable Care Act, coalition officials said.\n\n\n\n\"The Presidential Emergency Board, composed of three veteran, distinguished neutrals, has proposed terms that represent a reasonable compromise approach to settlement,\" Rail Labor Coalition officials said. \"We sincerely hope that New Jersey Transit will now take this opportunity to bring this protracted dispute to an end.\"\n\n\n\nThe coalition and NJ Transit now have until Nov. 12 to negotiate a voluntary agreement. If no agreement is reached by that time, either side or New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie can request a second Presidential Emergency Board, which will select \"the most reasonable offer,\" coalition officials said.\n\n\n\nThis recommendation would still be nonbinding, however.", "article_metadata": {"Description": "Railroad industry   news about: New Jersey Transit, New Jersey Transit Rail Labor Coalition, Presidential Emergency Board.
