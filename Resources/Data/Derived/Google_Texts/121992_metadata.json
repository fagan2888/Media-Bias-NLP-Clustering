Steven Crowder, conservative comedian and host of the podcast Louder with Crowder, said he believes that the Muslim bakers are well within their rights to refuse the cake-baking job \u2014 and so are Christian bakers.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not even saying these Muslim bakeries shouldn\u2019t have a right to do whatever they did \u2014 they absolutely should \u2014 and many more of them would than Christian bakeries,\u201d said Mr. Crowder in comments on the video.\n\nThis month\u2019s fierce national debate over religious-freedom bills, particularly in Arkansas and Indiana, has increased the attention on Christian-owned businesses, which suddenly find themselves the subject of intense and potentially ruinous media focus.\n\n\u201cThere is a witch-hunt now for Christian business owners,\u201d said conservative radio talk-show host Dana Loesch on her Thursday program.\n\nAlong with cheers from the right, the video has drawn a backlash from the left, where columnist Wes Williams of IfYouOnlyNews.com charged Mr. Crowder with being \u201chomophobic, AND racist,\u201d calling the expose \u201can attempt to smear Muslims.\u201d\n\nIn another post, John Paul Brammer of Blue Nation Review said the video only succeeds in underlining the point that anti-gay discrimination is widespread.\n\n\u201cAnyway, point taken, Crowder. There are bigots in every religion and we gay people should just consider ourselves lucky that we\u2019re not being lynched for being gay. Even though plenty of gay people have been lynched in this country, it\u2019s swell that it\u2019s not happening everyday anymore,\u201d said Mr. Brammer.\n\nWhile it may be tough to find a Muslim-owned bakery or florist in most U.S. cities, that\u2019s not the case in Michigan, home to a large Muslim community in Dearborn.\n\nIn the video, Mr. Crowder asks for a wedding cake with the message, \u201cBen and Steven forever.\u201d Some employees refer him elsewhere. One baker shakes his head and says, \u201cNo, no, I don\u2019t want it,\u201d apparently referring to the cake-baking job.\n\n\u201cMany of the Muslim bakeries were kind enough and willing to serve us, but many of them were not,\u201d Mr. Crowder said.\n\nMr. Williams argued that there has been no media coverage of Muslim bakeries because there have been no complaints filed against them, a point reinforced by Sommer Foster, political advocacy director of Equality Michigan, who said Friday she was unaware of any complaints.\n\n\u201c[T]he media, that he complains about, has been talking about a Christian bakery refusing to bake a cake for a same sex wedding, because that was the subject of several court cases,\u201d said Mr. Williams. \u201cIf a Muslim bakery somewhere has refused to bake a cake for a gay couple, that couple apparently didn\u2019t take the issue to court.\u201d\n\nThe Christian baker at the center of the court battle is Jack Phillips, owner of Masterpiece Cakeshop in Lakewood, Colorado. He was ordered in May by the state Civil Rights Commission ordering him to provide services for same-sex weddings, train his staff on anti-discrimination laws, and file quarterly compliance reports for two years.\n\nBut there were no complaints filed against Memories Pizza in Walkerton, Indiana, or florists in Jeff Davis County, Georgia. Still, both managed to garner unflattering media attention last week after reporters arrived to ask their Christian owners\u2019 opinions on the Religious Freedom Restoration Act.\n\nThe O\u2019Connors, who own Memories Pizza wound up closing their doors after angry criticism on social media in reaction to their statement that they would not cater a same-sex wedding ceremony \u2014 not that anyone had ever asked.\n\nMeanwhile, CNN\u2019s Gary Tuchman stopped by five Christian-owned florists to elicit their reaction to a RFRA bill in the Georgia legislature. Several workers, who were identified by name although their shops were not, said they would not serve a gay wedding for religious reasons.\n\nIn the two days since the report aired, the florists have come under heated criticism online. The Democratic Underground ran the headline, \u201cCNN story about Georgia flower shops that want to go out of business,\u201d while RawStory cited the florists\u2019 \u201creligious hypocrisy.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese flower shops are happy to do business with you, but not so much if you tell them you\u2019re gay,\u201d says Mr. Tuchman at the end of the segment.\n\nThat wasn\u2019t the case with Barronelle Stutzman, the Washington state florist who was sued in 2013 after refusing to provide floral arrangements for a gay wedding.\n\nShe had hired gay employees in the past and knew well the gay client who sued her \u2014 he had been coming to her shop for nine years, and she considered him a friend \u2014 but she had never failed to provide him with flowers until he asked her to serve his wedding.\n\nMs. Stutzman has appealed a court ruling against her after rejecting in February a settlement offer from the Washington Attorney General, who also filed a lawsuit against her. Ms. Foster said Equality Michigan would investigate a discrimination complaint \u201cno matter where the complaint comes from,\u201d referring to Muslim-owned bakeries, but that, \u201cWe don\u2019t go looking for instances of discrimination.\u201d\n\nVictor Begg, a founder and senior adviser to the Michigan Muslim Community Council, said U.S. Muslims are in general opposed to discrimination because they are often the targets of bias themselves. He added that opposition to gay marriage is rooted more in tradition than in religious doctrine.\n\n\u201cIn Islam, it\u2019s not sanctioned, that kind of marriage union,\u201d Mr. Begg said, referring to same-sex marriage. \u201cHowever, there is no real punishment prescribed.\u201d\n\nHe added that there are differences of opinion on same-sex marriage within the American Muslim community, just as there are within other religious groups.\n\n\u201cYou know, the Muslim community is no different than any other religious community. If you go to the Catholics, you\u2019re going to find different opinions,\u201d Mr. Begg said. \u201cIt\u2019s a controversial topic.\u201dMr. Crowder has not said whether he will take any action against the Muslim bakeries, although that seems unlikely, given his support for their right to refuse service. It\u2019s also possible that others may track down the bakeries.\n\nBut Ms. Loesch isn\u2019t counting on it. \u201cWaiting for the militant progressive supporters of gay wedding cake to start threatening and protesting these Muslim ran bakeries,\u201d she said in a Facebook post. \u201cI think we will be waiting a long time.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Muslim bakers and florists have flown under the media radar during the recent uproar over Christian-owned businesses and gay rights, but a hidden-camera video may have changed that.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Muslim bakers and florists have flown under the media radar during the recent uproar over Christian-owned businesses and gay rights, but a hidden-camera video may have changed that.", "title": "Video puts Muslim bakeries, florists in gay-rights spotlight", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/apr/5/video-puts-muslim-bakeries-florists-in-gay-rights-/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/03/27/0586aa0e88f1cb0d710f6a7067006f08.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/03/27/0586aa0e88f1cb0d710f6a7067006f08.jpg", "description": "Muslim bakers and florists have flown under the media radar during the recent uproar over Christian-owned businesses and gay rights, but a hidden-camera video may have changed that.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Video puts Muslim bakeries, florists in gay-rights spotlight"}, "Author": "Valerie Richardson", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Social Issues, Religion Belief, Dana Loesch, Steven Crowder, Wes Williams"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe26af\"", "article_summary": "\u201cMany of the Muslim bakeries were kind enough and willing to serve us, but many of them were not,\u201d Mr. Crowder said.\n\u201cI\u2019m not even saying these Muslim bakeries shouldn\u2019t have a right to do whatever they did \u2014 they absolutely should \u2014 and many more of them would than Christian bakeries,\u201d said Mr. Crowder in comments on the video.\nIn the video, Mr. Crowder asks for a wedding cake with the message, \u201cBen and Steven forever.\u201d Some employees refer him elsewhere.\n\u201cWaiting for the militant progressive supporters of gay wedding cake to start threatening and protesting these Muslim ran bakeries,\u201d she said in a Facebook post.\nCrowder has not said whether he will take any action against the Muslim bakeries, although that seems unlikely, given his support for their right to refuse service."}
