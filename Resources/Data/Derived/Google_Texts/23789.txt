NBC Nightly News anchor Brian Williams called President Obama’s troubled health care law the “biggest problem of his presidency” Thursday as he introduced a segment on Obama’s press conference apologizing for the law’s failings and explaining how he might fix them.

BRIAN WILLIAMS: Good evening. The president today apologized, again, for what has become of his health care initiative. He admitted today he overpromised and was underinformed. He once again took the blame and explained, as he put it, he’s not a perfect man or a perfect president. Of all the things though in his presidency, it’s Barack Obama’s signature piece of legislation that’s giving him the biggest problem of his presidency, and not long after he pledged again to make it right, the insurance industry called him out for changing the rules in the 9th inning of the game.
