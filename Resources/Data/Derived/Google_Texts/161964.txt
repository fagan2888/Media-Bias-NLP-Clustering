Guest columnist Russell Dorsey blames the U.S. Supreme Court for the "anchor baby" problem, but the 14th Amendment to the Constitution states that "all persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States". So if Dorsey does not like the "anchor baby" principle, he should direct his anger at the people who ratified the 14th Amendment.The Supreme Court has nothing to do with it.

Since Dorsey is a factory worker, I would bet that his real problem with freer immigration policy is the increased competition there would be for jobs such as his. But an economic protectionism mindset like that only enhances the protected person's sense of entitlement. So if Dorsey's real objection to freer immigration policy is his objection to job competition, he should be forthright about it instead of attacking the actions of people who are only trying to improve their place in life.
