Then, the last two weeks of April saw an additional $454 million inflow, trimming outflow for the month to a net $239 million.\n\n\u201cThere are 14 biotech ETFs in total, controlling almost $10 billion of assets, and in the first two months \u2014 because it was a risk-off momentum across the board \u2014 $2.1 billion departed,\u201d said Monish Shah, Mizuho Securities USA executive director and head of ETF trading. \u201cIn the last week (of April), which was again a risk-off momentum, biotech ETFs did not see a major outflow technically.\u201d\n\nSo is this a propitious time to start looking at biotech ETFs again?\n\nFlows into biotech ETFs were a positive $23 million in the second week of May, but that gave way to a $39 million outflow in the third week, through Thursday.\n\nShah advises investors to be careful in the near term, even though the sector\u2019s long-term prospect is good. \u201cThe trend seems to be holding up, but I advise near-term caution, because there are many positive as well as some negative factors.\u201d\n\nThe two largest biotech ETFs, iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology (IBB) and SPDR S&P Biotech ETF (XBI) were in the positive flow territory through the end of April, adding a net $221 million and $85 million, respectively. The $6.2 billion IBB is down 1.06% in the past three months, and the $1.7 billion XBI is up 5%. They are still a respective 35% and 42% below their 52-week highs.\n\nIBB has slipped below its 50-day moving average, a bearish sign, while XBI is testing resistance at its own 50-day line.\n\nNext in line are $821 million First Trust NYSE Arca Biotech ETF (FBT) and $511 million VanEck Vectors Biotech ETF (BBH). They\u2019re up roughly a respective 4% and 1% in the past three months. However, FBT experienced strong outflow each of the first four months of 2016, resulting in a net outflow of $1.75 billion. BHH saw some positive flow in April, but ended with a net $57 million outflow over the same period.\n\nAs with the first two funds, FBT and BBH are also both testing resistance at their 50-day lines.\n\nA series of positive factors are, however, in the pipeline for biotechs. \u201cThe P/E ratios have been coming down. That may suggest to some investors that stocks are more reasonably valued,\u201d said Michael Cohick, ETF product manager at Van Eck Global. He also notes that biotechs are poised to benefit from the continuing demographic factors of an aging population. Also, with the Affordable Care Act, more people are now covered by insurance and can afford some of the new therapies.\n\n\u201cThat, along with the incredible continued innovation that\u2019s coming out of the companies in the sector themselves, I think may point to potential entry points,\u201d said Cohick.\n\nThat said, the sector is known for displaying very high volatility. \u201cFrom terrible terrible negative performance in January to slightly negative in February (to a positive performance in March and April for the VanEck Vectors Biotech ETF), \u2026 the short-term performance story has returned,\u201d said Cohick. \u201cBut I would suggest investors should always continue to monitor the biotech company earnings, as well as the M&A activity.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s why he prefers a concentrated portfolio of the 25 largest and most liquid biotech stocks, such as represented in BBH. \u201cIf you want the safety of the larger companies, it may be a better way to play the sector,\u201d he said.\n\nThe fund\u2019s top holdings are Gilead Sciences (GILD), Amgen (AMGN), Celgene (CELG), Biogen (BIIB) and Medivation (MDVN), together representing about 45% of the fund\u2019s assets.", "article_metadata": {"description": "After being one of the worst-performing sectors since last summer, biotechnology firms have shown a few encouraging signs since March.", "og": {"site_name": "Investor's Business Daily", "description": "After being one of the worst-performing sectors since last summer, biotechnology firms have shown a few encouraging signs since March.", "title": "Biotech Stocks Show Signs Of Revival, But Beware Of Side Effects", "url": "http://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/etfs/biotech-stocks-show-signs-of-revival-but-beware-of-side-effects/", "image": {"width": 1000, "identifier": "http://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/BIOTECH_ndvn_051216_adobe.jpg", "height": 565}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/BIOTECH_ndvn_051216_adobe.jpg?w=640", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@IBDInvestors"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-ibd-favicon-v7-270x270.png", "keywords": "etf trends,biotech stocks,science,biotech", "date": "2016-05-20 13:07:14:-08:00", "article": {"published_time": "2016-05-20T20:07:14+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-05-20T20:07:14+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Next in line are $821 million First Trust NYSE Arca Biotech ETF (FBT) and $511 million VanEck Vectors Biotech ETF (BBH).\n\u201cIn the last week (of April), which was again a risk-off momentum, biotech ETFs did not see a major outflow technically.\u201dSo is this a propitious time to start looking at biotech ETFs again?\nFlows into biotech ETFs were a positive $23 million in the second week of May, but that gave way to a $39 million outflow in the third week, through Thursday.\nBHH saw some positive flow in April, but ended with a net $57 million outflow over the same period.\nHowever, FBT experienced strong outflow each of the first four months of 2016, resulting in a net outflow of $1.75 billion."}
