One of the reasons is the flu vaccine prepared for this year is not tackling the actual strain that has hit. In fact, the Center for Disease Control (CDC) says this may lift reported cases.\n\nIn a new research report from the health care/life sciences analysts at Baird, they are tracing hospital pulmonary admissions, as well as some top stocks that could benefit.\n\nThe Baird analysts also point out that the more advanced strands of this year\u2019s virus may result in increased hospitalizations for the top providers. They also note that recent commentary from hospitals confirms this trend. Ultimately, this could result in increased earnings that are not currently baked into the first quarter and the rest of 2015.\n\nHere are five stocks rated Outperform at Baird that are seeing a high percentage of pulmonary Medicare admissions.\n\nCommunity Health Systems Inc. (NYSE: CYH) is a top stock idea at Baird, and on Wall Street, for 2015, with the thesis being predicated on coverage expansion under the Affordable Care Act (ACA) providing a substantial boost in 2015 and beyond, and a large asset base providing geographic diversification and scale advantages. The stock is one that analysts see as most levered to the states where Medicaid expansion could be the greatest, and more exposed to health care reform than any other company in the firm\u2019s coverage universe. While flu-related physician visits decreased in the past week, they are much higher than last year.\n\nThe Baird price target on the stock is $69. The Thomson/First Call consensus price objective is much lower at $62.74. Shares closed Tuesday at $49.29.\n\nALSO READ: J.P.

It has scale advantages as the largest private hospital operator in the United States and is diversified geographically. The company also benefits from local market density, with the number one or number two market share in most of its local markets. Analysts feel that that increasing Medicaid enrollment and the potential for additional states to expand Medicaid eligibility could provide upside to their model and provide built-in growth for 2015. HCA\u2019s flu-related visits also dropped last week but are up year over year.\n\nThe Baird price target is $95, and the consensus target is $85.45. HCA shares closed trading Tuesday at $72.42.\n\nLifepoint Hospital Inc. (NASDAQ: LPNT) is a leading hospital company focused on providing quality health care services close to home. Through its subsidiaries, LifePoint operates more than 60 hospital campuses in 20 states. In many of the cities the company serves, Lifepoint is the sole community hospital provider. It is another of the companies that analysts see as benefiting from the 2015 Medicaid expansion. Flu-related doctor visits declined in the past week but are half a percentage point higher than last year.\n\nThe Baird price target is $77, and the consensus is posted at higher at $80.42. The stock closed Tuesday at $69.11.\n\nALSO READ: 4 UBS Quality Growth at a Reasonable Price Tech Stocks to Buy\n\nTenet Healthcare Corp.

(NYSE: UHS) is one of the nation\u2019s largest hospital companies, operating, through its subsidiaries, behavioral health facilities, acute care hospitals and ambulatory centers throughout the United States, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.
