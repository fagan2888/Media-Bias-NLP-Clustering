DEERFIELD, Ill. - The incidence of flu is beginning to abate across California and Oregon, according to the latest Walgreens Flu Index report. However, flu activity is still relatively high across Wyoming, Montana and Kentucky, according to the report.

The top 10 markets with flu activity for the week of March 27 were:

El Paso, Texas (Las Cruces, N.M.); Harlingen – Weslaco – Brownsville – McAllen, Texas; Louisville, Ky.; Beaumont – Port Arthur, Texas; Columbus – Tupelo – West Point – Houston, Miss.; Paducah, Ky. – Cape Girardeau, Mo. – Harrisburg, Ill.; Houston; Albuquerque-Santa Fe, N.M.; Chattanooga, Tenn.; and Lincoln & Hastings –Kearney, Neb.

The top 10 markets with flu activity gains during that time period were:

Waco-Temple-Bryan, Texas; Albany-Schenectady-Troy, N.Y.; Shreveport, La.; Traverse City-Cadillac, Mich.; Austin, Texas; Joplin, Mo.-Pittsburg, Kan.; Wichita-Hutchinson, Kan.; Springfield, Mo.; Yakima-Pasco-Richland-Kenneiwck, Wash.; and Wilmington, N.C.

The Walgreens Flu Index does not provide data measuring actual levels or severity of flu activity, but rather, illustrates which populations are experiencing the most incidences each week based on Index methodology.

The Walgreens Flu Index is compiled using weekly retail prescription data for antiviral medications used to treat influenza across Walgreens locations nationwide. The data is analyzed at state and geographic market levels to measure absolute impact and incremental change of antiviral medications on a per store average basis, and does not include markets in which Walgreens has fewer than 10 retail locations.
