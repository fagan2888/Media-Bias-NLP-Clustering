With the memory of that finish still fresh, McIlroy put in a brief, almost-gloomy appearance in the interview room afterward.\n\n\u201cLook, I\u2019m going to need something basically around 61, 62 (Sunday) to have a real chance,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not sure that\u2019s going to happen, but we\u2019ll see.\u201d\n\nNo one has ever shot better than 63 in any major championship.\n\nMcIlroy still wound up with a respectable 68 that left him 6 under for the tournament. But he probably had a lower number in mind after playing the front nine in 32.\n\nA booming 340-yard drive set up an eagle at the second and helped extend McIlroy\u2019s productive run on the par-5 holes. After birdieing the three remaining par-5s, he\u2019s 11 under in 12 opportunities, a strategy he laid out before touching down at Augusta.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve played them more conservatively. When I put myself in a good position off the tee, I just try to hit it in the middle of the green and take my two putts,\u201d McIlroy said.\n\n\u201cA couple of times, once yesterday on 13, I hit it close and made eagle \u2026 I just played them a little more conservatively or smartly, and missed it in the right areas when I have and been able to get it down.\u201d\n\nBut that wasn\u2019t the case at either Nos. 16 or 18, where poor tee shots left him scrambling to hold onto those gains. At the 16th, he flew the bunker on the right of the green and couldn\u2019t convert the up-and-down; at the 18th, he drove into a fairway bunker, left his approach short and missed a left-to-right 8-footer to save par.\n\nMcIlroy said the pressure of his pursuit of the career Grand Slam hadn\u2019t distracted him, nor the fact that Jordan Spieth, who\u2019s leading the Masters, has said he\u2019d like to steal McIlroy\u2019s No. 1 ranking and is suddenly getting close.\n\nInstead, the Northern Irishman said most of the wounds he\u2019s suffered trying to win here \u2014 like the triple-bogey he made at No. 10 while leading in 2011 \u2014 were self-inflicted.\n\n\u201cI definitely feel like I play this golf course better and better every year that I come here,\u201d McIlroy said. \u201cI don\u2019t know, I just need to keep putting numbers up like I did today. I know I\u2019m capable of it \u2026 just a few stretches of holes have held me back and that\u2019s really been the case this year again.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Rory McIlroy starts fast, but stumbles home in Masters finish", "title": "Rory McIlroy starts fast, but stumbles home in Masters finish", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/04/11/rory-mcilroy-starts-fast-but-stumbles-home-in-masters-finish/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "height": 630}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-04-11T17:36:09+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-04-11T17:36:09+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd4086\"", "article_summary": "\u201cI definitely feel like I play this golf course better and better every year that I come here,\u201d McIlroy said.\nWith the memory of that finish still fresh, McIlroy put in a brief, almost-gloomy appearance in the interview room afterward.\nAUGUSTA, Ga. \u2014 Rory McIlroy roared off the starting line and almost as suddenly ran out of gas.\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure that\u2019s going to happen, but we\u2019ll see.\u201dNo one has ever shot better than 63 in any major championship.\nMcIlroy still wound up with a respectable 68 that left him 6 under for the tournament."}
