The race of the newest Romney was key focus of the jokes.\n\nDays later, and after a firestorm of criticism, Harris-Perry tweeted an apology for the insensitive remarks. A tearful on-air apology followed.\n\nFine, but the problem is that Harris-Perry didn\u2019t apologize for the worst offense.\n\nMelissa Harris-Perry\u2019s career is rooted in discussing, writing about, and advocating for African-American issues. Someone claiming such expertise should not only have known better, but instinctively realized at the time that such comments are offensive. Instead, she participated in the offense.\n\nJust as a Newtown, Connecticut parent shouldn\u2019t be expected to abide a tasteless joke about Sandy Hook, an authentic advocate for African-American issues should not tolerate \u2014 much less moderate \u2014 a discussion essentially demeaning mixed-race adoption. While not as tragic as Sandy Hook, the discrepancy of adoption rates for black foster children face deserves more coverage than making light of a successful adoption by the family of a prominent Republican.\n\nAccording to U.S. Department of Health and Human Services figures, about one in 100 black children in America\u2019s foster care system awaits adoption \u2014 more than double the rate for white children. Additionally, the average foster care stay for black kids is 29 months, versus 18.3 months for white youth. These discrepancies are wide, but reportedly improving.\n\nWhile Harris-Perry could use her soapbox to laud the Romney family for their decision, she chose otherwise.\n\nHarris-Perry\u2019s lack of judgment is secondary to a disturbing pattern she and so many other liberal commentators exhibit.\n\nLiberal pundits have seemingly exchanged altruistic concerns for hyper-partisanship. In this case, Harris-Perry later apologized for using \u201cpoor judgment\u201d in targeting an adopted black child to attack those with whom she disagrees politically.\n\nBut Harris-Perry also recently compared the term \u201cObamacare\u201d \u2014 a term embraced by some supporters of the president\u2019s health care takeover, and the president himself \u2014 to other \u201ccode words\u201d meant to stoke racist animosity. Idioms based on presidential names \u2014 Hoovervilles and Reaganomics, to name a few \u2014 appear throughout history. Rather than pointing this out, she introduces race into the discussion.", "article_metadata": {"description": "MSNBC\u2019s concern for racial issues only applies when it can support progressive programs or Democratic politicians.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "MSNBC host Melissa Harris-Perry seeks forgiveness.
