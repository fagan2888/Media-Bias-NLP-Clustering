Each time, I am touched deeply by the remarkable and personal stories I hear, like Janet\u2019s.\n\nJanet lives in Oregon, and knows firsthand the challenges caregivers face every day. Six years ago Janet left her job as a television film producer for a true labor of love\u2014to care for her step-father with dementia. Before that she aided her daughter as she fought\u2014and won\u2014a battle against brain cancer. And today, Janet helps her 92-year-old mother who now lives with her family.\n\nJanet\u2019s story is an illustration of incredible strength. Like Janet, millions of family caregivers do remarkable things everyday as they help their loved ones to live independently at home\u2014where they want to be. In addition to handling finances, cooking meals, and providing transportation, many caregivers perform complex medical tasks like wound care, managing medications, giving injections, and other tasks once only in the domain of doctors and nurses.\n\nLast week, Janet testified in favor of the Caregiver, Advise, Record, Enable (CARE) Act, a bill being considered by the Oregon Legislature that would require hospitals to:\n\nRecord the name of family caregivers on the medical record of a loved one\n\nInform the family caregiver when their loved one is to be discharged or moved\n\nGive the family caregiver explanation and live instruction of the medical tasks they will need to perform at home\n\n\n\n\n\nCaregivers fight for the CARE Act\n\nJanet is not alone in her fight for the CARE Act. Family caregivers across the country, like Kristin in Oklahoma, Tish in Indiana, and Cynthia in Pennsylvania, have been speaking out and sharing their personal stories, urging their state legislators to pass the CARE Act\u2014one commonsense solution to help make their big responsibilities a little bit easier. In doing so, they\u2019ve been shining a spotlight on all that family caregivers do.\n\nThanks in large part to Kristin\u2019s courage in bringing her family\u2019s experience to the public\u2019s attention, Oklahoma became the first the state in the nation to make the CARE Act law last year; New Jersey followed shortly. In 2015 as caregivers across the country continue to call for support, the CARE Act has become law in five additional states:Mississippi, New Mexico, Arkansas, West Virginia, Virginia, Nevada, Indiana, and Colorado.\n\nWith the help of caregivers like Janet, Kristin, Tish and Cynthia, we continue to fight for the CARE Act\u2014and other commonsense solutions to help them and their loved ones\u2014in states across the country:\n\nIf you\u2019re a family caregiver, I urge you to join me and all the other caregivers who have shared their stories\u2014because together we can fight for you and your family.\n\nShare your story.\n\n*Blog Updated 5/11/2015\n\nElaine Ryan is the vice president of State Advocacy and Strategy Integration (SASI) for AARP.
