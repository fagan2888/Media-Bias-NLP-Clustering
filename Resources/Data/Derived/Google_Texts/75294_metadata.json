The practice guards against false identification.\n\nAccording to the Innocence Project, \u201cwitness misidentification is the single greatest cause of wrongful conviction nationwide.\u201d False identification played a role in 73 percent of the 311 cases where DNA evidence ultimately led to an exoneration.\n\nCriminologists and psychologists have long advocated sequential double-blind lineups\u2014where neither the witnesses nor the investigators showing them the photos know if a suspect is included\u2014because police can unintentionally influence witnesses. \u201cDetectives are emotionally involved in the case as well as the victims,\u201d Baltimore Deputy Commissioner John Skinner tells CBS Baltimore.\n\nMoreover, instead of presenting multiple photos at once, police will present mug shots sequentially. Presenting images simultaneously can also lead to misidentification.\n\nIn addition to devastating the lives of the wrongly convicted, false identification can mean real criminals go free. So kudos to Baltimore police and prosecutors for admitting past mistakes and taking steps to ensure they won\u2019t happen again.\n\nBaltimore joins just a handful of cities across the country that conduct sequential double-blind lineups. Even though there is overwhelming evidence that the practice reduces error, police associations and district attorneys often oppose attempts to adopt double-blind lineups. In California, for instance, former Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger vetoed lineup reforms after law enforcement agencies objected.\n\nAccording to the Innocence Project, Dallas, Minneapolis, Boston, Philadelphia, San Diego, San Francisco, Tucson, and Denver conduct double-blind lineups\u2014as do police in New Jersey, North Carolina, and Connecticut.\n\nBaltimore police have also begun to record interrogations, starting with cases involving serious crimes.
