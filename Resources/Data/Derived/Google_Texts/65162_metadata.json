He sees those qualities clearly in Tejay van Garderen, who seemingly put a stranglehold on the USA Pro Challenge on Saturday with a spectacular time-trial performance on Vail Pass.\n\n\u201cWhen you look at the ingredients of what makes a good endurance athlete, one, you\u2019ve got to have the genetics,\u201d said Heiden , a hero of the 1980 Lake Placid Olympics, a team physician for van Garderen\u2019s BMC Racing and a member of the U.S. Bicycling Hall of Fame. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to have that physiologic ability. Also you have to have a good mental toughness. Sometimes that combination is hard to get.\n\n\u201cTejay is one of those guys that\u2019s got the physiology, and he\u2019s also got that mental toughness.\u201d\n\nVan Garderen showcased both Saturday in a rainy climb up Vail Pass. Beginning the day with a somewhat tenuous 20-second lead in the overall standings, the Aspen resident obliterated the course record he set last year by 37 seconds and will take a lead of 1:32 into Sunday\u2019s final stage from Boulder to Denver via Golden and Lookout Mountain. He is now the prohibitive favorite to repeat as Pro Challenge champion.\n\nPHOTOS: USA Pro Challenge 2014, Stage 6\n\n\u201cI love coming here and racing in Colorado,\u201d van Garderen said. \u201cThis race really is one of the highest-class races in the world. To win it for the second time, that\u2019s no easy feat. I\u2019m really honored.\u201d\n\nFormer Boulder resident Tom Danielson, second in the overall standings, was struck by van Garderen\u2019s toughness Friday when the peloton rode through South Park and over Hoosier Pass to Breckenridge in persistent cold rain.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t see anyone in the world beating him here,\u201d said Danielson, second in Saturday\u2019s stage. \u201cJust looking at his face (Friday), we were shivering and hypothermic and I looked over at him and he was having a good time \u2014 or at least looked like it.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a really credible result when you stand next to the guy that finished fifth in the Tour de France and one of the best riders in the world.\u201d\n\nDespite multiple crashes at the Tour de France, van Garderen was in contention for a podium finish until he had a horrible day in the Pyrenees on Stage 16. Finishing in the top three was out of the question, but he fought back to finish fifth for the second time in three years.\n\n\u201cHe had so many problems, so many reasons to give up and quit, so many excuses to bail out of that dream of finishing on the podium,\u201d Danielson said. \u201cAnd he should have finished on the podium. To fight for the top five and get that, that was pretty impressive.\u201d\n\nVan Garderen may be on the verge of becoming a superstar, but teammate Michael Schaer said he is \u201cuncomplicated\u201d and easy going.\n\n\u201cWhen we go to the dinner table, he is one of us,\u201d Schaer said. \u201cHe\u2019s not a superstar; he\u2019s really a kind person. We have a good time all the time. We can joke with him.\u201d\n\nVan Garderen is only 26, in a sport in which athletes peak in their late 20s and early 30s. People around the sport talk about how he is maturing.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s always been a talented kid,\u201d said retired racer Christian Vande Velde. \u201cNow with maturity and experience, you can use all that talent the way it should be.\u201d\n\nVande Velde senses it from the outside. Heiden sees it at work within the team.\n\n\u201cThe thing I\u2019ve really been impressed with is his leadership abilities these last couple of years,\u201d Heiden said. \u201cI look at him voicing his opinion as a leader and having the respect of the rest of the riders on the team and the rest of the riders in the peloton.\u201d\n\nVan Garderen also is benefiting from an accumulation of experience that figures to make him a contender in the Tour de France for years to come, along with his development as an endurance athlete.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019ve done the Tour de France multiple times, very often you realize you\u2019re going over the same climbs so you know what to expect,\u201d Heiden said. \u201cThe other thing is age. Usually you come into your physiologic prime for endurance sports in your late 20s, early 30s. He\u2019s now coming into that.\u201d\n\nJohn Meyer: 303-954-1616, jmeyer@denverpost.com or twitter.com/johnmeyer\n\nUSA Pro Challenge in review\n\nStage 1, Aspen-Snowmass circuit, 61 miles: Two Boulder riders who are friends and training partners finished inches apart to lead the way.
