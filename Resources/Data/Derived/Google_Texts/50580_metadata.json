No, not the long agonizing period of suffering known as \"spring\" in New Hampshire. It's the annual announcement of the \"losses\" incurred by the local \"not-for-profit\" health care monopoly, LRGHealthcare.\n\nWith the front page of the Friday Daily Sun sporting a picture of Jules Verne's \"20,000 Leagues Under the Sea\" Nautilus snout (Wait, never mind \u2014 that's the main entrance to LRGH that has done so much to make us locals healthier), we read of the financial hole and its causes, as outlined by the ever-so-optimistic financial chief, Henry Lipman, who in closing his laundry list of causes, blame, and denial of any causation on his part as the \"senior vice president of financial strategy and external relations,\" (aka, minister of propaganda and popular enlightenment) announced, \"I don't lose sleep.\" And why should he? Despite rounds of layoffs, years of fiscal crisis, wasted monies and non-mission critical dollar-wasting boondoggles, all taking place under his watchful eye, there he is. As if made of Teflon, not one speck of the hot steaming financial mess has ever stuck to him.\n\nOn cue as always, in presenting his report and himself for questioning, he came prepared with the usual list of bogeymen responsible, and defenses against the most obvious causes, hardly even making an effort to hide his blatant biases and partisanship in the process.\n\nObamacare? No way! \"Lipman dismissed suggestions that the Affordable Care Act is responsible for the financial troubles besetting LRGHealthcare.\" In fact, he claims with a straight face, without its affects on New Hampshire, \"we'd actually be worse off.\" No word yet on whether he's had any takers on that bridge in Brooklyn he's been trying to sell.\n\nNay, it's not Obamacare that has caused the latest financial stress, it's ... wait for it ... the evil insurance companies. Well, the private ones anyway, what with their plans trying to \"offset high premiums with high deductibles and co-pays.\" Not that this is caused by Obamacare; it's just coincidence that the cost of buying insurance went through the roof with its passage.\n\nAlso at fault is the fact that people are growing old. This adds costs as well. Too bad we can't just call in a few \"sandmen\" from Logan's Run to fix this one.\n\nRounding out the fiscal enemies of the local non-profit health-care monopoly are all those pesky small businesses \u2014 you know, the ones where those of us in the area who do work gain employment. \"Lipman noted that in the Lakes Region, with its large number of small businesses, employers tend to provide relatively less generous health insurance plans.\"\n\nAs one of those small business owners, I must say, I was flabbergasted and more than a little angry when I read that one. Our company has struggled for 26 years to provide our employees with the best health care possible. For a while, we had a good thing going. Along came then-state Sen. Shaheen and her New Hampshire Senate Bill 711 that drove most insurers out of the state, thus eliminating choices. No doubt the well-rested Mr. Lipman supported that. Then came bipartisan \"reform\" eliminating insurance premium reductions for healthy people. Gotta make everyone equal \u2014 equally pay, that is.\n\nIn the liberal/socialist/communist world of Mr. Lipman, he no doubt welcomed this too as he dozed off into his peaceful nightly slumbers. Then came the war between LRGH and the insurance companies who dared to question some of the exorbitant costs driving LRGH's definition of \"health care\" (among these the golf cart transport of employees to and from their cars, a cable TV show, etc. etc.). This \"charitable\" and \"caring\" non-profit demonstrated how far they were willing to go in defending their practices by denying services to those of us who had these companies as our carriers.\n\n\"It was a tough year,\" notes Lipman. But not to worry because, as quoted in the Sun article, he predicts, \"there are lots of opportunities.\" Uh-oh! Maybe he'll be sleeping well at night, but I can't help but think that, as a taxpayer, business owner, and otherwise healthy and productive citizen here in the Lakes Region, I am facing even more restless nights than I do now.\n\nI don't believe I would be wrong to predict Mr. Lipman's \"opportunity\" translates into yet another medical extraction ... from my wallet.\n\nDoug Lambert\n\nGilford", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.laconiadailysun.com/opinion/letters/94392-doug-lambert-5-4-730", "site_name": "laconia", "type": "article", "title": "I was flabbergasted to read blast at Lakes Region's small businesses"}, "google-site-verification": "dXTs0LVX6za33v4tDFZ21vh3gqaQfGRKHD4F5G9V7mc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2.0"}, "article_summary": "\"Lipman noted that in the Lakes Region, with its large number of small businesses, employers tend to provide relatively less generous health insurance plans.\"\nIt's the annual announcement of the \"losses\" incurred by the local \"not-for-profit\" health care monopoly, LRGHealthcare.\nIn the liberal/socialist/communist world of Mr. Lipman, he no doubt welcomed this too as he dozed off into his peaceful nightly slumbers.\nOur company has struggled for 26 years to provide our employees with the best health care possible.\nNay, it's not Obamacare that has caused the latest financial stress, it's ... wait for it ... the evil insurance companies."}
