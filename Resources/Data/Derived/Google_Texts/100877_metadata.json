That means he didn\u2019t push for a tax increase. But what about Barack Obama? He put a trillion dollar stimulus program, multiple bailouts, Medicaid expansion, Obamacare and God knows what else on the credit card. And, oh\u2013by the way\u2013he also put two wars on the credit card. He wound down the Iraq war on the timetable that had already been set by the Bush administration, and has continued the Afghanistan war for five years and counting. Eighty percent of American casualties in Afghanistan have come on Obama\u2019s watch, and I assume most of our credit-card spending has, as well. Obama\u2019s deficits are unprecedented in American history, and they continue at a level never before seen. So it is hard to understand how Democrats think they can get away with impugning Bush for \u201cputting two wars on the credit card.\u201d\n\nMichael Ramirez comments on the budget that Obama put forward last week\u2013not to be adopted, actually, but as some sort of campaign document directed at low-information voters who can\u2019t count.

When your children are paying the interest on that amount\u2013it won\u2019t be 3%, either\u2013you will wonder what in the world we were doing, electing an unqualified, left-wing bozo like Barack Obama as president.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Power Line", "description": "Democrats love to say that George Bush put two wars, Iraq and Afghanistan, on the nation\u2019s credit card.
