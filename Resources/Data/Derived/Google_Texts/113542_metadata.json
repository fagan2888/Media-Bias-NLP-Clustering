Fans pawed with numb fingers to pull out phones and car keys before passing through metal detectors.\n\nThe Broncos allowed in blankets, but advised that people drape them over their shoulders to keep the security lines moving.\n\n\u201cI wish it wasn\u2019t this way; I mean it\u2019s bitterly awful standing out here,\u201d said Ellen Buckner of Greenwood Village, who rarely misses a game, rain, shine or risk of frostbite. \u201cBut people have to understand this is the world we live in, a world with Paris (terrorist attacks) and Colorado (Planned Parenthood clinic shooting). You just don\u2019t know who\u2019s coming in behind you and what they have in mind.\u201d\n\nBy 10 p.m. Sunday, when fans will be returning to their vehicles to go home, weather forecasters expect a 20-degree chill, 92 percent humidity, light snow and a 4 mph breeze.\n\nIt might not be Green Bay, but it sure won\u2019t be Tampa Bay.\n\nJoey Bunch: 303-954-1174, jbunch@denverpost.com or @joeybunch", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Denver fans braving frozen tundra to see Broncos take on Patriots", "title": "Denver fans braving frozen tundra to see Broncos take on Patriots", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/11/29/denver-fans-braving-frozen-tundra-to-see-broncos-take-on-patriots/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151129__cold-wx-broncos-fansp1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151129__cold-wx-broncos-fansp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-11-29T17:52:31+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-20T06:49:37+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1807\"", "article_summary": "The Broncos allowed in blankets, but advised that people drape them over their shoulders to keep the security lines moving.\n\u201cThis would kill a Tampa Bay fan,\u201d said Alberto Rogers, a New England Patriots fan who flew in for the game.\nBut thirsty is about all that felt normal Sunday night, as people tailgated huddled near propane heaters and speaking through scarves.\nFans pawed with numb fingers to pull out phones and car keys before passing through metal detectors.\nSurprisingly, there were takers, passing her $2 for a bottle that she plucked from and an ice-filled cooler."}
