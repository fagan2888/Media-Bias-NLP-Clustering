Her candidacy has long been a favorite of conservative pundits who convinced themselves that Wehby, a pediatric neurosurgeon running in a state that had an especially rough experience with the Affordable Care Act rollout, was ideally positioned to campaign hard on health policy and take down Democratic incumbent Jeff Merkley.\n\nThe Wehby campaign\u2019s attempts to brush off the Buzzfeed story were inept and made the situation worse. At first they denied everything. \u201cThe suggestion that a pediatric neurosurgeon needs to copy a health care plan from American Crossroads is absurd,\u201d a spokesman told Kaczynski, throwing in this gloriously passive-aggressive kicker: \u201cDr. Wehby is too busy performing brain surgery on sick children to respond, sorry.\u201d\n\nThen came the inevitable reckoning: the campaign pulled the plan from the website and copped to the plagiarism, blaming it all on Wehby\u2019s former campaign manager, Charlie Pearce, who denies everything. Now Kaczynski is reporting that Wehby also plagiarized portions of her economic plan from Sen. Rob Portman. You could say all this would hurt Wehby\u2019s chances at victory, but things didn\u2019t look good for her to begin with. Nearly every public poll of the Oregon Senate race has given Merkley a double-digit lead. A Koch-funded outside spending group recently abandoned its plans to air anti-Merkley attack ads in October. Whatever chance at victory she might have has all but vanished.\n\nWhat makes this whole strange scenario even funnier is that while Wehby promoted herself as a staunch Obamacare opponent, conservatives actually hated Wehby\u2019s health plan and had deep suspicions about her on health care in general. During the Republican primary, she was attacked by her Tea Party challenger for having said nice things about a health plan proposed by Oregon\u2019s other Democratic senator, Ron Wyden. And for all her talk of \u201crepealing\u201d Obamacare, she also wanted to keep the parts of it that polled well and would often talk about \u201cfixing\u201d the law, as opposed to doing away with it altogether.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Monica Wehby cribbed her health plan from a Karl Rove survey.
