Levy, former chief executive of Boston's Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and author of the blog Not Running a Hospital, said in an email. \"UMass has not been run in that manner, though. So, now it finds itself in a catch-up situation and is trying to stabilize the organization.\"The operator of a sprawling system, UMass Memorial runs community hospital campuses in Clinton, Marlboro, Palmer, Fitchburg and Leominster. Yet all of those entities are dwarfed by UMass Memorial Medical Center in Worcester, a 700-bed academic medical center on multiple campuses.Between 2012 and 2013, payments the medical center received for all patient care dropped 1.5 percent. Meanwhile, costs for salaries, benefits, contract labor, supplies and other expenses jumped 8 percent and remain a challenge.Wages and related costs jumped about $20 million a year in 2013, and the medical center spent about $4.4 million to prepare for a possible nurses' strike, the system told bond investors in February. The settlement with nurses included an agreement to hire additional nurses at a cost of about $15 million a year, UMass Memorial said.Revenue slumped partly because the medical center, like many hospitals, has been admitting fewer people for inpatient treatment and designating more patients for \"observation\" care. Observation is for patients too sick to go home but not sick enough to admit. Hospitals make less money on observation patients.The medical center recorded 38,403 hospital discharges in 2013, down 7 percent from 2012, according to its most recent quarterly earnings report. During the same period, observations jumped 17 percent to 10,028.UMass Memorial Health Care executives told bond investors in a February letter that the entire system's revenue dropped by about $29 million because of patient volume moving to observation care.Falling revenue is a problem for hospitals, said Boston University School of Public Health Professor Alan Sager, because so many of their costs are fixed and cannot be reduced as quickly as revenue can drop.\"If volume drops, revenue drops much faster than costs,\" he said. \"Hospital profitability, to a considerable degree, is volume driven.\"Timothy F. Gens, executive vice president and general counsel for the Massachusetts Hospital Association, said every hospital in Massachusetts is going through similar financial stress.The federal Affordable Care Act \u2014 known as Obamacare \u2014 will cost Massachusetts hospitals $5 billion in the next 10 years, in the form of decreased reimbursements, he said.Government has been trying to move the health care industry from a pay-for-services model \u2014 which paid for each medical procedure \u2014 to a global payment model, in which health care organizations receive payments for keeping patients healthy.\"Because some of these changes are experimental, and some are revolutionary, you have to continually adjust,\" he said. \"Every hospital is struggling, but not necessarily in the same way. The challenges UMass faces do not make them unique.\"UMass Memorial Chief Executive Dr. Eric W. Dickson touched on the importance of patient volume recently when he wrote in his blog, \"Everyday Innovators,\" about offering same-day or next-day appointments to patients.\"Long wait times lead to unhappy patients who may look to find providers elsewhere, and we cannot afford to be turning patients away,\" Dr. Dickson wrote.Observation care is not the only factor impacting UMass Memorial hospitals.Payments from federal programs such as Medicare, which represented 39 percent of the Worcester medical center's business in 2012, are growing slower than in the past because of federal efforts to reduce the nation's budget deficit.The medical center also gets a larger-than-average chunk of its business from Medicaid, a state-federal health plan for the poor that is a less lucrative source of money for hospitals. Medicaid represented 24 percent of the medical center's business in 2012, while hospitals statewide got an average 19 percent of their business from Medicaid.In addition, UMass Memorial Medical Center has been in a competitive battle for patients with cross-town rival St. Vincent Hospital, a Tenet Healthcare Corp. 300-bed hospital that a number of insurance plans present to patients as a lower-cost place for care.Between 2008 and 2012, inpatient discharges jumped 8 percent at St. Vincent but inched up only 0.9 percent at UMass Memorial Medical Center, according to data from the state Center for Health Information and Analysis.Commercial insurers, prodded by employers who buy insurance for their workers, are placing pressure on hospitals, too. Although some hospital systems have grown so powerful they can demand larger payments from insurers, hospitals such as UMass Memorial Medical Center cannot do that, said Joshua Archambault, a senior fellow at the Pioneer Institute, a public policy think tank in Boston.\"I think places like UMass are feeling it both from public payers but also on the commercial side, where if they're not in that top top tier, then they're really feeling pressure from some of these insurance contracts,\" Mr. Archambault said. \"They're going to make less over the long run.\"Contact Lisa Eckelbecker at leckelbecker@telegram.com.
