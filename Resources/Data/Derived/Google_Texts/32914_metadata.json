She later issued a statement of apology.\n\n\u201cI apologize to everyone for the insensitive comments posted on my Facebook account,\u201d she said Saturday. \u201cMy comments did not reflect my personal views about any individual or minority group, only my frustration that our government system sometimes seems out of balance. We live in a great country, but the agenda for our elected officials is too often dictated by special interest groups. My comments did not reflect my true feelings, and I am sorry for anyone may have been offended.\u201d\n\nRobert Patison, general counsel for Lucas Oil Products, also issued a statement on Saturday: \u201cWe provide significant financial support for a broad range of organizations that serve the needs of veterans, women, other minority groups, and disadvantaged individuals throughout the United States.
