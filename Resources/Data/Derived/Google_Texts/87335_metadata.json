He was sacked twice and endured at least half a dozen knockdowns, including three on one series.\n\nFor the second week in a row, the Patriots (12-4) missed a chance to earn the top playoff seed by winning. Their last shot at the No. 1 seed hinged on Denver losing its regular-season finale to San Diego.\n\nThe Patriots, who came into the game assured of a first-round bye, rested several injured starters. Brady\u2019s afternoon ended when he was buried on a third-down sack with five minutes left, and he watched the Patriots\u2019 final offensive series from the sideline along with teammate Rob Gronkowski.\n\nBrady finished 12 for 21 for a season-low 134 yards, and was held without a touchdown pass for the first time this season.\n\nHe spent most of the first half handing off, with the Patriots running the ball on 16 of their first 18 plays. Brady threw only five passes in the first half, the lowest halftime total in any game he has started, according to STATS.\n\nBrady tweaked his right ankle in the second quarter when Ndamukong Suh rolled into his legs on a third-down incompletion, but the quarterback was back for the next series.\n\nIn the second half he came out throwing, and running back James White turned a short pass into a 68-yard gain to set up New England\u2019s touchdown. It was scored on a 2-yard run by Steven Jackson \u2014 his first TD since joining New England on Dec 22.\n\nDeVante Parker won a jump-ball battle for a long pass to make a 46-yard catch, setting up the touchdown that put Miami ahead to stay with seven minutes left. The rookie first-round pick had five catches for 106 yards, both season highs.\n\nMiami scored the game\u2019s first touchdown on Ryan Tannehill\u2019s 15-yard pass to Parker with 36 seconds left in the first half. Tannehill finished 25 for 38 for 350 yards and two scores.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Patriots miss chance to clinch No. 1 seed, losing to Miami 20-10", "title": "Patriots miss chance to clinch No. 1 seed, losing to Miami 20-10", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/01/03/patriots-miss-chance-to-clinch-no-1-seed-losing-to-miami-20-10/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160103_020749_lamar-miller.jpg", "height": 431}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160103_020749_lamar-miller.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2016-01-03T14:22:28+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-18T23:18:25+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "For the second week in a row, the Patriots (12-4) missed a chance to earn the top playoff seed by winning.\nBrady finished 12 for 21 for a season-low 134 yards, and was held without a touchdown pass for the first time this season.\nMiami scored the game\u2019s first touchdown on Ryan Tannehill\u2019s 15-yard pass to Parker with 36 seconds left in the first half.\nBrady rose \u2014 slowly \u2014 but the hits kept coming from the Miami Dolphins, who beat New England 20-10 Sunday and prevented the Patriots from clinching the No.\nHe spent most of the first half handing off, with the Patriots running the ball on 16 of their first 18 plays."}
