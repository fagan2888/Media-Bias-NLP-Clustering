John Kasich is being talked up as a 2016 Republican presidential candidate, but 15 percent of Republican voters in Ohio\u2019s 2014 primary declined to vote for him.\n\nKasich, Attorney General Mike DeWine and Treasurer Josh Mandel were the only Republicans on the statewide ticket running unopposed in both the 2010 and 2014 primaries. Of the three candidates, only the governor received a lower percentage of Republican primary votes as an incumbent.\n\nThe secretary of state provided a report to Ohio Watchdog showing 658,155 Republican ballots cast in the May 6 primary, in which Kasich got 559,671 votes. Kasich won the support of 85 percent of 2014 primary voters, down slightly from 86 percent in 2010.\n\nAppearing down-ballot from Kasich in both elections, DeWine\u2019s primary vote total increased from 79 percent in 2010 to 83 percent in 2014; Mandel\u2019s increased from 74 percent to 77 percent.\n\nAlthough Kasich was an incumbent unopposed for the Republican mantle this spring, millions had already been spent on his behalf by May 6. A $475,200 ad buy April 14 was among the $863,093 in expenditures his campaign made during the pre-primary reporting period, followed by $740,950 in ad spending from April 21-28.\n\nDuring the pre-primary reporting period the campaign also received in-kind support worth $631,814 from the Ohio Republican Party \u2014 despite beginning with almost $8 million on hand.\n\nDeWine\u2019s campaign spent just $10,922 during the pre-primary reporting period, and Mandel\u2019s spent $194,662; the two received a combined total of barely $125,000 from ORP. ORP did not respond to a request for comment on the disparity between trends in primary support for Kasich, DeWine and Mandel.\n\nReporters in the Washington, D.C., beltway portray Kasich as a formidable presidential candidate in part because he is heavily favored in the general election against Ed FitzGerald, whose campaign is in such disarray that 25 percent of Democrat respondents to a Sept. 24-29 Quinnipiac poll said they plan to vote for Kasich.\n\nKasich was elected in the 2010 Tea Party wave by embracing the message of smaller government. \u201cI think I was in the Tea Party before there was a Tea Party,\u201d Kasich, a former congressman, famously told a crowd of activists at a 2010 rally before knocking off incumbent Democrat Ted Strickland that November.\n\nKasich\u2019s spokesmen and ORP Chairman Matt Borges contend Kasich has adhered to limited-government ideals as governor, with Borges recently telling Politico Magazine contributor Connie Schultz, \u201cJohn Kasich is the Tea Party.\u201d\n\nMany of Ohio\u2019s traditional Republican base voters would beg to differ.\n\n\u201cI have heard from hundreds of activists, people who supported Governor Kasich in 2010, who aren\u2019t going to vote for him this year,\u201d Ann Becker, president of the Cincinnati Tea Party, told Ohio Watchdog via email. \u201cThey are just going to leave the Governor vote blank.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think politics in Ohio has made a turn. People are no longer going to vote for someone because they have an \u2018R\u2019 after their name,\u201d Becker explained. \u201cWe expect them to uphold the principles that the \u2018R\u2019 is supposed to represent.\u201d\n\n\u201cBringing Obamacare to Ohio by expanding Medicaid, blocking efforts to bring Right to Work to Ohio and not taking a stand against Common Core goes against our principles. We expect better from someone we hired to do a job,\u201d she added. \u201cYou have to earn our vote.\u201d\n\nKasich has reportedly promised union leaders he would not support Right to Work, which lets all workers choose whether to pay a union. Legislators have responded to a grassroots uproar against the national Common Core State Standards with multiple bills to end Ohio\u2019s participation in the program, but Kasich has refused to even acknowledge their efforts.\n\nKasich ran against Obamacare in 2010 only to spend most of 2013 fighting for Obamacare\u2019s Medicaid expansion, enacting the expansion unilaterally. His support for the Obamacare expansion almost prompted a primary challenge from Ted Stevenot, a former Ohio Liberty Coalition president.\n\nBecker and Stevenot are both leaders of Ohio Rising, a nonprofit originally created for the 2011 campaign that passed a constitutional amendment preventing Ohio from creating a state-run Obamacare insurance exchange.\n\nKasich has made it clear renewing the Obamacare expansion is a priority for his likely second term.", "article_metadata": {"description": "GOP Gov.
