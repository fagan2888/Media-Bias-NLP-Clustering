Go ahead. Take his picture. He\u2019s a senior, unselfish and a winner.\n\n\u201cHe loves to compete, just thrives on it,\u201d said Knights coach Tom McCartney.\n\nAnd he\u2019s something most teenagers aren\u2019t \u2014 he\u2019s patient. The quarterback was on a stop-and-go merry-go-round for two seasons and never blinked.\n\n\u201cI mean, it has been pretty crazy,\u201d Feauto said.\n\nHeading into his sophomore season, he was playing in a summer baseball game when word got to him that starting quarterback Anders Hill broke an ankle.\n\n\u201cI thought they were messing with me,\u201d Feauto said. \u201cI wasn\u2019t even sure that I was the backup, then I was the starter.\u201d\n\nAs a sophomore, Feauto averaged 375 yards passing through six games before Hill returned.\n\n\u201cAnd when Anders came back, I was sad they threw him in there, but I understood he was the guy,\u201d Feauto said.\n\nFairview finished 5-5.\n\nLast year it all clicked for Fairview, and for Feauto. A healthy Hill, an emerging Carlo Kemp playing defensive line and a talented senior cast helped Fairview enter the big-school finale at Sports Authority Field with a 12-0 record. Ultimately, the Knights were pasted by superpower Valor Christian 56-16, but Feauto started at cornerback and had a team-high six interceptions. Two came in the playoffs.\n\n\u201cI was happy to jump in (at cornerback) after I had a good scrimmage,\u201d he said. \u201cThe coaches helped me do well at that position. It was just a magical year.\u201d\n\nThis season is also showing promise. The Knights are 2-0. Feauto and Thomas Creese combined for 510 yards passing in the opener, 414 from Feauto. He had turnover issues in Week 2 against Boulder, but he has McCartney\u2019s confidence.\n\nA pitcher and infielder for the Knights in baseball, as well as the point guard for the basketball team, his coach said \u201cthe bigger the game, the better he is \u2014 and that\u2019s why they call him Johnny Football around here.\u201d\n\nAs a senior, Feauto is happy to get another shot at playing quarterback.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s what I\u2019ve been doing my whole life. I\u2019ve played quarterback since I was 8,\u201d Feauto said. \u201cWe\u2019re off to a pretty good start and I want to see where it goes.\u201d\n\nNeil H.
