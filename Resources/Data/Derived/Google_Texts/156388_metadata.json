Patrick Murphy, D-Jupiter, and Republican challenger Carl Domino produced clashes over Obamacare, immigration, U.S. ground troops in Iraq \u2014 and whether their congressional race is limited to the two names on the ballot or is a referendum on President Barack Obama.\n\nMurphy and Domino debated for half an hour with WPTV anchor Michael Williams on Friday night. The debate will air on WPTV Channel 5 at 10 a.m. Sunday.\n\nClick here for a full story on the debate and the race for the Palm Beach-Treasure Coast congressional District 18 seat.\n\nRepresenting a Republican-leaning district at a time when Obama\u2019s popularity is plunging, Murphy has highlighted his willingness to vote with Republicans on some issues, including delays to some provisions of the Affordable Care Act, investigating the Benghazi attacks and finding email-losing IRS official Lois Lerner in contempt of Congress.\n\nBut Murphy voted against outright repeal of Obamacare, favors an immigration pathway to citizenship that Domino calls \u201camnesty\u201d and voted with the rest of the Democratic caucus for Nancy Pelosi as speaker when the 113th Congress convened.\n\nGiven the national climate, Domino hopes that\u2019s enough to sink Murphy in this year\u2019s midterm.\n\n\u201cBarack Obama said it best: \u2018You\u2019re not voting for my name on the ballot. You\u2019re voting for my policies.\u2019 Patrick Murphy has been a strict adherent to those policies,\u201d Domino asserted at the close of the debate.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s our names on the ballot,\u201d Murphy interjected as time ran out.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "Post On Politics", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"url": "http://postonpolitics.blog.palmbeachpost.com/2014/10/25/domino-calls-midterm-an-obama-referendum-murphy-says-its-our-names-on-the-ballot/", "image": "https://cmgpbppostonpolitics.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/wptv-domino-murphy.jpg?w=640", "type": "article", "description": "WEST PALM BEACH -- The only televised debate between Rep.
