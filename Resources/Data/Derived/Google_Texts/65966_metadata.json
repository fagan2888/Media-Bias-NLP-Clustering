The living center is Abilene's fourth-largest employer with 1,240 employees, according to the Abilene Industrial Foundation's website.\n\nKing said Buckingham had been \"disingenuous\" in comments supporting the living center because of her Sunset Commission role, Buckingham countering by saying the commission never specifically targeted Abilene's facility.\n\n\"Again, Susan King has issues with the truth,\" Buckingham said.\n\nBuckingham said her opponent has and \"continues to lie and mislead voters.\"\n\nKing retaliated that Buckingham has engaged throughout the campaign in \"a mudslinging campaign with false attacks.\"\n\nKing's strategy has been building grass roots support in the sprawling district's 17 counties, an approach that she said was perhaps a \"little old-fashioned,\" but one she argues has served her well.\n\nBut challenges remain, she said. Buckingham is \"heavily outspending us,\" King said, meaning the campaign has to \"depend on our friends, neighbors, and supporters turning out to vote.\"", "article_metadata": {"title": "King, Buckingham spiraling toward end of contentious campaign", "og": {"url": "http://www.reporternews.com/news/politics/elections/king-buckingham-spiraling-toward-end-of-contentious-campaign-32bbd455-0bc7-3fc6-e053-0100007f80da-379538961.html", "image": {"width": 1048, "identifier": "http://media.jrn.com/images/2450.jpg", "height": 644}, "type": "article", "description": "Susan King and opponent Dawn Buckingham are  edging toward the end of a long, contentious campaign.", "title": "King, Buckingham spiraling toward end of contentious campaign"}, "twitter": {"site": "@reporternews", "image": "http://media.jrn.com/images/2450.jpg", "description": "Susan King and opponent Dawn Buckingham are  edging toward the end of a long, contentious campaign.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "King, Buckingham spiraling toward end of contentious campaign"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://media.jrn.com/designimages/logo-arn-icon-144.png", "__sync_contentCategory": "premium", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "King retaliated that Buckingham has engaged throughout the campaign in \"a mudslinging campaign with false attacks.\"\nDawn Buckingham (left) and Susan King.\nBuckingham is \"heavily outspending us,\" King said, meaning the campaign has to \"depend on our friends, neighbors, and supporters turning out to vote.\"\nBy Brian Bethel of the Abilene Reporter NewsDistrict 24 candidate Susan King admits it's been a long road to the May 24th runoff election.\n\"Again, Susan King has issues with the truth,\" Buckingham said."}
