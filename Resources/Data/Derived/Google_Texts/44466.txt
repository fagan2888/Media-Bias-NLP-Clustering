Users unhappy with Apple’s gift can’t return it, but they now can make it disappear.

In what CEO Tim Cook described as “the biggest release in the history of music,” Apple last week said it would give away as many as 500 million copies of “Songs of Innocence,” the 13th album from Irish rock band U2.

The album automatically appeared in users’ iTunes library, and on their “purchased” page in the iTunes store. Users had to click on it to download the album. But even if they didn’t download it, the album remained in the library and on the “purchased” page without a way to delete it.

That incited protests from users who are not U2 fans, or Apple’s ability to control what appears in iTunes.

I personally find the iTunes auto-add of ‘Songs of Innocence’ creepy and invasive. Give people a choice, don’t force it on them. Sheesh… — Mindy Ness (@aquadonia) September 12, 2014

Monday, Apple responded to the complaints, offering a way to remove the album from the iTunes store.

“Some customers asked for the ability to delete ‘Songs of Innocence’ from their library, so we set up www.itunes.com/soi-remove to let them easily do so,” said Apple spokesman Tom Neumayr.

To remove the album:

Go to www.itunes.com/soi-remove

Click ‘remove album’
