Some wonder whether the Obama administration is targeting a prominent critic.\n\n\u201cThis administration does not like Fox,\u201d said one retired officer, noting Mr. Obama\u2019s repeated criticism of the channel.\n\nDuring the George W. Bush administration, the Pentagon classified Mr. Simmons as a retired military analyst. He, like the others, received special war briefings from Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld. Mr. Simmons\u2018 Facebook page is stocked with photos of him with prominent Fox News personalities and conservative activists.\n\nIn late 2013, Mr. Clizbe and a second former government worker were circulating their findings that Mr. Simmons was a fraud.\n\nThe Times sent Mr. Simmons an email inquiry, to which he replied with a categorical denial and asserted that he had government files proving his covert CIA work. He said one of his two accusers was a \u201ctroubled former CIA contractor.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat means that he did something inside and was walked out of the gate,\u201d Mr. Simmons told The Times. \u201cThey also took his computer (his revelation). He\u2019s been under fire for some time on other issues listed on Google. I\u2019ve appeared on Fox since Fall, 2002. Deployed to [Afghanistan] for DOD. All of a sudden these two guys show up? Some of my colleagues are convinced that it is related to my outspoken membership on the Citizens Commission on Benghazi. I\u2019m not certain. It is angering and pathetic.\u201d\n\nHe said the conservative media \u201cwere all credible enough to recognize a false accusation and not publish. We do not know their motives.\u201d\n\nMr. Simmons added: \u201cThese two guys showed up out of the blue making those claims. We did not know they were working together until I ran an Intel Op against one of them and made the link to the other. I have been vetted at the very highest level of multiple agencies including DOD and SECDEF\u2019s office. There are many folks like me out there who cannot protect themselves because they did not keep Op files to prove activity. I did. CIA knows I\u2019m here.\u201d\n\nMr. Simmons\u2018 denial seemed plausible because the Pentagon had classified him as a retired military analyst and identified him as former Navy/CIA. He gained a security clearance and spent time at NATO headquarters in Afghanistan as an intelligence adviser.\n\nIn a third email to The Times, he cited the fact that he was a Pentagon-approved retired military analyst.\n\n\u201cPlease note. I\u2019m listed as CIA. DoD did the vetting,\u201d he said. \u201cI did not just miraculously show up at GITMO 3 times to assess the terrorists. DoD vetted me. Other members of the Citizens Commission on Benghazi are concerned that they may be attacked next. False accusations are difficult to defend especially from where I come from.\u201d\n\nPentagon representatives last week did not respond to queries.\n\nMr. Simmons\u2018 website states: \u201cWayne joined the U.S. Navy in 1973 where he was recruited by the Central Intelligence Agency to become part of an Outside Paramilitary Special Operations Group. He spearheaded Deep Cover Intel Ops against some of the world\u2019s most dangerous Drug Cartels and arms smugglers from Central and South America and the Middle East.\u201d\n\nIn 2012, Mr. Simmons co-wrote a novel, \u201cThe Natanz Directive,\u201d that carries this blurb from Mr. Rumsfeld: \u201cWayne Simmons doesn\u2019t just write it. He\u2019s lived it.\u201d\n\n\u2018Nothing rang true\u2019\n\nThe federal indictment says Mr. Simmons made up his biography. It charges him with seven counts of making a false statement, committing major fraud against the U.S. and wire fraud. If he is convicted of all the charges, he could face a 35-year prison sentence.\n\nThe indictment states that on two occasions he received a secret security clearance from the U.S. government by falsely stating a CIA background. The lies got him two jobs with two defense contractors in 2008-2009 and in 2010, the year he went to Afghanistan as an intelligence adviser.\n\nThe indictment also says in 2011 he swindled an unidentified woman out of $125,000 for a real estate investment that did not exist.\n\nAn Annapolis resident, Mr. Simmons was convicted on federal charges of illegal possession of a pistol and rifle. In rejecting his appeal, a federal court opinion referred to a previous felony conviction in Prince George\u2019s County, Maryland. Prosecutors said he explained away his arrests by falsely claiming the crimes were related to CIA work.\n\nMr. Clizbe, like Mr. Simmons, is a conservative pundit and author. But there was no chemistry between the two after they met in 2010.\n\nMr. Clizbe, whose work includes \u201cheadhunting\u201d for employers and vetting candidates, writes that he was immediately skeptical. He said that in late 2013 he wrote an unpublished article accusing Mr. Simmons of being a fake.\n\n\u201cI met, spoke with, corresponded with, and shared the results of my vetting with Fox News, other media figures, high-level CIA retirees, the Benghazi group Simmons was closely associated with, and many others,\u201d Mr. Clizbe said. \u201cNo one was interested in printing this story then. The \u2018conservative\u2019 media has huge problems. Wayne Simmons is a great poster boy for those problems.\u201d\n\nAs recently as April, Fox News radio identified Mr. Simmons as a \u201cFox News contributor.\u201d In a 2009 clip from Fox News, he called the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, \u201ca pathological liar\u201d during a segment on CIA interrogation techniques.\n\nFox News spokeswoman Carly Shanahan said Mr. Simmons was never more than a guest on the network and that the reference to him as a \u201cFox News contributor\u201d was an error. \u201cHe was never a paid commentator,\u201d she said Thursday.\n\nThe Washington Times learned of the accusation from a third party and then queried Mr. Simmons. He has appeared in four articles in The Times since the war on terrorism began; he was quoted as a military analyst in two reports on Afghanistan. He also co-wrote a Commentary article, and a review of his novel was published.\n\nMr. Clizbe\u2019s website says he himself was a CIA case officer in the 1990s and then a contractor after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.\n\nIn 2013, Mr. Clizbe wrote, \u201cI knew it within three minutes of meeting him: Wayne Simmons was a fraud.\n\n\u201cReal CIA operations officers can immediately categorize a colleague, as in any bureaucracy or highly structured organization,\u201d he wrote. \u201cA couple of butt-sniffing questions, and you put the guy in a box: When did you go to the farm? Where were you home-based? Where was your first tour? Did you do the war zone? When did you retire? Were you management? What were your targets? Did you know _____? Takes less than five minutes of conversation to have a clear assessment of your new friend. And it takes the same length of time to determine if your new friend is a fraud. Nothing Simmons talked about rang true. Nothing.\u201d\n\nMr. Simmons made the second of two court appearances Friday at U.S. District Court in Alexandria, Virginia. A magistrate ordered him held and appointed a public defender after Mr. Simmons said he lacked the funds to hire an attorney.\n\nIf the government charges are correct, it raises the questions: How did he receive a Defense Department security clearance if he fabricated his resume? And what did Mr. Simmons really do from 1973 to 2000?\n\n\u2022 Andrea Noble contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A conservative cable news pundit, whom federal prosecutors accused last week of fabricating a life story of being a former deep-cover CIA officer, now sits in jail, unable to publicly address the felony charges against him.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "A conservative cable news pundit, whom federal prosecutors accused last week of fabricating a life story of being a former deep-cover CIA officer, now sits in jail, unable to publicly address the felony charges against him.", "title": "Wayne Simmons, accused fraudster, says he has proof of CIA work", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/oct/18/wayne-simmons-accused-fraudster-says-he-has-proof-/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/10/19/CIA2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/10/19/CIA2.jpg", "description": "A conservative cable news pundit, whom federal prosecutors accused last week of fabricating a life story of being a former deep-cover CIA officer, now sits in jail, unable to publicly address the felo", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Wayne Simmons, accused fraudster, says he has proof of CIA work"}, "Author": "Rowan Scarborough", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Law Crime, Politics, Kent Clizbe, Wayne Shelby Simmons, Afghanistan"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8cd6\"", "article_summary": "In late 2013, Mr. Clizbe and a second former government worker were circulating their findings that Mr. Simmons was a fraud.\nMr. Clizbe, now backed by the U.S. Justice Department, says Mr. Simmons is a consummate con man who duped all of Washington.\nIn 2013, Mr. Clizbe wrote, \u201cI knew it within three minutes of meeting him: Wayne Simmons was a fraud.\nA magistrate ordered him held and appointed a public defender after Mr. Simmons said he lacked the funds to hire an attorney.\nHe said that in late 2013 he wrote an unpublished article accusing Mr. Simmons of being a fake."}
