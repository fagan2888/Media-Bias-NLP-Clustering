I believe that President Barack Obama and his administration have repeatedly lied to the American people. According to the Obamacare principle architect, Johnathan Gruber, the \u201cstupidity of the American voter was really critical to passing the legislation.\u201d Why did they have to rely on this type of deception to pass this law? We may be too busy trying to make a living to understand everything that goes on in Washington but we\u2019re not stupid.\n\nHillary Clinton deleted 30,000 emails that supposedly were personal in nature. Now we find out that some were so \u201ctop secret\u201d that they can\u2019t be disclosed. Is she also counting on the \u201cstupidity of the American people\u201d to continue her campaign?\n\nClinton is being investigated by the FBI for violating laws concerning national security. Her chief of staff walked out of her meeting with the FBI. Another one of her staff members, Bryan Pagliano, asserted his Fifth Amendment right not to appear before a select committee. Why are all these people afraid to speak? What are they hiding?\n\nObama has added almost $9 trillion to the federal debt. Our children and grandchildren will have to pay for this. The Democratic Party\u2019s solution is to spend more. This is simply unbelievable. For the sake of our country, I can only hope that voters will reject liberal policies that are destroying our country. Finally and most importantly, we as a people need to ask almighty God for forgiveness and direction.\n\nJuan Vega, McAllen", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "The Monitor", "description": "As Election Day nears, I can only hope that Democrats, for the sake of our country, take an honest look at what their party has become.
