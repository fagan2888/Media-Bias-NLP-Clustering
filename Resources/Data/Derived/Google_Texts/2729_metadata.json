The surgeon general has added to the list of smoking-related diseases before. Bladder cancer was added in 1990 and cervical cancer in 2004.\n\nThe report is not legally binding, but is broadly held as a standard for scientific evidence among researchers and policy makers.\n\n\u0093I thought the science was very well done and up to date,\u0094 said Dr Robert Wallace, a professor of epidemiology and internal medicine at the University of Iowa, who helped review the report.\n\nThe report comes 50 years after the pivotal 1964 surgeon general\u0092s report in which the government concluded for the first time that smoking caused lung cancer. That report was credited with starting to change public attitudes toward smoking, which has declined sharply. In 1965, about 43 per cent of adults were smokers; in 2012, about 18 per cent were.\n\nBut that decline has slowed in recent years, and the new report calls for stronger action in combating smoking. The report concluded that the evidence was insufficient to say that smoking caused prostate cancer. The evidence was suggestive, but not definite, that smoking causes breast cancer.\n\nWhile smoking causes most cases of lung cancer, it causes only a small fraction of liver and colorectal cancers. A current smoker is 25 times as likely to develop lung cancer as someone who has never smoked, but only about 1.5 times as likely to develop liver cancer.\n\n\u0093It is a fairly modest association, but because so many people smoke, it\u0092s still an important cause of these cancers,\u0094 said Neal Freedman, an epidemiologist at the National Cancer Institute.\n\nHe pointed out that", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Financial Express", "description": "Cigarette smoking has long known to cause lung cancer and heart disease.", "title": "Smoking causes diabetes, liver cancers, erectile dysfunction: Report", "url": "http://archive.financialexpress.com/news/smoking-causes-diabetes-liver-cancers-erectile-dysfunction-report/1219039", "image": "http://static.financialexpress.com/pic/uploadedImages/mediumImages/M_Id_457420_Smoking.jpg", "type": "article"}, "Last-Modified": "Sat Jan 18 2014. 14:37 hrs", "description": "Cigarette smoking has long known to cause lung cancer and heart disease.", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Smoking causes diabetes, liver cancers, erectile dysfunction: Report\",\r\n                \"link\": \"http://archive.financialexpress.com/news/smoking-causes-diabetes-liver-cancers-erectile-dysfunction-report/1219039\",\r\n                \"image_url\": \"http://static.financialexpress.com/pic/uploadedImages/mediumImages/M_Id_457420_Smoking.jpg\",\r\n                \"type\": \"post\",\r\n                \"post_id\": \"1219039\",\r\n                \"pub_date\": \"2014-01-18T14:37:10+05:30\",\r\n                \"section\": \"Health\",\r\n                \"author\": \"New York Times\",\r\n                \"tags\": [\"\"]\r\n               }", "author": "New York Times"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9559\"", "article_summary": "While smoking causes most cases of lung cancer, it causes only a small fraction of liver and colorectal cancers.\nSmoking has been known to be associated with these illnesses, but the report was the first time the federal government concluded that smoking causes them.\nIn a broad review of scientific literature, the US\u0092s top doctor has concluded that cigarette smoking \u0097 long known to cause lung cancer and heart disease \u0097 also causes diabetes, colorectal and liver cancers, erectile dysfunction and ectopic pregnancy.\nA current smoker is 25 times as likely to develop lung cancer as someone who has never smoked, but only about 1.5 times as likely to develop liver cancer.\nThe finding does not mean that smoking causes all cases of the health problems and diseases listed in the report, but that some of the cases would not have happened without smoking."}
