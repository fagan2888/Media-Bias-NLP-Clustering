Lew is now saying Congress will have to act to raise the nation\u2019s debt limit by the end of this month. That\u2019s a big shift from the last time the debt ceiling was raised, three and a half months ago. Then, the Congressional Budget Office predicted we\u2019d have enough money till June. But no. Thanks to Washington\u2019s addiction to out-of-control spending, the money will be gone by March.\n\nOnce again, Congress will have to debate a debt hike bill, and we will be treated to the usual circus. We\u2019ll hear cries of \u201cdefault!\u201d if fiscal conservatives even breathe a wish for spending reforms to reduce future borrowing, and \u201ccruelty!\u201d if they should actually propose some reforms.\n\nWhat should Congress do?\n\nFirst of all, ignore the D.C. malarkey. Spending reforms can\u2019t wait. The national debt has surpassed $17 trillion. If we don\u2019t at least freeze spending soon, interest payments on the debt will eventually consume all incoming tax receipts, and the government will go bankrupt \u2014 that is, if we don\u2019t experience a Greece-style economic collapse first. The time for spending cuts is now.\n\nAttaching real spending reforms to the debt limit isn\u2019t extreme, it\u2019s a Washington tradition \u2014 or was, before President Barack Obama.\n\nThe next debt bill should not be \u201cclean.\u201d It should cut spending. It should defund Obamacare or send a balanced-budget amendment to the states. At the very least, it should freeze spending, which would balance the budget in just four years.\n\nAs for the specter of default, it\u2019s time to call the left\u2019s bluff. The Treasury takes in far more than it needs to pay all our bondholders on time and in full. If Congress ever hits the debt ceiling, there will be no default; there will be a temporary cash crunch affecting non-debt-related payments while a bipartisan deal is negotiated. That\u2019s not the end of the world, and markets know it.\n\nBut the most important thing Congress should do is take back its constitutional powers.\n\nThat\u2019s right. Over the past three years, congressional Republicans have silently ceded the government\u2019s borrowing power to Obama.\n\nArticle 1 of the U.S. Constitution explicitly grants Congress\u2014not the president\u2014the power to control taxes, spending and borrowing. Yet, two recent GOP \u201creforms\u201d have effectively shifted the borrowing power to the president. That shift not only undermines what little fiscal restraint we have left, it fundamentally undermines the checks and balances our Founders deemed essential to preserving our liberty.\n\n1. The Boehner Substitution: The first reform came early last year, when Speaker John A. Boehner, R-Ohio, engineered the elimination of the dollar cap on the debt limit, substituting a date limit. Now the president can borrow as much as he wants, until a specific date, at which time a new dollar cap is automatically imposed. By itself, this idea isn\u2019t awful. It\u2019s supposed to give Congress more certainty about when the debt ceiling will be hit and stop the president from playing games with the date. But for reasons I\u2019ll explain, it doesn\u2019t work. Instead, it just amplifies the troubles caused by ...\n\n2. The McConnell Mechanism: The brainchild of Senate leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., this parliamentary device gives the president almost total authority to borrow without limit. Congress can only check the executive\u2019s awesome power when two-thirds of each chamber agree to pass a \u201cresolution of disapproval\u201d to reverse the president\u2019s actions \u2014 very unlikely.\n\nBoehner\u2019s elimination of the dollar cap essentially gives politicians a green light to cram as much spending as possible through before the deadline, while McConnell\u2019s mechanism gives them political cover to do so. They can now posture as anti-debt fiscal hawks, while avoiding the tough spending decisions.\n\nRight now, Beltway pundits predict Congress will pass a \u201cclean\u201d full-year extension of the debt ceiling, which is projected to cost at least $600 billion. Of course, thanks to the combination of the Boehner and McConnell \u201creforms,\u201d even that astronomical figure will not be binding.\n\nThe Boehner date cap won\u2019t work because the president has authority to take so-called extraordinary measures (i.e., to borrow from various federal trust funds). It\u2019s a power intended to help avert a government cash crunch, but it also renders a date cap ineffective.\n\nIt\u2019s time to stop. Stop overspending. Stop ignoring the Constitution. Stop shifting power to the president. The debt ceiling draweth nigh. Congress needs to take real steps to get spending under control. But first, it must take back the power of the purse.\n\nDean Clancy, a former senior White House budget official, is vice president for public policy at FreedomWorks.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Treasury Secretary Jacob J.
