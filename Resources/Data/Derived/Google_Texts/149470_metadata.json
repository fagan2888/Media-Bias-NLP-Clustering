Economists had anticipated economic growth of 1.6% in Q3.\n\nPersonal consumption grew 3.2%, just below the forecast for 3.3%.\n\nThis could all be revised in the next two estimates, due in November and December.\n\nThe Department of Commerce said in its release, \"The increase in real GDP in the third quarter primarily reflected positive contributions from personal consumption expenditures (PCE), state and local government spending, nonresidential fixed investment, exports, and residential fixed investment that were partly offset by negative contributions from private inventory investment.\"\n\nHuge cuts in energy-sector investment since the oil crash, and a drag from inventories, contributed to softening economic growth.\n\n\"Ex-inventories, this is a solid report,\" Pantheon Macroeconomics' Ian Shepherdson wrote in a client note. \"With inventories likely to be a much smaller drag on Q4 growth, the prospect of a 3% headline GDP number is very real.\"\n\nThe manufacturing sector also cooled after the stronger dollar, weaker global demand, and other factors weighed on production.\n\nIn the past few weeks, economists steadily lowered their estimates for growth for the quarter and the full year. They raised estimates on Wednesday, however, after the advance goods trade balance showed that the deficit shrank to $58.6 billion from $66.6 billion.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#185f7c", "sailthru.author": "Akin Oyedele", "application-name": "Business Insider", "twitter": {"description": "The advance estimate of gross domestic product, the value of all goods and services produced, was 1.5%.", "creator": "AkinOyedele", "url": "http://www.businessinsider.com/q3-gdp-october-29-2015-10", "image": "http://static3.businessinsider.com/image/54fdfdf26da811511aa836a8-506-253/america-slows.jpg", "title": "America slows", "site": "themoneygame", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.verticals": "moneygame,clusterstock", "linkedin": {"owner": "mid:1d5f7b"}, "sailthru.tags": "GDP, Akin Oyedele", "description": "The advance estimate of gross domestic product, the value of all goods and services produced, was 1.5%.", "author": "Akin Oyedele", "sailthru.date": "2015-10-29", "sailthru.title": "America slows", "theme-color": "#185f7c", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://static5.businessinsider.com/image/54f5b8c36da811163ddf0cf5-50-50/america-slows.jpg", "news_keywords": "GDP, Akin Oyedele", "tbi-image": "http://static4.businessinsider.com/image/54f5b8c36da811163ddf0cf5/america-slows.jpg", "fb": {"app_id": 155043519637}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://static1.businessinsider.com/assets/images/us/favicons/mstile-144x144.png?v=BI-US-2016-03-31", "date": "2015-10-29", "article": {"publisher": "businessinsider", "author": "http://www.businessinsider.com/author/akin-oyedele"}, "sailthru.description": "The advance estimate of gross domestic product, the value of all goods and services produced, was 1.5%.", "viewport": "width=1024", "og": {"site_name": "Business Insider", "description": "The advance estimate of gross domestic product, the value of all goods and services produced, was 1.5%.", "title": "America slows", "url": "http://www.businessinsider.com/q3-gdp-october-29-2015-10", "image": "http://static1.businessinsider.com/image/54fdfdf26da811511aa836a8-1190-625/america-slows.jpg", "type": "article"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Business Insider", "title": "America slows", "sailthru.image.full": "http://static4.businessinsider.com/image/54f5b8c36da811163ddf0cf5/america-slows.jpg", "tbi-vertical": "moneygame"}, "article_summary": "The advance estimate of the increase in gross domestic product, the value of all goods and services produced, was 1.5%.\nIn the past few weeks, economists steadily lowered their estimates for growth for the quarter and the full year.\n\"With inventories likely to be a much smaller drag on Q4 growth, the prospect of a 3% headline GDP number is very real.\"\nHuge cuts in energy-sector investment since the oil crash, and a drag from inventories, contributed to softening economic growth.\nThey raised estimates on Wednesday, however, after the advance goods trade balance showed that the deficit shrank to $58.6 billion from $66.6 billion."}
