Contributed Photo\n\nChico >>Today may be a celebration of motherhood, but for some mothers it\u2019s a badge they\u2019re not so sure about. Motherhood is an instant job that delivered more than they ever expected or were ready for \u2014 physically and mentally.\n\nBecoming a mother means joy, but it can also be a mental wallop as women deal with perinatal mood and anxiety disorders, said DeAnne Blankenship, who is part of a relatively new local organization called Mothers Strong.\n\nThe group was formed last year in hopes of helping mothers understand and deal with the joys and challenges of motherhood. Group members include mothers, individuals, therapists and representatives of local agencies that host supportive services from throughout Butte County.\n\nIt also put on Butte County\u2019s first \u201cmothers summit,\u201d held Saturday at Enloe Conference Center in Chico.\n\nThe group and the half-day conference \u201ccame about through a recognition there is a lack of services and awareness of perinatal mood and anxiety issues,\u201d said Blankenship, who is with the Chico office of the California Health Collaborative.\n\nThe California Health Collaborative held a couple of classes regarding women\u2019s mood issues in Fresno and Merced, which spun the idea for the summit.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a growing topic in the maternal world because it\u2019s a huge public health crisis,\u201d Blankenship said.\n\nCiting national data, Blankenship noted that studies show one in seven women may suffer from depression, a message that Mothers Strong is posting on signs on B-Line buses.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, depression during and after pregnancy is more than feeling a little down.\n\n\u201cDepression is more than just feeling \u2018blue\u2019 or \u2018down in the dumps\u2019 for a few days. It\u2019s a serious illness that involves the brain. With depression, sad, anxious or \u2018empty\u2019 feelings don\u2019t go away and interfere with day-to-day life and routines. These feelings can be mild to severe. The good news is that most people with depression get better with treatment.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not just a matter of feeling a little off, Blankenship says. It can affect a mother\u2019s ability to bond with her child or gets in the way of an adult relationship. It can lead to chronic depression and to behavior issues in a child, she said.\n\nNational headlines speak to the condition, with incidents of mothers harming or even killing their children and themselves.\n\nHelping women understand the complexities of their moods and depression was part of the reason for the free summit.\n\nSpeakers at the conference helped mothers discern their feelings and ways for relief.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhy there are so many instances of postpartum mood issues now compared to other generations isn\u2019t clear. Perhaps earlier generations had more support from families or women who were close, or had resources to read or turn to. Or it may be that the health industry is paying more attention and incidents are reported more frequently.\n\n\u201cWomen aren\u2019t growing up in large families of women. In areas where women are more isolated, in rural areas for example, the rate (of mothers with depression) is suspected to be higher than 20 percent,\u201d Blankenship said.\n\nPointing the way to resources was a goal of several dozen women representing local agencies, as well as mothers and professionals, who met monthly and were eventually able to assemble support groups in both Chico and Paradise that included health professionals and therapists to help. Mothers Strong was the result.\n\nWith the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, mental care can be covered along with physical care, Blankenship said.\n\nMothers Strong is also a resource for obstetricians, who Blankenship said have known about the issues for decades, but not really had many options for their patients.\n\nWhile there is no website nor regular meetings for mothers to attend yet, there is a Facebook page for Mothers Strong, as well as information on www.Butte211.org \u2014 a Butte County resource website.\n\nBlankenship stresses that agencies formed the foundation of Mothers Strong, but they want to see mothers, individuals and families come in to play a larger role in the organization.\n\nTo that end, information is available by calling 2-1-1 or the toll-free number 1-866-916-3566, and asking for information on the Mothers Strong program.\n\nContact reporter Laura Urseny at 896-7756.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Chico >>Today may be a celebration of motherhood, but for some mothers it\u2019s a badge they\u2019re not so sure about.
