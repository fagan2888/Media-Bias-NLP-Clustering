While many large, employer-sponsored insurance plans, along with Medicare, cover the surgeries, policies sold to small businesses and individual customers are governed by state rules, so coverage is more variable. The procedure, which essentially makes the stomach smaller, is one of a number of treatments offered to patients who are severely overweight. Nationally, about 200,000 such surgeries are performed annually, usually costing between $15,000 to $25,000.\n\nVirginia is among a handful of states, along with Georgia and Indiana, where laws that predate the health law require that bariatric treatment must be offered as an option for consumers, but not necessarily included in every plan sold to small businesses and people who buy their own coverage. But bariatric surgery is not a required benefit in the plans selected by Virginia or Georgia as the standard for what must be sold through the new marketplaces.\n\nVirginia\u2019s pricing \u201cis a barrier for people getting coverage,\u201d Joe Nadglowski, president and CEO of the Florida-based advocacy group Obesity Action Coalition. \u201cSome of the decisions that insurers make around bariatric surgery seem not to be based on economics or health, but are often more based on stigma and bias.\u201d\n\nOne mid-level policy from insurer Optima that covers the treatment, for example, is priced at $1,858 a month for a 27-year-old, but the same plan from the same insurer is $285 without the rider. Similar plans by other insurers, including Aetna, Coventry One and Innovation Health, range from $1,100 a month to $1,500, well above what the insurers charge for plans without the rider.\n\nA spokesman for Blue Cross Blue Shield of Georgia said that insurer is not offering riders that cover the surgery in its policies sold in the new marketplaces.\n\nUnder the health law, benefit packages must include 10 broad categories of care, including hospital coverage, maternity care, prescription drugs and mental health services. But states were given some leeway in choosing what else to include in that list. Along with Virginia, 27 other states chose benchmark policies that do not cover the surgical treatment for obesity, according to an analysis by the obesity coalition.\n\nMaryland chose a benchmark plan that does require coverage, reflecting its longstanding law. A Maryland Health Care Commission report from last year estimates the state\u2019s mandate to cover treatment for severe obesity added about 0.4 percent to the cost of an individual health policy, far below the 600 percent differential seen in some of the plans with riders in Virginia.\n\nMaryland Plans \u2018More Affordable\u2019\n\nIn states like Maryland where the cost of surgical treatment for obesity is included in all plans, the premiums are \u201cmore affordable than the Virginia plans with the add-on bariatric coverage, which drives up the price for those specific plans,\u201d said Aetna spokeswoman Cynthia Michener.\n\nSome question whether Virginia insurers may be \u201cadhering to the letter of the state law but not the spirit of the federal law,\u201d said Deborah Chollet, a senior fellow at Mathematica Policy Research, a nonpartisan research firm in Washington.\n\nThat\u2019s because the federal law says insurers cannot reject patients with medical conditions, nor charge them more, starting Jan. 1.

Policies that include bariatric surgery as an add-on have been offered for years, Cindrich said, noting, however, that they are \u201can expensive offering, which has kept it from becoming more popular.\u201d Similar riders for maternity care were often seen in policies sold nationally to consumers who buy their own coverage, said Mathematica\u2019s Chollet. \u201cThe difference in the cost of a plan with pregnancy coverage and those without was essentially the full cost of a normal delivery,\u201d she said, noting that the health law requires insurers to cover maternity care, starting Jan. 1. Riders for specific conditions or treatments are \u201cessentially a pre-payment plan\u201d for the treatment, Chollet said.  While they may simply reflect Virginia\u2019s law, the riders could also be seen as an attempt by insurers to avoid enrolling overweight patients, who are likely to have other health problems.\u00a0  Insurers may be thinking, \u201cwhy put out the welcome mat for people, when we can make bariatric surgery optional?\u201d Chollet said.
