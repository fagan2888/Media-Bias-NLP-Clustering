Car shopping is still very painful (further evidenced by surveys continuously showing low trust levels for dealers); and 2. While our own customers trust us a lot, they have told us repeatedly that our service isn't unique. Plenty of sites provide fairly comprehensive information these days; the alternatives to Edmunds.com are good enough.\" See Edmunds Price Promise at technology.edmunds.com\n\nLogin required We have used your information to see if you have a subscription with us.

Edmunds.com, the premier resource for car shopping and automotive information, says that if you don't already, you will be able to soon.\"\n\nBy \"belonging to Edmunds.com \u0097 much like being an Amazon Prime customer \u0097 (consumers) will have a substantially easier time\" at dealerships; they \"will get what they want, from sales personnel they want, in a manner (they) can trust,\" Berkowitz wrote in a blog on the site.\n\nBerkowitz led Edmunds.com through a strategic shift that made car buying easier. The company, already established and valued as a free car research stop on the road to buying a car, is transforming itself \u0097 strategically and through a site redesign launched Oct. 15 \u0097 into a unique car shopping destination: a place where car shoppers can trust dealers.\n\n\"In conjunction with our dealer partners, we offer actual prices on hundreds of thousands of cars -\u0097 in industry parlance, on specific pieces of inventory. Our dealer partners \u0097- in making the Edmunds Price Promise (at edmunds.com/price-promise.html) \u0097 are promising our customers they will honor that price when presented with a physical or digital certificate for that car, and that promise is also backed by Edmunds.com. We track each and every case to ensure those promises are being upheld,\" wrote Berkowitz.\n\nSince the Price Promise pilot launched in February, rolling out to the whole country in June, Edmunds.com found enrolled dealers ratings and review scores have risen 10 percent.

These shoppers look at 150 percent more inventory pages. One-third of all Price Promise deals close within two days of the certificate download. Price Promise leads close 15 percent faster than any other type.\n\n\"Trust levels and satisfaction levels inspired by the partnership with Edmunds.com are tangible and measurable,\" wrote Berkowitz.\n\nEdmunds.com was named \u0097 along with TripAdvisor, Zagat and OpenTable \u0097 one of the four most trusted prominent online review sites, according to Maritz Research's 2013 Online Customer Review Study.", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "Tulsa World", "description": "Dear Action Line: Is theEdmunds.comcar shopping service guaranteeing that buyers will get the prices promised them while car shopping at dealerships?\u0097M.G., Tulsa.", "title": "Action Line: Edmunds.com backing up its Price Promise", "url": "http://www.tulsaworld.com/business/actionline/action-line-edmunds-com-backing-up-its-price-promise/article_6065355a-243e-5650-882f-3c36beabc7fe.html", "image": "http://www.tulsaworld.com/app/tulsa_world_ogimage.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@tulsaworld", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"app_id": 288003941350366}, "keywords": "edmunds,percent,com,car,price,promise,trust,berkowitz,shopping,action,actionline,business", "news_keywords": "edmunds,percent,com,car,price,promise,trust,berkowitz,shopping,action,actionline,business", "description": "Dear Action Line: Is theEdmunds.comcar shopping service guaranteeing that buyers will get the prices promised them while car shopping at dealerships?\u0097M.G., Tulsa."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd06e5\"", "article_summary": "Dear Action Line: Is the Edmunds.com car shopping service guaranteeing that buyers will get the prices promised them while car shopping at dealerships?\nOther impressive Price Promise program results:60 percent more car shoppers are submitting their personal information on Edmunds.com in exchange for Price Promise certificates.\nOne-third of all Price Promise deals close within two days of the certificate download.\nSee Edmunds Price Promise at technology.edmunds.comLogin required We have used your information to see if you have a subscription with us.\nPrice Promise leads close 15 percent faster than any other type."}
