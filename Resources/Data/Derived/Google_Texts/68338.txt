SALEM, Ore. (KOIN 6) — For 10 years, the Salem Free Clinics has provided free care and medicine to an average of 500 people a month. They recently treated their 30,000th patient.

Volunteer dentists, doctors, nurses and specialists have helped the uninsured and underinsured for a decade.

The clinic’s John McConville told KOIN 6 News they have at times been so packed with people needing free care their waiting time was sometimes three weeks.

But the implementation of the Affordable Care Act provided a welcome change, he said.

“By more people being insured now and able to access healthcare in other areas, that has freed up the backlog here at our clinics so we can see people in a more timely fashion,” McConville said.

Still, many need to be seen. In Polk County alone, 4000 people still have no health insurance. As long as that’s the case, Salem Free Clinics will be there.

“Case by case, we love the individuals and the patients that are served,” he said.
