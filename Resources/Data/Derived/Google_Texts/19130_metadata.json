In Kentucky, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell trounced tea party-backed businessman Matt Bevin by 25 points, setting up a matchup with Democrat Alison Lundergan Grimes, one that could be the most expensive Senate race in the country. In Georgia, two candidates favored by the GOP establishment \u2014 former Dollar General chief executive David Perdue and 11-term Rep. Jack Kingston \u2014 advanced to a July 22 runoff. And in Oregon, pro-abortion rights pediatric neurosurgeon Monica Wehby took 51 percent of the vote to defeat conservative state Rep. Jason Conger in the GOP primary.\n\nStars aligning: Republicans need to gain a net of six seats to take back control of the Senate, and so far, the pieces are falling into place exactly as they want them to for the party to have a shot at accomplishing its goal. Earlier this month, Thom Tillis claimed the GOP Senate nomination in North Carolina, avoiding a potentially damaging runoff and giving the establishment its top pick to challenge Democratic Sen. Kay Hagan. McConnell\u2019s victory was expected, but his margin may signal less concern about conservatives coming home in November. Perdue or Kingston is not the outcome Democrats would have hoped for in Georgia to give their candidate, philanthropist Michelle Nunn, the best chance to win. Oregon remains a long shot for Republicans, but Wehby helps Republican chances of unseating Democratic Sen. Jeff Merkley in a big wave.\n\nWhy anti-Washington hasn\u2019t been enough: Let\u2019s get this out of the way: running on congressional experience is not an asset. In Pennsylvania, Rep. Allyson Schwartz, D-Pa., and former Rep. Marjorie Margolies, D-Pa. (Chelsea Clinton\u2019s mother-in-law, endorsed by the Clintons) lost in their races last night, for example (though Washington experience may not have been their only problem). Ex-Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga., finished second in his comeback bid, but advanced to the runoff. McConnell had to pour a lot of resources into defeating Bevin. And outside groups like the Chamber of Commerce came to the rescue of people like Reps. Mike Simpson and Jack Kingston. Rep. Bill Shuster, R-Pa., pulled out a closer-than-he-would-have-liked primary, taking 53 percent of the vote. But despite the deeply anti-Washington mood that shows up in polling, the power of the incumbency is still very strong. In fact, not a single House or Senate incumbent has lost yet this cycle. They are 139-for-139, including 45-for-45 last night.\n\n\u2018Keep the bums in\u2019: As the Los Angeles Times\u2019 Mark Z. Barabak wrote earlier this year, \u201cA keep-the-bums-in mood may prevail in midterm election.\u201d How can it be that with Congress\u2019 approval ratings in single digits in some polls that this is the case? Because the House, for example, is already incredibly polarized and most people blame the other guy and the other side. As Stu Rothenberg told Barabak: \u201cRepublicans blame liberals and big government and Obama; Democrats are upset because they think the tea party won\u2019t allow anything to get done \u2014 Republicans are too extreme.\u201d Both Democrats Grimes and Nunn are running on Washington dissatisfaction. That\u2019s the theme of Grimes\u2019 first general election ad, up Wednesday. Next week, by the way, COULD see the first incumbent lose in Ralph Hall of Texas. His opponent has running on Hall being in Congress too long \u2014 he\u2019s the oldest member of Congress at 91. Reps. Mike Honda, D-Calif., and Charlie Rangel, D-N.Y., are also vulnerable and their races take place later in the cycle.\n\nTom Wolf and the power of (early) positive ads: The Democrat who might have had the best night Tuesday was Tom Wolf, who cruised to victory over Schwartz and two others in Pennsylvania\u2019s gubernatorial primary, winning 58 percent of the vote. Buoyed by $10 million of his own money and a series of positive television ads, Wolf, the owner of a kitchen cabinet maker, will take on vulnerable Republican Gov. Tom Corbett in November. Wolf jumped from single digits to front-runner in the span of a few months, thanks in large part to the TV spots. The L.A. Times notes that Wolf aired 1,800 commercials in late January and early February, when he was the only candidate on the air.\n\nObama meets with Shinseki: President Barack Obama meets with embattled Veterans Affairs Secretary Eric Shinseki and White House deputy chief of staff Rob Nabors, assigned to the VA, Wednesday morning at the White House. The closed-door meeting comes amid a VA scandal in which it\u2019s alleged that veterans may have died waiting for treatment. Nabors heads to Phoenix tonight to visit one of the VA facilities in question. Meanwhile, House Republicans are pushing what it\u2019s calling the \u201cVA Accountability Act,\u201d which Boehner\u2019s office says would \u201cgive the current or future VA Secretary the tools he needs to discipline or fire senior managers.\u201d But it is also putting out a research document highlighting what it calls \u201cthe gap between the President\u2019s rhetoric and reality on veterans\u2019 issues.\u201d\n\nDaily Presidential Trivia: On this day in 1954, the Senate rejected President Eisenhower\u2019s plan for 18-year-olds\u2019 voting rights.
