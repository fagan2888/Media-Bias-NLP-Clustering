Of the 2.2 million individuals who enrolled in coverage from October to December, estimates suggest that 11 percent were previously without insurance, while the majority shifted from other sources of coverage.\n\n\u201cOur big question is, May 15 we have to submit rates for 2015. Are they going to be double-digit [increases] or are we going to get beat up because they\u2019re double-digit or are we just going to have to pull out of the program?\u201d Bertolini asked in a Squawk Box interview. \u201cThose questions can\u2019t be answered until we see the population we have today. And we really don\u2019t have a good view on that.\u201d Watch it:\n\nBut fears of insurers abandoning Obamacare are alarmist, if not wholly unwarranted. The uninsured have until March 31 to sign-up for coverage and as Bertolini himself admitted, it\u2019s currently \u201ctoo early\u201d to know what kind of costumers the company will attract. \u201cWe don\u2019t have data on who enrolled, where they enrolled, how old are they, what kind of comorbidities do they have and so until we get data on the individuals it\u2019s a little premature to raise the earnings title,\u201d he told CNBC, adding that the law represents a very small part of Aetna\u2019s business.\n\nKaiser Health News reported in June that Aetna and some other large insurers have proceeded cautiously in the online marketplaces, \u201cevaluating markets state by state and in some cases region by region within the state to assess the viability of all the different pieces.\u201d Companies are adopting a wait-and-see approach to avoid taking on sicker enrollees who are initially more motivated to sign up for coverage, but seek to participate in the market in the future.\n\n\u201cWe have not increased our exposure, but we have put down an option to play in the marketplace and to learn because we believe\u2026public exchanges will be much larger in the marketplace in the long term,\u201d Bertolini told investors on Dec. 12. \u201cThey are not going away. They are here to stay. We need to figure out on how to play in them, and this option that we\u2019ve put down this year is our way to learn and to find opportunity in the public exchange market going forward.\u201d He admitted that enrollment is currently \u201clower than everybody expected\u201d but stressed, \u201cmy view is that by 2015, if we get it fixed right, it will be a new start, and 5 years from now, nobody will remember it.\u201d\n\nBertolini, and many other insurers, were even more bullish during the JP Morgan health care conference in January, telling the audience \u201cI\u2019m not alarmed [by the demographics of the current enrollees]. They\u2019re better than I thought they would have been.\u201d\n\nThough Affordable Care Act plans only make up 3 percent of Aetna\u2019s revenue, Bertolini stressed that in the long term, \u201cWe believe there will be 25 million members on public exchanges and $75 billion in premium.\u201d \u201c[I]t\u2019s not the marketplace we can ignore. And we are participating to play in a retail market, which includes public exchanges and private exchanges. We believe that\u2019s the model of the future. We want to drive our retail market in the future and so our participation is important.\u201d\n\nAetna recently raised its revenue projects for 2014 by a billion dollars \u2014 from $53 billion to at least $54 billion \u2014 citing its success in attracting more enrollees into Medicare Advantage.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "Fears of insurers abandoning Obamacare are unwarranted.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "Fears of insurers abandoning Obamacare are unwarranted.", "title": "Why Health Insurers Aren\u2019t About To Pull Out Of Obamacare", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/health/2014/01/23/3195491/nations-largest-insurers-pulling-obamacare/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/110131_aetna_insurance_ap_328.jpeg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Fears of insurers abandoning Obamacare are unwarranted.", "creator": "@@igorvolsky", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/110131_aetna_insurance_ap_328-321x214.jpg", "title": "Why Health Insurers Aren\u2019t About To Pull Out Of Obamacare", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-health", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/110131_aetna_insurance_ap_328.jpeg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/110131_aetna_insurance_ap_328.jpeg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2014-01-23T09:31:19+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/ivolsky"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcdb57\"", "article_summary": "Health Why Health Insurers Aren\u2019t About To Pull Out Of Obamacare CREDIT:On Wednesday, Aetna CEO Mark Bertolini told CNBC that the nation\u2019s third largest insurance company may stop offering coverage in the Affordable Care Act\u2019s new health care marketplaces if the law does not attract more uninsured enrollees.\nAnd we really don\u2019t have a good view on that.\u201d Watch it:But fears of insurers abandoning Obamacare are alarmist, if not wholly unwarranted.\nAnd we are participating to play in a retail market, which includes public exchanges and private exchanges.\n\u201cOur big question is, May 15 we have to submit rates for 2015.\n\u201cThose questions can\u2019t be answered until we see the population we have today."}
