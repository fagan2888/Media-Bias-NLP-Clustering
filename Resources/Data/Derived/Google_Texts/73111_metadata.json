Our outlook also remains prudent in light of the dynamic nature of the marketplace, and we believe this is a point from which we will grow in the future.\u201d\n\nWellPoint and its subsidiaries are selling policies in 14 states\u2019 Obamacare marketplaces. Swedish has consistently been bullish about Obamacare enrollment \u2014 which surpassed five million private health plan signups earlier this week \u2014 both for this year and over the coming decade.\n\n\u201cDespite the near-term uncertainty, we believe exchanges will be growing as a big part of the market over time,\u201d said Swedish in a January health care conference sponsored by JP Morgan. \u201cWe saw a sizable uptick at the end of December, concurrent with the first enrollment deadline. And we expect a similar bump in March, in front of the second primary enrollment deadline.\u201d\n\nOther insurance executives, including the CEOs of Aetna, Cigna, and west coast insurer Health Net, have expressed a similar sense of optimism.\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office (CBO) recently revised its projection for first-year private Obamacare enrollment from seven million to six million after Healthcare.gov\u2019s disastrous launch. Thanks to an ongoing enrollment surge this month, the White House may achieve \u2014 or even exceed \u2014 the six million mark by the March 31 deadline for 2014 coverage.\n\nCBO expects the private state and federal marketplaces to have more than 24 million customers by the end of the decade.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "WellPoint has gained more than a million new customers, largely thanks to the health reform law.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "WellPoint has gained more than a million new customers, largely thanks to the health reform law.", "title": "Insurance Giant Raises Its Profit Forecast Amid Surging Obamacare Enrollment", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/health/2014/03/21/3417434/wellpoint-profit-forecast-obamacare/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/apimages_wellpoint.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "WellPoint has gained more than a million new customers, largely thanks to the health reform law.", "creator": "@the_sy_guy", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/apimages_wellpoint-321x214.jpg", "title": "Insurance Giant Raises Its Profit Forecast Amid Surging Obamacare Enrollment", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-health", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/apimages_wellpoint.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/apimages_wellpoint.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2014-03-21T11:07:45+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1a72\"", "article_summary": "Health Insurance Giant Raises Its Profit Forecast Amid Surging Obamacare Enrollment CREDIT: AP Photo/Michael Conroy Insurance giant WellPoint's headquarters in Indianapolis, IndianaWellPoint, the insurance giant that encompasses the Anthem and Blue Cross Blue Shield brands, has raised its 2014 profit forecast after gaining more than a million new customers largely thanks to the Affordable Care Act.\nThe Congressional Budget Office (CBO) recently revised its projection for first-year private Obamacare enrollment from seven million to six million after Healthcare.gov\u2019s disastrous launch.\nSwedish has consistently been bullish about Obamacare enrollment \u2014 which surpassed five million private health plan signups earlier this week \u2014 both for this year and over the coming decade.\n\u201cAs such, we are raising our 2014 earnings outlook\u2026 Our updated outlook reflects solid growth in membership, revenue and operating earnings.\nCBO expects the private state and federal marketplaces to have more than 24 million customers by the end of the decade."}
