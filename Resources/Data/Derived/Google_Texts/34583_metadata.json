Photo: Reuters\n\nIt has become an annoying habit for American politicians to air their \u201cconcern\u201d about human rights in Vietnam.\n\nThe latest episode has many Congressmen grappling with a vexing question: Should Vietnam be part of the US-led 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership [TPP] \u2013 touted as the \u201cmost progressive free trade agreement in our nation\u2019s history\u201d by President Barack Obama, given Vietnam\u2019s human rights record?\n\nObama has been so desperate to push the TPP through Congress before he concludes his term that his administration has been trying to talk the full house into believing that the pact would play a crucial role in improving Vietnam\u2019s record. Oh, the irony!\n\nThe US has been striving to show the world that it is an ardent promoter of human rights. But with the TPP, it threatens to turn traitor to its own seemingly lofty cause.\n\nThere has been growing concern that the TPP will benefit and protect the profits of medical and pharmaceutical corporations without considering the imminent harmful effects on human health.\n\nAccording to documents released by WikiLeaks -- and confirmed as authentic by several US politicians -- America\u2019s TPP negotiators have spent years pushing for provisions that would, in effect, constrain affordable access to life-saving drugs. The US has asked signatory nations to honor US drug patents and marketing monopolies for even longer than many already do.\n\nr evealed the Obama administration is backing off of drug-price protections for Big Pharma. But as The New York Times reported, \u201cAmerican negotiators are still pressing participating governments to open the process that sets reimbursement rates for drugs and medical devices,\u201d health activists are adamant that these mechanisms would still inhibit the development of affordable drugs, particularly in developing countries like Vietnam, where the average income is less than US$5 a day. The most recent document evealed the Obama administration is backing off of drug-price protections for Big Pharma.

That America is not a place where we simply turn away from the sick. Or turn our backs on the tired. The poor, the huddled masses. It\u2019s a place sustained by the idea that I am my brother\u2019s keeper and I am my sister\u2019s keeper.\u201d\n\nIf Obama really meant it, and does not think only Americans deserve benevolence, let us hope that his pet project, the TPP, will not \u201cturn away from the sick\u201d or \u201cturn its backs on the tired, the poor, the huddled masses\u201d in developing countries that are likely to be part of the pact.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Let us hope that President Barack Obama does not think only Americans deserve benevolence", "og": {"site_name": "Thanh Nien Daily", "description": "Let us hope that President Barack Obama does not think only Americans deserve benevolence", "title": "US politicians\u2019 condescension: Vietnam could put them out of their misery by binning TPP", "url": "http://www.thanhniennews.com/commentaries/us-politicians-condescension-vietnam-could-put-them-out-of-their-misery-by-binning-tpp-46945.html", "image": "http://static.thanhniennews.com/Uploaded/andien/2015_06_21/tpp1_UPTP.JPG", "type": "article"}, "robots": "INDEX,FOLLOW", "keywords": "Vietnam, US, Trans-Pacific Partnership, medicine prices", "article": {"section": "Opinion", "published_time": "2015-06-21T22:00:00T+07:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=yes", "news_keywords": "Vietnam, US, Trans-Pacific Partnership, medicine prices"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbeb4\"", "article_summary": "Photo: ReutersIt has become an annoying habit for American politicians to air their \u201cconcern\u201d about human rights in Vietnam.\nThe US has been striving to show the world that it is an ardent promoter of human rights.\nThe most recent document evealed the Obama administration is backing off of drug-price protections for Big Pharma.\nThe US claims to promote human rights and dignity, but the TPP unquestionably promotes profits over life.\nr evealed the Obama administration is backing off of drug-price protections for Big Pharma."}
