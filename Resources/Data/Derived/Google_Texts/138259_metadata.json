Bush, Iraq war, isis, Media Criticism, New York Times, Paul Krugman, Politics News\n\nFrank Bruni is mad. The New York Times columnist thinks it\u2019s high time that Obama\u2019s defenders stopped blaming George W. Bush for all the problems in the world. Sure, Bush made a mess of things, but that was like six or seven whole years ago. \u201cWhenever Barack Obama seems in danger of falling, do we have to hear that George W. Bush made the cliff?\u201d Bruni complains. And to be honest, he\u2019s sort of got a point \u2014 though not the one he thinks.\n\nHere\u2019s how Bruni puts it:\n\nIt happened with the economy. For the president\u2019s staunchest defenders, legitimate questions about whether the stimulus was wisely crafted and whether Obamacare was rushed took a back seat to lamentations over the damage that his predecessor had done. Obama wasn\u2019t perfect, but at least he wasn\u2019t Bush.\n\nBut the real problem here was not that Obama supporters attacked Bush. It was that Obama himself did not.\n\nThe stimulus was poorly crafted \u2014 more than a third of it was composed of tax cuts (the ill-considered be-all and end-all of Bush\u2019s earlier $170 billion stimulus program), which delivered far less bang for the buck than additional spending would \u2014 and a prime reason for that was Obama\u2019s desire to partner with Republicans, rather than blaming them for the disaster he\u2019d inherited from Bush. A fat lot of good that did him: He got zero votes from House Republicans in return.\n\nAn even worse problem was that the stimulus was too small \u2014 about half the size that it needed to be, as Paul Krugman noted at the time. But Obama was not about to blast Republicans like Susan Collins and Olympia Snowe for demanding that the slightly larger Democratic House-passed package be scaled back. He praised them for their bipartisanship! And why not? Even as the economy was worsening week by week before he took office, Obama was preoccupied with plans for a \u201cfiscal responsibility summit\u201d to strike a \u201cgrand bargain,\u201d cutting Medicare and Social Security in return for modest tax increases \u2014 something totally at odds with how he had run for office. There were multiple signals from the very start that Republicans weren\u2019t going to cooperate on anything, but still Obama refused to place blame where it unmistakably belonged.\n\nWhen it comes to Obamacare, Bruni\u2019s sense of the problems involved is even further off the mark. Obamacare wasn\u2019t rushed, it was nearly stalled to death by bad-faith Republican negotiations in the Senate. Obamacare\u2019s origins trace back to the Heritage Foundation, including the individual mandate. It was modeled more specifically on RomneyCare. The bill itself included hundreds of GOP proposals, and Obama bailed on the key Democratic proposal, the public option, falsely claiming he\u2019d never campaigned on it. There was absolutely nothing of a partisan rush job about it.\n\nNothing about healthcare reform had much of anything to do with Bush, of course. But that\u2019s no reason to let Bruni\u2019s myths go unrefuted. More to the point, it underscores the broader problem with Obama: He repeatedly bends over backward searching for \u201ccommon ground\u201d with Republicans, only to get the rug pulled out from under him. Once again, it\u2019s not that Obama\u2019s supporters criticize Republicans too much; it\u2019s that Obama himself criticizes them far too little.\n\nOf course, what\u2019s got Bruni really steamed at this point isn\u2019t domestic policy:\n\nAnd with the Middle East, those defenders sometimes turn Bush\u2019s epic mistakes into Obama\u2019s hall pass. Perhaps he hasn\u2019t figured out what\u2019s right, but he isn\u2019t guilty of the original wrong, which is constantly being litigated anew, as if a fresh verdict on the events of 2003 could alter the challenges and stakes of 2014. On Tuesday there was another spasm of this. As Congress debated the escalation of airstrikes against Islamic extremists, Rep. Lloyd Doggett, D-Texas, digressed to inveigh against \u201cthe wholly unnecessary Bush-Cheney invasion of Iraq,\u201d a bell that was rung 111/2 years ago and can\u2019t be un-rung now.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The New York Times wants us to forget how we got here.
