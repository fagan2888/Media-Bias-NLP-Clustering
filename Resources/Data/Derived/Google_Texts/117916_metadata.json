Orrin Hatch declared taxpayers are being scammed by a flaw in Obamacare, and it\u2019s happening right under the government\u2019s nose. He predicted people will be shocked by what they hear in his hearing room Thursday when the Government Accountability Office (GAO) releases troubling findings from its year-long undercover investigation of the federal healthcare exchanges.\n\n\u201cBad actors can game the system. It\u2019s an example of gross mismanagement,\u201d Hatch, R-Utah, said in an interview with ABC News between Senate votes.\n\nLast year, the GAO set up a \u201csecret shopper\u201d undercover investigation. The agency created 12 fake identities to attempt to obtain healthcare premium subsidies through the HealthCare.gov website. Over the internet and on the telephone, the federal exchange approved 11 of the 12 fraudulent applications, according to the report.\n\nThe government then doled out $2,500 per month or $30,000 per year in credits for insurance policies for these fabricated people.\n\nThe chief GAO investigator Seto Bagdoyan will testify Thursday that the website\u2019s document processor is not required to detect fraud. Undercover investigators supplied fabricated documents, including proof of income and citizenship, even fake Social Security numbers which were accepted with no questions asked.\n\nHatch says he\u2019s appalled that federal contractors authenticated the documents, allowing taxpayers to be swindled out of thousands of dollars.\n\nWhat makes Hatch really mad is that the scam is still going on. Even though GAO presented its undercover investigation at a hearing last year, the agency re-enrolled the 11 fictitious applicants this year, never getting detected by so-called system safeguards. In one case, GAO did receive a letter threatening to cancel coverage on one of its fake applicants. But guess what? Nothing happened. Both the coverage and the financial credits continued.\n\nA few months ago, half of the fictitious applicants received notices that they were being terminated for failing to submit documentation with their re-enrollment. Investigators finally thought their scam was uncovered. But when investigators called the exchange, they were able to reinstate 10 fake applicants and get even higher subsidy amounts, the GAO report says.\n\nThe Department of Health and Human Services did not respond to a call from ABC News, but reported to the GAO that there was \u201cno indication of a meaningful level of fraud.\u201d\n\nHatch\u2019s Democratic counterpart on the Finance Committee, Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, pointed out that more than 100,000 have been eliminated from the Obamacare rolls for fake documentation.\n\nRead the full GAO report HERE.", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "How 11 Fake Obamacare Patients Scammed Taxpayers", "description": "The General Accountability Office will release on Thursday July 16, 2015, the results from its year-long undercover investigation of the Obamacare healthcare exchanges.", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 ABC News Internet Ventures", "author": "ABC News", "og": {"site_name": "ABC News", "description": "The General Accountability Office will release on Thursday July 16, 2015, the results from its year-long undercover investigation of the Obamacare healthcare exchanges.", "title": "How 11 Fake Obamacare Patients Scammed Taxpayers", "url": "http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/11-fake-obamacare-patients-scammed-taxpayers-year-counting/story?id=32473160", "image": "http://a.abcnews.go.com/images/US/HT_adrienne_affordable_care_tk_131113_16x9_992.jpg", "type": "article"}, "Date": "2015-07-15", "twitter": {"description": "The General Accountability Office will release on Thursday July 16, 2015, the results from its year-long undercover investigation of the Obamacare healthcare exchanges.", "title": "How 11 Fake Obamacare Patients Scammed Taxpayers", "url": "http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/11-fake-obamacare-patients-scammed-taxpayers-year-counting/story?id=32473160", "app": {"url": {"ipad": "abcnewsipad://link/story,32473160", "iphone": "abcnewsiphone://link/story,32473160", "googleplay": "android-app://com.abc.abcnews/abcnews/abcnews.go.com/Politics/11-fake-obamacare-patients-scammed-taxpayers-year-counting/story?id=32473160"}, "name": {"ipad": "ABC News", "iphone": "ABC News", "googleplay": "ABC News"}, "id": {"ipad": 306934135, "iphone": 300255638, "googleplay": "com.abc.abcnews"}}, "site": "@ABC", "image": "http://a.abcnews.go.com/images/US/HT_adrienne_affordable_care_tk_131113_4x3t_240.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "index, follow", "DC.date.issued": "2015-07-15", "al": {"ipad": {"url": "abcnewsipad://link/story,32473160", "app_store_id": 380520716, "app_name": "ABC News for iPad"}, "web": {"url": "http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/11-fake-obamacare-patients-scammed-taxpayers-year-counting/story?id=32473160"}, "android": {"url": "android-app://com.abc.abcnews/abcnews/abcnews.go.com/Politics/11-fake-obamacare-patients-scammed-taxpayers-year-counting/story?id=32473160", "app_name": "ABC News Breaking Latest News", "package": "com.abc.abcnews"}, "iphone": {"url": "abcnewsiphone://link/story,32473160", "app_store_id": 300255638, "app_name": "ABC News - Breaking US & World News"}}, "Last-Modified": "2015-07-15 19:24:13", "fb": {"admins": 704409894, "app_id": 4942312939}, "keywords": "Affordable Healthcare Act, Obamacare, politics news, election news, political news, political news articles", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Affordable Healthcare Act, Obamacare"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1fbb\"", "article_summary": "An angry Sen.
