It\u2019ll measure care in terms of what it costs health plans, instead of what it means for patients\u2019 lives.\n\nThat it\u2019s being developed under the auspices of the American Society for Clinical Oncology, or ASCO, the world\u2019s leading oncology association, is a grim warning about the state of organized medicine.\n\nThe app will use an algorithm like those many health plans apply to limit access to innovative treatments. Wellpoint Inc., for one, measures cost-effectiveness by comparing the benefits, side effects and costs of various treatments for specific types of cancer. The ASCO app uses the same benchmarks.\n\nThat\u2019s no coincidence. At ASCO\u2019s national conference, Dr. Lee Newcomer, United Healthcare\u2019s medical director, said the \u201cmotives [of insurers] are viewed with suspicion when it comes to deciding whether a treatment is cost-effective. So having ASCO play a key role in establishing such guidelines would be crucial to their implementation.\u201d\n\nTranslation: Patients are more likely to accept rationing if it comes with a \u201cmedical seal of approval.\u201d\n\nBut, surprise, at least some insurers are eager to play along. WellPoint already gives oncologists $350-per-month payments for each patient they limit to drugs the company has specified. ASCO has also endorsed bonuses for prescribing \u201ccost-effective\u201d treatments \u2014 which would discourage the use of innovations that are not ASCO-approved but could help patients.\n\nDr. Lowell Schnipper, who heads ASCO\u2019s Value in Cancer Care Task Force, which is building the app, parrots the claim made by Karen Ignagni, president of AHIP (the health-insurance lobby), that new cancer drugs are bankrupting the health system.\n\nThat\u2019s not true. Yes, spending on cancer treatments has climbed from $24 billion in 2004 to about $37 billion today. But that\u2019s less than a half a percent of total US health-care spending.\n\nMore important: While expensive, since 2004 such innovations were largely responsible for a 40 percent increase in living cancer survivors, from 9.8 million to 13.6 million. The new therapies also saved $188 billion on hospitalizations.\n\nIn fact, a new study by Dr. Newcomer himself confirms this result: United Healthcare\u2019s cancer costs dropped as spending on new cancer drugs increased.\n\nFinally, new drugs help people go back to work. The value of the increase in ability to work is 2.5 times what we spend on new therapies.\n\nThe app\u2019s biggest problem, though, is that it\u2019s one-size-fits-all: It treats all patients as the same, ignoring the genetic variation in patient response that a new class of \u201ctargeted\u201d cancer drugs will soon address.\n\nDig a bit deeper, and it\u2019s clear that Schnipper and his allies have a more ideological motivation. He talks of limiting spending on new treatments as a way to make \u201cthe health-care system, not just the cancer system, more rational and just.\u201d\n\nAnd this line of thinking does away with the Hippocratic Oath. No longer is the doctor\u2019s first obligation \u201cto apply for the benefit of the sick, all measures that are required.\u201d Instead, Schnipper believes three months of added life \u201cis not a large enough benefit to trump the greater benefits to many that would have to be foregone to provide it.\u201d\n\nIn fact, he regards the premium that Americans place on life as a character defect, observing, \u201cOther cultures do not seem to view the postponement of death by a few months\u201d the same way we do.\n\nThree months or less of survival can lead to a lifetime free from disease because average survival masks greater gains in many groups. Back in the 1980s, experts predicted AZT, the first anti-AIDS drug, would add less than three months of life. Yet nearly 90 percent of people taking AZT lived for two years. That allowed them to survive long enough to get the next-generation anti-retroviral combination that now keeps HIV in check.\n\nEven when innovations don\u2019t work miracles, refusing to die has a value not measured by the ASCO app.\n\nWhen my friend Lynne Jacoby was diagnosed with advanced pancreatic cancer in April 2012, she was told she\u2019d die in weeks. She accepted the diagnosis, but not the prognosis. She entered a clinical trial and received an innovative treatment tailored to her tumors. She was able to travel, work and spend time with her wife and family.\n\nLynne died last Oct. 6, less than three weeks before her genome was to be sequenced for the next innovation. Her last written words measure the value of innovation Schnipper dismisses and the ASCO app ignores:\n\n\u201cFor someone like me, who is . . . told that my life would be measured in weeks, I guess I would just want everyone to realize that all of our lives are just measured in weeks, and we have to do whatever it takes to make that as many weeks as possible for everyone.\u201d\n\nRobert Goldberg is vice president of the Center for Medicine in the Public Interest and publisher of valueofinnovation.org.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "New York Post", "twitter": {"description": "The latest innovation in cancer care isn\u2019t a medical breakthrough but an app to ration new drugs.
