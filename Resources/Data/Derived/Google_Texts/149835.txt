Dr. Ben Carson, a former Republican presidential candidate and retired neurosurgeon, will deliver Grove City College's commencement address Saturday.

He will fill in for William Bennett, a conservative political theorist who was Education secretary under President Reagan. Bennett had been scheduled to speak, but “had to decline unexpectedly,” college officials said Wednesday.

Commencement will be at 10 a.m. on the campus quad between Harbison Chapel and Crawford Hall. Nearly 600 students will receive degrees from the Mercer County college.

Carson dropped out of the race for the GOP presidential nomination in March after collecting only eight delegates.

Carson is an emeritus professor of neurosurgery, oncology, plastic surgery and pediatrics at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, where he oversaw pediatric neurosurgery at the Johns Hopkins Children's Center for nearly 30 years.

He became more widely known after criticizing Obamacare while standing near President Obama at the 2013 National Prayer Breakfast.

Carson was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian honor, in 2008. He won the Spingarn Medal, the highest honor bestowed by the NAACP, two years earlier.
