Plan management services also entails monitoring agreements with health plans to ensure compliance.\n\nLawmakers Flag Potential Conflicts\n\nIn September 2012, two months before President Obama\u2019s re-election, UnitedHealth Group acquired QSSI through a subsidiary, OptumInsight, in a deal consummated with little fanfare. UnitedHealth Group is also the parent of UnitedHealthcare, which offers plans on the exchanges set up by the Affordable Care Act.\n\nAs The Washington Post noted, neither UnitedHealth nor OptumInsight put out press releases announcing the purchase\u2014and because the deal was relatively small, it didn\u2019t require a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nThe only public evidence of the acquisition appeared on the website for Jenner & Block, the law firm that represented QSSI in the deal.\n\nAfterward, a group of Republican lawmakers sent letters to UnitedHealth and HHS asking for further information on why QSSI got the $84.5 million government contract to work on the federal data hub.\n\nLed by Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah and Rep. Darrell Issa of California, the lawmakers questioned then-HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius about a potential conflict of interest in UnitedHealth\u2019s ownership of OptumInsight and QSSI. Their letter cited the \u201cconsiderable media attention\u201d the deal attracted and pointed to UnitedHealth\u2019s \u201clarge financial stake in the operation of federal exchanges.\u201d\n\nVon Spakovsky, a senior fellow at Heritage\u2019s Meese Center for Legal and Judicial Studies, points to the unfair advantage UnitedHealthcare appears to have over competitors in access to data because of the OptumInsight/QSSI contract with HHS:\n\nThe potential conflict there is that they have a subsidiary that may get access to the information that competitors normally wouldn\u2019t allow out into the marketplace. That\u2019s the inherent conflict in what they\u2019re doing.\n\nHHS Halts Firewall Work\n\nThe Weekly Standard reported that HHS was aware of the conflict presented by its contract with OptumInsight/QSSI and went to work designing a firewall to prevent UnitedHealth from accessing the data obtained by its subsidiary in its work with HealthCare.gov and the federal data hub.\n\nHHS, however, discontinued that work for fear \u201cword could too easily get out about the firewall project,\u201d the magazine reported. \u201cIf it did, it would alert people to UnitedHealth Group\u2019s having gained a potentially huge competitive advantage.\u201d\n\nVon Spakovsky, who worked as a corporate lawyer in the health insurance industry, said the lack of a firewall in the government\u2019s Obamacare system should be a red flag for health insurance providers that compete with UnitedHealthcare. If he were a competing insurance company, he said:\n\nI would want concrete assurances from the government that our information is not going to this competitor and is not going to be used to undercut us in the market. If the government can\u2019t give those assurances, they shouldn\u2019t be allowing the subsidiary to be doing this kind of work and getting access to this information.\n\nAlso of note for Hatch and Issa was the July 2012 departure, for a job at OptumInsight, of Steven Larsen, director of the Center for Consumer Information and Insurance Oversight. The agency is part of HHS\u2019s Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which oversees HealthCare.gov, and crafted the rules for the federal exchange.\n\nIn their letter to Sebelius, the Republican lawmakers said:\n\nThe degree to which Mr. Larsen was involved in the QSSI acquisition is unclear, but the timing of his career change raises several questions about CCIIO [the agency he left].\n\nLarsen\u2019s \u201ccareer change,\u201d Issa and Hatch wrote, could present another conflict of interest.\n\nHHS did not respond to the lawmakers\u2019 questions and refused comment on the suspended work on creating a firewall.\n\nThe Government Hires Some Experts\n\nAlthough implementation of the federal data hub went smoothly, the main Obamacare website, HealthCare.gov, rolled out last October to much-publicized system malfunctions and failures.\n\nAs Obamacare\u2019s near-disastrous implementation was being well documented by multiple congressional hearings and investigations and extensive media reports, the Obama administration sought to hire a private company to fix HealthCare.gov.\n\nOn Oct. 25, HHS announced OptumInsight/QSSI would take over managing the federal insurance exchange.\n\n\u201cQSSI will help monitor, assess, prioritize and manage the technical operations of HealthCare.gov to enhance the consumer experience,\u201d a QSSI spokesman said.\n\nIn January, HHS signed a new contract with OptumInsight/QSSI solidifying the tech company\u2019s role as a \u201csenior advisor.\u201d\n\nIn a statement praising the duo\u2019s partnership, Sebelius said:\n\nOptum/QSSI, which stepped up in October to serve as our general contractor, has been integral in fixing HealthCare.gov. We are pleased Optum/QSSI will remain a key part of our leadership team and will continue to advise us as we work together to help millions of Americans sign up for quality, affordable health insurance.\n\nWith implementation of HealthCare.gov came the rollout of individual state-run online exchanges.\n\nAfter being called in to help with the federal exchange, OptumInsight/QSSI was awarded contracts to work on three state-run exchanges: Maryland, Massachusetts and Minnesota.\n\nUnitedHealthcare is \u201cone of the nation\u2019s largest providers of health plans.\u201d It offers insurance plans on 10 exchanges: Alabama, Colorado, Connecticut, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, Nevada, New York, Rhode Island and the District of Columbia.\n\nBy next year, according to a letter sent last month from Hatch and Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, UnitedHealthcare is looking into expanding from state-run exchanges into the federal exchanges operated by HealthCare.gov.\n\nDuring an earnings call UnitedHealth held with industry analysts last week, executives said they plan to expand to more than 20 state exchanges by 2015, with more to be added to its portfolio in the future.\n\n\u201cBy participating moderately this year and then watching closely and listening, we have learned about pricing, networks, regulatory structure, distribution, and the consumer\u2019s mindset regarding public exchanges,\u201d UnitedHealth CEO Stephen Hemsley said.\n\nThe company reported a 7 percent increase in revenue to $32.6 billion\u2014exceeding Wall Street\u2019s expectations.\n\nSenators Ask Questions\n\nIn their letter sent June 20, Hatch and Grassley sought answers to several questions about UnitedHealthcare and OptumInsight/QSSI from Hemsley and Marilyn Tavenner, administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. The senators wrote:\n\nGiven the role of its fellow subsidiary [of UnitedHealth Group], we have serious questions about any conflicts of interest between the two entities.\n\nThe senators asked Hemsley and Tavenner for:\n\ndocuments related to OptumInsight/QSSI\u2019s contract with HHS,\n\ndocuments from CMS regarding any evaluation of potential conflicts of interest between the two companies,\n\ndocuments regarding any disclosure requirements for conflicts of interest,\n\ndescriptions of any firewalls or infrastructure put in place to protect the integrity of the data available to OptumInsight/QSSI, and\n\na description of the data OptumInsight/QSSI is expected to access in carrying out the scope of its contract.\n\nHatch and Grassley also sought information about the \u201cmovement of individuals in senior leadership positions between Optum/QSSI and UnitedHealthcare.\u201d The senators wrote:\n\nIt is our understanding that several key personnel have recently transitioned from executive level positions at UnitedHealthcare to executive level positions at Optum/QSSI, and vice versa. We would like to ensure that all potential conflicts of interest were mitigated.\n\nLast month, new HHS Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell announced the hiring of Andrew Slavitt, an Optum group executive vice president, as principal deputy administrator of CMS. His post makes Slavitt second-in-command under Tavenner at CMS, which runs Obamacare and HealthCare.gov.\n\nTavenner praised Slavitt, who in 2012 gave the maximum campaign contributions allowed to President Obama\u2019s Victory Fund and Obama for America\u2014now Organizing for Action. In a statement, she said:\n\nAndy\u2019s breadth of experience throughout the health care sector makes him the right person for this role, and I am excited for our partnership across all of the CMS programs.\n\n\u2018Reserving Judgment\u2019\n\nHatch and Grassley imposed a June 30 deadline on UnitedHealth and CMS to respond. So far, neither the insurance company nor the Obamacare agency has answered their questions, Hatch\u2019s staff on the Senate Finance Committee said.\n\nIn a statement to The Daily Signal, Hatch said:\n\nI am reserving judgment about these new CMS positions and appointees, but you don\u2019t solve big government problems by creating more layers of bureaucracy.\n\nCMS spokesman Aaron Albright told The Daily Signal that the agency \u201censured that Optum/QSSI has taken steps to meet standards required by Federal Acquisition Regulations to prevent organizational conflicts of interest.\u201d\n\nThe FAR system governs the process for agencies in acquiring goods and services. Albright did not respond to questions regarding construction of a firewall.\n\nOptumInsight spokeswoman Christine Farazi told The Daily Signal said that the company ensures that customers\u2019 information is protected:", "article_metadata": {"description": "Jarred by the defect-riddled rollout of the Obamacare website, Obama administration officials signed up a technology company to rid HealthCare.gov of bugs.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Jarred by the defect-riddled rollout of the Obamacare website, Obama administration officials signed up a technology company to rid HealthCare.gov of bugs.", "title": "Firm That \u2018Saved\u2019 HealthCare.gov Faces Cronyism Questions", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/140701_UnitedHealth_01.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-07-22T17:28:26+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1p35Jyo"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Jarred by the defect-riddled rollout of the Obamacare website, Obama administration officials signed up a technology company to rid HealthCare.gov of bugs.", "creator": "@dailysignal", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/140701_UnitedHealth_01.jpg"}, "title": "Firm That \u2018Saved\u2019 HealthCare.gov Faces Cronyism Questions", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Health Care", "tag": "cronyism,obamacare", "published_time": "2014-07-22T06:01:03+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-07-22T17:28:26+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "HealthCare.gov; Orrin Hatch; Chuck Grassley; Health and Human Services, Affordable Care Act, Optum/QSSI; UnitedHealth Group; Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services; Andrew Slavitt, Sylvia Burwell"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb84a\"", "article_summary": "Quality Software Systems Inc., or QSSI, is the tech firm the Department of Health and Human Services picked in October 2013 to straighten out HealthCare.gov.\nThe Government Hires Some ExpertsAlthough implementation of the federal data hub went smoothly, the main Obamacare website, HealthCare.gov, rolled out last October to much-publicized system malfunctions and failures.\nOn Oct. 25, HHS announced OptumInsight/QSSI would take over managing the federal insurance exchange.\nMaryland-based QSSI was awarded an $84.5 million contract with HHS\u2019s Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services in January 2012 to build the part of HealthCare.gov known as the federal data hub.\n\u201cQSSI will help monitor, assess, prioritize and manage the technical operations of HealthCare.gov to enhance the consumer experience,\u201d a QSSI spokesman said."}
