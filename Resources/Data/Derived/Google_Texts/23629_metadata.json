Searching for an ACA shout-out\n\nThis time, President Barack Obama is going to have to actually talk about Obamacare in his State of the Union address.\n\nNo more touch-the-base-and-keep-running treatments, the way he\u2019s handled it the past couple of years. This time, he\u2019ll be expected to linger on base a bit, at least long enough to acknowledge the launch of the biggest domestic achievement of his presidency \u2014 and do it in the least awkward way possible.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThat\u2019s the consensus of Democratic strategists, health care experts, pollsters and crisis-management experts, all of whom will have reasons to listen closely when Obama brings up the health care law on Jan. 28. It will be Obama\u2019s most high-profile address since the clunky rollout began, and although it has come a long way since the worst days of October, it\u2019s still not enough for him to say, \u201cNailed it.\u201d\n\n( Also on POLITICO: Obama plans 'optimistic' State of the Union)\n\nInstead, Obama will have to find an uplifting message about the law that doesn\u2019t imply that everything\u2019s suddenly back on track. The most he can say, based on the latest developments, is that \u201cit\u2019s moving back toward the track,\u201d said Len Nichols, director of the Center for Health Policy Research and Ethics at George Mason University.\n\nThe federal enrollment website, HealthCare.gov, is working much better than it was in October, and sign-ups for private health coverage sped up dramatically in December. Now 3 million Americans have selected private health insurance plans, and there\u2019s time for one more wave before enrollment ends March 31. And CGI, the main contractor on the botched website, has been shown the door.\n\n( WATCH: POLITICO\u2019s issue-by-issue SOTU preview)\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean the Obama administration can put its fire extinguishers away though. The age mix isn\u2019t right yet with too many older adults and not enough younger ones. The early sign-ups in the exchanges may not include a lot of actual uninsured people, although some have probably been added through Medicaid. Insurers are still waiting for the \u201cback end\u201d of the website, the part that handles their payments, to be built.\n\nAnd HealthCare.gov\u2019s Facebook page is loaded with complaints about enrollment problems, like customers who say they couldn\u2019t get any proof of coverage from their insurance companies, couldn\u2019t get coverage for their kids or are bouncing back and forth between the website and insurance call centers to try to resolve errors.\n\n( WATCH: Turn the Table: State of the Union predictions)\n\nThe bottom line: Obama needs a speech that rallies the faithful without losing credibility with the rest of the country.\n\nThere\u2019s actually a fairly easy formula, according to the strategists and health care analysts, and it doesn\u2019t require a radical departure from what Obama has already said about the law. He needs to say that millions of people have already signed up for coverage \u2014 though he shouldn\u2019t overstate how many. He should say that millions more who already have health coverage have gotten new benefits, like preventive care with no copayments. He has acknowledged the bad rollout, but tell the law\u2019s most enthusiastic supporters that \u201cwe\u2019ve turned the corner.\u201d\n\n( Also on POLITICO: Backstage SOTU peek on Instagram)\n\nMost of all, Democratic strategists say, he has to revive his message that \u201cwe\u2019re not going back.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think he is going to try and resell that everything is perfect, but I would remind people that we can\u2019t go back to a time when insurance companies were running the health care system and deciding who gets to participate,\u201d said Democratic pollster John Anzalone. \u201cNo more getting denied coverage because of pre-existing conditions, no more being priced out of the marketplace because of DNA (pre-existing conditions), no more lifetime limits, no more having to file bankruptcy because a family has a medical emergency.\u201d\n\nObama has said all of that before, but now that people are actually getting health coverage and other benefits, Democrats say the reminder is more important than ever.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: State of the Union: Response mania)\n\n\u201cAmericans do not like having their rights taken away. And they do not like the idea of the GOP taking away their newfound health care rights,\u201d said Paul Begala, a former adviser to President Bill Clinton.\n\nHealth care didn\u2019t occupy a lot of time in Obama\u2019s last three State of the Union addresses since the law was signed. In 2011, Obama acknowledged that the new House Republican majority hated the law, said it can always be improved but vowed never to go back to the days when insurance companies could turn people down because of pre-existing conditions. In 2012 and 2013, Obamacare was reduced to a walk-on role \u2014 a couple of quick sentences, and that was it.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "Democratic strategists say Obama must revive his message that \u201cwe\u2019re not going back.\u201d", "title": "Searching for an ACA shout-out", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2014/01/barack-obama-state-of-the-union-2014-obamacare-102610.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2014/01/25/140125_barack_obama_ap_605.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Barack Obama,Obamacare,State Of The Union 2014,Democrats", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "Democratic strategists say Obama must revive his message that \u201cwe\u2019re not going back.\u201d", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcae4d\"", "article_summary": "Health care didn\u2019t occupy a lot of time in Obama\u2019s last three State of the Union addresses since the law was signed.\nNow 3 million Americans have selected private health insurance plans, and there\u2019s time for one more wave before enrollment ends March 31.\nSearching for an ACA shout-outThis time, President Barack Obama is going to have to actually talk about Obamacare in his State of the Union address.\nStory Continued BelowThat\u2019s the consensus of Democratic strategists, health care experts, pollsters and crisis-management experts, all of whom will have reasons to listen closely when Obama brings up the health care law on Jan. 28.\nAnd they do not like the idea of the GOP taking away their newfound health care rights,\u201d said Paul Begala, a former adviser to President Bill Clinton."}
