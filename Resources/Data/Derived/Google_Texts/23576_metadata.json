The next morning, nearly doubled over in pain, a patient who we\u2019ll call \u201cNancy\u201d walked gingerly into the emergency room at Martha\u2019s Vineyard Hospital.\n\nNancy is a 55-year-old former nurse who would prefer not to use her real name because she works with the hospitals in this story.\n\nEven Nancy, who spends hours every day focused on health care costs, would gasp when she saw the bill for this visit.\n\nIn the ER, a doctor poked at Nancy\u2019s tender belly and took blood for tests and a urine sample. The doctor ordered a CT scan of Nancy\u2019s abdomen and pelvis, using contrast. It showed bulges, inflammation and thickening in Nancy\u2019s colon. The diagnosis: uncomplicated diverticulitis. Nancy filled a prescription for an antibiotic, took some Advil, and felt better after a few days on a clear liquid diet.\n\nFive weeks later, the diverticulitis monster invaded Nancy\u2019s intestines again. This time she went to an urgent care center closer to home, run by Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC). A doctor there ordered the same single CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis, again with contrast.\n\nNancy says the care she received at both places was great. But a month later, when she received the bills and her insurance company\u2019s explanation of benefits for both visits on the same day, she was stunned.\n\nThe explanation of benefits show Blue Cross had paid Martha\u2019s Vineyard Hospital almost seven times what it paid BIDMC\u2019s urgent care center for the same CT scan \u2014 $3,888.76 vs. $574.97.\n\nTotal CT scan cost at Martha\u2019s Vineyard Hospital: $3,888.76 vs. Total CT scan cost at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center urgent care: $574.97\n\n(Have a look at the explanation of benefits here. We compare the payment for the test, listed as \u201cTechnical Component,\u201d and the payment to the radiologist, listed as \u201cProfessional Component.\u201d)\n\nWhy a nearly seven-fold difference in payment for one test and the payment to read it?\n\nI posed that question to Martha\u2019s Vineyard Hospital (MVH). A spokeswoman said via email that MVH\u2019s procedures and costs are very different from an urgent care center. The spokeswoman noted MVH is open 24/7 and must comply with lots of state and federal regulations that don\u2019t apply to an urgent care center. MVH also said that Nancy had two scans at its facility, vs. one at BIDMC \u2014 that\u2019s even though the Blue Cross summary only shows payment for one CT scan.\n\nMVH also said it\u2019s planning to open a walk-in clinic next year that would have a different, lower cost structure than the MVH emergency department.\n\nThe Blue Cross corporate office agreed with MVH that care in a hospital is more expensive than in an urgent care clinic. And a spokeswoman for Blue Cross said that MVH would be even more expensive because it\u2019s an island hospital.\n\n(A side note: If you\u2019re sick on Martha\u2019s Vineyard but you feel well enough to get on a ferry, a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis, with contrast, goes for $1,398.35 at Falmouth Hospital. That\u2019s the cash rate, which I got from the hospital. My Blue Cross representative said she did not know the Blue Cross negotiated rate.)\n\nMartha\u2019s Vineyard Hospital is part of the Partners HealthCare network, which includes some of the most expensive hospitals in the state. Neither the hospital nor Blue Cross mentioned this as a reason for the nearly seven-fold payment difference.\n\nBIDMC declined a request to comment for this story.\n\nJust for fun, I called the member line at Blue Cross to ask how much this CT scan would cost at BIDMC \u2014 the hospital, not their urgent care clinic. The member rep told me Blue Cross would pay BIDMC $1,276 for a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis with contrast at any facility owned by that network. She said the hospital and urgent care center would receive the same payment for the test. She\u2019s wrong, according to the summary Nancy received from Blue Cross, but this illustrates how tricky it can be to unravel the mysteries of this \u2014 or any \u2014 health care bill.\n\nIf you have more tales from the rabbit hole of health care bills and price, do share. Maybe we can find our way out together.", "article_metadata": {"description": "After receiving almost the exact same care at two different hospitals, this patient was stunned when she received both bills on the same day.", "og": {"site_name": "commonhealth", "description": "After receiving almost the exact same care at two different hospitals, this patient was stunned when she received both bills on the same day.", "title": "A Tale Of 2 Hospital Visits: How The Cost Of Care Can Vary Dramatically Depending On Where You\u2019re Treated", "url": "http://commonhealth.wbur.org/2015/11/cost-of-care-marthas-vineyard-beth-israel", "image": "http://s3.amazonaws.com/media.wbur.org/wordpress/15/files/2015/11/AP_186799156348-620x384.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://commonhealth.wbur.org/2015/11/cost-of-care-marthas-vineyard-beth-israel", "image": "//s3.amazonaws.com/media.wbur.org/wordpress/15/files/2015/11/AP_186799156348-620x384.jpg", "site": "@commonhealth", "card": "summary", "title": "A Tale Of 2 Hospital Visits: How The Cost Of Care Can Vary Dramatically Depending On Where You're Treated"}, "DC.date.issued": "2015-11-18", "date": "Wed, 18 Nov 2015 14:09:17 -0500", "fb": {"admins": 1549080028, "app_id": 134067973330252}, "msvalidate.01": "D02D46BAEDB3F81FC1B1DE2A8CB69551"}, "article_summary": "My Blue Cross representative said she did not know the Blue Cross negotiated rate.)\nThis time she went to an urgent care center closer to home, run by Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC).\nA spokeswoman said via email that MVH\u2019s procedures and costs are very different from an urgent care center.\nThe Blue Cross corporate office agreed with MVH that care in a hospital is more expensive than in an urgent care clinic.\nShe said the hospital and urgent care center would receive the same payment for the test."}
