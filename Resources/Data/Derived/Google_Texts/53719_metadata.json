Ted Cruz (R-TX) said the current Republican leadership has \u201cpassed more Democratic priorities than Harry Reid ever could.\u201d\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nCruz said, \u201cWhy do you think John Boehner is stepping down? He\u2019s stepping down because the American people are furious with Republican leaders that don\u2019t do what they promised. And it\u2019s interesting, I do town halls all over the country and I asked folks, \u2018OK, we have Republican majorities in both houses for ten months now. What on earth are they accomplished?\u2019 Every town hall you do the answer is always \u2018absolutely nothing.\u2019 And usually I respond and say, you know what? It\u2019s worse than, that it could have been better if it were nothing. in fact, what the Republican majorities have done, we came back right after the last election, passed a trillion dollar bill filled with corporate welfare. Then Republican leadership and leadership joined with Harry Reid and the Democrats to do that. Then leadership voted to fund Obamacare. Then they voted to fund amnesty. Then they voted to fund Planned Parenthood then Republican leadership took the lead confirming Loretta Lynch as attorney general.\u201d\n\nHe continued, \u201cWhich one of those decisions is one iota different than what would have happened under Harry Reid and the Democrats? The truth of the matter is Republican leadership are the most effective Democrat leaders we\u2019ve ever seen. They\u2019ve passed more Democratic priorities than Harry Reid ever could.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Cruz: Current GOP Leadership is the \u2018Most Effective Dem Leaders We\u2019ve Ever Seen\u2019", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Cruz: Current GOP Leadership is the \u2018Most Effective Dem Leaders We\u2019ve Ever Seen\u2019", "title": "Cruz: Current GOP Leadership Is the \u2018Most Effective Dem Leaders We\u2019ve Ever Seen\u2019 - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/10/cruz.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/video/2015/10/18/cruz-current-gop-leadership-is-the-most-effective-dem-leaders-weve-ever-seen/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Cruz: Current GOP Leadership is the \u2018Most Effective Dem Leaders We\u2019ve Ever Seen\u2019", "creator": "@pamkeyNEN", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/10/cruz.jpg", "title": "Cruz: Current GOP Leadership Is the \u2018Most Effective Dem Leaders We\u2019ve Ever Seen\u2019 - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "app_id": 1243316582352556, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Cruz: Current GOP Leadership is the \u2018Most Effective Dem Leaders We\u2019ve Ever Seen\u2019", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "2016 Presidential Race", "tag": "Ted Cruz", "published_time": "2015-10-18T08:36:08-07:00", "categories": "Breitbart TV,2016 Presidential Race"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc459\"", "article_summary": "The truth of the matter is Republican leadership are the most effective Democrat leaders we\u2019ve ever seen.\nThen Republican leadership and leadership joined with Harry Reid and the Democrats to do that.\nThen leadership voted to fund Obamacare.\nThey\u2019ve passed more Democratic priorities than Harry Reid ever could.\u201d\nHe\u2019s stepping down because the American people are furious with Republican leaders that don\u2019t do what they promised."}
