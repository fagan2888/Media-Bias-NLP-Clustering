Two motorcyclists have been charged in a wreck that injured them both in Beaufort County Saturday.

Troopers with the NC Highway Patrol say two motorcycles were driving west on Durham Creek Road in Blounts Creek around 5:20 p.m. when they went around a curve too fast.

The motorcycles crossed the center line, went off the road and struck a ditch. One of the motorcycles came to rest against a tree. The other driver was thrown off the bike and landed on the roadway.

One of the drivers was airlifted to Vidant Medical Center, while the other was transported to Vidant Beaufort Hospital. Their conditions aren't known.

Both drivers are charged with driving left of center.
