Blue Cross and Blue Shield of North Carolina has refunded nearly $2 million to more than 4,600 over-billed customers as well as restored coverage for thousands who were dropped from its rolls in the wake of an IT system failure, the Charlotte Observer reports. The North Carolina Department of Insurance as well as the state attorney general are investigating what the article describes as "the most series crisis in Blue Cross' recent history."

The insurer says the problem arose from the transfer of customer data from a legacy software program to a new program called Facets, according to the Observer. It also said that extended Affordable Care Act enrollment deadlines and inaccurate data from customers exacerbated the delays tied to the technology upgrade. Other insurers have also reported delays processing applications due to the surge in ACA enrollment at the end of the year.

BCBSNC says it's "making progress" in solving the issues, but notes it still has a lot of work to do to get its operations back to normal. Article
