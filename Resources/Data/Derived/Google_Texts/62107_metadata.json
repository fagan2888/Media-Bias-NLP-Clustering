John Kasich came to town.\n\n\u201cKasich contributed, I think in a meaningful way, to passing Medicaid expansion in Montana,\u201d Republican State Sen. Scott Sales told Watchdog.org.\n\nDuring a January trip to Helena, Kasich accused Obamacare expansion foes of \u201cturning down your money back to Montana on an ideological basis when people can lose their lives.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about bringing our tax dollars home,\u201d Democrat Montana Gov. Steve Bullock said, borrowing a line from Kasich when an Obamacare expansion bill \u2014 sponsored by Republican State Sen. Ed Buttrey \u2014 was introduced in March.\n\nBullock signed Buttrey\u2019s Obamacare expansion bill last week, after Montana\u2019s House and Senate approved it.\n\nFor two years before Kasich\u2019s visit, Republican majorities in both houses of the Montana State Legislature kept Bullock from implementing Obamacare\u2019s Medicaid expansion.\n\nAn attack on the expansion\u2019s critics from Kasich, a Republican, helped change that.\n\n\u201cHe spoke the perfect Democrat talking points, including trying to shame people into voting for it, using, in my opinion, scripture that\u2019s taken out of context,\u201d Sales told Watchdog.org of Kasich\u2019s January visit.\n\nWhen Sales questioned Kasich\u2019s simultaneous promotion of federally funded Obamacare expansion and a balanced federal budget, Kasich told Montana lawmakers the Bible supports Obamacare.\n\nKasich \u201cgave cover\u201d to Republican supporters of Obamacare expansion and helped Bullock pressure the expansion\u2019s critics, Sales said.\n\n\u201cIt fit the narrative of the Democrats, having someone that has a reputation \u2014 whether it\u2019s deserved or not \u2014 to be a fiscal conservative who comes and advocates for something like that,\u201d Sales explained.\n\nBalanced Budget Forever, a group created by Kasich backers to promote a Convention of States and add a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution, paid for Kasich\u2019s Montana trip.\n\nAfter Kasich\u2019s visit, Sales said, Montanans told him, \u201cI think you\u2019re gonna defeat the Convention of States, but I think Kasich did everything he could to help pass Medicaid expansion in Montana.\u201d\n\nBullock was triumphantly quoting Kasich\u2019s false assertion \u2014 \u201cyour money back to Montana\u201d \u2014 by the time Kasich left the state.\n\n\u201cIt got a lot of play in Montana, inside the Legislature as well as outside,\u201d Sales said. \u201cThe guy that basically carried the bill, a portion of his talking points were straight out of Kasich\u2019s playbook.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will not and I have not supported a pure Medicaid expansion,\u201d Buttrey told Montana Public Radio. Unlike Kasich\u2019s Obamacare expansion in Ohio, Buttrey\u2019s bill includes cost-sharing and job training requirements for enrollees.\n\nA Great Falls Tribune editorial endorsing Buttrey\u2019s Obamacare expansion bill noted Kasich \u201cvisited Montana to urge Republicans to support it here.\u201d\n\nThe Tribune, The Montana Standard and the Missoulian all emphasized Kasich\u2019s support for Obamacare expansion in coverage of his January trip to Montana.\n\nBullock pointed to Kasich\u2019s support at press events promoting Medicaid expansion, and Obamacare expansion coalition Healthy Montana Campaign got mileage out of Kasich\u2019s pro-Obamacare rhetoric.\n\nAn executive from hospital network Benefis Health System wrapped up a January presentation at a Northcentral Montana Healthcare Alliance conference by quoting Kasich\u2019s attack on Obamacare critics.\n\nWashington Post blogger Greg Sargent applauded Kasich\u2019s \u201cpowerful case for Obamacare.\u201d Talking Points Memo contributor Dylan Scott cheered Kasich on for \u201cforcefully arguing for other states to expand Medicaid.\u201d\n\nThe Kasich administration did not respond to a request for comment about the governor promoting Obamacare expansion in Montana.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Obamacare supporters in Montana had fallen short in their efforts to expand Medicaid \u2014 and then Ohio Gov.
