He said, \u201cWe\u2019re not a sponsor or supporter, and we certainly don\u2019t condone it.\u201d McNally added that the movement\u2019s organizers appear to be using information from a 2006 ATA report, which described how \u201ccommercial truck traffic is vital to our nation\u2019s economic prosperity and plays a significant role in mitigating adverse economic effects during a national or regional emergency.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur economy depends on trucks to deliver ten billion tons of virtually every commodity consumed \u2014 or nearly 70 percent of all freight transported annually in the U.S.,\u201d the report continues. \u201cThe unimpeded flow of trucks is critical to the safety and well-being of all Americans.\u201d\n\nBased on that information, while a three-day strike could prove troublesome for the U.S., McNally says he doubts that enough truckers will join the movement, since \u201cthere hasn\u2019t been a nationwide [trucker] strike of any kind for many years.\u201d\n\nThough there was a trucker strike in 2008 against the high price of diesel fuel, participation was scattered across the nation, and as a result the strike didn\u2019t receive much attention. However, in 1973 and 1974, fueled by the OPEC oil embargo, long-haul truckers \u201cprotested skyrocketing fuel costs, blockaded highways and gas stations, and engaged in sporadic violence against drivers who did not respect the boycott,\u201d according to the quarterly progressive journal Democracy.\n\nThe truckers wanted the federal government to intervene and put a price cap on diesel fuel, launch an investigation into profit gouging by oil companies and lift the 55 mile-per-hour speed limit. In response, President Richard Nixon declined to negotiate with the truckers, saying that he wasn\u2019t going to bargain with \u201ca handful of desperadoes.\u201d\n\nIn 1979, the Iranian Revolution \u201cworsened the energy crisis\u201d to a point where 75,000 truckers agreed to go on strike. They said they wanted the federal government to freeze the price of diesel fuels and provide subsidies for independent owner-operators. One of the organizers of the strike, the Independent Truckers Association, which was a new organization at the time, also demanded for the complete deregulation of the industry. In response to this strike, Congress deregulated freight trucking.\n\nIf the October 2013 strike does go on as planned, the ATA report says the halt in trucking goods across the nation could lead to \u201csignificant shortages\u201d everywhere, especially for perishable items. Since the effect a trucker strike could have on the U.S. not only has the potential to be inconvenient for the daily lives of Americans, it also has the potential to wreak havoc on the U.S. economy.\n\nIn the report, the ATA reported that there are seven key consumer industries that are largely dependent on truckers hauling goods: the food industry, health care, transportation, waste removal, retail, manufacturing, and banking and finance.\n\nIn a situation where all commercial trucks stopped running, in the first 24 hours alone, the ATA said delivery of medical supplies to affected areas would cease, causing hospitals to run out of supplies such as syringes and catheters. Radiopharmaceuticals would also deteriorate and become unusable. Gas stations would run out of fuel, manufacturers would likely develop component shortages and U.S. mail and other package delivery services would cease.\n\nWhile it\u2019s not known yet how many truckers would actually participate in the protest, the organizers said, \u201cIt does not matter if a million or 50 roll through D.C. in this effort.\u201d Consumers will likely have to wait until October 11 to see how large of an impact this strike will have on the U.S.\n\nIf the strike is as large as organizers hope, Congress and President Obama will have no choice but to listen to the protesters, since the American people would likely be protesting themselves after they would be directly impacted by a lack of goods.\n\nWhy strike?\n\nOrganized on social media sites, various news organizations reported that the \u201cTruckers To Shut Down America\u201d Facebook page was created on Sept. 15 and has more than 53,000 likes.\n\nHowever, when Mint Press News tried to access the page on Sept. 23, 2013, it appeared to no longer exist. In a Facebook search for the group, Mint Press News found a similar page that appeared to be created on Sept. 20. This group had 42 members and had a goal of obtaining 10,000 likes.\n\nIn support of the strike, Kevin Allan posted a YouTube video, saying that it\u2019s time to stand up to \u201cD.C. bullshit.\u201d He said truckers were organizing to shut down Washington, D.C. for about one and a half months, saying, \u201cD.C. brace up cause [sic] we\u2019re coming,\u201d and added that \u201cwe told you we were coming and so you should have expected us.\u201d\n\nThough the organizers have been slightly vague in their reasoning for the strike \u2014 other than that they are trying to call out unnamed abuses against the Constitution \u2014 recent news reports said the organizers added some of their goals to the Facebook page in order to explain the motives behind the action.\n\nIncluded in their \u201clist of demands\u201d is to remove President Obama from office \u201cfor crimes of treason and misdemeanors,\u201d for Congress to hold a Congressional hearing on the Sept. 11, 2012 attack on the U.S. Embassy in Benghazi, Libya, as well as the SEAL Team 6 incident in August 2011, which saw a Chinook helicopter shot down by Taliban forces in Afghanistan.\n\nOther issues the group wants to have the government address include putting former director of the IRS exempt organizations division Lois Lerner in jail, removing U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder from office for \u201ccrimes against the people and the Constitution,\u201d removing all Muslims from government positions if they are found to not uphold the Constitution and high fuel prices.\n\nWhen it comes to the group\u2019s targeting of Muslims, the organizers have allegedly taken up an issue with what they say is President Obama\u2019s attempts to spread Islam in the U.S. In actuality, Obama is a Christian.\n\nStill, the group has justified the strike by saying, \u201cThe American people are sick and tired of the corruption that is destroying America! We therefore declare a GENERAL STRIKE on the weekend of October 11-13, 2013! Truck drivers will not haul freight! American can strike in solidarity with truck drivers!\u201d\n\nAccording to news reports, the \u201cTruckers To Shutdown America\u201d Facebook page said that when the strike takes place, \u201cObamacare will be in effect and most people will be ready to take action. No commerce on those days stock up on items that you will need. No banking no shopping no money transactions.\u201d\n\nWhether or not the strike will occur or be successful remains to be seen.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Some truckers are organizing what they call a \u201cRide for the Constitution\u201d through the nation\u2019s capital. , American Trucking Association, Constitution, Ride for the Constitution, strike, truckers,", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "AUTHOR": "Katie Rucke", "og": {"site_name": "MintPress News", "description": "Some truckers are organizing what they call a \u201cRide for the Constitution\u201d through the nation\u2019s capital. , American Trucking Association, Constitution, Ride for the Constitution, strike, truckers,", "title": "Group Of Truckers Propose Strike To \u2018Shut Down America\u2019", "url": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/group-of-truckers-propose-strike-to-shut-down-america/169523/", "image": "http://mnpprodpublic.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/092313_truckers_16x9.jpg", "updated_time": "2013-09-24T10:29:32-05:00", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Some truckers are organizing what they call a \u201cRide for the Constitution\u201d through the nation\u2019s capital. , American Trucking Association, Constitution, Ride for the Constitution, strike, truckers,", "title": "Group Of Truckers Propose Strike To \u2018Shut Down America\u2019", "image": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/092313_truckers_4x3.jpg", "creator": "@katierucke", "site": "@MintPressNews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"admins": 100003161352196}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/MintpressNewsMPN", "section": "Daily Digest", "tag": "truckers", "published_time": "2013-09-24T05:00:07-05:00", "modified_time": "2013-09-24T10:29:32-05:00"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd63f\"", "article_summary": "Group Of Truckers Propose Strike To \u2018Shut Down America\u2019Some truckers are organizing what they call a \u201cRide for the Constitution\u201d through the nation\u2019s capital.\nbullshit.\u201d He said truckers were organizing to shut down Washington, D.C. for about one and a half months, saying, \u201cD.C.\nStill, the group has justified the strike by saying, \u201cThe American people are sick and tired of the corruption that is destroying America!\nIn support of the strike, Kevin Allan posted a YouTube video, saying that it\u2019s time to stand up to \u201cD.C.\nofficial MintPress sponsor official MintPress sponsorThough the strike is supported by some truckers, the upcoming three-day protest is not supported by the American Trucking Associations, which is the largest trade organization for truckers."}
