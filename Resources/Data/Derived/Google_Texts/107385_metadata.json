Bush's administration. \"It may not be great for America, but that's the reality.\"\n\nScully says Republicans may be able to make substantial changes but not repeal Obama's law entirely.\n\nWhat would a different health care conversation sound like? Some possibilities:\n\nPrescription Drug Prices\n\nNearly three-quarters of the general public see prescription drug costs as unreasonable, according to a recent Kaiser Family Foundation survey. That concern seems to be driven by new breakthrough drugs that can cost $100,000 a year and even more. Last year it was Sovaldi, a cure for liver-wasting hepatitis C infection. Next it could be skin cancer drugs in the approval pipeline.\n\nEconomist Len Nichols of George Mason University in Virginia says the cost of new medications is \"unsustainable,\" but government price controls could stifle innovation.\n\nMost patients are not exposed to those excruciating cost pressures because the vast majority of prescriptions are for lower-priced generic drugs. Overall, only 1 in 5 people taking prescription drugs say it is difficult to afford their own medications, the same survey found.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nHigh Insurance Costs\n\nThe value of a health insurance card is being eroded as employers and insurers impose higher deductibles, copayments and other cost-sharing on top of premiums.\n\n\"When people ask me what is the No. 1 change I want to make in the Affordable Care Act, my answer is that it's not affordable enough,\" said John McDonough, a former Democratic Senate aide who helped steer the health law to passage. \"Moving forward, one of the challenges is how we're going to address this new world of cost sharing.\"", "article_metadata": {"description": "Washington \u2022 The country finally has an opportunity to change the subject on health care, after the Supreme Court again upheld President Barack Obama\u2019s law.
