Cantor Fitzgerald\u2019s Joseph D. France maintained a Hold rating on the company with a price target of $135, while Leerink\u2019s Ana Gupta maintained an Outperform rating on the company, with a price target of $150. UnitedHealth\u2019s potential exposure from ACA exchanges and the de-risking of HIX losses are positive, the analysts believe.\n\nReevaluating ACA In View Of Higher Losses\n\nUnitedHealth Group is witnessing higher losses on ACA exchanges and evaluating its participation in the same. Analyst Joseph France believes that the company\u2019s potential exit from the market in 2017 would eliminate a program whose losses could worsen because of adverse selection and uneven enforcement of controls on enrolment.\n\nFrance believes that UnitedHealth\u2019s experience and its decision to review its commitment to the exchanges could hasten the ACA\u2019s decline. The company\u2019s revised outlook for 2015 reflects that its exchange related losses will be higher than was previously expected.\n\n\u201cEliminating ACA-related losses is a positive, particularly since Medicare and Medicaid are growing faster and the benefit to HCA and ACHC has been limited,\u201d the Cantor Fitzgerald report mentioned, while adding that the current hospital environment requires outreach, greater risk-taking and collaboration with other providers.\n\nDe-Risking From HIX Downside\n\nUnitedHealth has reduced its 2015 EPS outlook, citing pressure in its individual public exchanges. The company also guided to 2016 EPS of $7.10\u2013$7.30. Analyst Ana Gupta believes that this indicates meaningful HIX losses, which should make the company stop marketing actively for 2016 and make a potential exit in 2017.\n\nUnitedHealth has de-risked 2016 with two-thirds of the 2015 guidance reduction relating to 2016, Gupta mentioned. She added, \u201c[We] now expect upside from concessions from CMS on Risk Corridors also disclosed yesterday. UNH has said that they will exit the market should they not see improvement before 2017 as they cannot continue to subsidize this market.\u201d\n\nThe analyst expects UnitedHealth to have strong negotiating power since over 50 percent of the current HIX market is being serviced by publicly traded insurers.\n\nGupta pointed out that other players like Aetna Inc (NYSE: AET) and Anthem Inc (NYSE: ANTM) have largely de-risked 2016 by exiting underperforming HIX markets and focusing their exposure to more stable state-run exchanges. The EPS estimate for FY2015 has been reduced from $6.35 to $6.00.\n\nImage Credit: Public Domain\n\nLatest Ratings for UNH Date Firm Action From To Apr 2016 Cleveland Initiates Coverage on Buy Mar 2016 Mizuho Securities Maintains Buy Mar 2016 Credit Suisse Maintains Outperform View More Analyst Ratings for UNH\n\nView the Latest Analyst Ratings\n\nPosted-In: Analyst Color Long Ideas Health Care Reiteration Top Stories Analyst Ratings Trading Ideas General Best of Benzinga\n\n\u00a9 2016 Benzinga.com.
