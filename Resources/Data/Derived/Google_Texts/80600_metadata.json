The problem is my cholesterol is almost 400, and I'm scared I\u2019ll have a heart attack before I\u2019m 45, like my dad did. What do you suggest I do? \u2014 Frank S., Pittsburgh\n\nA: Start by getting the genetic test for familial high cholesterol, also called familial hypercholesterolemia (FH); it affects about 1 in 500 folks. It happens because a genetic mutation makes your body unable to clear lousy LDL cholesterol from your bloodstream.\n\nIn adults it\u2019s diagnosed when there\u2019s a family history of premature heart disease and lousy LDL cholesterol is 190mg/dL or higher (in kids it\u2019s 160 and up). Genetic testing is recommended to confirm a diagnosis of FH if there\u2019s some doubt about the cause of elevated LDL. Without effective treatment, guys with FH have a 50 percent chance of having a heart attack before age 50; gals with FH have a 30 percent chance.\n\nStatins normally would be your first line of defense, and for many people they\u2019re life-savers, but for you, their side effects are a deal breaker. There are other cholesterol- lowering medications, such as niacin and ezetimibe (used singly they lower LDL 19 percent to 32 percent) that you might tolerate, but neither seems to substantially decrease heart attack risk.\n\nIf you do have FH, there\u2019s a treatment called apheresis, in which blood plasma, removed from your body, is passed through filters to remove extra LDL-cholesterol, and then returned to your body; this is a very difficult treatment regimen.\n\nBut here\u2019s better news: Researchers have discovered a once-a-month injection of a monoclonal antibody called evolocumab helps your body get rid of LDL cholesterol. LDL levels fall by about 60 percent \u2014 without taking a statin or another anticholesterol medication. (For folks with very high LDL that is NOT familial, this antibody reduces levels by up to 75 percent.) Although it won\u2019t hit the market for a few years, you might log onto www.clinicaltrials. gov to see if there are trials for this drug in which you want to enroll. For now, work with your doc on a new treatment plan that improves your meds, nutrition, increases physical activity safely and reduces stress.\n\nQ: I read your article in April about how e-cigarettes don\u2019t really help you kick the cigarette habit and may be risky, but you didn\u2019t mention anything about secondhand vapors. Is there any danger there? \u2014 George G., Pullman, Washington\n\nA: It\u2019s starting to look like there are potentially dangerous emissions from e-cigarettes. They pollute the air less than conventional cigarettes, but one big problem is that most (not all) e-cigarettes are made in China, and that raises quality control concerns.\n\nFor example, the Food and Drug Administration tested several cartridges and found that lead, nickel and copper \u2014 which are listed on the FDA\u2019s \u201charmful and potentially harmful chemicals\u201d list \u2014 were released into the air when e-cigs were used. And when the World Health Organization tested secondhand emissions, they found low levels of formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, isoprene, acetic acid, 2-butanodione, acetone, propanol, propylene glycol and nicotine.\n\nWe agree with the American Heart Association that an evidence-based regulatory scheme should be in place and e-cigarettes should be prohibited wherever tobacco is banned. The products also should have marketing restrictions identical to tobacco restrictions.\n\nSo far, Minnesota taxes e-cigarettes as a tobacco product, and 27 states restrict sales to minors. More than 100 municipalities prohibit the use of e-cigarettes in smoke-free indoor environments. Worldwide, Brazil, Singapore, Canada, the Seychelles and Uruguay have prohibited the sale of e-cigarettes.\n\nIf anyone you know thinks that it\u2019s safe to drag on an e-cigarette around infants or children, ask them not to do that. And as for adults who want to quit smoking, use patches and support groups to get you off nicotine, and then stay inhale-exhale-free for your sake and the sake of those around you.\n\nDr. Mehmet Oz is host of \u201cThe Dr. Oz Show,\u201d and Dr. Mike Roizen is chief medical officer at the Cleveland Clinic Wellness Institute.
