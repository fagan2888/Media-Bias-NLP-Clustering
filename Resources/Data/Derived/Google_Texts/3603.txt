How extraordinary to think that a great many politicians of a certain bent believe educated, informed citizens with a knowledge of history and very good memories are taken in by untruths and unheard, and uncalled for hatred for the president.

We are on to their agenda, from the first night of Obama's inauguration! “Do not let him do anything!” It's their credo. And personal attacks! Just immoral and hate-filled. Enough already. But then, pockets are being lined by their patrons(corporate commerce). We remember the uncalled for invasion of Iraq and the trillions of dollars it cost — the ruination of our budget; and the millions of young men and women sacrificed; and for what? The Middle East still hates us, and war and pestilence prevails. The last administration has a lot to atone for.

Now, on the other hand — our president is a Harvard law graduate, a constitutional scholar who has worked(against all odds) for the people of this country. Why is it so wrong to let the people have affordable insurance? Every civilized country has done this for a long time. What is wrong about trying to use diplomacy; instead of lying about a weak president one day, and the next calling him a king or an emperor?

Advertisement It is perfectly clear what is going on. They want ‘fracking' and a poisonous pipeline that will further destroy our health and environment; versus fixing our ailing infrastructure for the future and offering many more jobs.It's insanity to block all that is good for this country because we have a Congress which is the worst we've ever had. We know who they are; beholden to nonbelievers in what's moral; who, the only constitutional amendment they care about is the 2nd, because the NRA tells them so.

I wonder if these ads don't begin blaming Obama for Ebola? Never has a man been so maligned. Not by the majority of Americans — but, by a Congress who should not be paid for doing nothing! Enough already.
