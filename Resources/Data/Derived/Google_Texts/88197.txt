When Donald Trump went to Texas, he addressed a packed auditorium of approximately 20,000 people for more than 90 minutes, and had the crowd roaring in approval.

"He's telling me everything I want to hear. I'm for change. I'm fed up with the 30 years of empty suits in Washington," said Brian Markum, an energy consultant who was at the rally with his wife, according to NPR.

"We've got a president who doesn't know what the hell he's doing!" said Trump while mocking President Barack Obama for saying that "no challenge poses a greater threat to future generations than climate change" during his State of the Union Address, reported the Daily Mail.

Trump then spoke about what is seen as his favorite agenda, illegal immigration in Texas, blasting the "sanctuary cities" that provide immigrants security, saving them from deportation. "Many of these gang members are illegal immigrants. They're rough dudes," he said while adding that they would not remain in the country long if he were to be elected, reported the New York Times.

Trump promised to improve America's standing in the world and to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. When a supporter suggested the name Donaldcare, he replied, "Thank you! We'll call it Donaldcare," reported the New York Times.

"You're going to say to your children and you're going to say to anybody else that we were part of a movement to take back our country. And we will make America great again," said Trump before signing off from what was the longest speech of any major party candidate in the 2016 presidential election.
