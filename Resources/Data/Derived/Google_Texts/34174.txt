Physical therapy firm: Growth under ACA not a stretch

Jonathan Cohee, president and COO of TheraMatrix Inc., a Pontiac-based provider of outpatient physical therapy, believes the Affordable Care Act will ultimately contribute to revenue growth over the next two years as injured workers and Medicaid patients seek lower-cost and higher-quality providers.



But the trend the past several years of employers and insurers requiring higher copayments and deductibles has led to patients thinking twice about following doctors' orders for the standard 12 therapy sessions, Cohee said.



"Over time, that will drive down utilization for physical therapy," Cohee said. "Doctors prescribe three times a week for four weeks. That is $90 per week for therapy sessions.



"We expect some decrease in utilization because people can't afford it."



Despite a dip in the average number of therapy visits per patient, TheraMatrix has continued to grow, from $18 million in gross billings in 2010 to $24 million in 2012 and $39 million in 2013, Cohee said.



TheraMatrix is a federally certified rehabilitation agency that provides on-site industrial rehabilitation services, hospital-based programs, free-standing outpatient clinics and an outpatient physical therapy managed-care network carve-out program. Typical injuries treated include orthopedic, neck, shoulder and back pain, arthritis and stroke.
