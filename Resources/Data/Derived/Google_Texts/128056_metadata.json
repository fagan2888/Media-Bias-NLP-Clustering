Researchers then categorized each hospital according to the frequency with which time ran out for nurses to complete necessary care tasks.\n\nThey determined older black patients were more likely to be hospitalized at organizations with higher rates of missed care. Of several subcategories of missed care, not receiving medications in a timely manner was the one most strongly associated with readmissions, with odds of patients returning to the hospital increasing 26 percent for affected black patients.\n\nHowever, researchers also found minimal association between readmissions and other forms of unmet care, such as level of patient education and discharge planning, and that unmet care had little effect on older white patients' readmission rates.\n\n\"Our findings suggest that older Black AMI patients endure greater consequences when nursing tasks are left incomplete,\" researchers wrote in the study. \"Any efforts to reduce readmission disparities must include investments to ensure that nurses who work on the frontlines of care can attend to the complex social and healthcare needs of this population.\"\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- read the study\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nCMS launches multi-pronged attack on care disparities\n\nRacially diverse hospitals have lower outcomes disparities\n\nCMS releases tool to map disparities in health of Medicare patients\n\nDiversity in healthcare leadership drives better patient outcomes and community connection\n\nHospitals can bridge cultural differences through population health\n\nHealthcare stereotyping can negatively affect patient outcomes\n\nHealthcare leadership diversity improving, but there's a long way to go\n\nHow increased diversity will change the business of healthcare\n\nHealthcare quality improvement programs don't eliminate racial disparities", "article_metadata": {"description": "As the\u00a0heathcare industry works to address racial disparities\u00a0and identify its causes, a new\u00a0study\u00a0published in\u00a0Medical Care\u00a0indicates missed nursing care may have something to do with it.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "As the\u00a0heathcare industry works to address racial disparities\u00a0and identify its causes, a new\u00a0study\u00a0published in\u00a0Medical Care\u00a0indicates missed nursing care may have something to do with it.", "title": "Missed nursing care may heighten racial disparities", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/missed-nursing-care-may-heighten-racial-disparities/2016-04-22", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "30-day readmissions,Acute Myocardial Infarction,Care Delivery,Nursing Care,Operations & Business Management,Patient Care & Outcomes,Racial Disparities", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Care Delivery,Operations & Business Management,Patient Care & Outcomes"}, "article_summary": "As the heathcare industry works to address racial disparities and identify its causes, a new study published in Medical Care indicates missed nursing care may have something to do with it.\nThey determined older black patients were more likely to be hospitalized at organizations with higher rates of missed care.\n\"Our findings suggest that older Black AMI patients endure greater consequences when nursing tasks are left incomplete,\" researchers wrote in the study.\nOf several subcategories of missed care, not receiving medications in a timely manner was the one most strongly associated with readmissions, with odds of patients returning to the hospital increasing 26 percent for affected black patients.\nResearchers then categorized each hospital according to the frequency with which time ran out for nurses to complete necessary care tasks."}
