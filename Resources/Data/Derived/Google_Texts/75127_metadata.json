Take the ball away from the other team, and the chances of victory rise. Give the ball up too many times, and the odds of a win fall drastically.\n\nWith seven turnovers, Cannon Falls gave away its chance to upset Byron Friday night in a Southern Football Alliance Red division contest. The Bombers were able to keep it close despite losing the turnover battle, 7 to 1, falling 27-15 to the Bears.\n\n\u201cByron is a very good 4A team, and we know that. But we feel we\u2019re a better team than that, and you can\u2019t win a football game when you turn the ball over seven times. You just aren\u2019t going to win,\u201d said Cannon Falls head coach Josh Hofstedt. \u201cAnd when you\u2019re within two (touchdowns) of a good football team, that\u2019s on us, we didn\u2019t perform. (The) coaches, we\u2019ve got to get better next week, the players have got to get better next week, and that\u2019s what we do now: pick it up and move on.\u201d\n\nQuarterback Hunter Johnson, who thrashed Kenyon-Wanamingo last week, threw five interceptions against Byron, and also fumbled twice, though one was a backwards pass that was mishandled in the flat.\n\nThe senior signal-caller didn\u2019t shy away from his poor evening, crediting the Bears and their coaches for having the team prepared for an offense that put up 40 points and 165 yards on 14 of 17 passing last week.\n\n\u201cThey have a lot of very talented cornerbacks, and they ran a good scheme against our kind of offense, so they prepared very well. We just have to do better next game,\u201d Johnson said.\n\nJohnson finished 11 of 27 for 149 yards and a touchdown pass to Bailey Mills, as well as 85 yards on three throws to Alex Bultena. Bultena also completed a pass, a two-point conversion to Mills. Johnson also led the Bombers with 120 rushing yards on 22 carries, one of which was a 35-yard jaunt that pulled Cannon Falls within 12 points. No other Cannon Falls player had more than two rushes or 10 yards.\n\n\u201cIt was a QB draw, and just a big seam and good blocking. I barely got touched,\u201d Johnson said.\n\nBut it was the turnovers and the field position that Byron was able to generate from them that set the tone early.\n\nAfter Johnson\u2019s first interception, the Bears drove 16 yards in four plays to open the scoring with 4 minutes, 31 seconds left in the first quarter. Eleven minutes later, another interception ended in a 20-yard Dan Fujan run that capped a brief, two-play, 39-yard drive.\n\n\u201cIn the first half, especially, offensively, we didn\u2019t help (the defense) at all,\u201d Hofstedt said. \u201cThat\u2019s the hard part; you can\u2019t blame offense or defense because it\u2019s the same 11 guys for us running out there. We\u2019re a smaller school and that\u2019s what we have.\u201d\n\nJohnson settled down a bit on the ensuing Cannon Falls drive, finding Mills on a cross-body throw that zipped through the defense.\n\nByron would use the halftime break to refocus on its own passing attack, as Jonny Mracek threw scoring tosses of 48 and 66 yards before the five-minute mark of the third quarter. Johnson\u2019s scoring run with 8:19 to go pulled the Bombers within two touchdowns, but fumbles and interceptions killed the final four drives of the evening.\n\n\u201cMostly, we\u2019ve got a lot of work to do. We didn\u2019t do some things that we thought we were good at. We\u2019ve got to get better next week,\u201d Hofstedt said.\n\nThe Bombers (1-1 overall, 0-1 SFA Red) head to La Crescent (1-1, 0-1) next week. The Lancers lost 22-15 to Kasson-Mantorville Friday.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "sports,high school,football,cannon falls bombers", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Kyle Stevens", "og": {"site_name": "Republican Eagle", "description": "CANNON FALLS \u2013 Turnovers are often an indicator of how a football game will turn out.
