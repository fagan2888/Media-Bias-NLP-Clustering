As NPR's Ron Elving put it, \"Both Sanders and Clinton showed flashes of animosity bordering on contempt.\"\n\nModerator Wolf Blitzer of CNN tried several times to calm things down, saying, \"Secretary, Senator, please,\" over and over. Finally, he exclaimed, almost shouting himself, \"If you're both screaming at each other, the viewers won't be able to hear either of you. So please don't talk over each other.\"\n\nIt was the latest example of something we've seen over and over during this presidential campaign: candidates yelling \u2014 at themselves, their competition, moderators and even the audience \u2014 with the message getting lost in the process.\n\nOn Twitter, there were complaints about the noise. Some joked about the candidates' ages.\n\nAnd others seemed to touch on gender, and the way it might affect how different candidates are heard.\n\nFor months, the Democratic side of the presidential debate had been considered to conduct quieter, more restrained presidential debates. But the tables seemed to have turned this week. Democrats were at their fieriest yet, and the Republican contenders are coming off a week of family filled town halls and a recent debate that seemed to focus a lot on policy instead of hand size and insulting nicknames.\n\nIn the run-up to Tuesday's New York primary, Clinton and Sanders have been engaged in multiple battles \u2014 over who's more New York, who's more qualified, and who can make the most change.\n\nWe may have to add another battle to this list \u2014 which of these two is the loudest.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"category": "none", "description": "During an exchange over how high to raise the minimum wage in Thursday night&#039;s Democratic debate, Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders began to shout", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://wnpr.org/post/memeoftheweek-shouting-politicans", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/wnpr/files/201502/wnpr-default-image.png", "type": "article", "description": "During an exchange over how high to raise the minimum wage in Thursday night&#039;s Democratic debate, Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders began to shout", "title": "#MemeOfTheWeek: Shouting Politicans"}, "story_id": 474398183, "twitter": {"site": "@wnpr", "card": "summary", "creator": "@wnpr"}, "author": "Sam Sanders", "org_id": 1, "dc": {"title": "#MemeOfTheWeek: Shouting Politicans"}, "nid": 57276, "datePublished": "2016-04-16", "wordCount": 364, "has_audio": 0, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "For months, the Democratic side of the presidential debate had been considered to conduct quieter, more restrained presidential debates.\nFinally, he exclaimed, almost shouting himself, \"If you're both screaming at each other, the viewers won't be able to hear either of you.\nAs NPR's Ron Elving put it, \"Both Sanders and Clinton showed flashes of animosity bordering on contempt.\"\nIn the run-up to Tuesday's New York primary, Clinton and Sanders have been engaged in multiple battles \u2014 over who's more New York, who's more qualified, and who can make the most change.\nModerator Wolf Blitzer of CNN tried several times to calm things down, saying, \"Secretary, Senator, please,\" over and over."}
