Last year alone, Americans spent a whopping $78 billion buying lottery tickets.\n\nThat\u2019s a whole lot of money thrown around in the hopes of raking it in.\n\nBut would boatloads of cash really make you much happier? Studies of lottery winners suggest that\u2019s hardly a sure bet.\n\nRELATED: 81-YEAR-OLD \u2018GAMBLER\u2019 WINS $336M IN POWERBALL\n\nOther studies of money and happiness find that greater wealth does not always bring greater joy. A 2010 study from Princeton University found that emotional well-being does improve as your income increases \u2013 but it also levels off after $75,000.

You\u2019ll soon have more opportunity to find out. Starting next month, Mega Millions will boost its starting jackpot level and allow the total booty to increase more quickly when no top winner is selected.\n\nYour odds of actually winning the top jackpot are 1 in 175 million. You\u2019re literally 600 times more likely to be struck by lightning.\n\nBut, hey, you never know.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "News that one lucky lotto player (or group) in South Carolina", "title": "Don't Be Too Jealous of That Powerball Winner", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2013/09/19/Powerball-Dont-Be-Too-Jealous-Lucky-Winner", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/11032011_Powerball_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2013/09/19/Powerball-Dont-Be-Too-Jealous-Lucky-Winner", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/11032011_Powerball_article.jpg", "creator": "@bethbrav", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "News that one lucky lotto player (or group) in South Carolina", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda829\"", "article_summary": "Maybe that\u2019s why nearly 40 percent of adults say they\u2019ve purchased a lottery ticket in the past 30 days.\nStarting next month, Mega Millions will boost its starting jackpot level and allow the total booty to increase more quickly when no top winner is selected.\nNews that one lucky lotto player (or group) in South Carolina will take home the entire $400 million Powerball Jackpot is enough to make anyone green with envy.\n(If yesterday\u2019s lotto winner opted for 30 annual payments, he or she would net more than $13 million per year.)\nRELATED: 81-YEAR-OLD \u2018GAMBLER\u2019 WINS $336M IN POWERBALLOther studies of money and happiness find that greater wealth does not always bring greater joy."}
