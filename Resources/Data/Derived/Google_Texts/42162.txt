Four people in New Hampshire have been linked to a multi-state outbreak of salmonella, state health officials said.

Sixty-three people have been infected with salmonella in 10 states. Each case is linked to bean sprouts from Wonton Foods in Brooklyn, New York, according to the New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services.

The last shipment of bean sprouts went out Tuesday. As of Friday, the company agreed to voluntarily stop the production and sale of its bean sprouts and take steps to prevent salmonella.

Illnesses linked to the bean sprouts were reported between Sept. 30 and Nov. 8 in Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, Montana, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and Vermont. Eleven people have been hospitalized, but none in New Hampshire, officials said.

“The Division of Public Health Services will continue to investigate to identify any other potential cases and has notified the New Hampshire Grocers Association and the New Hampshire Restaurant and Lodging Association so that the product is removed from consumption,” said Dr. Jose Montero, New Hampshire’s director of public health. “Sprouts are a known source of food-borne illness, so if you are not sure of the origin of any sprouts, it is best to throw them out rather than risk consuming a contaminated product.”

Salmonella causes diarrhea, fever and abdominal cramps usually 12 to 72 hours after infection. The illness usually lasts four to seven days, and most people recover without treatment.
