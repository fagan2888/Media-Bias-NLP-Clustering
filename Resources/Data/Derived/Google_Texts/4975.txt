Seattle Seahawks fans set a world record during yesterday’s matchup against the San Francisco 49ers, making CenturyLink Field the “world’s loudest stadium” in the sports history. The previous record was set by fans at Ali Sami Yen Sport Complex Turk Telekom Arena in Istanbul, Turkey during a soccer match in 2011.

At the 1:15 mark in the first quarter, Seahawk’s defensive end Michael Bennett sacked 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick, bringing the entire Seattle fans to their feet. Guinness World Records representative Phillip Robertson recorded the noise level at 131.9 decibels, .2 decibels higher than the previous record set in Istanbul.

Seahawks fans, affectionately known as the 12th man, weren’t done after initially breaking the record. After running back Marshawn Lynch’s second touchdown of the day in the fourth quarter, the crowd shattered both of the previously held records with 136.6 decibels, Seattlepi.com reported. This record-breaking effort was organized by former Seahawks lineman Joe Tafoya and his group Volume 12.

According to Alison Grimes, assistant clinical professor of head/neck surgery at UCLA's David Geffen School of Medicine, people at sporting events don’t understand the damage they are inflicting on their hearing. “Noise in cumulative over the lifetime,” Grimes told NBC News. “If you’re literally talking about 130 decibels – nobody should ever be exposed to that. There isn’t a safe amount of time for 130 decibels. It’s physically painful as well as acoustically damaging.”
