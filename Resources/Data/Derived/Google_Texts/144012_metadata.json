I wanted Fitz to have that. Obama\u2019s the same way.\u201d\n\nGoldwyn also said that the goal of Fitz\u2019s presidency is to \u201cdrag\u201d the Republicans back to the center.\n\n\u201cFitz\u2019s presidency is about bringing the Republican Party back to something that makes some sense,\u201d alleged Goldwyn. \u201cKind of what Clinton did in the opposite way with the Democratic Party. To drag the Republican Party, perhaps kicking and screaming, back to the center, although his vice president is very much of the Michele Bachmann wing.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think he views himself as a pragmatic president in the way Clinton was,\u201d he continued of Fitz. \u201cI think he would want his own version of Obamacare. There\u2019s been much mention of immigration reform in \u2018Scandal,\u2019 and he has this Dream Act that he\u2019s pushing.\u201d\n\nGoldwyn described himself as a \u201cmoderate Democrat\u201d and insisted that he would never consider running for office because he likely isn\u2019t \u201csmart enough.\u201d\n\nThe actor also recalled his first White House Correspondents Dinner last year at which he met \u201cScandal\u201d fans like the first lady herself.\n\n\u201cAll that these incredibly prominent, sophisticated, impressive people wanted to talk about was \u2018Scandal,'\u201d Goldwyn said of the event. \u201cI was pretty startled and kind of embarrassed. There\u2019s so many politicians! And this year there were 10 times that, from Nancy Pelosi to Mrs. Obama to the president himself \u2014 although I expect he doesn\u2019t actually watch it. He\u2019s a little busy. I suspect he was briefed.\u201d\n\nConsidering the amount of time Obama dedicates to the sport of golf, he likely makes a bit of downtime to watch \u201cScandal\u201d too.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "NGFB Pro 7.8.4U", "og": {"site_name": "Red Alert Politics", "description": "In advance of the season four premier of ABC's \"Scandal\" Thursday night, actor Tony Goldwyn -- who plays President Fitzgerald Grant -- spoke to Mother Jones about politics and the inspiration for his performance.", "title": "'Scandal' star Tony Goldwyn names Bill Clinton, Obama as...", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://redalertpolitics.com/files/2014/09/scandal-president-fitz-600x341.jpg", "height": 341}, "url": "http://redalertpolitics.com/2014/09/25/scandal-star-tony-goldwyn-names-bill-clinton-obama-inspirations-president-fitz/", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 1285945407, "app_id": 529886110401651}, "msvalidate.01": "0F003B4674EABE0F24651B476B61A43C", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/RedAlertPolitics", "tag": "tony-goldwyn-inspiration-clinton-obama", "published_time": "2014-09-25T14:45:41+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-09-25T14:45:41+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "\u201cAll that these incredibly prominent, sophisticated, impressive people wanted to talk about was \u2018Scandal,'\u201d Goldwyn said of the event.\nI wanted Fitz to have that.\n\u201cFitz\u2019s presidency is about bringing the Republican Party back to something that makes some sense,\u201d alleged Goldwyn.\nIn advance of the season four premier of ABC\u2019s \u201cScandal\u201d Thursday night, actor Tony Goldwyn \u2014 who plays President Fitzgerald Grant \u2014 spoke to Mother Jones about politics and the inspiration for his performance.\nI suspect he was briefed.\u201dConsidering the amount of time Obama dedicates to the sport of golf, he likely makes a bit of downtime to watch \u201cScandal\u201d too."}
