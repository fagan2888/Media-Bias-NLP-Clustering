If you scroll over the map, you will see the number of customers each provider signed up.\n\nWhat you can see from this chart is that roughly two-thirds of the 370,000 people who enrolled in a qualified health plan came from New York City, Long Island and Westchester, meaning insurance companies that could not compete in those counties were left with few customers across the rest of the state.\n\nThat highlights a problem tens of thousands of New Yorkers are facing heading into the second year of enrollment.\n\nWhile state officials like to highlight the fact that 16 insurers offered dozens of plans on the exchange, this map illustrates that options begin to narrow outside of the New York City Metro area, possibly contributing to lower enrollment totals in upstate counties.\n\nSeveral counties north of Albany and west of Rochester offered only three or four insurance options on the individual market: Today's Options of New York; MVP Health Plan, Fidelis Care and Excellus.\n\nCapital's Nidhi Prakash reported last month that American Progressive Life & Health Insurance Company of New York, also known as Today\u2019s Options of New York, pulled out of the exchange. It operated in 37 counties across New York State, but only 384 people signed up for its plans. In many counties, it enrolled fewer than a dozen people.\n\nThat leaves three insurers, all of which have asked the state permission to raise rates by a significant amount.\n\nMVP is looking for a 19-percent increase, Excellus is pushing for almost a 20-percent increase and Fidelis is looking for a 7-percent increase. Capital District Health Plan, which is a fourth option found in several counties, is looking to raise their rates by 8.5 percent.\n\nThe bar chart below shows the proposed rate increases for the different plans\u2014platinum, gold, silver, and copper along with the market share.\n\nWhile those are only proposed rate increases, and Democrat senators have asked state superintendent of financial services Ben Lawsky to hold the line on rates, the message is clear: if you live in the more rural areas of the state, your premiums are almost certainly headed higher.\n\nThis is consistent with trends seen across the nation, according to a report from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.\n\nThe research found that rural county residents could choose from about 14 plans through four insurers compared to 17 plans and five insurers in more urban counties.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.capitalnewyork.com/article/albany/2014/08/8550405/rural-new-yorkers-could-see-biggest-insurance-hikes", "image": "http://www.capitalnewyork.com/sites/default/files/a%20-%20healthcare%20map_0.png", "type": "article", "title": "Rural New Yorkers could see biggest insurance hikes"}, "robots": "all", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "A breakdown of how NY's insurance plans performed through the end of open enrollment"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fccecf\"", "article_summary": "It operated in 37 counties across New York State, but only 384 people signed up for its plans.\nThe research found that rural county residents could choose from about 14 plans through four insurers compared to 17 plans and five insurers in more urban counties.\nCapital's Nidhi Prakash reported last month that American Progressive Life & Health Insurance Company of New York, also known as Today\u2019s Options of New York, pulled out of the exchange.\nThat highlights a problem tens of thousands of New Yorkers are facing heading into the second year of enrollment.\nSeveral counties north of Albany and west of Rochester offered only three or four insurance options on the individual market: Today's Options of New York; MVP Health Plan, Fidelis Care and Excellus."}
