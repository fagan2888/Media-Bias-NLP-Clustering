The editors, like many on the left, refuse to acknowledge that it is Obama\u2019s own radical policies, and imperious style, that led to the backlash that delivered Congress to the opposition in the first place. However, since the \u201cpaper of record\u201d attempts to rewrite history to back up its claims, the editorial is worth deconstructing.\n\nIt begins:\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nIt is a peculiar, but unmistakable, phenomenon: As Barack Obama\u2019s presidency heads into its twilight, the rage of the Republican establishment toward him is growing louder, angrier and more destructive.\n\nActually, what is remarkable about the \u201ctwilight\u201d of Obama\u2019s presidency is that he refuses to acknowledge his party\u2019s recent historic defeat. Instead of listening to the electorate, he is governing as if nothing happened, enacting more radical policies.\n\nRepublican lawmakers in Washington and around the country have been focused on blocking Mr. Obama\u2019s agenda and denigrating him personally since the day he took office in 2009.\n\nA blatant historical lie. The truth: in 2009, Republicans were unsure how to deal with their defeat, and many were eager to appease him. Bill Kristol even wrote on the Times\u2018 own op-ed page that Republicans ought to give Obama a chance to show that liberalism could be \u201ca service to our country.\u201d That honeymoon ended with the massive stimulus bill of February 2009, when Obama rejected Republican suggestions, telling them simply: \u201cI won.\u201d The result: the rise of the Tea Party movement.\n\nBut even against that backdrop, and even by the dismal standards of political discourse today, the tone of the current attacks is disturbing. So is their evident intent \u2014 to undermine not just Mr. Obama\u2019s policies, but his very legitimacy as president.\n\nNote how the Times does not acknowledge the tone of Obama\u2019s own attacks. There is no occasion that Obama will not use to denigrate and undermine his critics\u2013not even a supposed \u201csuccess\u201d like the Iran deal, when he attacked the \u201cinevitable critics\u201d and suggested that Congress could only act in bad faith (\u201cnot based on expert analysis, and without offering any reasonable alternative\u201d) in opposing it. He has undermined the legitimacy of Congress\u2013and of the Constitution itself.\n\nIt is a line of attack that echoes Republicans\u2019 earlier questioning of Mr. Obama\u2019s American citizenship. Those attacks were blatantly racist in their message \u2014 reminding people that Mr. Obama was black, suggesting he was African, and planting the equally false idea that he was secretly Muslim.\n\nAnother attempt to rewrite history. The first questions about Obama\u2019s citizenship, and the first attacks on his faith, came directly from the Hillary Clinton camp in 2008. No doubt the Times feels uncomfortable acknowledging that fact on the day that Hillary Clinton announces her new run for the presidency. The fact that a fringe of the GOP later embraced the Birther movement did not change the fact that it started with Clinton, nor make it the basis for Republican opposition.\n\nThe current offensive is slightly more subtle, but it is impossible to dismiss the notion that race plays a role in it. Perhaps the most outrageous example of the attack on the president\u2019s legitimacy was a letter signed by 47 Republican senators to the leadership of Iran saying Mr. Obama had no authority to conclude negotiations over Iran\u2019s nuclear weapons program.\n\nThe charge of racism is ridiculous, made more so by the example the Times chose. The Times also distorts the content of the letter. Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AK) and his colleagues did not say Obama \u201chad no authority to conclude negotiations.\u201d It said he shared that authority with Congress, such that any agreement he did conclude would only be an \u201cexecutive agreement\u201d and would not be binding on future presidents. The fact that the Times has to lie about the letter is telling.\n\nTry to imagine the outrage from Republicans if a similar group of Democrats had written to the Kremlin in 1986 telling Mikhail Gorbachev that President Ronald Reagan did not have the authority to negotiate a nuclear arms deal at the Reykjavik summit meeting that winter.\n\nAnother telling example. The difference between Reykjavik and Lausanne is that Reagan was willing to walk away from talks at Reykjavik! And the fact is that Democrats in Congress undertook many actions that undermined President Reagan and other Republican presidents. There were Ted Kennedy\u2019s overtures to the Soviets, John Kerry\u2019s outreach to the Sandinistas, Nancy Pelosi\u2019s coddling of Assad, and other examples. Does the Times really want to go there? No problem!\n\nThere is no functional difference between that example and the Iran talks, except that the congressional Republican caucus does not like Mr. Obama and wants to deny him any policy victory.\n\nIf that were true, Republicans would never have joined Democrats in ratifying the New START treaty, which they did in late 2010. That was a \u201cpolicy victory\u201d for Obama\u2013albeit one denied by Vladimir Putin, who responded by insisting it covered missile defense systems, and later by invading Ukraine. The Obama administration actually lied to Congress about past Russian violations of arms treaties in order to pass New START, so it is no wonder that Congress has become less trusting.\n\nOn April 3, Colbert King, a Washington Post columnist summarized a series of actions by Republicans attacking the president\u2019s authority in areas that most Americans thought had been settled by the Civil War. Arizona legislators, for example, have been working on a bill that \u201cprohibits this state or any of its political subdivisions from using any personnel or financial resources to enforce, administer or cooperate with an executive order issued by the president of the United States that has not been affirmed by a vote of Congress and signed into law as prescribed by the United States Constitution.\u201d\n\nAh, Arizona. That perennial punching bag. Remember the dreaded immigration law that was supposedly racist because it let police check immigrants\u2019 legal status? It was declared unconstitutional\u2013but only after the Supreme Court made clear that it was not actually racist to ask people to prove their legal status. Here we have another deliberate misreading of an Arizona bill, whose intent clearly is to shore up constitutional defenses that Congress\u2013and the media\u2013have failed to guard.\n\nThe bill sounds an awful lot like John C. Calhoun\u2019s secessionist screed of 1828, the South Carolina Exposition and Protest. Laurie Roberts of The Arizona Republic wrote that it was just \u201cone of a series of kooky measures aimed at declaring our independence from federal gun laws, from the Affordable Care Act, from the Environmental Protection Agency, from the Department of Justice, from Barack Obama.\u201d\n\nHere we have what might be called \u201cproof by liberal opinion columnist.\u201d A thin reed for a charge of racism, but never mind.\n\nRepublicans defend this sort of action by accusing Mr. Obama of acting like a king and citing executive actions he has taken \u2014 on immigration and pollution among other things. That\u2019s nonsense. The same Republicans had no objection when President George W. Bush used his executive authority to authorize the torture of terrorism suspects and tap the phones of American citizens. It is not executive orders the Republicans object to; it is Mr. Obama\u2019s policies, and Mr. Obama.\n\nFour points. 1. Obama\u2019s executive actions on immigration are illegal and unconstitutional, as stated 22 times by Obama himself. 2. Opposition to Obama\u2019s executive actions on \u201cpollution\u201d (i.e. carbon dioxide) is being led by the liberal Harvard professor Laurence Tribe\u2013as reported by a paper called the New York Times. 3. Bush\u2019s policies on \u201ctorture\u201d were based on interpretations of the law, and his wiretapping policies were explicitly authorized by statutes that Obama supported. 4. Obama\u2019s executive actions are deliberate attempts to evade the law and the Constitution\u2013and he, and the Times, know it.\n\nThe Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, who declared war on the new president in 2009 as minority leader and used the filibuster to paralyze the Senate, essentially told foreign governments to ignore the carbon-emission goals Mr. Obama was trying to set by international agreement. Because climate-change deniers in Congress and in some states oppose the effort, setting those goals is pointless, Mr. McConnell pronounced last month.\n\nAgain, some facts. McConnell had no filibuster for a significant period between 2009 and 2010, when Democrats held a 60-seat supermajority. He stopped exactly nothing from passing\u2013certainly not climate change legislation, which then-Majority Leader Harry Reid declined to bring to the floor because of Democratic opposition. McConnell did not address foreign governments (\u00e0 la Cotton) but state governments\u2013and some, including New York, agree with the substance of his criticism.\n\nIf this insurrection is driven by something other than a blend of ideological extremism and personal animosity, it is not clear what that might be. But it is ugly, it deepens mistrust of government and it harms the office of the president, not just Mr. Obama.\n\nOpposition to Obama is driven primarily by love of country and Constitution. False accusations of racism, on the other hand, are clearly driven by partisan hatred, and no small amount of sheer stupidity, from the Times\u2018 leading lights.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Fail: New York Times Tries to Play Race Card, Rewrite History", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Fail: New York Times Tries to Play Race Card, Rewrite History", "title": "Fail: New York Times Tries to Play Race Card, Rewrite History - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 475, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2014/12/New-York-Times-office.gif", "height": 356}, "updated_time": "2015-04-12T05:54:41-07:00", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-journalism/2015/04/12/fail-new-york-times-tries-to-play-race-card-rewrite-history/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Fail: New York Times Tries to Play Race Card, Rewrite History", "creator": "@joelpollak", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2014/12/New-York-Times-office.gif", "title": "Fail: New York Times Tries to Play Race Card, Rewrite History - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "app_id": 1243316582352556, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Constitution, executive orders, fisking, iran deal, Mitch McConnell, New York Times, opposition, race card, Tom Cotton,Big Journalism, Obama, Racism,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "published_time": "2015-04-12T05:54:26-07:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/joelpollak", "section": "Big Journalism", "modified_time": "2015-04-12T05:54:41-07:00", "tag": "Tom Cotton", "categories": "Big Journalism,Obama,Racism"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce909\"", "article_summary": "Obama\u2019s executive actions are deliberate attempts to evade the law and the Constitution\u2013and he, and the Times, know it.\nSo is their evident intent \u2014 to undermine not just Mr. Obama\u2019s policies, but his very legitimacy as president.\nBut it is ugly, it deepens mistrust of government and it harms the office of the president, not just Mr. Obama.\nIt is not executive orders the Republicans object to; it is Mr. Obama\u2019s policies, and Mr. Obama.\nObama\u2019s executive actions on immigration are illegal and unconstitutional, as stated 22 times by Obama himself."}
