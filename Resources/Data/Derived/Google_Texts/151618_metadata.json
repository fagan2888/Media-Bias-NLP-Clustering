But Aspen, Vail and the like are at the top of the list. And while you might expect to find pricier cities like New York, San Francisco or Los Angeles to be among the top 10 for insurance premiums, they take a back seat to such places as Southern Georgia and rural Nevada.\n\nSome of the higher pricing can be attributed to the lack of competition in the regions; many states have only one or two insurers covering virtually the entire region. But it appears a lot of it is simply due to the actuarial tables.\n\nHere\u2019s Kaiser\u2019s list. Prices are premiums for the lowest-cost silver plan for a 40-year-old person:\n\n1. Colorado Mountain Resorts: Eagle, Garfield and Pitkin counties. Aspen and Vail ski resorts included \u2014 $483.\n\n2. Southwest Georgia: Baker, Calhoun, Clay, Crisp, Dougherty, Lee, Mitchell, Randolph, Schley, Sumter, Terrell and Worth counties \u2013 $461.\n\n3. Rural Nevada: Esmeralda, Eureka, Humboldt, Lander, Lincoln, Elko, Mineral, Pershing, White Pine and Churchill counties \u2013 $456.\n\n4. Western Wisconsin: Pierce, Polk and St. Croix counties \u2014 $445.\n\n5. Southern Georgia: Ben Hill, Berrien, Brooks, Clinch, Colquitt, Cook, Decatur, Early, Echols, Grady, Irwin, Lanier, Lowndes, Miller, Seminole, Thomas, Tift and Turner counties \u2014 $423.\n\n6. Most of Wyoming: Natrona and Laramie counties excluded \u2014 $405.\n\n7. Southeast Mississippi: George, Harrison, Jackson and Stone counties \u2014 $399.\n\n8. All of Vermont: $395.\n\n9. Southwest Connecticut: Fairfield County \u2014 $383.\n\n10. All of Alaska: $381.\n\nFollow Russ Britt on Twitter @russbrittmktw\n\nFollow Health Exchange on Twitter @MWHealthBlog\n\nMore health-care news from MarketWatch:\n\nPfizer shares boosted on positive cancer treatment results\n\nMillions of insured workers seen shifting to private health exchanges\n\nMore positive hep C tests boost AbbVie, Enanta", "article_metadata": {"article.created": "2014-02-03T13:04:46-05:00", "application-name": "MarketWatch.com", "twitter": {"domain": "Marketwatch.com", "description": "Kaiser Health News has published with a list of the 10 most expensive areas in the U.S. to buy health insurance now that Obamacare is in effect.", "title": "The 10 most expensive areas to buy health insurance in the U.S.", "url": "http://blogs.marketwatch.com/health-exchange/2014/02/03/the-10-most-expensive-areas-to-buy-health-insurance-in-the-u-s/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/MWimages/MW-BT876_aspen__MG_20140203123144.jpg"}, "site": "MarketWatch", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.author": "Russ Britt", "article.section": "Markets", "keywords": "health care,health insurance rates,Obamacare", "article.headline": "The 10 most expensive areas to buy health insurance in the U.S.", "msapplication-task": "name=SmartMoney;action-uri=http://www.smartmoney.com/;icon-uri=http://www.smartmoney.com/favicon.ico", "news_keywords": "health care,health insurance rates,Obamacare", "author": "Russ Britt", "article.page": "Health Exchange Blog", "description": "Kaiser Health News has published with a list of the 10 most expensive areas in the U.S. to buy health insurance now that Obamacare is in effect.", "article.published": "2014-02-03T13:04:46-05:00", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "msapplication-tooltip": "MarketWatch", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.marketwatch.com/health-exchange/2014/02/03/the-10-most-expensive-areas-to-buy-health-insurance-in-the-u-s/", "app_id": 283204329838}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/marketwatch", "image_count": 2}, "og": {"site_name": "Marketwatch", "description": "Kaiser Health News has published with a list of the 10 most expensive areas in the U.S. to buy health insurance now that Obamacare is in effect.", "title": "The 10 most expensive areas to buy health insurance in the U.S.", "url": "http://blogs.marketwatch.com/health-exchange/2014/02/03/the-10-most-expensive-areas-to-buy-health-insurance-in-the-u-s/", "image": {"width": 569, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/MWimages/MW-BT876_aspen__MG_20140203123144.jpg", "height": 398}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Health Exchange", "article.id": "BL-MW243B-1983", "article.updated": "2014-02-03T13:04:46-05:00"}, "article_summary": "Kaiser Health News has published a list of the 10 areas where health insurance is most expensive in the U.S. now that Obamacare is in effect.\nBut Aspen, Vail and the like are at the top of the list.\nSouthwest Georgia: Baker, Calhoun, Clay, Crisp, Dougherty, Lee, Mitchell, Randolph, Schley, Sumter, Terrell and Worth counties \u2013 $461.\nShutterstock Region including Aspen resort has high health insurance ratesMaybe it\u2019s the risk involved with skiing, or perhaps the population there is generally older AND more adventurous on the slopes \u2014 undoubtedly a bad combination.\nCollecting data from the Kaiser Family Foundation, the government\u2019s HealthCare.gov website and state exchanges, the health news website has determined that the most expensive area in the U.S. to purchase coverage is \u2014 drumroll, please \u2014 Colorado mountain resorts."}
