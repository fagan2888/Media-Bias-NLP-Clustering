Check out the Maraudres\u2019 trophy case, which is already filling up.\n\nThis spring, the Marauders took home the top prize for the first time at the Passaic River Sprints, besting Don Bosco, Nutley, Belleville, Kearny, Ridgewood, North Arlington, and St. Benedicts, programs which have been around for decades.\n\nIn 2013, the Marauders took first place in the Stotesbury Cup, the largest high school race in the country. That same year, they won the Scholastic Rowing Association of America National Championship.\n\nThis year, the Marauders placed second in both competitions.\n\n\u201cI remember going to the Stotesbury Cup my sophomore year and being told it was an unwinnable race,\u201d said Chris Kuczynski, a senior who will captain this year\u2019s Prep team. \u201cOne year later we ended up winning that race, as well as nationals. That was a big confidence booster for us.\u201d\n\nKuczynski joined the Prep team as a freshman with no rowing experience. That\u2019s not uncommon among the Marauders.\n\nDespite all of their success, the Marauders do come from humble beginnings. In 2010 the program consisted of roughly 20 rowers with no experience.\n\nYet, next season they will boast a roster of 55 rowers. According to head coach Alex Canale, the key to their rapid success has been twofold \u2014 a robust mixture of dedication from the athletes and steadfast support from parents.\n\n\u201cThe students we have are really driven and are a close knit group,\u201d Canale said. \u201cThey work together and take care of each other. It leads to a team mentality that you can\u2019t really teach.\u201d\n\nThe Marauders ability to learn quickly on the water may not come as a surprise given that last year\u2019s graduating class boasted 12 National Honor Society members. It's a team that certainly prides itself on being scholar athletes.\n\n2014 graduate Hank Forsythe will be attending the U.S. Naval Academy this fall as a member of their rowing team. In addition, over the last four years the school has sent rowers to Hobart, Marist, William & Mary, Ohio State, Delaware and Virginia Tech.\n\nRowing is perhaps one of the most expensive high school sports in the country, with a single oar costing roughly $400. This certainly hindered St. Peter\u2019s Prep in the early stages of its program.\n\nThat\u2019s where the parents stepped in.\n\nSince the program\u2019s inception, parents and the Prep community and have raised $130,000 towards team equipment.\n\n\u201cWe had a boat lose by .15 of a second,\u201d said former Prep Crew Parents Association president and current Prep Crew Parents Association senior board member Mike Lyons. \u201cEquipment makes all the difference.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"article_author": "Max Tyler | The Jersey Journal", "medium": "news", "news_keywords": "jersey-city", "title": "They're off & rowing", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"They\\u0027re off & rowing\", \"link\": \"http://www.nj.com/jjournal-news/index.ssf/2014/08/theyre_off_rowing.html\", \"image_url\": \"\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"13658610\", \"pub_date\": \"2014-08-16T07:00:44Z\", \"author\": \"Max Tyler | The Jersey Journal\", \"tags\": [\"jersey-city\"] }", "twitter": {"image": "http://media.nj.com/design/alpha/img/logo_njo.gif", "description": "For a rowing program born just 4 1/2 years ago, St. Peter&#8217;s Prep has quickly established itself as a premier power - not only in New Jersey, but also across the country.", "card": "summary", "site": "@njdotcom"}, "article_date_updated": "Saturday, August 16, 2014,  3:00 AM", "parsely-metadata": "{\"image_url\": \"\", \"author_name\": \"MalcolmTyler\", \"author_nickname\": \"Max Tyler | The Jersey Journal\", \"author_id\": \"11745459\", \"source_blog_name\": \"Jersey Journal Print Edition\", \"source_blog_url\": \"http://www.nj.com/jjournal-news/index.ssf/\", \"sponsored_content\": \"0\" }", "og": {"site_name": "NJ.com", "description": "For a rowing program born just 4 1/2 years ago, St. Peter&#8217;s Prep has quickly established itself as a premier power - not only in New Jersey, but also across the country.", "title": "They're off & rowing", "url": "http://www.nj.com/jjournal-news/index.ssf/2014/08/theyre_off_rowing.html", "image": "http://media.nj.com/design/alpha/img/logo_njo.gif", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "NJ.com", "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Saturday, August 16, 2014,  3:00 AM", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "Description": "For a rowing program born just 4 1/2 years ago, St. Peter&#8217;s Prep has quickly established itself as a premier power - not only in New Jersey, but also across the country."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc96bf\"", "article_summary": "That same year, they won the Scholastic Rowing Association of America National Championship.\nThat was a big confidence booster for us.\u201dKuczynski joined the Prep team as a freshman with no rowing experience.\nNaval Academy this fall as a member of their rowing team.\n\u201cWe had a boat lose by .15 of a second,\u201d said former Prep Crew Parents Association president and current Prep Crew Parents Association senior board member Mike Lyons.\nIn 2013, the Marauders took first place in the Stotesbury Cup, the largest high school race in the country."}
