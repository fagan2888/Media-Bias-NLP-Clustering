Three more potential victims have surfaced in the case of an HIV-positive police officer who was charged last week on two counts of criminal transmission of HIV, a first-degree felony.

The Palm Beach Post reports that Ervans Saintclair, an officer in the Greenacres Police Department, tested positive for HIV during a pre-employment exam in 2007. The unidentified Quincy doctor who made the diagnosis had assured the department it would not impede his work.

The investigation of Saintclair by the Palm Beach County Sheriffâ€™s Department began last year after a woman told detectives Saintclair had unprotected sex with her in 2007 -- after he got the diagnosis -- without telling her of his HIV status. The statute of limitations had run out in that case, the Post reports, but that woman helped find other women who had unprotected sex with Saintclair more recently.

Saintclair is charged with two counts of criminal transmission of HIV, a felony. He has bonded out of jail but has been placed on administrative leave without pay.
