(Photo: Joshua Smith/Palladium-Item)Buy Photo Story Highlights Reid Hospital and other area organizations are eager to enroll area residents in HIP 2.0.\n\nAbout half of the 25,000 uninsured in the Reid service area are HIP 2.0 eligible.\n\nReid is planning be special enrollment event 3-6 p.m. Feb. 26 in Lingle Hall at Reid.\n\nSome people already enrolled in marketplace plans are eligible for HIP 2.0 and must change plans.\n\nSignificant efforts are underway to enroll area residents who are now eligible for health insurance through Indiana\u2019s newly approved HIP 2.0 plan.\n\nThe Healthy Indiana Plan (HIP) 2.0, approved last week by the federal government, is designed to insure Hoosiers who have incomes between 100 and 138 percent of the Federal Poverty Level.\n\nOf the more than 25,000 people in the Reid Hospital service area who remain uninsured, about half of them are eligible for HIP 2.0, hospital officials said.\n\nMost of those now eligible are working families who previously were ineligible for Medicaid or the Affordable Care Act insurance offered in the Health Insurance Marketplace.\n\n\u201cThis is a very important thing for Indiana,\u201d said Reid Hospital president and CEO Craig Kinyon. \u201cWe don\u2019t have this gap in the middle anymore.\u201d\n\nReid and other businesses and organizations are planning special events and making more people available to help area residents sign up for the new plan.\n\nReid is planning a special enrollment event for 3-6 p.m. Feb. 26 in Lingle Hall at Reid.\n\nSara Hall, enrollment specialist with Meridian Health Services, was scheduled to answer Affordable Care Act and HIP 2.0 questions from 10 a.m. to noon Wednesday at Morrisson-Reeves Library in Richmond.\n\n\u201cThe state has done an awesome job with the HIP 2.0 program. Now that their plan has rolled out, I love it. It\u2019s a great plan,\u201d Hall said. \u201cIt will definitely help the people who make too much money to qualify for Medicaid but not enough money to get a plan on the marketplace. I think it will be a great opportunity to get people in the door and offer them affordable health care.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to at least investigate this,\u201d Kinyon encourages area residents. \u201cDon\u2019t be constrained by past rejections. Don\u2019t make the assumption that it\u2019s the same as in the past.\u201d\n\nGenerally, Hoosiers who qualify for HIP 2.0 are ages 19 to 64 with incomes of $16,297 for an individual, $21,967 for a couple and $33,307 for a family of four.\n\nJessica Stanton, health insurance agent with VanVleet Insurance in Richmond, said some area residents who have been enrolled in an Affordable Care Act insurance plan through the health marketplace are now eligible for HIP 2.0. If eligible, they must enroll and cannot continue to use their marketplace plan.\n\n\u201cIf someone becomes eligible for HIP 2.0 and does not make the conversion from Obamacare to HIP 2.0, they will have to pay all of the tax credits back when they file their taxes,\u201d Stanton said.\n\nThe Health Marketplace might not recognize or terminate a person\u2019s coverage automatically, so people need to update their account in the marketplace, according to Indiana\u2019s Family and Social Services Administration. Additionally, enrolling in HIP 2.0 might provide more comprehensive medical coverage than a marketplace plan, such as vision and dental services.\n\nKinyon said there will be some understandable complications and confusion as area residents enter the enrollment process.\n\nThat\u2019s why Reid is arranging numerous sign-up sessions with representatives from ClaimAid, a company that Reid contracts to provide experts who work with customers to enroll them in Medicaid, HIP and HIP 2.0. ClaimAid\u2019s services are provided at no charge to area residents.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to spread this around like butter to get people engaged in the application process,\u201d Kinyon said.\n\nArea residents can begin signing up for HIP 2.0 right away at Reid\u2019s Patient Financial Services office, Reid Urgent Care in Richmond, the main hospital campus and on Thursdays at Whitewater Valley Urgent Care in Connersville.\n\nReid also is planning sign-up and informational sessions in the coming weeks in partnership with Richmond Community Schools, the United Way of Whitewater Valley, the Natco Empowerment Center and the Wayne Township Trustee\u2019s Office.\n\nPalladium-Item reporter Bill Engle contributed to this story.\n\nWhere to enroll in HIP 2.0\n\n\u2022Reid Hospital Patient Financial Services office, 1501 Chester Blvd., which is open 8 a.m.-4:30 p.m. Monday-Friday.
