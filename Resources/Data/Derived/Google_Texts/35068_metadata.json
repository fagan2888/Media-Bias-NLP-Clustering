Like others waiting outside First Presbyterian's doors, Erikson was appreciative of the church's service.\n\n\"I'm currently homeless right now and pretty cold, so I'm hoping I can get inside right when the doors open,\" Erikson said. \"This is my first year attending this service, but the amount of people waiting does seem pretty big.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"I think with it being so cold and how much it's been snowing all day, these guys just want to get inside, too.\"\n\nWhile most of First Presbyterian's meal services offer food in a buffet arrangement, the Thanksgiving dinner is designed to bring those in attendance closer together in a family-style setting.\n\nLocated where the old basketball court previously was housed, attendees sat together at round tables and were served by volunteers acting as a wait staff, rather than the diners having to serve themselves.\n\n\"It's actually a lot of fun having this event here every year,\" said Mark Culver, a deacon at First Presbyterian. \"Between all the guests and volunteers that show up on Thanksgiving, you tend to meet plenty of interesting people if you get to talking to them.\"\n\nWhile the colder weather and snowy conditions led to a large number of attendees this year, the church also provided an increased amount of food and volunteers.\n\nThis year's dinner featured 32 turkeys, and the large meal was prepared and served by about 80 volunteers \u2014 65 percent of which either work with or are considered friends of the church.\n\nThe church worked overtime in planning and preparing for the Thanksgiving event.\n\n\"We started cooking and carving the turkeys earlier this week, but the real preparation for all the work and volunteering started all the way back in mid-September,\" Culver said.\n\nAlong with the free Thanksgiving meal provided by First Presbyterian Church, holiday celebrations and meals also took place at the OUR Center in Longmont. That meal was provided by Old Chicago and served from 10:30 a.m. to 2 p.m.\n\nWhile the day's event at First Presbyterian was meant to provide an amenity for those in need, it also served to highlight the growing problem of homelessness and hunger in the United States, one that continues to go relatively unnoticed by the public.\n\nAttendees enjoy Thanksgiving dinner together at First Presbyterian Church in Boulder on Thursday afternoon. (Jeremy Papasso / Staff Photographer)\n\nThis year, when asked about the most important problem facing the United States today, only 3 percent of Americans responded that they believed poverty and homelessness were at the forefront, according to data from Statista.\n\nStanding outside First Presbyterian on Thursday, a homeless man who wished only to be identified as Brian offered his thoughts on the day's service.\n\n\"I can't say I'm too happy with my circumstances right now \u2014 I am honestly just cold and hungry,\" he said. \"I will say, though, that I do appreciate these kind of services. They sometimes make the situation bearable.\"", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/news/boulder/ci_29170101/boulders-first-presbyterian-serves-thanksgiving-dinner-and-warm", "sailthru.author": "By Anthony Hahn \n  For the Camera", "ag": {"canon": "BoulderDailyCamera:article:29170101:view"}, "startDate": "2015-11-26T16:51:03-0700", "twitter": {"domain": "dailycamera.com", "description": "The Thanksgiving dinner, a staple at First Presbyterian for its parishioners and local attendees for the last 20 years, is one of the largest holiday feedings for the needy provided in Boulder.", "title": "Boulder's First Presbyterian serves Thanksgiving dinner \u2014 and a warm escape \u2014 to the needy", "url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/news/boulder/ci_29170101/boulders-first-presbyterian-serves-thanksgiving-dinner-and-warm", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2015/1126/20151126__27DCATHAw~2.jpg", "site": "@dailycamera", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "sailthru.section": "Boulder News", "modificationDate": "2015-11-26T18:00:00-0700", "endDate": "2025-11-26T16:49:58-0700", "news_keywords": "Boulder News, Boulder News news, Boulder Colorado Boulder News news, Boulder Colorado news, Boulder News Boulder news, Boulder News Colorado news, US Boulder News news, world Boulder News news.", "byline": "By Anthony HahnFor", "pubDate": "2015-11-26T16:52:41-0700", "sailthru.date": "2015-11-26T16:51:03-0700", "sailthru.title": "Boulder's First Presbyterian serves Thanksgiving dinner &mdash; and a warm escape &mdash; to the needy", "verify-v1": "TakAiHiDAOiNOP+m0YTx4DQeyjor+bTdc8e+pw6bDoI=", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2015/1126/20151126__27DCATHAw~1_300.jpg", "description": "The Thanksgiving dinner, a staple at First Presbyterian for its parishioners and local attendees for the last 20 years, is one of the largest holiday feedings for the needy provided in Boulder.", "sailthru.site": "dailycamera.com", "msvalidate.01": "9DAB14005AD5A9FFA4CA0EF58CC794BA", "og": {"url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/news/boulder/ci_29170101/boulders-first-presbyterian-serves-thanksgiving-dinner-and-warm", "image": "http://extras.dailycamera.com/images/dailycamera3.png", "type": "article", "description": "The Thanksgiving dinner, a staple at First Presbyterian for its parishioners and local attendees for the last 20 years, is one of the largest holiday feedings for the needy provided in Boulder.", "title": "Boulder's First Presbyterian serves Thanksgiving dinner \u2014 and a warm escape \u2014 to the needy"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "867892b0357001538903740c75a206f0"}, "google-site-verification": "07CC1xPDVU0znu496XTAjLyC32Ylj8zwWHlmrzx3pgY", "y_key": "c9d9b53f7f5af674", "sailthru.image.full": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2015/1126/20151126__27DCATHAw~1.jpg"}, "article_summary": "David Edwin-Ward, left, talks to Harold Smith during the annual Thanksgiving dinner at First Presbyterian Church in Boulder on Thursday.\nAttendees enjoy Thanksgiving dinner together at First Presbyterian Church in Boulder on Thursday afternoon.\nAlong with the free Thanksgiving meal provided by First Presbyterian Church, holiday celebrations and meals also took place at the OUR Center in Longmont.\nMore than 300 people come in from the cold for annual holiday mealOn a particularly cold and snowy Thanksgiving Day, more than 300 people packed into Boulder's First Presbyterian Church for its annual holiday dinner.\nThe Thanksgiving dinner, a staple at First Presbyterian for its parishioners and local attendees for the last 20 years, is one of the largest holiday feedings for the needy provided in Boulder."}
