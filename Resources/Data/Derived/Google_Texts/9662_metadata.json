The law\u2019s second annual open enrollment period runs between Nov. 15, 2014 and Feb. 15, 2015. If you want a new plan in place by the start of 2015, you\u2019ll have to enroll by no later than Dec. 15.\n\nThis three-month period is likely the only chance you\u2019ll have to pick up a health insurance policy for 2015 or switch to a new plan that may better meet your needs.\n\nHere\u2019s a checklist of items to keep in mind as you shop.\n\nYou Need to Update Your Personal Information\n\nIf you\u2019re among the more than 6 million Americans who qualified for federal tax subsidies when you bought insurance through the exchanges set up under Obamacare, now\u2019s the time to update your financial information with the exchange, particularly if your income is different than what you reported last year or if you\u2019ve experienced any major life changes, such as a job loss, marriage or the birth of a baby.\n\n\u201cUpdate your financial information, both to get the right premium tax credit and because your eligibility for cost-sharing reductions might also change,\u201d says JoAnn Volk, a senior research fellow with the Georgetown University Center on Health Insurance Reforms.\n\nUnless your plan was discontinued for 2015, you\u2019ll automatically be re-enrolled in your current plan, along with the subsidy you\u2019re due \u2013 an amount the federal government will confirm based on your tax information.\n\nAnother reason to update your information: The formula for determining subsidies changes each year. That\u2019s likely to impact how much you\u2019ll pay for your plan, even if nothing about your situation has changed, says Karen Pollitz, a senior fellow with the Kaiser Family Foundation.\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t update your application for financial assistance, the current amount of your advanced premium tax credit will be continued. It\u2019s almost a lock [that] it won\u2019t be accurate,\u201d Pollitz says. The difference, she says, \u201cMay only be a couple bucks, but you should check.\u201d\n\nYou want to avoid getting a smaller subsidy than you\u2019re eligible for because you\u2019ll pay more each month for insurance than you need to. And if your income is inaccurate in the system and it causes you to get a larger subsidy than you\u2019re entitled to, you\u2019ll get a bill to repay the difference when you file your 2014 taxes.\n\n\u201cWhen you take your tax credit [during the year], you\u2019re getting it in advance of the amount you\u2019re eligible for, and when you file taxes the IRS will calculate what you are actually eligible to receive,\u201d Pollitz says.\n\nReview Changes to Health Plan Costs\n\nBy now, you should have already gotten a notice from your insurer letting you know what your premium will be for 2015 and any other changes to your existing plan, like what you\u2019ll be required to pay in out-of-pocket costs when you go for care. \u201cFor almost everyone, out-of-pocket costs will go up,\" Pollitz says. \"Grab your wallet.\"\n\nFor 2015, the maximum out-of-pocket costs are increasing from $6,350 to $6,600 for an individual policy holder. Those with family plans will see a jump from $12,700 to $13,200 next year for services covered by your plan.\n\n\u201cThe notices you get [from your insurer] are supposed to point out how your plan will be different, but it\u2019s something you should pay attention to and dig a little deeper to understand,\u201d Volk says. \u201cCertainly, if you weren\u2019t happy with your plan, this is an opportunity to go shopping and see what you would do differently.\"\n\nMany people will have more insurance plans to choose from this year. According to the Department of Health and Human Services, there will be a 25 percent increase in the number of insurers offering Marketplace coverage in 2015.\n\nAlthough you can\u2019t enroll in a plan until Nov. 15, you can begin to shop your options now at Healthcare.gov.\n\nPay Attention to Changes to Provider and Pharmacy Networks\n\nConfirm that your doctors and medications are covered by your insurance plan. And don\u2019t assume that by staying with the same policy you had this year, all those features will remain the same for 2015. \u201cPlans always change,\u201d Pollitz says. That means you need to carefully inspect a plan\u2019s drug formulary and what you\u2019ll be required to pay for different types of medications, including generics, brand-name and specialty drugs.\n\nThere may also be changes to the provider network. \u201cMaybe it was PPO this year and will now be an HMO,\u201d Pollitz says. If it\u2019s important to you to be able to see a particular doctor, be sure to check with both your insurer and your doctor\u2019s office to confirm that he or she participates with the plan you choose.\n\nAvoid Being Double Billed\n\nHealthcare.gov doesn\u2019t currently have an automated process for letting insurance carriers know when their members choose to enroll in a different policy. That means if you decide to switch to a different plan for next year, you\u2019d be wise to take it upon yourself to cancel your old plan to avoid being double billed, says Carrie McLean, customer service director with eHealthInsurance.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t put the onus on the exchange to tell your carrier you no longer want the policy,\u201d McLean says. \u201cCancel your old plan for the date your new plan takes effect.\"\n\nTo be safe, make sure to keep all documents showing you\u2019ve paid for your new policy and proof you\u2019ve canceled your old one, McLean says.\n\nGet Help Signing Up\n\nDon\u2019t let confusion about which plan to choose or how to update your personal information stop you from taking action. There are a number of ways to get free, personalized help.\n\neHealth, for example, offers a subsidy help center with a host of resources to help consumers navigate open enrollment.\n\nAnd you can find help in your area on Healthcare.gov, where you\u2019ll be able to tap into listings of local insurance brokers certified to sell insurance through Obamacare exchanges, as well as navigators or assistors who have been trained to help. You can also call the federal consumer assistance center at 800-318-2596.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"usn-stitial-fact": "{\"slug\":\"160202\",\"text\":\"Risk factors for heart failure are coronary heart disease, high blood pressure and diabetes.\"}", "usn-comments-mode": "facebook", "description": "Update your personal information, review changes to health plan costs and more tasks to keep in mind.", "zone": "healthplans/homepage/articles", "author": "Lisa Zamosky", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "Update your personal information, review changes to health plan costs and more tasks to keep in mind.", "title": "A Checklist for Obamacare Open Enrollment", "url": "http://health.usnews.com/health-news/health-insurance/articles/2014/11/11/a-checklist-for-obamacare-open-enrollment", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/8b/a6/f33a329246f3847a21c5c0446be3/141110-checklist-stock", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"title": "A Checklist for Obamacare Open Enrollment - US News", "description": "Update your personal information, review changes to health plan costs and more tasks to keep in mind.", "card": "summary", "site": "@USNews"}, "usn-platform-id": "a", "site": "health-news", "keywords": "LTHealth [Consumer Advice],healthwellness [Consumer Advice],Affordable Care Act,health care reform,health insurance,eHealth [Consumer Advice],Lisa Zamosky", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "social_id": "http://t.usnews.com/Z4257b", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "published_at": "2014-11-11", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/usnewsandworldreport", "published_time": "2014-11-11"}, "usn-content-type": "article", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/dims4/USNEWS/9ab7b0f/2147483647/thumbnail/80x80/quality/85/?url=%2Fcmsmedia%2F8b%2Fa6%2Ff33a329246f3847a21c5c0446be3%2F141110-checklist-stock", "viewport": "width=980", "news_keywords": "obamacare, ACA, open enrollment, health insurance"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf60e\"", "article_summary": "If you\u2019re considering buying Obamacare health insurance, you\u2019ll have a smaller window to shop for coverage this year.\neHealth, for example, offers a subsidy help center with a host of resources to help consumers navigate open enrollment.\nThe law\u2019s second annual open enrollment period runs between Nov. 15, 2014 and Feb. 15, 2015.\nIf you want a new plan in place by the start of 2015, you\u2019ll have to enroll by no later than Dec. 15.\nPay Attention to Changes to Provider and Pharmacy NetworksConfirm that your doctors and medications are covered by your insurance plan."}
