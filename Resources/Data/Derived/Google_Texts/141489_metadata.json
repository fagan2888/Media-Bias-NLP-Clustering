It's been a special rivalry over the course of my career against the Patriots,\u201d Manning told reporters.\n\n\u201cTo play four times in the AFC Championship, with so much on the line, those games have been very special so I just wanted to take the time to share with Tom and Bill how much respect I have for them.\u201d\n\nThe mutual respect has been earned over years of tussling. Manning and Brady have now faced off 17 times, with five of them coming in the post-season.\n\nBrady has a 11-6 record in their head-to-head clashes.\n\nManning was long considered the gunslinger who smashed records en route to five regular-season MVP awards, while Brady was the gritty winner who has accumulated four Super Bowl titles.\n\nBut since Manning left Indianapolis and joined Denver for the 2012 season he has flipped the script in beating Brady in both of their AFC title tilts.\n\nManning now heads for his fourth Super Bowl appearance with a 13-13 overall playoff record.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a great player, someone I\u2019ve always admired,\u201d Brady conceded following defeat. \u201c(The Broncos) have got a great team.\u201d\n\nManning\u2019s journey back to the Super Bowl this season was paved with more hardship than ever.\n\nAfter a four interception game in November, a combination of performance and a foot injury saw him benched in favor of backup Brock Osweiler.\n\nFor the latter part of this campaign, Manning\u2019s health has been a day-by-day challenge.\n\nThen last month, a report by Al Jazeera claimed that shipments of human growth hormone (HGH) were sent to Manning's home in 2011, when the quarterback had neck surgery.\n\nManning strongly denied the claim, and made a return to the field in relief of Osweiler in a season finale victory against San Diego.\n\nManning will turn 40 in March and he would not speculate following the victory, but chose to bask in another victory against his premier peer.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve stated my entire career, I have great respect for Tom as a player and as a friend for the job he has done as a QB for that franchise,\u201d Manning said.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no question this is a sweet day. This is a sweet victory.\u201d\n\n(Editing by Andrew Both)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The Patriots have long been a roadblock in the way of Manning\u2019s path to the Super Bowl", "title": "Manning gets perhaps final word in rivalry with Brady", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/01/24/Manning-gets-perhaps-final-word-rivalry-Brady", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/nfl_2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/01/24/Manning-gets-perhaps-final-word-rivalry-Brady", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/nfl_2.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "The Patriots have long been a roadblock in the way of Manning\u2019s path to the Super Bowl", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "It's been a special rivalry over the course of my career against the Patriots,\u201d Manning told reporters.\nManning and Brady have now faced off 17 times, with five of them coming in the post-season.\nManning now heads for his fourth Super Bowl appearance with a 13-13 overall playoff record.\n\u201c(The Broncos) have got a great team.\u201dManning\u2019s journey back to the Super Bowl this season was paved with more hardship than ever.\nManning was long considered the gunslinger who smashed records en route to five regular-season MVP awards, while Brady was the gritty winner who has accumulated four Super Bowl titles."}
