NEW YORK (MainStreet) —Government subsidies can make your monthly health insurance premiums more affordable, but make sure you avoid some common mistakes when signing up for them.

Consumers should conduct some research to see if they qualify for any subsidies as they search for the right plan and coverage during open enrollment, which does not end until February 15. Eschewing the purchase of health insurance altogether is not a solution since consumers are on the hook for 2% of their salary to the government for 2015.

Health insurance subsidies are given out to household incomes which typically fall between 133% and 400% of the federal poverty level or up to about $46,000 for a single person or $95,000 for a family of four. Applying for subsidies can be a bit of a challenge and it can be easy to slip up.

One of the three key mistakes to avoid when applying for subsidies during the current open enrollment period is not to get carried away with your deductions, said Carrie McLean, director of customer care at eHealth.com, an online health insurance exchange based in Mountain View, Calif.

“When applying for health insurance premium subsidies, applicants are sometimes tempted to treat the process like doing their taxes and get a little over creative with their deductions,” she said.

While you should report any deductions that are appropriate, be aware that adding too many can push your income too low; in that case, you may no longer be eligible for subsidies, but potentially eligible for Medicaid instead.
