In our last installment, we addressed how to determine whether a business is subject to the law\u2019s employer mandate. The next question is obvious: If a business is subject to the mandate, to which employees must it offer insurance in order to avoid the penalty?\n\nOn the surface, the rule seems straightforward: Every full-time employee \u2014 that is, anyone who puts in 30 hours of service a week, or 130 hours a month \u2014 is entitled to an offer of coverage from the company for that month (the monthly figure is 130 hours rather than 120 hours because most months are a few days longer than four weeks).\n\nFor companies where work schedules are consistent or those that offer health insurance broadly, the method for determining employee status is also pretty straightforward: The employer counts up the hours for each calendar month and makes sure each full-time employee has an offer of coverage that month (or the business prepares to pay a penalty). The Internal Revenue Service calls this the \u201cmonthly measurement method.\u201d\n\nBut things become complicated when employee hours vary week to week or month to month: How can an employer know whether a worker with fluctuating hours will be entitled to insurance in advance of a given month? And, really, what company is going to offer health insurance on a month-to-month basis?\n\nThe answers to these thorny questions are found in what the I.R.S. calls the \u201clook-back measurement method.\u201d Essentially, the rules give companies the option to determine whether \u201cvariable-hour\u201d employees are full time in the current year by calculating their average hours of service in the previous year. Hours of service, by the way, can include time for which employees are paid even when they are not performing work, such as for vacations, sick leave or jury duty.\n\nIt works like this: A company establishes a \u201cmeasurement period\u201d of three months to a year. Immediately after the measurement period is a \u201cstability period.\u201d Employees whose actual hours of service average out to full time in the measurement period are deemed full time in the stability period; they must be offered insurance or the company could face a penalty.\n\nThe stability period must be at least six months long and cannot be shorter than the measurement period. In between the measurement and stability periods, a company may also establish an administrative period of up to 90 days, to allow it to make offers of coverage and send out enrollment information.\n\nIn practice, lawyers say, most companies will operate with a one-year measurement period from Oct. 15 through Oct. 14 of the following year, followed by an administrative period through Dec. 31, and then a stability period running from Jan. 1 through Dec. 31.\n\nA company calculates the hours of service during the measurement period for an hourly employee by checking its records. It can do likewise for salaried workers, or it can simply credit an employee with eight hours for every day worked. But the rule makes special provisions for certain circumstances \u2014 the company, for example, has to count certain unpaid leave, for military service, say, or provided under the Family and Medical Leave Act.\n\nDisability is particularly thorny, said Leigh C. Riley, a benefits lawyer in Milwaukee. The regulations require \u201cevery hour that you\u2019re paid by your employer\u201d to be counted, she said. But, she added, long-term disability is typically covered by the company\u2019s insurance: \u201cWhat do you do if your disability is paid by an insurance carrier?\u201d Ms. Riley said she believed that time spent on long-term disability did not count toward full-time status, but other lawyers disagree.\n\nNew hires \u2014 that is, employees who have not worked through an entire measurement period \u2014 are treated differently. The company has to categorize a new hire at the outset. If it \u201creasonably expects\u201d \u2014 the I.R.S.\u2019s term \u2014 that the employee will work full time, it has to offer health insurance by the start of the employee\u2019s fourth month to avoid a potential penalty. Eventually, once new employees have worked through an entire measurement period, their status will be conditioned on the average number of hours they worked through that period.\n\nIf the company reasonably expects a new hire to be a variable hour, seasonal or part-time worker, it uses a special measurement and stability cycle at the beginning. It takes about two years for a new employee to sync up with the standard measurement and stability cycle that continuing employees use, said Linda Mendel, a benefits lawyer in Columbus, Ohio, but the company will have to offer the employee insurance before that.\n\nUnder the rules, Ms. Mendel said, a company is shielded from the mandate penalties until the first day of the new hire\u2019s 14th month. \u201cBut then you have to offer insurance on the first day of the 14th month,\u201d she said. The look-back method does give businesses with seasonal employees a break, because the yearlong measurement period will mean that the employees do not average out to full-time status. But deliberately misclassifying a new full-time hire as a variable-hour or seasonal employee could expose the company to additional penalties, lawyers said, depending on how vigorously the I.R.S. enforces the rules.\n\nGenerally speaking, an employer has to apply the same methods for determining full-time status across its work force. But the rules give the company some discretion to distinguish across broad categories of employees \u2014 between all salaried and hourly employees, between employees in different states, between union and nonunion workers, or among union workers. Based on these categories, the company may use either the monthly or look-back method, or use different measurement and stability periods.\n\nBut Ms. Mendel said that despite all its complications, the look-back method is only marginally more difficult to follow than the monthly measurement method, even for companies with stable work forces. \u201cNobody\u2019s using the monthly method,\u201d she said.", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20141124130017, "twitter": {"url": "http://boss.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/11/24/answering-the-hard-questions-on-the-a-c-a-which-employees-have-to-be-covered/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "description": "How can an employer know whether a worker with fluctuating hours will be entitled to insurance in advance of a given month?", "card": "summary", "title": "Answering the Hard Questions on the A.C.A.: Which Employees Must Be Covered?"}, "sourceApp": "blogs", "DISPLAYDATE": "November 24, 2014", "org": "Internal Revenue Service", "keywords": "Federal Taxes (US),Health Insurance and Managed Care,Paid Time Off,Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (2010),Small Business,Working Hours,Internal Revenue Service,The Agenda", "GBLC": "The Agenda", "communityAssetTaxonomy": "blogs/boss/Answering the Hard Questions on the A.C.A.: Which Employees Must Be Covered?
