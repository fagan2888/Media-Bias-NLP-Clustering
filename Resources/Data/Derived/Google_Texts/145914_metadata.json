Instead, the dry ones have been going to the Cool Fool Kite Festival at Veterans Park.\n\nKites go aloft starting at 11 a.m. Thursday, when the pros launch their stacks of kites. Look for the giant kites as well, like the popular octopus.\n\nSpectators are welcome to fly their kites until 5 p.m. Kites will be sold at the park, and hot chocolate, coffee and snacks are free while they last, as are parking and admission.\n\nVisitors also can get a lesson in ice carving or just watch the Quiet Ice Carvers at work, transforming blocks of ice into figures. Horse-drawn carriages will be available for rides around the park for a fee.\n\nThe festival is sponsored by Gift of Wings kite store, WLDB-FM (93.3), WLUM-FM (102.1) and WMCS-AM (1290), Bella Caffe and the Kite Society of Wisconsin and Illinois.\n\nFor more, go to the Gift of Wings website at giftofwings.com.\n\n\u2014 Carol Deptolla", "article_metadata": {"title": "Cool Fool Kite Festival soars at Veterans Park on New Year's Day", "og": {"url": "http://www.jsonline.com/news/cool-fool-kite-festival-soars-at-veterans-park-on-new-years-day-b99414987z1-286972271.html", "image": {"width": 1000, "identifier": "http://media.jrn.com/images/b99414987z.1_20141228183130_000_gcn9apbj.1-0.jpg", "height": 632}, "type": "article", "description": "Kites go aloft starting at 11 a.m. Thursday, when the pros launch their stacks of kites.
