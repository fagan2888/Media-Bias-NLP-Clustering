However, the new rule (with the purpose of protecting business owners such as himself) may force him to close his doors.\n\nRead more: 3D Printing & the Future of Manufacturing\n\n\u201cWe do not know what we are going to do regarding our factory\u2019s future in the U.S.,\u201d he explains. \u201cMy competitors are moving to outside of the country with labor rates low and property taxes being non-existent.\u201d\n\nThe company employs 17 salaried employees making about $32,000 a year. \u201cWe work over 200 people and growth this YTD is 27%, but we may be right at the end of being able to even stay open,\u201d explains the CEO.\n\nOne option, that many of his competitors have already taken, is to move operations out of the United States.\n\n\u201cWe just had one of our competitors open a new, modern plant in Juarez, Mexico,\u201d he explains. Others have been operating out of Mexico for years, but with small operations in the U.S. \u201cI really do not see how it is possible for us to not make the move to Mexico,\u201d he adds.\n\nThe move would mark the end of the company\u2019s American owned and operated business.\n\nAnother trend the CEO comments on is competitors using deceptive marketing by operating small plants in the U.S., but manufacturing elsewhere on the cheap. \u201cThey build thousands of a commodity product, stick in a container, and ship it to their plant in the U.S.,\u201d he explains. \u201cNow it appears it is being built in the U.S. It is all getting out of hand.\u201d\n\nThe CEO also adds that property taxes \u201care a killer.\u201d\n\nA hearing, \"Reviewing the Rules and Regulations Implementing Federal Wage and Hour Standards,\" which occurred on June 10, brought together many attendees expressing similar concerns, including those surrounding complicated regulations, more litigation, and limited workplace flexibility.\n\nDuring the meeting, the Subcommittee on Workforce Protections Chairman, Tim Walberg, explained, \u201cThanks to an administration notorious for overreaching and governing through executive fiat, I share many of those same concerns \u2026 it is my hope the department will heed these concerns and ultimately put forward a proposal that encourages \u2013 rather than stifles \u2013 productivity, personal opportunity, and economic growth.\u201d\n\nIt is estimated that the change would give between five and ten million workers a raise, and while it is hard to argue a fair days pay, who is going to pick up the tab?\n\nWhat are your thoughts? Will the new rule encourage productivity and economic growth, or stifle it?", "article_metadata": {"description": "In a recent blog post, A Hard Day\u2019s Work deserves a Fair Day\u2019s Pay, Obama explains his plans to extend overtime protection to nearly 5 million workers in 2016, covering all salaried workers making up to about $50,400 next year.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"site_name": "Manufacturing.net", "description": "In a recent blog post, A Hard Day\u2019s Work deserves a Fair Day\u2019s Pay, Obama explains his plans to extend overtime protection to nearly 5 million workers in 2016, covering all salaried workers making up to about $50,400 next year.", "title": "Can American Manufacturing Afford A Raise?", "url": "http://www.manufacturing.net/blog/2015/07/can-american-manufacturing-afford-raise", "updated_time": "2015-12-16T17:18:10-05:00", "type": "article"}, "google-site-verification": "TH1uH0gx_PIg04pXCeNJ51ii3DWReybgdihGDnKkNck", "article": {"published_time": "2015-07-06T16:57:56-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-12-16T17:18:10-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\u201cThat's good for workers who want fair pay, and it's good for business owners who are already paying their employees what they deserve,\u201d he says.\nAnother trend the CEO comments on is competitors using deceptive marketing by operating small plants in the U.S., but manufacturing elsewhere on the cheap.\n\u201cWe just had one of our competitors open a new, modern plant in Juarez, Mexico,\u201d he explains.\nThe move would mark the end of the company\u2019s American owned and operated business.\nHowever, the new rule (with the purpose of protecting business owners such as himself) may force him to close his doors."}
