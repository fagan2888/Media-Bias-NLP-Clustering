All Rights Reserved\n\nMeteorites hit the earth all the time. They are usually small and cause little damage. But in some cases the impact does not cause the crater you might expect. Here is what happens when a meteorite hits snow.When a meteorite hits land, a crater is formed. When meteorites hit snow, something called a \"snow carrot\" is formed. A funnel-shaped hole is formed in the wake of the falling space rock, which can be found laying at the bottom of it.There are two theories as how this happens. One theory says the meteorite is still warm when it hits the snow, causing snow particles to melt together before refreezing in the shape of a carrot. The other theory is that meteorites hit the snow with so much energy that they compact the snow hard enough to form the shape.\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-17", "Description": "Meteorites hit the earth all the time.
