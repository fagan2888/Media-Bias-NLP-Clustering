They fell to 11-1 in games decided by six points or less.\n\nThe Spartans (23-10) trailed by 16 points in the first half, went on a big run early in the second after coach Tom Izzo lit into his team at the break, and took control in the closing minutes.\n\nIzzo\u2019s team will try to make it two consecutive titles and three in four years when it takes on No. 6 Wisconsin on Sunday. The Badgers knocked off Purdue, 71-51, in the other semifinal.\n\n\u201cI think because we have so many great alums that really look at this month and they call from everywhere and they call our players, and our players, I think, somewhat feel a little obligated,\u201d said Izzo, who has led Michigan State to six Final Fours and one NCAA championship in 20 years. \u201cThat\u2019s not a bad thing, you know, to live up to the standards of the people that built the program.\u201d\n\nMelo Trimble led Maryland with 22 points, but hit just two of his last 11 shots. Dez Wells, who scored 10 points, was the only other player in double figures for the Terrapins (27-6), who had won eight in a row.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m proud of my team \u2014 27 wins now,\u201d coach Mark Turgeon said. \u201cWe\u2019re looking forward to what lies ahead.\u201d\n\nIt was 48-48 when Gavin Schilling hit a free throw and dunked to give Michigan State a three-point lead with 3:44 left. That started a decisive 9-2 spurt.\n\nDawson had a thunderous dunk before Lourawls Nairn Jr. hit one of two free throws to make it 57-50 with 1:31 remaining.\n\nAfter dropping two to Maryland in the regular season, Michigan State was down by 11 early in the second when it embarked upon a 15-0 run to go up, 40-36.\n\nMarvin Clark Jr. soared in for a left-handed dunk to make it a one-point game. Denzel Valentine nailed a 3-pointer from the right side after missing his first five shots to give Michigan State its first lead at 38-35.\n\nMatt Costello added a basket before Smotrycz hit a 3-pointer for Maryland, ending a 7:23 scoring drought.\n\n\u201cWe came out and played with more energy in the second half,\u201d Valentine said. \u201cWe came back against a great team.\u201d\n\nThe Spartans missed their first nine shots in the game, clanging open jumpers and point-blank layups. It was 12-1 before Trice hit a 3-pointer from the left corner with 14:37 left, and it wasn\u2019t like they were having much luck on the other end, either.\n\nTrimble got off to a blistering start for Maryland, hitting his first five shots and scoring 13 points as the Terrapins jumped out to a 23-7 lead. The Spartans went on a 9-0 run to pull within five with 4:30 left in the half, with Trice hitting a 3 from the left corner to make it 25-20 after Matt Costello grabbed an offensive rebound and passed to him.\n\n\u201cWe weren\u2019t getting back in transition,\u201d Trice said. \u201cA couple of [Trimble\u2019s] threes were walk-in, wide-open threes. As a scorer, any time you can see one or two go through easy, it kind of gets you rolling.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Trice scores 20 points as the Spartans rally to beat the eighth-ranked Terrapins, 62-58, snapping Maryland's eight-game winning streak.", "Author": "Andrew Seligman", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Trice scores 20 points as the Spartans rally to beat the eighth-ranked Terrapins, 62-58, snapping Maryland\u2019s eight-game winning streak.", "title": "Travis Trice, Michigan State overpower Maryland in Big Ten semifinals", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/mar/14/trice-has-20-points-michigan-state-tops-no-8-maryl/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/03/14/B10_Michigan_St_Maryland_Basketball.JPEG-02ba8.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/03/14/B10_Michigan_St_Maryland_Basketball.JPEG-02ba8.jpg", "title": "Travis Trice, Michigan State overpower Maryland in Big Ten semifinals", "description": "Trice scores 20 points as the Spartans rally to beat the eighth-ranked Terrapins, 62-58, snapping Maryland's eight-game winning streak.", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "news_keywords": "Sports, Travis Trice, Tom Izzo, Evan Smotrycz, Branden Dawson"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2c4e\"", "article_summary": "2 seed in the tournament, dropped this one after sweeping Michigan State during the regular season.\nDenzel Valentine nailed a 3-pointer from the right side after missing his first five shots to give Michigan State its first lead at 38-35.\nTravis Trice scored 20 points, Branden Dawson added 17 points and eight rebounds, and the Spartans rallied to beat the No.\nAfter dropping two to Maryland in the regular season, Michigan State was down by 11 early in the second when it embarked upon a 15-0 run to go up, 40-36.\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking forward to what lies ahead.\u201dIt was 48-48 when Gavin Schilling hit a free throw and dunked to give Michigan State a three-point lead with 3:44 left."}
