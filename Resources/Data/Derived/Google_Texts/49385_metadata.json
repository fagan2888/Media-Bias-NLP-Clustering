It was unfortunate, but even his peers in law enforcement privately agree it was the right thing to do.\n\nThe damage had been done, and not just to that car DeWitt\u2019s county truck rear-ended.\n\nFollowing his arrest, DeWitt at first said he would work to regain the public trust. But that was just pride talking. It\u2019s understandable. He was trying to hang on to a job he\u2019d held for 20 years, and had just won for another term.\n\nThen reality set in:\n\nHe had refused to take a breathalyzer test which, in South Carolina, is an automatic six-month suspension of your driver\u2019s license. Did he really think he could chase bad guys on a moped?\n\nAnd what would have happened if he tried to discipline a deputy for a similar offense if he\u2019d gotten away with his charges?\n\nFinally, there was no way he could ever again be the face of the county\u2019s \u201cSober or Slammer\u201d campaign, especially if he didn\u2019t go to the slammer.\n\nSome folks go through similar ordeals and manage to keep their job, so a few might argue there is a double standard for officers of the law.\n\nThey would be right.\n\nBut that\u2019s just the way it is.\n\nThe system\u2019s credibility\n\nIf it had only been a DUI, DeWitt\u2019s career might have survived.\n\nPoliticians \u2014 and the sheriff ultimately is one \u2014 muscle through similar charges often.\n\nSure, the MADD people would have kept on him, and some people would have been through with him, but others would recognize that could happen to anyone.\n\nOnce, anyway.\n\nBut DeWitt was not only driving under the influence, he fled the scene of his own accident involving an injury and refused to stop for blue lights.\n\nYou try that and see how it works out.\n\nAs an officer of the law, DeWitt had to know how serious an offense it is to run from the law.\n\nDashcams recorded the entire incident, and it was not a pretty scene. Folks might read over a police report, but they tend to remember videos \u2014 especially when they play like an episode of \u201cCops.\u201d And even though an officer on the scene was recorded saying that he bet this would be \u201cswept under the rug,\u201d that wasn\u2019t going to happen.\n\nNot with a free press, not with the Freedom of Information Act.\n\nThe entire Lowcountry was watching, and the courts could not afford to be lenient on the sheriff. DeWitt realized he would not get out of this lightly. A minimum sentence would have gotten maximum criticism.\n\nIt would have made a mockery of the entire system, a system DeWitt had upheld his entire career.\n\nTaking responsibility\n\nThe truth is, life is hard for officers of the law.\n\nStudies show that police officers have shorter life spans than civilians, their divorce rates are higher, as are their suicide rates. Police Quarterly says police use alcohol at about double the rate of other folks, and 20 percent of them abuse the drink.\n\nThat\u2019s not an excuse for DeWitt, not at all. Those are just the facts, ma\u2019am.\n\nThere are some who think if DeWitt had done things differently, he might have survived this. After all, Charleston County Sheriff Al Cannon weathered charges that he slapped a suspect in custody.\n\nCannon is a smart, thoughtful man, and he did the right thing. He immediately reported his actions to SLED, and stood for his punishment.\n\nOf course, many people didn\u2019t feel Cannon deserved any reprimand. He slapped a guy who had just driven 100 mph through Mount Pleasant and could have killed hundreds of people. Then smarted off about it.\n\nA lot of us would have done much worse to the guy than smack him.\n\nDeWitt was never going to get that kind of sympathy. Cannon was guilty only of taking his responsibility too seriously; DeWitt was ignoring his.\n\nFinally, Sheriff DeWitt realized that and is owning his mistakes.\n\nThis spring Berkeley County will elect DeWitt\u2019s replacement and the candidates need to look to the former sheriff\u2019s fate as a reminder of what they\u2019re getting into. Police work can take a toll on a person, and it\u2019s unforgiving.\n\nBut just because you enforce the law, that doesn\u2019t mean you are above it.\n\nIn the end, DeWitt recognized that.\n\nReach Brian Hicks at bhicks@postandcourier.com.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "It took a while, but Wayne DeWitt ultimately policed himself, Brian Hicks, \r\nBrian HicksFP LatestNews, \r\nMetro, \r\nMetro, Berkeley County,Wayne DeWitt", "og": {"site_name": "Post and Courier", "description": "Wayne DeWitt really didn\u2019t have a choice, and he knew that \u2014 it just took awhile for it to sink in.", "title": "It took a while, but Wayne DeWitt ultimately policed himself", "url": "http://www.postandcourier.com20150208/150209506/it-took-a-while-but-wayne-dewitt-ultimately-policed-himself", "image": {"url": "http://www.postandcourier.com/carbon/carbon-generic.png", "identifier": "http://www.postandcourier.com/carbon/carbon-generic.png"}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"app": {"country": "US", "name": {"ipad": "Post and Courier", "iphone": "Post and Courier", "googleplay": "Post and Courier"}, "id": {"ipad": 603721271, "iphone": 603721271, "googleplay": "com.Synapse.PandC"}}, "description": "Wayne DeWitt really didn\u2019t have a choice, and he knew that \u2014 it just took awhile for it to sink in.", "site": "@postandcourier", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "It took a while, but Wayne DeWitt ultimately policed himself"}, "metered": "yes", "p": {"domain_verify": "c6511264bdb6fa45c6bb985fb86d3ab2"}, "fb": {"app_id": 146078808769941}, "tout": {"article": {"id": 150209506}}, "keywords": "It took a while, but Wayne DeWitt ultimately policed himself , Brian Hicks, \r\nBrian HicksFP LatestNews, \r\nMetro, \r\nMetro, Berkeley County,Wayne DeWitt", "article": {"published_time": "2015-02-08T06:00:00Z", "modified_time": "2015-02-06T17:22:00Z", "author": "Brian Hicks"}, "msvalidate.01": "05BAEC9D8820FA9F10D57DB6EB3C6192", "google-site-verification": "rAW9DX7yfiFF82k05QGF6LbZBkxcKxMTzAwNv0OCKAM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "description": "Wayne DeWitt really didn\u2019t have a choice, and he knew that \u2014 it just took awhile for it to sink in."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd4a4\"", "article_summary": "Wayne DeWitt really didn\u2019t have a choice, and he knew that \u2014 it just took awhile for it to sink in.\nAs an officer of the law, DeWitt had to know how serious an offense it is to run from the law.\nLast week, the Berkeley County sheriff resigned more than a month after his arrest on DUI and hit-and-run charges.\nFinally, Sheriff DeWitt realized that and is owning his mistakes.\nAfter all, Charleston County Sheriff Al Cannon weathered charges that he slapped a suspect in custody."}
