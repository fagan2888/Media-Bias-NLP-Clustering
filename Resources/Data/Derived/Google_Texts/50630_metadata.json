It's often a time when people try to better themselves.\n\nFor Linda Annual and Jimmy Price, health is their main focus this year. They've found it is easier to keep your resolution if you have someone that is working towards the same goal.\n\n\"I'm coming to Bonita everyday that I can. I'm doing some walking, maybe a little jogging,\" says Annual.\n\n\"Same thing. I keep the weight off, year to year. I start it out every year and keep it all year long. I go to the fitness center and come out here and walk every day and watch what I eat,\" says Price.\n\nStaying healthy is one of the more popular resolutions many people try to stick with throughout the year, but for Russell Alderson it's about getting closer to God and raising his children in chirst.\n\n\"I'd like to keep them in church every time the doors are open because I believe it's important for these kids coming up nowadays in the shape this world is in. I just think it's a good thing to do for your kids,\" says Alderson.\n\nWhile Alderson and his family work on living more by the good book and growing their love for one another this year, one couple is getting ready to plan what is said to be the most important day of your life. Kaitlyn Hodgins and John Ivancic made it their new year's resolution to plan a stress-free wedding that can express their love for one another.\n\n\"It's been a lot of planning so far and it will continue to be a lot of planning with help from our family and friends. We just to kind of do what we like and make that reflect in a wedding and have really fun party for our friends,\" says Hodgins\n\nPeople may have different resolutions, but they are all working to make this year better than the last.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "video", "description": "With the new year comes new resolutions.
