It depends on audience, but I would like to go as leading man and not as negative actor.\u201d\n\nIn the filmdom, Rinzing enjoys a good bonding with his dad\u2019s co-star Jackie Shroff\u2019s son Tiger, who made his Bollywood debut with \u201cHeropanti\u201d.\n\n\u201cI am very close to Tiger\u2026I am working on my body right now and want to be in shape like Tiger. So off late, I have been into that. Besides, when an actor gets launched, definitely there will be criticism. I am learning from Tiger actually.\u201d\n\nRinzing would make his debut next year.\n\nHe is also \u201clearning dancing\u201d right now. \u201cNext year most likely I should make my debut, but lets see,\u201d he added.", "article_metadata": {"description": "It's time for Danny's son Rinzing to act on the big screen, but he is not keen to follow in his dad's footsteps.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Indian Express", "description": "It's time for Danny's son Rinzing to act on the big screen, but he is not keen to follow in his dad's footsteps.", "title": "Danny Denzongpa\u2019s son Rinzing wants to play lead roles", "url": "http://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/bollywood/danny-denzongpas-son-rinzing-wants-to-play-lead-roles/", "image": {"width": 209, "identifier": "http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/09/rinzing209.jpg?w=209", "type": "image/jpeg", "height": 116}, "updated_time": "September 7, 2014 4:33 pm", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "It's time for Danny's son Rinzing to act on the big screen, but he is not keen to follow in his dad's footsteps.", "title": "Danny Denzongpa\u2019s son Rinzing wants to play lead roles", "url": "http://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/bollywood/danny-denzongpas-son-rinzing-wants-to-play-lead-roles/", "image": {"width": 209, "identifier": "http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/09/rinzing209.jpg?w=209", "height": 116}, "site": "@IndianExpress", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "NOODP", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://indianexpress.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/efe0300e7f891c5c802ed340f6b20b67?s=16", "msapplication-tooltip": "Latest News, Breaking News Live, Current Headlines, India News Online", "msvalidate.01": "CCA9DA5B985004F4462DA743E776C636", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "application-name": "The Indian Express", "article": {"published_time": "September 7, 2014 4:33 pm", "modified_time": "September 7, 2014 4:33 pm"}, "keywords": ", danny denzongpa, danny denzongpa rinzing, danny denzongpa son, danny rinzing, tiger shroff", "google-site-verification": "4VKBquZoU-tYqmCYVAiCwBrBzbXCXZO15lCeN1tnv2M", "majestic-site-verification": "MJ12_ad7db024-a46c-482a-bb2f-e1ae09432a65", "news_keywords": "Danny Denzongpa, Rinzing, Hum, Danny Denzongpa son, Danny Rinzing, Danny Denzongpa Rinzing, Jackie Shroff, Tiger Shroff, Heropanti"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fccc6f\"", "article_summary": "It\u2019s time for Danny Denzongpa\u2019s son Rinzing to act on the big screen, but he is not keen to follow in his dad\u2019s footsteps and do negative roles.\nHe wants to be the leading man in his Bollywood movies.\nAsked if he would like to be like his father, who is known for his villainous roles in films like \u201cHum\u201d, Rinzing said: \u201cNo, I want to play the leading actor.\n\u201cI am very close to Tiger\u2026I am working on my body right now and want to be in shape like Tiger.\nI am learning from Tiger actually.\u201dRinzing would make his debut next year."}
