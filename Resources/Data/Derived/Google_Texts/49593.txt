A group of well-known veterans are tired of Hollywood’s depiction of them on the big screen — so they’re making their own movie.

Former Navy SEAL Marcus Luttrell and Medal of Honor recipients Dakota Meyer and Leroy Petry have joined forces for “Range 15,” a post-apocalyptic comedy spearheaded by two veteran-owned companies, Durham-based Ranger Up and Texas-based Article 15, that have raised almost $500,000 in 15 days.

“The more we raise, the better the movie becomes,” said Nick Palmisciano, CEO of Ranger Up, the Fayetteville Observer reported Monday. “This is not the movie that Hollywood would ever make. Nothing is sacrosanct. There’s nothing really like this.”

Mr. Luttrell posted a YouTube video on May 18 announcing his support for the project.

“My buddies over at Article 15 and Ranger Up are trying to make the most premier … gun-slinging, knife-wielding, cutting-your-head-off-and-putting-a grenade-in-it … movie ever made,” the former Navy SEAL said. “In order to do that we’re going to need a little bit more money because it takes a lot of money to get Navy SEALs to go anywhere with Rangers and Marines. Normally it’s the other way around — they’re rescuing us.

“But here’s the deal: we’re coming in to rescue this movie,” he said. “So we’re removing the bar. We want to try to earn as much money as humanly possible to make this thing as ‘Tombstone,’ ‘Big Trouble in Little China,’ ‘Band of Brothers,’ ‘Team America’ movie … smashed into one.”

The movie’s tagline: “The only thing scarier than the world ending is the team that’s trying to save it.”
