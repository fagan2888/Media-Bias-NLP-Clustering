Lots of people, at least up front near where journalists are sitting, appear to be leaving this rally now that Obama has started speaking. — Jeff Mason (@jeffmason1) October 19, 2014

Steady stream of people leaving Maryland rally continues as Obama speaks. It's noticeable and noisy. They would have waited hours to get in. — Jeff Mason (@jeffmason1) October 19, 2014

After waiting a long time for a POTUS speech, don't you want to hear the whole thing? And not just take a phone pic or two and then leave? — Jennifer Epstein (@jeneps) October 19, 2014

President Barack Obama made a rare appearance on the campaign trail on Sunday with a rally to support the Democratic candidate for governor in Maryland, but early departures of crowd members while he spoke underscored his continuing unpopularity. With approval levels hovering around record lows, Obama has spent most of his campaign-related efforts this year raising money for struggling Democrats, who risk losing control of the U.S. Senate in the Nov. 4 midterm election. Most candidates from his party have been wary of appearing with him during their election races because of his sagging popularity. Not so Lieutenant Governor Anthony Brown of Maryland, who is running for governor, and Governor Pat Quinn of Illinois, who is running for re-election….A steady stream of people walked out of the auditorium while he spoke, however, and a heckler interrupted his remarks.
