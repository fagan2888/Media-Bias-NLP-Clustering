Warren Buffett has refuted news reports stating he wants to "scrap" the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, and called such portrayals "outrageous."

He did so in a story published last week on omaha.com, which is the website of the Omaha World-Herald.

Buffett was reacting to recent new accounts which quoted comments he made in 2010 while the U.S. Senate was debating the bills that became the ACA. Buffett told the Omaha World-Herald that his comments were taken out of context.

“I've never suggested nor thought Obamacare should be scrapped,” Buffett told the World-Herald, which noted Buffett has supported Obama's political campaigns. “I support it. It relates to providing medical care for all Americans. That's something I've thought should be done for a long, long time."

Buffett is the second richest American, behind Bill Gates, according to Forbes Magazine.
