Oh, excuse me, I mean the Capitol. They went after us with death threats and targets and protests. You know what? Every time they tried to take us on, we stood up for what was right. We did what was right,\u201d said Walker.\n\nWalker told an enthusiastic group of supporters he\u2019s for reform, growth and safety.\n\n\u201cInstead of top down, government knows best approach, we hear from so many politicians in Washington, we should say instead we want to build the economy from the group up, in a way that\u2019s new and fresh and organic and dynamic,\u201d said Walker.\n\nWalker said he stands for getting rid of the Affordable Care Act, reigning in federal regulations and the approval of the Keystone Pipeline.\n\nHe would also push for more crippling sanctions against Iran, instead of accepting the nuclear agreement negotiated between the U.S. and Iran on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cGoing forward, if you give me a chance to be your president, as commander in chief I will move forward immediately in a way to terminate the bad deal with Iran right away,\u201d said Walker.\n\nWalker will spend the next three days in Iowa, making stops in 11 different cities.\n\nREAD IT: Governor Scott Walker\u2019s address, announcing his bid for president\n\nPlease enable Javascript to watch this video\n\nPlease enable Javascript to watch this video\n\nPlease enable Javascript to watch this video\n\nPlease enable Javascript to watch this video", "article_metadata": {"description": "IOWA -- Governor Walker was back in Iowa on Friday, July 17th\u00a0--\u00a0his first visit there since kicking off his presidential campaign on Monday, July 13th.
