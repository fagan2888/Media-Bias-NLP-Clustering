This hemostasis system was the first to market with PSI technology globally and is now available to Siemens\u2019 U.S. customers. The Sysmex CS-5100 System enables automated, standardized sample management as well as automated detection of unsuitable samples. The first analyzer in the Sysmex CS System portfolio of hemostasis solutions in the United States, this system is equipped with simultaneous multi-wavelength Preanalytical Sample Integrity checks, or PSI technology, enabling high-volume laboratories to achieve first-run accuracy.\n\nPreanalytical errors and unsuitable samples account for up to 70% of mistakes in laboratory diagnostics.1 For example, in coagulation testing, under-filling sample tubes may cause significant sample dilution and provide falsely prolonged clotting times.2 The effect of laboratory diagnostic errors on patient care is potentially significant, since information provided by clinical laboratories impacts up to 60\u201370% of clinical decisions.3\n\nLeveraging globally proven PSI technology, the Sysmex CS-5100 System enables laboratories to automate and standardize sample management and detect unsuitable samples prior to analysis. This enhances the reliability of results while improving efficiency by minimizing the need for manual sample inspections.\n\nTo date, the system has been well-received in laboratories outside the U.S. Dr. Lee-Ann Lambert of Brant Community Healthcare System (BCHS) in Brantford, Ontario, Canada, reports that the Sysmex CS-5100 System began paying dividends from the moment the analyzer went into service. According to Dr. Lambert, \u201cThe system validated itself right out of the gate\u201d by detecting insufficient volumes on its first day in the BCHS lab.\n\nThe Sysmex CS-5100 System also helps labs streamline workflows with its ability to connect to Siemens\u2019 automation and data-management offerings, including the flexible, track-based Aptio Automation and ADVIA LabCell automation solutions. Siemens is the only single-source provider of complete automation solutions in all four core laboratory disciplines: hemostasis, hematology, chemistry, and immunoassay.\n\n\u201cThis new technology provides a strong operational advantage to customers, as they no longer need to manually inspect patient samples to ensure the correct volume prior to analysis,\u201d said Franz Walt, President, Laboratory Diagnostics, Siemens Healthcare. \u201cAvailable both as a stand-alone or complete workflow solution with connectivity to automation, the Sysmex CS-5100 System has the flexibility to meet varying testing-volume requirements.\u201d\n\nThe Sysmex CS-5100 System also features third-generation cap-piercing technology, which contributes to reduced sample-processing time and maintains the analyzer\u2019s high-throughput capability. Further, greater efficiency is gained via a wide optical spectrum, which allows clotting, chromogenic, immunologic, and aggregation4 testing capabilities on a single platform. With onboard capacity of up to 3000 tests5 and up to 40 reagents, the Sysmex CS-5100 System delivers extended walkway time to streamline workflow.\n\n\u201cU.S. healthcare providers have experienced seismic shifts due to the implementation of the Affordable Care Act and reimbursement cuts. In response, laboratories must be more cost-effective in delivering timely, accurate results for a steadily increasing volume of patient tests,\u201d said Jack Kenny, Senior Vice President, Laboratory Diagnostics, Siemens Healthcare, North America. \u201cThe Sysmex CS-5100 System enables customers to confidently achieve higher throughput while improving accuracy.\u201d\n\nTo better ensure consistency of results and simplify testing in multisite labs, test results from the Sysmex CS-5100 System correlate with all other Sysmex CS and CA hemostasis systems. Additionally, the Sysmex CS-5100 System uses the same reagents, controls, and calibrators as other coagulation analyzers offered by Siemens.\n\nFor more information about the Sysmex CS-5100 System, please visit http://usa.healthcare.siemens.com/hemostasis/systems/sysmex-cs-5100-system.\n\n1.
