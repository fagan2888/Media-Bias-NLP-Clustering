Several fire crews from the surrounding areas, as well as OKC, have responded to the scene.\n\nFirefighters were also called out to the scene of a grass fire near 5100 N. Anderson Rd. in Spencer. One home in the area has caught fire because of the blaze.\n\nAround 2 p.m., another fire erupted near US 66 and Industrial Rd. east of Chandler. That fire spread and eventually led to OHP shutting down westbound Interstate 44 in the area, but not before a chain reaction pileup crash occurred on the highway likely due to smoke. EMSA was called to the scene. Traffic is moving slowly on the eastbound side of the turnpike.\n\nPerhaps the largest fire of the day, so far, started near the Payne County area, in between Stillwater and Glencoe. That fire was centered around County Road 3360 and Chimney Rd.\n\nA small grass fire also flared up near NE 36th St. and I-35 in OKC. Luckily crews were able to get a handle on this fire quickly.\n\nWinds gusting up to nearly 50 miles per hour in a southeasterly direction are making things difficult for firefighters.\n\nKeep checking with News 9 and News9.com for more information.", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-17", "Description": "Crews are working to get a handle on a grass fire that flared up just east of the metro, near Spencer, Monday afternoon.", "author": "Matthew Nuttle", "og": {"url": "http://www.news9.com/story/31168923/high-winds-fueling-grass-fires-around-the-metro", "image": "http://KWTV.images.worldnow.com/images/9832860_G.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Crews are working to get a handle on a grass fire that flared up just east of the metro, near Spencer, Monday afternoon.", "title": "High Winds Fueling Grass Fires Around The Metro"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://KWTV.images.worldnow.com/images/9832860_G.jpg", "description": "Crews are working to get a handle on a grass fire that flared up just east of the metro, near Spencer, Monday afternoon.", "card": "summary", "title": "High Winds Fueling Grass Fires Around The Metro"}, "wnreadableurl": "high-winds-fueling-grass-fires-around-the-metro", "ROBOTS": "index,follow,noarchive", "owner": "KWTV", "fb": {"app_id": 538140636230283}, "date": "2016/02/08", "KEYWORDS": "oklahoma city,okc,media,news,weather,tv,cbs,local,tornado,storm,oklahoma,newsok,channel 9,channel nine,news 9,television,this morning,live radar,kwtv,sports,video,live streaming,interactive,Grass Fire", "wn-version": "ContainerE-Story", "wn-base": "IIS22", "verify-v1": "d5ZN+GNiazjgWlnr3WHikwraMvFljdUSLMgex4CGnc8=", "news_keywords": "oklahoma city,okc,media,news,weather,tv,cbs,local,tornado,storm,oklahoma,newsok,channel 9,channel nine,news 9,television,this morning,live radar,kwtv,sports,video,live streaming,interactive,Grass Fire"}, "article_summary": "Perhaps the largest fire of the day, so far, started near the Payne County area, in between Stillwater and Glencoe.\nCrews are working to get a handle on a handful of grass fires flaring up around the metro, Monday afternoon.\nFirefighters were also called out to the scene of a grass fire near 5100 N.
