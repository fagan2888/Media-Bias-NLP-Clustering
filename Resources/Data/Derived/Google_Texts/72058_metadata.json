Jamelle Bouie reports from a pointless Capitol Hill demonstration.\n\n\u201cI want to be brutally honest with you about the fight to defund Obamacare,\u201d Texas Sen. Ted Cruz told a Tea Party crowd gathered outside of the Capitol. \u201cIf the traditional rules of Washington apply, we can\u2019t win. If the forum in which we have to make the case is a smoke-filled room, we\u2019ve lost.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut,\u201d he continued, \u201cI\u2019m convinced the model has changed. I\u2019m convinced that there is a new paradigm\u2014the grassroots\u2026No elected politician can win this fight.\u201d \u201cOnly you,\u201d he said, talking over the excited crowd, \u201ccan win this fight.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m not sure this is brutal honesty\u2014though, standing in the D.C. heat, surrounded by hundreds of people, it felt like it\u2014but it\u2019s honest enough. After 40 repeal votes in the House and endless hours of rhetoric against it, one thing is clear: congressional Republicans are powerless to stop the Affordable Care Act. There\u2019s no way a bill would reach Obama\u2019s desk, and if it did, there\u2019s no way he would sign it.\n\nTo wit, as a new clash over federal spending approaches on the Hill, GOP leaders are working to avoid a confrontation over Obamacare with a government funding proposal that makes repeal optional for the Senate. Under the proposal floated on Tuesday, the House would pass a continuing resolution to keep the nation running at sequester levels, along with an amendment to defund the health-care law, and pass the package to the Senate. The Senate can either approve the amendment or\u2014far more likely\u2014vote it down. But that\u2019s the extent of it. Either way, a resolution goes to the president, and everyone avoids a government shutdown. Absolutist conservatives are furious about this\u2014the right-wing Senate Conservatives Fund says House leaders have \u201cchickened out and decided to fund a program that will destroy our country\u201d\u2014but there\u2019s not much they can do about it. Obamacare is here to stay.\n\nWhich means that, for groups like the Tea Party Patriots, the Cruz demonstration\u2014billed as the \u201cExempt America\u201d rally\u2014was mostly show: An exercise in symbolism, aimed at Congress, the White House, and the millions of Americans who voted\u2014twice\u2014for President Obama and support the health-care law.\n\nBut the crowd was less enthusiastic than you\u2019d expect, especially given the hyperbole of activists and lawmakers like Michele Bachmann, who see this effort as nothing less than a fight for the soul of America. When Texas Rep. Louie Gohmert led the crowd in a call and response of anti-Obamacare myths\u2014\u201cDoes Obamacare prevent the free exercise of your religious beliefs? Does Obamacare fund abortions? Does Obamacare provide taxpayer-funded health care for illegals?\u201d\u2014the \u201cyesses\u201d were pro forma; more bored high school pep rally than fighters for liberty.\n\nIn fact, of the men and women I spoke to at the rally, most were hopeful that Congress would defund Obamacare, but none were willing to hold their breath. \u201cI\u2019m prepared to sell my property and my business in order to protect my livelihood,\u201d said Richie, an exterminator who came down from New Jersey to protest the law. \u201cI can understand helping people who really need it,\u201d he said, \u201cbut Obamacare is a huge intrusion. It\u2019s the confiscation of people\u2019s property.\u201d\n\nLinda, a housekeeper from Pittsburgh, was in the same boat\u2014she wants Congress to repeal Obamacare, but doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s going to happen. \u201cPoliticians on both sides are scoundrels,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m just here so I can tell my grandchildren I tried to do something about what\u2019s happening.\u201d\n\nJim, an out-of-work electrical engineer from St. Louis, isn\u2019t as hostile to politicians as a class, but he\u2019s also down on the prospects for opposition to Obamacare. \u201cI\u2019m not sure it will get defunded. I mean, the leadership isn\u2019t very supportive,\u201d he said. As for what he thinks will happen with the Affordable Care Act? \u201cI don\u2019t know. I guess we\u2019ll find out by October 1st,\u201d he said, referring to when the health-care exchanges\u2014where individuals can purchase insurance on a regulated market\u2014go \u201conline.\u201d\n\nAt the risk of sounding like a liberal clich\u00e9, I\u2019m struck by the circumstances of Richie, Linda, and Jim. If anything, Obamacare was designed with them in mind, people who\u2014because of their age or income\u2014have a hard time finding affordable health insurance. Indeed, I mentioned as much to Richie, who doesn\u2019t have health insurance\u2014he\u2019s a few years from eligibility for Medicare, a program he supports\u2014and relies on 24-hour clinics for his health care needs. \u201cI\u2019d rather pay for a mortgage than health insurance,\u201d he said, explaining his situation. When I said the law was meant for people like him, he dismissed the idea that government could help. \u201cWhen government funds things, they end up like the schools,\u201d he said. \u201cNot good.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s tempting to pull a What\u2019s the Matter with Kansas? and say that Richie is voting against his interests. But he\u2019s not. He wants a country that leaves people to their own devices, and only intervenes for the most vulnerable. Regardless of whether the Affordable Care Act is in his material interests, it doesn\u2019t fit his picture of America.\n\nBut, as most professional observers can tell you, Obamacare isn\u2019t going to confiscate anyone\u2019s property, and it isn\u2019t going to lead to a dystopia of poor care and high costs. In states where implementing the law is priority, it\u2019s working to lower costs on the individual market, and\u2014with subsidies and the Medicaid expansion\u2014is poised to help millions of uninsured Americans, including a good number of Republicans.\n\nWhat happens when these people discover the law isn\u2019t going to ruin their lives? What happens when it helps them? Will the GOP shift gears, and become a defender of the Obamacare status quo (\u201cGet your government hands off of my Medicare,\u201d and such)? Or will it be stuck in limbo, unable to attack the law\u2014for fear of alienating voters\u2014but forced to call for its repeal, to satisfy a still-active minority of anti-government zealots?", "article_metadata": {"twitter": {"site": "@thedailybeast", "card": "summary", "creator": "@jbouie"}, "keywords": "Ted Cruz, Health, u.s. poli", "publicationDate": 201309110845, "wrap": "/content/dailybeast/voxbox/jamelle-bouie", "news_keywords": "Ted Cruz, Health, US Politics", "pageNum": 1, "title": "Ted Cruz Is Powerless in the Face of Obamacare", "tags": "entity:person/ted_cruz,topic:lifestyle/health,topic:politics", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Beast", "description": "Congressional Republicans have come up with a plan that effectively admits they\u2019re powerless to kill it.", "title": "Ted Cruz Is Powerless in the Face of Obamacare", "url": "http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/09/11/ted-cruz-is-powerless-in-the-face-of-obamacare.html", "image": "http://cdn.thedailybeast.com/content/dailybeast/articles/2013/09/11/ted-cruz-is-powerless-in-the-face-of-obamacare/jcr:content/image.img.2000.jpg/1383229030940.cached.jpg", "type": "article"}, "environment": "dev", "platform": "desktop", "template": "article", "type": "house", "description": "Congressional Republicans have come up with a plan that effectively admits they\u2019re powerless to kill it.", "sectionTaxanomies": "health", "fb": {"admins": "1703087,30000737,1117577220,1276800108,931159,514915512", "app_id": 189930913679}, "authors": "Jamelle Bouie", "article": {"section": "politics", "published_time": "2013-09-11T08:45:00.000Z", "author": "http://www.thedailybeast.com/contributors/jamelle-bouiehtml"}, "resourceType": "dailybeast2/components/pages/article", "contentpath": "/content/dailybeast/articles/2013/09/11/ted-cruz-is-powerless-in-the-face-of-obamacare", "parsely-page": "{\"title\":\"Ted Cruz Is Powerless in the Face of Obamacare\",\"link\":\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/09/11/ted-cruz-is-powerless-in-the-face-of-obamacare.html\",\"image_url\":\"http://cdn.thedailybeast.com/content/dailybeast/articles/2013/09/11/ted-cruz-is-powerless-in-the-face-of-obamacare/jcr:content/image.crop.410.273.jpg/46107634.cached.jpg\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":\"/content/dailybeast/articles/2013/09/11/ted-cruz-is-powerless-in-the-face-of-obamacare\",\"pub_date\":\"2013-09-11T08:45:00+00:00\",\"section\":\"Health\",\"author\":\"Jamelle Bouie\",\"tags\":[\"ted_cruz\",\"health\",\"politics\"]}", "authorIds": "/etc/authors/j/jamelle-bouie", "content-type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fddbb7\"", "article_summary": "Does Obamacare provide taxpayer-funded health care for illegals?\u201d\u2014the \u201cyesses\u201d were pro forma; more bored high school pep rally than fighters for liberty.\nIt\u2019s the confiscation of people\u2019s property.\u201dLinda, a housekeeper from Pittsburgh, was in the same boat\u2014she wants Congress to repeal Obamacare, but doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s going to happen.\nWhat happens when these people discover the law isn\u2019t going to ruin their lives?\n\u201cI want to be brutally honest with you about the fight to defund Obamacare,\u201d Texas Sen.
