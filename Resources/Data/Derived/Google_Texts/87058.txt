Pima County Sheriff's deputies are investigating the death of a man with suspicious circumstances.

Deputies say they got a rescue follow-up call on Saturday, Dec. 19 in the 16400 block of Avenida del Oro. Upon their arrival, they found 72-year-old Robert

Behl dead with obvious signs of trauma.

One neighbor who did not want to be identified said Behl had been sick and in a lot of pain. He said he saw Behl yesterday and even asked him how he was doing. He said Behl only responded with a laugh.

Homicide detectives are involved with the investigation. An autopsy is being conducted and deputies hope to know more Monday.

Anyone with information on this incident is urged to call 911 or 88-CRIME.
