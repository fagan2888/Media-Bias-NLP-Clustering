Now Illinois and Pennsylvania are also seeking 2016 rate hikes in the range of 30 percent.\n\nThe Obama administration late Monday afternoon disclosed more state Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act health insurance exchanges are also requesting stunningly large average health insurance premium hikes, including Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Illinois asking for an average 29 percent spike and Highmark Health Insurance Co. of Pennsylvania asking for a 30 percent spike, according to the Wall Street Journal.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nThis grim news follows reporting that New Mexico\u2019s market leader ,Health Care Service Corp. is asking for an average premium spike of 51.6 percent. In addition, Tennessee\u2019s top insurer, BlueCross BlueShield of Tennessee wants an average spike of 36.3 percent; Maryland\u2019s market leader, CareFirst BlueCross BlueShield, requested an average spike of 30.4 percent; and Oregon\u2019s top insurer, Moda Health, is seeking a 25 percent spike.\n\nUnder Obamacare, insurers must file proposed premium rates with their local state regulator and the federal government by June for the following year beginning January 1. The 2015 rate requests ran to about three times of the 2 percent inflation rate, or 6 percent. At the time, insurance companies had only a little information about the health of the new customers they expected to sign up during the fall Obamacare expansion.\n\nBut now insurance companies across the nation are seeing their costs leap due to high utilization costs from people newly enrolled under Obamacare. Insurance companies demanding dramatically higher compensation are causing skyrocketing rates.\n\nThe steep rate requests are coming just 60 days after Democrats were ecstatic about a Robert Wood Johnson Foundation study that supposedly \u201cConfirms that Obamacare is Saving States Money.\u201d and a Kaiser Family Foundation study that reported similar findings for Connecticut, New Mexico, and Washington State. Researchers claimed Obamacare \u201cexpansion can produce savings in tax dollars and generate new revenue for state budgets.\u201d As an example, Kentucky was expected to save an estimated $820 million, and Arkansas was supposed to save $370 million, according to Think Progress.\n\nBut both the Johnson and Kaiser Foundation analysis now look preposterous. Obamacare was sold as reducing the cost of healthcare inflation to below the national inflation rate. But with the current inflation rate slightly negative and the average of the Obamacare state premiums spiking by 30 percent, the exploding cost burden of Obamacare may explain a big part of the recent economic slowdown.\n\nThe new requests for huge premium hikes come as the Democrats and Republicans are under both under high stress as they wait to see what the Supreme Court will decide in King v. Burwell, which could decimate the Left\u2019s biggest expansion of entitlements in 50 years. If the Supreme Court strikes down federal money for states that did not establish their own exchanges, 13 million people will lose about $120 billion in federal health insurance subsidies.\n\nIn the 2016 elections, the spectacular insurance premium increases should help Republicans that voted unanimously against Obamacare look smart. It may also serve as a dunce cap for Democrats that promised the law would \u201cCut the cost of a typical family\u2019s health insurance premium by up to $2,500 a year.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "MORE OBAMACARE INSURANCE PREMIUMS Spiking +30%", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "MORE OBAMACARE INSURANCE PREMIUMS Spiking +30%", "title": "MORE OBAMACARE INSURANCE PREMIUMS SPIKING +30%", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 4802, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/06/Health-Care-costs-David-Franklin-Getty.jpg", "height": 3590}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/06/02/more-obama-insurance-premiums-to-jump-30/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "MORE OBAMACARE INSURANCE PREMIUMS Spiking +30%", "title": "MORE OBAMACARE INSURANCE PREMIUMS SPIKING +30%", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/06/Health-Care-costs-David-Franklin-Getty.jpg", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true", "app_id": 1243316582352556}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "health care costs, insurance prices, obamacare, obamacare premiums,2016 Presidential Race, Big Government, Breitbart California,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "2016 Presidential Race", "tag": "obamacare premiums", "published_time": "2015-06-02T10:32:24-07:00", "categories": "Big Government,Breitbart California,2016 Presidential Race"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "But with the current inflation rate slightly negative and the average of the Obamacare state premiums spiking by 30 percent, the exploding cost burden of Obamacare may explain a big part of the recent economic slowdown.\nIn the 2016 elections, the spectacular insurance premium increases should help Republicans that voted unanimously against Obamacare look smart.\nIt may also serve as a dunce cap for Democrats that promised the law would \u201cCut the cost of a typical family\u2019s health insurance premium by up to $2,500 a year.\u201d\nThe 2015 rate requests ran to about three times of the 2 percent inflation rate, or 6 percent.\nObamacare was sold as reducing the cost of healthcare inflation to below the national inflation rate."}
