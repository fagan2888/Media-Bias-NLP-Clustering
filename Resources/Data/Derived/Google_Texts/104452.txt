Two-time Pulitzer Prize winning cartoonist Michael Ramirez had strong words for the Obama White House in an interview with the TheBlaze this week, calling it a “disaster” and raising the the specter of impeachment.

“If I had a message the the White House, the one word they seem to be unaware of. … Is the Constitution itself,” said Ramirez, senior editor and the editorial cartoonist for Investor’s Business Daily.

“This is a lawless administration,” he continued.

Pulitzer Winner’s Message to the Obama White House :

“Everything they have done has been a disaster,” he continued later in the interview. “Doing something over and over and expecting the same results is insanity. Its also called the Obama administration.”

“They’ve been a disaster from day one,” Ramirez added.

Ramirez spoke with TheBlaze in New York City on Tuesday.

His most recent book, “Give Me Liberty, or Give Me Obamacare,” is a collection of some of the award winning artist’s greatest hits and a chronicle of what he sees as the Obama administration’s greatest misdeeds.

Along with hundreds of colorful illustrations, the coffee-table style tome includes an introduction from Dick Cheney and an afterword from Rush Limbaugh.

It is available at fine bookstores everywhere and on Amazon.com.
