But insurance companies and individuals are also searching for less expensive health care, and they\u2019re taking some creative approaches.\n\nOne of these approaches is a new program called the Employers Centers of Excellence Network, which is being launched with large employers, including Walmart and Lowes.\n\nStarting in January, employees of those companies will be able to get knee and hip replacements for free at one of four hospitals around the country, because the network has already negotiated the price of all of the patients\u2019 care with the hospitals.\n\nIn fact, their travel, hospital costs and the costs for a family member to come with them as caretaker are all covered, as long as they go to one of the hospitals in the system, instead of their own.\n\nThe process of negotiating costs for all steps of a procedure is called \u201cbundled payments,\u201d and under the Affordable Care Act, Medicare did some experiments with it.\n\nBut does it actually save the customer money? And what happens when, during your procedure, additional care is needed that wasn\u2019t part of the package negotiated with the hospital?\n\nHere & Now\u2019s Robin Young speaks to David Lansky, president and CEO of the Pacific Business Group on Health, which operates the Employers Centers of Excellence Network. He says the first consideration when constructing the network wasn\u2019t actually the cost of the care, but outcome.\n\n\u201cYou save a lot of money \u2014 not on the initial cost of the operation, but not having to go back to the hospital over and over again for adjustments,\u201d he says.\n\nRobin Young also speaks with Matt Barry, senior health care analyst at Bloomberg Government, about the logistics behind bundling, and whether or not it makes sense for people to use.\n\nGuest", "article_metadata": {"description": "Insurance companies and individuals are searching for less expensive health care, and they're taking some creative approaches, including something called bundled payments.", "application-name": "WBUR: Here and Now", "og": {"site_name": "hereandnow", "description": "Insurance companies and individuals are searching for less expensive health care, and they're taking some creative approaches, including something called bundled payments.", "title": "Companies Look To \u2018Bundled Payments\u2019 To Lower Health Care Costs", "url": "http://hereandnow.wbur.org/2013/11/13/bundled-health-care", "image": "http://s3.amazonaws.com/media.wbur.org/wordpress/11/files/2013/09/0925_stethoscope-money-624x391.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://hereandnow.wbur.org/2013/11/13/bundled-health-care", "image": "//s3.amazonaws.com/media.wbur.org/wordpress/11/files/2013/09/0925_stethoscope-money-624x391.jpg", "site": "@HereAndNow", "card": "summary", "title": "Companies Look To 'Bundled Payments' To Lower Health Care Costs"}, "DC.date.issued": "2013-11-13", "fb": {"admins": 1549080028, "app_id": 134067973330252}, "msvalidate.01": "D02D46BAEDB3F81FC1B1DE2A8CB69551"}, "article_summary": "But insurance companies and individuals are also searching for less expensive health care, and they\u2019re taking some creative approaches.\nHe says the first consideration when constructing the network wasn\u2019t actually the cost of the care, but outcome.\nRobin Young also speaks with Matt Barry, senior health care analyst at Bloomberg Government, about the logistics behind bundling, and whether or not it makes sense for people to use.\nThe process of negotiating costs for all steps of a procedure is called \u201cbundled payments,\u201d and under the Affordable Care Act, Medicare did some experiments with it.\nHere & Now\u2019s Robin Young speaks to David Lansky, president and CEO of the Pacific Business Group on Health, which operates the Employers Centers of Excellence Network."}
