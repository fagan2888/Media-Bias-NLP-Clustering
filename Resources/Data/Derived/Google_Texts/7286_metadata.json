Ray Ward said HB302 would extend coverage to an estimated 50,000 individuals and would be funded through two taxes \u2013 one on hospitals and the other on e-cigarettes.\n\n\u201cGetting people coverage is very important. Bad things happen to people when they don't have access to basic health care,\u201d Ward said, pointing to financial calamities people encounter when they get so sick they end up in the hospital.\n\nA family physician by profession, Ward also decried the challenges which befall people when they can't routinely see a doctor.\n\n\u201cThings go wrong when they don't get treated and then they have terrible complications later, or their mental illness goes untreated so they can't take care of their children,\u201d Ward said. \u201cOr, their substance abuse doesn't get treated so they're back in jail.\u201d\n\nRELATED: Medicaid gap: Hitting people at home in Ogden\n\nHis bill is similar to the hotly disputed Healthy Utah plan backed by Gov. Gary Herbert in 2015.\n\nThe hospital assessment is structured so those facilities come out ahead financially, Ward said.\n\n\u201cThere's the $25 million assessment, but they'll make $50 million if we do this. So they're willing partners in this process,\u201d Ward said, reasoning that hospitals already have to take care of the uninsured by law, and those costs often are written off as bad debt or get passed on to the broader patient pool in terms of higher costs.\n\n\u201cIf this were to go through, they'd still be caring for the same people and they'd be making $50 million more,\u201d Ward said. \u201cThis would tax them $25 million of those dollars but they'd keep $25 million without doing any extra work.\u201d\n\nThe levy on e-cigarettes would tax those products at the same rate as tobacco products, Ward said, noting that vaping among Utah teens has doubled in the past five years.\n\nUnder the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA), the federal government currently pays more than 90 percent of the cost of Medicaid expansion. By 2021, that federal match will decrease to 90 percent and remain there until Congress decides to change the law, Ward said.\n\nSo the state is on the hook for 10 percent of the cost, but many lawmakers previously voiced mistrust about how long the feds would hold up their end of the deal and voted against Medicaid expansion last year.\n\nReached Tuesday, Aaron Frazier, executive director of the Utah Smoke-Free Association, spoke against the e-cigarette tax Ward has in mind. Frazier's organization represents many of the smaller mom-and-pop vaping shops in Utah.\n\n\u201cWe are fully opposed to (Ward's) bill and any attempt to tax the (vaping) industry. We see this as yet another regressive tax which is not good for consumers. It picks on a certain economic status which we don't feel is good business for the state,\u201d Frazier said.\n\nAbout 800 people in Utah are employed by the e-cigarette industry, and a tax would directly impact their jobs, Frazier said.\n\n\u201cAny taxation of this type of product would have a devastating impact on small business owners. We've seen it happen throughout the country and it forces those businesses to shut down because they're unable to compete in the global market on the Internet,\u201d Frazier said.\n\nFrazier cited a Washington D.C. e-cigarette tax similar to what Ward is proposing.\n\n\u201cWithin six months, over half of the retail operations had to close their doors, file bankruptcy or move out of the area,\u201d Frazier said.\n\nGreg Bell, president of the Utah Hospital Association, said Ward had not yet contacted his organization about HB302.\n\n\u201cWe've been roughly aware his bill is out there,\u201d Bell said, noting that Rep. Jim Dunnigan, R-Taylorsville, also has a Medicaid measure that the Association prefers. Dunnigan's measure is still unnumbered, but Bell said Dunnigan had contacted them about its details.\n\n\u201cHe would want to pay hospitals traditional insurance rates \u2013 which are higher than Medicaid rates \u2013 therefore he'd want us to pay a share,\u201d Bell said. \u201cI don't understand Ward's plan yet, we haven't discussed it and are not aware of what it is.\u201d\n\nIn 2015, the Utah Hospital Association lobbied for Gov. Herbert's Healthy Utah plan. The resulting Medicaid battle proved exhausting.\n\nRELATED: Health advocacy organizations make 'PUSH' for Utah's uninsured\n\n\u201cEverybody gave up after last year's bills.They all have fatigue,\u201d Bell said. \u201cLast year we went whole hog to try to get Healthy Utah adopted. This year all we've done is answer the phone. Jim Dunnigan has called us to see what we think.\u201d\n\nSen. Gene Davis, D-Salt Lake City is also sponsoring a streamlined Medicaid expansion bill, SB77, that would expand Medicaid eligibility in compliance with the PPACA that many call Obamacare.\n\nWard expects all three measures to be scheduled for committee discussions around the same time.\n\n\u201cI'll be supportive of any bill that gets more coverage to more people, but the ultimate goal ought to be basic coverage for everybody below the poverty level,\u201d Ward said. \u201cI don't mean for it to be 'Cadillac' treatment, I don't mean for it to be fancy, but just basic coverage ought to be available to people.\u201d\n\nWhat is the federal poverty level?\n\nFederal poverty level is a measure of income issued annually by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nFederal poverty levels are used to determine eligibility for certain programs and benefits. These are the FPL amounts currently used by the Marketplace for 2016:\n\n$11,880 for individuals\n\n$16,020 for a family of 2\n\n$20,160 for a family of 3\n\n$24,300 for a family of 4\n\n$28,440 for a family of 5\n\n$32,580 for a family of 6\n\n$36,730 for a family of 7\n\n$40,890 for a family of 8\n\nContact reporter Cathy McKitrick at 801-625-4214 or cmckitrick@standard.net.
