Ruff made the comments during an appearance at Danville Pittsylvania County Chamber of Commerce . At the time, Ruff was arguing\n\nSEE ALSO: 4-Year-Old Health Care Law Is Still A \u201cBig F\u2014\u2013g Deal\u201d\n\nOn the use of \u201ctar baby,\u201d the Virginia Pilot notes:\n\nRuff reputedly compared reliance on promised funds to provide health insurance for thousands of low-income Virginians to a \u201ctar baby.\u201d He said doing so would leave the state unable to later detach itself from the program if its terms become unfavorable for Virginia, several people at the meeting claimed.\n\nAnd not long after, he gave the typical \u201cI wasn\u2019t being racist by using this racist term\u201d retort:\n\nIn a brief telephone interview Wednesday morning, state Sen. Frank Ruff said he \u201cmeant nothing racial\u2026at all\u201d by using the term \u201ctar baby\u201d during a health care policy discussion this week. Ruff, a Mecklenburg County Republican, told the Virginian-Pilot that he perceives the phrase to mean \u201ca sticky situation\u201d and nothing more. But the senator said he is aware his use of the metaphor caused offense \u2014 Ruff said he called Danville Mayor Sherman Saunders, who is African American and was present for the remark Tuesday, and left a message of apology.\n\nRuff is a 64-year-old man from Virginia. I have a hard time believing he doesn\u2019t know a little bit of the history behind the term \u201ctar baby.\u201d And even if he didn\u2019t \u2014 which again, I highly doubt \u2014 why would you use that to describe a \u201csticky situation\u201d instead of, oh, I don\u2019t know, the term \u201csticky situation\u201d itself. Better yet, how about all of these Republicans stop using hyperbole when discussing the Affordable Health Care Act altogether?\n\nFrank Ruff, you can fall through the biggest trap door of life and fall face first right in to a tar pit. You and all of your other racist cohorts in the GOP.\n\nHere are other examples of Republicans pretending not to know what their use of \u201ctar baby\u201d really means (via The Huffington Post:\n\nBack in 2006, then-White House Press Secretary Tony Snow deflected a question about the government collecting phone records, saying he didn\u2019t \u201cwant to hug the tar baby of trying to comment on the program.\u201d During the same year, then-Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney (R) apologized for using the term to describe a troubled Boston highway tunnel project.\n\nRuff knew what he was doing when he said it, only these days it\u2019s a lot harder for your ilk to get away with just throwing out racially charged language without even a nominal level of repercussions. As a southern boy, I prefer my racism delivered straight, no chaser.\n\nSo don\u2019t invoke \u201ctar baby\u201d in an argument against policy pushed by a Black man and then cower when called on it. Own your bigotry. It\u2019s the least you could do. Speaking of bigots who owned their hatred, Fred Phelps died. In honor of his life, everyone go have gay sex in his memory. And if you want to include the Frank Ruffs of the world in your celebration, do it with a Black person.\n\nUntil the next racist, y\u2019all.\n\nMichael Arceneaux blogs at thecynicalones.com, tweets at @youngsinick, and praises Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s name everywhere he goes.\n\nAlso On News One:", "article_metadata": {"pubexchange": {"headline": "Va.
