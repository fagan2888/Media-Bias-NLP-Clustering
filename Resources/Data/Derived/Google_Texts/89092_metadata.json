Jan Brewer said at a press conference: \"We believe in the rule of law, and dang it, the federal government has got a job to do.\"\n\nWhat's the Reality?\n\nIn fact, desperate Central American parents are exploiting separate legal loopholes in American border security passed before Obama took office.\n\nUnaccompanied minors fall under the bipartisan law, William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008, which passed the House and Senate unanimously and was signed into law by President George W. Bush.\n\nThat law says the children cannot be sent back. They must instead be held humanely by the Department of Health and Human Services until the courts release them to a \"suitable family member\" in this country.\n\nThe child \"shall be promptly placed in the least restrictive setting that is in the best interest of the child,\" the law stipulates. \"Placement of child trafficking victims may include placement in an Unaccompanied Refugee Minor program \u2026 if a suitable family member is not available to provide care.\"\n\nDepartment of Homeland Security (DHS) sources say more than 80 percent of these children will find permanent homes in the U.S., with either family or foster homes and not be sent back to Central America.\n\nMeanwhile, there is no place to house those mothers flooding the border with their children, as Thomas Homan, executive associate director of ICE for Enforcement and Removal Operations, told a House committee last week.\n\n\"I have 96 beds - 96 family beds is all I have,\" Homan said.\n\nInstead, the Customs and Border Protection (CPB) ends up dropping them at the local bus station to safely join relatives here across the country.\n\nThey must promise to appear in immigration court, but no one will say how many ever do. DHS announced last week it is rapidly expanding facilities, opening a 700-bed facility in New Mexico, but until then these are empty threats.\n\nAs the president himself told ABC'S George Stephanopoulos in an exclusive interview, he has no choice.\n\n\"We have to house these kids and take care of them until the machinery, under current law, allows us to send them back,\" President Obama said Thursday.\n\nAnd now President Obama is requesting about $2 billion in emergency funding from Congress to help deal with the crisis, along with expanded power for DHS to fast-track deportations. The White House says it plans to send a detailed letter to Congress following the July 4 recess.\n\nThe president will also ask for tougher penalties for smugglers who bring children across the border. Current law applies to traffickers but not those smuggling willing individuals across the border.\n\nJust last week, Arizona Senators John McCain and Jeff Flake introduced legislation in the Senate that would increase penalties for smugglers to 20 years in prison.\n\nDHS Secretary Jeh Johnson has said: \"It is not safe to send your child on the over 1,000 mile journey into Mexico, into south Texas if you're a parent considering doing this. DACA is not available for your child.\"\n\nCentral America Violence\n\nObama and his administration, meanwhile, say the violence in the Central American countries is to blame for the mass influx.\n\nA travel warning put out this week by the State Department said that \"since 2010, Honduras has had the highest murder rate in the world,\" citing the homicide rate of 75.6 per 100,000 people in 2013.\n\nA march 2014 UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) report found that of 404 unaccompanied children they spoke to who entered the U.S. during or after October 2011, 58 percent \"were forcibly displaced because they suffered or faced harms that indicated a potential or actual need for international protection.\"\n\nWhile the United States received around 85 percent of all applications for asylum, the UNHCR report also found a 435 percent increase in asylum requests from El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras in other countries - Mexico, Panama, Nicaragua, Costa Rica and Belize.\n\nThis isn't a new trend. CBP has seen an effective doubling in apprehensions of unaccompanied minors from El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras for the past few years - even before DACA. The number jumped from just over 4,000 in 2011, to almost 10,500 in 2012, and 26,000 in 2013. This year the current number stands at 39,000 for the same three countries.\n\nLike \"This Week\" on Facebook here .
