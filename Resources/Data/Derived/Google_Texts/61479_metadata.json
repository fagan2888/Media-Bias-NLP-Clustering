But she failed to rattle a poised Greg Abbott.\n\nThe Democrat, trailing in polls and wanting to pump energy into her campaign, used the debate as a high-stakes gambit to paint the Republican attorney general as being for big-money contributors. She addressed him directly, accusing him in a measured voice and a frequent smile, while painting herself as a champion for the less advantaged, particularly on education.\n\n\u201cThe [funding] cuts that you\u2019re defending that have left our classrooms overcrowded, that have left our teachers laid off \u2014 that\u2019s not liberal, that\u2019s not conservative, that\u2019s just dumb,\u201d said Davis, a state senator from Fort Worth.\n\nAbbott said that he wants to move Texas schools beyond an outdated, \u201cone-size-fits-all\u201d funding method and make Texas first in the nation, especially in concentrating on younger students.\n\nSaying Texas has excelled in the areas of energy, job creation and exports, Abbott added that \u201cthe time has come to set a new aspiration: Texas should be No. 1 in the nation for educating our children.\u201d\n\nWith rapid-fire questions, it was Friday Night Lights-out for the first of two debates between contenders for governor, with this one set in the Rio Grande Valley. Though border security and immigration dominated, the candidates also touched on issues ranging from abortion to Medicaid and the minimum wage, displaying a number of policy differences.\n\nAbbott rarely spoke directly to Davis, instead looking at the camera or moderators and promoting his vision of a low-tax and limited government that can still improve on education, roads and creating jobs. The only Democrat he criticized directly and frequently was President Barack Obama.\n\nAt one point he asked Davis if she were still glad she had voted for the president, whose deep unpopularity in the state is a headache for Democrats. Davis laughed at the question but didn\u2019t answer it, instead talking about what she wants to do as governor.\n\nDavis focused on the $5.4 billion in cuts pushed through the Republican-dominated Legislature during the 2009 budget shortfall.\n\nThe cuts led more than 500 school districts to sue the state. An Austin district judge ruled that the state is violating the Texas Constitution by failing to provide adequate or equitable funding. Abbott, as attorney general, has represented the state and has said he will appeal the ruling. The state Supreme Court is expected to ultimately resolve the case next year.\n\nAnd while both said more should be done for prekindergarten classes, their programs disagree on the scope. Abbott has said he wanted to focus on the children who would most benefit from a pre-K program, while Davis wants the early education extended to all children, which would come at a higher cost.\n\nBut she used the issue to hammer Abbott \u2014 who has raised more than $30 million for the campaign \u2014 on her claims that he is too close to moneyed interests.\n\nDavis accused Abbott of \u201cpicking and choosing\u201d the children who would benefit by using standardized tests for 4-year-olds to enter the program.\n\nThe only way children might be able to get out from under the mandate, she said, \u201cis to hire a lobbyist, form a [political action committee] and donate to Greg Abbott campaign, because that\u2019s how he works,\u201d Davis said.\n\nAbbott disputes that his plan calls for testing children so young. He has criticized Davis for raising much of the tens of millions for her campaign from out-of-state liberals.\n\nOn abortion \u2014 the issue that propelled Davis to national prominence during a 13-hour filibuster last year against an abortion restrictions bill \u2014 Abbott said he is a pro-life Catholic who believes in developing a culture of life in Texas.\n\nThe Republican referred to one of the elements in the bill Davis fought, which prohibits abortions after 20 weeks.\n\n\u201cTexas is ensuring that we protect more life and do a better job of protecting the health care of women by providing that women still have five months to make a very difficult decision. But after that time, the state has an interest in protecting innocent life,\u201d Abbott said.\n\nDavis called abortion the \u201cmost private of decisions [that] can be made by women.\u201d She noted that Abbott opposes abortion rights even in cases of rape and incest.\n\n\u201cMr. Abbott, that is not protecting women. On behalf of Texas women, I say, \u2018No thank you,\u2019 \u201d Davis said.\n\nShe also pointed to Abbott having invited rocker and gun advocate Ted Nugent to appear on the campaign trail with him, saying Nugent \u201cis a known sexual predator who bragged about having sex with underaged girls.\u201d\n\nAbbott condemned the Affordable Care Act as a failure, while Davis said her opponent was proving to be \u201cCalifornia\u2019s best friend\u201d by sending Texas money to other states that have extended Medicaid under the act.\n\nMany of the questions focused on South Texas and top concerns for Hispanic voters. Davis accused Abbott of working against Hispanics on redistricting plans that judges have said intentionally discriminate against Hispanic communities. She said the state law requiring photo ID to vote, which Abbott defended, would disenfranchise minorities.\n\nAbbott said he wanted to protect the Rio Grande Valley from drug traffickers. Texas Republicans have offered up tough rhetoric on immigration that has chafed many Hispanics, but Abbott said he wants to set a new tone. He pointed out that his wife of 33 years, Cecilia, would be the first Hispanic first lady of Texas should he become governor.\n\nDespite their differences, there were areas where the candidates also managed to agree. They both said they supported the death penalty, the surge of National Guard troops along the border and drug testing for recipients of state benefits.\n\nWhile Abbott blamed Obama for failing to secure the border, Davis joined the chorus, saying several times that if the federal government failed to do its job, then the state should step in.\n\nOn Twitter:\n\n@christyhoppe", "article_metadata": {"description": "Wendy Davis was the aggressor in the debate, but Greg Abbott kept his cool and avoided mistakes.", "og": {"description": "Wendy Davis was the aggressor in the debate, but Greg Abbott kept his cool and avoided mistakes.", "title": "Davis, Abbott stage Rio Grande Valley battle over schools, border", "url": "http://www.dallasnews.com/news/politics/state-politics/20140919-davis-abbott-stage-rio-grande-valley-battle-over-schools-border.ece", "image": {"width": 595, "identifier": "http://www.dallasnews.com/news/politics/state-politics/20140919-wendy_davis.jpg.ece/BINARY/original/wendy_davis.jpg", "height": 670}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "type": "article"}, "LastModifiedDate": "2014-09-20T05:56:34Z", "twitter": {"site": "@dallasnews", "card": "summary", "creator": "@dallasnews"}, "PublishDate": "2014-09-20T04:06:43Z", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Davis, Abbott stage Rio Grande Valley battle over schools, border\", \"link\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/news/politics/state-politics/20140919-davis-abbott-stage-rio-grande-valley-battle-over-schools-border.ece\", \"image_url\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/news/politics/state-politics/20140919-jump_meeting_.jpg.ece/BINARY/original/JUMP_meeting_.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"1930242\", \"pub_date\": \"2014-09-20T04:06:43Z\", \"section\": \"State Politics\", \"author\": \"CHRISTY HOPPE\", \"tags\": [\"dallas\", \"dallas fort worth\", \"dallas news\", \"dallas fort worth news\", \"dfw news\", \"dallas local news\", \"dallas fort worth local news\", \"dallas newspaper\", \"dallas morning news\", \"dallas morning news newspaper\"]}", "fb": {"admins": 1043783589, "page_id": 20946638799, "app_id": 258290334265148}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"image": "http://www.dallasnews.com/news/politics/state-politics/20140919-jump_meeting_.jpg.ece/ALTERNATES/w660/JUMP_meeting_.jpg", "publishtime": "2014-09-20T04:06:43Z"}}, "news_keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce65e\"", "article_summary": "Davis accused Abbott of working against Hispanics on redistricting plans that judges have said intentionally discriminate against Hispanic communities.\nOn behalf of Texas women, I say, \u2018No thank you,\u2019 \u201d Davis said.\nDavis accused Abbott of \u201cpicking and choosing\u201d the children who would benefit by using standardized tests for 4-year-olds to enter the program.\nAbbott said he wanted to protect the Rio Grande Valley from drug traffickers.\nAbbott said that he wants to move Texas schools beyond an outdated, \u201cone-size-fits-all\u201d funding method and make Texas first in the nation, especially in concentrating on younger students."}
