But as the 59-year-old Microsoft founder and philanthropist recently told Vox, that just isn\u2019t the case.\n\n\u201cWe've created, in terms of spread, the most dangerous environment that we've ever had in the history of mankind,\u201d Gates said.\n\nThat isn\u2019t because humans are more violent than before \u2014 we\u2019re actually at our most peaceful, argues Harvard cognitive scientist Steven Pinker \u2014 or because our crops are genetically modified and our livestock survive on antibiotic-laced feed. Gates\u2019 vision of our downfall is far more zoomed-in than that. Bill Gates says 33 million people could die within a year due to infectious disease.\n\n\u201cI rate the chance of a nuclear war within my lifetime as being fairly low,\u201d he said. Lumped into that pot of unlikely events: death by volcanic eruptions, enormous earthquakes, and the kind of asteroids that offed the dinosaurs. However, \u201cI rate the chance of a widespread epidemic, far worse than Ebola, in my lifetime, as well over 50 percent.\u201d\n\n\u201cFar worse than Ebola\u201d isn\u2019t hyperbole. Given our planet\u2019s history with pandemic disease outbreaks, including the Spanish flu from the early 20th century, H1N1 in 2009, and the recent cases of bird flu, which to date have spurred the mass slaughter of 39 million birds, Gates says his models predict a scenario in which tiny microbial invaders could feasibly wipe out 33 million people in just 250 days.\n\nIt isn\u2019t just virulence that threatens humans\u2019 safety. As last year\u2019s Ebola outbreak demonstrated, the world simply isn\u2019t prepared to contain an outbreak of that magnitude. The death toll from the virus between 2014 and 2015 was 10 times higher than every past Ebola outbreak combined.\n\nMore terrifying, Ebola\u2019s reproduction number \u2014 a measure epidemiologists use to determine how many people an infected person will go on to infect \u2014 is on the low side. It\u2019s just two. SARS, meanwhile, had a reproduction number of four and measles was a staggering 18. The fact Ebola managed to kill so many with such a middling reproduction number gives people like Gates cause for concern, especially since many diseases spread long before scientists have their finger on the pulse.\n\n\u201cIf you look at the H1N1 flu in 2009,\u201d Ron Klain, the so-called \u201cEbola Czar\u201d who coordinated America\u2019s response to the viral outbreak, told Vox, \u201cit had spread around the world before we even knew it existed.\u201d The same happened with the Spanish flu back in 1918. The virus didn\u2019t come from Spain. Scientists don\u2019t know where it came from \u2014 they only named it after the country because that\u2019s where news of the outbreak first broke.\n\nIn reality, our progress as a species may be what\u2019s spelling our downfall. Rates of immune-related disorders, such as asthma and allergies, are significantly higher in Western countries where there is an emphasis on cleanliness and sterility. This theory is known as the \u201chygiene hypothesis,\u201d and it is gaining salience particularly as the conditions falling under its umbrella increase in prevalence. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention finds allergies have been increasing steadily since the 1980s.\n\nTurning these trends around requires a dedicated focus to improving the care given in a nation\u2019s hospitals, where quarantines are taken seriously. But that demands the coordination from many moving parts, something the Ebola outbreak showed the U.S. lacked abundantly. Our technology is advancing considerably year over year. Without a way to use it effectively, it becomes useless, so humans become helpless.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "bill, gates, fears, massive, infectious, disease, epidemic, looming, his, lifetime", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "In under a year, infectious disease could theoretically wipe out 33 million people, more than the entire population of Peru.", "title": "Bill Gates Fears A Massive Disease Epidemic Is Looming  [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/bill-gates-fears-massive-infectious-disease-epidemic-looming-his-lifetime-335450", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/05/28/bill-gates.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "In under a year, infectious disease could theoretically wipe out 33 million people, more than the entire population of Peru.", "title": "Bill Gates Fears A Massive Disease Epidemic Is Looming  [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/bill-gates-fears-massive-infectious-disease-epidemic-looming-his-lifetime-335450", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/05/28/bill-gates.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/05/28/bill-gates.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-05-28T15:05:22-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-05-28T15:05:21-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "In under a year, infectious disease could theoretically wipe out 33 million people, more than the entire population of Peru."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca80d\"", "article_summary": "However, \u201cI rate the chance of a widespread epidemic, far worse than Ebola, in my lifetime, as well over 50 percent.\u201d\u201cFar worse than Ebola\u201d isn\u2019t hyperbole.\nBut that demands the coordination from many moving parts, something the Ebola outbreak showed the U.S. lacked abundantly.\nThe death toll from the virus between 2014 and 2015 was 10 times higher than every past Ebola outbreak combined.\nBill Gates says 33 million people could die within a year due to infectious disease.\nAs last year\u2019s Ebola outbreak demonstrated, the world simply isn\u2019t prepared to contain an outbreak of that magnitude."}
