Entering Sunday\u2019s game against the New York Jets, Crowder\u2019s 23 receptions and 204 receiving yards rank third on the team behind wide receiver Pierre Garcon and tight end Jordan Reed.\n\nAt Duke, Crowder caught 283 passes for 3,641 yards and 23 touchdowns in 52 games. He returned 65 punts for 869 yards and four touchdowns.\n\nThe Monroe, North Carolina native was also a standout basketball player at Monroe High School. He averaged 22 points per game his senior year and led his team to the 2010 1A state championship his junior year.\n\nCrowder talked about his NFL debut, playing basketball and more in this week\u2019s Sunday chat.\n\nQ: What were your emotions like during your NFL debut?\n\nA: It was fun. Exciting. I definitely was nervous. But, it was fun and I thought I played really well. It was just butterflies. I always get nervous before any game. That\u2019s how it was in high school, college. I felt like going into the game, I was prepared. Just the common nervousness. Once I got out there and running around, got into the flow of the game, it felt normal.\n\nQ: What would you be doing if you were not playing football?\n\nA: I\u2019d probably be trying to coach or try and find me a job in the marketing area. I got a certificate in marketing. I did a few internships in college with Duke\u2019s sports marketing. I thought that was very interesting.\n\nQ: What was your most embarrassing moment on the football field?\n\nA: In high school, I got stiff-armed. It was my first time playing varsity. They had moved me up from freshmen and I was playing safety, I was really small. I was probably 160, 150 pounds. They threw me in, we were losing, and I played safety. I was in there for three plays and they ran a reverse. I was the only one who saw it so I came in real fast and just got stiff-armed bad. The dude just kept running. I remember it like it was yesterday. It was crazy.\n\nQ: What\u2019s your favorite music to listen to?\n\nA: I\u2019ve got a lot of music I listen to. J. Cole. R&B. I have a variety.\n\nQ: You were a pretty good basketball player in high school. Do you miss it?\n\nA: I haven\u2019t played basketball in a while. I miss playing ball. It was something I was really good at, something I enjoy doing. In the offseason, sometimes I shoot in the gym. My junior year we won a state championship, I scored 20 points in the state game. My senior year I had 40. I had a lot of good basketball games.\n\nQ: What has been the biggest adjustment from college football to the NFL?\n\nA: I don\u2019t know. Everybody says the speed of the game, that\u2019s a big difference. But, I\u2019m adjusting to that better, getting more playing time and getting that experience. The biggest adjustment, I don\u2019t know. I haven\u2019t really thought about it. I guess just the free time once I\u2019m done with work. Not having to have class. A lot of times, I go home, watch film and am just chilling. I\u2019ll play a little video games every now and then. I like to sightsee. I\u2019ve been to D.C. a few times. See some of the monuments and go to the mall and stay busy. Other than that, I\u2019m just relaxing.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Crowder has emerged as a valuable asset to the Redskins' offense as a slot receiver.
