It calls specifically for \u201ccontinuation of reforms passed into law as part of the Affordable Care Act that help people with disabilities lead healthy lives and increase their access to long term services and supports, as well as support further expansion of mental health and substance use services.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe encourage you to share your positions on these issues and where these concerns fall in your priorities,\u201d the letter to candidates concludes. \u201cFurthermore, we urge you to invite persons with disabilities into the conversations concerning the best ways to expand both access and opportunity for all Americans.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe do not offer endorsement of specific candidates or parties, but we will share your efforts and actions on behalf of people with disabilities with our community,\u201d the faith group letter says. \u201cWe encourage everyone to work towards the goal of ensuring that the American experiment of self-government increasingly includes and reflects the voices, concerns and wisdom of people with disabilities.\u201d\n\n\u201cFaith communities have long encouraged their members to engage in responsible citizenship, including voting, and many serve as polling places on Election Day,\u201d said Curtis Ramsey-Lucas, director of interfaith engagement for the American Association of People with Disabilities.\n\nThrough involvement in the REV UP campaign, Ramsey-Lucas said the Interfaith Disability Advocacy Coalition \u201cseeks to build on these efforts by encouraging candidates for public office to make a greater effort to engage the concerns of the disability community.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is our hope that in doing so, the American experiment of self-government increasingly includes and reflects the voices, concerns and wisdom of people with disabilities,\u201d said Ramsey-Lucas, who also serves as managing director of resource development for American Baptist Home Mission Societies.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Baptist News Global", "description": "American Baptist Home Mission Societies has joined more than 100 organizations and individuals encouraging political candidates to address disability concerns.\r\n\r\nThe\u00a0Interfaith Disability Advocacy Coalition, a program of the American Association of People with Disabilities, is collecting signature", "title": "Faith groups work to mobilize \u2018disability vote\u2019", "url": "https://baptistnews.com/2016/04/19/faith-groups-work-to-mobilize-disability-vote/", "image": "https://1648o73kablq2rveyn64glm1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/rev-up-logo-300x200.jpg", "type": "article"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "BNG", "robots": "noodp,noydir", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "American Baptist Home Mission Societies has joined more than 100 organizations and individuals encouraging political candidates to address disability concerns.\nLaunched by the American Association of People with Disabilities, Texas Disability Project, Disability Rights Texas and other disability advocacy groups, the REV UP campaign is an effort to \u201cmake the disability vote count.\u201d REV UP is an acronym for Register, Educate, Vote, Use, (your) Power.\nThe Interfaith Disability Advocacy Coalition, a program of the American Association of People with Disabilities, is collecting signatures to an open letter to candidates from people of faith concerned about the civil rights of 56 million Americans living with a disability.\nThe letter to candidates says Americans with disabilities make valuable contributions to their communities yet continue to face discrimination in many arenas including employment, transportation and education.\nThe letter is part of national campaign launched Feb. 23 to organize people with disabilities, family members, friends, advocates and other Americans into a \u201cdisability vote\u201d bloc with clout on par with other special interest groups to be taken seriously by politicians."}
