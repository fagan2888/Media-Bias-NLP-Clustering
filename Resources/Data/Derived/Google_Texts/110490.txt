Washington, D.C. — In honor of the Latino Enrollment Week of Action for the Affordable Care Act, or ACA, which runs from January 12 to January 18, the Center for American Progress published a fact sheet highlighting the benefits of the ACA for the Latino community. With open enrollment running until February 15, 2015, Vanessa Cárdenas, CAP Vice President of Progress 2050, issued the following statement urging the Hispanic community to visit www.HealthCare.gov to learn more about how to enroll:

The ACA has already benefited a significant portion of the nation’s Hispanic community, but while approximately one in four Latinos continues to be uninsured, there is still much more work to be done. Health care is now more affordable than ever for Latinos, and due in large part to the options available to them via the marketplaces, the ACA has helped improve health and wellness disparities in the community.

On this last point, reflecting on the upcoming U.S. Supreme Court oral arguments scheduled in King v. Burwell, Cárdenas continued:

This latest lawsuit against the Affordable Care Act misreads the statute and could potentially deny health care to millions of Americans, putting in jeopardy the hard work that has already been put into reducing health disparities across the United States and providing vital ongoing, preventive, and chronic-illness care.
