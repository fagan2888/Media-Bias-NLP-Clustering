The two-time all-star is thriving on the court with the Beijing Ducks while becoming one with his adopted hometown away from basketball.\n\nHe is so entrenched, he wants to one day coach China\u2019s national team.\n\n\u201cI plan on living here for the rest of my life,\u201d the 37-year-old point guard and Brooklyn native said in an interview in the lobby of his plush apartment building in the heart of Beijing. \u201cI think they respect me enough to be able to give me the opportunity.\u201d\n\nChina is a world away from Marbury\u2019s life in the U.S., where he endured a string of disappointing stints with several NBA teams. But he has found his groove in Beijing, leading the Ducks to two Chinese Basketball Association championships. He is an unrivaled fan favorite and the team\u2019s on-court leader \u2014 the organization has even erected a statue of him in front of its arena.\n\nMarbury has capitalized on the opportunities China offers to foreign basketball players and other athletes capable of adjusting to the considerable cultural, linguistic and culinary challenges of life in the rising Asian power. Already dominant at the Olympics and Asian Games, the world\u2019s second largest economy is now undergoing a boom in professional sports stoked by foreign coaches and players.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t make nowhere near the money that I made when I was playing in the NBA,\u201d Marbury said, \u201cbut I\u2019m way happier, so I mean, what is that to say?\u201d\n\nA big part of Marbury\u2019s Chinese appeal has been his willingness to embrace local culture and make himself accessible to fans.\n\nHe rides the Beijing subway with a backpack and headphones, posing for photos with people he meets along the way. He dines at local eateries, and digs into the same simple meals as his Chinese teammates.\n\nMarbury has been a vocal supporter of Guoan, Beijing\u2019s beloved local football team, and studied the graceful martial art of tai chi. He even took a stab at learning Chinese before a knee surgery threw him off his lessons.\n\nHe\u2019s also active on Weibo, the ubiquitous Chinese version of Twitter. A typical post: \u201cGood morning China! Live in the moment with pure loving intentions to all. Love is Love!!!\u201d\n\nHe wrote a column \u2014 \u201cStarbury News\u201d \u2014 in the China Daily newspaper, and if he had any negative feelings about China, he kept them to himself.\n\n\u201cMarbury was seen as a loner in America, but he\u2019s completely changed his image here in China. He\u2019s shown huge interest helping both his team and young people generally,\u201d said veteran Chinese sportscaster Xu Jicheng.\n\nBasketball is already hugely popular in China, as is American music and fashion. Urban courts are filled with youngsters showing off their moves, while hip-hop fashions are a favorite of those born in the 1980s and \u201990s.\n\nFans have also connected with Marbury.\n\nWhen he scores for the Ducks, each basket is celebrated by an MC and echoed by fans at the arena operated by the team\u2019s sponsor, Capital Iron and Steel, in Beijing\u2019s far western suburbs. Marbury can still score, he had a 46-point game in a one-point loss to the Xinjiang Flying Tigers.\n\nIt\u2019s not exactly Madison Square Garden, but crowds at the Shougang Basketball Center are enthusiastic. Songs by Sugar Hill Gang and other hip hop classics play over the PA \u2014 with Marbury at the center of it all.\n\n\u201cMarbury is why we come to these games. He\u2019s the one who\u2019s really made them play like they never played before,\u201d said Ricky Chen, a 26-year-old Beijing office worker who endured a two-hour trip on the subway to catch a game with his girlfriend.\n\nA college standout at Georgia Tech, Marbury was a first-round pick in the 1996 NBA draft by Milwaukee, but traded to Minnesota. He also played for New Jersey and Phoenix before joining the New York Knicks amid high expectations that were never realized. His last stop in the NBA was with Boston in 2009.\n\nWith his NBA options becoming limited, Marbury decided in 2010 to head for China in hopes of jump-starting his career.\n\nThat leap of faith landed him initially in gritty Taiyuan in China\u2019s northern coal country. A contract dispute with the Brave Dragons soon left him high and dry, although Marbury said he never considered heading home.\n\n\u201cI was, like, if I go back to America I\u2019m going to get killed by the media. I\u2019m done. This is it. My career is done, my life is over with,\u201d Marbury said.\n\nSalvation came in the form of the Foshan Dragons in the industrial south.\n\nAlong the way, he has relaunched his Starbury sportswear brand, whose logo is tattooed on his shaved head. This fall he was featured in a live musical production using his China experience as an allegory for overcoming hardship.\n\nMarbury is one of dozens of foreign players in the CBA, which allows teams to play two non-Chinese players at a time for a total of six quarters per game. Some have found the success that eluded them in the U.S., such as former NBA journeyman Lester Hudson, the CBA\u2019s MVP last season, and Jamaal Franklin, a former second-round draft pick of the Memphis Grizzlies, the league\u2019s leading scorer this season.\n\nOther NBA All-Stars have given China a shot \u2014 including Metta World Peace, Tracy McGrady and Gilbert Arenas, with varying degrees of success.\n\nBut none embraced the country in the way Marbury has.\n\n\u201cIt makes him one of the few CBA foreigners that aren\u2019t likely to be painted as mercenaries,\u201d said Andrew Crawford, whose website, Shark Fin Hoops, covers Chinese basketball. \u201cHe\u2019s the first foreigner in the CBA to make a huge and sustained deal out of how much he likes being in Beijing, and that means a lot.\u201d\n\nMarbury believes he can play another two or three years but no matter what happens on the court \u2014 or with his coaching ambitions \u2014 he plans to keep China at the center of his life and career.\n\n\u201cI am forever indebted to this country for them helping change my life and my basketball career, and how I\u2019m viewed in the world of basketball.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Former NBA All-Star Stephon Marbury fan favorite in China", "title": "Former NBA All-Star Stephon Marbury fan favorite in China", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/12/25/former-nba-all-star-stephon-marbury-fan-favorite-in-china/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141225_085055_stephon-marbury.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141225_085055_stephon-marbury.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-12-25T20:50:15+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T04:12:56+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd986c\"", "article_summary": "BEIJING \u2014 After a roller-coaster NBA career, Stephon Marbury has found peace in basketball-crazed China.\nBut none embraced the country in the way Marbury has.\nBut he has found his groove in Beijing, leading the Ducks to two Chinese Basketball Association championships.\nWith his NBA options becoming limited, Marbury decided in 2010 to head for China in hopes of jump-starting his career.\n\u201cIt makes him one of the few CBA foreigners that aren\u2019t likely to be painted as mercenaries,\u201d said Andrew Crawford, whose website, Shark Fin Hoops, covers Chinese basketball."}
