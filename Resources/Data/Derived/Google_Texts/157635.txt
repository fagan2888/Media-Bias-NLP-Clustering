Amanda Lynn Hinson

A Long Prairie, Minnesota woman wants to run against Congressman Collin Peterson, to represent the state's seventh district.

Amanda Hinson is a Republican.

She says, on her web page, she is running to defend those who are suffering from, what she considers, over-taxation.

Hinson specifically is targeting the Affordable Care Act---or "Obamacare".

Her web page says she made her announcement official earlier this week at an Otter Tail County Republican gathering.

She will seek her party's backing at the district convention April 29th and 30th in Alexandria.
