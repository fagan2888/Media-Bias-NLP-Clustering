An Idaho school district is cutting hours from more than 150 non-professional employees after determining that new Obamacare rules would cost the district over $1 million.

The Twin Falls, Idaho school district reduced employees’ workweeks from 30 or 34 hours per week to 27 hours per week to avoid paying full health insurance. Beginning in 2016, the Affordable Care Act will mandate employers provide health insurance to any “full time” employee, which includes anyone working a minimum of 30 hours per week.

Teaching aides, cafeteria workers, and other non-professionals were targeted for reduced hours.

Obamacare was implemented one year ago this week.
