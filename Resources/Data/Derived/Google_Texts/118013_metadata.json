Bizarre ravings about the Koch brothers and ginned-up racial controversies; what else do the Democrats have? When is the last time you heard any Democrat talk seriously about any public policy issue? Their policies have failed, and they are out of ammo.\n\nSo once again, the Democrats are betting on the stupidity of voters. They are gambling that distraction and demagoguery can overcome their awful record as a governing party and their lack of any meaningful solutions to the nation\u2019s problems.\n\nSadly, that may not be a bad bet.

With the nation in a deep funk, 2014 could be the acid test for that strategy.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Power Line", "description": "This is Senator Patty Murray, speaking earlier today about the Hobby Lobby case: \u201cJust a few months ago, five men on the Supreme Court decided there should be a group of women across America \u2026", "title": "More Hobby Lobby Insanity: Are We As Dumb As the Democrats Think?", "url": "http://on.powerlineblog.com/archives/2014/09/more-hobby-lobby-insanity-are-we-as-dumb-as-the-democrats-think.php", "image": "http://www.powerlineblog.com/wp-content/themes/powerline/images/icon.png", "locale": "en_US", "type": "powerlineblog:article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://i2.wp.com/www.powerlineblog.com/ed-assets/2014/09/shutterstock_150570791.jpg?resize=500%2C304&w=240", "site": "@powerlineus", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "NOODP", "wp-parsely_version": "1.7", "fb": {"admins": "505151,john.hinderaker,scottwynnjohnson,750972908", "app_id": 154257474630565}, "article": {"published_time": "2014-09-11T00:40:04+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-09-11T00:46:22+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1fea\"", "article_summary": "\u201329 out of 30 students were able to identify one or more celebrities involved in the nude photo hacking scandal.\n\u20134 out of 30 students were able to name one of the American journalists beheaded at the hands of ISIS.\nThis video tells the story; statistics below:Here are the numbers:\u20136 out of 30 students recognized this week is the anniversary of the September 11th terrorist attacks.\nMencken once wrote that \u201cNo one ever went broke underestimating the intelligence of the American public.\u201d The Democratic Party has taken his words to heart.\nYoung America\u2019s Foundation went to George Washington University, in Washington, D.C., to gauge students\u2019 awareness of current events."}
