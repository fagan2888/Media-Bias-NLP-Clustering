A man was shot and injured during a Saturday morning disturbance in Loveland, officials said.

Loveland police officers went to the 3500 block of Butternut Drive around 9:17 a.m. after hearing about a physical disturbance, according to a Loveland police news release.

As officers headed to the scene, someone was shot among the group that officers were going to check on.

The disturbance involved two groups of people who knew each other, police said.

When officers arrived on the scene, the two groups had separated and the 23-year-old injured Loveland man was transported to a local hospital, the release said.

The man had been shot in the torso. He was treated and released.

Two other men reported minor injuries from the fight, police said, but refused treatment.

Investigators believe they have been in contact with everyone involved, including the man who fired the gun.

The investigation is ongoing, and the case will be brought to the Larimer County District Attorney’s Office to determine what, if any, charges will be filed.

“Investigators do not believe there is a threat to the community related to this incident,” the release said.

Anyone with information about the incident is asked to call Detective Henry Stucky at 970-962-2249.
