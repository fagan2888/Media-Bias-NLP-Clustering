After spending nearly $100 million to get an amnesty bill, Facebook co-founder Mark Zuckerberg’s FWD.us is not giving up–even if President Barack Obama is signaling that he has.

After Obama said Monday that he would start unilaterally changing the country’s immigration laws, Joe Green, the president of FWD.us, was frustrated that House Speaker John Boehner (R-OH) told the President that there would not be a vote on amnesty this year.

“While President Obama has taken necessary steps to address temporarily some of the urgent problems plaguing our nation in the face of over a year of unacceptable inaction by House Republicans, the only way to solve this problem is a permanent legislative solution,” Green said. “We remain deeply disappointed and urge them to pass legislation to fix our broken immigration system as soon as possible.”

Facebook, like much of the high-tech industry, wants massive increases in the number of guest-worker visas, even though numerous nonpartisan scholars and studies have proven that America has a surplus–not a shortage–of high-tech workers.
