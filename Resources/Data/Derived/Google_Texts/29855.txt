Fires that started as controlled burns have spread multiple times and cause out-of-control grass fires.

A fire near McConnell Air Force Base started as a controlled burn when someone tried to clear yard debris from a lagoon. At the time of the fire, the winds were in the criteria for allowing the burn to happen. As the morning went on, the winds increased and the fire spread.

No people were hurt and no homes were damaged. One resident in the area had multiple machines valued as several thousand dollars damaged.

No recent rainfall, low humidity and the Kansas wind have created a high fire danger. Many counties in the state have issued Red Flag Warnings which indicate conditions are primed for fires to grow out of control.

Sedgwick County Fire Captain Robert Timmons says that there are ways to prevent a controlled burn from growing out of control. "Wetting down the area downwind, in case any sparks or embers fly, keeping the grass mowed super short and having a water source, to give you a chance of stopping it before it gets to neighbors property," Captain Timmons said.

Many residents are rushing to burn the yard debris from their property before a burn ban goes into effect in April. The April burn ban is in place because of range burning in the Flint Hills; there is too much smoke that accumulates when the range burning occurs with outdoor burning in counties west of the Flint Hills. The EPA monitors the amount of smoke and smog in Wichita during the range burning in the Flint Hills.
