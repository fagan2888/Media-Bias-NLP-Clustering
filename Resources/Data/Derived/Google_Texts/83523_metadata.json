I was telling somebody recently that I work with kids that are HIV positive, and they were like, \u2018Really? Are there very many of those anymore? I didn\u2019t think HIV was a big deal anymore.\u2019 And I was just astounded by that response. So clearly, I think in terms of education, it\u2019s become less relevant because people think there is less of it, and it\u2019s become less relevant because it\u2019s not scary anymore.\u201d\n\nHealth News Florida Editor Mary Shedden speaks with University of South Florida physician Diane Straub about HIV infection in Florida.\n\nThe rates of new infection increased about 12 percent over the past year. Do you have any sense of why that may be, and what does that say to you, as someone who has been watching?\n\nStraub: \u201cI think it says that we are not investing in prevention. In other states, there\u2019s a lot more effort going into preventing HIV. A lot of states are talking about \u2018Let\u2019s make it zero.\u2019 \u2026For instance, New York was the number one state before us and their governor has put a lot of effort and money into it. So there have been needle exchange programs, quite a few different programs that have really attacked HIV transmission rates. And it works. And we have not had that same commitment here in Florida to decrease the rates of HIV infection.\u201d\n\nIn 2014, 428,000 were tested for HIV through county public health departments. That\u2019s significantly more than ever before. And 5,377 Floridians were diagnosed with new infections, the highest number in the country. Why are the numbers up and continue to increase?\n\nStraub: \u201cThe biggest driver right now with new HIV infections is young men who have sex with men. This generation of YMSM did not see all of their friends die from AIDS. They think of HIV as a chronic disease. I\u2019ve given an HIV diagnosis and actually had a kid say, \u2018Oh well, I knew I was going to get it eventually. At least I don\u2019t have to worry about it anymore.\n\nSo there also are a lot of barriers when you get a positive HIV test. You have to disclose to your family, whoch often means disclosing your (sexual) identity. And there is a lot of homophobia, which makes it very difficult to do. There are a lot of barriers of getting into the medical system. Once you get into the medical system, you have to actually get the medication and they are very expensive. And then adhering to the medication can be very difficult. So it\u2019s a long process from HIV diagnosis to getting virally suppressed.\n\nAnd when you\u2019re not virally suppressed, and you are still having sex, you\u2019re spreading it to others. So a lot of the emphasis in recent years has been to not just testing, but also to getting them treated. Because that is where we are going to prevent transmission.\n\nMary Shedden is a reporter for WUSF in Tampa.
