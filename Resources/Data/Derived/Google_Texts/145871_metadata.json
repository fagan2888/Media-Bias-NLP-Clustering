Bill Shuster (R-Pa.), said the hearing will give lawmakers a chance to weigh on a multi-year extension of the transportation funding measure.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cOur nation\u2019s economy depends on a safe, efficient surface transportation system, and one of the Transportation Committee\u2019s priorities is to address the needs of the system,\u201d Shuster said in a statement announcing the markup.\n\n\u201cNext week, the committee will move forward with the policy and authorization provisions of a bill to improve America\u2019s surface transportation infrastructure, reform programs, refocus those programs on national priorities, provide more flexibility and certainty for state and local partners, and welcome innovation,\u201d he continued.\n\nCongress is struggling to come up with a way to pay for an infrastructure funding extension before the Oct. 29 deadline that was set by lawmakers in a temporary extension that was passed in July.\n\nDemocrats in the Senate have pressured House Republicans to pass a six-year highway bill after they rejected a multi-year highway bill from Senate known as the DRIVE Act during the summer because it contained six years' worth of transportation commitments but only three years' worth of guaranteed funding.\n\nThe House instead passed a three-month highway bill that is set to expire on Oct. 29, legislation the Senate was forced to accept to prevent an interruption in federal transportation spending.\n\nTransportation advocates often complain that Congress has not passed an infrastructure measure that lasts longer than two years since 2005 due to a highway funding shortfall that is estimated to be $16 billion annually.\n\nThe traditional source for transportation funding is revenue that is collected by the federal gas tax, which is currently set at 18.4 cents per gallon. The gas tax brings about $34 billion per year, but the federal government typically spends about $50 billion annually on transportation projects.\n\nTransportation advocates have pushed for a gas tax increase to help make up the difference, but Shuster and other Republicans have been reluctant to ask drivers to pay more at the pump.\n\nThe Department of Transportation has warned that it will have to begin cutting back on payments to states and local governments for infrastructure projects in November if Congress does not reach an agreement on a highway bill extension this month.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The long-awaited hearing will take place on Oct. 22.", "description": "The long-awaited hearing will take place on Oct. 22.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Keith Laing", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "The long-awaited hearing will take place on Oct. 22.", "title": "House schedules highway bill markup", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/transportation/256896-house-schedules-highway-bill-markup", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/article_images/highwayconstruction_070715gn.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-10-14T13:45:33-04:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2015-10-14T13:45-04:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/transportation/256896-house-schedules-highway-bill-markup", "dcterms.date": "2015-10-14T11:16-04:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Keith Laing", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Highway bill, Highway Trust Fund, MAP-21 Reauthorization, Gas Tax, DRIVE Act,Bill Shuster,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-10-14T11:16:25-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-10-14T13:45:33-04:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/transportation/256896-house-schedules-highway-bill-markup", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "The long-awaited hearing will take place on Oct. 22.", "card": "summary", "title": "House schedules highway bill markup"}, "dcterms.title": "House schedules highway bill markup"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd6509\"", "article_summary": "The House is planning to mark up a long-term transportation funding bill on Oct. 22, just days before the scheduled expiration of the nation's infrastructure spending.\nThe House instead passed a three-month highway bill that is set to expire on Oct. 29, legislation the Senate was forced to accept to prevent an interruption in federal transportation spending.\nDemocrats in the Senate have pressured House Republicans to pass a six-year highway bill after they rejected a multi-year highway bill from Senate known as the DRIVE Act during the summer because it contained six years' worth of transportation commitments but only three years' worth of guaranteed funding.\nThe panel's chairman, Rep.
