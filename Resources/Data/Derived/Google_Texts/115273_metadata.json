Clarke Co. Sheriff Todd Kemp says a male and female were held against their will for more than two hours. The male hostage escaped while the woman was trying to do the same.\n\n\u201cAs he was leaving, shots were fired at him and his vehicle,\u201d Kemp says.\n\nSheriff Kemp says the woman was dragged back into the house. Mississippi Highway Patrol SWAT team was called in.\n\n\u201cWhile we were staging at the church, we heard approximately 17 shots,\u201d Kemp says.\n\nAfter about five hours they made entry into the home and took Verbie Watkins into custody. The woman was nowhere to be found.\n\n\u201cShe was nowhere nearby. We did wood searches, we searched around ponds, thinking the worst at that point,\u201d Kemp says.\n\nKemp says that wasn\u2019t the case. She also escaped sometime during the standoff. The woman was found around 2 a.m. near the home she was held hostage in. Kemp says the woman and Watkins knew each other.\n\n\u201cThis individual was using this lady as a crutch. Whether it be prescription drugs or finances,\u201d Kemp says.\n\nAccording to Sheriff Kemp, 23-year-old Watkins has had several run-ins with law enforcement around Clarke County, Meridian and even made a terroristic threat in Georgia. Kemp says an argument over prescription pills might have led to the incident.\n\nWatkins is charged with two counts of kidnapping and one count of aggravated domestic violence after that incident last night in the southern part of the county.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"medium": "video", "description": "A hostage situation Thursday night ended peacefully but not before the suspect in the case became violent.", "language": "english", "author": "Tom Williams", "og": {"description": "A hostage situation Thursday night ended peacefully but not before the suspect in the case became violent.", "title": "Clarke Co.
