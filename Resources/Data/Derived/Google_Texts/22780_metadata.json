We are all familiar with the medical routine: The thermometer beeps, the blood pressure gauge sighs, breaths and pulse are recorded\u2014and then we\u2019re asked, these days, how much it hurts on a scale of one to 10. Pain didn\u2019t get there on its own. In fact, the speaker was borrowing a line from the American Pain Society, a patient-advocacy group whose research is supported by pharmaceutical companies. \u201cIn a certain way,\u201d he confessed, \u201cwe have created our own monster.\u201d The speaker was referring to the nationwide surge in prescription drug addiction, particularly opioid painkillers, which now kill nearly 17,000 Americans per year. That represents a four-fold increase over the past decade. In 2012, New Jersey saw roughly 800 opiate-related overdose deaths, according to the state medical examiner, nearly half of which involved heroin, a drug that has lately made a resurgence in the Northeast, particularly among young adults. Their stories usually begin with opioid painkillers prescribed for an injury or operation, shared by friends, or taken from the family medicine cabinet. Too many of their stories end alone, at home, with a needle in the arm, after years of cycling in and out of rehabilitation facilities, jails, and hospitals.

The day\u2019s roster of speakers, all men in suits, sat in the front row. In addition to the ER chief, the state medical examiner and another doctor, there were several current or former Drug Enforcement Administration officials, the head of the state\u2019s Division of Consumer Affairs, a malpractice lawyer, the state\u2019s first assistant attorney general, an adviser from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and a representative from Actavis, a pharmaceutical company. The U.S. Attorney for New Jersey showed up as well, warning of society\u2019s \u201ccavalier\u201d attitude toward prescription drugs and vowing to prosecute unscrupulous doctors. The only woman on the panel, a suburban mother whose young adult son died of a heroin overdose, sat toward the back of the room. There was no mistaking the focus of the day: thorny legal issues rather than lessons in care. If the audience came expecting guidance in the clinical management of pain, they went away disappointed. Who gets to measure suffering? Who draws the line between legitimate relief and drug abuse? Was it the pharmaceutical rep, who told the group that \u201c100 million Americans suffer from chronic pain\u201d (an industry statistic often invoked, but seldom explained)? The state officials, who threatened to revoke physicians\u2019 licenses? The doctors, who urged caution, or the lawyers, who warned of malpractice suits? Or was it the mother, who tearfully recounted her son\u2019s progression from legal painkillers to heroin?\n\nPhysical pain is not merely a private struggle. Pain is also a problem of representation and trust, of rights and responsibilities, and a source of tension between individual and community. Perhaps not surprisingly, efforts to manage it give rise to a chronic American condition: an intimate, unknowable experience co-opted by special interests. Pain, in short, is political. That is the argument Keith Wailoo, a Princeton historian of medicine and public policy scholar, makes in Pain: A Political History, which sets out to show \u201chow the powerful question of other people\u2019s pain became a recurring site for political battle.\u201d Wailoo\u2019s account begins with the post-World War II challenge of caring for disabled veterans, and proceeds through conflicts over entitlement programs, \u201cfetal pain,\u201d euthanasia, and the rise of OxyContin. Wailoo identifies pain as the impetus, and often proxy, for debates\u2014played out in courtrooms as much as in doctors\u2019 offices\u2014about not just health care, but government regulation, business, constitutional rights, and the American character. The pain of the fetus and the pain of the taxpayer mattered most; the addict\u2019s pain was suspect, the housewife's pain imagined. Our modern culture of pain management is a product of this history. So is our modern crisis of opiate addiction. Even 60 years ago, Wailoo writes, \u201cthe issues embedded in pain management were profound in their moral, fiscal, and civic implications.\u201d For Eisenhower, the decision of how much public relief to devote to private pain\u2014 specifically, in military hospitals\u2014was influenced by considerations of grit, sacrifice, and virtue. Eisenhower would \u201cnot allow mere sympathy to drive government expansion,\u201d Wailoo writes; he signed the 1956 law creating Social Security Disability Insurance with more than a little ambivalence. During the following decade, the debate over pain broadened, as mortality from infectious diseases gave way to chronic, degenerative ailments. The shift reflected an affluent, aging society, and a workforce expanding fitfully to include women and African Americans. Courts embraced a liberal, subjective standard of \u201creal\u201d pain, rejecting the notion that discomfort was a fact of life; those who in earlier years might have been dismissed as malingerers were now guaranteed treatment and protection. Medicare and Medicaid were born, and a \u201cbureaucracy of relief\u201d grew throughout the 1960s and 1970s.\n\nWailoo dates the modern era of pain politics to Reagan, whose acolytes saw in the welfare state \u201ca failed and overliberalized society taken in by subjective complaints of pain.\u201d The time had come, they urged, for \u201ca conservative restoration founded on objective criteria for measuring true need.\u201d Wailoo makes the case that, in the 1980s, pain became \u201ca wedge issue and a litmus test for one\u2019s views on crime, fraud, and dependency writ large.\u201d Disability rolls were slashed; judges and politicians became the arbiters of whose pain was real and whose pain mattered. The pain of the fetus and the pain of the taxpayer mattered most; the addict\u2019s pain was suspect, the housewife\u2019s pain imagined, the disabled worker\u2019s pain symptomatic of a weak society, Wailoo writes. The great irony, which Wailoo does not miss, is that deregulation and government retreat allowed the pharmaceutical industry to expand, virtually unchecked, to meet the demand for analgesia\u2014in turn creating new clinical criteria for pain, new opportunities for treatment, and new markets for drugs. The pendulum swing was extreme, abetted by a growing sentiment in the medical community that doctors had been unduly constrained by the War on Drugs, and that a crisis of undertreated chronic pain was at hand. By the early 1990s, in the era of Bill \u201cI feel your pain\u201d Clinton, \u201cthe question of relief (granted or denied) was being reframed as a legal question of malpractice, as a moral question of medical duty, and as a political question of patients\u2019 rights,\u201d Wailoo writes. Rush Limbaugh\u2019s revelation, in 2003, that he was addicted to OxyContin \u201cshed light on the exuberant drug market that regulatory reform had produced,\u201d Wailoo writes. \u201c[B]ut OxyContin\u2019s rise also forced both liberals and conservatives to look closely at the world they had made\u2014a marketplace that claimed to solve Americans\u2019 problems far more efficiently and completely than government programs ever could, but one that also had the capacity for great harm.\u201d The result is gaps in treatment, a glut of pills, and a landscape of addiction\u2014the inevitable consequence of our \"unquenchable appetite for relief.\" In 2009, 257 million painkiller prescriptions were dispensed in the U.S., according to a White House report. The CDC estimates that 12 million Americans abuse prescription painkillers, which are now prescribed for everything from minor surgery to end-stage cancer, as broader definitions of \u201cchronic pain\u201d have led to an expanded market for opioids. Of those 12 million, the CDC representative at the Hackensack symposium reported, a small but increasing number appear to be turning to heroin\u2014a cheap, potent, and abundant alternative to legal narcotics. Between 2007 and 2012, the number of past-year reported heroin users in the U.S. nearly doubled, from 373,000 to 669,000, according to federal surveys. Our healthcare system has not proved particularly adept at balancing the needs of an aging, aching population against the market forces of a booming pharmaceutical industry. The result is gaps in treatment, a glut of pills, and a landscape of addiction\u2014the inevitable consequence of what Wailoo calls our \u201cunquenchable appetite for relief.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The legal, medical, and pharmaceutical industries have all struggled to locate the line between analgesia and drug abuse.", "author": "Rebecca Davis O'Brien", "og": {"site_name": "The Atlantic", "description": "The legal, medical, and pharmaceutical industries have all struggled to locate the line between analgesia and drug abuse.", "title": "Who Has a Right to Pain Relief?", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2014/08/3825822831_f26a3f923e_o/lead_large.jpg", "url": "http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2014/08/do-people-in-pain-have-a-right-to-relief/375948/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "theatlantic.com", "site": "@theatlantic", "card": "summary"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "p": {"domain_verify": "68e1a0361a557708fefc992f3309ed70"}, "fb": {"admins": "577048155,17301937", "page_id": 29259828486, "app_id": 100770816677686}, "keywords": "The Atlantic, The Atlantic Magazine, TheAtlantic.com, Atlantic, news, opinion, breaking news, analysis, commentary, business, politics, culture, international, science, technology, national and life", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, width=device-width, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe164c\"", "article_summary": "The pain of the fetus and the pain of the taxpayer mattered most; the addict\u2019s pain was suspect, the housewife\u2019s pain imagined, the disabled worker\u2019s pain symptomatic of a weak society, Wailoo writes.\nThe pain of the fetus and the pain of the taxpayer mattered most; the addict\u2019s pain was suspect, the housewife's pain imagined.\nIn fact, the speaker was borrowing a line from the American Pain Society, a patient-advocacy group whose research is supported by pharmaceutical companies.\nWas it the pharmaceutical rep, who told the group that \u201c100 million Americans suffer from chronic pain\u201d (an industry statistic often invoked, but seldom explained)?\nRelated Story Treating Chronic Pain With Meditation But the symposium called attention to a dilemma facing clinicians and American society at large\u2014one that has unfolded in conference rooms, statehouses, and courts."}
