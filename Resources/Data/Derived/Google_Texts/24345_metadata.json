It gave us our rights and our freedoms as Americans. It outlined the limited role of our government and defined the separation of powers. It is the foundation that has allowed America to become the greatest country in the world.\n\nAnd it\u2019s still the law of the land\u2014no matter how often President Obama tries to ignore it or how many ways Democrats try to rewrite it.\n\nFrom rewriting ObamaCare to appointing judicial and bureaucratic officials without authorization, Obama is trampling our Constitution and abusing his power.\n\nRepublicans refuse to allow the president to step on our Constitution. We know our founding document is to be revered and followed, not treated as an advice guide; that is why we will continue to fight presidential overreach at every turn. The House has already taken steps to sue the president for not faithfully executing the laws. But , the Senate, led by Harry Reid, has joined the president in ignoring the Constitution. Reid has enabled Obama to abuse his powers and ignore our founding document.\n\nWe cannot sit on the sidelines while Democrats run roughshod over the Constitution\u2014that is why the election this November is so important. America needs your help to protect our Constitution and to do that we need to elect leaders who respect and will adhere to the Constitution. So this November honor the Constitution by voting and doing all you can to help Republicans win the six seats needed to reclaim the Senate.", "article_metadata": {"description": "On this day in 1787, 39 patriots signed the U.S. Constitution, a document that not only organized our government but also changed the world..05/26/2016 4:04:49AM EST.", "author": "Reince  Priebus", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "On this day in 1787, 39 patriots signed the U.S. Constitution, a document that not only organized our government but also changed the world.", "title": "Reince  Priebus - To Protect the Constitution We Must Win the Senate", "url": "http://townhall.com/columnists/reincepriebus/2014/09/17/to-protect-the-constitution-we-must-win-the-senate-n1893102", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/uploads/2014/9/17/5.png", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "On this day in 1787, 39 patriots signed the U.S. Constitution, a document that not only organized our government but also changed the world.", "title": "Reince  Priebus - To Protect the Constitution We Must Win the Senate", "url": "http://townhall.com/columnists/reincepriebus/2014/09/17/to-protect-the-constitution-we-must-win-the-senate-n1893102", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/uploads/2014/9/17/5.png", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "To Protect the Constitution We Must Win the Senate, Reince  Priebus, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcaf6d\"", "article_summary": "America needs your help to protect our Constitution and to do that we need to elect leaders who respect and will adhere to the Constitution.\nSo this November honor the Constitution by voting and doing all you can to help Republicans win the six seats needed to reclaim the Senate.\nBut , the Senate, led by Harry Reid, has joined the president in ignoring the Constitution.\nFrom rewriting ObamaCare to appointing judicial and bureaucratic officials without authorization, Obama is trampling our Constitution and abusing his power.\nThe Constitution made America unique in its design and governance."}
