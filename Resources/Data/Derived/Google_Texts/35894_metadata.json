Their only consistency is their double standards and their determination to slash hydrocarbon use, ensure that electricity prices \u201cnecessarily skyrocket,\u201d expand federal government command and control, and \u201cfundamentally transform\u201d America.\n\nThe president was thus eager to give away Seal Team secrets in bragging about \u201che\u201d got Osama bin Laden. But in sharp contrast, there has been no transparency on Benghazi, Fast and Furious, the IRS scandal \u2013 or the data and analyses that supposedly support Environmental Protection Agency claims that \u201cdangerous manmade climate change\u201d is \u201cnot just a future threat; it is happening right now.\u201d\n\nThat rhetoric made it sound like EPA\u2019s Clean Power Plan was designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. However, in July EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy made it clear that her initiative \u201cis not about pollution control.\u201d Rather, it is an \u201cinvestment strategy\u201d designed to spur renewable energy.\n\nSenator Jeff Sessions (R-AL) opined that the agency does not have \u201cexplicit statutory authority\u201d to steer investments toward \u201cgreen\u201d energy. Perhaps so, McCarthy replied, but her actions are legal under the Clean Air Act and within the agency\u2019s ever broadening purview \u2013 as are EPA\u2019s attempts to expand its mission and oversight authority by emphasizing \u201csustainable development\u201d and \u201cenvironmental justice.\u201d\n\nThe ironies abound. Wind, solar and ethanol power were intended to address \u201cimminent oil and gas depletion\u201d that ended with the hydraulic fracturing revolution, and prevent \u201cglobal warming\u201d that ended some 18 years ago. Now \u201cinvestment\u201d in these \u201calternative\u201d energy technologies primarily involves greenback dollars taken from hard-working taxpayers and delivered to crony corporatists and campaign contributors who want to earn fat profits from climate scares, renewable energy mandates and subsidies.\n\nA 2010 report suggested that EPA should begin to examine how it might \u201cencourage the development of sustainable communities, biodiversity protection, clean energy, environmentally sustainable economic development and climate change.\u201d Talk about an open-ended invitation to control our lives. A few weeks ago, EPA proclaimed \u201cenvironmental justice\u201d as yet another new cause celebre. The agency claims low-income groups are \u201cdisproportionately affected\u201d by airborne pollution, and therefore it must tighten air quality standards yet again. The results will likely be a perverse opposite of true justice.\n\nThe agency\u2019s own Urban Air Toxics report chronicles a 66% reduction in benzene levels, 84% in outdoor airborne lead, 84% in mercury from coal-fueled power plants, and huge reductions in particulates (soot). \u201cBut we know our work is not done yet,\u201d McCarthy said. \u201cAt the core of EPA\u2019s mission is the pursuit of environmental justice \u2013 striving for clean air, water and healthy land for every American; and we are committed to reducing remaining pollution, especially in low-income neighborhoods.\u201d\n\nMost air quality and health experts say America\u2019s air is completely safe. That\u2019s why EPA pays its Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee and the American Lung Association millions of dollars a year to say otherwise. It\u2019s why the EPA, CASAC and ALA refuse to discuss the $353 billion in annual regulatory compliance costs that EPA alone imposes on U.S. businesses and families (out of a total federal regulatory bill of $1.9 trillion), according to Competitive Enterprise Institute studies.\n\nThose costs mean too many people lose their jobs. Their hopes, dreams, pride and work ethic are replaced by despair and dependency. If they can find new work, they are forced to work multiple jobs, commute longer distances, and spend greater portions of their incomes on gasoline and electricity. They suffer greater sleep deprivation, stress, depression, drug and alcohol abuse, spousal and child abuse, and poorer nutrition and medical care. More people have strokes and heart attacks; more die prematurely.\n\nEPA\u2019s new 54.5-mile-per-gallon standards mean cars are lighter and less safe in accidents. That means more people suffer severe injuries or get killed. Minority and other poor families are especially at risk.\n\nEvery one of these impacts is also a matter of environmental justice. But EPA chooses to ignore them.\n\nMoreover, nothing in the law says EPA has a right to declare that it intends to seek \u201cjustice\u201d by drawing a line between poor people and other Americans, all of whom have a stake in clean air. McCarthy\u2019s language is more befitting a rabble-rouser than an agency administrator who is supposed make decisions based on science \u2013 not on emotions, politics, or racial and class divisiveness.\n\nEPA\u2019s climate and environmental policies appear destined to become even more insane. Just two months after calling climate change \u201cthe world\u2019s most fearsome weapon of mass destruction\u201d \u2013 and amid radical Islamist chaos and conflagrations across the Arab world \u2013 on September 3, Secretary of State John Kerry actually said \u201cMuslim-majority countries are among the most vulnerable\u201d to climate change. \u201cScriptures,\u201d he claimed, make it clear that Americans have a \u201cresponsibility\u201d to prevent this calamity.\n\nMcCarthy\u2019s environmental justice claims also appear to be based on an ugly premise that undergirds many Obama Administration policies: that low-income people are victims and businesspeople are guilty of doing irreparable harm to their health and communities. (At least business people who are not aligned with Obama and don\u2019t support liberal/Democrat agendas and candidates are guilty.)\n\nSuch sentiments pit low-income and working-class Americans against businesses. They are a divisive throwback to the 99% versus 1% protests. They ignore the fact that Mr. Kerry, climate politics bankroller Tom Steyer, and President Obama and his fundraiser dinner companions are all part of the 0.1 percent.\n\nThese sentiments also ignore the fact that businesspeople create jobs, give workers opportunities to earn a living for themselves and their families, and develop the employment and life skills to successfully climb the socio-economic ladder. Any company that violates environmental, health, safety, tax and other laws is penalized civilly or criminally \u2013 whereas all too often the regulators themselves escape any accountability or liability for accidental, incompetent and even deliberate actions that hurt their fellow citizens.\n\nMs. McCarthy\u2019s statements also reflect the lengths to which EPA will go to continue expanding its reach and grow its bureaucracy. The agency cannot admit that it has nearly won the battle against dirty air, because thousands of government regulators could lose their jobs. (Never mind the millions of Americans who lose their jobs because of EPA regulators and regulations.) To protect its legions of workers, justify its massive taxpayer-provided budget, and expand it many times over, EPA continues to move the goal posts, by invoking environmental justice, climate change and sustainability \u2013 for which there can never be objective goals and achievements, but only political considerations and subjective \u201cfeelings.\u201d\n\nApparently Ms. McCarthy embraces the ideology that ignores the benefits of affordable energy and of a robust economy that creates jobs and opportunities. In her view, government controls are paramount, even when they stifle self-reliance, creativity and entrepreneurship, destroy jobs, harm human health and welfare, and cast low-income Americans as perpetual victims.\n\nAs Congress of Racial Equality national chairman Roy Innis emphasizes in his book, Energy Keepers / Energy Killers: The new civil rights battle: access to abundant, reliable, affordable energy is essential for individuals, families and communities that want to improve their lives and living standards.\n\nJason Riley puts it just as forcefully in his new book, Please Stop Helping Us: How liberals make it harder for blacks to succeed. Blacks must \u201cdevelop the habits and attitudes that other groups had to develop\u201d to improve their lives, he writes. The real secret to rolling back black unemployment and poverty is to change a culture that has allowed too many black children to grow up without the benefit of a father in the home, and that scorns black intellectual achievement as \u201cacting white.\u201d\n\nEnvironmental protection should never be an \u201cus vs. them\u201d mentality. Such attitudes divide us, rather than bringing us together to improve our nation and world for everyone\u2019s benefit. Ms. McCarthy should base environmental policy on sound science \u2013 and check her phony justice rhetoric at the door.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The agencys real agenda: empire, control, and inverted justice for poor and minority families.05/26/2016 5:40:19AM EST.", "author": "Paul Driessen", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "The agencys real agenda: empire, control, and inverted justice for poor and minority families", "title": "- EPA\u2019s Phony \u201cEnvironmental Justice\u201d Caper", "url": "http://townhall.com/columnists/pauldriessen/2014/09/07/epas-phony-environmental-justice-caper-n1888249", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2014/139/850aeee0-1c9c-40ee-b1e4-927a73bc8676.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "The agencys real agenda: empire, control, and inverted justice for poor and minority families", "title": "- EPA\u2019s Phony \u201cEnvironmental Justice\u201d Caper", "url": "http://townhall.com/columnists/pauldriessen/2014/09/07/epas-phony-environmental-justice-caper-n1888249", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2014/139/850aeee0-1c9c-40ee-b1e4-927a73bc8676.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "EPA\u2019s Phony \u201cEnvironmental Justice\u201d Caper, Paul Driessen, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc0b0\"", "article_summary": "When it comes to energy, climate change, justice and transparency, the Obama Administration and its Environmental Protection Agency want it every possible way.\nA few weeks ago, EPA proclaimed \u201cenvironmental justice\u201d as yet another new cause celebre.\nEvery one of these impacts is also a matter of environmental justice.\nMs. McCarthy should base environmental policy on sound science \u2013 and check her phony justice rhetoric at the door.\nMcCarthy\u2019s environmental justice claims also appear to be based on an ugly premise that undergirds many Obama Administration policies: that low-income people are victims and businesspeople are guilty of doing irreparable harm to their health and communities."}
