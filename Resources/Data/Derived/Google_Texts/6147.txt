The federal government has renewed for another year the contract of Serco Inc., whose Affordable Care Act application processing facility in Wentzville was hit by whistleblower allegations that workers there had little to do.

The new taxpayer-paid contract, which began July 1, will be worth about $98 million. The first-year contract was worth about $114 million, according to figures supplied Thursday by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), which oversees the contract. ...

The federal government, under the auspices of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, gave a five-year, $1.2 billion contract last year to Serco Inc., a British based company with American headquarters in northern Virginia. The contract has one-year renewal options.

Serco and CMS had anticipated as many as 6 million paper applications to come in under the new health care law, commonly called Obamacare, but only about 300,000 came in, CMS acknowledged last month.

Whistleblowers said employees sometimes slept or played board games for lack of work, and members of Missouriâ€™s congressional delegation demanded inquiries. CMS Director Marilyn Tavenner responded in letters to the delegation last month, but did not address the whistleblower allegations.
