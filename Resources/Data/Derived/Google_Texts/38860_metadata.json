Gregory Buckley Jr. told his father what was troubling him: From his bunk in southern Afghanistan, he could hear Afghan police officers sexually abusing boys they had brought to the base.\n\n\u201cAt night we can hear them screaming, but we\u2019re not allowed to do anything about it,\u201d the Marine\u2019s father, Gregory Buckley Sr., recalled his son telling him before he was shot to death at the base in 2012. He urged his son to tell his superiors. \u201cMy son said that his officers told him to look the other way because it\u2019s their culture.\u201d\n\nRampant sexual abuse of children has long been a problem in Afghanistan, particularly among armed commanders who dominate much of the rural landscape and can bully the population. The practice is called bacha bazi, literally \u201cboy play,\u201d and U.S. soldiers and Marines have been instructed not to intervene \u2014 in some cases, not even when their Afghan allies have abused boys on military bases, according to interviews and court records.\n\nThe policy has endured as U.S. forces have recruited and organized Afghan militia to help hold territory against the Taliban. But soldiers and Marines have been increasingly troubled that instead of weeding out pedophiles, the U.S. military was arming them in some cases and placing them as the commanders of villages \u2014 and doing little when they began abusing children.\n\n\u201cThe reason we were here is because we heard the terrible things the Taliban were doing to people, how they were taking away human rights,\u201d said Dan Quinn, a former Special Forces captain who beat up a U.S.-backed militia commander for keeping a boy chained to his bed as a sex slave. \u201cBut we were putting people into power who would do things that were worse than the Taliban did \u2014 that was something village elders voiced to me.\u201d\n\nThe policy of instructing soldiers to ignore pedophilia by their Afghan allies is coming under new scrutiny, particularly as it emerges that service members like Quinn have faced discipline, even career ruin, for disobeying it.\n\nAfter the beating, the Army relieved Quinn of his command and pulled him from Afghanistan. He has since left the military.\n\nFour years later, the Army is also trying to forcibly retire Sgt. 1st Class Charles Martland, a Special Forces member who joined Quinn in beating up the commander.\n\n\u201cThe Army contends that Martland and others should have looked the other way (a contention that I believe is nonsense),\u201d Rep. Duncan Hunter, R-Calif., who hopes to save Martland\u2019s career, wrote last week to the Pentagon\u2019s inspector general.\n\nIn Martland\u2019s case, the Army said it could not comment because of the Privacy Act.\n\nWhen asked about U.S. military policy, the spokesman for the U.S. command in Afghanistan, Col. Brian Tribus, wrote in an email: \u201cGenerally, allegations of child sexual abuse by Afghan military or police personnel would be a matter of domestic Afghan criminal law.\u201d He added that \u201cthere would be no express requirement that U.S. military personnel in Afghanistan report it.\u201d An exception, he said, is when rape is being used as a weapon of war.\n\nThe U.S. policy of nonintervention was intended to maintain good relations with the Afghan police and militia units the United States has trained to fight the Taliban. It also reflected a reluctance to impose cultural values in a country where pederasty is rife, particularly among powerful men, for whom being surrounded by young teenagers can be a mark of social status.\n\nBut the U.S. policy of treating pedophilia as a cultural issue has often alienated the villages whose children were being preyed upon. The pitfalls of the policy emerged clearly as U.S. Special Forces soldiers began to form Afghan Local Police militias to hold villages that U.S. forces had retaken from the Taliban in 2010 and 2011.\n\nBy the summer of 2011, Quinn and Martland, both Green Berets on their second tour in northern Kunduz province, began to receive dire complaints about the Afghan Local Police units they were training and supporting.\n\nFirst, one of the militia commanders raped a 14- or 15-year-old girl whom he had spotted working in the fields. Quinn informed the provincial police chief, who soon levied punishment. \u201cHe got one day in jail, and then she was forced to marry him,\u201d Quinn said.\n\nIn September 2011, an Afghan woman, visibly bruised, showed up at a U.S. base with her son, who was limping. One of the Afghan police commanders in the area, Abdul Rahman, had abducted the boy and forced him to become a sex slave, chained to his bed, the woman explained. When she sought her son\u2019s return, she herself was beaten. Her son had eventually been released, but she was afraid it would happen again she told the Americans on the base.\n\nShe explained that because \u201cher son was such a good-looking kid, he was a status symbol\u201d local commanders coveted, recalled Quinn, who did not speak to the woman directly but was told about her visit when he returned to the base from a mission later that day.\n\nSo Quinn summoned Abdul Rahman and confronted him about what he had done. The police commander acknowledged that it was true, but brushed it off. When the U.S. officer began to lecture about \u201chow you are held to a higher standard if you are working with U.S. forces, and people expect more of you,\u201d the commander began to laugh.\n\n\u201cI picked him up and threw him onto the ground,\u201d Quinn said. Martland joined in, he said. \u201cI did this to make sure the message was understood that if he went back to the boy, that it was not going to be tolerated,\u201d Quinn recalled.\n\nThere is disagreement over the extent of the commander\u2019s injuries. Quinn said they were not serious, which was corroborated by an Afghan official who saw the commander afterward.\n\n(The commander, Abdul Rahman, was killed two years ago in a Taliban ambush. His brother said in an interview that his brother had never raped the boy, but was the victim of a false accusation engineered by his enemies.)\n\nMartland, who received a Bronze Star for valor for his actions during a Taliban ambush, wrote in a letter to the Army this year that he and Quinn \u201cfelt that morally we could no longer stand by and allow our A.L.P. to commit atrocities,\u201d referring to the Afghan Local Police.\n\nJoseph Goldstein,\n\nNew York Times", "article_metadata": {"liveFyreID": "aHR0cDovL3RoZXNjb29wYmxvZy5kYWxsYXNuZXdzLmNvbS8yMDE1LzA5L3Utcy1zb2xkaWVycy10b2xkLXRvLWlnbm9yZS1hZmdoYW4tYWxsaWVzLXNleHVhbC1hYnVzZS1vZi1ib3lzLmh0bWwv", "generator": "WordPress 3.9.12", "author": "Chris Siron", "og": {"site_name": "The Scoop Blog", "description": "&nbsp; From the New York Times: KABUL, Afghanistan \u2014 In his last phone call home, Lance Cpl.
