It should result in them being in jail!\u201d Kim Kataguiri yelled, denouncing Rousseff and her predecessor, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva.\n\nThe March 15 demonstration was the largest Sao Paulo had seen in more than three decades, since 1984 protests demanding democratic elections after a long dictatorship.\n\nBut more surprising than the crowd of over 200,000, according to the Datafolha polling and statistics agency, was the fact it was being led by Kataguiri, a skinny, 19-year-old college dropout, and other young Brazilian activists inspired by libertarianism and conservative free-market ideals.\n\nThe grandson of Japanese immigrants, Kataguiri is a social media star whose quirky videos skewer Rousseff and the ruling party\u2019s social welfare policies. His ascent as a protest figure has been rapid. Two years ago, when protests erupted across Brazil over corruption and poor public services, Kataguiri was a high schooler who avoided the unrest.\n\nToday, he is the public face of the Free Brazil Movement, a growing force that is more focused than the 2013 unrest that expressed a wide range of middle-class anger. Brazil\u2019s new wave of protests are seen as a right-leaning movement clearly channeled against Rousseff and her Workers\u2019 Party.\n\nA widening kickback scandal at Petrobras, the state oil company, is one of several complaints undermining the administration. Kataguiri and others are striking a chord with Brazilians fed up with soaring inflation, a high and growing tax burden, and those who blame government intervention for hobbling Brazil\u2019s economy, which grew just 0.1 percent last year and is expected to shrink in 2015.\n\n\u201cWe are starting to see an agenda that is very politically driven and clearly against the federal government and President Dilma,\u201d said Carlos Melo, a political scientist at the Sao Paulo-based Insper business school. Compared to 2013, \u201cthese protests are presenting very different visions.\u201d\n\nKataguiri says he had a political awakening two years ago when he began questioning a classmate\u2019s position that a popular cash transfer program applauded by many experts around the globe was responsible for the expansion of Brazil\u2019s middle class and for lifting millions of citizens from poverty during the last decade.\n\nHe believed the credit instead should go to the country\u2019s commodities boom. \u201cThat\u2019s what has helped the poor,\u201d he said.\n\nHe began posting satiric videos to YouTube, which gained a following. He joined two digital media collectives and produced more clips. Along the way, Kataguiri read the works of free-market economists Milton Friedman and Ludwig Von Mises.\n\nHis videos, in which he and his cohorts often don wacky costumes and dress up as political figures such as Fidel Castro, caught the eye of Danilo Gentili, a top late-night TV comedian who fiercely lampoons the government. The comedian asked Kataguiri and other young, anti-Rousseff producers and designers to help create a sketch before the October presidential runoff vote, which saw Rousseff narrowly beat her more conservative, market-friendly opponent.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Teen libertarian is face of Brazil\u2019s young free-market right", "title": "Teen libertarian is face of Brazil\u2019s young free-market right", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Teen libertarian is face of Brazil\u2019s young free-market right", "title": "Teen libertarian is face of Brazil\u2019s young free-market right", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/03/30/teen_libertarian_is_face_of_brazils_young_free_market_right/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/03/brazil-rising-right.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Teen libertarian is face of Brazil\u2019s young free-market right", "title": "Teen libertarian is face of Brazil\u2019s young free-market right", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/03/brazil-rising-right.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Adriana Gomez Licon", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Brazil\u2019s new wave of protests are seen as a right-leaning movement clearly channeled against Rousseff and her Workers\u2019 Party.\nIt should result in them being in jail!\u201d Kim Kataguiri yelled, denouncing Rousseff and her predecessor, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva.\nThe grandson of Japanese immigrants, Kataguiri is a social media star whose quirky videos skewer Rousseff and the ruling party\u2019s social welfare policies.\nAlong the way, Kataguiri read the works of free-market economists Milton Friedman and Ludwig Von Mises.\nTwo years ago, when protests erupted across Brazil over corruption and poor public services, Kataguiri was a high schooler who avoided the unrest."}
