It will be UH\u2019s fifth and UnitedHealthcare\u2019s second ACO in the state.\n\nOne of the most talked-about provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, ACOs are a cost-saving method of delivering care by a network of doctors and hospitals. The main goal of an ACO is to promote efficiency by improving communication between all the doctors involved in a patient\u2019s care, improving quality, outcomes and patient experience, and advocating wellness and preventive care.\n\nUnder the UH and UnitedHealthcare ACO, UH\u2019s staff will work to better coordinate the care for UnitedHealthcare plan participants by increasing communication, providing monthly updates on patients, and maintaining a secure patient registry, among other changes.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s exciting. We\u2019re truly some of the market leaders in this across the country,\u201d said Dr. Eric Bieber, UH\u2019s chief medical officer. \u201cFor us, this is how we think care should be delivered.\u201d\n\nBieber said that patients would see more focus on prevention and wellness, as well as more screening for diseases such as breast and colon cancer.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about trying to keep people well, not about acute episodic illness, which has been the real focus of American healthcare for the last century,\u201d he said. \u201cWe try to limit the amount of real disruption, but if we don\u2019t do anything any different, we shouldn\u2019t expect a different outcome.\u201d\n\nUH now has 170,000 patients in its pediatric, employee, commercial and Medicare ACOs. The largest of these programs manages about 65,000 pediatric patients through a $12.7 million grant from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation. About 25,000 employees are part of the University Hospitals Accountable Care Organization, or UHACO, and an additional 42,000 Medicare patients are managed under University Hospitals Coordinated Care, which rolled out in 2012. Another 10,000 patients are part of a collaboration with health insurer Cigna, announced in November.\n\nTom Sullivan, UnitedHealthcare\u2019s executive director for Northern Ohio, said the ACO model makes good business sense.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re pursuing these discussions throughout the state because we really think it makes all the sense in the world,\u201d he said, because of the payoffs in quality improvement, better patient experience, and cost savings. \u201cThe employer community has really been calling for this for some time.\u201d\n\nIn August, UnitedHealthcare also formed an ACO with Mount Carmel Health Partners, a physician hospital organization jointly owned by Columbus, Ohio-based Mount Carmel Health System and 1,500 physicians. That ACO covers more than 20,000 plan participants. The insurer is also part of 13 other ACO collaborations across the country.\n\n\u201cWhat I think we\u2019re all driving towards is improved quality of care, but also a reduction in overall cost,\u201d Sullivan said.\n\nBieber emphasized that the model does not mean skimping on care. Ideally, better preventive and primary care saves money over the long term.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re finding these care gaps and filling them, then the magic is that health care costs actually are then reduced,\u201d he said. \u201cWe think this is what healthcare is going to look like for everyone in the future.\u201d\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "accountable-care-organization,aco,eric-bieber,tom-sullivan,unitedhealthcare", "title": "University Hospitals, UnitedHealthcare collaborate on accountable care organization (ACO)", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"University Hospitals, UnitedHealthcare collaborate on accountable care organization (ACO)\", \"link\": \"http://www.cleveland.com/healthfit/index.ssf/2013/12/university_hospitals_unitedhea.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://imgick.cleveland.com/home/cleve-media/width620/img/health_impact/photo/13099881-standard.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"11847126\", \"pub_date\": \"2013-12-19T11:14:30Z\", \"author\": \"Brie Zeltner, The Plain Dealer\", \"tags\": [\"accountable-care-organization\",\"aco\",\"eric-bieber\",\"tom-sullivan\",\"unitedhealthcare\"] }", "twitter": {"image": "http://media.cleveland.com/health_impact/photo/13099881-thumb_square_large.jpg", "creator": "@briezeltner", "site": "@clevelanddotcom", "card": "summary", "description": "The UH and UnitedHealthcare ACO will cover about 19,000 plan participants who currently receive care from UH doctors and is designed to improve quality and reduce cost."}, "article_date_updated": "Thursday, December 19, 2013,  6:14 AM", "parsely-metadata": "{\"image_url\": \"http://media.cleveland.com/health_impact/photo/uh-cmc-lerner-tower-horizjpg-cc811fd7d68e745a.jpg\", \"author_name\": \"bzeltner\", \"author_nickname\": \"Brie Zeltner, The Plain Dealer\", \"author_id\": \"5262\", \"source_blog_name\": \"Health and Fitness\", \"source_blog_url\": \"http://www.cleveland.com/healthfit/index.ssf/\", \"sponsored_content\": \"0\" }", "og": {"site_name": "cleveland.com", "description": "The UH and UnitedHealthcare ACO will cover about 19,000 plan participants who currently receive care from UH doctors and is designed to improve quality and reduce cost.", "title": "University Hospitals, UnitedHealthcare collaborate on accountable care organization (ACO)", "url": "http://www.cleveland.com/healthfit/index.ssf/2013/12/university_hospitals_unitedhea.html", "image": "http://media.cleveland.com/design/alpha/img/logo_cleve.gif", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "cleveland.com", "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Thursday, December 19, 2013,  6:00 AM", "article_author": "Brie Zeltner, The Plain Dealer", "Description": "The UH and UnitedHealthcare ACO will cover about 19,000 plan participants who currently receive care from UH doctors and is designed to improve quality and reduce cost."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce39e\"", "article_summary": "About 25,000 employees are part of the University Hospitals Accountable Care Organization, or UHACO, and an additional 42,000 Medicare patients are managed under University Hospitals Coordinated Care, which rolled out in 2012.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re finding these care gaps and filling them, then the magic is that health care costs actually are then reduced,\u201d he said.\nCLEVELAND, Ohio-- University Hospitals and UnitedHealthcare, one of the country\u2019s largest health insurers, will soon collaborate on a new accountable care organization, or ACO, designed to coordinate care and reduce costs for participants enrolled in the insurer\u2019s employer-sponsored health plans.\nThe ACO, which will launch Feb. 1, will cover 19,000 participants who currently receive care from UH providers.\nUnder the UH and UnitedHealthcare ACO, UH\u2019s staff will work to better coordinate the care for UnitedHealthcare plan participants by increasing communication, providing monthly updates on patients, and maintaining a secure patient registry, among other changes."}
