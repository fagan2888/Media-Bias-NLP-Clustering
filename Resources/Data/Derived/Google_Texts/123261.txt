Utah’s new Republican representative, Congressman Mia Love, gave a heartfelt speech to Congress on Tuesday before they voted to repeal Obamacare 239 to 186.

She appealed to members of the House to forget about “tweaking” aspects of Obamacare and asked for an outright repeal and replace.

She read a letter from one of her constituents highlighting the problems many Americans are having with health care, including increased costs, premiums, and deductibles.

The mother who wrote this letter emphasized that her daughter was about to give birth to her second child; but due to their insurance prices doubling under Obamacare, they are no longer excited about the child and more worried about their future.

This mother left a lingering question for Congress to ponder before their vote: “How can insurance for everyone be of help if it causes such a financial burden on families?”

Love suggested what the health care system could look like should Obamacare be repealed.

“Imagine a health care system that is centered in service. Imagine a health care system that is measured by outcomes, not by Washington dictates,” she said. “I know that it is hard for some of my colleagues to contemplate, but imagine… a health care system where dollars and decisions are left with patients, their families, and their doctor.”

“I see an American exceptionalism at work where families and innovation and compassion drive the highest quality of care,” she continued. “Members of Congress, representatives of the people, do not settle!”
