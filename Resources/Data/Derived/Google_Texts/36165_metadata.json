Johnson to serve as RCRMC\u2019s interim chief of operations, putting reforms into effect.\n\nIt was the Johnson contract that Jeffries disliked. The supervisor expressed displeasure that the Department of Human Resources revised the contract over the weekend to reflect a mandatory $155,000 contribution that the county will have to make on behalf of Johnson into the California Public Employees\u2019 Retirement System, even though he will be serving in a short-term capacity of less than two years.\n\nThe RCRMC has been operating in the red since early last year and is close to accumulating losses at a rate of $1 million a week, according to county officials. RCRMC\u2019s current cash shortage stands at $86 million.\n\nAround three-dozen Huron consultants were brought aboard in May to conduct an audit and reported to the board in September that a number of efficiencies and policy reforms could be put into effect that would close the hospital\u2019s funding gap.\n\nHuron consultants said they have a strategic plan to return the hospital to self-sufficiency and position it for revenue growth, projecting that if initiatives are successfully implemented, RCRMC could end the 2014-15 fiscal year with $70 million in receipts.\n\nDetails of the plan were vague. However, county Executive Office officials pointed out that Huron had already identified a pharmacy benefits discount program expected to net the county $8 million to $10 million in savings in the current fiscal year.\n\nDuring a board hearing on Sept. 10, then-RCRMC Director Doug Bagley explained that the medical center\u2019s shortfall stemmed from county and state actions. The hospital began hemorrhaging funds when the board imposed across- the-board cuts as part of a 2009 general fund deficit control plan, Bagley said.\n\nFurther exacerbating the situation is the rising cost of operating an infirmary for a growing number of jail inmates \u2014 an expense for which the hospital has not been adequately compensated, according to Bagley.\n\nHe said treating patients under the care of the county Department of Mental Health is another largely unreimbursed expense, and it has only gotten worse since realignment legislation was enacted in 2011, making what used to be a state function a county responsibility \u2014 without commensurate funding.\n\nTreating uninsured patients who rarely pay their bills has hollowed out the hospital\u2019s appropriations, as well, Bagley said.\n\nAccording to county Executive Office spokesman Ray Smith, county Department of Purchasing & Fleet Management officials have been working with hospital staff to expedite treatment authorization requests for patients on Medi-Cal so that the county can get paid faster.\n\nThe 111-page contract has an exit clause allowing the county to opt out if at any time officials determine that Huron is not meeting expectations.\n\nExecutive Office documents note that Huron has a number of past satisfied clients, including UC Irvine, Natividad Medical Center in Monterey and the Salinas Valley Memorial Health Care System. In the case of Natividad, Huron helped turn $25 million in operating losses into $6.6 million in revenue gains, according to the county.\n\nUnder the contract with Johnson, he will be paid $450,667 for the remainder of the current fiscal year and $676,000 during 2014-15. The compensation is in line with what hospital CEOs are earning in Los Angeles and Orange counties, according to the Department of Human Resources.\n\nCounty officials said Johnson has worked in the healthcare industry for 35 years, serving in executive capacities at more than 30 hospitals and other medical facilities.\n\n\u201dGiven his niche skillset, proven track record of hospital transformation and the anticipated financial improvements he will produce, Mr. Johnson\u2019s cost is a prudent investment,\u201d human resources chief Barbara Olivier said.\n\n\n\nSupervisors to Scrutinize Proposed $25 Million Contract with Consultants\n\nRIVERSIDE \u2013 A healthcare consulting firm hired by Riverside County to find ways of fixing the financially ailing county hospital could be awarded a $25.85 million contract today to stay on the job until the medical center\u2019s fortunes turn.\n\nThe Board of Supervisors will debate whether Chicago-based Huron Consulting Inc. should be retained through at least September 2015 to implement a range of reforms aimed at putting the Riverside County Regional Medical Center on secure financial footing.\n\nThe Moreno Valley hospital has been operating in the red since early last year and is close to accumulating losses at a rate of $1 million a week, according to county officials.

The Board of Supervisors will debate whether Chicago-based Huron Consulting Inc. should be retained through at least September 2015 to implement a range of reforms aimed at putting the Riverside County Regional Medical Center on secure financial footing.\n\nThe Moreno Valley hospital has been operating in the red since early last year and is close to accumulating losses at a rate of $1 million a week, according to county officials. By the end of the current fiscal year, RCRMC\u2019s deficit will be around $50 million if the status quo doesn\u2019t change.\n\nAround three-dozen Huron consultants were brought aboard in May to conduct an audit and reported to the board in September that a number of efficiencies and policy reforms could be put into effect that would close the hospital\u2019s funding gap.\n\nIn an introduction to the proposed 111-page contract with the county, Huron consultants said they have a strategic plan to return the hospital to self-sufficiency and position it for revenue growth, projecting that if initiatives are successfully implemented, RCRMC could end the 2014-15 fiscal year with $70 million in receipts.\n\nDetails of the plan were vague.
