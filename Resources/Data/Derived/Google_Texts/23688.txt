A Chicago man accused by federal authorities of repeatedly violating an order banning him from entering the Rosebud Sioux Indian Reservation in South Dakota has been sentenced to one year in prison.



Acting U.S. Attorney Randolph Seiler says 44-year-old Steven Nichols was also ordered to spend one year on supervised release and to not re-enter the lands of Todd County and the reservation.



On September 2011, Nichols was barred from the reservation and escorted off tribal lands. The reason wasn't immediately clear.



Federal authorities say Nichols violated that tribal order at least three times, and as a result, he was sentenced to nine months in federal custody in September. He was placed on a work release program, but he was again found on tribal land in January.



Nichols was charged with criminal trespass following the January incident. He later pleaded guilty to the charge.
