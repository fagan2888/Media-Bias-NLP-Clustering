It has saved tens of thousands of Americans from premature death and has already insured more than 12 million people. It has already defined Barack Obama\u2019s legacy and will inevitably be at the center of the 2016 election. So why do so many on the left despise it? Take \u201cWhat\u2019s the Matter With Kansas?\u201d author Thomas Frank. In Salon he asks of the Affordable Care Act, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t [Obama] propose a proper health care program instead of the confusing jumble we got?\u201d Harvard Medical School\u2019s Dr. Marcia Angell claims that, \u201cObama gutted the law before it was even passed.\u201d Liberal blogger Lambert Strether, whose Corrente blog has an \u201cObamacare Clusterfuck\u201d tab, writes, \u201cIf Obama, and the Democrats, had truly wanted a universal plan that guaranteed health care for all Americas [sic] as a right, they had the political power to pass it.\u201d Former New Republic senior editor Noam Scheiber criticized the ACA in the New York Times for making it, \u201call but impossible\u201d for Obama \u201cto build support among whites.\u201d The ACA critics are right that a public option or a single payer \u201cMedicare for all\u201d program would make our health care system less wasteful and more equitable. But as political scientist Scott Lemieux has repeatedly demonstrated, Obama passed the most liberal bill he could have in the small window when Democrats controlled both chambers of Congress. Claims that the disappointing bill resulted from a failure of nerve or ambition represent little more than wishful thinking. To understand why the ACA was the best we could get, it\u2019s important to note some distinctive features of the American political system. First, the American system is majoritarian (the party with the most votes in a constituency wins all the seats) rather than proportional (seats are assigned in proportion of the total vote). In a recent paper, political scientists Torben Iversen and David Soskice show that majoritarian systems are more inclined toward center-right parties because the middle class have an incentive to side with the rich. As the chart below shows, majoritarian systems are more likely to have a right-wing government.\n\n\n\nGovernment partisanship by electoral system, 1948\u201398\n\n\n\nSource: Torben Iversen and David Soskice, 2008. Seventeen countries surveyed.\n\nSecond, there is the Senate, whose very purpose was to cool political passions for reform. Because every state sends two representatives, regardless of the state\u2019s size, it is already stacked in favor of rural interests. The fact that Republicans have begun using the filibuster has made progress even more difficult, since any legislation now requires a 60-vote supermajority rather than a simple majority. In a recent study, five prominent political scientists argued that the status quo bias in the Senate has prevented government action on inequality, benefiting the rich. Given this dynamic, it should be unsurprising that presidents, despite popular illusions to the contrary, have little ability to twist Congress into supporting their policy, as political scientist George Edwards has persuasively shown. Third, voter turnout is a key variable to creating progressive policy, as I\u2019ve argued repeatedly. However, the United States lags far behind other Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development countries in voter turnout. Fourth, the failure of campaign-finance reform has also blunted the success of the left, and the ACA is an example: Health care companies spent millions influencing the legislation. Numerous political scientists have noted how money in politics has prevented action on inequality from both parties.\n\nProgressives should see the ACA as a key step toward our aims of a more just society, rather than a betrayal.\n\nThere are also important social factors to keep in mind. Racism in the United States, for example, severely constrains progressive possibilities. Scholars, most recently Ian Haney Lopez, have extensively documented how conservative politicians have exploited racism to tear down the safety net. I\u2019ve shown that the levels of Temporary Assistance For Needy Families (TANF) benefits can be in large part predicted by racial animus. The country\u2019s individualism also poses a challenge: Americans are far more likely to accept individualist narratives of success and failure. They are more likely to blame the poor for their poverty and therefore oppose expanding the social safety net (see chart).\n\n\n\nAttitudes about poverty in Europe and the United States\n\n\n\nSource: Alberto Alesina, Edward Glaeser and Bruce Sacerdote, 2001.\n\nGiven these structural and social impediments, you might wonder how anything progressive has ever happened in the United States. And indeed, our safety net is shoddy and increasingly benefits the middle class and the elite. The CBO estimates that in 1979, the bottom quintile received 50 percent of transfer payments, while in 2007, the group received only 35 percent of transfers. In 2010, the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities estimated that the poorest quintile received about 32 percent of entitlement benefits, indicating that the welfare state in the U.S. is generally aimed at the middle class, unlike the Affordable Care Act. These facts make the achievement of the ACA even more remarkable. As the chart below shows, the bill\u2019s benefits are concentrated on the bottom fifth.\n\n\n\nChange in average income\n\n\n\nSource: Henry J. Aaron and Gary Burtless, January 2014.\n\nThe Medicaid expansion provision of the ACA is also a rare example of a government policy that directly benefits the poor, particularly poor people of color. Although progressives now look at the New Deal and the Great Society with rosy optimism, those programs systematically excluded people of color. During the first two decades of its existence, Social Security excluded agricultural and domestic workers, which disproportionately harmed people of color. The postwar GI Bill, which helped to create the American middle class, also cut blacks out almost entirely, leaving them to live in poor neighborhoods. In contrast, people of color benefited immensely from the ACA, as shown below.\n\n\n\nPercent uninsured, by group\n\n\n\nSource: Gallup, April 2015.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The left should learn to love the Affordable Care Act, a landmark extension of the welfare state", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=810543104, affiliate-data=10lxKx", "og": {"url": "http://america.aljazeera.com/opinions/2015/5/in-2016-democrats-need-to-embrace-obamacare.html", "image": {"width": 1460, "identifier": "http://america.aljazeera.com/content/ajam/opinions/2015/5/in-2016-democrats-need-to-embrace-obamacare/jcr:content/headlineImage.adapt.1460.high.Obamacare_helping_poor_a.1431626466226.jpg", "height": 911}, "type": "article", "description": "The left should learn to love the Affordable Care Act, a landmark extension of the welfare state", "title": "OPINION: In 2016, Democrats need to embrace \u2018Obamacare\u2019"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://america.aljazeera.com/content/ajam/opinions/2015/5/in-2016-democrats-need-to-embrace-obamacare/jcr:content/headlineImage.adapt.1460.high.Obamacare_helping_poor_a.1431626466226.jpg", "title": "OPINION: In 2016, Democrats need to embrace \u2018Obamacare\u2019", "description": "The left should learn to love the Affordable Care Act, a landmark extension of the welfare state", "card": "summary", "site": "@AJAM"}, "google-play-app": "app-id=com.aljazeera.simple", "keywords": "Health Care, Democratic Party, Election 2016, Obamacare, U.S.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "However, the United States lags far behind other Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development countries in voter turnout.\nGiven these structural and social impediments, you might wonder how anything progressive has ever happened in the United States.\nTo understand why the ACA was the best we could get, it\u2019s important to note some distinctive features of the American political system.\nRacism in the United States, for example, severely constrains progressive possibilities.\nIt has already defined Barack Obama\u2019s legacy and will inevitably be at the center of the 2016 election."}
