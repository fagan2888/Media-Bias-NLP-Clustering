It’s been a sleepy fall for Lehigh Valley congressional races.

As we’ve noted several times, Republican congressman Charlie Dent has no opponent. And so far, the 17th District contest between Democratic U.S. Rep. Matt Cartwright and Republican David Moylan has been fairly quiet.

But after reporting nearly empty campaign coffers following his three-way primary, Moylan’s campaign announced Thursday that they’re airing a 30-second TV spot on cable channels in Schuylkill, Carbon, Monroe, and Northampton counties. (The district includes Easton and part of northeastern Northampton County.)

The ad highlights Moylan’s resume as a radiation oncologist, describing the country as “gravely ill.” It notes his opposition to Obamacare and amnesty for those who entered the country illegally.

“Let’s get America healthy again,” the ad’s narrator says. “Vote Dr. David Moylan – the cure for Congress.”

Moylan’s campaign manager, Hank Clarke, did not respond to questions about the size of the ad buy, but said it will be airing on an assortment of channels -- including Fox News, CNN, The History Channel, Discovery Channel, and BRCTV-13 -- “from now until Election Day.”

Moylan's latest finance report, which was due Wednesday, isn’t available yet on the Federal Election Commission website. But it will need to show some strong summer fundraising to pay for the TV spot – Moylan’s June filing reported him having less than $100 on hand.
