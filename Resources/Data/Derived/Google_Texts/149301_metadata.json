A new program aims to tackle food insecurity among some Chicago-area children and their parents.\n\nGuadalupe Guzman has been coming to the Logan Square Health Center for more than a dozen years. During a visit this fall, her doctor started asking her about food.\n\n\u201cShe asked me how much I was feeding the boys, how many times a day, what were the portions, how much milk, dairy they were taking into their system,\u201d Guzman said.\n\nGuzman\u2019s main job is as a tax preparer, so she only works consistently a few months each year. And that can make buying fresh food hard.\n\n\u201cWe could buy certain amounts of fruits and vegetables, and it got to the point where it was too expensive for us to maintain,\u201d Guzman said. \u201cIt\u2019s a family of five, so when this opportunity came up I was really excited to get fruits and vegetables.\u201d\n\nThat opportunity is a new partnership between the Cook County Health and Hospitals System and the Greater Chicago Food Depository. Once a month, the Depository is sending a fresh food truck to the county\u2019s Logan Square Health Center. Right now, it\u2019s a pilot program. Doctors have started asking questions to screen for food insecurity.\n\n\u201cSince September of this year, over half of our patients have screened positive for food insecurity,\u201d said pediatrician Dr. Denise Cunill, medical director of the Logan Square Health Center. She says expanded access to health insurance under the Affordable Care Act has brought more people into her clinic\u2013many of them working poor, making just enough money not to qualify for state and federal programs that could help them get fresh food.\n\n\u201cWhat they end up doing is cutting back on meals or purchasing pre-packaged meals outside of the home that perhaps cost a little bit less compared with fruits and vegetables and other more nutrient-dense foods,\u201d Cunill said.\n\n\u201cQuality fresh food can be the most expensive food, and for too many families it\u2019s hard to come by,\u201d said Kate Maehr, CEO of the Greater Chicago Food Depository.\n\nWith that in mind, the depository wants to expand its focus to bring fresh foods into the community\u2013driven, in part, by data from a Feeding America survey.\n\n\u201cWe realized that we no longer had the luxury to distribute any food,\u201d Maehr said. \u201cWe had to be really mindful about the types of food that we were connecting our neighbors with.\u201d\n\nThe partnership between Cook County and the food depository is backed by new recommendations from the American Academy of Pediatrics to screen young patients for food insecurity.\n\nBut identifying patients who need access to fresh fruits and vegetables is a lot easier than getting that food to them.\n\n\u201cFrankly, that presents a real challenge for us right now. We have to go out every day and get donations of this fresh food in, and we also need donations of financial support to make sure that we have the infrastructure: the refrigeration, the refrigerated trucks that make it possible to move that food throughout the network,\u201d Maehr said.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not just adding infrastructure\u2013it\u2019s changing mindsets.\n\n\u201cHunger is not something that is taught in medical school,\u201d Maher said. \u201cAnd so it requires us sitting down with providers and health systems and helping them understand why we really need to fight to make sure that all of the men and women and children who are coming into clinics have access to the food that they need to be healthy.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s easy for Dr. Cunill to understand why it\u2019s important. In food insecure families, she says younger kids tend to have anemia and obesity. In the older kids, it\u2019s mental illnesses like depression.\n\n\u201cThey are trying to figure out, \u2018How can I help mom and dad or my parent stretch this month\u2019s money so that we have food for my younger siblings?\u2019\u201d\n\nThe hope is that connecting pediatric and adult patients with fresh food means better health outcomes\u2013and less money spent on health care\u2013in the long run.\n\nThe county and the depository plan to expand the pilot program to the Cottage Grove health clinic in Ford Heights in February. The goal is to have monthly fresh food truck visits at all 16 Cook County health clinics by 2017.\n\nMore health stories from \"Chicago Tonight\"\n\nMedical Marijuana Hits the Shelves at Chicago\u2019s First Dispensary\n\nState-approved medical marijuana has arrived in Chicago\u2019s Andersonville neighborhood.
