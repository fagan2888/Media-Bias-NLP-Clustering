And we thought, \u2018It\u2019ll be so bizarre for us and the crowd, so let\u2019s do it!\u2019 But then it became like a memorial tour and a way to raise money for his family.\u201d The \u201chis family\u201d in question is that of Robert Casale, a.k.a. Bob 2, Gerald\u2019s brother and longtime Devo guitarist/keyboardist who died of heart failure in February at age 61. \u201cBob\u2019s family was destitute because he didn\u2019t have insurance and there\u2019s all these catastrophic care bills because he was trying to get Obamacare right when it happened,\u201d Casale said. \u201cSo we started a donation site that Pearl Jam and Shepard Fairey put on their sites. But that wasn\u2019t enough to help with (Bob\u2019s) family not losing their house.\u201d Casale had already pitched the idea for a \u201cHardcore Devo\u201d tour, as the band\u2019s 1974-1977 period has come to be known, which would consist exclusively of songs originally recorded on four-track tape machines in the basements of Akron, Ohio, where Devo formed. \u2013 [Denver Post]\n\nAlways fans of high concepts, Devo devolved for their current \u201chardcore\u201d tour \u2014 their first since the death of guitarist Bob Casale \u2014 which focuses entirely on the band\u2019s early, experimental years before signing to Warner Brothers. For fans of the \u201cJocko Homo\u201d / \u201cUncontrollable Urge\u201d era, this is mid-\u201970s paydirt. That tour, which was dedicated to the late Casale and was a fundraiser for his family, hit NYC last night (6/19) for a show at Time\u2019s Square\u2019s Best Buy Theater. The show began with Mark Mothersbaugh coming out alone, sitting at his keyboard and leafing through a copy of the evening news (from 1974), and the band joined one by one later. The first half of the show was played sitting down, and the jumpsuits didn\u2019t come out till later in the show. As for their signature Energy Dome headgear, you had to look to audience members for those last night.\n\nMore pictures from last night, and Devo\u2019s setlist, below\u2026\n\n\n\n\u2014\n\nSETLIST: Devo @ Best Buy Theatre 6/19/2014\n\nMechanical Man\n\nAuto Modown\n\nSpace Girl Blues\n\nBaby Talkin\u2019 Bitches\n\nFraulein\n\nI Been Refused\n\nBamboo Bimbo\n\nBeehive\n\nMidget\n\n(I Can\u2019t Get No) Satisfaction\n\nTiming X\n\nSoo Bawls\n\nStop, Look & Listen\n\nOno\n\nBe Stiff\n\nUncontrollable Urge\n\nSocial Fools\n\nJocko Homo\n\nFountain of Filth\n\nGut Feeling\n\nEncore:\n\nBooji Boy\u2019s Funeral\n\nU Got Me Bugged\n\nClockout", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "BrooklynVegan", "description": "The original idea for this tour was, of course, an artistic conceit like Devo often does, Casale said over the phone from California.
