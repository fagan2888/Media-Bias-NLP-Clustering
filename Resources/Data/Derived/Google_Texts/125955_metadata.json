Their chore still will take nearly six hours.\n\nIt\u2019s all because critics have come to have no confidence in Speaker Boehner\u2019s ability to stand up to President Obama on issues ranging from amnesty for illegal aliens to funding Obamacare\u2019s takeover of America\u2019s health system.\n\nThey are responding to the \u201cDon\u2019t Be Yellow: Dump Boehner Campaign\u201d call from WND founder Joseph Farah for voters to let the majority members know their thoughts on those two issues, which both were funded into 2015 in a massive $1.1 trillion spending bill agreed to by Boehner recently.\n\nThe problem is voters gave the GOP huge victories in the 2014 midterm elections at the local and state levels, as well as in the House and Senate, on the basis of halting amnesty and pulling back Obamacare.\n\nFarah said he expects, based on early reaction, to generate millions of letters in time for delivery when the new Congress opens its session early next month.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not the Christmas present John Boehner was hoping to receive,\u201d said Farah. \u201cIt\u2019s clear from the viral nature of this campaign that millions of Americans, mostly Republicans, by the way, would like to put coal in Boehner\u2019s stocking this year. And they\u2019d like him to accept the gift as just another member of the House of Representatives rather than as its leader.\u201d\n\nThe innovative campaign that allows anyone to send a form letter on yellow paper to every Republican member of the House was organized quickly last week in response to growing anger and frustration from GOP voters who feel ripped off by what they see as a betrayal by Boehner and his leadership team over what Farah characterizes as \u201chis capitulation to Obamacare and the unconstitutional amnesty executive action, which were both fully funded by House Republicans who were voted into office to do just the opposite.\u201d\n\nAt about two inches per 500-page ream, there\u2019s already a stack of letters about 17 stories tall destined for guaranteed delivery to House GOP members.\n\n\u201cWhile the news cycle has forgotten about Boehner\u2019s betrayal of Republican voters in November, the grass-roots electorate has not,\u201d said Farah. \u201cEven while Americans are busy Christmas shopping and getting ready for the holiday season, they are angry enough at the Republican establishment to put their money where their mouth is \u2013 investing in this unusual lobbying effort to wake up House members as to the state of their leadership crisis.\n\n\u201cWill Republican House members respond in January? At the very least, they won\u2019t be able to ignore the deluge of mail that awaits them,\u201d he said.\n\nJOIN THE DON\u2019T BE YELLOW, DUMP BOEHNER NOW CAMPAIGN.\n\n\u201cYou can order your letters sent today, and they will be ready for delivery when the new Congress reconvenes in January. It would be great to see thousands or, better yet, tens of thousands flooding in that first week. That will make an impression that cannot be ignored by Republican members of the House,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m excited. Now it\u2019s up to you. I\u2019ve already ordered my letters. I\u2019ve even secured the domain names DumpBoehnerCampaign.com and DumpBoehnerNow.com for social media dissemination. Tell your friends,\u201d he wrote.\n\nRecruit your friends, neighbors, and fellow commuters to the \u201cDon\u2019t Be Yellow: Dump Boehner Now\u201d campaign with this exclusive bumper sticker.\n\nThe letter explains to members of the U.S. House that two issues have \u201cprompted Americans to turn in droves to the Republican Party in November 2014 \u2013 Barack Obama\u2019s blatantly unconstitutional executive action to provide amnesty to millions of illegal aliens, and the deliberately deceptive restructuring of America\u2019s health-care system through Obamacare, which threatens to unravel the greatest health delivery system in the world.\u201d\n\nPointing out that Republicans before the election \u201csolemnly vowed to STOP this lame-duck president,\u201d the letter states: \u201cNow you have the power, right and duty to stop him.\n\n\u201cBut it won\u2019t happen with John Boehner leading you. You know this to be true. The trillion-dollar budget deal is just the latest proof that Boehner is not capable of leading the House to victory during this critical period.\u201d\n\nIt calls on members to replace him.\n\nOn Twitter, the hashtags #BoehnerMustGo and #DumpBoehner were surging, and other commentators, while not adopting the specific letter-writing campaign, agreed with the goal.\n\nJOIN THE DON\u2019T BE YELLOW, DUMP BOEHNER NOW CAMPAIGN.\n\nFarah noted that the launch of the program rivals the historic \u201cPink Slip Campaign\u201d in 2010 that generated some 9.5 million letters to Congress.\n\n\u201cAmericans are angry about Boehner\u2019s betrayal of the voters who gave him a bigger majority in the House and Republicans control of the Senate. This could prove to be Boehner\u2019s undoing,\u201d he said.\n\nThe campaign allows people to send letters, with their own names and addresses via FedEx, all for the one price of $29.95, to each of the House GOP members.\n\nFarah said, \u201cFrom previous campaigns we know this approach prompts members to talk about the boxes of letters that are coming into their offices each day. And that\u2019s exactly what we want to do with the DUMP BOEHNER CAMPAIGN \u2013 a grass-roots lobbying effort that can channel your outrage into effective and meaningful action.\u201d\n\nHe said what can be guaranteed is that members \u201cwill see, hear and feel your participation in it.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe saw the same thing in 2010,\u201d recalled Farah. \u201cPeople were angry then. They may be angrier now. It is as if elections have no consequences when Republicans vote.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Free Press For A Free People Since 1997", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.1", "og": {"site_name": "WND", "description": "Can you scan through a letter, getting the gist of the message, in a minute or so?
