The legal theory rests on an ambiguity in the Constitution and some legal sleight of hand.\n\nGregory L. Diskant, a senior partner at the law firm of Patterson Belknap Webb & Tyler and a member of the national governing board of Common Cause, penned an op-ed in the Washington Post explaining the theory:\n\nThe Constitution glories in its ambiguities, however, and it is possible to read its language to deny the Senate the right to pocket veto the president\u2019s nominations. Start with the appointments clause of the Constitution. It provides that the president \u201cshall nominate, and by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, shall appoint . . . Judges of the supreme Court, and all other Officers of the United States.\u201d Note that the president has two powers: the power to \u201cnominate\u201d and the separate power to \u201cappoint.\u201d In between the nomination and the appointment, the president must seek the \u201cAdvice and Consent of the Senate.\u201d What does that mean, and what happens when the Senate does nothing? In most respects, the meaning of the \u201cAdvice and Consent\u201d clause is obvious. The Senate can always grant or withhold consent by voting on the nominee. The narrower question, starkly presented by the Garland nomination, is what to make of things when the Senate simply fails to perform its constitutional duty. It is altogether proper to view a decision by the Senate not to act as a waiver of its right to provide advice and consent. A waiver is an intentional relinquishment or abandonment of a known right or privilege. As the Supreme Court has said, \u201c \u2018No procedural principle is more familiar to this Court than that a constitutional right,\u2019 or a right of any other sort, \u2018may be forfeited in criminal as well as civil cases by the failure to make timely assertion of the right before a tribunal having jurisdiction to determine it.\u2019 \u201d It is in full accord with traditional notions of waiver to say that the Senate, having been given a reasonable opportunity to provide advice and consent to the president with respect to the nomination of Garland, and having failed to do so, can fairly be deemed to have waived its right.\n\nAre the power to nominate and the power to appoint two separate powers? Sounds dubious to me, but then, I'm not looking to trash the Constitution and set a dangerous precedent by appointing a justice without Senate approval.", "article_metadata": {"page-title": "Can the president appoint a Supreme Court justice without Senate approval?", "title": "Can the president appoint a Supreme Court justice without Senate approval?", "og": {"site_name": "Trending", "description": "Do the 'spirit' of the Constitution and intent of those who wrote it mean anything anymore?", "title": "Dem Lawyer: Obama Can Appoint Garland to SCOTUS Without Senate Approval", "url": "https://pjmedia.com/trending/2016/04/09/dem-lawyer-obama-can-appoint-garland-to-scotus-without-senate-approval/", "image": "https://pajamasmed.hs.llnwd.net/e1/trending/user-content/51/files/2016/04/shutterstock_164838752.sized-770x415xc.jpg", "updated_time": 1464347204, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Do the 'spirit' of the Constitution and intent of those who wrote it mean anything anymore?", "title": "Dem Lawyer: Obama Can Appoint Garland to SCOTUS Without Senate Approval", "url": "https://pjmedia.com/trending/2016/04/09/dem-lawyer-obama-can-appoint-garland-to-scotus-without-senate-approval/", "image": "https://pajamasmed.hs.llnwd.net/e1/trending/user-content/51/files/2016/04/shutterstock_164838752.sized-770x415xc.jpg", "site": "@PJMedia_com", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "pinterest": "nopin", "pinterestDescription": "Dem Lawyer: Obama Can Appoint Garland to SCOTUS Without Senate Approval", "fb": {"app_id": 149848758413844}, "keywords": "Merrick Garland, Constitution, Barack Obama", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Dem Lawyer: Obama Can Appoint Garland to SCOTUS Without Senate ApprovalYou're beginning to hear this legal theory more and more as it becomes clear the Senate has no intention of taking up the nomination of Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court.\nDoes President Obama have the power to appoint a justice of the Supreme Court without getting the Senate's approval?\nIt provides that the president \u201cshall nominate, and by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, shall appoint .\nThe narrower question, starkly presented by the Garland nomination, is what to make of things when the Senate simply fails to perform its constitutional duty.\nAre the power to nominate and the power to appoint two separate powers?"}
