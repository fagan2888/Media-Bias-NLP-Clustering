To put this in another way, I walk four blocks to get to Denver\u2019s downtown, a state of affairs that stretches the powers of the adjective \u201cconvenient.\u201d\n\nWithout a moment\u2019s complaint, the bus drivers relieve me of the burden of traffic and trouble on the Boulder-Denver Turnpike. While they cope with unpredictable and dangerous motorist behavior, I enjoy rare interludes of uninterrupted reading. In truth, when traffic is thick, it is impossible not to look down \u2014 in every sense \u2014 on the automobile drivers who create the congestion and then feel its vexation with the greatest immediacy.\n\nMoreover, on many occasions, the bus also provides a hospitable venue for salons and seminars. I often find myself seated next to people who carry with them treasures of experience and expertise. Thanks to bus-enabled conversations, I have gained new insights into land-use planning, movies, origami, philanthropy, poetry and matters of science and technology.\n\nWhen it comes to recognizing the privileges and opportunities given to bus riders, there is no fudging the fact that the residents of the East Coast have traveled far ahead of Westerners. In a powerful undertow of the spirit, Western life has tempted many to believe that occupying an automobile\u2019s driver\u2019s seat comes with a guarantee of untrammeled freedom, even though this item of faith is not easy to maintain in a traffic jam.\n\nFor four years in Massachusetts in the early 1980s, commuting from Arlington to Cambridge, I underwent my own intensive course of assimilation into Northeastern transportational habits of mind. I started and ended every workday by relying on the work ethic of bus drivers. Possibly one or two of these individuals were grumpy and short-tempered, but those exceptions to the rule left no lasting impression, while the examples of kindness took a permanent place in my mind.\n\nIn Colorado as much as in Massachusetts, bus drivers draw on a psychological tool kit stocked with thoughtfulness and a sense of responsibility, as well as humor and wit.\n\nOn recent trip, an accident had turned the turnpike into a parking lot. As we went nowhere fast, the bus driver mobilized humor on our behalf. \u201cFolks,\u201d he said at one point, \u201cI have bad news. The flight attendant called in sick today, so we won\u2019t be able to serve peanuts and drinks during this delay.\u201d\n\nPlenty of similarly quotable remarks provide evidence in support of the proposition that the bus drivers\u2019 seats give them prime positioning to observe and to psych out their fellow human beings. This has produced abundant material for folklorists \u2014 and for transportation decision-makers \u2014 to collect and ponder.\n\nRecent reports suggest that the years of construction on the Boulder-Denver Turnpike will result in a diminished number of express bus trips. My initial response to this prospect has been, shall we say, not positive.\n\nBut here\u2019s what I wonder: did the decision-makers sit down with the bus drivers to get their opinions and guidance on this plan for the RTD future?\n\nIf the answer is \u201cyes,\u201d I feel better about the plans.\n\nIf the answer is \u201cno,\u201d I would do anything within reason to get the job of facilitator for such consultations\u2014if they are held in sites easily accessible by bus.\n\nPatty Limerick is faculty director and chair of the Center of the American West at the University of Colorado.\n\nTo send a letter to the editor about this article, submit online or check out our guidelines for how to submit by e-mail or mail.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Limerick: Riding express bus from Denver to Boulder provides true convenience", "title": "Limerick: Riding express bus from Denver to Boulder provides true convenience", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/03/13/limerick-riding-express-bus-from-denver-to-boulder-provides-true-convenience/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150313__OP15LIMERICKp1.jpg", "height": 426}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150313__OP15LIMERICKp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-03-13T16:20:32+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-25T17:07:17+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "In Boulder, the express bus to Denver stops four blocks from my house.\nIn a long overdue tribute, I write in praise of bus drivers.\nI started and ended every workday by relying on the work ethic of bus drivers.\nRecent reports suggest that the years of construction on the Boulder-Denver Turnpike will result in a diminished number of express bus trips.\nBut here\u2019s what I wonder: did the decision-makers sit down with the bus drivers to get their opinions and guidance on this plan for the RTD future?"}
