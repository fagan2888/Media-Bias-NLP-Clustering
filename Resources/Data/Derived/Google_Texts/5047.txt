We’re a little more than a month away until Christopher Nolan’s hotly anticipated space flick “Interstellar” arrives and today new clues about the film were revealed in a two-and-a-half minute trailer. “This world’s a tragedy,” Matthew McConaughey says at the beginning. “It’s been telling us to leave for a while now.” His task, as Michael Caine puts it, is to “Get out there and save the world.”

That’s fine and dandy, but us space geeks get a deeper look into the logistics of “Interstellar” space travel. Toward the end of the clip, we learn that McConaughey and his intergalactic space-traveling partner Anne Hathaway land on an Earth-like planet where no animals or land appear, but the ocean they’re floating on contains massively terrifying waves. Will humanity be destroyed or will McConaughey rescue us all? Such is the central question moviegoers will embrace next month.

Along with the new trailer, Paramount announced today that the film will get a special release on Wednesday, November 5, presenting the film in its “native formats.” The early screenings will appear on 70mm IMAX film, 70mm film and 35mm film in more than 240 locations across the U.S. and Canada; tickets are already on sale.

The film hits regular theaters on November 7. For more on “Interstellar,” click here.
