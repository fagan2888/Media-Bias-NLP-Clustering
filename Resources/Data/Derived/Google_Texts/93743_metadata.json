That district has shrunk since its formation in the 1960s and LAFCO officials are not sure why. Documents related to a service agreement with the city of Redding were recently uncovered by city staff.\n\nManuel asked the matter be continued so city staff and LAFCO officials could have a chance to better review those documents and make adjustments.\n\nA proposed sphere of influence update for the Buckeye Fire Protection District on the agenda Tuesday was also delayed, and a public hearing for the Bella Vista Water District was continued to Dec. 18.\n\nThe LAFCO board unanimously approved a municipal service review and sphere of influence update for the Clear Creek Community Service District with some minor changes.\n\nHwy. 44 crash results in minor injuries\n\nA head-on collision in Shingletown that resulted in minor injuries Thursday morning temporarily blocked both lanes of Highway 44.\n\nThe crash involving two sports utility vehicles was reported around 8:30 a.m. near Alpine Meadows Road.\n\nCHP ID\u2019s driver who died in crash\n\nAn Oregon man died Wednesday evening in a crash on Interstate 5 near Lakehead.\n\nOfficials said Darrell Lee Richardson, 66, of Arch Cape, Ore. was traveling south when he lost control of his 1997 Lincoln and careened off the roadway and 100 feet down an embankment.\n\nCalifornia Highway Patrol investigators said Richardson was traveling between 65 and 70 miles per hour in light rain when he entered a turn with a 50-mile-per-hour posted speed limit. The vehicle began to fishtail, sideswiping a tree and hitting another head-on.\n\nThe second tree stopped the vehicle\u2019s forward momentum, though it bounced off the trunk and continued to slide down the steep hillside before coming to rest on its side, the CHP said.\n\nRichardson was pronounced dead at the scene. Alcohol was not believed to have been a factor, investigators said.\n\nStaff reports", "article_metadata": {"title": "North State in Brief: Nov. 21, 2014", "og": {"url": "http://www.redding.com/news/local/north-state-in-brief-nov-21-2014-ep-787133526-362168161.html", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.jrn.com/images/rosales_jpg_9715482_ver1.0_640_480.jpg", "height": 360}, "type": "article", "description": "A roundup of North State news in brief.", "title": "North State in Brief: Nov. 21, 2014"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.jrn.com/images/rosales_jpg_9715482_ver1.0_640_480.jpg", "title": "North State in Brief: Nov. 21, 2014", "description": "A roundup of North State news in brief.", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "https://twitter.com/BreakingNews_RS"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://media.jrn.com/designimages/logo-rrs-icon-144.png?v=2", "__sync_contentCategory": "premium", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdfc6f\"", "article_summary": "Health care seminar set in CottonwoodAn upcoming seminar in Cottonwood will educate North State residents on the Affordable Care Act and help them enroll in a health insurance plan as well.\nThe seminar is 5 to 8 p.m. Dec. 4 at the North Cottonwood School Multi-Purpose Room, 19920 Gas Point Road.\nAt issue with updates to Redding\u2019s sphere are past agreements with the Buckeye Fire Protection District northwest of town.\nThe LAFCO board unanimously approved a municipal service review and sphere of influence update for the Clear Creek Community Service District with some minor changes.\nSphere of influence discussion delayedA proposed update to the city of Redding\u2019s sphere of influence was postponed Thursday due to questions about past, present and future boundaries."}
