(Photo: Getty Images)\n\nDays ahead of his first campaign rally in Ohio. presidential candidate Donald Trump went after Ohio Gov. John Kasich - on Twitter.\n\nBeginning at a little after 8 p.m. Thursday night, Trump took to Twitter and ranted about fellow candidate, Kasich, for nearly an hour.\n\n\"I want to do negative ads on John Kasich, but he is so irrelevant to the race that I don\u2019t want to waste my money,\" read one.\n\nBy 11 p.m., the Kasich campaign had turned the Twitter frenzy into a fundraising plea, emailing supporters about Trump's \"epic twitter rant\" and noting: \"American simply cannot afford to elect someone who isn't prepared to lead our country.\"\n\nKasich's political action committee, New Day for America, had released a new commercial Thursday morning comparing Trump and fellow outsider candidate Dr. Ben Carson to Barack Obama and his \"on-the-job training for president.\"\n\nJohn Weaver, Kasich's strategist, and Kasich's official Twitter handle fired back with an anti-Trump retweet spree.\n\nTrump, the GOP frontrunner according to most polls, is scheduled to hold a rally in Columbus Monday evening.\n\nSome highlights from Trump's tweets include:\n\nGovernor Kasich, whose failed campaign & debating skills have brought him way down in the polls, is going to spend $2.5 million against me. \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 20, 2015\n\nJohn Kasich should focus his special interest money on building up his failed image, not negative ads on me. \u2014 Donald J.
