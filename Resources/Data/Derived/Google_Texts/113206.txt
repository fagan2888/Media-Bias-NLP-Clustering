As of mid-June, Nuggets guard Nate Robinson was on track to return to the team for the start of training camp after tearing his anterior cruciate ligament in January and undergoing surgery.

“Hopefully August,” Robinson told The Post. “I’m trying to sway the doctors to give me a little more leeway.”

Well, based on an Instagram video posted to his account Saturday, it seems he wasn’t messing around. Robinson, all 5 feet and 9 inches of him, is back to throwing down dunks, this one on his outdoor court at his home in Seattle.
