Problems include: product delivery at the end of last year due to inclement weather, delivery delays due to vacation schedules when cars were scheduled to be delivered and the lack of charging stations available to Chinese Tesla drivers.However, Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk anticipates a robust future for his company. He expects there will be 55,000 deliveries in 2015, a total of 500,000 deliveries by 2020 and millions by 2025.With all of this optimism coming from Tesla\u2019s management, there is a good chance that Musk\u2019s predictions for this year could come true. The three biggest things that will impact Tesla this year are: the progress of the Gigafactory in Nevada, sales in China and the release of the Model X and Gen III.\n\nThe Gigafactory is a lithium-ion battery factory that Tesla is currently building in Nevada. The facility has a projected completion date of 2017.\n\nChina sales\n\nThe cost to complete this factory is approximately $5 billion and Tech Times reported in July last year that Panasonic Corp. would be investing $1 billion in Tesla\u2019s project.Panasonic is the Japanese-based, multinational electronic company that supplies all of the batteries for the current Tesla models.According to Seeking Alpha\u2019s news editor Clark Schultz, Tesla made a presentation at ROTH\u2019s conference in California and updated the audience on the factory\u2019s status.Elon Musk even tweeted a picture of the construction site on his personal Twitter account and added that the shot was \u201c(~20 percent of full size) under construction.\u201dHe tweeted again later that day to dispel rumors that had surfaced about the delays in the construction process in Nevada.\u201cThere is no slowdown of the Gigafactory construction underway, as anyone near Reno with eyes can verify. It\u2019s not subtle,\u201d Musk tweeted.Once the factory is completed by 2017, Tesla states it will produce the battery packs and lithium-ion cells for the Gen III and have about 6,500 employees on site.\u201cWe believe TSLA could drive down costs through an industrialization of battery pack assembly economies of scale,\u201d analyst Ben Kallo from Robert W. Baird, a private equity firm in Palo Alto said in his notes. \u201cWe think Panasonic\u2019s partnership could increase production efficiencies and lower costs.\u201d\n\nTesla has faced some struggles in the Chinese market, the biggest ongoing problem being: the lack of charging stations available throughout the large country.\n\nModel X and Gen III\n\nThe company didn\u2019t go into detail about the specific number of sales it acquired from China in 2014, but Musk spoke up about the misperception on the company\u2019s ongoing issue.\u201cAnd the biggest issue which we\u2019re still fighting to address is this perception that it is difficult to charge your car in China,\u201d said Musk. \u201cThis is false, it is not difficult to charge your car in China.\u201dAlong with Musk, Kallo included in his notes how strong demand metrics would quell much of the chatter about Tesla\u2019s Chinese demands.\u201cModel S orders were at 10K entering 2015 and X reservations at 20K,\u201d Kallo said. \u201cThis is the first time TSLA has provided the metric in several quarters, which should dispel demand questions created from China worries, as well as gasoline prices.\u201dEven with the resignation of Tesla China\u2019s president Veronica Wu back in December, Musk is optimistic about the company\u2019s future in the Asian country and plans on adding more charging stations within the region.\n\nUnlike the Model S that\u2019s out on the market right now for a base price of $70,000, the new Gen III that Tesla is currently working on will start at a much lower price of $35,000.\n\nThe new price is much closer to the prices of other electric cars out right now, like BMW\u2019s i3, which has a base price of $42,000 and Nissan Leaf\u2019s 2015 model that also has an even cheaper starting price of $29,000.But the Model X that has been in the works for some time and already has an extensive reservation list may face some problems when it\u2019s finally released.Ryan Brinkman, an analyst from J.P. Morgan, isn\u2019t very optimistic of the future sales.\u201cModel X gross margins are expected to be below the corporate average, given inevitable production inefficiencies and other launch costs associated with the new vehicle launch, as is typical in the auto industry,\u201d Brinkman said.But for those who are looking forward to getting their hands on the newest Tesla cars, the Gen III will be available by 2017, and Tesla expects to have the Model X out on the roads by early 2016.Homepage image courtesy of Tesla Motors.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Peninsula Press", "description": "Tesla Motors Inc., (TSLA) hit some rough patches at the end of 2014, but this year may prove to be different.", "title": "What does 2015 mean for Tesla Motors? - Peninsula Press", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://peninsulapress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/TeslaCharging.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-04-06T10:38:53+00:00", "url": "http://peninsulapress.com/2015/04/03/tesla-motors-2015-outlook/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/PeninsuPress", "section": "Business + Tech", "tag": "TSLA", "published_time": "2015-04-03T09:20:31+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-04-06T10:38:53+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "Tesla Motors Inc., (TSLA) hit some rough patches at the end of 2014, but this year may prove to be different.", "creator": "@PeninsuPress", "image": "http://peninsulapress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/TeslaCharging.jpg", "title": "What does 2015 mean for Tesla Motors? - Peninsula Press", "site": "@PeninsuPress", "card": "summary"}, "generator": "WordPress 4.2.4", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Tesla Motors Inc., (TSLA) hit some rough patches at the end of 2014, but this year may prove to be different.\nThe Palo Alto-based electric car company released its fourth quarter earnings on Feb. 11 and the numbers weren\u2019t very promising.\nThe three biggest things that will impact Tesla this year are: the progress of the Gigafactory in Nevada, sales in China and the release of the Model X and Gen III.\nThe Gigafactory is a lithium-ion battery factory that Tesla is currently building in Nevada.\nUnlike the Model S that\u2019s out on the market right now for a base price of $70,000, the new Gen III that Tesla is currently working on will start at a much lower price of $35,000."}
