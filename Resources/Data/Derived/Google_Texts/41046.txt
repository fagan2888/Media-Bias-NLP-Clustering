According to “Fox Business” commentator Todd Wilemon, the U.S. will slowly slip into Third World status thanks to the Affordable Care Act, so “Daily Show” correspondent Aasif Mandvi set out to see what will happen to the “best health care system in the world.” In order to witness firsthand the horrors of health care, Mandvi traveled all the way to a place where the health care system is so terrible that Stan Brock, founder of the charity Remote Area Medical, has to fly in to assist people who are suffering from a lack of access to quality medical treatment. But where is this god forsaken place? None other than Knoxville, Tenn.

Watch as Wilemon, befuddled by the facts that Mandvi presents him with about the inadequate American health care system, fumbles and fails to explain how this could possibly be the best. Oh, and of course he adds useful tidbits like saying the poor have to just stop being poor, since clearly they’re to blame for the gross inequality plaguing the nation. Maybe if they just stopped being so poor, they could afford some of that “best health care in the world” and we wouldn’t have to change the system.
