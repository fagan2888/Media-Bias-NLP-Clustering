Attendees are encouraged to go to the pig roast held in their commission district. The West Broad Farmers Market, located at 1573 W. Broad St., serves Districts 3, 5 and 6.\n\nAdmission to each pig roast is free, but attendees must complete an anonymous survey to enter. They can fill out the survey at the gate with the assistance of volunteers on iPads, or fill it out ahead of time by visiting www.athenspigroast.com. Each survey takes about five minutes to complete. Attendees that fill out surveys ahead of time will be given a unique number to present at the gate to gain admission to the event.\n\nThe survey begins with a Google map asking survey takers to place a \u201cpin\u201d as close to their street as possible while still remaining anonymous. Once the pin is recorded, all of the answers to questions that follow are tied to that geographic code point on the map, Broyard said. Survey questions include demographic information such as age, race and income level, as well as questions about health coverage and access to healthy food and medical services.\n\nThe answers, along with the geographic code, will be used to create a community-wide map that will act as a visual tool to determine where needs in the community exist and if necessary services exist in those areas, Broyard explained.\n\nIn addition to creating a baseline of social service needs and medical issues in northeast Georgia for the health needs assessment, the information gathered from the surveys also will feed into Community Connection\u2019s new Community Platform software. It includes an inventory of community needs and assets and a database to be used by operators of the agency\u2019s 2-1-1 referral hotline, which helps residents in need find services.\n\n\u201cWe want everybody\u2019s voice to be heard during this data collection process (from the needy to those who are economically successful) because we want to know what\u2019s going on in Athens so we can see where the disconnects are,\u201d Broyard said. \u201cAthens has got everything we need to meet people\u2019s needs ... but we need to work to make sure that our resources are being strategically paired with the needs that they can best address.\u201d\n\nAnyone unable to attend a pig roast in their area is encouraged to fill out a survey online. The deadline to turn in a survey is June 28.\n\nFollow reporter April Burkhart at www.facebook.com/AprilBurkhartABH.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Athens News, Athens Georgia, Athens Banner Herald, Athens, Georgia, Georgia Bulldogs, Dawgs, Bulldogs, Music, UGA, newspaper, 30601, Clarke County, Madison, Oconee, Oglethorpe, Dogs, 30602, 30603, 30604, 30605, Richt, SEC football, Jackson County, R.E.M., Widespread Panic, B-52s, Local News, Blueprint, Features, April Burkhart", "og": {"url": "http://onlineathens.com/local-news/2015-03-15/community-connection-host-pig-roast-conduct-surveys", "site_name": "Online Athens", "image": "http://onlineathens.com/sites/default/files/14198488.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "Community Connection to host pig roast, conduct surveys"}, "description": "OnlineAthens.com is the daily online edition of The Athens (GA) Banner-Herald."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce0a4\"", "article_summary": "That\u2019s what Community Connection of Northeast Georgia hopes to create when the organization presents the Athens Pig Roast 3-7 p.m. Saturday at West Broad Farmers Market.\nAttendees are encouraged to go to the pig roast held in their commission district.\n\u201cThe idea was to bring something to the community that most people haven\u2019t had a chance to experience and I liked the novelty of a pig roast,\u201d Community Connection Executive Director Fenwick Broyard said of organizing a festivity to help collect surveys.\nAdmission to each pig roast is free, but attendees must complete an anonymous survey to enter.\nThe health needs assessment is mandated by Affordable Care Act."}
