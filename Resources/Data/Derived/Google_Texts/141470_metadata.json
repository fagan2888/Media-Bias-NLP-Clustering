(AP) - With his college-bound daughter watching over his shoulder Monday, Gov. Brian Sandoval signed into law legislation creating millions of dollars in incentives to help combat Nevada\u2019s severe teacher shortage.\n\nThe bill establishes scholarships for college students studying education and bonuses for new teachers working in low-rated schools. It\u2019s part of an overall education package totaling hundreds of millions of dollars that the Republican-controlled Legislature recently approved as part of a $1.1 billion tax increase over two years.\n\n\u201cWe have made an historical, unprecedented investment in education,\u201d Sandoval told about two dozen students, teachers and others who gathered in the Reno High School library for the bill signing ceremony Monday afternoon.\n\n\u201cAs I sign this bill, from this day forward I hope I\u2019ve inspired all of you to become a Nevada scholar, a Nevada teacher,\u201d he said alongside daughter Maddy, a senior who is enrolling this fall at the University of Nevada, Reno, where she plans to study to become an elementary school teacher.\n\nIntroduced late in the session, the bill creates the Teach Nevada Scholarship program, which offers up to $3,000 per semester for students studying education or completing a licensing program at Nevada colleges. Students would earn three-quarters of the scholarship while in school, and have the rest awarded to them after teaching in Nevada for five years.\n\n\u201cThese things cost money,\u201d Sandoval said. The second-term GOP governor singled out for thanks Assemblyman Randy Kimer, R-Reno, who represents the neighborhoods surrounding the high school and attended the bill signing ceremony.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how much you followed in your government classes what happened at the Legislature, but it was a tough road at the end,\u201d Sandoval said. \u201cIt really took a lot of courage for some of these people to be supportive of that budget because it meant tax increases. It requires investments.\u201d\n\nThe measure allocates $10 million in incentives and $5 million in teacher training scholarships, with another $10 million in new teacher bonuses added in a last-minute appropriation in Sandoval\u2019s approved two-year budget. That includes a $5,000 yearly bonus as an incentive for new teachers working in lowly rated schools. The program is set to expire after two years.\n\nClark County School District alone is trying to hire more than 2,000 new teachers for next school year. Education officials say low starting pay, difficult working conditions and high demand nationwide is complicating their task.\n\nState Superintendent Dale Erquiaga said failure to address the state\u2019s teacher shortage would translate into failure for other ambitious K-12 education plans included in the governor\u2019s budget.\n\n\u201cThose initiatives will fail if we don\u2019t address the teacher shortage,\u201d he said at a hearing last month. \u201cThat conversation has gotten louder as the session has gone on.\u201d\n\n___\n\nSnyder reported from Carson City, Nevada.", "article_metadata": {"description": "With his college-bound daughter watching over his shoulder Monday, Gov.
