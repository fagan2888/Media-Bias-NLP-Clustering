When she opened the fridge in the country clubhouse, the scene that confronted Sara James seemed innocuous enough.\n\n\n\nJames, newly-arrived from New York and desperate to fit in, had prepared a plate of sandwiches, which she grabbed. She was also delighted to see another plate of sandwiches. Once a waitress, she expertly carried both across to the table.\n\nSo far, so good. As were the sandwiches on the other plate. The unravelling began when another group of players from the next court arrived for their lunch, followed by the sinking realisation that James and her team had, in fact, been scoffing the sandwiches of another team.\n\nNew York Clam Chowder, Leeks, bacon, potatoes, clam veloute at Nieuw Amsterdam Photo: Ken Irwin\n\n\n\nIn the hierarchy of gaffes in the carefully-choreographed world of social tennis etiquette, stealing someone else\u2019s sandwiches was a serious offence. When the mistake was realised, James immediately confessed. \u201cI\u2019m an American,\u201d she offered.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThat helped the international incident soon dissolve into laughter, and some good natured ribbing of James, the sandwich stealer. \u201cThey were giving me a hard time in the most you\u2019re-in-the-club way, which I really like about Australia,\u201d James says.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt broke the tension, it broke the newcomer status. But I couldn\u2019t believe actually that I said, well you know, I\u2019m an American. How bad is that? I threw my whole country under the bus.\n\nIt\u2019s like their fault that I screwed up the sandwiches.\u201d\n\nSara James and Shane Green at Nieuw Amsterdam. Photo: Ken Irwin\n\n\n\nJames has recovered from the sandwich incident, enough not only to laugh about it over our lunch, but also include it in her book, An American in Oz. The mid-week social tennis player (with an unreliable serve) is . an Emmy-award winning correspondent and anchor for NBC. She's a\n\nlong way for from her her New York home and the Rockefeller Centre headquarters of NBC. So for a New York state of mind, she has chosen Nieuw Amsterdam in Hardware Lane, with a distinctly Big Apple ambience.\n\n\n\nWe are seated underneath wall art of the New York skyline, and James is directly below the Empire State building. Even the street scene outside is evocative: the light, the trees, the city life. \u2018\u2018You turn the corner, and say, I could be one of those little lanes near Gramercy Park,\u201d says James. She understands the dichotomy of the traveller: the quest for the new, the more secret search for the familiar.\n\n\n\nAnd then there is the menu. We decide to share, and she chooses New York clam chowder, and in a nod to her Virginian roots, grits fritters. She toys with the idea of a Reuben, but it is probably a good thing that we pass, given her experience with sandwiches. Coffee fuels the conversation.\n\nGrits Fritters, Variety of sweetcorn, heirloom beetroots.at Nieuw Amsterdam Photo: Ken Irwin\n\n\n\nJames had built a formidable career in the US. Always a storyteller - she was writing novels at 8 - she began her career as a 22-year-old. She travelled the country in search of a job, having worked the night shift at CNN in Washington DC, and with a resume tape that included a \u201cteeny tiny\u201d piece of anchoring - \u201cIt was dreadful,\u201d says James. \u201cI think I burnt that tape.\u201d\n\n\n\nShe would ring ahead to TV news directors, could she see them? She had no actual plans to be there, but it was a good opener: if she was in town, they would feel honour-bound to see her. Five minute conversation would often turn into an hour.\n\n\n\nThat turned into a job as an anchor of 9 Alive News on WTVA in Tupelo, Mississippi, birthplace of Elvis. The job paid $14,000 a year. \u201cBut they let me report, and it was great,\u201d says James.\n\nAfter other reporting jobs, her career took off with NBC in New York. She filled in on the Today Show, for Katie Couric, often for the newsreader Ann Curry, and anchored other shows. She also carved out a reputation as a go-anywhere correspondent - within the US, stories of the magnitude of 9/11 and the Oklahoma bombing. Abroad, the job took her from Sarajevo to Somalia.\n\nSARA JAMES AT SARA JAMES AT NIEUW AMSTERDAM Photo: KEN IRWIN\n\n\n\nBut there was another enduring love. In 1994, on a cold February night in, she met Australian journalist Andrew Butcher at a journalists\u2019 dinner. The romance began, turning into marriage in 1998, after Butcher returned to New York following time in Japan, and took the job of spokesman for Rupert Murdoch. They have two children, Sophie and Jacqui.\n\n\n\nIn 2007, their New York world was turned upside down. Butcher, born in Muckleford, population 1100, near Castlemaine, was longing for home. And so the remarkable Australian adventure began. When looking for a place to live, they drew a circle around Melbourne, and stacked the deck to the north and west - near Butcher\u2019s family, and the airport for James. \u201cIt was pretty close to throwing a dart at the map,\u201d says James.\n\n\n\nThat ended up as the Macedon Ranges, and a farm at the end of a dirt track. There was, says James, an uncanny sense of belonging.\n\nNIEUW AMSTERDAM Photo: Ken Irwin\n\n\n\nThe adjustment from Manhattan to Macedon is big enough in itself, and James went through the range of emotions that are common with such a dislocation: the initial novelty of it all, and longing for the place from which you had come.\n\n\n\nBut part of their new life had an added complication. They needed to find the right school for Jacqui, who had a seizure just after she was born, and was eventually diagnosed with special needs. The remarkable Port Phillip School was the perfect place. But the distance between the Macedon Ranges and Port Phillip meant that it felt like she and Jacqui were living in the car. She had moments, she agrees, when you think \u201cI\u2019m going to take my ball and go home.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd they didn\u2019t last very long, you know. They didn\u2019t. I would kind of pick myself up in the morning, and would have to remind myself: Would it really be that much easier?\u201d\n\nReceipt for lunch with Sara James at Nieuw Amsterdam Photo: none\n\n\n\nGoing back would be a known world, and family and old friends would be closer. But she knew the underlying questions were these: \u201cAre we just talking about changing the backdrop, or are we just talking about the fact having a child with complex special needs is going to be difficult wherever you are?\u201d\n\n\n\nJames was also determined not to be the kind of person and makes a big move and whines about it. \u201cI just don\u2019t want to be that person.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe book captures many of the daily struggles, and plenty of the joy of family life in a beautiful setting, wrapping stories around interactions with the bush\u2019s flora and fauna. Snakes, emus and peacocks feature. Her older daughter Sophie, raised in Manhattan, particularly thrived. James was determined not to make it a \u201cMoaning Myrtle memoir\u201d, because that\u2019s not how she feels. \u201cSpecial needs are a part of our family\u2019s picture. That was something Jacqui has. It\u2019s not who she is, and it\u2019s not who our family is.\u201d\n\nSARA JAMES AT NIEUW AMSTERDAM Photo: Ken Irwin\n\n\n\nOf course, Sara James, reporting for NBC, was never far from the picture. Two weeks after moving in, NBC needed an update on a story she had filed for Dateline NBC. Her recording \u201cstudio\u201d had to be the quietest place in the house - the wardrobe, under blankets and a doona.\n\n\n\nThese days, she has a soundproof studio in a shed on the property. A career as the NBC\u2019s correspondent in the region has also taken shape. The girls are older, they have the support of incredible babysitters, and Butcher has the flexibility that comes from running his own PR firm. She also has a fortnightly guest spot on ABC News Breakfast TV, appropriately called an American in Oz. Her father used to tell her she was like a dalmatian on a fire truck. \u201cWhen the story\u2019s happening, you\u2019re out the door.\u201d\n\n\n\nAlways the storyteller, she is keen to write fiction, thinking about something in the young adult genre. She has a ready audience in Sophie, telling stories to her each night, with a couple of running narratives.\n\n\n\nSeven years after that life-transforming move, James says she is really enjoying life.\n\n\u201cAustralia is not a backdrop to me,\u201d she says, \u201cit\u2019s my home.\u201d\n\n\n\nAn American in Oz is published by Allen and Unwin.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Entertainment", "application-name": "The Sydney Morning Herald", "og": {"site_name": "The Sydney Morning Herald", "description": "A career move, life move from New York to the Macedon Ranges has been a big call for news professional Sara James.", "title": "The Bill, please: Lunch with Sara James, writer and broadcaster", "url": "http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/the-bill-please-lunch-with-sara-james-writer-and-broadcaster-20140602-zru1q.html", "image": "http://images.smh.com.au/2014/06/02/5476123/1402154141033.jpg.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@smh", "card": "summary"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "Open The Sydney Morning Herald", "robots": "ACAP allow-present prohibited-modification=annotation", "fb": {"app_id": 193677504039845}, "cXenseParse": {"ffx-assettype": "article", "ffx-assetid": 60085214}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.smh.com.au", "msvalidate.01": "3A0F8B0A5D246EFE15A2F9F975D1E623", "msapplication-task": "name=Weather;action-uri=http://www.smh.com.au/weather;icon-uri=http://www.smh.com.au/favicon.ico;", "description": "A career move, life move from New York to the Macedon Ranges has been a big call for news professional Sara James."}, "article_summary": "SARA JAMES AT SARA JAMES AT NIEUW AMSTERDAM Photo: KEN IRWINBut there was another enduring love.\nWhen she opened the fridge in the country clubhouse, the scene that confronted Sara James seemed innocuous enough.\nIt\u2019s not who she is, and it\u2019s not who our family is.\u201dSARA JAMES AT NIEUW AMSTERDAM Photo: Ken IrwinOf course, Sara James, reporting for NBC, was never far from the picture.\nIt\u2019s like their fault that I screwed up the sandwiches.\u201dSara James and Shane Green at Nieuw Amsterdam.\nGrits Fritters, Variety of sweetcorn, heirloom beetroots.at Nieuw Amsterdam Photo: Ken IrwinJames had built a formidable career in the US."}
