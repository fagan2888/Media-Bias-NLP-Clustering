The Attorney General and the state Health Department must deem them beneficial for the communities they serve before they are allowed to proceed.\n\nSome hospitals are banding together to create a formidable statewide footprint, such as the $5.4 billion deal between Robert Wood Johnson University Health and Barnabas.\n\nPrime Healthcare Services, a private, for-profit chain in Ontario, Calif. entered the largely nonprofit marketplace in New Jersey to snap up three of the last few remaining community medical centers. The last of those acquisitions, Saint Michael's Medical Center in Newark filed for bankruptcy on Aug. 10 to force the state to decide whether Prime should be allowed to buy and save it.\n\nRELATED: Mega-hospital merger in N.J. completed\n\nThe buying frenzy began in ernest in 2011, but it has intensified in the last 18 months. Driving the activity has been the Affordable Care Act, the landmark health care law also known as Obamacare, which penalizes hospitals for rapid patient admissions and rewards those that show they can keep people healthy and out of the hospital. The law is largely funded by a portion of Medicare funds hospitals counted on for reimbursement.\n\nSome studies have shown bigger hospital systems command bigger reimbursements from insurance companies, and end up driving up premiums costs. Hospital executives say they will be able to more easily save money on bulk purchasing and share expertise to benefit patients.\n\nMost hospital industry experts say to expect the trend to continue.\n\nSusan K.
