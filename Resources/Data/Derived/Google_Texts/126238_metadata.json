Wade, are for more than 70,000 individual plans that would take effect in 2016. The companies, requested increases and number of policyholders are as follows:\n\nAnthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield, 4.7 percent, 34,553 policyholders; ConnectiCare, 9.8 percent, 34,000 policyholders; and Golden Rule Insurance Co., 18.5 percent, 2,000 policyholders\n\nAll health insurance rates must be approved by the department but hearings are held at the discretion of the commissioner, who worked with state Healthcare Advocate Vicki Veltri to determine which requests would have hearings.\n\n\"The Department's actuarial review is rigorous and seeks to ensure that rates are adequate for the benefits offered and protects consumers' interests,\" Wade said in a department release Tuesday.\n\nConnecticut policyholders on the individual market could see increases that are low compared with many other states. In a story Friday, the New York Times reported increases ranging from 20 percent to 40 percent, as insurers cited populations seeking more medical care than the companies had anticipated.\n\nProfits for insurers are generally rising, however, in part because more people are covered. \"As increasing numbers of people obtain health insurance under the Affordable Care Act \u2014 many for the first time \u2014 it is essential that the public have greater opportunities to weigh in,\" Veltri said.\n\nThe hearings will begin at 9 a.m. on July 27 at the department's offices at 153 Market St. in the seventh-floor conference room.", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "State Sets Health Insurance Rate Hearings For Three Companies", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Hartford Courant", "author": "Hartford Courant", "og": {"site_name": "courant.com", "description": "HARTFORD \u2014 The state Insurance Department will hold hearings July 27 on health insurance rate increases for three companies with average requests ranging from 4.7 percent to 18.5 percent.", "title": "State Sets Health Insurance Rate Hearings For Three Companies", "url": "http://www.courant.com/business/hc-health-insurance-rate-hearings-20150707-story.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-5418224f/turbine/hc-hartford-default-fb-icon", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp07.14", "twitter": {"site": "@hartfordcourant", "card": "summary"}, "keywords": "Connecticut health insurance rate hearings, Katherine Wade, Anthem, ConnectiCare", "robots": "index,follow", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=391113483, app-argument=http://www.courant.com/deeplinkid/83947735", "fb": {"admins": 14500562, "page_id": 49693986601, "app_id": 152391743139}, "googlebot-news": "index", "date": "2015-07-07", "Description": "The Connecticut insurance rate hearings, ordered by Commissioner Katharine L.
