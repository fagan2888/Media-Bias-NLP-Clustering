Sara Tomic fell victim to ‘‘unfair’’ taunts about her older brother Bernard en route to a first-round exit from the Australian Open junior girls’ singles on Saturday.

Tomic, 15, lost 7-5 6-2 to her Thai doubles partner Kamonwan Buayam before admitting the heckling on court 20 was an unwanted distraction.

‘‘It was tough to be honest,’’ she said.

‘‘Had a few people there talking about my brother. I just try to keep thinking about me and the court.

‘‘They did support me but I think they’d been drinking a bit.

‘‘That’s life. You just have to get used to it.’’

Tomic idolises Bernard and described her painful experience watching his first-round withdrawal against world No.1 Rafael Nadal with a groin tear, after which the Australian was booed by spectators at Rod Laver Arena.

‘‘I was really worried at the time. I was at the point where I was going to cry,’’ she said.

‘‘Hopefully everything gets better and he stays healthy.’’

Tomic vowed to regroup for her junior doubles campaign with Buayam, saying she was confident they could challenge for the title.

‘‘I’ve always wanted to play with her, but she’s always had a partner,’’ the teenager said.

‘‘But we’re pretty good together.’’

Tomic said familiarity might have been a factor in losing her singles match to her good friend.

‘‘We know each other’s games well. Always against me, she always plays well,’’ she said.

‘‘She’s one of my closest friends in tennis. When we go on court, we’re not friends.

‘‘But she came over afterwards, gave me a hug.’’

While Tomic crashed out, fellow Australians Bradley Mousley, Harry Bourchier, Lizette Cabrera and Destanee Aiava won through to the second round of the juniors.
