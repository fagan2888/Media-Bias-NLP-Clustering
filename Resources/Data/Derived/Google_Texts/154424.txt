Kids attending schools on and around the Navajo and Hopi nations will have tens of thousands of new children’s books to choose from. Reader to Reader, a Massachusetts literacy organization, is donating 17,000 new books for kindergarten through 12th grade worth $200,000.

Gallup-McKinley County Public Schools, in Gallup, New Mexico; Central Consolidated Schools, in Shiprock, New Mexico; Ganado Unified School District, in Ganado, Arizona; and Hopi School District, in Keams Canyon, Arizona will be among the schools receiving books from the donation.

“We are pleased to make this large donation just before the holidays in order to get books into children’s hands that they can enjoy over winter vacation,” says David Mazor, founder and executive director of Reader of Reader, in a press release. “We had the option of donating these books to any school districts in the country, but we selected the districts that are on and near the Navajo and Hopi Nations as part of our ongoing support of literacy for Native children. We especially thank our partner Scholastic Inc. for the mountain of books they have donated.”

In the past decade, Reader to Reader has donated over $2.5 million in books, computers and school supplies to schools on and near the Navajo Nation and Hopi nations.

“We are so happy to be a recipient of Reader to Reader’s and Scholastic’s generosity. They are such an amazing organization that has had a profound impact on the children in our district,” says Mary Lindenmeyer, Library Media Coordinator for Gallup-McKinley County Schools, in a release.
