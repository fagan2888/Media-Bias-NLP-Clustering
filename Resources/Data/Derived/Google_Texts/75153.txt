Dian Upton and Pete Quatrochi were married Jan. 9, 1965 in Wichita, Kan., at Dian's family church, St. Joseph's.

The couple met in 1962 at the University of Kansas, where Pete was a business major and All-Big Eight Conference center for the Jayhawks football team. Dian was a radio-TV major in KU's William Allen White School of Journalism.

After graduation, Dian worked for the NBC TV Network in Wichita, Kan., and in Burbank, Calif., and Pete entered the United States Air Force, where he was an officer and a pilot in the Vietnam War.

While Pete was enlisted, the couple lived in Lubbock, Texas; Merced, Calif.; Fort Worth, Texas, and Granby, Mass.

They had three children and have five grandchildren.

Kristine, their daughter, was born and died in 1968. They have two sons. Philip (Ali), an attorney in Denver, who has two children, Cooper and Macy. Nicholas (Danielle), their youngest son, works with Pete in the family business in Boulder and has three daughters, Lyla, Nora and Mia.

Dian and Pete came to Boulder in 1972 for its outdoor lifestyle, university cultural events and the fact that it was a Big Eight Conference town. They have enjoyed countless visits from KU friends coming to games.

Pete is an avid fly fisherman and home gardener. Dian loves knitting and being available for friends, including the ones the couple have made with parents at Sacred Heart of Jesus School and Boulder High. Pete and Dian prize God and family above all else.

They celebrated with a champagne toast with family on Christmas Day, a second honeymoon to New Orleans last October and are planning an Alaskan cruise in 2015.
