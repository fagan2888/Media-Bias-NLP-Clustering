Analysts estimated $1.24.\n\nLowe\u2019s and Home Depot both have capitalized on years of housing-price gains, but Lowe\u2019s is struggling to execute as well its larger rival. Lowe\u2019s profit has now trailed analysts\u2019 projections in four of the last eight quarters, and Home Depot has missed only once in that time. In the second quarter, Lowe\u2019s sold more less-profitable items and didn\u2019t control expenses as well as analysts had expected.\n\n\u201cWe continue to favor Home Depot over Lowe\u2019s as the slight premium in valuation that Home Depot carries is more than justified by its superior sales performance and ability to better leverage expenses,\u201d Kate McShane, an analyst at Citigroup Inc., wrote in a note after the results were released.\n\nLowe\u2019s shares rose 0.4 percent to $73.28 at 11:48 a.m. in New York. The stock had gained 6.1 percent this year through Tuesday, compared with a 17 percent advance for Home Depot.\n\nMargin Shrinks\n\nLowe\u2019s gross margin, or the percentage of sales left after cost of goods sold, narrowed to about 34.48 percent in the second quarter from 34.55 percent a year earlier. Analysts had projected the measure would expand to 34.61 percent.\n\nThe reduced profitability was caused by more promotions on items like appliances, the company said. Last year, Lowe\u2019s decided to try to win market share in that category by increasing its discounts. The strategy has worked, with washer and dryers driving sales gains last quarter.\n\nSelling, general and administrative expenses at Lowe\u2019s were about 20.95 percent of sales in the quarter, down roughly 38 basis points from a year earlier. Citigroup\u2019s McShane had estimated they would drop by 53 basis points.\n\nThere were bright spots, too. Same-store sales, a key measure of growth because only established locations are counted, rose 4.3 percent in the quarter. That tops the 3.9 percent gain analysts had projected and surpassed Home Depot\u2019s 4.2 percent gain, marking the first time Lowe\u2019s beat its rival since 2009. The increase was driven by people taking on larger projects as purchases above $500 rose 9.3 percent.\n\n\u201cConsumers are more and more willing to invest in their home,\u201d Chief Executive Officer Robert Niblock said in an interview. \u201cTheir willingness to take their discretionary dollars and apply that to spending around their home continues to grow.\u201d\n\nLowe\u2019s also reiterated its annual forecast for earnings of $3.29 a share and same-store sales gaining 4 percent to 4.5 percent. Given that revenue by that measure advanced 4.7 percent in the first half, Lowe\u2019s is expecting a slowdown in the final two quarters of the year.\n\nHome Depot raised its earnings and sales forecasts on Tuesday.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Matt Townsend", "twitter": {"description": "Lowe\u2019s Cos. posted second-quarter profit that trailed analysts\u2019 estimates, showing that the home-improvement retailer isn\u2019t benefiting as much from the long expansion in housing prices as Home Depot Inc.", "title": "Lowe\u2019s Profit Misses Estimates as Retailer Lags Home Depot", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-08-19/lowe-s-profit-trails-analysts-estimates-as-sales-growth-slows", "image": "http://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/icvBvDQu9PsM/v5/-1x-1.jpg", "site": "@business", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-author": "Matt Townsend", "parsely-type": "post", "keywords": "Home Depot Inc/The,Lowe's Cos Inc", "news_keywords": "Home Depot Inc/The,Lowe's Cos Inc", "parsely-link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-08-19/lowe-s-profit-trails-analysts-estimates-as-sales-growth-slows", "parsely-title": "Lowe\u2019s Profit Misses Estimates as Retailer Lags Home Depot", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ff0000", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "parsely-pub-date": "2015-08-19T10:30:17.710Z", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "description": "Lowe\u2019s Cos. posted second-quarter profit that trailed analysts\u2019 estimates, showing that the home-improvement retailer isn\u2019t benefiting as much from the long expansion in housing prices as Home Depot Inc.", "parsely-tags": "Home Depot Inc/The,Lowe's Cos Inc,Region: Global,Page: article", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://assets.bwbx.io/business/public/images/favicons/mstile-144x144-bbd2101292.png", "date": "2015-08-19T10:30:17.710Z", "parsely-section": "industries", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "og": {"site_name": "Bloomberg.com", "description": "Lowe\u2019s Cos. posted second-quarter profit that trailed analysts\u2019 estimates, showing that the home-improvement retailer isn\u2019t benefiting as much from the long expansion in housing prices as Home Depot Inc.", "title": "Lowe\u2019s Profit Misses Estimates as Retailer Lags Home Depot", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-08-19/lowe-s-profit-trails-analysts-estimates-as-sales-growth-slows", "image": "http://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/icvBvDQu9PsM/v5/-1x-1.jpg", "type": "website"}, "fb": {"status": "Lowe\u2019s Cos. posted second-quarter profit that trailed analysts\u2019 estimates, showing that the home-improvement retailer isn\u2019t benefiting as much from the long expansion in housing prices as Home Depot Inc."}, "parsely-post-id": "NTBQZ6SYF05101", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "parsely-image-url": "http://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/icvBvDQu9PsM/v5/-1x-1.jpg"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc9aa\"", "article_summary": "Lowe\u2019s profit has now trailed analysts\u2019 projections in four of the last eight quarters, and Home Depot has missed only once in that time.\nLowe\u2019s and Home Depot both have capitalized on years of housing-price gains, but Lowe\u2019s is struggling to execute as well its larger rival.\nIn the second quarter, Lowe\u2019s sold more less-profitable items and didn\u2019t control expenses as well as analysts had expected.\nLowe\u2019s Cos. posted second-quarter profit that trailed analysts\u2019 estimates, showing that the home-improvement retailer isn\u2019t benefiting as much from the long expansion in housing prices as Home Depot Inc.Profit in the three months through July 31 was $1.20 a share, Mooresville, North Carolina-based Lowe\u2019s said Wednesday in a statement.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses at Lowe\u2019s were about 20.95 percent of sales in the quarter, down roughly 38 basis points from a year earlier."}
