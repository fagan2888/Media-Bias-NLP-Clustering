And if you\u2019re in the Bernie Sanders camp, that day could be coming. After a brutal thrashing in Tuesday\u2019s primaries, the self-described Democratic socialist told The New York Times that he plans on letting go hundreds of campaign workers prior to making a last stand in California. His campaign says they plan to go all the way to Philadelphia:\n\nThe Vermont senator revealed the changes a day after losing four of the five states that voted Tuesday and falling further behind Hillary Clinton in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination. Despite the changes, Mr. Sanders said he would remain in the race through the party\u2019s summer convention and stressed that he hoped to bring staff members back on board if his political fortunes improved.\n\n\u201cWe want to win as many delegates as we can, so we do not need workers now in states around country,\u201d Mr. Sanders said in the interview. \u201cWe don\u2019t need people right now in Connecticut. That election is over. We don\u2019t need them in Maryland. So what we are going to do is allocate our resources to the 14 contests that remain, and that means that we are going to be cutting back on staff.\u201d\n\n[\u2026]\n\nMr. Sanders said he planned to move a number of staff members to California, where he hoped to hold rallies for \u201chundreds of thousands\u201d of people in cities across that state.\n\n\u201cCalifornia will have the most staff,\u201d Mr. Sanders said. \u201cSymbolically and in terms of delegates, if we can win the largest state in this country, that will send a real message to the American people and to the delegates that this is a campaign that is moving in the direction it should.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Beginning of the end?.05/27/2016 5:12:55AM EST.", "author": "Matt Vespa", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Beginning of the end?", "title": "Uh Oh: Sanders Plans To Let Go Hundreds Of Campaign Workers", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/mattvespa/2016/04/27/uh-oh-sanders-to-let-go-hundreds-of-campaign-workers-n2154667", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2016/118/3b763a75-438b-4afd-99d5-360243f6724f.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Beginning of the end?", "title": "Uh Oh: Sanders Plans To Let Go Hundreds Of Campaign Workers", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/mattvespa/2016/04/27/uh-oh-sanders-to-let-go-hundreds-of-campaign-workers-n2154667", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2016/118/3b763a75-438b-4afd-99d5-360243f6724f.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Uh Oh: Sanders Plans To Let Go Hundreds Of Campaign Workers , Matt Vespa, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "\u201cCalifornia will have the most staff,\u201d Mr. Sanders said.\nAfter a brutal thrashing in Tuesday\u2019s primaries, the self-described Democratic socialist told The New York Times that he plans on letting go hundreds of campaign workers prior to making a last stand in California.\n\u201cWe want to win as many delegates as we can, so we do not need workers now in states around country,\u201d Mr. Sanders said in the interview.\nAnd if you\u2019re in the Bernie Sanders camp, that day could be coming.\nDespite the changes, Mr. Sanders said he would remain in the race through the party\u2019s summer convention and stressed that he hoped to bring staff members back on board if his political fortunes improved."}
