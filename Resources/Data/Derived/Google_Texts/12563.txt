A man carrying a hatchet is arrested at a South Walton Elementary School Saturday.

Walton County Sheriff's Deputy Steven Tector responded to Butler Elementary in reference to a suspicious person on school property.

Deputy Tector met with school teacher, Jamie Wright who said she was working and observed a white male riding a bicycle hanging out between two sheds on the backside of school property.
