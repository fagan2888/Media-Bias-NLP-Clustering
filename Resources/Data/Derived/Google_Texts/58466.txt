The Highway 80 Singer/Songwriter Festival is back in Meridian for its third year.

The festival took place in downtown Meridian in the Soule building, and featured guest speaker Alphonso Sanders. Sanders spoke to a crowd of local singer and songwriters about what it means to be a songwriter and what is expected from them in the music business.

"Music is a universal language, and we can speak to people that don't understand our words but the music will touch them in the heart and we can relate to folks that way," speaker Marty Gamblin says.

The Highway 80 festival stopped in newton last weekend, and Sanders says that he is hopeful the festival will one day extend all along Highway 80.
