Patent Owner had objected to Petitioner\u2019s declaration submitted with the Petition where the witness allegedly \u201cadmitted during his deposition that the opinions he presents in the [declaration] are not based on sufficient facts or data, are not the product of reliable principles and method, and are not reliably applied to the facts of this proceeding.\u201d\n\nPetitioner argued that Patent Owner\u2019s objections were untimely under 37 C.F.R. \u00a7 42.64(b)(1), \u201cwhich requires that any objection to evidence submitted during a preliminary proceeding (such as the Braasch Declaration) must be served within ten business days of the institution of the trial.\u201d Patent Owner responded \u201cthat its objections did not arise until Dr. Braasch\u2019s deposition, and that \u2018Section 42.64(b)(1) can only be met if the bases for objection are facially apparent in the evidence.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe Board agreed with Petitioner:\n\nIn this case, the Braasch Declaration was submitted with the Petition. Any objections to the Braasch Declaration, therefore, must have been served within ten business days of the decision instituting trial. 37 C.F.R. \u00a7 42.64(b)(1). Trial was instituted on May 14, 2015; as a consequence, Patent Owner\u2019s objections were almost three months late, and Patent Owner did not request that the Board waive or suspend the timing requirement prior to serving the late objections. Further, the alleged deficiencies in the Braasch Declaration should be addressed within the context of the weight given the testimony in view of Patent Owner\u2019s cross-examination of Dr. Braasch, as Patent Owner argues in the Patent Owner Response.\n\nThus, Petitioner\u2019s motion to strike Patent Owner\u2019s objections to Petitioner\u2019s evidence was granted.\n\nFactual Inc. v.
