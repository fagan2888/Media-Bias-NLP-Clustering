Steve Stockman (R-Texas) in the Republican primary against Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas).\n\nIn a new ad, Stovall sits in the bed of a pick-up truck with a golden retriever and equates Cornyn with Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.).\n\n\"As a U.S. senator from Texas, you vote for Texans, you don't stab her in the back by voting for cloture on Obamacare. You don't enslave it's children with unconstitutional laws and overwhelming debt. And you certainly don't do all this to please some guy that looks and fights like a turtle,\" Stovall says.\n\nMcConnell and Cornyn came under fire from conservatives for voting Wednesday to move forward legislation increasing the nation\u2019s borrowing limit.\n\n\"I'm a Texan.
