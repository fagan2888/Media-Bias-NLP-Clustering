It\u2019s not that I expect to have the day off, but maybe, just maybe, a little break?\n\nThis time around, though, I got something I didn\u2019t expect, congratulations from my younger daughter. As she recently started dabbling in social media, she instantly \u201cliked\u201d my post-race photo on Instagram before I was even in the car on the way home.\n\nThe minute I walked in the door, she was ready with a compliment: \u201cWay to go Mommy and Daddy. Congratulations on running 13.1 miles. You did it!\u201d\n\nShe gave us each a hug and then went back to Facetiming a friend. When we walked in, she went on to proudly explain to her friend that we had just returned from a race.\n\nWhether or not my girls turn out to be runners (so far they have not been too keen on the idea), I hope that the example I am setting is not just one of a healthy lifestyle, but an example of perseverance, that you can do anything you put your mind to.\n\nTwelve years ago, if anyone would have told me I could run 13.1 miles, I would have said they were crazy. But, each time I do it now, I think about the example my mother set for me. No, she wasn\u2019t a runner, far from it, but she did do things that inspired me.\n\nShe got a scholarship to Duke as young woman from a small town in North Carolina. She went to law school in her late 30s while raising two children. And she worked hard at something she loved almost right up until the day she died.\n\nSo, it\u2019s not about running. It\u2019s about having a goal and reaching it. Hopefully, I am teaching my girls just that. I\u2019ve got to run now \u2014 taking one to dance and then heading to the grocery store.\n\nAmanda is the mom of two, a reporter for WRAL-TV and the author of several books including three on motherhood.
