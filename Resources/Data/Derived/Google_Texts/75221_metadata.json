Miami-Dade has the highest number of uninsured in the state.\n\nAbout 600,000 Floridians either make a little too much money to qualify for Medicaid under current rules, or not enough to qualify for an Obamacare subsidy.\n\nLast year the state House and Governor Rick Scott ignored pleas from the state Senate, health care advocates and medical professionals to accept the Medicaid dollars to offset disappearing LIP money. Ostensibly, the rationale for rejecting the money was the possibility that the feds (or Congress under a Republican president) would torpedo Obamacare, leaving the state solely responsible for covering the uninsured. It\u2019s unclear where that money is going to come from now.\n\n\u201cCounty officials are really going to have to figure out how to provide care to low-income, uninsured residents with decreased LIP funding and other sources of safety net funding that, in the past, have gone to the counties, and that the counties have relied on that will no longer be coming into the counties,\u201d said Charlotte Cassel, Equal Justice Works Fellow with Florida Legal Services.\n\nCritics accuse House leadership and the governor of playing politics, essentially trying to make Obamacare look bad by not letting the program roll out as the feds intended. Some are also concerned about what will happen to the health care industry and the economy as a whole if the state doesn\u2019t accept the money.\n\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t take care of people, basically, they can\u2019t participate in our community,\u201d said Dena Gross-Leavengood, health care committee chair for the League of Women Voters of Hillsborough County. \u201cThey can\u2019t help the economy. They can\u2019t work if they\u2019re not healthy, and if they\u2019re not healthy they can\u2019t take care of their children.\u201d\n\nPlus, she said, if hospitals aren\u2019t reimbursed for caring for the poor and uninsured, they won\u2019t be able to hire as many people.\n\n\u201cIf you think you wait long in the emergency room now, you wait until they have to cut back on the emergency room staff,\u201d Gross-Leavengood said.\n\nHillsborough County is unique in the state in that it has a half-cent sales tax that funds a health care program for low-income residents. But without the LIP money to bolster the county\u2019s efforts, the program could erode.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a big deal. It\u2019s a really big deal,\u201d Gross-Leavengood said.\n\nLevine-Cava hopes there\u2019ll be a silver lining when the cuts come \u2014 that state officials will see what impact they have on the community and reverse course on Medicaid expansion. But given Scott\u2019s attitude toward the hospitals that provide safety net care, she\u2019s not optimistic. Scott is a former for-profit hospital chain exec who has accused hospitals that receive LIP money, many of which are nonprofits, of trying to protect their revenues.\n\n\u201cTruthfully, I did think that the hospitals\u2019 pain would help move this agenda item, but\u2026 the governor has also taken aim at hospitals like Jackson [Health System], which is our largest system, and basically is telling them that they are collecting more revenue than they need,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd so he\u2019s not really providing much sympathy for the struggles of the hospitals that meet the needs for uncompensated care.\u201d\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "It might be best described as a perfect storm for health care in Florida, and those who tried to fight against it are watching it approach in slow motion....", "og": {"site_name": "Creative Loafing: Tampa Bay", "image": "http://r2.cltampa.com/files/base/scomm/cltampa/image/2016/01/960w/news_dena_leavengood_by_alex_pickett.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "It might be best described as a perfect storm for health care in Florida, and those who tried to fight against it are watching it approach in slow motion....", "title": "No more LIP: Florida\u2019s counties may soon be ill-equipped to care for many uninsured"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "google-site-verification": "7ehqC5TVlujj_KkCw_cMXSyKukkqxKv9SOkcxE1CbCI", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "No more LIP: Florida\u2019s counties may soon be ill-equipped to care for many uninsuredIt might be best described as a perfect storm for health care in Florida, and those who tried to fight against it are watching it approach in slow motion.\nBut without the LIP money to bolster the county\u2019s efforts, the program could erode.\nLast year the state House and Governor Rick Scott ignored pleas from the state Senate, health care advocates and medical professionals to accept the Medicaid dollars to offset disappearing LIP money.\nScott is a former for-profit hospital chain exec who has accused hospitals that receive LIP money, many of which are nonprofits, of trying to protect their revenues.\nHillsborough County is unique in the state in that it has a half-cent sales tax that funds a health care program for low-income residents."}
