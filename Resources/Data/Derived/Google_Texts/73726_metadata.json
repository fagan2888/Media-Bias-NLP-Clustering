Well they were responding to C-SPAN\u2019s childish questions. They asked inappropriate questions, like: \"Respond to Trump\u2019s accusation about Fiorina: 'Look at that face. Would anyone vote for a president with that face?\u2019\" They did not get a chance to articulate their positions on the economy, foreign policy, immigration, etc.\n\nNow we know what liberals want. Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act is not affordable. Ask moderate income people how affordable it is. Their deductibles are too expensive. The cost of it is much higher than their former insurance companies. Liberals have to lie to get their policies through; for instance: \"If you like your doctor you can keep your doctor.\" \"If you like your insurance plan, you can keep it.\"\n\nNo, Anne, we do not want universal health coverage. We do not want another liberal/socialist president. Republicans do have a plan. Part of that plan is to open up the affordable insurance companies in one state to other states. Competition is good.\n\nThe Obama presidency on immigrants has become a complete disaster. Why is the flow of immigrants to America at zero? There are no jobs here. They are going back to Mexico for that. Open up the environmentally sound Keystone pipeline, then Americans will become employed. And the illegal immigrants will flood our land again.\n\nThe illegal immigrants now are costing the American citizens a great deal of our taxes. American and Hispanic immigrant citizens are being denied such amenities and necessities. Why do Democrats aid illegal immigrants? They are potential voters to the Democratic Party, thus Democrats will be in power in perpetuity.\n\nRight now we need a Republican president to straighten out the mess our country and the world are in.\n\nI am keeping my eye on Cruz, Rubio, Carson and Fiorina.\n\nFlorence Nystedt\n\nTamworth", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.conwaydailysun.com/opinion/letters/122632-florence-nystedt-liberals-don-t-want-a-republican-debate-on-the-issues", "site_name": "Conway Live Server -", "type": "article", "title": "Florence Nystedt: Liberals don\u2019t want a Republican debate on the issues"}, "description": "The Daily Sun newspapers are strong, independent voices in their communities and deliver reliable local news to readers and excellent value\r\nto advertisers.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2.0"}, "article_summary": "Right now we need a Republican president to straighten out the mess our country and the world are in.\nThe illegal immigrants now are costing the American citizens a great deal of our taxes.\n\"If you like your insurance plan, you can keep it.\"\nPart of that plan is to open up the affordable insurance companies in one state to other states.\nAnd the illegal immigrants will flood our land again."}
