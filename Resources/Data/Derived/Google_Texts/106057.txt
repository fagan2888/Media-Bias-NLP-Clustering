Federal officials have been quietly developing the regulatory nuts and bolts to support two little-known Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) health plan programs: the Multi-State Plan (MSP) program and the Basic Health Program (BHP).

Drafters of the 2010 law created the MSP program to give consumers a coverage option somewhat similar to Federal Employees' Health Benefit Program coverage.
