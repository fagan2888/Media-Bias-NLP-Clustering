Some of his supposed \u201cgaffes\u201d such as the clickbait rabid dog comment were more offensive to the media than they probably are to his base. But his strange and often confusing answers on foreign policy questions \u2013 not just on ISIS and what\u2019s going on in France but around the rest of Europe and Asia \u2013 seem to be taking a toll. It\u2019s difficult to measure at this point on such a fine grain question, but Politico\u2019s insider survey is turning up town hall attendees and others who are supportive of Carson but who are now saying things like, he doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s talking about. Nobody seems to like him any less or doubt his sincerity, but this latest turn of events may be showing one of his weakest points in this race. Even in Iowa it just feels like there\u2019s been some erosion.\n\nIndeed, they said the terrorist attacks have reordered the candidates in their mind, lifting Cruz and Sen. Marco Rubio and, for many, making Carson an afterthought. \u201cHe\u2019s a great guy, he\u2019s fun to listen to, but I didn\u2019t hear anything substantive,\u201d said Alan Hilgerson, a Des Moines-based physician who said national security is an \u201cextremely high\u201d priority for him as he considers the 2016 contenders vying for Iowa. Of Carson, he continued, \u201cI don\u2019t know that I\u2019d want him as my president.\u201d Worse yet for Carson, at the Family Leader Forum organized by social-conservative icon Bob Vander Plaats, voters said the more they thought about Carson\u2019s foreign policy credentials, the less comfortable they were with him.\n\nAt various events around the state, other observers are running into the same thing. McKay Coppins reports from a candidate forum in Des Moines with a similar result.\n\nAsked which candidate most impressed her after the forum concluded, Jan Swinton \u2014 who traveled two hours from the southern Iowa town of Fairfield to see the contenders live \u2014 enthusiastically rattled off the names of several Republicans. She was dazzled by Marco Rubio\u2019s confident command of the issues; attracted by Carly Fiorina\u2019s eloquence; struck by Ted Cruz\u2019s nerve. What about Carson? Swinton emitted a reluctant chuckle, and then sighed wistfully. \u201cI really like Ben,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s really smart.\u201d She thought for a moment, and then offered up another virtue. \u201cIf you read his stuff, it\u2019s the best stuff.\u201d But? \u201cWhen you see him in person he just doesn\u2019t bring it on. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s gonna be quick enough and firm enough \u2026 He\u2019s a nice guy, but I don\u2019t know if he can be president.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s very little to go on in terms of the polling. Nobody of national scope has polled Iowa since the November 3rd CNN/ORC numbers. The poll of polls average still has him behind Trump, but not by all that much. Still, NBC put out a new post-attack set of national numbers Friday night which may be mirrored to a certain extent in Iowa, at least in terms of momentum. And those numbers don\u2019t look good for Carson, while Cruz and Rubio seem to be benefiting the most.\n\nIn the Republican primary race, the newest NBC News/SurveyMonkey online poll shows Donald Trump has the frontrunner spot to himself, with 28% support among Republican and independent voters who lean Republican. Support for Ben Carson, who was tied with Trump in last month\u2019s online poll, has fallen off by 8 points and the former neurosurgeon is now tied with Ted Cruz at 18%. Trailing not too far behind is Marco Rubio, at 11%. The next tier of candidates has a lot of catching up to do, with Jeb Bush at 4% and Chris Christie and Carly Fiorina each with 3%.\n\nThe only other fresh numbers we have were still pre-Paris, from the period ending November 16th. It\u2019s done by Morning Consult, too, so I\u2019m not sure how much weight to throw it. Still, they had Trump at 28 and Carson down to 17.\n\nI\u2019m not in the camp of those who want to call the neurosurgeon \u201cincredibly dumb\u201d or anything approaching it, but the more I hear him talk about foreign policy the less I\u2019m finding him looking terribly presidential. And at this moment in time people seem to be very, very concerned about ISIS, protecting the nation and all of the machinery that entails. Iowa\u2019s evangelicals clearly love Ben Carson, but that\u2019s the same voting block which tends to flock toward strength when it comes to questions of war and peace or countering terrorism. We\u2019ll need a good set of data from a reliable source taken this week or next to be sure but I won\u2019t be terribly shocked if Iowa follows the latest national numbers we\u2019re seeing and Carson sinks downward a bit.\n\nNow for the sixty-four dollar question: if the bloom is truly coming off of Carson\u2019s rose, where do his supporters go? There was definitely one school of thought which said that they would migrate to the other big, complete outsider in the race. That was the worst case scenario for the establishment because if Trump gathered up Carson\u2019s flock we could pretty much just move to the convention now and nominate The Donald. But if the early NBC figures provide any sort of a hint, Carson sinking may actually wind up benefiting Ted Cruz a lot more. That would make for an interesting holiday break heading into the final stretch in January before voting begins.\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "Slippage", "title": "Has Carson lost his grip on Iowa at this point?", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2015/11/22/has-carson-lost-his-grip-on-iowa-at-this-point/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary", "creator": "@JazzShaw"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "keywords": "Ben Carson, Donald Trump, foreign policy, GOP primary, Iowa, Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz, terror attack,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-11-22T16:01:17+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-11-22T11:59:45+00:00"}, "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "article_summary": "Has Carson lost his grip on Iowa at this point?\nAnd those numbers don\u2019t look good for Carson, while Cruz and Rubio seem to be benefiting the most.\nStill, NBC put out a new post-attack set of national numbers Friday night which may be mirrored to a certain extent in Iowa, at least in terms of momentum.\nBut his strange and often confusing answers on foreign policy questions \u2013 not just on ISIS and what\u2019s going on in France but around the rest of Europe and Asia \u2013 seem to be taking a toll.\nBut if the early NBC figures provide any sort of a hint, Carson sinking may actually wind up benefiting Ted Cruz a lot more."}
