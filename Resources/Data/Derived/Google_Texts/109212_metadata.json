The program is an option under the federal Affordable Care Act, with funding provided by the federal government.\n\nNY State of Health, the state's online insurance market, sent invitations Friday to private insurers to participate in BHP. Consumers with income at or below 150 percent of the federal poverty level ($17,655 for a household of one, or $36,375 for a household of four) will pay no monthly premium. Those with slightly higher incomes at 200 percent of the federal poverty level ($23,540 for a household of one, or $48,500 for a household of four) will pay $20 a month.\n\nMore Information\n\nAll health policies offered through the program must offer the same minimum set of benefits as other plans on the online exchange.\n\nThe state will administer BHP and pay premiums to participating insurance companies. The federal government will reimburse the state at 95 percent of the value of the subsidies that individuals would have received if they had purchased insurance on NY State of Health without the new program, according to Donna Frescatore, executive director of the exchange.\n\nThe BHP is intended to make coverage available to people who find the cost of health insurance challenging, even with the subsidies provided through NY State of Health. It is also intended to address the problem of \"churning,\" the term given for people who disqualify for their insurance coverage when their income changes.\n\nFrescatore said she hopes insurers that already offer policies on the exchange will also choose to participate in BHP.\n\n\"It gives consumers the ability to stay with the same health plan should they experience changes in income,\" she said.\n\nchughes@timesunion.com \u2022 518-454-5417 \u2022 @hughesclaire", "article_metadata": {"SKYPE_TOOLBAR": "SKYPE_TOOLBAR_PARSER_COMPATIBLE", "description": "NY State of Health, the state's online insurance market, sent invitations Friday to private insurers to participate in BHP.
