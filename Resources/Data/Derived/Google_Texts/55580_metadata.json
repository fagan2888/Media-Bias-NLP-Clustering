There was the abortion bill they introduced and then pulled over language concerning rape victims. They did pass the Keystone XL bill, which will be vetoed \u2014 and their timing wasn\u2019t great, given that with gas at $2 a gallon, people aren\u2019t feeling a desperate need for Canadian tar sands oil. Their alternate plans for immigration and health care are nowhere to be seen.\n\nNow look at the news just from the last day or two. Republicans tried to pass a bill to fund the Department of Homeland Security and repeal President Obama\u2019s executive actions on immigration. Senate Democrats filibustered it, and in its current form it\u2019s dead, meaning we\u2019re headed for another shutdown mini-crisis. Spoiler alert: Republicans will lose, caving in and funding the department. Then the House took its 56th vote to repeal Obamacare, and as Dana Milbank reports, even Republicans themselves can\u2019t get excited about that. \u201cFor much of the debate Tuesday afternoon, no more than a dozen seats were occupied on the pro-repeal side of the House. More than once, the GOP had nobody available to speak.\u201d\n\nThe House of Representatives voted to repeal the Affordable Care Act on Tuesday. The action now moves to the Senate, where Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) introduced legislation for the full repeal on Monday. (Reuters)\n\nOh, and one of their new star senators made news by stating that restaurant workers shouldn\u2019t have to wash their hands after going to the bathroom.\n\nIt\u2019s quite a record of accomplishment. What wonders will their second month in power bring forth to improve Americans\u2019 lives?\n\nIn fairness, with a Democratic president there really isn\u2019t much that a Republican Congress can achieve unless it\u2019s willing to compromise, which this Congress isn\u2019t. But after six years of waiting for the moment they\u2019d take complete control, you\u2019d think they\u2019d have some kind of plan. If they do, it\u2019s hard to discern how it\u2019s supposed to work. Every conflict they have with the president only seems to make them look worse, and they seem to be lurching from day to day with no idea how to do anything but fall on their faces.\n\nIronically, the Republicans had a lot more power when they were in the minority than they do now. With a Democratic Congress, the administration set out an ambitious legislative agenda, which Republicans were able to obstruct and subvert as long as they stayed unified, which they did very well. But once they took control, the administration all but gave up on legislating (apart from unavoidable tasks like passing budgets to keep the government open), which leaves Republicans with no fights to wage apart from the meaningless ones they manage to concoct on their own. And they can\u2019t even figure out how to win those. Winning Congress has put Republicans in a position where they have little choice other than to make things worse.\n\nNevertheless, there are still 23 months left in this Congress. There will be opportunities for Republicans to make practical gains, and maybe even improve their image along the way. They could come to an agreement with President Obama on infrastructure spending, which everyone used to agree is absolutely necessary. They could make tough but realistic demands on the budget, and pass something that Obama will be willing to sign but still manages to move government\u2019s priorities in the direction they\u2019d like \u2014 even if tea partiers call it a betrayal, because tea partiers will call any compromise a betrayal. If the Supreme Court rules in their favor in King v. Burwell and takes insurance subsidies from millions of people, they could be ready with a plan to help them immediately, instead of just celebrating the fact that they successfully made so many Americans\u2019 lives worse.\n\nAll that could happen. But based on their first month with control of Congress, does anyone think it will? Or will each new controversy only show them to be unable to reconcile their internal disagreements or achieve anything tangible for their own supporters? Unlike some issues that pop up unexpectedly, those are debates and hurdles everyone can see coming. And I\u2019ll bet Republicans still don\u2019t have a plan for them.", "article_metadata": {"description": "After waiting for six years to take over, Republicans seem to have no plan at all.", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "After waiting for six years to take over, Republicans seem to have no plan at all.", "title": "Is it too early to call the new GOP Congress a failure?", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/02/04/is-it-too-early-to-call-the-new-gop-congress-a-failure/", "image": "https://images.washingtonpost.com/?url=http://img.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/files/2012/12/mcconnell1.jpg&w=1484&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@paulwaldman1"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/02/04/is-it-too-early-to-call-the-new-gop-congress-a-failure/", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "congressional republicans, congressional gop, obama, 114th Congress, king v burwell, obamacare, mitch mcconnell, john boehner, affordable care act, tax credits, obamacare subsidies, obamacare exchanges", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "congressional republicans, congressional gop, obama, 114th Congress, king v burwell, obamacare, mitch mcconnell, john boehner, affordable care act, tax credits, obamacare subsidies, obamacare exchanges"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda154\"", "article_summary": "Is it too early to call the GOP-run 114th Congress a failure?\nRepublicans tried to pass a bill to fund the Department of Homeland Security and repeal President Obama\u2019s executive actions on immigration.\nIn fairness, with a Democratic president there really isn\u2019t much that a Republican Congress can achieve unless it\u2019s willing to compromise, which this Congress isn\u2019t.\nBut based on their first month with control of Congress, does anyone think it will?\nWinning Congress has put Republicans in a position where they have little choice other than to make things worse."}
