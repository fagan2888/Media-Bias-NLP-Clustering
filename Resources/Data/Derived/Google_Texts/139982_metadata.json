Sniffling, feverish patients cram waiting rooms during this sickly season, which occurs in the fall and winter and peaks in January and February. The steady expansion and popularity of retail clinics has provided an alternative to the long waits at doctors\u2019 offices for those seeking influenza immunization or treatment of the flu.Flu shots have been in use on a national scale since 1976; they are highly recommended in the health care industry. In fact, the accessibility and promotion of the flu shot seems to have skyrocketed in recent years: in 2009, 94% of all vaccination visits at retail clinics were to obtain an influenza vaccination, for a total of 1.8 million flu shots.Retail clinics give the masses an additional location at which they can receive the flu vaccine. Nurse practitioners or physician assistants treat patients at these retail clinics and are able to administer a variety of vaccinations to patients at a low cost\u2014even no cost with some insurance plans.Receiving a seasonal flu shot at the right time ensures its efficacy throughout the flu season. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends getting the flu shot in early autumn, preferably before October.As a result, retail clinic visits spike during fall, a side effect of flu season preparation, according to a study published in the medical journal Health Affairs.Why are so many people getting their flu shots at retail clinics? Affordability and convenience are the chief reasons. Retail clinics accept most insurance plans, and the Affordable Care Act requires most preventive services, including flu shots, to be provided without cost. If an individual does not have health insurance and is paying out-ofpocket, however, the price of a flu shot at a retail clinic is likely to be lower than at a primary care physician\u2019s office. Depending on what type of influenza immunization a patient chooses, costs range from $25 to $50 at retail clinics. In regard to accessibility, retail clinics have extended hours and accept patients on a walk-in basis, making getting a flu shot just another errand that can easily be accomplished at any time\u2014without the long wait at a doctor\u2019s office.For neighborhoods without a retail clinic, pharmacists can administer a seasonal flu shot to children aged 7 and older. Pharmacies also accept a wide array of insurances and offer low-cost flu shots for those without health insurance.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Retail,Clinic,Flu,Shot,", "description": "Retail clinics provide an alternative to long waits at doctors' offices during flu season."}, "article_summary": "Retail Clinics: Helping to Fight the FluKatrina RossosEvery season has its telltale signs: with spring, comes blossoming flowers; with fall, it\u2019s a slight nip in the air; and with the dreaded flu season, there are chills, fatigue, and body aches.\nPharmacies also accept a wide array of insurances and offer low-cost flu shots for those without health insurance.\nRetail clinics accept most insurance plans, and the Affordable Care Act requires most preventive services, including flu shots, to be provided without cost.\nDepending on what type of influenza immunization a patient chooses, costs range from $25 to $50 at retail clinics.\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends getting the flu shot in early autumn, preferably before October.As a result, retail clinic visits spike during fall, a side effect of flu season preparation, according to a study published in the medical journal Health Affairs.Why are so many people getting their flu shots at retail clinics?"}
