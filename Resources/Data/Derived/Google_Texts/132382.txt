Airlines reportedly canceled 2,806 flights on Friday in anticipation of a blizzard that has been forecast to pound Washington, D.C., and points northeast.

The website FlightAware.com said another 3,295 were delayed because of the storm, which has been dubbed Winter Storm Jonas. The blizzard is projected to dump as much as two feet of snow on the capital area.

Another 2,745 flights have already been canceled for Saturday and 38 have been canceled for Sunday, according to the website.

Airlines said they are erring on the side of caution.

"You can rebook without penalty," American Airlines tweeted:

#Jonas is affecting flights at CLT, DCA, JFK, LGA, PHL & most Northeast US airports. You can rebook without penalty: https://t.co/kNkPUiCR67 — American Airlines (@AmericanAir) January 21, 2016

"Impacted airports by #Jonas have reduced or no service in the coming days," the company continued in a follow-up tweet. "Check flight status before you travel."

The leading airport for cancellations on Friday was Charlotte/Douglas International Airport, which had 397 outgoing and 390 inbound flights cancelled.

Washington, D.C.’s Ronald Reagan National, Baltimore's Thurgood Marshall International, Raleigh/Durham International and Washington's Dulles International airports rounded out the top five on the outgoing flight cancellation list on Friday.
