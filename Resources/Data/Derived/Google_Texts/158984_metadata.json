The raises will cost the county about $1.6 million.\n\nThe county also has more than tripled the amount of general fund money it will spend on building maintenance and improvements. And the budget includes an increase in spending on replacing equipment and technology, such as sheriff\u2019s cruisers.\n\n\u201cThis is a good year, and we\u2019ve had some tough years in the last few years \u2026 and now we\u2019re able to do some things that we\u2019ve been putting off, which is really important,\u201d said Debbie Lieberman, president of the Montgomery County Board of Commissioners.\n\nAdditionally, the county for the first time in 15 years will increase operating line-item expenses for consulting agreements, professional services and office necessities.\n\n\u201cWe have not invested this kind of money since before the recession,\u201d said Joe Tuss, Montgomery County administrator.\n\nThe general fund, which accounts for about one-fifth of the county\u2019s total appropriation, will increase $8.9 million from 2015.\n\nThe \u201call funds\u201d budget will increase 2.1 percent to $821.4 million. That budget includes millions of dollars in state and federal grants, levy funds, fees from the water and sewer divisions and other sources.\n\nNext year will be the fourth consecutive that the county will increase wages.\n\nThe economy continues to improve and revenue has bounced back, and the raises bring compensation up to reasonable and fair levels that allow the county to remain competitive in the marketplace so as to attract and keep skilled workers, said Tuss.\n\nThe recession forced the county to \u201cright-size\u201d itself through reductions in staffing and expenditures, and today the organization prioritizes financial discipline while providing citizens with the level of services they expect and deserve, Tuss said.\n\nThe total number of budgeted county positions for next year is 4,375, which is up 32 from this year. The general fund has 1,322 budgeted positions.\n\nSales tax receipts have increased steadily since the downturn and are expected to rise next year to $80.5 million, up 3 percent from the 2015 estimate and 9 percent from 2014. Sales taxes account for almost 55 percent of general fund revenue.\n\nConsumers are spending more, and local retailers are seeing higher sales activity.\n\nChanges under the Affordable Care Act expanded eligibility for and use of managed care services, which are taxable and have boosted receipts.\n\nAlthough sales taxes are rising, the county next year projects flat revenue from property taxes and real estate fees. Investment income is expected to fall while local government funding is anticipated to see a slight uptick.\n\n\u201cThank goodness our sales tax have bounced back, because if our sales tax receipts had the same trend line as all of these other revenue streams, we would be in a serious situation,\u201d Tuss said.\n\nGeneral fund personnel costs are set at $91.3 million, which includes wages, benefits and retirement contributions.\n\nPersonnel accounts for more than 60 percent of general fund expenditures.\n\nGeneral fund operating expenses will increase 2.5 percent next year for the first time since around the turn of the century.\n\nThe increase will cost the county about $1.1 million and will bring operating line expenditures to $56.7 million.\n\nOperating allocations pay for office supplies, furniture, equipment and contractual professional services, said Tim Nolan, the county\u2019s director of management and budget.\n\nCounty departments hire consultants for some work, such as architectural services or website updates.\n\nSome county offices still use computers that run on Windows 98, officials said.\n\nIn addition, the county plans to spend $3.4 million on replacement capital, including data processing equipment, furniture and computer systems. The county allocated a little more than $2 million for this purpose in 2015.\n\nThe county plans to buy 20 new cruisers for the sheriff\u2019s department in 2016. The county bought five vehicles this year.\n\nThe county also plans to spend $1.2 million for a server virtualization project that will upgrade the hardware and should reduce maintainence costs, officials said.\n\nSpending on building repairs and maintenance will more than triple to about $3.3 million.\n\nThe county said it has 20 to 30 projects that will target roofs, crumbling concrete on the exterior of buildings and antiquated systems including plumbing and air-handling units.\n\n\u201cAll of our buildings are aged,\u201d Nolan said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Montgomery County approved a $148 million budget Thursday.", "author": "By Cornelius Frolik - Staff Writer", "og": {"url": "http://www.mydaytondailynews.com/news/news/local-govt-politics/county-budget-increases-spending-on-wages-investme/npgqw/", "image": "http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/img/photos/2014/08/21/2e/93/MY_DDN_Facebook_Icon.png", "type": "article", "description": "Montgomery County approved a $148 million budget Thursday.", "title": "Montgomery County budget increases spending on wages, investment"}, "twitter": {"description": "Citing stable finances, Montgomery County next year plans to give its workers raises and increase spending on building repairs, capital purchases and operating line items.", "card": "summary", "title": "County budget increases spending on wages, repairs"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "myddn", "vr": {"canonical": "http://www.mydaytondailynews.com/news/news/local-govt-politics/county-budget-increases-spending-on-wages-investme/npgqw/"}, "cmg_revpath": "/re/292/3169198/news/news/local-govt-politics/county-budget-increases-spending-on-wages-investme/npgqw/", "keywords": "politics,dayton,local,community", "viewport": "shrink-to-fit=no, width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Montgomery County commissioners on Thursday approved a $148 million general fund budget for 2016, which is a 6.4 percent increase from 2015.\nRelated UPDATE on 2016 Montgomery County budgetThe county will give workers a 2.5 percent wage increase, just as it did in 2015.\nThe county also has more than tripled the amount of general fund money it will spend on building maintenance and improvements.\nThe budget growth is possible because of a projected increase in sales tax revenue and, to a much lesser degree, fees and charges for services.\nGeneral fund personnel costs are set at $91.3 million, which includes wages, benefits and retirement contributions."}
