Tom Udall, New Mexico Democrat, actually found its way into the Constitution?\n\nWe know what supporters say. This amendment will allow Congress to \u201ccontrol billionaires\u2019 ability to buy elections.\u201d We know what opponents say. As the American Civil Liberties Union put it, the Udall Amendment will \u201cfundamentally \u2018break\u2019 the Constitution and endanger civil rights and civil liberties for generations.\u201d\n\nWe also know the true reason this amendment is being proposed. Senate Democrats are holding a vote because they think it is a winning political issue this election season. Since this is a just political game, we know that the amendment has no chance today of making into the Constitution.\n\nPolitical winds change, though. What if one day the Udall Amendment became part of our founding document? What would be the real effects?\n\nThe most common refrain from supporters of the amendment is that it would \u201coverturn Citizens United.\u201d That\u2019s partially right. This amendment would actually overturn every Supreme Court ruling in the past 40 years that protected our right to criticize and speak out about our elected officials, including Citizens United. But while some on the left have demonized the Citizens United decision as allowing unlimited corporate money, secret money and foreign money into our elections (it does none of these things), the actual facts of the case are that the federal government thought it had the power to ban a political movie.\n\nIllustration on ramifications of the Udall Amendment proposal by Alexander Hunter/The Washington ... more >\n\nThe government\u2019s position, quite explicitly, is that it was allowed to ban a documentary (\u201cHillary: The Movie\u201d) from appearing on paid cable TV because it spoke about a politician within 60 days of an election, and the nonprofit conservative group that made the movie (Citizens United) was a corporation. This case could just as readily have been about a Michael Moore documentary released by his production company critical of Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney in September 2012, or a Paramount political thriller in which the characters mention who they are voting for, released in late October of an election year. The government\u2019s position would remain the same: It could ban the films for mentioning these political candidates.\n\nThat is what the Udall Amendment authorizes Congress to do. The explicit effect of \u201coverturning Citizens United\u201d would be to allow the federal government to ban movies that malign (or praise) incumbent politicians and their challengers running for office.\n\nMore frightening still are the arguments the government made advocating for this radical position. Deputy Solicitor General, Malcolm L. Stewart was asked during oral arguments in Citizens United to consider a scenario where a single sentence of a 500-page book advocated for a candidate. He responded, \u201cwe [the government] could prohibit publication of the book.\u201d That statement caused such a stir that a second round of oral arguments was scheduled, and Elena Kagan, then solicitor general, walked back the book-banning claim. Her new argument, however, found that a \u201cpolitical pamphlet\u201d could be banned. She made no mention of how to distinguish between a political pamphlet and a book.\n\nWhen supporters argue that this amendment will \u201coverturn Citizens United,\u201d know that these are the facts that they are talking about. This is the power that Congress would actually have, should this alteration to the Constitution ever occur. This is the real effect of the Udall Amendment.\n\nAdvocates of the Udall Amendment have said that they have no intention of banning books. Their goal, they argue, is only to keep \u201cevil corporations\u201d from unduly influencing our elections. However, that is absolutely not what the genuine consequence of the constitutional change would be. Citizens United is not the evil villain some Americans picture when they are thinking about \u201ccorporate America.\u201d It is a not-for-profit organization funded overwhelmingly by individuals who happen to agree with each other on political issues. It is a group of Americans engaging in the most essential form of democracy \u2014 voicing their opinions about challengers, incumbents and the hot-button political arguments of the day.\n\nThese are the people this constitutional amendment will silence. It is an amendment to allow Congress to ban any media \u2014 film or pamphlet, book or TV ad \u2014 produced by individuals who join together specifically to argue their political perspective. Incumbent politicians will get to write the rules governing which Americans can voice their opposition to incumbent politicians.\n\nWe may abhor the messages of our political opponents; we may think they are the lowest form of political garbage; we may fight with every breath to dispute their claims, discredit their sources and denounce their content.\n\nHowever, we should not \u2014 even as a political stunt \u2014 vote to change the Constitution to give the government the power to ban their political speech.\n\nScott Blackburn is a research fellow at the Center for Competitive Politics.", "article_metadata": {"description": "What would happen to political speech if the constitutional amendment proposed by Sen.
