Copy may not be in its final form.\n\nNERMEEN SHAIKH: Here in New York and in most other states, a transgender person with Medicaid cannot obtain coverage for hormone therapy, which non-transgender women routinely obtain in the form of birth control. That\u2019s a discrepancy activists are trying to change with a new lawsuit. Filed late last week by the Silvia Rivera Law Project and other groups, the lawsuit challenges a 1998 regulation which prevents transgender people from accessing sex reassignment surgery, hormones and other forms of care. In this video produced by the Silvia Rivera Law Project and GLAAD, healthcare providers and transgender people talk about the importance of basic health coverage.\n\nSTEPHEN: But I\u2019ve always known that I wanted to move here, for the city\u2019s vibrant artistic community. As a trans person, I would hope that I\u2019d be welcomed, but many trans people aren\u2019t, because we don\u2019t have the basic healthcare coverage that we need to survive.\n\nEGYPTT: In New York and many other states, transgender people like myself are so often refused coverage, even for routine and preventive care.\n\nREINA GOSSETT: Every day, people come into the Silvia Rivera Law Project because they have been denied the basic healthcare they need to survive.\n\nFINN: Transgender people, like all people, are healthier when they get the medical care they need.\n\nRONICA: Trans medicine is a medically necessary intervention. Many people believe that doing\u2014providing hormones for trans patients is cosmetic, but as a medical provider, I can tell you how crucial it is for the health and lives of trans people to have knowledgeable, trans-friendly providers.\n\nNERMEEN SHAIKH: The lawsuit over Medicaid coverage in New York follows a number of recent victories for transgender healthcare. Late last month, the federal Department of Health and Human Services overturned Medicare\u2019s blanket ban on sex reassignment surgery. The change means recipients of Medicare will no longer have their claims for coverage of surgery automatically denied. Just last week, Massachusetts became the third state in the country to cover transgender healthcare under Medicaid.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: All of this comes as activists are preparing to mark the 45th anniversary of the Stonewall uprising in New York City, a seminal event that helped launch the modern LGBT justice movement.\n\nTo talk about all these developments, we\u2019re joined by Pooja Gehi, staff attorney and director of the Immigrant Justice Project at Sylvia Rivera Law Project, which has just filed the class-action lawsuit over New York Medicaid\u2019s exclusion of transgender health coverage. And we\u2019re joined by Angie Milan-Cruz, one of the two lead plaintiffs in the suit.\n\nWe welcome you both to Democracy Now! Angie, your name is the lead name. The other person didn\u2019t want to be identified. Talk about why this is so important to you.\n\nANGIE MILAN-CRUZ: My personal experience has been hardship, depression, not being just accepted for who I am. I have to look at myself every day in the mirror and see the perfect me, but I want the whole package, where I can feel comfortable under my own skin.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: And what would that whole package be? Why sue the New York State Department of Health?\n\nANGIE MILAN-CRUZ: To have the right to have reassignment surgery.\n\nNERMEEN SHAIKH: So, Pooja Gehi, could you explain why it is that Medicaid did not do what Medicare did in allowing these procedures?\n\nPOOJA GEHI: Yeah, well, the Medicaid regulation in the state of New York is really dated. It goes back to 1998. And it was passed sort of under the radar, and it\u2019s a blanket exclusion to all transition-related healthcare. The only comments submitted were by two physicians, who actually said that the care is medically necessary and not experimental. And the state of New York went ahead anyways. And we think now is the time, right, with this Medicare decision. There\u2019s also the Affordable Care Act, has a regulation that says it cannot discriminate on the basis of gender identity and expression, which we think means all state-based Medicaid programs should also cover transition-related healthcare.\n\nNERMEEN SHAIKH: And they make the argument that somehow\u2014Medicaid makes the argument that these procedures are somehow dangerous for people who undergo them. And is that the justification that they provide?\n\nPOOJA GEHI: Mm-hmm.\n\nNERMEEN SHAIKH: And if that\u2019s the case, then how come that wasn\u2019t true when Medicare changed its policies?\n\nPOOJA GEHI: Mm-hmm. I mean, I think that that is the justification that the Department of Health in New York uses, and it\u2019s extremely dated. We\u2019ve seen\u2014and actually, the regulation is supposed to be up for review each year. And we haven\u2019t had any\u2014seen any movement on it since 1998. During that time, the American Medical Association has said that the care is medically necessary\u2014the American Psychiatric Association, the World Professional Standards for Transgender Healthcare, now Medicare and the Affordable Care Act. So we think now is the time that New York really needs to get on board.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: Last month in New York, activists interrupted a speech by the New York state health commissioner to demand Medicaid coverage for transgender healthcare. Members of the Sylvia Rivera Law Project took over the stage at a health conference during a keynote address by Commissioner Howard Zucker. They displayed a banner with the hashtag \"#TranshealthcareNOW.\" Member Reina Gossett spoke from the stage for several minutes.\n\nREINA GOSSETT: We\u2019re here to say that right now New York State Department of Health has a regulation that specifically excludes transgender people from accessing healthcare through Medicaid. Commissioner Howard Zucker has the power to change that. Please join us in demanding that Commissioner Zucker and the Department of Health end discrimination against transgender people in the great state of New York.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: This is your organization, the Sylvia Rivera Law Project.\n\nPOOJA GEHI: Yes.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: Pooja Gehi, explain how New York differs from other states, like Massachusetts.\n\nPOOJA GEHI: Yeah. Well, New York continues to have a regulation that specifically excludes all transition-related healthcare. And in actuality, they cover the exact same healthcare for non-trans people, but not for trans people under Medicaid. So what happened in Massachusetts is that the state\u2014the state Medicaid program reversed its regulation that excluded transition-related healthcare. And New York actually has the power to do the exact same thing.\n\nNERMEEN SHAIKH: And this care has actually been referred to as life-saving care. Could you explain how and why?\n\nPOOJA GEHI: Yeah, so, the Sylvia Rivera Law Project was founded in 2002. And since then, it\u2019s been one of the most intense, major, life-threatening things that we\u2019ve seen, is the way in which people are not able to access healthcare. And, you know, like any kind of healthcare, when you\u2019re not able to access what you need, you\u2019re more likely to suffer from suicidality, have increased rates of depression, not be able to work, not be able to participate in society in the way that you want to. And we also see people not able to access healthcare getting caught up in cycles of poverty and incarceration, because they are forced to resort to the black market, or they\u2019re forced to do\u2014engage in survival economies to be able to access the healthcare that they need, which then, of course, makes them more likely and more vulnerable to policing and incarceration.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: Over the weekend, a vigil was held for a transgender woman whose body was found burned and hidden behind a dumpster last Thursday in Fort Myers, Florida. The brutal murder of Yaz\u2019min Shancez was not labeled as a hate crime by local police. News-Press recently spoke with Yaz\u2019min\u2019s aunt.\n\nREPORTER: What kind of person was she? What do you remember most about her?\n\nBEATRICE LOGGINS: Just being a happy person, just full of life, that did not deserve to go out like that. He really didn\u2019t. Just happy. I mean, liked to dance all the time, the life of the party. \"Hey, let\u2019s get it started!\" you know, that type of thing. And I can just hear the voice over and over, you know what I\u2019m saying? And it\u2019s\u2014it\u2019s just hard.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: The National Coalition of Anti-Violence Programs recorded more than 2,000 hate incidents against LGBT people last year, including 18 anti-LGBT homicides. Eighty-nine percent of the murder victims were people of color; 72 percent were transgender women. Do you, Angie, feel threatened?\n\nANGIE MILAN-CRUZ: Yes, absolutely. You know, my experience\u2014being incarcerated, not being accepted for who I am, not able to find a job because of my sexual identity\u2014is heartwrenching for me, per se.\n\nNERMEEN SHAIKH: And when did you first approach Medicaid for assistance with sex reassignment surgery?\n\nANGIE MILAN-CRUZ: Over 15 years.\n\nNERMEEN SHAIKH: And what do you think, Pooja, are the prospects for success, given, as you\u2019ve pointed out, that so many other state and federal bodies have changed their position on sex reassignment surgery and other assistance to trans people? What do you think the prospects are for success with this class-action lawsuit?\n\nPOOJA GEHI: Yeah, I feel really positive about it. I mean, our main\u2014our major argument says that the federal government is saying that you cannot discriminate\u2014states are not allowed to discriminate in the care that they provide on the basis of diagnosis, which is exactly what New York state is doing. So, because Angie is a trans woman, she\u2019s not able to access the exact same care that non-trans people are able to access through Medicaid.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: I want to go to a clip of Sylvia Rivera herself, which the Sylvia\u2014she is the person who the Sylvia Rivera Law Project is named for, remembering the Stonewall uprising. She was one of the leaders of it, just down the street from our studios right here, in Greenwich Village. This is from the audio documentary Remembering Stonewall that was produced by Dave Isay in 1989 for the 20th anniversary of the uprising. Here\u2019s Sylvia Rivera remembering what happened on that day 45 years ago.\n\nSYLVIA RIVERA: Here, this queen is going completely bananas, you know, jumping on, hitting the windshield. The next thing you know, the taxicab was being turned over, the cars were being turned over, things\u2014windows were shattering all over the place, fires were burning around the place. It was beautiful. It really was. It was really beautiful.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: That was Sylvia Rivera. She died in 2002. The images of the people in the Stonewall bar with their stiletto heels hitting the police officers, launched the modern-day gay rights movement and LGBT movement. Why did your organization take her name?\n\nPOOJA GEHI: Yeah, well, Sylvia Rivera was a trendsetter, founder of Stonewall, but she also believed in intersectionality. So she was also a member of the Young Lords, where she provided meals for Puerto Rican folks in Harlem. She was part\u2014was an anti-prison activist. She talked\u2014she was an anti-racist activist. She was a trans activist. And she talked a lot about how all of those things are inextricably related, right? Which is what we really believe at the Sylvia Rivera Law Project, too. We know that for people to express their gender identity and expression, it\u2019s so much more challenging when people are also people of color, immigrant communities, people in prison, people living in poverty, people struggling against other barriers.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: Well, we want to thank you both for joining us, Pooja Gehi, staff attorney at the Sylvia Rivera Law Project, and Angie Milan-Cruz, the lead plaintiff in the class-action suit to get Medicaid to cover hormone therapy and other forms of care for transgender people.\n\nThis is Democracy Now!
