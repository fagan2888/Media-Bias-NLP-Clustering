The question they were asked was, \u201cHave you experienced any period of stress\u201d \u2014 1 month or longer \u2014 \u201cin relation to circumstances in everyday life, such as work, health, or family situation?\u201d\n\nStress was defined as anything stirring feelings of anxiety, irritability, tension, fear, nervousness or sleep disturbances.\n\nDiagnoses of dementia were based on neuropsychiatric examinations, interviews with people close to the participants and others, and medical records. The mean age for onset of dementia was 78 years.\n\nOf the 800 who began the study, 153 women developed dementia, including 104 diagnosed with Alzheimer\u2019s disease, which is the most common cause of dementia.\n\nThose women who scored highest on the scale of neuroticism had double the risk of developing dementia compared with those who scored the lowest \u2014 although the link also depended on whether the subjects also felt subjected to long-term stress.\n\nBeing extroverted or introverted on its own did not appear to heighten the risk of dementia, although the study found that women who were easily distressed and also tended to be introverted were at the highest risk of Alzheimer\u2019s.\n\nThe researchers said possible explanations for the link could be that a person\u2019s personality affects behavior and lifestyle, and that people who are rated low on neuroticism engage in practices that promote healthier metabolic, cardiovascular and inflammatory responses. `It\u2019s also possible that the combination of sustained stress and neuroticism has been shown to cause functional and structural changes in parts of the brain that control emotion, cognition and memory and are most affected by dementia.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://health.heraldtribune.com/files/2014/10/hfaging14.jpg"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}}, "article_summary": "Here\u2019s something to worry about: A recent study suggests that middle-aged women whose personalities tend toward the neurotic run a higher risk of developing Alzheimer\u2019s disease later in life.\nOf the 800 who began the study, 153 women developed dementia, including 104 diagnosed with Alzheimer\u2019s disease, which is the most common cause of dementia.\nBeing extroverted or introverted on its own did not appear to heighten the risk of dementia, although the study found that women who were easily distressed and also tended to be introverted were at the highest risk of Alzheimer\u2019s.\n\u201cMost Alzheimer\u2019s research has been devoted to factors such as education, heart and blood risk factors, head trauma, family history and genetics,\u201d said study author Lena Johansson.\nThe women also were asked to rate their levels of stress based on self-reported evaluations conducted in 1968, 1974, 1980, 2000 and 2005."}
