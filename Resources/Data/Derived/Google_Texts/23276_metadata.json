Central Florida is the swing region of this swing state\u2026and adding to the area\u2019s diversity is the Cassadaga Spiritualist Camp, a Volusia County community nicknamed \u201cThe Psychic Capital of the World.\u201d\n\nAnd psychics are voters, too, with political issues on their minds just like most people preparing to cast their ballots.\n\nThe first sign you\u2019ve reached Cassadaga is a literal sign\u2026for the Cassadaga Psychic Shop. Inside the store, crystals, incense, and jewelry are among the items for sale. There\u2019s soothing music, a friendly tattooed man at the cash register, and little private rooms for psychic readings.\n\nIt\u2019s in one of these rooms I speak to psychic reader Edna Velez-Munoz. The table between us is covered in a rich, colorful tapestry. Her ornate black and gold Tarot card deck sits forgotten for the moment as we talk politics.\n\nVelez-Munoz will not tell me whether her clients come in with political questions on their minds \u2013 that\u2019s confidential, she says, sort of like talking to a therapist. But she will tell me what\u2019s important to her this election season. It\u2019s Social Security. She tells me she recently turned 62\u2026and found that her benefits don\u2019t keep up with the cost of living.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve paid into the system, I\u2019ve worked my time, and I feel I\u2019m not asking for anything free. I\u2019m not asking for a hand-out,\u201d she says. \u201cI don\u2019t feel it\u2019s an \u2018entitlement\u2019 because I worked for it.\u201d\n\nLike many retirees, Velez-Munoz works to supplement her Social Security. She also gets a pension from her previous job with the City of New York, but she knows not everyone has the option of earning a pension these days. She worries about people living on Social Security alone, and she\u2019s frustrated that none of the candidates seem to be talking about it.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been watching all the debates and I don\u2019t recall it even being mentioned once,\u201d says Velez-Munoz. \u201cThey skirt all the issues, not just that one.\u201d\n\nHeading down Cassadaga\u2019s main street, I meet Covita Gray. She and two friends are heading for lunch at the nearly hundred-year-old Hotel Cassadega in the middle of town.\n\n\u201cI am concerned about having someone in the White House that continues with the legacy that [President] Obama has been trying to lay out,\u201d says Gray. \u201cAs a self-employed person, it is very important to me to have the health insurance. That has been a life-saver for me.\u201d\n\nShe says in her case, the Affordable Care Act has lived up to its name.\n\nBut another Cassadaga visitor says he doesn\u2019t find much \u201caffordable\u201d these days, and he thinks perhaps too many things are up for sale.\n\n\u201cCongress and the Supreme Court are bought and paid for,\u201d says Michael Linden. Linden sits outside a shop called The Purple Rose, waiting for his psychic reading there. It\u2019s his first time in this unique community, which is, at its heart, a church. It was founded in the late 1800\u2019s by a New York man who said he was led to the property by a spirit guide.\n\nLinden has come for a little guidance of his own. He says the issue at the top of his political list is fundamental fairness \u2013 or a lack of it.\n\n\u201cLobbyists, people like that, should not be allowed to exist. Everything should be fair,\u201d he says, adding that he feels corporate interests and big money are stacking the political deck against everyday Americans.\n\nKen Hernandez works inside the Purple Rose. Hernandez, also a Volusia County teacher, says it\u2019s the military that\u2019s weighing on his mind.\n\n\u201cBringing the troops home. I think that\u2019s my one biggest issue,\u201d Hernandez says. \u201cBeing a former military man, and being a teacher, I see where these young kids are going to be heading for, because the economy is so bad one of the only options that they have is the military.\u201d\n\nHernandez says he sees health care for veterans improving, in terms of physical health, but mental health care could be better. And that speaks to why many people are drawn to Cassadaga.\n\n\u201cThe body is one thing,\u201d he says, but \u201cespecially here in Cassadaga where we\u2019re more concerned with the spirit and the soul\u2026that part, we don\u2019t feel \u2013 well, I can\u2019t speak for all Cassadagans, but I feel that that part is not being take care of.\u201d\n\nBack at Cassadaga Psychic Shop, Edna Velez-Munoz has a message for the candidate who ultimately wins. And it\u2019s not from the Great Beyond. It\u2019s more like a little perspective from beyond America\u2019s borders.\n\nShe says, be an honorable president \u2013 the world is watching.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Psychics Are Voters Too \u2013 Talking Politics In Cassadaga", "generator": "MasterSlider 2.7.1 - Responsive Touch Image Slider | www.avt.li/msf", "title": "Psychics Are Voters Too \u2013 Talking Politics In Cassadaga - 90.7 WMFE", "og": {"site_name": "90.7 WMFE", "description": "Central Florida is the swing region of this swing state\u2026and adding to the area\u2019s diversity is the Cassadaga Spiritualist Camp, a Volusia County community nicknamed \u201cThe Psychic Capital of the World\u2026", "title": "Psychics Are Voters Too \u2013 Talking Politics In Cassadaga", "url": "http://www.wmfe.org/psychics-are-voters-too-talking-politics-in-cassadaga/57750", "image": {"width": 743, "identifier": "http://www.wmfe.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Purple-Rose-Ken-Hernandez.jpg", "height": 557}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.wmfe.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Purple-Rose-Ken-Hernandez.jpg?w=640", "site": "@wmfeorlando", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Nicole Creston", "robots": "index, follow", "fb": {"admins": 518629354, "app_id": 1548836692013354}, "article": {"published_time": "2016-03-11T17:44:45+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-03-11T21:26:34+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "Y7hH39hBuXyNDcSaUYeVS5reQoCbVDVCIdb0XQlgfzI"}, "article_summary": "The first sign you\u2019ve reached Cassadaga is a literal sign\u2026for the Cassadaga Psychic Shop.\n\u201cI don\u2019t feel it\u2019s an \u2018entitlement\u2019 because I worked for it.\u201dLike many retirees, Velez-Munoz works to supplement her Social Security.\nThis week 90.7 News is talking with central Florida voters before the state\u2019s March 15th presidential primary.\nHer ornate black and gold Tarot card deck sits forgotten for the moment as we talk politics.\nVelez-Munoz will not tell me whether her clients come in with political questions on their minds \u2013 that\u2019s confidential, she says, sort of like talking to a therapist."}
