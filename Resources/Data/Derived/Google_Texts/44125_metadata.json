Data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics shows that of the thirty fastest growing occupations, health care dominates the list with 20 different jobs.\n\nBLS also projects job growth of 19 percent over the next decade. This will result in an additional 2.3 million jobs in the sector. Two reasons driving the growth:\n\nMore people have insurance access through the Affordable Care Act\n\nBaby boomers are aging into Medicare.\n\nRelated: Top 5 Industries for Job Hunters in 2016\n\nAnd the good news is not all of the careers require years and years of medical school. Requirements range from being licensed to receiving a graduate degree, though additional accreditation typically leads to better-paying and more advanced jobs.\n\nBelow are the 50 top-paying careers in health care (low to high), along with the minimum education requirements for each position and their median salaries. The list, from the online publication Best Medical Degrees, is based on data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, Forbes and U.S. News and World Report.
