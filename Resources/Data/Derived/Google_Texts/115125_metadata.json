She pointed out the persecution to which Mormons were subjected in the 1800s, including Missouri Gov. Lilburn Boggs\u2019 infamous \u201cextermination order\u201d in 1838, noting that in today\u2019s terms such an order would be \u201cunthinkable.\u201d\n\nBut when elements of anti-Mormonism again surfaced during the Romney campaign, such as when Pastor Robert Jeffress expressed his opinion that Christians should not vote for Romney because he\u2019s a Mormon and Mormonism is a cult, \u201cprominent people stood up against ignorance and bigotry against Mormons,\u201d Goodstein said.\n\nRomney became the Republican candidate for president of the United States despite his church\u2019s historical standing among people of faith. \u201cHe had the support of more evangelical Christians than John McCain had four years earlier,\u201d Goodstein said. \u201cAnd when he lost, most pundits agree that his faith was not a determining factor.\u201d\n\nAnother example Goodstein cited was the reaction of many people of faith to the anti-Muslim sentiment that existed in America in the days following the Sept. 11 tragedy.\n\n\u201cIn the aftermath of 9/11,\u201d she said, \u201cI saw people of all faiths reaching out to the Muslim community. They understood that the Muslims living among them were not to blame. As a result of this outreach, I\u2019ve witnessed a blossoming of interfaith relationships all over the country.\u201d\n\nGoodstein sees two main reasons Americans are getting better at handling religious diversity. First, she said, is the First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, which guarantees the free exercise of religion along with free speech, freedom of the press and the right to peaceable assembly. This freedom, she said, \u201chas produced a vibrant marketplace\u201d of religious thought.\n\nThe second reason has to do with what she called \u201cincredible fluidity in American religious identity.\u201d\n\n\u201cAmericans convert,\u201d she said. \u201cThey marry someone from a different religious background. They try out different churches. People from different churches get to know each other. One-third of our married couples are married to someone of a different religion. When you live next door to someone from another faith, or you sit at Thanksgiving dinner with people from another faith, or you are married to someone from another faith, barriers and walls are broken down.\u201d\n\nOf course, Goodstein observed, \u201cwe\u2019ve not rid the country of religiously based violence, insanity and hatred.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know that we\u2019re ever going to come to the point where we all agree on everything,\u201d she continued. \u201cBut I think religious leaders are working to see if we can work together and find common cause across religious lines.\u201d\n\nOne of the areas where that is happening is the area of religious liberty. From Goodstein\u2019s perspective, recent concerns about threats to religious liberty started with concerns from the Catholic Church about Affordable Health Care Act provisions requiring insurance coverage of birth control.\n\n\u201cThe Catholic Church says this is a threat to religious liberty,\u201d Goodstein said. \u201cThen evangelicals joined in, then Mormon leaders started showing up at conference talking about this subject and now you have Greek Orthodox representatives, Jewish rabbis and all kinds of folks concerned about religious liberty. These are people who, 10 years ago, would not have worked together in such a public way. But now they are coming together, and I think there is some overlap, some positive residue when people work together on something like this.\u201d\n\nGoodstein\u2019s appearance at UVU was co-sponsored by several university organizations, including the Student Association, Academic Affairs, the Religious Studies and Honors programs and the centers for Global and Intercultural Engagement and the Study of Ethics.\n\nEmail: jwalker@desnews.com", "article_metadata": {"twitter": {"description": "In a country that is remarkable for both its religious diversity and devotion \u2014 a situation rife with potential volatility \u2014 one of America\u2019s leading faith journalists is impressed t", "creator": "@", "app": {"url": {"ipad": "itms://itunes.apple.com/us/app/deseret-news/id425758986?mt=8&uo=4", "iphone": "itms://itunes.apple.com/us/app/deseret-news/id425758986?mt=8&uo=4", "googleplay": "https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.deseretnews.android"}, "name": {"ipad": "Deseret News", "iphone": "Deseret News", "googleplay": "Deseret News"}, "id": {"ipad": 425758986, "iphone": 425758986, "googleplay": "com.deseretnews.android"}}, "title": "America is making religious diversity work, journalist says", "site": "@deseretnews", "card": "summary"}, "datePublished": "2013-10-26", "vr": {"category": "faith", "type": "article"}, "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"recommendable": "false"}}, "speare-timestamp": "2013-10-25 15:08:56", "copyright": "\u00a9 2016 Deseret News Publishing Company", "title": "America is making religious diversity work, journalist says", "image": "http://www.deseretnews.com/media/photos/web-1239429.jpg", "dsk": "faith", "tout": {"article": {"id": 865589158}}, "dateModified": "2013-10-26", "medium": "news", "description": "In a country that is remarkable for both its religious diversity and devotion \u2014 a situation rife with potential volatility \u2014 one of America\u2019s leading faith journalists is impressed t", "robots": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "fb": {"admins": 683545112, "app_id": 320112201431112, "pages": 16317479654}, "article": {"published_time": "2013-10-26T05:00-06:00"}, "viewport": "width=1024, initial-scale=0.1", "GOOGLEBOT": "ARCHIVE", "og": {"url": "http://www.deseretnews.com/article/865589158/America-is-making-religious-diversity-work-journalist-says.html?pg=all", "site_name": "DeseretNews.com", "image": "http://img.deseretnews.com/images/article/hires/1239429/1239429.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "America is making religious diversity work, journalist says"}, "author": "Joseph Walker", "thumbnail": "http://www.deseretnews.com/media/photos/web-1239429.jpg", "articleid": 865589158}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fddd69\"", "article_summary": "\u201cBut I think religious leaders are working to see if we can work together and find common cause across religious lines.\u201dOne of the areas where that is happening is the area of religious liberty.\n\u201cThe Catholic Church says this is a threat to religious liberty,\u201d Goodstein said.\nIn a country that is remarkable for both its religious diversity and devotion \u2014 a situation rife with potential volatility \u2014 one of America\u2019s leading faith journalists is impressed that America seems to be making it work.\nAs a result of this outreach, I\u2019ve witnessed a blossoming of interfaith relationships all over the country.\u201dGoodstein sees two main reasons Americans are getting better at handling religious diversity.\n\u201cThey marry someone from a different religious background."}
