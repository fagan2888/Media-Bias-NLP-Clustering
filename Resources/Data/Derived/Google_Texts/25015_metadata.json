The Obama administration said it acted quickly to fix all the problems identified by the Health and Human Services inspector general\u2019s office. But the episode raises questions about the government\u2019s ability to protect a vast new database at a time when cyberattacks are becoming bolder. Known as MIDAS, the $110-million system is the central electronic storehouse for information collected under President Barack Obama\u2019s health care law. It doesn\u2019t handle medical records, but it does include names, Social Security numbers, birthdates, addresses, phone numbers, passport numbers, employment status and financial accounts of customers on HealthCare.gov and state insurance marketplaces.\n\nThe Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Office of Inspector General (OIG) conducted the review between August and December 2014.\n\nThe audit found several vulnerabilities with the MIDAS database. For instance, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) did not simulate an attack on the database that would have revealed obvious security weaknesses.\n\n\u201cOur database vulnerability scans identified 22 high, 62 medium, and 51 low vulnerabilities\u201d with the system, the OIG said.\n\n\u201cIt sounds like a gold mine for ID thieves,\u201d Jeremy Gillula, staff technologist for the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a civil liberties group focused on technology, told ABC News. \u201cI\u2019m kind of surprised that this information was never compromised.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "An Obamacare database storing personal information on millions of Americans including Social Security Numbers was riddled with \u201cbasic security flaws.\"", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Free Beacon", "description": "An Obamacare database storing personal information on millions of Americans including Social Security Numbers was riddled with \u201cbasic security flaws,\u201d according to a report from an agency watchdog", "title": "Obamacare Database With Personal Information on Millions Had \u2018Basic Security Flaws\u2019", "url": "http://freebeacon.com/issues/obamacare-database-with-personal-information-on-millions-had-basic-security-flaws/", "image": "http://freebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/healthcare.gov_-150x150.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "An Obamacare database storing personal information on millions of Americans including Social Securit", "creator": "@LizWFB", "image": "http://freebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/healthcare.gov_-150x150.jpg", "title": "Obamacare Database With Personal Information on Millions Had \u2018Basic Security Flaws\u2019", "site": "@freebeacon", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1047859882", "fb": {"app_id": "FB_APP_ID", "pages": 282024895179874}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "BY: Follow @LizWFBAn Obamacare database storing personal information on millions of Americans including Social Security Numbers was riddled with \u201cbasic security flaws,\u201d according to a report from an agency watchdog.\nABC News reports:The government stored sensitive personal information on millions of health insurance customers in a computer system with basic security flaws, according to an official audit that uncovered slipshod practices.\nIt doesn\u2019t handle medical records, but it does include names, Social Security numbers, birthdates, addresses, phone numbers, passport numbers, employment status and financial accounts of customers on HealthCare.gov and state insurance marketplaces.\n\u201cOur database vulnerability scans identified 22 high, 62 medium, and 51 low vulnerabilities\u201d with the system, the OIG said.\nKnown as MIDAS, the $110-million system is the central electronic storehouse for information collected under President Barack Obama\u2019s health care law."}
