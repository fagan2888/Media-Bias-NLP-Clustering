(Some of which are ongoing on the Senate floor at the moment.) The others in that group \u2014 Rand Paul, Mike Lee, Marco Rubio \u2014 have tried to initiate real policy debates and shift the party\u2019s stance on major issues: Rubio with immigration, Paul (and Lee) with foreign policy and civil liberties, Paul with drug policy and criminal justice, and now Lee with family policy and tax reform. But not Cruz: He\u2019s defining himself as a national figure not by taking positions on questions that divide his party, but by picking issues where the party is basically united \u2014 Obamacare, gun control, taxes \u2014 and playing the maximalist while promising the moon. (Tellingly, on the specific fronts where the others have staked out some legitimately bold stances, the Texas senator has mostly tap-danced \u2014 he\u2019s \u201csomewhere between Rand Paul and John McCain\u201d on foreign policy, somewhere in the middle of his party on immigration, and so on.) Paul, Rubio and now Lee are all trying to move the party, and conservatism, in a particular direction; Cruz is telling conservatives to fight harder, but otherwise to stay exactly where they are.\n\nWhat makes this contrast interesting politically as well as substantively is that Cruz, Paul, and Rubio \u2014 while frequent allies in the Senate \u2014 are all in real competition with one another, both for the G.O.P. nomination in 2016, and also, as David Frum notes, for the more nebulous but perhaps more enduring role as the \u201cpolitical leader of American conservatism,\u201d a title held by Robert Taft, Barry Goldwater, Reagan, and Jack Kemp, which has been effectively vacant since Newt Gingrich\u2019s late-1990s fall. So we\u2019ll get to see their contrasting approaches put to a very direct sort of test.\n\nRight now, there\u2019s clear polling evidence that Rubio\u2019s policy foray on immigration has hurt him with G.O.P. voters, and decent evidence from polls and anecdotes that Cruz\u2019s spotlight-grab has helped him lay the groundwork for a \u201916 run. If you turn on talk radio, there\u2019s no question which of the two men is closer to being Mr. Conservative right now, at least for that segment of the right-of-center audience. Paul, meanwhile, is having a better year politically than Rubio, and enjoying much of the same movement enthusiasm that surrounds Cruz. But what Frum calls the \u201cmany ways in which \u2026 libertarian politics slant against the grain of conservatives in the country\u201d are still a challenge for Paul, and they could put a ceiling on his 2016 support and limit his long term role as a movement leader, leaving Cruz positioned to eclipse him in electoral support and movement influence alike.\n\nSo that\u2019s the case for betting on Cruz\u2019s continued ascent. The case against is, in part, a case from history: The Leaders of Conservatism that Frum cites all built their reputations over long, achievement-rich careers (Taft was a real legislator, Kemp was about Big Ideas and Outreach more than ideological correctness, Reagan was a successful governor, Gingrich was Speaker of the House), and even then most of them didn\u2019t win the Republican nomination for the presidency, let alone the White House itself. Cruz\u2019s \u201cI\u2019m not here to make friends\u201d strategy, on the other hand, feels built for the short term: It could position him as the True Conservative alternative to Chris Christie in 2016, if he can elbow Paul and Rubio and others (Scott Walker, etc.) out of the way, and then he could beat Christie, if the stars align and the base votes for purity in a way that it hasn\u2019t recently, and then he could beat Hillary Clinton, if \u2026 well, give me a few weeks and I\u2019ll come up with a scenario. But if he doesn\u2019t run the table, what then? His current influence with the grassroots is built on a promise to fight, and fight, and fight some more \u2014 but if he doesn\u2019t deliver victory, or if he ducks out of running in 2016 at all, how long can he actually retain the spotlight?\n\nTo my mind, a figure like Paul, who actually has a policy vision to go with his theatrics, and who inspires loyalty based on distinctive ideas as well as affect, seems much better positioned to survive a 2016 defeat with his prominence and influence intact, ready to lead the opposition to Hillary Clinton on both domestic and foreign policy or else to be a occasional-partner, occasional-problem for a President Christie. Whereas for Cruz to run and lose, either in the primaries or the general, feels like it would fatally puncture his current mystique.\n\nOf course he\u2019ll still be a United States senator in that situation (albeit one roundly disliked by most of his co-partisans), and there will be plenty of second acts available to him. Gingrich was a bomb-throwing backbencher originally, too: Maybe there\u2019s a decade-long, Newt-esque path Cruz can walk to become Senate Majority Leader, leading a caucus formed in his image. But right now, it\u2019s easier to see him slipping into a trajectory more like that of Jesse Helms \u2014 an influential veto point but not a dominant figure within the party \u2014 or else following Sarah Palin into the world of post-political right-wing celebrity than it is to imagine the next twenty years being the Cruz Era in conservatism.", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20130924155358, "BN": "douthat", "dfp-ad-unit-path": "opinion/douthat", "adxPage": "blog.nytimes.com/douthat/post", "DISPLAYDATE": "September 24, 2013", "article": {"published_time": 1380052438, "author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/opinion/editorialsandoped/oped/columnists/rossdouthat/index.html", "section": "Opinion", "collection": "http://json8.nytimes.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "tag": "Uncategorized", "modified_time": "2013-09-24T19:58:57-04:00"}, "keywords": "Cruz Ted,Gingrich Newt,Goldwater Barry M,Helms Jesse,Kemp Jack F,Palin Sarah,Paul Rand,Rubio Marco,Conservatism (US Politics),Presidential Election of 2016,Republican Party,Texas,Uncategorized", "communityAssetTaxonomy": "blogs/douthat/The Ambitions of Ted Cruz ( 20130924 )", "PT": "Blogs", "SCG": "douthat", "sourceApp": "blogs", "per": "Cruz, Ted;Gingrich, Newt;Goldwater, Barry M;Helms, Jesse;Kemp, Jack F;Palin, Sarah;Paul, Rand;Rubio, Marco", "twitter": {"description": "The contrasting approaches of the junior senator from Texas and his right-wing rivals.", "title": "The Ambitions of Ted Cruz", "url": "http://douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/09/24/the-ambitions-of-ted-cruz/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "site": "@DouthatNYT", "card": "summary"}, "blogpostid": 100000002462128, "description": "The contrasting approaches of the junior senator from Texas and his right-wing rivals.", "CG": "Opinion", "robots": "noodp", "dat": "September 24, 2013", "org": "Republican Party", "geo": "Texas", "utime": 20130924195857, "communityAssetLabels": "NYT_Blogs", "PUD": 20130924, "pdate": 20130924, "des": "Conservatism (US Politics);Presidential Election of 2016", "thumbnail": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "og": {"site_name": "Ross Douthat", "description": "The contrasting approaches of the junior senator from Texas and his right-wing rivals.", "title": "The Ambitions of Ted Cruz", "url": "http://douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/09/24/the-ambitions-of-ted-cruz/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/blogs_v5/../icons/t_logo_291_black.png", "type": "article"}, "communityAssetURL": "http://douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/09/24/the-ambitions-of-ted-cruz/", "PUV": "normal", "hdl": "The Ambitions of Ted Cruz", "thumbnail_150": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "PST": "Blog Post"}, "article_summary": "What makes this contrast interesting politically as well as substantively is that Cruz, Paul, and Rubio \u2014 while frequent allies in the Senate \u2014 are all in real competition with one another, both for the G.O.P.\nPaul, meanwhile, is having a better year politically than Rubio, and enjoying much of the same movement enthusiasm that surrounds Cruz.\nWhereas for Cruz to run and lose, either in the primaries or the general, feels like it would fatally puncture his current mystique.\nPaul, Rubio and now Lee are all trying to move the party, and conservatism, in a particular direction; Cruz is telling conservatives to fight harder, but otherwise to stay exactly where they are.\nGingrich was a bomb-throwing backbencher originally, too: Maybe there\u2019s a decade-long, Newt-esque path Cruz can walk to become Senate Majority Leader, leading a caucus formed in his image."}
