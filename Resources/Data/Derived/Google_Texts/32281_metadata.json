The amendment contains provisions to the Senate\u2019s \u201cFlorida Health Insurance Exchange\u201d program, or FHIX, aimed to neutralize critics like Gov. Rick Scott and House budget chief Richard Corcoran.\n\nFor example, the amendment removes a six-month transition period that puts new enrollees into the state\u2019s existing Medicaid system, opting instead to go straight to the private options starting January 1. And it makes sure that the same plans found on the federal insurance exchange are options for the expansion population. Corcoran has criticized the Senate plan for forcing people who currently use subsidies to purchase insurance on the exchange to give up their plans and join Medicaid.\n\nSen. Aaron Beach, R-Fernandina Beach, filed the amendment Tuesday as the sponsor of Senate Bill 7044. Bean called it \u201cFHIX 2.0\u201d or the \u201cFHIX Remix,\u201d and said \u201cbelieve it or not, it is even more conservative than the original bill.\u201d\n\nBut even this amended measure would face an uncertain future in the House. \u201cI don\u2019t see it being worked out,\u201d Corcoran said Tuesday after learning about the Senate\u2019s revised plan.\n\nUnder the revised bill, the state would provide vouchers to the estimated 800,000 who fall into the gap between Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act. Using the voucher, the recipient would purchase an insurance policy through a state-based insurance exchange.\n\nThe amendment also tightens the requirement that those receiving vouchers either work, volunteer or demonstrate they are seeking employment by registering with CareerSource Florida, the state\u2019s workforce development agency. There are exceptions for the disabled and for caregivers.\n\nThe vouchers would be paid for with the funds from the federal government that had been promised for Medicaid expansion, an estimated $50 billion over the next decade.\n\n\u201cThis way we maintain sovereignty,\u201d Bean said.\n\nThe federal government has never before approved a work requirement as part of a state\u2019s Medicaid expansion plan. If Washington doesn\u2019t agree with aspects of the bill, \u201cthe feds would likely come to us with a plan,\u201d Bean said. \u201cWe would have the final say. We could approve it or change it again.\u201d\n\nHouse Speaker Steve Crisafulli expressed doubt about the revised plan because it includes a work requirement that the federal government has frowned upon in the past. And Scott issued a statement indicating the Senate revisions would not affect his opposition to Medicaid expansion.\n\n\u201cThe Senate\u2019s plan to expand Medicaid under Obamacare will cost Florida taxpayers $5 billion over 10 years,\u201d Scott said Tuesday. \u201cA budget that keeps Florida\u2019s economy growing will cut taxes and give Floridians back more of the money they earn, not inevitably raise taxes in order to implement Obamacare and grow government.\u201d\n\nBean said his highest priority is \u201ckeeping the doors of UF Health open.\u201d He is employed at the Jacksonville hospital that treats a large number of uninsured patients.\n\nWith the federal government reducing Low Income Pool funding to $1 billion next year, a decrease of $1.2 billion, it\u2019s going to take $700 million in general revenue funds from the state to ensure safety net hospitals like UF Health don\u2019t lose money in the coming fiscal year.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s very expensive,\u201d Bean said.\n\nThe Senate\u2019s Health Policy Committee, which he chairs, will consider the FHIX amendment and likely vote on the Medicaid expansion plan Monday. The full Senate could vote as early as June 3, sending the matter to the House for consideration.\n\nMeanwhile the governor\u2019s Healthcare and Hospital Commission plans to meet June 4 and start drafting recommendations to improve how state funding is divided among Florida\u2019s hospitals, especially those that provide the most charity care.\n\nThe commission held its second meeting Tuesday in Orlando, where members learned more about hospital profit margins and the impact of LIP dollars used to help defray the costs of treating the uninsured.\n\nFor example, UF Health Jacksonville had a slight loss last year, but it would have been worse without the $95 million in LIP funding the hospital receives. Jackson Memorial Hospital in Miami posted a profit, but it would have been in the red without hundreds of million of LIP dollars.\n\nThese two hospitals are among 26 the commission praised for mostly complying with Scott\u2019s wide-ranging request for financial and patient data. The commission also publicly chastised 194 hospitals that have refused to respond, including members of the for-profit HCA chain that Scott once led.\n\nTia Mitchell: (850) 933-1321\n\nCharlie Patton: (904) 359-4413", "article_metadata": {"description": "TALLAHASSEE | The Florida Senate says it is willing to alter its Medicaid expansion plan to gain the support of House Republicans who have opposed the measure.Starting Monday, the first day of a special session to craft the state budget, senators will consider an amendment to the same Medicaid expansion proposal they approved during the regular session.
