If you're trying to figure whether you qualify for tax credits through Cover Oregon or any state or federal health insurance exchange, you'll likely run into this question:

What in the world is modified adjusted gross income? Or, MAGI, as they say in tax circles.

It's understandable you might be confused, says David Baldwin, an accountant at Cleveland Estes Avellone in Phoenix and an expert on self-employment taxes. The MAGI used to calculate Cover Oregon tax credits differs from MAGIs used in other areas of your income tax return.

In fact, MAGI for calculating insurance premium tax credits even differs from the MAGI you calculate to determine the penalty you could face for not getting health insurance. That's right: Health reform has introduced two new MAGIs.

First, let's start with AGI — adjusted gross income. That's the figure you find on the last line of the front page of Form 1040 and Form 1040A. It's on Line 4 of Form 1040EZ.

MAGI requires you to add back some income that you'd originally subtracted to get your AGI. But the add-backs differ depending on which tax calculation you're looking at.

MAGI in the Affordable Care Act is not the MAGI used to figure out whether you make too much money to contribute to a Roth IRA. It's also not the MAGI used on Form 8582 to calculate passive activity loss limits for landlords. Neither is it the MAGI used to determine how much of a senior's Social Security benefits can be taxed.

To calculate your MAGI for the premium tax credits, add these items together:

• Your adjusted gross income from your federal tax return

• Any tax-exempt interest you earned (Line 8b on Form 1040)

• Any foreign earned income and housing expenses (Form 2555)

• Any untaxed Social Security benefits (Line 20a minus Line 20b on Form 1040)

• The modified adjusted gross income reported by any dependents you claim in your household who are required to file a tax return. This could be your live-in adult child or a working relative whom you claim as a dependent for tax purposes. Even an unrelated person living with you for whom you provided at least half their support and who grossed less than $3,800 last year can be a dependent.

Now, to figure your MAGI for calculating your "shared responsibility" penalty for not getting insurance, do the same calculation above EXCEPT:

• Don't add in any untaxed Social Security income

Why is this any of this important?

For most, it probably isn't. But if you have significant foreign earnings, income from tax-free municipal bonds or a tax dependent who files a separate return, knowing this calculation could make a difference in determining your credits. It could keep you from over-estimating credits and having to pay them back when you file your 2014 tax return.

And, that could make you ill.
