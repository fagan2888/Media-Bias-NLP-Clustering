Ian Kucerak/Edmonton Sun/QMI Agency\n\nAlberta\u2019s new Human Services minister admits he was annoyed the impact his turban had on some of his electorate 12 years into the 21st century.\n\nSome arguments on the doorsteps of his Calgary-Montrose riding during last year\u2019s provincial election weren\u2019t as enlightened as he\u2019d hoped, said Manmeet Bhullar.\n\n\u201cI had some people who wanted to discuss whether Sikhs had the right to wear turbans in the RCMP,\u201d said practising Sikh Bhullar.\n\n\u201cThat was a debate back when I was in Grade 4 or 5 or 6.\u201d\n\nFortunately, he said, that decidedly federal issue wasn\u2019t one to derail an electoral win with a considerably more comfortable margin than the 35% of the vote he\u2019d garnered in his debut victory in 2008.\n\nSince that baptismal election, Bhullar\u2019s gone on to become the youngest ever to be elected MLA and be appointed to cabinet in Alberta \u2014 at ages 28 and 31 respectively.\n\nHis youth sends an important message to younger age brackets least likely to cast a vote, he said.\n\n\u201cThey may not like what they see of the system but it\u2019s that system that can make the most meaningful changes in the world,\u201d he said.\n\nThe parents of Calgary native Bhullar came to Canada from India\u2019s Punjab region in the early 1970s, seeking a better future on a host of fronts \u2014 from health care and education to democracy, said the Tory MLA.\n\nBorn at the city\u2019s General hospital in 1980, he grew up and attended school in northeast Calgary at a time when the area wasn\u2019t nearly as multicultural as it is now.\n\nHe recalls being bullied by classmates relentlessly for his appearance.\n\n\u201cThere weren\u2019t many of us kids in school wearing turbans \u2014 it wasn\u2019t always the most pleasant experience,\u201d he said.\n\nAlberta\u2019s attitudes towards diversity have progressed, he says, \u201cbut we\u2019ve got a long ways to go and it\u2019s not just about tolerance towards turbans.\u201d\n\nHe also differed from most of his contemporaries with an early love for politics that had him delivering election fliers in the 1980s for Calgary Tory mainstay Rick Orman, a friend of his father\u2019s.\n\n\u201cI was one of the few people who used to enjoy it \u2014 I\u2019d try to find a way to get to the campaign office and help out,\u201d said Bhullar.\n\nWhile garnering a law degree from the University of Windsor, Bhullar\u2019s political bug led to the office of Calgary Centre-North MP and cabinet minister Jim Prentice for whom he worked as a special assistant.\n\nPrentice, he said, served as a mentor and encouraged him on his own political odyssey.\n\nUpon winning by a 617-vote margin in a crowded field in 2008. Bhullar was named parliamentary assistant to the minister of advanced education, followed by a similar post in municipal affairs.\n\nHe admits engaging in the rough and tumble of politics has had its disillusioning moments.\n\n\u201cWhy would I want to devote time to something so vicious and difficult? Because it\u2019s worth it,\u201d he said.\n\nIt was a determination he shared with colleagues that saw him boosted in October, 2011 to the post of Service Alberta Minister.\n\nFrom then, he said, there have been few Manmeet Bhullar days off.\n\nHe wasted little time, he said, in going beyond provincial boundaries in advocate for wireless customers on roaming costs, an effort that ultimately saw the CRTC crafting a new industry conduct codes.\n\nEmpowering condominium owners, he said, has been another priority in the process of being realized with the advent of so-called condo tribunals designed to resolve conflicts between tenants, boards or developers.\n\nNow, the youthful, bearded cabinet minister has been assigned the post of Human Services minister in the wake of a firestorm over the province\u2019s underreporting of the deaths of children in its care.\n\nBhullar said he knows he\u2019s been handed a tough assignment on a daily razor\u2019s edge.\n\n\u201cThis an extremely sensitive portfolio, one that touches the lives of many Albertans, particularly the most vulnerable Albertans,\u201d he said.\n\nHe defended his predecessor Dave Hancock\u2019s handling of the portfolio, saying he deftly melded a number of departments to offer more comprehensive services.\n\nThe way ahead, he said, is more ensuring more effective intervention and prevention.\n\nAs well, \u201cincreasing the number of affordable day care spaces in Alberta,\u201d is another priority.\n\n\u201cQuality day care has a great impact on a child.\u201d\n\nBhullar was sworn in to his new cabinet position on Friday.\n\nbill.kaufmann@sunmedia.ca\n\nOn Twitter: @SUNBillKaufmann", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Calgary Sun", "description": "Alberta\u2019s new Human Services minister admits he was annoyed the impact his turban had on some of his electorate 12 years into the 21st century.", "title": "Newly minted Service Alberta Minister and Calgary MLA Manmeet Bhullar busy in new role", "url": "http://www.calgarysun.com/2013/12/14/newly-minted-service-alberta-minister-and-calgary-mla-manmeet-bhullar-busy-in-new-role?utm_source=facebook&utm_medium=recommend-button&utm_campaign=Newly minted Service Alberta Minister and Calgary MLA Manmeet Bhullar busy in new role", "image": "http://storage.calgarysun.com/v1/dynamic_resize/sws_path/suns-prod-images/1297504065837_LARGE_BOX.jpg?quality=80&stmp=1464080387840&size=100x", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 162622253780945}, "description": "Alberta\u2019s new Human Services minister admits he was annoyed the impact his turban had on some of his electorate 12 years into the 21st century.", "robots": "NOODP,NOYDIR", "pinterest": "nopin"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb779\"", "article_summary": "Human Services minister Manmeet Bhullar is sworn in during the swearing in of Premier Alison Redford's new cabinet at Government House in Edmonton, Alta., on Friday, Dec. 13, 2013.\nIan Kucerak/Edmonton Sun/QMI AgencyAlberta\u2019s new Human Services minister admits he was annoyed the impact his turban had on some of his electorate 12 years into the 21st century.\nFrom then, he said, there have been few Manmeet Bhullar days off.\nSome arguments on the doorsteps of his Calgary-Montrose riding during last year\u2019s provincial election weren\u2019t as enlightened as he\u2019d hoped, said Manmeet Bhullar.\nNow, the youthful, bearded cabinet minister has been assigned the post of Human Services minister in the wake of a firestorm over the province\u2019s underreporting of the deaths of children in its care."}
