We didn\u2019t see generic drugs placed on the highest tier in 2014,\u201d said Kirsten Sloan, the group\u2019s senior policy director.\n\nOften, that tier means patients pay a percentage of the cost of the drugs, rather than a flat dollar amount, which is more common for drugs placed into lower cost-sharing categories.\n\nWith many cancer drugs costing more than $5,000 a month, paying a percentage, also known as \u201cco-insurance,\u201d means patients must pay hundreds or even thousands of dollars at the pharmacy counter until they reach their annual insurance deductible.\n\nThis appears \u201cnot to be designed to encourage use of cheaper or more effective alternatives, but to extract the maximum patient cost-sharing for cancer drugs,\u201d the report said.\n\nThe study called on the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and state regulators to restrict insurers from charging policyholders a percentage of the cost of the prescription drugs, a proposal sure to face sharp opposition from insurers, who say it is one way to control overall spending and slow premium increases.\n\nClare Krusing, spokeswoman for America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans, said insurers pick up the majority of the cost of prescription medications in most cases, and the restrictions the advocates urge don\u2019t address what she says is the real problem.\n\n\u201cThe bigger issue here is the prices being charged by drug makers for these medications and whether those are fair and reasonable,\u201d Krusing said.\n\nBut drug makers have a very different perspective. They say insurance plans that lack transparency and shift more costs to consumers are the problem.\n\n\u201cWhat do drug prices have to do with patient access to information about coverage, formulary placement and cost sharing?\u201d asked Allyson Funk, spokeswoman for Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America.\n\n\u201cInsurers are increasingly singling out medicines for high cost sharing and restrictions on access compared to other more expensive health care services. On average, patients pay out of pocket nearly 20 percent of their total prescription drug costs compared to 5 percent of hospital care costs.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, in its report, the cancer advocacy group also questioned whether insurance plan designs that place a lot of cancer drugs into the highest cost-sharing tiers are discriminatory. Similar concerns have been raised by HIV/AIDS groups following reports that many plans place all or most HIV drugs \u2014 including generics \u2014 into high cost-sharing tiers.\n\nEarlier this year, Avalere Health, a consulting firm, reported that some insurance plans sold on state and federal marketplaces place all drugs used for complex diseases like HIV, cancer and multiple sclerosis, into those highest cost tiers.\n\nThe study out Wednesday by ACS/CAN reviewed the drug formularies for 66 silver-level plans available to consumers in California, Florida, Illinois, North Carolina, Texas and Washington.\n\nThese plans cover about half of marketplace enrollees nationwide. The 22 drugs are just a sample of the total number of cancer drugs available, but include several different classes of cancer treatments, and both oral and intravenous treatments.\n\nIn other recommendations, the report said that federal and state marketplaces where consumers buy insurance should do a better job of providing direct links to drug formularies, which are the lists of medicines covered by a plan. Additionally, they need to ensure that information about patients\u2019 share of the cost of the drugs is accurately listed.\n\n\u201cAdvocacy groups are telling consumers to be vigilant about picking a plan, but consumers then find they don\u2019t have all the tools they need,\u201d Sloan said.\n\nKaiser Health News is an editorially independent program of the Henry J.
