HYDERABAD, India (AP) — Heavy rains and gusts ripped through a large swath of India’s eastern seaboard, uprooting trees and snapping power cables as a powerful cyclone swept through the Bay of Bengal, one of two storms pounding Asia on Sunday.

In Japan, at least 35 people have been reported injured as Typhoon Vongfong, packing winds of up to 180 kilometers (110 miles) per hour, unleashed rains and gusts on Okinawa and was aiming at the next island of Kyushu, where authorities told 150,000 people to evacuate.

Cyclone Hudhud, described as “very severe” by India’s meteorological department, could pack winds of 195 kilometers (120 miles) per hour when it makes landfall around noon Sunday.

The cyclone is expected to hit near the city of Visakhapatnam, one of the largest cities in southern India and a major naval base.

At least 400,000 people have been evacuated from the coastal areas of Andhra Pradesh and Orissa states as authorities aimed for zero casualties. Hundreds of shelters have been set up to house the evacuees.

As the storm approached the coast Sunday, it picked up speed and strength and experts said it could cause widespread devastation.

Already hundreds of trees have been uprooted, Chief Staff Officer of India’s Eastern Naval Command S.K. Grewal told reporters, adding that 30 diving and 20 rescue teams were on standby.

Hundreds of rescuers of India’s National Disaster Response Force were also spread out across the two states that are expected to take the brunt of the cyclone.

Electricity lines have been disconnected in separate parts of Andhra Pradesh to avoid electrocutions, Arvind Kumar, a relief and rescue official told reporters.
