It is a system of diagnostic codes that physicians use to let Medicare and every other insurance provider know what the patient is being treated for. Depending on the diagnosis, ICD codes are from three to seven digits in length. So, if a physician sees a new patient and he diagnoses him with anemia, he would use the ICD code 280. If it is a more serious type of anemia, like Plummer-Vision Syndrome, the ICD code used would be 280.8.\n\nThe U.S. is still using ICD version 9, which has about 18,000 codes. In October, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services will switch over to ICD-10, which has about 80,000 codes.\n\nIf you think dealing with over four times as many codes is going to add considerably to the costs of running a physician\u2019s practice, you\u2019re right. According to John Grimsley and John S. O\u2019Shea, M.D. of the Heritage Foundation, \u201cthe potential cost of productivity loss [could] be anywhere from $8,500 to over $1.6 million per practice per annum\u2026depending on practice size.\u201d Of course\u2014and here is why you should be concerned\u2014the more resources that physicians have to spend dealing with codes mean less resources that will be spent treating patients.\n\nWhile the cost of complying with ICD-10 will fall on all physicians, it is likely to fall hardest on primary care physicians, a topic I examine in my forthcoming book, Medicare\u2019s Victims: How the U.S. Government\u2019s Largest Health Care Program Harms Patients and Impairs Physicians. (\u201cSqueezing every last bit of book promotion out of this blog, aren\u2019t we?\u201d \u2014 the Wife.)\n\nOne of the physicians I interview, Dr. Juliette Madrigal-Dersch, explains it this way:\n\nWhen you are a primary care physician, you are going to see a much wider variety of illnesses. If you are a specialist you are going to see a much more finite number of illnesses, especially if you are, say, an orthopedic surgeon who does primarily knees, probably 90 percent of all your codes are going to be the same five codes. As opposed to primary care, you never know what\u2019s going to walk through the door. You could get something very rare. And now you have to be so specific with the codes. You have to code for \u201cfall from uneven ground,\u201d or \u201cfall from tractor.\u201d\n\nIndeed, the ICD-10 codes have become something of a laughingstock. If it can be coded, it probably is in ICD-10. For example, there are codes for a bite from one of these guys:\n\nThe Gila Monster is found primarily in the Southwest United States and Mexico. And there must be an epidemic of Gila Monster bites! How else to explain the fact that there are 13 ICD-10 codes for having this guy clamp down on your hand? Indeed, it is so serious that physicians may need to practice coding for Gila Monster bites. One of the codes, T63.111, \u201cshould only be used for training or planning purposes.\u201d\n\nHere is a table listing the other 12 codes:\n\nThis leads to a number of questions. First, are there are lot of people who get bit by a Gila Monster more than once? Second, is it correct in assuming that the \u201cintentional self-harm\u201d codes are there because a lot of people use this type of lizard to attempt suicide? Finally, how do you assault someone with a Gila Monster? I don\u2019t know the answers to those questions, but I sure am glad that ICD-10 includes codes for them.\n\nNow, here is the part where you come in. ICD10Data is a search engine for ICD-10 codes. I want you to go there, and type in any animal or object (like a lamp post or sink) that you can think of, and see if the ICD-10 has a code for it. If it does, go back to the Facebook page that led you to this blog post, and in a comment tell me what animal or object you found a code for.\n\nAfter all, what else are you going to do with your Fourth of July weekend?", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://www.conservativeblog.org/storage/GilaCodes.png?__SQUARESPACE_CACHEVERSION=1435869594112", "description": "Apparently, the deadline to test the new ICD-10 system with Medicare has just passed .\n\n If you&am...", "title": "Medicare and the Gila Monster\u00a0Threat! - Amy Ridenour's National Center Blog - A Conservative Blog"}, "blogburst-verify": "B9EORVLmLdD0z2JKwETUEmoZ", "Robots": "index,follow"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf4f1\"", "article_summary": "First, are there are lot of people who get bit by a Gila Monster more than once?\nAnd there must be an epidemic of Gila Monster bites!\nFinally, how do you assault someone with a Gila Monster?\nIndeed, it is so serious that physicians may need to practice coding for Gila Monster bites.\nFor example, there are codes for a bite from one of these guys:The Gila Monster is found primarily in the Southwest United States and Mexico."}
