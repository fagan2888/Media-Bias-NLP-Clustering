Others will still pay Yandex per click.\n\nAlexander Feoktistov, head of marketing at Yandex.Market, said the new model would be more convenient for users.\n\nHe declined to say whether he expected a revenue boost from the change. But Vladimir Baydin, from J\u2019son & Partners Consulting, said the change could add up to $20 million to Yandex.Market\u2019s annual revenue, which Mr. Baydin estimates at $60 million to $80 million.\n\nOnline retail is growing sharply in Russia as Internet use spreads and incomes grow. Morgan Stanley forecasts sales in the sector will hit $36 billion in 2015, triple last year\u2019s figure.\n\nOver half of all Russian consumers begin their search for a product through Yandex, according to Morgan Stanley.\n\nMr. Baydin said Yandex is looking to consolidate the online retail market as a way to stay ahead of global players such as eBay Inc., which this year launched a Russian-language website.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "Russia\u2019s most popular search engine, Yandex, is transforming its product-search service Yandex.Market into an online marketplace as it looks to take a larger slice of Russia\u2019s growing Internet retail sector.", "title": "Yandex Expands to Online Marketplace", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/emergingeurope/2013/10/08/yandex-expands-to-online-marketplace/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/img/WSJ_profile_lg.gif"}, "site": "EmergingEurope", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Business", "article.headline": "Yandex Expands to Online Marketplace", "description": "Russia\u2019s most popular search engine, Yandex, is transforming its product-search service Yandex.Market into an online marketplace as it looks to take a larger slice of Russia\u2019s growing Internet retail sector.", "article_section": "Business", "author": "Olga Razumovskaya", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "Emerging Europe Real Time Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "Emerging Europe Real Time", "article.summary": "Russia\u2019s most popular search engine, Yandex, is transforming its product-search service Yandex.Market into an online marketplace as it looks to take a larger slice of Russia\u2019s growing Internet retail sector.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2013-10-08T16:21:34-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-142", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/emergingeurope/2013/10/08/yandex-expands-to-online-marketplace/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-NEB-7098", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Business", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "Russia\u2019s most popular search engine, Yandex, is transforming its product-search service Yandex.Market into an online marketplace as it looks to take a larger slice of Russia\u2019s growing Internet retail sector.", "title": "Yandex Expands to Online Marketplace", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/emergingeurope/2013/10/08/yandex-expands-to-online-marketplace/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/blogs/img/WSJ_Logo_BlackBackground_1200x630social", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Emerging Europe Real Time", "article.id": "BL-NEB-7098", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2013-10-08T16:22:07-04:00"}, "article_summary": "MOSCOW\u2014Russia\u2019s most popular search engine, Yandex, is transforming its product-search service Yandex.Market into an online marketplace as it looks to take a larger slice of Russia\u2019s growing Internet retail sector.\nOver half of all Russian consumers begin their search for a product through Yandex, according to Morgan Stanley.\nMr. Baydin said Yandex is looking to consolidate the online retail market as a way to stay ahead of global players such as eBay Inc., which this year launched a Russian-language website.\nOnline retail is growing sharply in Russia as Internet use spreads and incomes grow.\nYandex.Market is Russia\u2019s biggest aggregator of goods on the Internet, with 13,000 partner stores across several countries and 17 million users in Russia."}
