A recent report from the Congressional Budget Office contains what the administration must surely receive as good news: Its plan to raise the minimum wage to the Democrats\u2019 new target of $10.10 could lift as many as 900,000 Americans out of poverty. The bad news is that it would cast 500,000 American into unemployment by eliminating their jobs.\n\nIn December, the president claimed that there is \u201cno solid evidence\u201d that raising the minimum wage costs jobs, an assessment that the Washington Post\u2019s fact-check column awarded two Pinocchios. The president, the Post concluded, was \u201cdismissing the research and findings of a significant part of the economic academy,\u201d that being the not-entirely-controversial claim that buyers buy less of a good when the price goes up. But the president has not been alone in this claim: Joe Sestak argued that we could raise the minimum wage beyond $10.10 \u201cand people would not lose their jobs.\u201d Paul Krugman smugly dismissed these fears in the pages of the New York Times: \u201cThe answer is that we have a lot of evidence on what happens when you raise the minimum wage. And the evidence is overwhelmingly positive: hiking the minimum wage has little or no adverse effect on employment.\u201d The New York Times editorial board joined in: \u201cThe weight of the evidence shows that increases in the minimum wage have lifted pay without hurting employment.\u201d MSNBC\u2019s Jared Bernstein, a senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, accused those critical of the proposed pay hike of ignoring the \u201cevidence.\u201d\n\nCBO estimates are considered the gold standard for policy analysis \u2014 when they suit Democrats\u2019 rhetorical needs. For example, the CBO dutifully produced reports showing that, if enacted precisely as written, the Affordable Care Act would reduce deficits \u2014 even as the CBO emphasized the unlikelihood of that outcome. Nonetheless, Obamacare critics were pounded over the head with the CBO estimate by such abject apologists as Ezra Klein, late of the Washington Post. Now the Democrats are in a pickle: They can dismiss the estimates of the CBO, which they have relied upon for so much support, or they can say that they do not give a fig about the half-million Americans that the Obama administration\u2019s preferred policy would throw out of work. Mr. Klein, to his credit, has in the past acknowledged the relationship between the price of labor and the demand for labor: In his estimate, throwing low-income people out of work is worth it.\n\nPresidential aide and White House tweeter-in-chief Dan Pfeiffer offered his characteristic dime-deep insight, writing: \u201cThe logical extension of the GOP position on today\u2019s CBO report would be to call for lowering the minimum wage.\u201d But that is in fact the tradeoff: Demand curves point south. You can have higher demand and lower prices or lower demand and higher prices. Stamp your feet all you like, you can\u2019t stamp out supply and demand. The logical extension of this insight is not to lower the minimum wage, but to abolish it. The federal minimum wage is merely a statutory floor; the real minimum wage, which already is collected by our millions upon millions of unemployed and will be collected by a half-million more should the Democrats get their way, is $0.00. That\u2019s what unemployment pays.\n\nThe stagnant wages of low-income and middle-class Americans are a national scandal, but the solution to it must be an economic one rather than a political one. Americans who are not bound for law school and high-tech jobs need a different and better model of education; the Democrats stop their having it. They do not need the importation of millions of largely uneducated and low-skilled workers from abroad; the Democrats insist upon it. (And so do a number of dangerously wrongheaded Chamber of Commerce Republicans.) American workers need massive capital investment to raise the value of their labor; Democrats desire to tax it. Economic reality is non-negotiable, and passing a law against awful job markets and the wages associated with them will not make that reality go away.", "article_metadata": {"tweettext": "No Minimum-Wage Free Lunch", "sailthru.author": "The Editors", "description": "If there is a single lesson that the Obama administration is committed to not learning, it is that economics involves tradeoffs.
