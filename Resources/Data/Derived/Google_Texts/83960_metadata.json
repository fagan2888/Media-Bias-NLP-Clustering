Take our quiz to find out!\n\nFor months, the real estate tycoon has sat atop Republican presidential polls to the befuddlement of the political universe. But there is a growing body of evidence that many Americans \u2013 particularly white, working-class Americans in red states \u2013 are battling against what Princeton University sociologist Paul Starr calls \u201ca dire collapse of hope.\u201d\n\nWhen Mr. Trump says he wants to \u201cmake America great again,\u201d his message is resonating far beyond a political slogan into an existential angst for these Americans.\n\nIn short, a number of indicators suggest that they are simply struggling to survive and have lost faith in the American government\u2019s ability to do anything about it.\n\n\u201cI think a lot of people relying on the government are fed up with relying on the government,\u201d says John Jones, a 50-something poultry dealer without a college degree. For these people, he says, Trump is a breath of fresh air, even hope. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t pull any punches. He tells it like it is.\u201d\n\nAxis of need\n\nThe issues facing these economic survivors are evident in a host of statistics.\n\nThe study released this week by the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences found that the surprising rise in middle-age, white mortality in America from 1999 to 2013 was driven by a rise in suicide, drug abuse, and alcoholism. The trends were strongest among those with the least education and in the predominantly red South and West, with the authors suggesting a vicious cycle of physical pain and addiction to painkillers, compounded by fiscal uncertainty.\n\n\u201c[M]any of the baby-boom generation are the first to find, in midlife, that they will not be better off than were their parents,\u201d the authors write.\n\nMeanwhile, data show that the primary red axis of the country, running from Appalachia to the Southern coastal plains, is the epicenter of some of the nation\u2019s greatest stresses. It\u2019s here that the lack of well-paying jobs and large-scale abandonment of the job market are most pronounced, where obesity and health problems are most dire, where Walmart is winning a race to the bottom of what the American consumer can afford amid stagnating wages, and where the rising dependence on disability and Medicare is most pronounced.\n\n\u201cWe know that problems of poverty and health are more endemic \u2026 in the red parts of the country,\u201d says Jacob Hacker, a political scientist at Yale University. \u201cThat suggests that there\u2019s probably lots of Republicans who live in areas where more effective government action could help them.\u201d\n\nYet the South is where Obamacare sign-ups lag far behind other parts of the country. Nationwide, only 38 percent of white voters without college degrees voted for President Obama in 2012.\n\nThe answer to these apparent contradictions points to the equally strong rejection of the Republican establishment so far this election cycle: Trump has owned the red state working class, with non-college-educated whites favoring him at twice the rate of college-educated Republicans.\n\nTwo of those supporters are Paul Jones and Polly Huff, siblings who are watching the light traffic in the small Georgia town of Rutledge through the dusty windows of their classic small-town hardware store. Mr. Jones (who is unrelated to the poultry dealer) says he\u2019s on Obamacare, and resents it. \u201cI hate taking something that other people are paying for,\u201d he says. \u201cPeople think this stuff is free. It\u2019s not. Somebody always pays.\u201d\n\nMs. Huff says the distress is palpable in their business, which hasn't recovered since the recession. The problem is that fewer people have extra money to spend, some because they're underemployed, others because \u201cthey\u2019re scared of losing the jobs they do have,\u201d she says.\n\nA poll this week showed that 74 percent of Georgia Republicans would vote for Trump if he's the GOP nominee. \u201cI\u2019ll vote for him over anyone from the other party,\u201d says Paul Jones.\n\nDistrust Democrats, distrust Republicans\n\nThese Americans don\u2019t trust the Democrats\u2019 big government agenda or the Republicans\u2019 ties to corporate America. And amid economic hardship, they\u2019ve been unsettled by seismic changes to the country\u2019s social fabric, such as the Supreme Court\u2019s legalization of gay marriage.\n\nMany \u201charbor enormous skepticism toward government,\u201d Professor Hacker adds. \u201cTheir despair is driven by the fact that they don\u2019t think the private economy can provide them the opportunities they need. They\u2019re seeing communal institutions eroding. Yet they don\u2019t have any faith that government can offer something positive in response.\u201d\n\nThe politics of the presidential campaign so far \u201csuggests a real fundamental disconnect between aggregate economic conditions of the country and the experience\u201d of this stalled generation of white, largely blue-collar workers, Hacker says.\n\nThe broad picture, of course, is fretted with nuance.\n\nThe general South has welcomed millions of residents from bluer states, lured by promises of inexpensive housing and greater spending power. In that way, red America has become a relative land of opportunity for the economy\u2019s refugees, providing a semblance of economic equality for many poorer Americans, whether white Republicans or black Democrats.\n\n\u201cRed states, like Texas, Georgia and Utah, have done a better job over all of offering a higher standard of living relative to housing costs,\u201d wrote demographer Richard Florida in January in a New York Times opinion article. \u201cThat basic economic fact not only helps explain why the nation\u2019s electoral map got so much redder in the [2014] midterm elections, but also why America\u2019s prosperity is in jeopardy.\u201d\n\nBut it is also in red states where safety nets are weakest \u2013 often at the behest of voters. On Tuesday, for example, Kentucky voters elected a new governor who promised to roll back Obamacare, despite the fact that the state\u2019s uninsured rate has fallen by half since the program began.\n\nMany conservative Americans have seen their safety net not in individuals or in states, but in the interconnectedness of the relatively stable and affluent communities that directly surround them, argues Yuval Levin, a fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center and co-author of \u201cRoom to Grow,\u201d a call for Republicans to pay more attention to the needs of the working class.\n\n\u201cThat kind of bottom-up common life, rather than massive, distant systems of material provisions, is [for them] what makes society tick,\u201d Mr. Levin writes in the National Review.\n\nIt's not 'them' anymore\n\nBut that worldview is under strain.\n\nThe Republican push to cut government spending and help business has meant \u201cmore risk has been shifting from employers and government to the backs of individuals and families,\u201d says Mark Rank, a sociologist at Washington University in St. Louis and author of \u201cLiving on the Edge: The Realities of Welfare in America.\u201d \u201cThat means we need to shift our framework from thinking of it as \u2018them\u2019 [who are needing help] to thinking it\u2019s \u2018us.\u2019 The fact is, it\u2019s middle America that is really experiencing some hard times.\u201d\n\nFor Mr. Jones, the poultry dealer, the struggle of young people without a college degree in his rural town to find full-time work is a symptom both of economic and cultural tides. Work habits dull for the underemployed. Young, idle men struggle to find life partners, or even get their own place. In the absence of meaning, drugs and alcohol are a potent lure.\n\nJones spent eight years as part of his children\u2019s high school band program and frequently sees recent graduates in his small town of Mansfield. \u201cI ask them, \u2018What are you up to?\u2019 and they say, \u2018I\u2019m working down at the fast-food place.\u2019 \u2018I thought you went to college?\u2019 \u2018I did, but it\u2019s still the only job I could find.\u2019 \u201d\n\nThere are signs that, under these stresses, Republican orthodoxy is fracturing. Last year, Gallup found that 45 percent of Republicans think rich people should pay more in taxes. The poll also found that more than half of all Republicans support increasing government spending on Medicare, education, Social Security, and road infrastructure over cutting government programs.\n\nThe same trends are apparent among Democrats, too. Vermont\u2019s Bernie Sanders is pitching \u201cdemocratic socialism\u201d designed to improve the lot of poorer Americans, and Hillary Clinton is appealing directly to working-class outcasts from the economy. But the red state working class is not rushing to Democrats, it\u2019s turning its ire on the Republican establishment, and Trump has been their standard-bearer.\n\nHe is \u201can emblem of success, and \u2026 he taps people\u2019s anger,\u201d University of Akron political scientist John Green told the New Yorker. But, he added, \u201cit\u2019s not the same anger as a few years ago, when it was, \u2018Where are the jobs?\u2019 Now it\u2019s \u2018Where\u2019s our share of the American dream?\u2019 \u201d", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.content.id": "479e4d7b536bcd1abcd207751a919c0a", "sailthru.author": "Patrik Jonsson", "description": "There is growing evidence that many Americans \u2013 particularly working-class whites in red states \u2013 are struggling to survive and have lost faith in the American government's ability to help.", "sailthru.image.std": "http://images.csmonitor.com/csm/2015/11/946294_1_1105-South-Trump-voter_standard.jpg?alias=standard_380x253", "author": "The Christian Science Monitor", "og": {"site_name": "The Christian Science Monitor", "description": "There is growing evidence that many Americans \u2013 particularly working-class whites in red states \u2013 are struggling to survive and have lost faith in the American government's ability to help.", "title": "America's red state crisis", "url": "http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Politics/2015/1105/America-s-red-state-crisis", "image": "http://images.csmonitor.com/csm/2015/11/946294_1_1105-South-Trump-voter_standard.jpg?alias=standard_900x600", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@csmonitor", "image": "http://images.csmonitor.com/csm/2015/11/946294_1_1105-South-Trump-voter_standard.jpg?alias=standard_380x253", "description": "There is growing evidence that many Americans \u2013 particularly working-class whites in red states \u2013 are struggling to survive and have lost faith in the American government's ability to help.", "card": "summary", "title": "America's red state crisis"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-11-05", "DC.date.issued": "2015-11-05T18:13:55-05:00", "fb": {"page_id": 14660729657, "app_id": 179793002061452}, "sailthru.content.body": "http://www.csmonitor.com/layout/set/rssfull/USA/Politics/2015/1105/America-s-red-state-crisis", "sailthru.tags": "section-politics,section-usa,class-article,storysource-monitor,brand-ump", "article": {"section": "Politics", "published_time": "2015-11-05T18:13-05"}, "copyright": "The Christian Science Monitor", "sailthru.image.credit": "John Amis/AP"}, "article_summary": "But the red state working class is not rushing to Democrats, it\u2019s turning its ire on the Republican establishment, and Trump has been their standard-bearer.\nThere is growing evidence that many Americans \u2013 particularly working-class whites in red states \u2013 are struggling to survive and have lost faith in the American government's ability to help.\nIn that way, red America has become a relative land of opportunity for the economy\u2019s refugees, providing a semblance of economic equality for many poorer Americans, whether white Republicans or black Democrats.\n\u201cRed states, like Texas, Georgia and Utah, have done a better job over all of offering a higher standard of living relative to housing costs,\u201d wrote demographer Richard Florida in January in a New York Times opinion article.\nFor months, the real estate tycoon has sat atop Republican presidential polls to the befuddlement of the political universe."}
