Businesses with more than 50 employees must start providing health insurance by 2016. Employers with 100 or more employees must provide health benefits to at least 70 percent of workers by 2015 and 95 percent by 2016.\n\nAlso, approximately 1 million more people are on Medicaid than before ACA was made law.\n\n\u201cInsurance companies have had a good run,\u201d he said, but added that the coming decrease in insurance company profits likely will be countered with lower reimbursement to hospitals.\n\nPressure on premiums will continue to change the lives of doctors and hospitals.\n\nSome doctors will join large medical groups and become affiliated with private health insurers, perhaps no longer accepting Medicare and Medicaid patients.\n\nHospitals, including KAH, are using strategies to weather reimbursement inequity.\n\nSome of those strategies include cost reduction, better risk management (cutting down on Medicare fraud), better alignment of physicians and growth.\n\n\u201cGovernment payers and insurance companies want hospitals to demonstrate value,\u201d Whiting said.\n\nKeokuk Area Hospital is working on growing its surgery capabilities \u2013 general and orthopedic; growing its mid-level providers; and growing access to primary care physicians.\n\nHowever, the price tag on family physicians can be $250,000 per year and up.\n\nThe hospital has shed departments that are not high performers. The obstetric-gynecological department was closed in 2013, and specialized urology services ceased this year.\n\nShort-term goals are to increase patient volume, meet clinical goals and provide better patient services.\n\nWhiting and others in the Fitch Healthcare Group also are evaluating possible partnerships with University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics \u2013 including telemedicine services.\n\n\u201cClearly our long-term goal is to be sustainable,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Gate City, Keokuk, Iowa", "description": "Keokuk Area Hospital interim CEO and chief turnaround officer Joseph Whiting, a senior consultant with Fitch Healthcare, Thursday delivered his perspective of health care trends and their effect on the hospital.", "title": "Keokuk Area Hospital readying for continued reimbursement decreases", "url": "http://www.dailygate.com/news/article_8ef995ae-0e8f-11e4-bcab-001a4bcf887a.html", "image": {"width": 300, "identifier": "http://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/dailygate.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/a/73/a7340cda-0e8f-11e4-b308-001a4bcf887a/53c93c8bb09f1.preview-300.jpg?resize=300%2C472", "height": 472}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@DailyGateCity", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"app_id": 176402672418420}, "keywords": "news", "news_keywords": "news", "description": "Keokuk Area Hospital interim CEO and chief turnaround officer Joseph Whiting, a senior consultant with Fitch Healthcare, Thursday delivered his perspective of health care trends and their effect on the hospital."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdeb04\"", "article_summary": "The numbers of insureds will grow when the Affordable Care Act mandated employer health care for workers goes into effect in 2015.\nKeokuk Area Hospital interim CEO and chief turnaround officer Joseph Whiting, a senior consultant with Fitch Healthcare, Thursday delivered his perspective of health care trends and their effect on the hospital.\nBusinesses with more than 50 employees must start providing health insurance by 2016.\nKeokuk Area Hospital is working on growing its surgery capabilities \u2013 general and orthopedic; growing its mid-level providers; and growing access to primary care physicians.\nSpeaking during the Keokuk Rotary Club meeting, Whiting said Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement amounts will continue to decline due in part to the high level of national health care spending that cannot be maintained."}
