The Provider One system was built and is operated by CNSI.\n\n\"We partnered with Washington State HCA to develop and are now maintaining their cutting-edge MMIS, which supports the state's Medicaid program needs. We are proud to be part of the team that reached this extraordinary milestone,\" said B. Chatterjee, CEO of CNSI. \"Our system is proving to be a valuable asset to the state by utilizing state-of-the-art technology that meets the needs of more than a million health care beneficiaries and their continuously changing demands.\"\n\n\"We are very pleased to be one of the leading states that is innovating to create not only a modern system, but a better value for Medicaid beneficiaries,\" said Cathie Ott, director of the Division of Program and Payment Integrity at the Health Care Authority. \"CNSI has been a valuable partner throughout this process and we look forward to continuing to work together on this initiative.\"\n\nThe system updates make HCA a national leader amongst state Medicaid programs in adopting and implementing the Phase III CORE rules, which streamline Electronic Funds Transfer and Electronic Remittance Advice processes.
