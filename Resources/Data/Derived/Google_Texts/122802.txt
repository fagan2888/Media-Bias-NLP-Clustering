The Washington Post ’s “On Parenting” blogger Amy Joyce interviewed Reason’s Lenore Skenazy about the success of the Free-Range Kids movement:

How has this all changed since you first sent your 9-year-old on the subway? There’s a lot more discussion about childhood freedom. Where it went and how we can get it back. I think the thing that I brought to public attention is this government angle. The idea that helicopter parenting was becoming law of the land, rather than just a choice. And that’s changed. There’s constant attention to this now in public and it’s a more fevered pitch. I just think that everybody gets now what I’m saying. For two years in a row after I started this site, I was voted as the most controversial mommy blogger by Babble. I’m not that controversial anymore. I read a lot of articles and everyone sounds like me.

Are there parameters for free-rangers? I think parents are the best judge of that. Certainly there are entire continents who send their children at age 7 to school alone. The idea is we do know what’s best for our kids. My parameter is that unless a child is in obvious immediate and grave danger, we’re allowed to teach our kids the same lessons our parents taught us: Cross the street safely. You can talk to strangers, but don’t go off with strangers.
