The loss of these residents, many of whom left permanently to live in other states, changed the character of the city.\n\nWe hope low-income residents affected by the historic flooding in Colorado this month don\u2019t face the same hardships. As The Associated Press reported last week, there is concern over whether towns in the foothills like Lyons and Jamestown will be affordable for some poor residents whose homes were destroyed or damaged in the floods.\n\nIn Lyons, as in a number of other towns, there exists a distinct divide in lifestyles between poorer residents who lived in trailer parks in low-lying areas and more affluent residents who live on hillsides.\n\nThe AP reported that the number of renters in Lyons fell by half between 2000 and 2010, while the number paying more than $1,500 a month quadrupled. Meanwhile, census data showed the median price of a home in the town rose by 71 percent to $340,000.\n\nThe town\u2019s trailer parks were hit by heavy flooding, and there is talk about whether rebuilding should be allowed in flood-prone areas. That\u2019s understandable, but flood-prone areas are where some of the cheapest land is, so there may be little incentive to rebuild affordable housing elsewhere.\n\nAffordable housing is already so scarce in some communities, lotteries are held to select buyers.\n\nOfficials with the state Division of Housing say they are still formulating a plan to assist those displaced by the flooding, but they have identified nearly 1,300 low-income households that have applied for disaster assistance. On an immediate level, that will mean help in getting temporary accommodations.\n\nBut long-term, division officials say, they hope to work with local communities on rebuilding or relocating low-income housing.\n\nWe hope state and local officials make every effort to ensure the working-class families, retirees and the bohemians who flavor Colorado towns have a good shot at staying in the places they call home.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "What will Colorado floods mean for affordable housing?", "title": "What will Colorado floods mean for affordable housing?", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2013/09/27/what-will-colorado-floods-mean-for-affordable-housing/", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20130927__Colorado-floods-housingp1-1.jpg", "height": 399}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20130927__Colorado-floods-housingp1-1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2013-09-27T11:52:48+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-29T11:30:45+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc961f\"", "article_summary": "One of the most unfortunate and long-lasting consequences of Hurricane Katrina\u2019s aftermath in 2005 was the effect on affordable housing in New Orleans.\nAffordable housing is already so scarce in some communities, lotteries are held to select buyers.\nWe hope low-income residents affected by the historic flooding in Colorado this month don\u2019t face the same hardships.\nBut long-term, division officials say, they hope to work with local communities on rebuilding or relocating low-income housing.\nThat\u2019s understandable, but flood-prone areas are where some of the cheapest land is, so there may be little incentive to rebuild affordable housing elsewhere."}
