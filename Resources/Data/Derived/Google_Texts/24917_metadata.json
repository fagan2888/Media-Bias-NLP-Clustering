We went around downtown Manhattan to find out, just in time for Be Kind to Humankind Week. Tommy Hawkins/Medical Daily\n\nLorraine Jara, 57, believes you can change the world with kindness.\n\nIn 1988, after reading two passing boaters didn\u2019t \u201cwant to be bothered\u201d with young men in an overturned rowboat (the one young man later died), Jara was angry. She wondered what she could do to remind people of the importance of kindness when she settled on Be Kind to Humankind Week, now through Aug. 31. There\u2019s Be Kind to Animals Week, so why not designate one for humans?\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to believe you can do a little bit and it changes the world, but I don\u2019t know,\u201d she told Medical Daily. \u201cIf you stop to think about it, if you do things in your own life and communities to be kind, it would really make for a different world.\u201d\n\nJara initially spread word of her campaign by hand; she wrote letters to her favorite celebrities to see if they would promote kindness on their platform, receiving her fair share of signed and copied form letters. Eventually, as technology improved, her message started to spread. Then, in 1995, the non-profit Random Acts of Foundation was founded and kindness started to catch everyone\u2019s attention, including Oprah (who personalized her response to Jara way back when).\n\nIt\u2019s not just Oprah. Recent studies published in The Journal of Happiness, Nature Neuroscience, and the Journal of Social Psychology has found kindness can lead to greater health and happiness. Good deeds make people feel good, even when performed for as little as 10 days. They help cultivate new connections in the part of the brain associated with happiness and enhance well-being. One study from Emory University even found being kind releases endorphins, the same chemicals that are linked to runner\u2019s high. So a helper\u2019s high, if you will.\n\nGiven Jara\u2019s week of kindness and some pretty convincing science, we decided to put it to the test. And what could be kinder than buying a few unsuspecting New Yorkers their afternoon green juice?\n\nWe set out on a humid Monday afternoon to buy (if only slightly ambush) New Yorkers lined up at food carts for an afternoon snack, from green juice to ice cream. It wasn\u2019t without hesitation, but each person allowed us to pay for their snack and remind them something as small as this can have a big effect. Perhaps surprisingly each person suggested they would return the favor by paying it forward. Everyone knew how great it was to be kind \u2014 they just needed a little reminder. (We still feel bad about that snow cone, though.)\n\nThe point is, we see what Jara is saying. We may have only made a small, local effort to be kinder to the people we\u2019ve likely been smashed up against on the subway, but the payoff has potential to be huge. If everyone pays forward a random act of kindness, imagine how long before everyone shows kindness when they can do it without being reminded it\u2019s just the healthy and happy thing to do?\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just like anybody else,\u201d Jara said. \u201cI can be grumpy and in my own little world. But rather than be in my own world, I\u2019m going to try to promote kindness each day. It\u2019s not fancy stuff, but it\u2019s a good thing. We can\u2019t always be up, but we can help each other get through each day in a positive manner. What goes around will come back without even having to look for it.\u201d\n\nNow it\u2019s your turn. All week long we\u2019re celebrating kindness on our social channels, and we want to know how you show kindness toward both yourself and others.
