The site largely was empty, its restrooms were locked and its fountains were dormant.\n\nIt was a different scene on Saturday. There was not a fence in sight, sunshine was emerging, the fountains were dancing, and dozens of volunteers and tourists applauded as 29 old-timers emerged from their bus and walked or were wheeled onto the monument plaza.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m enjoying every bit of it,\u201d said Glen Thompson, 94, of Henderson, whose memory was sparked by the 17-foot-tall granite pillars and the two triumphal arches erected in salute to the 16 million who served and the 400,000 who died.\n\nThompson had completed Army training three months earlier and was stationed in Cheyenne, Wyo., when officers interrupted church service on Dec. 7, 1941, and ordered all servicemen back to base.\n\n\u201cEverybody in the audience started clapping for us,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is something I will never forget.\u201d Thompson\u2019s unit hurriedly was dispatched to the devastation at Pearl Harbor.\n\n\u201cI could see the damage,\u201d he said. \u201cThey were putting up barbed wire on the beaches and evacuating the Japanese.\u201d A local college was converted into a 2,000-bed hospital. Thompson remembered working in the hospital receiving office and six months later meeting the ships returning with the wounded from the Battle of Midway.\n\nThompson later traveled widely when he served as secretary to four-star Gen. Clark Ruffner, deputy chief of staff for the Pacific and then Army chief of staff later in the war.\n\nSo far 110 Southern Nevada veterans from World War II have traveled to the nation\u2019s capital over three trips organized by a network that raises money and arranges \u201ctours of honor\u201d for the rapidly aging \u201cGreatest Generation\u201d\n\nSaturday\u2019s tour also included stops at Arlington National Cemetery, the monuments commemorating the Korean and Vietnam wars, and memorials to the Air Force, Navy and Marine Corps.\n\nKatherine Burt of Las Vegas, who enlisted in the Women\u2019s Army Corps when she was 20 and living in Minneapolis, was to present a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier.\n\nBelinda Morse, chairwoman of Honor Flight Southern Nevada, said there are at least 50 more World War II veterans on a waiting list for future trips, as well as a growing number of Korean War veterans. She said the organization intended to keep putting the trips together as long as the community continues its support. A companion group puts together trips for Northern Nevada veterans.\n\n\u201cAs long as we can raise the funds, we\u2019ll come back,\u201d Morse said.\n\nAbout 9,940 World War II veterans are living in Nevada, according to the Department of Veterans Affairs. Nationwide the VA estimates 1.034 million veterans of the war are still alive, but they are dying at a rate of 555 each day.\n\nAt the memorial, the veterans were welcomed by Brig. Gen. Robert Herbert, assistant adjutant general in the Nevada Army National Guard and a senior policy adviser to Sen. Harry Reid, D-Nev. Herbert distributed U.S. Senate \u201cchallenge coins\u201d minted for Reid.\n\nRichard G. Miller of Las Vegas was surrounded by a large group of family at the memorial who listened intently as he talked of his service. Growing up in Los Angeles, Miller got an \u201cearly start\u201d on the war when he enlisted at 16. He was piloting a Curtiss SB2C Helldiver dive bomber on its way to attack Tokyo when he got word the war was over and had to turn back.\n\n\u201cOh yeah, I felt relieved,\u201d said Miller, now 89. \u201cMy best buddy growing up was a Japanese boy and I didn\u2019t want to go over there and bomb them.\u201d\n\nCarl \u201cCurly\u201d Price, 88, who was a butcher in the Seabees and who spent 11 months in New Guinea during the war, said the greeting he received at the memorial \u201cis the greatest thing I\u2019ve had happen since I got out of the service.\u201d\n\nPrice said he hopes that soldiers who served in Iraq and Afghanistan are as fondly remembered when they grow old.\n\n\u201cWhat I would like to do is give the next bunch that comes the same treatment as we\u2019ve gotten,\u201d Price said. \u201cIt would be great.\u201d\n\nContact Stephens Washington Bureau Chief Steve Tetreault at stetreault@stephensmedia.com or 202-783-1760.
