But McBride, a Loghill Mesa resident and the former Development Officer of the Montrose Regional Library, had hesitated to quit her job. The library has a good group health care plan, and she figured the cost of paying an individual policy would be too expensive.\n\nShe was wrong.\n\nMcBride is friends with a Montrose-based employee of Connect for Colorado, the state\u2019s insurance marketplace, who helped McBride pick out a new plan; it turned out that McBride\u2019s reduced income from quitting her job would actually help her qualify for a tax subsidy to cover the cost of insuring herself. Suddenly, individual insurance became affordable.\n\n\u201cThis was a very important factor in my decision to leave the library,\u201d said McBride, who quit her job in December. The library had offered McBride a temporary fix: a chance to jump on its COBRA plan, which had premiums of $400 a month. But in her new plan through Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield, McBride pays premiums of just $109 a month \u2013\u2013 a savings of more than 70 percent. Her newfound financial freedom has allowed her to take not one, but two fulfilling new jobs: writing grants for the Passage Charter School and working on the Sherbino Theater\u2019s capital campaign. \u201cI can afford my own insurance and still manage to make a living,\u201d McBride said.\n\nSeven miles away, in downtown Ridgway, business leadership and development consultant Beth Jones is living a different experience from Amy McBride. Like McBride, Jones purchases her own insurance \u2013\u2013 but because she earns more than McBride does, she doesn\u2019t qualify for any subsidies. Jones used an insurance broker she trusts to help pick a plan on the state\u2019s exchange, but because of Jones\u2019s income, the best plan they came up with still costs Jones $900 a month. And that is with a $5,000 deductible.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a staunch Democrat, but I will say the Affordable Care Act is flawed,\u201d Jones said. \u201cPeople like me are caught in the middle. I\u2019m a hard-working American, but I make too much to qualify for subsidies\u201d to help lower the cost of insurance. In effect, \u201cI own a very expensive version of catastrophic insurance,\u201d she added. \u201cI\u2019m happy with it as long as I don\u2019t have to use it. I am no more likely to go to the doctor now than ever before.\u201d\n\nThey may live in the same town, but when it comes to health insurance purchased on the state\u2019s exchange, McBride and Jones occupy different worlds. Colorado received $148 million in federal funds to open its insurance marketplace and returned over $250 million in tax credits the first year alone, said Linda Gann, senior manager of Connect for Health on the Western Slope. She understands Beth Jones\u2019s point of view.\n\nA lot of people have expressed concern about the matter of those who receive subsidies versus those who do not, Gann said. \u201cI suggest those who don\u2019t qualify for tax credits speak to their legislators, and see if there is a chance that the law might be expanded\u201d to include everyone who purchases insurance, since everyone who works must either have it or pay a penalty.\n\nRegardless of where you stand on the ACA and how fair it may or may not seem, one thing is certain: the last chance to enroll for coverage will soon be here. The final day to purchase health insurance on the exchange is Jan. 31 for coverage that begins March 1. There are exceptions: people who have a significant \u201clife event\u201d (getting divorced, losing a job, getting married or having a baby all qualify) can purchase insurance anytime. And last week, it was announced that individuals and families who owned plans in 2015 that no longer exist \u2013\u2013 such as Colorado HealthOP, the state\u2019s co-operative plan \u2013\u2013 or whose plans no longer meet minimum legal requirements have until Feb. 29 to purchase new coverage. Everybody else (who isn\u2019t already insured through an employer) must either purchase a plan or pay a tax penalty. The fees for inaction are getting steeper: this year, penalties will be at least $695 per person. Experts estimate the fees for not getting coverage will work out to be over $1,000 per household.\n\nA penalty isn\u2019t enough to induce Montrose full-time college student Trenci Towner, who also has a part-time job, to purchase insurance. \u201cI\u2019m healthy enough that I don\u2019t need to this year,\u201d Towner said. \u201cI know something crazy could happen to me, like I could be in a car accident. But I\u2019m willing to take that risk.\u201d\n\nOther young people see things differently. Spencer Mack, a supervisor at the Telluride Ski School, is very concerned about owning health insurance because of his active lifestyle. \u201cAlmost my entire life is spent outdoors,\u201d he pointed out. \u201cI ski in the winter, and I\u2019m a fly-fishing guide and rafting guide in the summer. I want coverage in case I get injured in a very outdoorsy job.\u201d\n\nAccording to a report released last month by the nonprofit Colorado Health Institute, the number of uninsured statewide has fallen from 14.3 percent, in 2013, to just 6.7 percent last year. A closer look at the numbers revealed that 443 \u201czip codes registered a decline in the probability of being uninsured between 2013 and 2015,\u201d the report said. Just 15 zip codes \u201chave a higher probability than two years ago.\u201d The biggest improvement in the number of insured, the report found, was in Antonito in the San Luis Valley, which fell from 31 percent to 2.3 percent (on the flip side, Wray, Colorado, on the eastern plains, doubled its odds of being uninsured, to 14.3 percent from 7 percent over the same period).\n\nCloser to home, in so-called Region 10 counties (Delta, Gunnison, Hinsdale, Montrose, Ouray and San Miguel), the employer-based insurance rate remained stable, the report found, and there was a \u201cslight decrease\u201d in individual coverage. The Affordable Care Act expanded Medicaid eligibility in states that chose to take advantage of it (Colorado was one). Between 2013 and 2015, the number of residents with Medicaid in Region 10 counties more than doubled.\n\nThis is the third year individual insurance has been available through Colorado\u2019s exchange. Yet choosing a plan is no less confounding than before; indeed, it may more confusing than ever. \u201cUnderstanding insurance is really challenging,\u201d says Stacey Wright, an insurance navigator with the Tri-County Network, who helps residents of this region find coverage. That\u2019s an understatement. As the box on page 11 shows, new insurance plans available in this region appear, and others disappear, every year. At the same time, rates are fluctuating, providers (meaning doctors and hospitals) are changing, and prescription coverage is shifting. And that\u2019s not to mention the struggles some people, such as Telluride\u2019s Spencer Mack, encounter when signing up on the state\u2019s exchange. \u201cIt\u2019s a complicated process, and there have been problems,\u201d acknowledges Telluride insurance broker Brett Borup. \u201cAnd those problems have driven people to seek out help.\u201d\n\nAccording to Borup, \u201cThe past two years have definitely been busier than year one.\u201d Last year, \u201cA lot of the problems were just getting through the system. Determining eligibility.\u201d This go-round, Borup says, people have sought help because their insurance company essentially evanesced, which forced them to return to the marketplace (such was the case for both Beth Jones and Spencer Mack, who owned insurance through the Colorado Co-Op, which went belly up in December). In addition, Borup says, \u201cThere are a lot more plan choices this year. Anthem Blue Cross rolled out a bunch of different plans.\u201d\n\nThe best way to make sense of the changes when you are signing up, experts agree, is to get help. If you want to keep your plan from last year, you have the option of doing nothing, and it will automatically renew. But at a minimum, you should double check whether your physician (or physicians) is still on the plan. If there is a doctor you regularly see someplace else in the state (such as a specialist in Denver), check that, too. And if there is a drug you regularly take, ensure your plan still covers it, and how much the plan pays (prescription coverage has changed on Rocky Mountain Health Plans\u2019 HMO this year, for example). \u201cOne thing we\u2019ve learned in the short time the exchange has been operating is that most shoppers choose a plan by price; it\u2019s the premium, above all, that matters to them,\u201d says Connect for Colorado\u2019s Director of Communication, Luke Clarke.\n\nThis may not be the smartest way to pick a plan, though. \u201cWe counsel people to take a look at the whole picture,\u201d Clarke said. \u201cFor example, if you\u2019ve got a chronic condition and take medications for it, your premium may be low, but the savings may be entirely eaten up by how much you pay for your prescriptions. The other thing is, you want to be sure if you have a relationship with your doctor, that he or she is still in the network of the carrier you chose. Just because they were in last year doesn\u2019t mean they will be this year. As companies try to control their costs, the network of doctors you can choose from can become smaller, because fewer doctors may be willing to accept what the company will pay for reimbursement.\u201d There are tools on the Connect for Health website, at connectforhealthco.com, to help you determine which doctors are in a carrier\u2019s network, and what drugs it covers. Clarke says the exchange updates this information every few weeks.\n\nThe best of advice of all may be to take Clarke\u2019s suggestion and seek help. \u201cHealth insurance is a complicated product, and it costs you nothing to seek out help,\u201d he says. Insurance navigators (also available through Connect\u2019s website, under connectforhealthco./com/person-help) can help you narrow down the choices, and describe the plans, said Stacey Wright. \u201cBut we can\u2019t give you advice. Only a licensed broker can.\u201d Brokers receive compensation from the carriers; there is no charge for their advice.\n\nSpencer Mack sought out assistance from the TriCounty Health Network when the Colorado Co-Op advised him it was going out of business.\n\n\u201cI had a short time to sort this all out, and I was a little freaked,\u201d he recalls, but the navigators were wonderful. \u201cThey kept in close touch with me every step of the way. Their help was invaluable.\u201d\n\nA Telluride business owner who declined to be identified because the Affordable Care Act is \u201ca political hot potato\u201d also used TriCounty\u2019s assistance to help him pick a plan. \u201cIt was a great experience,\u201d he said. \u201cThey were super willing to work around my schedule.\u201d\n\nOn the other hand, Beth Jones of Ridgway purchased an exchange plan through her broker. She was very satisfied with his assistance; with the ACA itself, not so much. Jones has a pre-existing condition; under the terms of the ACA, she cannot be denied coverage.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m thankful for the safety net,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it comes at a cost.\u201d\n\nThis is the first of a two-part story.", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "news_keywords": "the_watch,the_lead,spotlight", "og": {"site_name": "Telluride Daily Planet", "description": "Part 1: Navigating the Marketplace", "title": "Covering Colorado", "url": "http://www.telluridenews.com/the_watch/article_d5c3495c-c069-11e5-b5a3-4bbd1a120aa5.html", "image": {"width": 620, "identifier": "http://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/telluridenews.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/0/71/071be5e0-c06a-11e5-9012-5f1e60e8d0ad/56a11ecf30aa3.image.jpg?resize=620%2C400", "height": 400}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@TelluridePlanet", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"app_id": 310347052497473}, "keywords": "the_watch,the_lead,spotlight", "description": "Part 1: Navigating the Marketplace"}, "article_summary": "Spencer Mack, a supervisor at the Telluride Ski School, is very concerned about owning health insurance because of his active lifestyle.\nLike McBride, Jones purchases her own insurance \u2013\u2013 but because she earns more than McBride does, she doesn\u2019t qualify for any subsidies.\nAnd that\u2019s not to mention the struggles some people, such as Telluride\u2019s Spencer Mack, encounter when signing up on the state\u2019s exchange.\n\u201cThey were super willing to work around my schedule.\u201dOn the other hand, Beth Jones of Ridgway purchased an exchange plan through her broker.\nThe final day to purchase health insurance on the exchange is Jan. 31 for coverage that begins March 1."}
