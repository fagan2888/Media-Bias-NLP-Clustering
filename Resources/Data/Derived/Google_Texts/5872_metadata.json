View Full Caption DNAInfo/Heather Cherone\n\nPORTAGE PARK \u2014 Our Lady of the Resurrection Medical Center is for sale, Presence Health officials said Thursday.\n\nNo buyer has been identified but officials expressed confidence it would be sold even though the Northwest Side hospital has been losing money for years.\n\nBecause of what officials called \"dramatic changes in the health care landscape,\" the Portage Park hospital is on track to lose $20 million in 2014 after losing $9.8 million in 2013 and $12.5 million in 2012. The losses came despite extensive cost-cutting efforts, officials said.\n\nA proposal in October by Our Lady of the Resurrection's owners, Presence Health, to shutter the hospital \u2014 but to keep the emergency room open \u2014 prompted an outcry from local elected officials and employees, who said the closure would turn Portage Park into a \"health care desert.\"\n\nAld. Tim Cullerton, whose 38th Ward includes the hospital, said Presence Health officials told him Thursday they planned to ensure that the new owner of Our Lady of the Resurrection would keep it open as a full-service medical center.\n\n\"I hope the sale turns out to be a good thing,\" Cullerton said.\n\nDr. David Fishman, the director of the cardiology department who helped lead employee opposition to the proposed closure of the hospital, said a sale could benefit both patients and employees.\n\n\"I hope the new owner will invest in the building and expand service to the community,\" Fishman said. \"It could be a good thing for everyone in the long run.\"\n\nPresence Health officials plan to sell the 269-bed hospital at 5645 W. Addison St. by the beginning of the summer and complete the transaction by the end of the year.\n\nAny sale would have to be approved by the Presence Health board of directors, which operates 12 Catholic hospitals in the Chicago area including Our Lady of the Resurrection, as well as state regulatory officials.\n\nPresence Health CEO Sandra Bruce said a Catholic health system or hospital would be given preference over other potential buyers. In addition, a bid for the hospital from a not-for-profit firm would be preferred to one from a for-profit group, she said.\n\nIn addition, the new owner of the hospital will be required to keep Our Lady of the Resurrection open as a general acute care medical center and to retain the hospital's 900 employees, Bruce said.\n\nThe hospital's serious financial challenges are due to the declining number of people being admitted to a hospital \u2014 an industrywide trend \u2014 and the high number of uninsured patients who seek treatment at Our Lady of the Resurrection, Bruce said.\n\nThe hospital's small size has made it difficult for Our Lady of the Resurrection to weather these changes, Bruce said.\n\nEighty percent of the hospital's patients were covered by Medicare or Medicaid, or paid out of pocket, according to the hospital\u2019s 2011 report to the Illinois Department of Public Health.\n\nWhile more people will be eligible for health care insurance under the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, the relatively low number of eligible people enrolling in the program means that while the law could reduce the red ink at the hospital, it would not be \"enough to stem the losses,\" Bruce said.\n\nA nearly yearlong review process of the hospital's financial health found that none of the options considered by the hospital's leaders were viable, including the proposal to close the hospital but keep the emergency room open, Bruce said.\n\nEvery year, more than 47,000 people visit Our Lady of the Resurrection\u2019s emergency room, about 9,000 people are hospitalized there, and 3,600 patients undergo surgery at the hospital, which has been open since 1955, according to data provided by Fishman.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "description": "The medical center is on track to lose $20 million in 2014, Presence Health officials said.", "application-name": "DNAinfo", "og": {"url": "https://www.dnainfo.com/chicago/20140320/portage-park/our-lady-of-resurrection-hospital-be-sold", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "https://assets.dnainfo.com/generated/chicago_photo/2013/10/our-lady-of-resurrection-1381502976.JPG/extralarge.jpg", "height": 400}, "site_name": "DNAinfo Chicago", "description": "The medical center is on track to lose $20 million in 2014, Presence Health officials said.", "title": "Our Lady of the Resurrection Hospital For Sale"}, "referrer": "always", "twitter": {"site": "@DNAinfoCHI", "card": "summary"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "DNAinfo", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "//fluffyclouds.dnainfo.com/img/common/mstile-70x70px.png", "robots": "noarchive,noodp,noydir", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "//fluffyclouds.dnainfo.com/img/common/mstile-310x310.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "//fluffyclouds.dnainfo.com/img/common/mstile-310x150.png", "fb": {"admins": "54902139,1379988119,575522805,108424,5519941,48600120,112261,662865465", "app_id": 153948644632011}, "viewport": "width=device-width", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "keywords": "Portage Park,Health & Wellness,Presence Health,health care costs,Tim Cullerton,Sandra Bruce,David Fishman,Our Lady of the Resurrection Medical Center", "google-site-verification": "AYA-4dHbK-igtSqpqIYyKuCbHO3o3KourjkrAnfCeZc", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "//fluffyclouds.dnainfo.com/img/common/mstile-150x150.png", "googletag": {"topic": "health-wellness", "tags": "health-care-costs,presence-health", "places": "our-lady-of-resurrection-medical-center", "people": "tim-cullerton,david-fishman,sandra-bruce"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fded51\"", "article_summary": "View Full Caption DNAInfo/Heather CheronePORTAGE PARK \u2014 Our Lady of the Resurrection Medical Center is for sale, Presence Health officials said Thursday.\nOur Lady of the Resurrection Medical Center will be sold, Presence Health officials said Thursday.\nPresence Health CEO Sandra Bruce said a Catholic health system or hospital would be given preference over other potential buyers.\nThe hospital's small size has made it difficult for Our Lady of the Resurrection to weather these changes, Bruce said.\nTim Cullerton, whose 38th Ward includes the hospital, said Presence Health officials told him Thursday they planned to ensure that the new owner of Our Lady of the Resurrection would keep it open as a full-service medical center."}
