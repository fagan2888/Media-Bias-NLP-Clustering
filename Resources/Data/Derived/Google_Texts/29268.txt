Stamford, Conn.-based Centerplate, which holds concession and catering contracts at the Colorado Convention Center, Sports Authority Field at Mile High, and the Denver Performing Arts Complex, on Tuesday said CEO Desmond Hague has resigned in the wake of allegations that he mistreated a dog in his care.

Chris Verros has been named president and CEO.

In a statement posted to Centerplate’s website on Wednesday, the company said Hague had been placed on indefinite suspension and, as a condition of future employment, ordered to pay $100,000 to the Sade Foundation to honor of the dog he mistreated and help support the protection and safety of animals in the city of Vancouver, B.C. He also was required to complete 1,000 hours of volunteer service with an animal welfare organization.

Hague may face charges in Vancouver, where he is alleged to have abused a friend’s Doberman puppy in an elevator, the company said.

He was captured on surveillance video kicking the dog and violently yanking on the animal’s leash. The video, which was posted to YouTube, resulted in social-media backlash against the company.

“We want to reiterate that we do not condone nor would we ever overlook the abuse of animals,” said Joe O’Donnell, chairman of the board of directors for Centerplate. “Following an extended review of the incident involving Mr. Hague, I’d like to apologize for the distress that this situation has caused to so many; but also thank our employees, clients and guests who expressed their feelings about this incident. Their voices helped us to frame our deliberations during this very unusual and unfortunate set of circumstances.”

Verros has been Centerplate’s chief operating officer since 2010 and the company said he has helped it achieve unprecedented growth.
