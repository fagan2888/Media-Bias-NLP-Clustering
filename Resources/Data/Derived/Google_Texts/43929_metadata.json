A doctor then performs a short outpatient procedure to remove the mature eggs for freezing. Many doctors recommend freezing 20 eggs, which could require more than one round. The patient can use the eggs at a future date by implanting them through in vitro fertilization.\n\nThe American Society of Reproductive Medicine deemed the practice \u201cexperimental\u201d from 2008 to 2012, when it removed that label. Doctors have noted an increase in people seeking the procedure in the two years since then, according to NBC News.\n\nSome question whether the procedure is reliable, and the American Society of Reproductive Medicine does not have comprehensive statistics on the procedure\u2019s rates of success. Fertility and Sterility reported in 2013 on an analysis of 2,200 freezing and thawing procedures, which found that 31.5 percent of women who froze their eggs at age 25 gave birth, according to The Atlantic. Those success rates dropped for women who froze their eggs at ages 30-40.\n\nEmployers\u2019 coverage of the procedure could signify a cultural shift toward increasing its accessibility for women, Megan Garber wrote at The Atlantic.\n\nBut Amanda Hess refuted this view in an article for Slate.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act does not require companies to cover infertility treatments, but 15 states have laws that mandate insurance coverage for infertility treatments in some circumstances. Some states require a patient to be diagnosed with infertility in order to receive the coverage.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Facebook and Apple are now among the first Silicon Valley tech companies to cover the expense of egg freezing procedures for employees, NBC News reported.", "pubdate": 20141014, "og": {"site_name": "PBS NewsHour", "description": "Facebook and Apple are now among the first Silicon Valley tech companies to cover the expense of egg freezing procedures for employees, NBC News reported.", "title": "Facebook and Apple will pay for employees to freeze their eggs", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://newshour-tc.pbs.org/newshour/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/photos-2013-02-11-facebook-1024x684.jpg", "url": "http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/facebook-apple-will-pay-employees-freeze-eggs/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "PBS NewsHour", "description": "Facebook and Apple are now among the first Silicon Valley tech companies to cover the expense of egg freezing procedures for employees, NBC News reported.", "title": "Facebook and Apple will pay for employees to freeze their eggs", "image": "http://newshour-tc.pbs.org/newshour/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/photos-2013-02-11-facebook-1024x684.jpg", "creator": "@newshour", "site": "@newshour", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "fb": {"app_id": 114150878604116}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/newshour", "tag": "technology"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "apple, facebook, technology"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb562\"", "article_summary": "Both Facebook and Apple will finance up to $20,000 in those costs; Facebook under its \u201csurrogacy benefit\u201d and Apple under its \u201cfertility benefit.\u201d The coverage went into effect for Facebook employees this year.\nFacebook and Apple are now among the first Silicon Valley tech companies to cover the expense of egg freezing procedures for employees, NBC News reported.\nA doctor then performs a short outpatient procedure to remove the mature eggs for freezing.\nMany doctors recommend freezing 20 eggs, which could require more than one round.\nThe process requires patients to undergo ten days of fertility drug injections of follicle stimulating hormones, which prompts the ovaries to release multiple mature eggs."}
