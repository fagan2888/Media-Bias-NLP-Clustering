If confirmed there, Lynch will become the first African-American woman and the first native North Carolinian to serve in that role.\n\nThe daughter of a black Baptist minister and a school librarian who once picked cotton in the eastern part of North Carolina, Lynch made her way from Durham to Brooklyn, where she has twice led the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office.\n\nAs chief there, Lynch earned the respect of law enforcement officials and prosecutors from both sides of the aisle, many of whom voiced support for her nomination at the time of her committee confirmation hearing in January.\n\nAnd prior to the committee vote this morning, even those Republican senators voting \u201cno\u201d on her nomination conceded that she was immensely qualified and had done an impeccable job leading one of the most active and effective U.S. Attorney\u2019s offices in the country.\n\nNone had voiced opposition during Lynch\u2019s confirmation hearing, but in the time since partisan pressure built among Republicans to defeat her nomination.\n\nIn a February 19 letter, fifty-one Republican senators urged Judiciary Committee members to oppose her nomination, saying they suspected that Lynch would likely continue the policies of Eric Holder, whom she\u2019d succeed as Attorney General.", "article_metadata": {"fb": {"pages": 71966175060}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://pulse.ncpolicywatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/cropped-logo_shadow-square-270x270.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fded96\"", "article_summary": "The U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee has approved the nomination of North Carolina native Loretta Lynch to serve as the country\u2019s next Attorney General by a 12-8 vote.\nIf confirmed there, Lynch will become the first African-American woman and the first native North Carolinian to serve in that role.\nWith the committee\u2019s approval, Lynch now moves to a vote by the full Senate, on a date and time yet to be set.\nThe daughter of a black Baptist minister and a school librarian who once picked cotton in the eastern part of North Carolina, Lynch made her way from Durham to Brooklyn, where she has twice led the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office.\nIn a February 19 letter, fifty-one Republican senators urged Judiciary Committee members to oppose her nomination, saying they suspected that Lynch would likely continue the policies of Eric Holder, whom she\u2019d succeed as Attorney General."}
