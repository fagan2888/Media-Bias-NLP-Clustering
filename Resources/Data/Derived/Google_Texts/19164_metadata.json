But the video doesn\u2019t work on me the way it\u2019s supposed to. For many of her fans, Maria\u2019s voice causes a sensation the Internet has dubbed ASMR\u2014autonomous sensory meridian response. Those who get ASMR describe the experience as a tingling inside their heads, or a head rush. Sometimes the sensation extends down their backs or limbs. It\u2019s often referred to as a brain-gasm, but counterintuitively, it\u2019s also supposed to be relaxing, a mellow feeling. Some people watch the videos to help them sleep at night. And even without the tingles, it is sort of relaxing, if you can get past the dissonance of someone whispering in your ear while you scroll through Twitter in your cubicle, or whatever.\n\nAside from whispering, some of the other things that can trigger the sensation include tapping or scratching sounds, the sound of rain, or white noise. And it\u2019s not just sounds: People report getting ASMR when getting a haircut, or an ear exam\u2014any kind of close, personal attention. \u201cWhenever they had lice checks in elementary school, I would feel very relaxed, and would have the tingling sensation run from my head and down my back,\u201d Lee, who works for an advertising agency in New York City, says of her first ASMR experience. For John Skinner, a 23-year-old tutor in Chicago, his introduction to ASMR came from famously-fro\u2019d TV painter Bob Ross. \u201cEvery time I watched it, I would just completely zone out\u2026 I guess I wouldn\u2019t really call it sleepy, more just like very, very mellow,\u201d he says. And he\u2019s not the only one\u2014the subreddit for ASMR lists Bob Ross under \u201cCommon Triggers.\u201d Some people prefer accented voices\u2014Maria is Russian, and moved to the U.S. in 2006. When she heard I was interviewing Maria (YouTube name \u201cGentleWhispering\u201d), Lee got excited. \u201cShe\u2019s my favorite,\u201d Lee said. \u201cIt\u2019s something about the way she pronounces consonants. Her P\u2019s are like cushiony pillows.\u201d Maria says that as soon as she got to the U.S., she began searching for things that triggered her online. The videos she would find then were often not intended to trigger ASMR\u2014it might just be a video of someone explaining something softly. Then, \u201cin 2009, I was going through a depression and I had a lot of problems with anxiety,\u201d Maria says. \u201cI needed something to relax. On YouTube I was watching hypnosis videos, some massage videos as well\u2026then I saw a link that said \u2018whisper video.\u2019\u201d \"The strongest tingle feels like sparkles or little fireworks, and gives you the feeling of being pleasantly exhausted.\" For around a year after that, she was just a viewer, watching the whisper videos every day for hours. \u201cI liked them so much and was so happy that I found my people,\u201d she says. \u201cMy depression totally disappeared.\u201d Then she started making videos herself.\n\nPeople like Maria, who make YouTube videos for ASMR (they call themselves ASMRtists), shape them around different triggers, to try to appeal to different people. Maria has a video in which she plays with a friend\u2019s hair. Other \u201crole-play\u201d videos have a person pretending to do your makeup, or give you an eye exam. According to Maria, the way ASMR manifests is different for everybody. First, there are two types, Type A and Type B. Those with Type A are said to be able to cause ASMR through meditation, or just thinking about a trigger, while Type Bs need to actually experience the trigger. Maria also says that the tingles vary in strength. \u201cThe strongest type of tingle\u2026feels like sparkles or little fireworks going off,\u201d she says. \u201cThe strongest one would give you the feeling of being exhausted, pleasantly tired, satisfied almost you want to say. Then there are much less strong tingles, and they feel just pleasant. Almost like sand is being poured down your spine. [Or] like when you get the funny elbow, when you hit it and it feels like it just goes off everywhere.\u201d Neither Lee nor Skinner had a name for this sensation until recently. \u201cI just thought it was a thing that everybody had,\u201d Skinner says. The community that has sprung up around this specific physical sensation is, perhaps unsurprisingly, Internet-born and bred. It\u2019s also sometimes called \u201cAttention-Induced Euphoria,\u201d though ASMR is the term that has caught on. According to Google, the term first showed up in 2011, increased in search popularity in 2012, and really took off this year. This is just nomenclature, not science. There is currently no published research on ASMR, though that may change soon. At Dartmouth College, Bryson Lochte did an fMRI study on ASMR, which started as his senior honors thesis. \"Even though I\u2019ve never experienced ASMR, I had a gut feeling that [these videos] were doing something unique in the brain,\" Lochte says. \"I became more fascinated by ASMR when I started visiting the forums where posters were reporting euphoric effects, and even therapeutic effects for symptoms of insomnia and anxiety.\"\n\nHe posted earlier this year on the ASMR subreddit, calling for volunteers, and completed the study in May. First, he looked at how ASMR videos affected \"normal people\"\u201418 Dartmouth undergrads. \"In the second study we selected only people we knew could reliably experience and report ASMR,\" he says. \"For this we used 10 subjects, most of whom were people from the subreddit who could commute to Hanover, New Hampshire. In this second study we asked the participants to bring in videos that they knew would trigger their ASMR. They then watched the videos in an MRI, while indicating periods of ASMR with a button press.\" Lochte is currently seeking publication, and says he can\u2019t discuss his results until the study is published in a journal. In 2012, Steven Novella, a neurologist at the Yale University School of Medicine wrote a blog post about ASMR, asking \u201cthe most basic question\u2014is it real? In this case I don\u2019t think there is a definitive answer, but I am inclined to believe that it is\u2026 It\u2019s similar to migraine headaches\u2014we know they exist as a syndrome primarily because many different people report the same constellation of symptoms and natural history.\u201d He goes on to speculate as to what ASMR could be\u2014possibly small seizures, or \u201cjust a way of activating the pleasure response.\u201d Scientists have studied a different type of tingle\u2014the chills that go up and down your spine, often caused by listening to music. Though both sensations can be triggered by sound, the ASMR subreddit is quick to point out that ASMR is \u201cNOT TO BE CONFUSED WITH MUSIC BASED TINGLES/SHIVERS. Those are called frisson and can be discussed in /r/frisson.\u201d \"We are highly sensitive to close stimuli. When someone whispers in your ear, that will certainly grab your attention.\" David Huron, a professor at Ohio State University, has studied music-induced frisson and offered me some \u201cinformal impressions\u201d on ASMR after watching a few videos. \u201cPhysiological arousal (heart rate, respiration, etc.) increases under a number of circumstances,\u201d he wrote in an email. \u201cOne of these is proximity. We are highly sensitive to close stimuli. When someone whispers in your ear, that will certainly quicken your heart rate and grab your attention.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Intimate videos of whispering and tapping fingernails cause pleasurable tingles, or ASMR, for some.", "author": "Julie Beck", "og": {"site_name": "The Atlantic", "description": "Intimate videos of whispering and tapping fingernails cause pleasurable tingles, or ASMR, for some.", "title": "How to Have a 'Brain Orgasm'", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2013/12/5940170219_488645a8a8_b/lead_large.jpg", "url": "http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2013/12/how-to-have-a-brain-orgasm/282356/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "theatlantic.com", "site": "@theatlantic", "card": "summary"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "p": {"domain_verify": "68e1a0361a557708fefc992f3309ed70"}, "fb": {"admins": "577048155,17301937", "page_id": 29259828486, "app_id": 100770816677686}, "keywords": "The Atlantic, The Atlantic Magazine, TheAtlantic.com, Atlantic, news, opinion, breaking news, analysis, commentary, business, politics, culture, international, science, technology, national and life", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, width=device-width, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb5b0\"", "article_summary": "\"Even though I\u2019ve never experienced ASMR, I had a gut feeling that [these videos] were doing something unique in the brain,\" Lochte says.\nFirst, he looked at how ASMR videos affected \"normal people\"\u201418 Dartmouth undergrads.\nIn this second study we asked the participants to bring in videos that they knew would trigger their ASMR.\nAt Dartmouth College, Bryson Lochte did an fMRI study on ASMR, which started as his senior honors thesis.\nAside from whispering, some of the other things that can trigger the sensation include tapping or scratching sounds, the sound of rain, or white noise."}
