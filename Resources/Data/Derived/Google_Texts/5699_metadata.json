He is also older brother to Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel and Hollywood talent agent Ari Emanuel. I sat down with him earlier today.\n\nDr. Zeke Emanuel, thank you for talking with us.\n\nDR. EZEKIEL EMANUEL, University of Pennsylvania: It\u2019s my great pleasure.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: So, you have created quite a stir: \u201cWhy I Want to Die at 75.\u201d\n\nWhy 75? Why not 85? Why not 70?\n\nDR. EZEKIEL EMANUEL: Well, first of all, let\u2019s clarify, I expect to be alive at 75, and I\u2019m not going to kill myself. I don\u2019t believe in legalized euthanasia or assisted suicide, but I am going to stop medical treatments.\n\nAnd I look at 75, when I look at all the data on physical disability, dementia, Alzheimer\u2019s disease, loss of creativity, slowing down of the mind and the body, and 75 seems like that, albeit somewhat arbitrary, moment where you get the maximum chance you\u2019re still going to be vital and alive and vigorous.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: So it\u2019s kind of arbitrary.\n\nDR. EZEKIEL EMANUEL: I say that, yes.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: And you talk about something you call the American immortal. Who is this being?\n\nDR. EZEKIEL EMANUEL: My brother. The American immortal are people who want to put off death as long as possible, want to live as long as possible, get every day out of it. They take all these \u2014 they change their diet. They exercise like mad. They take protein concoctions and all sorts of other supplements.\n\nAnd it\u2019s almost a religion for them to live as long as possible. And I think they \u2014 in their mind, they will be as vital as they are when they\u2019re, say, 50 all the way to the end. But, of course, we all do deteriorate, we all do slow down, we all do get disabilities.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: You looked at a lot of research for what you have written, and you talk about how, as you age, you really don\u2019t get healthy. No matter how hard you try, a lot of things creep up on you.\n\nDR. EZEKIEL EMANUEL: Yes, so there\u2019s a theory which was developed in the early 1980s at Stanford, of course, that there will be a compression of morbidity.\n\nSo, as we age, as we get older, we are actually going to become healthier, that the falling apart, the disabilities, the dementia, they\u2019re going to become ever smaller parts of life. And that was a very, very compelling theory, and a lot of people grabbed on to it.\n\nTurns out that\u2019s not true. The data are that, as we age, we have actually added more years of disability, so there\u2019s not a compression of morbidity. There\u2019s actually been an expansion, and that I think is \u2014 it\u2019s somewhat distracting for people to realize, yes, we will live longer, but we will also live with more functional limitations, less able to move around, more mental limitations, more psychological depression, and other mental problems.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: You put \u2014 you\u2019re pretty critical in this piece, Zeke Emanuel, of slowing down, of living a quieter life, of spending time smelling the roses.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: You talk about riding a bicycle and making poetry as if it\u2019s just, you know, a throwaway. What\u2019s wrong with having that quiet phase of life after a certain point?\n\nDR. EZEKIEL EMANUEL: I do \u2014 I mean, that is part of my view, that, you know, we\u2019re on the earth for a very short period of time, no matter what we do. Even if we\u2019re an American immortal, it\u2019s not going to be for centuries.\n\nAnd we have to get the best out of it and also get the most out of our life. It\u2019s a privilege, obviously, slowing down and being a little sort of self-indulgent. I don\u2019t find that as meaningful to me. And I find it a little sort of focused on me, instead of focused on what I can contribute and what I can do for bettering the world and bettering, you know, my family and my community.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: So, you\u2019re kind of saying unless you\u2019re contributing actively every minute of every day, practically, then really there\u2019s not much point in living?\n\nDR. EZEKIEL EMANUEL: Well, first of all, that\u2019s my personal philosophy. And I do believe that contributing can happen in a number of different ways.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: You know there\u2019s a lot of pushback from people who point to all the people we know of who are very contributing well beyond 75.\n\nI just look \u2014 you look at anywhere you turn. I mean, in the world of entertainment, it\u2019s so easy, the Jack Nicholsons, the Willie Nelsons, the Sidney Poitiers. I mean, Betty White is 91, I.M. Pei. Queen Elizabeth is 88. Jimmy Carter just turned 90.\n\nDR. EZEKIEL EMANUEL: So, that\u2019s almost everyone\u2019s first reaction is to begin listing lots and lots of people who are over 75 and still creative, productive and engaged. And of course there are going to be people.\n\nIt\u2019s a bell-shaped curve and it\u2019s some-shaped curve, there are going to be outliers, people over 75. But let\u2019s remember we live in a country of 300 million people. In the developed world, Western world, there may be a billion people. Giving me a list of 20, 30, even thousands of people who are creative after 75, you have to understand those are very select outliers.\n\nThey are not the common thing. And I believe that we shouldn\u2019t \u2014 we can\u2019t live our life as if we\u2019re going to be a very rare outlier. Odds are, you won\u2019t be an outlier, and I tend to go with the odds. I\u2019m a sort of \u2014 I live life by, you know, what does the data show? And that\u2019s most likely to happen.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: What does your family think about this? You have how many daughters?\n\nDR. EZEKIEL EMANUEL: I have three daughters.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: Three daughters. Don\u2019t you want to see your grandchildren grow up?\n\nDR. EZEKIEL EMANUEL: Absolutely. And I want\u2026\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: But you have put kind of a limit on it, haven\u2019t you?\n\nDR. EZEKIEL EMANUEL: Well, I am very, very committed to seeing my grandchildren.\n\nAnd what I really, really care about is how they remember me. And I want them to remember me vital, doing crazy things with the kids on the swings and the slides and the playgrounds, maybe taking them on trips and, you know, kayaking around the Everglades or in Alaska. I don\u2019t want them to remember me as frail or demented or repeating myself. I would think that would actually be a tragedy.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: But isn\u2019t there something, some value in the \u2014 just being there for family, whether you\u2019re 75, 85, 95, and your family is around you, and isn\u2019t there some personal value\u2026\n\nDR. EZEKIEL EMANUEL: Connection?\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: Connection.\n\nDR. EZEKIEL EMANUEL: Look, I think there is a very important connection, and \u2014 but I think if you\u2019re just confined to a chair or you\u2019re demented or you\u2019re sort of just very slow, it may not be as meaningful as we try to project.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: One last thing. You said you have heard from doctors, medical professionals. You have heard from a lot of people who are very critical of what you have written. What are doctors saying?\n\nDR. EZEKIEL EMANUEL: Well, I have heard from hundreds, if not thousands of people now. One category is people who violently disagree with me and think I\u2019m crazy, one category of people who do agree with me and think I have got it exactly right.\n\nAnd that, about half of those people are in the health professions. They\u2019re doctors, they\u2019re nurses, they work at health insurance companies, they work at home health care agencies. And they almost uniformly \u2014 I have been racking my brain to think of one who\u2019s a health professional who doesn\u2019t agree with me. They almost uniformly say, yes, you\u2019re absolutely right.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: And, by the way, you also say in this piece at the end you reserve the right to change your mind.\n\nDR. EZEKIEL EMANUEL: Look, by 75, it really is a complete life. You will have grown up. You will have picked a career, worked hard in the career, had kids, raised them, had grandchildren. What more could you ask? That\u2019s a very rich, rich life.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: But it\u2019s a number that could change, right? In 100 years, it could be 85 or 95.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nDR. EZEKIEL EMANUEL: I know there are many people who think that will be true.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: Well, we\u2019re going to continue this conversation online.\n\nBut, for right now, Dr. Zeke Emanuel, thank you.\n\nDR.
