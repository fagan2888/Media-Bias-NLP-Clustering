Scott Applewhite\n\nHouse Republicans are holding a hearing on Wednesday over whether to sue President Obama for unilaterally delaying the employer responsibility provision in the Affordable Care Act in an effort to challenge what they see as his administration\u2019s lawless use of executive authority. The lawsuit will come after the administration twice delayed the provision \u2014 which requires employers with more than 50 employees to pay a fine if they don\u2019t offer affordable quality coverage \u2014 citing complaints from firms that claimed they wouldn\u2019t be ready to meet its requirement by 2014.\n\nAnd while the lawsuit may be \u201cuniting House and Senate Republicans\u201d and filling up the GOP\u2019s campaign coffers, it is unlikely to bear fruit for House Republicans in court. Here are 5 reasons why:\n\n1. The GOP may not have standing to file suit. A plaintiff who files a lawsuit must have been injured in some way by the person that they are suing. But neither House Speaker John Boehner (R-OH) nor any other member of Congress has been injured by the delay.\n\n2 Conservative legal scholars have dismissed the suit. Ironically, the GOP\u2019s own star witness in favor of the lawsuit , Elizabeth Price Foley, a law professor at Florida International University, once argued that its success is unlikely. \u201cWhen a president delays or exempts people from a law \u2014 so-called benevolent suspensions \u2014 who has standing to sue him?\u201d she wrote in the Daily Caller. \u201cGenerally, no one. Benevolent suspensions of law don\u2019t, by definition, create a sufficiently concrete injury for standing. That\u2019s why, when President Obama delayed various provisions of Obamacare \u2014 the employer mandate, the annual out-of-pocket caps, the prohibition on the sale of \u2018substandard\u2019 policies \u2014 his actions cannot be challenged in court.\u201d\n\nHarvard law professor Jack Goldsmith predicted, \u201cThe lawsuit will almost certainly fail, and should fail, for lack of congressional standing. \u201cFormer Bush Department of Justice prosecutor Andrew McCarthy has also described the suit as \u201ceither untrue or abject nonsense.\u201d\n\n3. The lawsuit would implement Obamacare sooner. Obama initially postponed the employer responsibility provision until 2015 in July of 2103, arguing that the Treasury Department has \u201ctransition relief\u201d authority to delay provisions of new law. In February of this year, the administration announced that companies with 50 to 99 employees will have until 2016 to extend insurance to their employees, while larger businesses with 100 or more workers can avoid paying a fine if they offer health care to at least 70 percent of their workers next year, and cover 95 percent of their workers in 2016.\n\nBut should Republicans win their lawsuit, the provision would be implemented sooner \u2014 over the objections of businesses and the GOP itself, which has repeatedly voted to repeal the law. It is also unlikely that the Supreme Court would reach a final decision on his case until June 2016, months after the employer mandate is supposed to go into effect anyway.\n\n4. When the delay was first announced GOP didn\u2019t think it was illegal. Republicans did not immediately question the legality of the postponement. Instead, the GOP called on Obama to also delay the individual mandate and vowed to take another vote on the matter.\n\n\u201cIs it fair for the president of the United States to give American businesses an exemption from his health care law\u2019s mandate without giving the same exemption to the rest of America? Hell no, it\u2019s not fair,\u201d Boehner told House Republicans. \u201cWe should be thinking about giving the rest of America the same exemption that Obama last week gave businesses.\u201d In a letter to Obama, Boehner even admitted that the employer mandate \u201ccannot be implemented within the current time frame.\u201d The party has referred to the provision as a \u201cjobs killer\u201d and has sought its repeal.\n\n5. Most Americans oppose the effort. A survey released on Monday by Americans United for Change found that 51 percent of voters don\u2019t believe the lawsuit is legitimate and 56 percent believe it to be wasteful.\n\nEven some conservatives have rejected the effort. RedState.com editor-in-chief Erick Erickson, has called the lawsuit \u201ca political stunt wasting taxpayer dollars\u201d that is \u201cdesigned to incite Republican voters who might otherwise stay home.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "Why would Republicans want to implement Obamacare sooner?", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "Why would Republicans want to implement Obamacare sooner?", "title": "5 Reasons Why John Boehner\u2019s Anti-Obama Lawsuit Is A Terrible Idea", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/justice/2014/07/16/3460802/5-reasons-the-gops-obamacare-lawsuit-is-the-worst-idea-ever/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/AP745020596703-3-e1392652580893.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Why would Republicans want to implement Obamacare sooner?", "title": "5 Reasons Why John Boehner\u2019s Anti-Obama Lawsuit Is A Terrible Idea", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/AP745020596703-3-e1392652580893-321x214.jpg", "creator": "@@igorvolsky", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-justice", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/AP745020596703-3-e1392652580893.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/AP745020596703-3-e1392652580893.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2014-07-16T13:01:47+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/ivolsky"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd02eb\"", "article_summary": "Justice 5 Reasons Why John Boehner\u2019s Anti-Obama Lawsuit Is A Terrible Idea CREDIT: AP Photo/J.\nAnd while the lawsuit may be \u201cuniting House and Senate Republicans\u201d and filling up the GOP\u2019s campaign coffers, it is unlikely to bear fruit for House Republicans in court.\nHell no, it\u2019s not fair,\u201d Boehner told House Republicans.\nIt is also unlikely that the Supreme Court would reach a final decision on his case until June 2016, months after the employer mandate is supposed to go into effect anyway.\nA plaintiff who files a lawsuit must have been injured in some way by the person that they are suing."}
