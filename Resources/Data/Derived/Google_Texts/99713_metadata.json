Rick Scott bragged that Florida\u2019s education system is getting record funding on his watch.\n\nDuring a news conference on Oct. 14, 2015 , Scott called for tax cuts beyond the $400 million the Legislature approved earlier in the year. Scott had promised to cut taxes by $1 billion over two years, but lawmakers are already signaling that may not be possible .\n\nWhen a reporter asked Scott how he can push tax cuts and still guarantee public schools the capital funding they need, Scott repeated a boast he\u2019s made before: \"We have the highest funding in (the) K-12 system in the history of the state.\"\n\nScott and Florida Republicans have been making the claim since his 2014 re-election campaign that school funding has been at historic levels, but it\u2019s simply not a complete picture of the education budget. (Scott intends to release his full budget proposal in December.) We decided it was time to revisit this particular claim.\n\nTotal vs. per-pupil vs. inflation\n\nThe education budget has been a prickly issue for Scott since he recommended major cuts in his first year in office. State tax revenues have recovered with the end of the recession, and Scott has pushed to move the budget back up each year since, which has led to his current claim.\n\nWhile Scott and former Gov. Charlie Crist squabbled during the 2014 gubernatorial campaign over who held the spending record, we noted they both could stake a claim : Scott had the largest budget in total dollars, while Crist spent the most per student back in 2007-08.\n\nWith Scott well into his second term, the same is still true today.\n\nAfter winning re-election, Scott wanted to bump up spending in his January 2015 budget proposal , to $19.75 billion total and $7,176 per pupil. That would have been about $850,000 higher than the previous year\u2019s budget, and $50 higher per student than the record of $7,126 under Crist.\n\nBut the Legislature has the final say, and faced a budget deadlock over several issues , including a debate about potentially expanding Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. After a special session in the summer to hammer out a budget, the Legislature didn\u2019t give Scott the amount he wanted .\n\nWe checked the latest calculations for the Florida Education Finance Program , a pot of state and local money for schools that is adjusted periodically throughout the year to factor in tax receipts and enrollment. We found that for the 2015-16 school year , the K-12 system is getting a total budget of about $19.7 billion, or about $7,105 per student .\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at the past few years to get a better idea of how much money has been going to education spending.\n\nFiscal year (governor) Total K-12 budget Per pupil spending K-12 enrollment 2007-08 (Crist) $18.7 billion $7,126 2.63 million 2008-09 (Crist) $17.9 billion $6,846 2.62 million 2009-10 (Crist)* $18 billion $6,846 2.63 million 2010-11 (Crist)* $18.2 billion $6,897 2.64 million 2011-12 (Scott) $16.6 billion $6,217 2.67 million 2012-13 (Scott) $17.2 billion $6,376 2.70 million 2013-14 (Scott) $18.3 billion $6,769 2.705 million 2014-15 (Scott) $18.9 billion $6,915 2.74 million 2015-16 (Scott) $19.7 billion $7,105 2.77 million\n\n*Includes federal stimulus money\n\nThere are some details about the funding that we won\u2019t explore in much detail. The two years marked with an asterisk were years when Florida used about $900 million each in federal stimulus money for the budget, for example. Also, the amount of property taxes collected through what is known as the Required Local Effort can change from year to year.\n\nScott's office said the budget is at its highest level ever in terms of total dollars. But you would expect it to be, considering the K-12 school system also has its highest enrollment ever. There are about 100,000 more students today than when Scott took office, and about 140,000 more than when Crist oversaw the highest per-pupil spending in 2007-08.\n\nThe money in today\u2019s budget isn\u2019t exceeding the record level in terms of sheer dollars per student, but that\u2019s even less so when we factor for inflation.\n\nAccording to the Bureau of Labor Statistics Consumer Price Index inflation calculator , which is somewhat imprecise but can give us broad insight on the subject, even Scott\u2019s January 2015 request to best Crist\u2019s spending by $50 per student lags far behind. Just to match 2007\u2019s $7,126, per-pupil spending would have to be in the neighborhood of $8,190 today. Using this method, the current total budget would have to be in excess of $21.4 billion.\n\nWe\u2019ve rated claims similar to this one Half True in the past , but it\u2019s apparent that Scott\u2019s claim is misleading. Any reasonable person would expect a growing education system to naturally have a larger budget after nearly a decade. In this case, the dollars simply don\u2019t go as far as they once did.\n\nOur ruling\n\nScott said, \"We have the highest funding in (the) K-12 system in the history of the state.\"\n\nThat\u2019s accurate in one sense, because the state\u2019s total education budget is at an all-time high of $19.7 billion. But enrollment is also higher than in years past. Per-pupil spending is still below historic dollar totals and remains far below equitable levels when adjusted for inflation.\n\nEducation spending has essentially stood still over the last nine years. Scott\u2019s claim obscures that.\n\nThe statement contains an element of truth, but ignores critical facts. We rate it Mostly False.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Amid his calls for legislators to cut taxes by hundreds of millions of dollars next year, Gov.
