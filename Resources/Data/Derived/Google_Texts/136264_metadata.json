But among the scores of mourners who memorialized George T. \u201cJoe\u201d Sakato on Saturday afternoon, everyone called him a hero.\n\nSakato, who received the Congressional Medal of Honor for his daring actions in France during World War II that helped rescue a surrounded American unit, died Dec. 2 at 94. Following his interment earlier in the day at Fairmont Cemetery, he was recalled by family and friends, veterans \u2014 including four other Medal of Honor recipients \u2014 and current military members as a man defined by much more than his bravery on the battlefield.\n\nBut his military service, at a time when Japanese-Americans were forced into internment camps, shaped his legacy.\n\n\u201cI learned humility from a man who, for a few minutes in October of 1944, was the most heroic person on the planet,\u201d said Rick Crandall, a longtime friend who helped organize the memorial at the Heritage Christian Center in Aurora. \u201cI learned true patriotism from someone who watched his mother and father lose their life possessions and be forced to live on a farm in Arizona because they looked different.\n\n\u201cHe could\u2019ve been angry for the rest of his life, and with good reason. Instead, he used that anger to become an example of what a real American looks like.\u201d\n\nA succession of speakers also remembered Sakato as open-hearted, compassionate and entertaining \u2014 a caring and nurturing man who reveled in the contagious joy and exuberance of kids. They told stories of how he loved to dance, loved his family and how he loved the Denver Broncos so dearly that he always wore a pair of boxers with the team insignia on game days.\n\nBut his notoriety grew from his heroism with the 442nd Regimental Combat Team, a segregated unit of Japanese-American soldiers that during the war became highly decorated. He sometimes explained that he fought two battles \u2014 one against the Nazis and another against discrimination in his own country.\n\nSakato, having just watched a fellow soldier die in his arms as they fought to take a key hill, went on a rampage against the enemy \u2014 he later labeled his state of mind \u201croad rage.\u201d\n\nHe launched an assault in which he killed 12, personally captured four and assisted his platoon in taking another 34 prisoners. The actions helped save the unit known as \u201cThe Lost Battalion\u201d that had been isolated behind enemy lines.\n\nAfterward, Sakato was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross. But decades later, review of military records upgraded the recognition, and President Bill Clinton presented him the Medal of Honor in 2000.\n\n\u201cJoe was not an ordinary Joe,\u201d said Lawson Sakai, a fellow veteran of the 442nd, \u201cbut a true American hero. Wherever you are, Joe, rest in peace.\u201d\n\nSakato\u2019s niece, Seleste Sakato, recounted that while his family intended to name him Joe, they mistakenly spelled the name \u201cGeo.\u201d And so officially, he became George.\n\n\u201cBut family has always known him as Uncle Joe,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen we realized his real name was George we said, \u2018What? Who\u2019s that?\u2019 \u201c\n\nThree ukulele groups joined to lead the congregation in the 442nd\u2019s fight song, \u201cGo For Broke.\u201d And toward the event\u2019s conclusion, everyone honored Sakato\u2019s insistence that when he was remembered at the memorial, they sing \u201cTaps\u201d \u2014 more commonly heard as a bugle refrain.\n\nTogether, the crowd rose and honored a life well-lived.\n\n\u201cThat life does not and should not end today,\u201d Crandall said. \u201cIt is on us to be witness that such a remarkable man lived.\u201d\n\nKevin Simpson: 303-954-1739, ksimpson@denverpost.com or @ksimpsondp", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Mourners honor George \u201cJoe\u201d Sakato for wartime heroism and much more", "title": "Mourners honor George \u201cJoe\u201d Sakato for wartime heroism and much more", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/01/16/mourners-honor-george-joe-sakato-for-wartime-heroism-and-much-more/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160116__BN20160115_Z00_BNCD17SAKATO1p2.jpg", "height": 463}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160116__BN20160115_Z00_BNCD17SAKATO1p2.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2016-01-16T19:02:23+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-19T00:00:39+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "But among the scores of mourners who memorialized George T. \u201cJoe\u201d Sakato on Saturday afternoon, everyone called him a hero.\n\u201cJoe was not an ordinary Joe,\u201d said Lawson Sakai, a fellow veteran of the 442nd, \u201cbut a true American hero.\nBut decades later, review of military records upgraded the recognition, and President Bill Clinton presented him the Medal of Honor in 2000.\nSakato, who received the Congressional Medal of Honor for his daring actions in France during World War II that helped rescue a surrounded American unit, died Dec. 2 at 94.\nWherever you are, Joe, rest in peace.\u201dSakato\u2019s niece, Seleste Sakato, recounted that while his family intended to name him Joe, they mistakenly spelled the name \u201cGeo.\u201d And so officially, he became George."}
