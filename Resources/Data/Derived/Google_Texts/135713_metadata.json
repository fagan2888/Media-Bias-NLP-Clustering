After the Terrapins got a touchdown pass from Caleb Rowe, a 45-yard touchdown run by McDowell gave Clemson a 40-20 lead with 5:03 to go.\n\nEarlier in the game, Maryland forced the Tigers (7-1, 4-1) to kick field goals after they reached the red zone. The trend didn\u2019t continue in the fourth quarter, and the Terrapins lost for the third time in four games.\n\n\u201cWe gave up a couple plays there late,\u201d coach Randy Edsall said. \u201cWhat we were going to have to do is just try to hold on and not let them score the touchdown late and kick field goals, but we weren\u2019t able to do that in the fourth quarter.\u201d\n\nMaryland played without several key injured starters, including quarterback C.J. Brown, running back Brandon Ross, wide receivers Stefon Diggs and Deon Long, and tight end Dave Stinebaugh.\n\nRowe went 19 for 45 for yards and three touchdowns, and Levern Jacobs had eight catches for 158 yards. But the Terrapins went 48 minutes between their first and second touchdowns and committed four turnovers.\n\n\u201cI feel like I did OK,\u201d Rowe said. \u201cOf course, I left plays out on the field, everyone did. But it just wasn\u2019t good enough in the end.\u201d\n\nStill, it was an impressive showing against one of the finest teams in the country.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re proving that we are developing depth here in our program and that the guys know that we as coaches believe in them, that if they\u2019re on the field we feel as though they\u2019re going to be able to get the job done. You kind of just preach that,\u201d Edsall said.\n\nBoyd threw for a touchdown and ran for a score, Sammy Watkins had a school-record 14 catches for 163 yards and McDowell rushed for 161 yards and two touchdowns to help the Tigers rebound from last week\u2019s 51-14 defeat against Florida State.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s good to get the win, get back on track,\u201d coach Dabo Sweeny said. \u201cWe had a great week, we really did. I thought our guys bounced back. If there was a hangover, if we weren\u2019t focused, this team could have gone south in a hurry. But it didn\u2019t. It responded. That\u2019s what great teams do.\u201d\n\nIt was the seventh straight road win for the Tigers, their longest streak since a nine-game run in 1978-79.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re going to be a great program, you\u2019ve got to win consistently on the road,\u201d Sweeny said. \u201cI\u2019m just really proud of our guys for coming up here and taking care of business.\u201d\n\nTrailing 16-7 at halftime, Maryland converted fumbles by Watkins and McDowell into field goals to close to 16-13 with four minutes elapsed in the third quarter.\n\nSweeny said that might have been the turning point.\n\n\u201cHats off to our defense,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you put the ball down twice inside your own 20 and they only come away with six points, our defense responded.\u201d\n\nBoyd answered with a 68-yard drive before Catanzaro connected on a 24-yarder.\n\nDespite making only three first downs in the third quarter, Maryland remained within striking distance until running back Albert Reid lost a fumble at the Maryland 31 and Clemson\u2019s Spencer Shuey took it to the 22. Four plays later, Boyd scored to make 26-13 with 13:04 left.\n\nThat gave Boyd 112 touchdowns via run or pass, tied with Phillip Rivers for most in ACC history.\n\nWatkins had 10 catches for 127 yards by halftime, and Clemson ran more than twice as many offensive plays as the Terrapins in building a nine-point cushion at intermission.\n\nDown 3-0, the Terrapins got a big play from Jacobs in his first start of the year. Jacobs grabbed a short pass over the middle and sprinted into the end zone for a 71-yard touchdown.\n\nDenied after getting a first down at the Maryland 2, the Tigers settled for a field goal to make it 7-6.\n\nThen, after Jayron Kearse picked off a Rowe pass in the end zone, Clemson put together a 13-play march that ended with another field goal.\n\nThe Tigers finally got their first touchdown with nine seconds left in the half. After a 30-yard completion to Watkins, Boyd threw a 5-yard scoring pass to Jordan Leggett.\n\n\u201cI never thought that we were going to lose that game,\u201d Maryland defensive back Sean Davis said. \u201cEven when we were down at halftime, I always thought that, and the whole team thought that.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "With standout quarterback Tajh Boyd leading the way, Clemson scored three touchdowns in the final 15 minutes and pulled away to a 40-27 victory Saturday.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "With standout quarterback Tajh Boyd leading the way, Clemson scored three touchdowns in the final 15 minutes and pulled away to a 40-27 victory Saturday.", "title": "Shorthanded Terps fall apart late in loss to No. 9 Clemson", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/oct/26/shorthanded-terps-fall-apart-late-loss-no-9-clemso/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2013/10/26/clemson-maryland-footballjpeg-0b1ba.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2013/10/26/clemson-maryland-footballjpeg-0b1ba.jpg", "description": "With standout quarterback Tajh Boyd leading the way, Clemson scored three touchdowns in the final 15 minutes and pulled away to a 40-27 victory Saturday.", "card": "summary", "title": "Shorthanded Terps fall apart late in loss to No. 9 Clemson"}, "Author": "David Ginsburg", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Sports, Tajh Boyd, Clemson, Caleb Rowe, Roderick Mcdowell"}, "article_summary": "After the Terrapins got a touchdown pass from Caleb Rowe, a 45-yard touchdown run by McDowell gave Clemson a 40-20 lead with 5:03 to go.\nEarlier in the game, Maryland forced the Tigers (7-1, 4-1) to kick field goals after they reached the red zone.\nThat gave Boyd 112 touchdowns via run or pass, tied with Phillip Rivers for most in ACC history.\nRowe went 19 for 45 for yards and three touchdowns, and Levern Jacobs had eight catches for 158 yards.\nDenied after getting a first down at the Maryland 2, the Tigers settled for a field goal to make it 7-6."}
