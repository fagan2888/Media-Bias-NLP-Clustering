A New Jersey man is facing more charges for allegedly committing lewd acts in public bathrooms.

The Monmouth County Prosecutor's Office said more victims came forward after 49-year-old Gregory Rittman was arrested in late October.

In that case, an 8-year-old reported witnessing Rittman masturbate in a McDonald's restroom, according to prosecutors.

Prosecutors said this week that three additional victims, who are between the ages of 6 and 8, have since reported similar incidents that occurred over the past year.

Authorities say they believe Rittman has committed lewd acts in front of children in public restrooms in Monmouth and Ocean counties for about two years, and additional cases have yet to be reported.

Rittman, of Howell, now faces 12 additional counts, prosecutors said. Charges include second-degree sexual assault, third-degree endangering the welfare of a child, fourth-degree lewdness and harassment.

Anyone with information about any other incidents is asked to call police at 732-449-4500, Ext. 1162, or prosecutors at 732-431-7160.
