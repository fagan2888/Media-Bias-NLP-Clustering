The small business mandate has been postponed for a year, as has the online function of the Small Business Health Insurance Option Program, but small businesses can still file paper applications to enroll their 50 or under workforces.\n\n\n\nA quick place to start online is at Enroll Michigan. There is additional information at Enroll America. Small businesses and individuals can find navigators and certified application counselors to help guide them through the enrollment process.\n\nOn Monday, Oakwood Healthcare is co-sponsoring two community education forums at Oakwood Hospital & Medical Center in Dearborn. The other co-sponsors are ACCESS Community Health and Research Center, Dearborn, Enroll America and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. The first session, called Understanding the Health Insurance Marketplace, is scheduled for 2-3 p.m. and the second is 6-7 p.m.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really about education, not just enrollment,\u201d Adnan Hammad, director of ACCESS, said in a statement. \u201cOur community at large lacks information, lacks knowledge of what the Affordable Care Act is all about.\u201d\n\n\n\nComputer glitches derailed and slowed enrollment on healthcare.gov, the website that Michigan residents use to search for 43 different health insurance plans, for most of October and November. But more than 125,000 people so far have signed up for health insurance on healthcare.gov with more than 150,000 on the 14 state exchanges. The federal government projected more than 7 million will sign up for private health insurance or Medicaid by March 31.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe understand that there are a lot of questions about this process,\u201d Mary Zatina, Oakwood\u2019s senior vice president of government relations and corporate communications, said in a statement.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe want to make ourselves available, like we always have, as a resource where the community can get those answers. Improving access to quality health care is what we are all about.\u201d Oakwood has also dedicated a Web page to the Affordable Care Act: oakwood.org/affordable-care-act. The page includes a subsidy calculator consumers can use to determine how much financial assistance they can garner from the federal government.\n\nSmall business resources\n\nFollowing are some resources to help small businesses enroll in Obamacare in Southeast Michigan.
