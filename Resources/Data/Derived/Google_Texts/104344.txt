Sioux Falls, SD

A growing number of people are turning to apps and websites to reach their fitness goals.

In 2015, around two thousand South Dakotans will start a new wellness plan online.

Working out with a partner is a good way to hold yourself accountable to your New Year's resolutions, but Lori Fiedler...

"Try to get healthier," Fiedler said.

...is finding accountability a different way. She tracks and shares her workouts with co-workers through FitCare.

"We can do public blogs, so you can talk back and forth. You can put recipes out there," Fiedler said.

FitCare is a new online program for DAKOTACARE clients. You can keep your goals personal or share them with a group.

"If you're doing a specific challenge or training for a particular race, you can post different tips," DAKOTACARE Director of Health and Wellness Trisha Dohn said.

It also synchs up with wearable activity-tracking devices, like the Fitbit wristband.

"I can also use my cell phone if I don't have my Fitbit. I can text in my activity and my steps through my cell phone," Fiedler said.

"They can text their exercise. They can scan their different foods to find out nutrition facts from their phone," Dohn said.

DAKOTACARE Director of Health and Wellness Trisha Dohn believes online programs and apps will become increasingly popular for people looking to lose weight or eat healthier.

"It allows them to stay engaged no matter where they're at," Dohn said.

Which Fiedler hopes will help to keep her New Year's resolution to eat healthier and exercise more.

"Like everyone else I've made New Year's resolutions that lasted only a couple months. Hopefully this year will be a little bit different," Fiedler said.

If you're interested in the online wellness program, you can learn more by contacting DAKOTACARE Health and Wellness.
