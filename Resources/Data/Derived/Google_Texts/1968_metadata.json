That\u2019s because there\u2019s a factor none of us considered until very recently: It\u2019s not guns that kill people, it\u2019s dogs with guns that kill people. But, you know, they probably wouldn\u2019t have if we had gun control or people at least kept their guns securely locked away where an animal that eats its own poop on a regular basis couldn\u2019t get to them. Because if dogs can operate a gun, America, we\u2019ve got a serious problem.\n\nThe Washington Post reports that at least six humans have been shot by a canine in the past year. And that\u2019s just an estimate because some people probably didn\u2019t report their dog-related gunshot injuries. And while the gunshots are rarely fatal (the last death occurred in 2008, but again, there might be some unreported fatalities), the whole thing where dogs can even get near enough to guns to trigger them? That\u2019s a problem.\n\nOf course, many of the accidents happen in Florida:\n\nThe dog who shot his owner in the leg with a .380 pistol while riding in his truck in 2013\n\nThe dog who jumped onto a bed and knocked another .380 pistol on the ground in 2010, shooting its \u201cextremely intoxicated\u201d owner in the hand\n\nThe three-month-old shepherd mix puppy who shot a man in the wrist with a revolver in 2004 while the man was trying to shoot the puppy and its siblings \u201cbecause he couldn\u2019t find them a home.\u201d\n\nWhile the subject may appear to be funny at first, it really is a major issue, and a reminder that any animal (and that includes small, adorable children) is capable of triggering a firearm. And then there\u2019s the matter of dogs being on the other side of gun violence:\n\nWhen people, dogs and guns mix, the dogs are usually at the receiving end of the gunfire. Police shootings of dogs, sometimes under questionable circumstances, seem to happen with disturbing frequency. Some police departments have found that dog shootings can be drastically cut simply giving their officers the right training on how to deal with canines.\n\nCats, surprisingly are not shooting people at a rate anywhere near as alarming. The last reported incident, according to The Post, dates back to 2005. But that could be because cats are just better at finishing the job and leaving no evidence.\n\nNo real idea if dogs are killing people at the same clip as Obamacare, but since no one\u2019s got any real statistics on that, either, I\u2019m just going to assume that it\u2019s true.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Finally, a real argument for gun control", "generator": "WordPress.com", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1109605093", "parsely-page": "{\"title\":\"Dogs With Guns Kill More People Than Obamacare (Probably)\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/uproxx.com\\/news\\/dogs-with-guns-kill-more-people-than-obamacare-probably\\/\",\"image_url\":\"https:\\/\\/uproxx.files.wordpress.com\\/2015\\/10\\/dog-with-gun.jpg?quality=90&w=650\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":\"UP-1201150\",\"pub_date\":\"2015-10-29T00:39:17Z\",\"author\":\"Mark Shrayber\",\"section\":\"NEWS\"}", "twitter": {"widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "site": "@UPROXX", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@UPROXX"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "News and Culture for the Digital Generation", "parsely-metadata": "{\"type\": \"story\"}", "robots": "index,follow", "og": {"site_name": "UPROXX", "description": "Finally, a real argument for gun control", "title": "Dogs With Guns Kill More People Than Obamacare (Probably)", "url": "http://uproxx.com/news/dogs-with-guns-kill-more-people-than-obamacare-probably/", "image": {"width": 650, "identifier": "https://uproxx.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/dog-with-gun.jpg?quality=90&w=650", "height": 398}, "locale": "en_GB", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": "680207693,2208604", "page_id": 116548701336, "app_id": 117400151618132}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "application-name": "UPROXX", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UPROXX", "published_time": "2015-10-29T00:39:17+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-10-29T00:43:27+00:00"}, "keywords": "media, news, webculture,", "google-site-verification": "370ZQZwYhpp3OFLpudIZ11ONRN8X1ZhGglPMAFJ6GKw", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://uproxx.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/bae760df0e3bd64e122a0b36facaee58?s=16"}, "article_summary": "And then there\u2019s the matter of dogs being on the other side of gun violence:When people, dogs and guns mix, the dogs are usually at the receiving end of the gunfire.\nThat\u2019s because there\u2019s a factor none of us considered until very recently: It\u2019s not guns that kill people, it\u2019s dogs with guns that kill people.\nPolice shootings of dogs, sometimes under questionable circumstances, seem to happen with disturbing frequency.\nThe Washington Post reports that at least six humans have been shot by a canine in the past year.\nBecause if dogs can operate a gun, America, we\u2019ve got a serious problem."}
