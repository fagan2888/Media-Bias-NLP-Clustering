This intervention can help us break that cycle of despair.\u201d\n\nAmerican Indian adolescents have the highest rates of teen pregnancy, substance use, suicide, and dropping out of high school of any racial or ethnic group in the country, researchers noted.\n\nFor the study, 322 pregnant teens were randomly assigned to receive optimized standard care \u2014 transportation to prenatal and well-baby clinic visits, pamphlets about childcare, and other resources and referrals to local services \u2014 or optimized standard care plus a program of 63 in-home education sessions, known as Family Spirit.\n\nIn the Family Spirit intervention, visits occurred weekly through the last trimester of pregnancy, biweekly until four months after the baby\u2019s birth, monthly from months four through 12, and then bimonthly until the child turned three, the researchers explained.\n\nThe lessons covered everything from the benefits of breastfeeding and reading to your child to creating sleep and feeding schedules, as well as life skills such as budgeting, conflict resolution, and preventing substance use.\n\nBefore beginning the study, the researchers noted that the teens had high rates of substance use in their lifetime (more than 84 percent), depressive symptoms (more than 32 percent), high school dropout rates (more than 57 percent), and residential instability (51 percent moved more than twice in a year).\n\nThe researchers found that mothers in the Family Spirit group were less likely to use illegal drugs, be depressed, or experience behavior problems than those in the control group. They also found that the children in the Family Spirit group were less likely to show early behaviors known to signal future conduct problems, anxiety, and depression.\n\nThe children were easier to soothe, had better sleeping and eating patterns, and were more likely to meet emotional and behavioral milestones than those in the control group.\n\n\u201cWe found a consistent pattern of success across a number of different outcome measures,\u201d said the study\u2019s principal investigator, John Walkup, M.D., an adjunct professor at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and a faculty member at the Center for American Indian Health.\n\n\u201cThese early years are critical ones for children. We teach these mothers not only how to be competent parents, but how to cope with stressors and other risk factors that could impede positive parenting skills.\u201d\n\nA key to the program\u2019s success is utilizing local community health workers instead of more formally educated nurses, added Barlow.\n\n\u201cWe can grow the workforce in some of the poorest communities in the nation, where good jobs can be hard to come by,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cWith focused training, people with little formal education but important life experiences and a passion to serve their communities can become change agents to overcome these very tough problems.\u201d\n\nThe Affordable Care Act set aside $1.5 billion in funding for states to implement evidence-based home-visiting programs to support the health and development of at-risk children, with three percent earmarked for tribal communities.\n\nBarlow notes that Family Spirit was recently approved by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services as an evidence-based program, now eligible for the federal dollars.\n\nThe study, supported by a grant from the National Institutes of Health\u2019s National Institute on Drug Abuse, was published in the American Journal of Psychiatry.\n\nSource: Johns Hopkins University Bloomberg School of Public Health", "article_metadata": {"description": "New research has found that parenting and health education provided in the homes of pregnant American Indian teens reduced the girls' illegal drug use,", "og": {"site_name": "Psych Central News", "description": "New research has found that parenting and health education provided in the homes of pregnant American Indian teens reduced the girls' illegal drug use, depression, and behavior problems.
