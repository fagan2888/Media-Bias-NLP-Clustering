Timing the capitol bloviators:\n\nWatching the spate of committee hearings on Capitol Hill related to the Obamacare launch debacle reminds me of a story \u2014 or, rather, an ongoing type of coverage \u2014 that I wish the Washington Post, Politico or even C-Span would do: Keep count of the percentage of time each senator or congressman talks versus the amount of time the witnesses, whose appearances are ostensibly the purpose of the hearings, get to talk.\n\nA sub-tally might also be done of how much of the committee member\u2019s time is spent even asking a question, as opposed to giving a speech.\n\nAt most hearings each committee member is usually allotted five minutes to question the witness. My informal count of what I\u2019ve watched over the past few weeks had the members hogging three to four minutes each, sometimes more.\n\nThis would make a nice sidebar to any story about a hearing. And perhaps an award could be given out at the end of the year for the member of the Senate and the House who took up the most time. Who knows? Keeping a visible count like this might even turn the hearings into hearings.\n\n2. The French as the tough guys:\n\nI may have missed this because I don\u2019t follow foreign affairs as much as I should, but it would be great to read an explanation of how France \u2014 in fact, France run by a Socialist \u2014 has become the toughest member of the NATO alliance. Whether it\u2019s Mali, Syria and now the Iran nuclear negotiations, the country that former George W. Bush defense secretary Donald Rumsfeld dismissed as part of a timid \u201cold Europe\u201d now seems to want to be the West\u2019s leading hawk.\n\nHow did that happen?\n\n3. Has Wal-Mart gotten a bad rap?\n\nThe airwaves have been filled lately with ads touting \u201cthe real Wal-Mart\u201d as a company that is not only great for customers but great for its employees.\n\n\u201cHealth care starting at $40 a month,\u201d crows one Wal-Mart worker, referring to a fringe benefit he says he gets.\n\nAnother worker calls himself \u201cthe next American success story,\u201d because \u201cover 75 percent of store management started as hourly associates.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s opportunity here,\u201d he adds. \u201cI can use Wal-Mart\u2019s education benefits to get a degree.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about time Wal-Mart fielded a TV-advertising campaign that explains just why the stores are still so popular with Americans despite the disbelieving objections of elites that keep picking at the world\u2019s biggest retailer for one reason after another,\u201d wrote Dale Buss in a blog post on Forbes.com. \u201cBy focusing in a clear-eyed way\u2026on the strengths of the company and how they benefit various huge constituencies \u2014 American consumers, Wal-Mart workers, and Wal-Mart\u2019s supply-chain participants \u2014 the brand has a good shot at engendering more of the endemic kind of cultural goodwill that perpetually has escaped it.\u201d\n\nSo, someone obviously needs to fact check all these claims. And a special plea to editors: Give the story the same space if the claims are true as you would if they\u2019re not. News, after all, is best defined as telling people something they don\u2019t know. Given all the bad press Wal-Mart gets about how it treats employees, it would, indeed, be news if the positive claims check out.\n\n4. Brokaw on JFK coverage:\n\nAmid all the coverage of the 50th anniversary of the assassination of John F. Kennedy, this Op-Ed piece by Tom Brokaw last week in the Wall Street Journal might not have gotten the attention it deserves. Looking back at Kennedy\u2019s tenure, the former NBC News anchor wondered how the echo chamber of cable news and tweets, combined with today\u2019s take-no-prisoners political climate, might have affected the most tumultuous crises Kennedy faced. Here\u2019s an excerpt:\n\nWatching the recent government shutdown debate, I tried to imagine how Kennedy\u2019s Bay of Pigs disaster \u2014 the invasion of Cuba with a small surrogate army in April 1961 \u2014 might have played out in today\u2019s Benghazi climate. How long would it be before a national chorus of critics arose, demanding his impeachment? Can you imagine the wall-to-wall, channel-to-channel, blog-to-blog tsunami during the 12 days of the Cuban Missile Crisis in October 1962? That\u2019s when Kennedy had arguably his finest hour as commander in chief, cooling off potentially catastrophic war fever with imaginative diplomacy.\n\nBrokaw\u2019s whole piece is worth reading.\n\nPHOTO: Karen Gariel (C), 15, takes part in a protest for better wages outside Wal-mart in Los Angeles November 7, 2013.
