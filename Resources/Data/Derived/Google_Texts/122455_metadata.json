Nighttime lows will be in the single digits, including a 10-degree low predicted for New Year\u2019s Eve.\n\nThat, Fredin said, compares favorably to the 19 degrees below zero the Front Range experienced this week last year.\n\nThe best chance of breaking the freezing mark comes Monday, when temperatures flirt with the mid-30s, Fredin said. Sunday will be sunny and cold, with temperatures stuck in the 20s.\n\nHigh temps for Denver average 42 degrees this time of year, he said.\n\nFredin said the Front Range can expect the last five days of the year to be sunny to partly cloudy. A slight warming trend is expected as 2016 dawns on Friday.\n\nLight snow may come to the mountains on Tuesday and Wednesday.\n\nJohn Aguilar: 303-954-1695, jaguilar@denverpost.com or @abuvthefold", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Denver in a cold snap, but nothing for the record books", "title": "Denver in a cold snap, but nothing for the record books", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/12/27/denver-in-a-cold-snap-but-nothing-for-the-record-books/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151227__Denver_Weatherp1-1.jpg", "height": 441}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151227__Denver_Weatherp1-1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2015-12-27T10:50:15+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-19T19:41:00+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe277f\"", "article_summary": "While temperatures will struggle to break the freezing mark this week in Denver, no cold temperature extremes will likely be reached.\nThrough the end of the year, temperatures are expected to top out in the mid-20s to low-30s with little precipitation expected, Fredin said Sunday morning.\nThe best chance of breaking the freezing mark comes Monday, when temperatures flirt with the mid-30s, Fredin said.\n\u201cWe have to get in the minus teens to get in the record books,\u201d said Kyle Fredin, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Boulder.\nThat, Fredin said, compares favorably to the 19 degrees below zero the Front Range experienced this week last year."}
