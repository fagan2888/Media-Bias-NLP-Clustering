Close-up vision blurs, and cataracts lie ahead for many. Tear ducts function less well, and eyes can get dry and inflamed.\n\nWorse, glaucoma and macular degeneration can pose serious threats to vision, making reading difficult and jeopardizing independent living.\n\nBlindness is among the public\u2019s top health fears, according to the National Association for Eye and Vision Research \u2014 consistently up there with cancer and paralysis in polls of health concerns, according to the American Foundation for the Blind.\n\nAs baby boomers age, more people will be confronted with vision problems. Among Americans older than 40, there are an estimated 41 million cases of blindness, low vision or age-related eye disease, according to the patient advocacy organization Prevent Blindness, which predicts that this number will grow to 64 million by 2032.\n\nSo what can you do to keep your eyes working?\n\nWhile there\u2019s no way to prevent presbyopia \u2014 the fuzzy close-up vision that requires reading glasses \u2014 doctors say you can do a few things to lower your risk for \u2014 or at least slow the progression of \u2014 other age-related problems.\n\nCATARACTS HAPPEN\n\nBy the age of 80, more than half of all Americans have had cataracts, according to the American Academy of Ophthalmology. As time passes, the eye\u2019s lens becomes more opaque and dense, eventually causing blurry vision. This condition is called a cataract.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a normal part of the aging process, like getting gray hair,\u201d says Melanie Buttross, an ophthalmologist in Washington.\n\nAnd just as some people go gray early, some get cataracts early. Washington ophthalmologistDaniel Pluznik says he has \u201ca fair number of patients in their 40s\u201d with cataracts.\n\n\u201cThe more nearsighted you are, the younger you tend to develop them,\u201d he explains. The risk doesn\u2019t appear to run in families.\n\nAt first the blur can be counteracted with changes in prescription, but if it interferes with daily activities, doctors may recommend surgery \u2014 a generally safe, extremely common procedure that often takes less than a half-hour. Medical insurance usually covers it.\n\nThe surgeon removes the cataract, then inserts a clear artificial lens. The lens can be customized to correct vision. Afterward, many patients see better than they have in years.\n\n\u201cI have such good vision now,\u201d says Christine Lynn, 74, a psychotherapist who had been seriously myopic since childhood. After she started to have trouble driving at night, she had cataract surgery in each eye, about two weeks apart.\n\nThat was about two months ago. Lynn says her post-surgical sight is such a dramatic improvement that it\u2019s actually a little jarring.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never seen my face without glasses,\u201d she says. \u201cNow I see every pore. It\u2019s crazy.\u201d\n\nTREATING GLAUCOMA\n\nWould that there were such a happy-ending fix for glaucoma, a condition involving damage to the optic nerve, whose early stages can be detected only through an eye exam. It is diagnosed by evaluating the optic nerve and measuring the pressure of the fluid in the eye; high pressure can harm the optic nerve.\n\nPrevent Blindness estimates that more than 2.7 million Americans age 40 and older have glaucoma. Most at risk are African-Americans, Mexican-Americans, smokers, diabetics and people who are severely nearsighted or have a family history of glaucoma.\n\nThere is no way to prevent glaucoma \u2014 or to restore the vision loss it causes \u2014 but its progression can be halted with early intervention. That requires regular eye exams.\n\nThe American Academy of Ophthalmology recommends that adults without the risk factors mentioned above have a baseline exam at age 40, then evaluations every two to four years until 55. From that point on, they should be checked every one to three years, and one to two years once they\u2019re 65. Those at risk for glaucoma and other eye diseases should be seen more frequently.\n\nIgnore the guidelines at your peril.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, about once a year I have a patient who walks in the door and has lost significant vision, and has no idea he or she has glaucoma,\u201d Pluznik says. Since it\u2019s irreversible, he adds, \u201cthe whole idea is to pick it up early so we can treat it.\u201d\n\nAnd treatment can be extremely effective. Daily eye drops help lower the pressure in the eye, though sometimes ophthalmologists will use lasers or surgery.\n\nOnce your pressure is stabilized, you should have your eyes checked every four to six months, Buttross says; \u201cotherwise, if the pressure creeps up, you won\u2019t know it.\u201d\n\nPROTECT THE RETINA\n\nAge-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a disease where the cells in the central part of the retina \u2014 the part most important for central vision, called the macula \u2014 deteriorate.\n\nThough eyesight can be preserved when the disease is caught at an early stage, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention calls it \u201cthe leading cause of permanent impairment of reading and fine or close-up vision among people aged 65 years and older,\u201d and says 1.8 million Americans older than 40 have the condition and another 7.3 million are at risk of developing it.\n\nUnlike glaucoma, AMD, which runs in families, is a greater risk for whites than for African-Americans.\n\nThere are two kinds of AMD, dry and wet. More common is the dry, which can cause loss of central vision \u2014 essential for reading and driving \u2014 but so gradually that many people have it for decades with no obvious effect.\n\nWet, or neovascular, is more dangerous. Abnormal blood vessels grow into the retina, in some cases leading to bleeding or leaking of fluid.\n\nWet AMD is frightening, Pluznik says, because it may alter vision suddenly: \u201cPatients can wake up one day and just see a central black spot.\u201d\n\nDon Albrecht, 85, of Great Falls, Virginia, was recently diagnosed with dry AMD in his left eye and wet AMD in his right eye.\n\nThe warning sign came last fall, when he was watching a baseball game on TV and couldn\u2019t see certain details on the players\u2019 uniforms. He became alarmed and eventually was referred to a retina specialist, who treated his wet AMD with injections that eliminated the intruding blood vessels, a relatively new procedure.\n\n\u201cIf it had been 10 years ago,\u201d he says, \u201cI may have lost my sight.\u201d\n\nThe National Eye Institute\u2019s Age-Related Eye Disease Study found that people with AMD who take certain vitamins and minerals can slow the disease\u2019s progression. Those antioxidants include vitamins A and E, beta carotene, lutein, zinc and copper; they are sold over-the-counter in pill form as the AREDS formula. The researchers recently altered the mix by adding lutein and zeaxanthine and eliminating beta carotene. Called AREDS2, this formula is what ophthalmologists often suggest now.\n\nBecause these treatments can cause side effects, Buttross recommends checking with a doctor before taking them.\n\nAlong with the AREDS2 pills, ophthalmologists suggest a low-fat diet that includes fruits and vegetables, especially leafy greens such as spinach, kale and collard greens, and eating omega-3 fatty acids, which are found in salmon and tuna.\n\nAlbrecht says he eats lots of salad and takes AREDS2 supplements.\n\n\u201cI feel very lucky,\u201d he adds. \u201cI have an eye problem, but it\u2019s under control.\n\nTIPS FOR HEALTHY EYES\n\n\u25a0 Be alert to the early signs of vision problems.\n\n\u25a0 Protect eyes from ultraviolet light with sunglasses. Make sure yours offer full UV protection.\n\n\u25a0 Get regular comprehensive eye exams.\n\n\u25a0 Don\u2019t smoke.\n\n\u25a0 Keep weight normal to avoid diabetes.\n\n\u25a0 Control your blood pressure.\n\n\u25a0 Eat a diet rich in dark leafy greens and omega-3 fatty acids (found in foods such as salmon, flaxseed and walnuts).", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://health.heraldtribune.com/files/2014/09/shutterstock_182863580.jpg"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdda91\"", "article_summary": "There is no way to prevent glaucoma \u2014 or to restore the vision loss it causes \u2014 but its progression can be halted with early intervention.\nWorse, glaucoma and macular degeneration can pose serious threats to vision, making reading difficult and jeopardizing independent living.\nUnlike glaucoma, AMD, which runs in families, is a greater risk for whites than for African-Americans.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a normal part of the aging process, like getting gray hair,\u201d says Melanie Buttross, an ophthalmologist in Washington.\nAs time passes, the eye\u2019s lens becomes more opaque and dense, eventually causing blurry vision."}
