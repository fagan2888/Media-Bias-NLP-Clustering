Those numbers put the figure at 2.9 percent.\n\nSix months earlier, Johnson claimed Feingold \"was the deciding vote on Obamacare.\"\n\nOur rating: Mostly False.\n\nObamacare backers needed 60 yes votes, including Feingold\u2019s, on a crucial vote in the Senate that paved the way for final Senate passage of the health care reform bill. But to call it the deciding vote was misleading in that support from Feingold -- unlike some other senators who had to be persuaded to vote yes -- was never in doubt.\n\nCampaign financing\n\nFeingold changed his position on receiving campaign contributions from out-of-state donors, which put him to the test on our Flip-O-Meter in October 2015.\n\nOur rating: Full Flop.\n\nIn his four previous Senate campaigns, Feingold abided by a commitment to raise the majority of his campaign cash from Wisconsin residents. But he decided this time around that he is no longer bound by the pledge.\n\nA month after that ruling, the National Republican Senatorial Committee said Feingold \"wanted to get money out of politics. Now he's profiting from that same dark money.\"\n\nOur rating: Half True.\n\nFeingold received $59,500 in salary from Progressives United Inc., a non-profit founded by Feingold that is not required to disclose its donors, but stopped receiving payments in 2013. While it was active, the group voluntarily listed its donors on its website. But those lists are no longer readily accessible, since the group\u2019s website is no longer active.\n\nOther topics\n\nFeingold claimed Johnson had said specifically he hopes the first steps occur to privatize the Veterans Administration.\n\nOur rating: Half True.\n\nJohnson has advocated for privatizing at least parts of the VA system, but not for moving to a completely private system.\n\nJohnson said some 8.1 million of the estimated 11 million to 12 million people \"in this country illegally are working.\"\n\nOur rating: Mostly True.\n\nThe latest estimates from a nonpartisan research group showed that as of 2012, there were 8.1 million undocumented immigrants in the labor force -- some working, others looking for work.\n\nThe Wisconsin Democratic Party said Johnson has \"been in office nearly four years now, but 40% of Wisconsinites don't know who (U.S. Sen.) Ron Johnson is.\"\n\nOur rating: Mostly False.\n\nIn the most recent statewide poll that asked about Johnson, 40 percent of registered voters said they didn\u2019t know him well enough to have an opinion about him and another 4 percent said they didn\u2019t know if they had an opinion of him. But that falls short of evidence that 40 percent don't even know who he is.\n\nJohnson, meanwhile, changed his stance on support for the Export-Import Bank, which helps U.S. companies sell their goods and services in foreign countries by providing financing for export deals.\n\nOur rating: Full Flop.\n\nJohnson first voted against it reauthorizing the bank, then for it.\n\nFeingold said Johnson \"opposes entirely a federal minimum wage,\" except perhaps for \"guest workers.\"\n\nOur rating: True.\n\nWhen asked in July 2014 whether there should be a federal minimum wage, Johnson said there should not be one, other than perhaps one for guest workers. And while he may not be trying to repeal the wage, Johnson didn\u2019t dispute the accuracy of Feingold\u2019s claim.\n\nFeingold also said Johnson \"is opposed to all government-assisted student loans.\"\n\nOur rating: Mostly True.\n\nJohnson has said the government never should have gotten involved in student loans, shouldn\u2019t be involved in it and should look to gradually get out of it. But one of his votes helped student borrowers in the short term, though that measure could lead to higher interest rates in future years, since the rates are tied to changes in the financial markets.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Washington Post, the Fiscal Times and Roll Call are among the media ranking Wisconsin Republican Ron Johnson as one of the most vulnerable U.S. senators in the 2016 elections.
