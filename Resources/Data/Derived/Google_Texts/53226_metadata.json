Just the lines?\u201d Rubio pounced.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll have many different plans,\u201d Trump said, \u201cYou\u2019ll have competition, you\u2019ll have so many different plans.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow he\u2019s repeating himself!\u201d Rubio cried, relishing a bit of self-referential humor.\n\nHmm. (Adam Freelander)\n\nShortly thereafter, Cruz jumped in to push Trump again\u2014\u201ddid you say if you want people to die on the streets, if you don\u2019t support socialized health care, you have no heart?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are going to have private health care, but I will not allow people to die on the sidewalks and streets when I\u2019m president,\u201d Trump said.\n\nAnd this is the political bind Republicans face in their attempts to repeal Obamacare. For all the public concern over Big Government and higher taxes and exchange malfunctions, the law did boost health insurance coverage significantly thanks to its subsidies.\n\nRemoving the parts of the law that Republicans dislike most\u2014the mandate, the subsidies, the restrictions on insurance company behavior\u2014means telling some twenty million people they can\u2019t have health care. And that is why, nearly six years into Obamacare, the Republican party still has yet to get around to the second half of its repeal and replace plan.\n\nSo when Trump repeated his plan to keep the dead from piling up on American thoroughfares, Cruz must have thought he had the winning retort when he demanded, \u201cSo does the government pay for everyone\u2019s health care?\u201d\n\nBut Trump\u2014as is the front-runner\u2019s prerogative\u2014seemed happy to look ahead to the general election, where voters are less tolerant of sidewalk corpses and more willing to consider the government\u2019s role in providing health care.
