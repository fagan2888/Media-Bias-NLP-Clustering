That gap has been widening \u2014 in 2013, production jobs paid an average of $19.29 an hour, compared with $20.13 for all private-sector positions.\n\nPressured by temporary hiring practices and a sharp decrease in salaries in the auto parts sector, real wages for manufacturing workers fell 4.4 percent from 2003 to 2013, researchers found, nearly three times the decline for workers as a whole.\n\nDespite that widening gap, Washington still paints the manufacturing sector as a gateway to the middle class, even if the gate is closing.\n\nThe White House earmarked $100 million in grants last month to encourage manufacturing innovation, part of President Barack Obama\u2019s goal of adding 1 million manufacturing jobs by the end of his second term.\n\nAfter losing more than 6 million factory jobs from 2000 to 2010, the sector has rebounded a bit in recent years, with more than 700,000 positions created since early 2010. A total of 12.2 million Americans work in manufacturing, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\n\u201cWhile they are rebounding in numbers, which is good news, they are not delivering on the wages front,\u201d said Catherine Ruckelshaus, general counsel and program director at the National Employment Law Project.\n\nShe argued that if federal, state and local governments continued to promote manufacturing jobs with tax breaks and credits, employers should be encouraged to pay higher starting salaries and provide good benefits.\n\n\u201cIf you are getting a tax break or a subsidy, we should make sure those jobs are good jobs,\u201d Ruckelshaus said.\n\nBased in New York, the National Employment Law Project is a research and advocacy group for low-wage and unemployed workers. It receives some financial support from organized labor, including the United Steelworkers and the United Food and Commercial Workers unions, as well as the AFL-CIO. The data in the study was drawn mostly from government sources including the Bureau of Labor Statistics and the Census Bureau, and independent experts confirm many of the trends the group cites in the report.\n\n\u201cWe are not going to back to Detroit in the 1950s or Akron in the 1900s,\u201d said Lawrence Katz, a professor of economics at Harvard. \u201cThere still are many manufacturing jobs that are high-paying, but they tend to be more senior or require a lot more education than entry-level jobs do. And their numbers are shrinking too.\u201d\n\nEven if it does not continue to be a mass employer or a ticket to the middle class, Katz said, manufacturing remains vital to the economy because it spurs innovation and leads to higher-paying, value-added jobs such as design, marketing and other support services. It is also a major source of productivity gains, as well as a generator of profits and exports for American companies.\n\nBut most of those gains are not going to the workers on the factory floor. One major factor in the downward pressure on overall manufacturing wages has been a particularly sharp fall in hourly pay earned by workers like Eberhardt who make parts that supply the big automakers. Parts workers make about one-third less than assembly line workers who put together cars and trucks, but parts jobs account for 72 percent of auto sector employment. From 2003 to 2013, median wages for parts workers fell to $15.83 an hour from $18.35.\n\nThe auto industry in the United States, both parts makers and large auto companies including General Motors, have staged an impressive recovery since GM filed for bankruptcy in 2009 and required a federal bailout. Lower salaries and efficiency gains, along with less debt, have helped make Detroit more globally competitive.\n\nAt the same time, one of the most important reasons for lower pay is the increased use of temporary workers. Some manufacturers have turned to staffing agencies for hiring rather than employing workers directly on their own payroll. For the first half of 2014, these agencies supplied 1 out of 7 workers employed by auto parts manufacturers.\n\nThe increased use of these lower-paid workers, particularly on the assembly line, not only eats into the number of industry jobs available but also has a ripple effect on full-time, regular workers.\n\nEven veteran full-time auto parts workers who have managed to work their way up the assembly line chain of command have eked out only modest gains.\n\nNelson D.
