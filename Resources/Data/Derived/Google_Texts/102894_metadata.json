Once he staggered back to the bench, he started yelling in Giordano\u2019s general direction and then made a throat-slashing gesture.\n\nA cursory Google search of media coverage has found no mention of Kadri\u2019s Muslim religion, which provides the relevant cultural context for understanding this gesture. This is doubly odd, since Kadri\u2019s arrival in the NHL had been widely hailed, and his denunciation of Donald Trump\u2019s proposed ban on Muslim immigration received wide publicity on both sides of the border.\n\nRobert Spencer of Jihad Watch explains:\n\nWhen you grow up hearing \u201cWhen you meet the unbelievers, strike the necks\u201d (Qur\u2019an 47:4) and that sort of thing, even if you\u2019re not all that devout yourself, it\u2019s just possible that it might be in the back of your mind.\n\nIn fact, the current incident is not the first time Kadri has used this gesture:\n\nThe 25-year-old Kadri was disciplined for the same gesture while playing for Canada in a game against Switzerland at the 2010 world junior hockey championship. \u2026\n\nIt is clearly part of his cultural heritage, and now that Muslim immigrants are flooding onto the United States at an unprecedented rate, it can\u2019t be too much longer before throat-slashing becomes part of our culture. The NHL could even be accused of cultural insensitivity in fining him for his gesture. It may not be too long before such multi-culturalist dogma is applied.\n\nIn any event, we have a new kind of diversity to celebrate in our cultural mosaic.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.americanthinker.com/blog/2016/02/muslim_nhl_player_makes_throatslashing_gesture_after_a_hit_on_the_ice.html", "image": "http://www.americanthinker.com/images/bucket/2016-02/196079_5_.png", "title": "Blog: Muslim NHL player makes throat-slashing gesture after a hit on the ice"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Once he staggered back to the bench, he started yelling in Giordano\u2019s general direction and then made a throat-slashing gesture.\nToronto Maple Leafs\u2019 forward Nazem Kadri has been fined U.S. $5,000 for making a throat-slashing gesture after taking a hit in a game in Calgary last Tuesday.\nKadri was rocked by a big open-ice hit from Giordano and was slow to get up off the ice.\nA cursory Google search of media coverage has found no mention of Kadri\u2019s Muslim religion, which provides the relevant cultural context for understanding this gesture.\nThe NHL could even be accused of cultural insensitivity in fining him for his gesture."}
