Dave Weigel – a longtime Slate correspondent and now a Bloomberg reporter – stopped by “Midterm Mayhem” to talk about (what else?) the upcoming midterm election.

Weigel predicted that if Republicans win the Senate “they’re going to make the President a piñata instead of a lame duck for the last two years” of his second term by blocking his priorities while chopping away at some of his accomplishments like Obamacare.

He also answers burning questions such as, will ISIS crush the Democrats? Will Ebola crush the Democrats? Will same-sex marriage crush the Democrats?

And most importantly: Are people even aware there’s an election happening soon?
