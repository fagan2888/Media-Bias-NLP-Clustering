But here\u2019s the consummate insider who buys politicians, Republicans and Democrats. He\u2019s given $300,000 to Democrats, 300,000 to Republicans, when they ask him why, he says, [paraphrasing] \u2018Well, I give to them so they\u2019ll do whatever the I tell them to do.\u2019 Well, that doesn\u2019t sound like we want to change Washington. That sounds like the old ways of buying politicians. And I\u2019m horrified by the idea that we could consider someone who buys and sells politicians. He\u2019s bought access to the Clintons, and we think, \u2018Well, gosh it\u2019s despicable that she would sell access.\u2019 But isn\u2019t it equally despicable that he\u2019s willing to buy access?\u201d\n\nRand addressed Trump\u2019s accusations that he had received donations from Trump, Rand said, \u201cNot exactly true. I do charity work through the University of Utah. And he has contributed to the University of Utah, towards my mission work. I\u2019ll be leaving in a week to do cataract surgery in Haiti. And actually, he is a generous man, he is philanthropic, but that\u2019s a little bit different than buying and selling politicians, giving to the University of Utah Eye Center.\u201d\n\nRand also addressed his spat with Chris Christie on the NSA during the debate, Rand argued, \u201cOn all of the instances where we have been attacked, we have had suspicion. The Boston bomber, we were tipped off. The Garland shooter, we had some evidence in advance. The Major Hassan mass murder in Houston, there was evidence to suspect him in advance. I\u2019m all for targeted investigation, I\u2019m just not for the sweeping surveillance state, where we get all Americans\u2019 records without saying that there\u2019s any suspicion. It goes against the Fourth Amendment, and does invade our right to privacy.\u201d\n\nHe added of his criticism of Christie for hugging President Obama after Hurricane Sandy, \u201cWell, this is a guy that\u2019s accusing me of something to do with fundraising. And if you will recall, he actually used taxpayer dollars, that was supposed to go to Sandy victims, to campaign for the governorship. This is illegal in most states. He spent millions, I mean, I think at least $5 million he spent on TV, taxpayer money of him strutting around, acting like he was bringing all this money for Sandy. Not his money, the taxpayer money. But, these were self-aggrandizement and and advertisements, during the middle of a campaign. He should be ashamed of himself, and he should actually pay the taxpayers back for using that money.\u201d\n\nFollow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett", "article_metadata": {"description": "Rand Paul asked if people belief the Clintons selling access is wrong, \"isn't it equally despicable\" for Donald Trump to buy access", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Rand Paul asked if people belief the Clintons selling access is wrong, \"isn't it equally despicable\" for Donald Trump to buy access", "title": "Rand: 'Isn't It Equally Despicable' That Trump Buys Access? - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 475, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/08/Rand-87-Thumbnail.jpg", "height": 356}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/video/2015/08/08/rand-isnt-it-equally-despicable-that-trump-buys-access/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Rand Paul asked if people belief the Clintons selling access is wrong, \"isn't it equally despicable\" for Donald Trump to buy access", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/08/Rand-87-Thumbnail.jpg", "title": "Rand: 'Isn't It Equally Despicable' That Trump Buys Access? - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Chris Christie, Donald Trump, NSA, Rand Paul,2016 Presidential Race, Breitbart TV,Rand", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "2016 Presidential Race", "tag": "Rand Paul", "published_time": "2015-08-08T11:53:45-07:00", "categories": "Breitbart TV,2016 Presidential Race"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "He\u2019s bought access to the Clintons, and we think, \u2018Well, gosh it\u2019s despicable that she would sell access.\u2019 But isn\u2019t it equally despicable that he\u2019s willing to buy access?\u201dRand addressed Trump\u2019s accusations that he had received donations from Trump, Rand said, \u201cNot exactly true.\nNot his money, the taxpayer money.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERKentucky Senator and GOP presidential candidate Rand Paul asked if people belief the Clintons selling access is wrong, \u201cisn\u2019t it equally despicable\u201d for fellow GOP candidate Donald Trump to buy access on Friday\u2019s \u201cO\u2019Reilly Factor\u201d on the Fox News ChannelSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERRand said of Trump, \u201cHe\u2019s trying to run as an outsider.\nHe spent millions, I mean, I think at least $5 million he spent on TV, taxpayer money of him strutting around, acting like he was bringing all this money for Sandy.\nAnd I\u2019m horrified by the idea that we could consider someone who buys and sells politicians."}
