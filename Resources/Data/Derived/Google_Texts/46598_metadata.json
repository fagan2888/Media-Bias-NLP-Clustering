He said that heading up the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People has kept him away from his family too much. Jealous has a wife and two young children.\n\n\u201cLeadership knows when to step up and when to step down,\u201d Jealous told the publication. \u201cThis day I can say with pride that I\u2019m prepared to step down and make room for the next person who will lead this organization to its next chapter.\u201d\n\nThe 40-year-old also told USA Today that he will start a new organization to help place more blacks in political office, calling it something of an \u201cEmily\u2019s List for people of color.\u201d\n\nHis departure came at a time in which the NAACP was seemingly poised to work more with some Republicans to overturn the Supreme Court\u2019s decision on the Voting Rights Act.\n\nJealous, who had been president of the NAACP since 2008, spoke at the National Press Club in late August about how the Republican Party can win back the black vote. He said the Republican Party has the makings of a \u201cgreat civil rights agenda\u201d and the ability to make substantial strides with the crucial voting bloc.\n\n\u201cLike [Julian] Bond, I grew up in a family with a great sense of history and a part of that history is a deep appreciation for the party of Lincoln and the role that it played historically,\u201d the NAACP President said. \u201c\u2026The Republican Party has a proud legacy when it comes to civil rights.\u201d\n\nHe continued, noting the recent reforms states \u2014 all led by Republican governors \u2014 have made to contribute to what he calls \u201ca great GOP civil rights agenda.\u201d Jealous noted initiatives in Alabama, focusing on early childhood education, Texas and Georgia, working to downsize the prison system, and Virginia, granting \u2018second chances\u2019 in employment and voting.\n\n\u201cOur country is becoming a majority people of color and [the Republicans] need to ask themselves can they survive \u2026 or do they need to go back to their deeper roots and become not just the party of Lincoln but the party of Frederick Douglass as well,\u201d Jealous said. \u201cWhen I look at Republican governors out there, you have the makings, if you put their different planks together, of a great GOP civil rights agenda.\u201d\n\nThe NAACP President \u2014 who spoke at the 50th Anniversary of the March on Washington \u2014 also expressed concern about the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s ruling on Shelby County v. Holder. The case overturned Section 4 of the Voting Rights Act \u2014 which 80 percent of Congressional Republicans voted to pass in 1964 \u2014 and since its ruling, many states have taken steps to enact voter ID laws. This, Jealous, said, hurts young Americans and people of color most, but he was hopeful members of the Republican House leadership could lead the GOP in reinstating the provision.\n\n\u201cWhat I was most heartened by was the message that Speaker Boehner delivered to a Republican gathering in recent days over at the RNC headquarters talking about his commitment to Section 4 of the Voting Rights Act,\u201d Jealous said of the RNC\u2019s luncheon commemorating the March. \u201cI\u2019m heartened by the signals that Majority Leader Cantor has sent that he might be willing to support the same thing.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m hopeful that Mr. Boehner will be able to look into his heart and more importantly look into the eyes of John Lewis and recognize that on this one, any sort of recent tradition of we don\u2019t put anything forward unless the majority of the party is in alignment, that in this case it might be worth it to let this be the exception.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"generator": "NGFB Pro 7.8.4U", "og": {"site_name": "Red Alert Politics", "description": "NAACP president Benjamin Jealous is stepping down from his post with the organization, he announced Sunday.", "title": "NAACP President Benjamin Jealous to step down - Red Alert Politics", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 400, "identifier": "http://redalertpolitics.com/files/2012/02/tdionisopoulos_avatar-400x400.jpg", "height": 400}, "url": "http://redalertpolitics.com/2013/09/08/naacp-president-benjamin-jealous-to-step-down/", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 1285945407, "app_id": 529886110401651}, "msvalidate.01": "0F003B4674EABE0F24651B476B61A43C", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/RedAlertPolitics", "tag": "voting-rights-act", "published_time": "2013-09-08T19:43:04+00:00", "modified_time": "2013-09-09T10:26:32+00:00", "author": "melissa.quinn.9461"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "NAACP president Benjamin Jealous is stepping down from his post with the organization, he announced Sunday.\n\u201cLeadership knows when to step up and when to step down,\u201d Jealous told the publication.\nJealous, who had been president of the NAACP since 2008, spoke at the National Press Club in late August about how the Republican Party can win back the black vote.\nHe said the Republican Party has the makings of a \u201cgreat civil rights agenda\u201d and the ability to make substantial strides with the crucial voting bloc.\nJealous made his Dec. 31 departure known during an interview with USA Today on Sunday."}
