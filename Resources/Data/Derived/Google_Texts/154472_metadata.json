Bernie Sanders by painting herself as a \u201cprogressive who likes to get things done\u201d has left some voters and observers confused about the core message of her second presidential bid. It now seems that frustration has spread to the former secretary of state herself.\n\nOn Monday, Politico reported that Clinton and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, are unhappy with, among other things, her campaign\u2019s muddled message and are planning a major staff shake-up after the New Hampshire primary on Tuesday night, where the former First Lady is expected to finish second to Sanders.\n\nRelated: How Gloria Steinem and Madeleine Albright Misplayed Clinton\u2019s Gender Card\n\n\u201cThe Clintons are not happy, and have been letting all of us know that,\u201d one Democratic Party official told Politico. \u201cThe idea is that we need a more forward-looking message, for the primary \u2014 but also for the general election too.\u2026 There\u2019s no sense of panic, but there is an urgency to fix these problems right now.\u201d\n\nIn an interview with MSNBC, Clinton said she\u2019d seen the report and remains \u201cvery confident\u201d about her staff, but she didn\u2019t reject the idea of an overhaul.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to take stock, what works, what doesn\u2019t work. We\u2019re moving into a different phase of the campaign. We\u2019re moving into a more diverse electorate. We\u2019re moving into different geographic areas,\u201d she said. \u201cSo, of course it would be malpractice not to say, \u2018OK, what worked? What can we do better? What do we have to do new and different that we have to pull out?\u2019\u201d\n\nLooking back at last week\u2019s Democratic presidential debate, it\u2019s not hard to see why Clinton\u2019s camp is frustrated. She and Sanders spent much of the first hour bickering over what it means to be a \u201cprogressive\u201d and who deserves to wear that title. Clinton mocked Sanders for appointing himself \u201cgatekeeper\u201d of the label and Sanders responded by highlighting Clinton\u2019s ties to Wall Street.\n\nRelated: Sanders Closes the Gap on Clinton \u2014 and Cleans Up Against the GOP\n\nThe exchange, while at times nebulous, was nonetheless a defining exchange in a Democratic race in which the leading candidates have veered to the left more than in any presidential campaign since 1972.\n\nSanders and former Maryland Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley, who dropped out last week after a dismal showing in Iowa, continually charged Clinton with leading from behind on several issues, including immigration, the Keystone XL pipeline and others.\n\nClinton\u2019s attempt to negate those charges has resulted in a severe course correction, with her seesawing between staking out liberal stances aimed specifically at the party\u2019s base and scolding Sanders for policy proposals that are just \u201cwishful thinking,\u201d as she described her rival\u2019s estimated $14 trillion healthcare plan.\n\nRelated: Clinton Attacks Sanders\u2019 $14 Trillion Health Plan as \u2018Wishful Thinking\u2019\n\nThe tiptoe act has seemingly left Clinton unmoored to either the liberal or moderate camps \u2014 and struggling to define the central rationale for her candidacy. Clinton and some surrogates have at times highlighted the goal of electing the first woman president, but comments by Gloria Steinem and former Secretary of State Madeline Alrbight chastising women who don\u2019t support Clinton have sparked a backlash.\n\nContrast that with Sanders, whose message has been sharply focused on income inequality and the sins of the \u201cbillionaire class.\u201d\n\nTalk of the staff shake-up, on the heels of last week\u2019s Iowa caucuses, where Clinton managed to eke out a win victory over Sanders by a fraction of a percentage point, has some thinking back to 2008 when she was upset in the Hawkeye State and had to throw everything but the kitchen sink into winning the New Hampshire primary. She weighed turning over her staff after New Hampshire four years ago as well.\n\nDavid Axelrod, the chief architect of both of President Obama\u2019s White House campaigns, suggested on Twitter that the woes roiling Clinton\u2019s camp come from the top.\n\nWhen the exact same problems crop up in separate campaigns, with different staff, at what point do the principals say, \"Hey, maybe it's US?\" \u2014 David Axelrod (@davidaxelrod) February 8, 2016\n\nAny kind of reshuffle by Clinton will likely spark more doubts about her candidacy heading into Nevada\u2019s Democratic caucuses on Feb. 20. The nation\u2019s former No. 1 diplomat is supposed to have the edge in the Silver State, thanks to its large Hispanic population. Nevada, along with the South Carolina primary on Feb. 27, are supposed to make up Clinton\u2019s \u201cfirewall\u201d and help deny Sanders the nomination.\n\nRecently, though, Clinton has begun to show signs of worry. Her campaign launched its first Spanish-language radio spot in Nevada on Friday, and Bill Clinton spent two days there last week to gin up enthusiasm.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Hillary Clinton\u2019s attempts to blunt the popularity of Vermont Sen.", "title": "Has Clinton\u2019s Move to the Left Backfired?", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/02/09/Has-Clinton-s-Move-Left-Backfired", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-election-clinton_3.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/02/09/Has-Clinton-s-Move-Left-Backfired", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-election-clinton_3.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Hillary Clinton\u2019s attempts to blunt the popularity of Vermont Sen.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Related: How Gloria Steinem and Madeleine Albright Misplayed Clinton\u2019s Gender Card\u201cThe Clintons are not happy, and have been letting all of us know that,\u201d one Democratic Party official told Politico.\nClinton mocked Sanders for appointing himself \u201cgatekeeper\u201d of the label and Sanders responded by highlighting Clinton\u2019s ties to Wall Street.\nWhen the exact same problems crop up in separate campaigns, with different staff, at what point do the principals say, \"Hey, maybe it's US?\"\nNevada, along with the South Carolina primary on Feb. 27, are supposed to make up Clinton\u2019s \u201cfirewall\u201d and help deny Sanders the nomination.\nWhat do we have to do new and different that we have to pull out?\u2019\u201dLooking back at last week\u2019s Democratic presidential debate, it\u2019s not hard to see why Clinton\u2019s camp is frustrated."}
