Republican desires to gut Obama\u2019s legacies such as the Affordable Care Act and the Dodd-Frank bank reform law would meet the usual Democratic filibuster.\"Disagreements between parties and between interest groups would be as they always were. Before long, people will be lumping Trump into the category of 'all talk no action politicians.'\"For Trump to even make it to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue would knock America off its feet, even though he has been out front since practically announcing his candidacy. Larry Sabato of the University of Virginia\u2019s Center for Politics recently wrote in his \"Crystal Ball\" that \"if Trump is nominated, then everything we think we know about presidential nominations is wrong.\"Even Trump\u2019s brash comments about minorities and women, which would likely have sunk another candidate, have only seemed to bolster Trump in the eyes of his supporters.\"As inappropriate as some of his comments are, I think it\u2019s stuff that a lot of people are thinking but afraid to say,\" supporter Lisa Carey, 51, of Greenfield, New Hampshire, told The New York Times . \"And I\u2019m a woman.\"Another Granite State Trump supporter, 54-year-old teacher Lori Szostkiewicz, told the newspaper that it\u2019s Trump\u2019s boldness that is part of his appeal.\"I want people who are negotiating with him to believe my president when he says he\u2019s going to do something,\" Szostkiewicz said. \"I want to negotiate from a position of strength, not weakness.\"", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "donald trump, president, congress, constitution", "pubdate": "2015-08-24T08:17:27", "og": {"site_name": "Newsmax", "description": "Should Donald Trump end up winning the White House, despite all the bluster, \"the constitutional constraints of the office would become apparent\" and relegate the real estate tycoon to the same challenges faced by those before him, according to Politico.", "title": "Politico: President Trump Would Be 'Hog-Tied' by DC Politics Too", "url": "http://www.newsmax.com/Newsfront/donald-trump-president-congress-constitution/2015/08/24/id/671536/", "type": "article", "image": "http://www.newsmax.com/CMSPages/GetFile.aspx?guid=3bf5a71c-b234-4721-86cc-a37ce82593c7&SiteName=Newsmax", "page_id": 85452072376}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.newsmax.com/Newsfront/donald-trump-president-congress-constitution/2015/08/24/id/671536/", "title": "Politico: President Trump Would Be 'Hog-Tied' by DC Politics Too", "description": "Should Donald Trump end up winning the White House, despite all the bluster, \"the constitutional constraints of the office would become apparent\" and relegate the real estate tycoon to the same challenges faced by those before him, according to Politico.", "site": "Newsmax"}, "fb": {"admins": 100002083767056, "app_id": 323020797885219}, "msvalidate.01": "FAF1322EC761685A5DD9344A1C19E82A", "epoch": 1440404247, "google-site-verification": "Jt2HUKgzJJw9VwIQJv31ETytuvNNm5ypTWN6j0nYvHM", "keywords": "donald trump, president, congress, constitution", "article": {"section": "Newsfront", "published_time": "2015-08-24T08:17:27"}, "original-source": "http://www.newsmax.com/Newsfront/donald-trump-president-congress-constitution/2015/08/24/id/671536/", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "description": "Should Donald Trump end up winning the White House, despite all the bluster,  the constitutional constraints of the office would become apparent  and relegate the real estate tycoon to the same challenges faced by those before him, according to Politico."}, "article_summary": "\"Another Granite State Trump supporter, 54-year-old teacher Lori Szostkiewicz, told the newspaper that it\u2019s Trump\u2019s boldness that is part of his appeal.\n\"But beyond that, he would be hog-tied by a divided Congress, just as those who have served before him.\n\"I want people who are negotiating with him to believe my president when he says he\u2019s going to do something,\" Szostkiewicz said.\nBefore long, people will be lumping Trump into the category of 'all talk no action politicians.\n\"Even Trump\u2019s brash comments about minorities and women, which would likely have sunk another candidate, have only seemed to bolster Trump in the eyes of his supporters."}
