Photo: AFP\n\nGiorgio Chiellini stole the show in Italy's win over Azerbaijan while the Netherlands escaped acute embarrassment and Belgium went on a goal blitz in Euro 2016 qualifying on Friday.\n\nNew Holland manager Guus Hiddink was heading for a second successive defeat after lowly Kazakhstan, ranked 127th in the world, took an early first half lead in Amsterdam.\n\nBut Klaas Jan Huntelaar cancelled out Russian-born defender Rinat Abdulin's shock 17th minute opener with Ibrahim Afellay and Robin van Persie from the penalty spot ensuring potential disaster was averted.\n\nLate blitz: Ibrahim Afellay celebrates his goal for the Dutch.

This is a win that will serve us well for the future.\"\n\nNorway are lying third in Group H after a 3-0 win in Malta with the goals coming from two players from the English Championship - Cardiff teenager Mats Moller Daehli and Blackburn Rovers forward Joshua King, who got a double.\n\nReal Madrid's Gareth Bale was unable to work his magic for Wales as Chris Coleman's side were held to a goalless draw by Bosnia-Hercegovina in Cardiff.\n\nAfter an opening win over Andorra Wales were left top of Group B, ahead of favourites Belgium, who got their Euro 2016 campaign up and running with a 6-0 rout of minnows Andorra.\n\nIsrael beat Cyprus 2-1 in Group B's other game in Nicosia.\n\nThe road to the Euro 2016 finals continues on Saturday with World Cup winners Germany in Poland and Scotland hosting Georgia.\n\nAFP", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Soccer", "application-name": "The Sydney Morning Herald", "og": {"site_name": "The Sydney Morning Herald", "description": "Giorgio Chiellini stole the show in Italy's win over Azerbaijan while the Netherlands escaped acute embarrassment and Belgium went on a goal blitz in Euro 2016 qualifying on Friday.", "title": "Italy's Giorgio Chiellini bags unusual hat-trick as Belgium, Netherlands win in Euro 2016 qualifying", "url": "http://www.smh.com.au/sport/soccer/italys-giorgio-chiellini-bags-unusual-hattrick-as-belgium-netherlands-win-in-euro-2016-qualifying-20141010-114lkq.html", "image": "http://www.smh.com.au/content/dam/images/3/h/r/z/3/image.related.articleLeadwide.620x349.114lkq.png/1413010044240.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@smh", "image": {"src": "http://www.smh.com.au/content/dam/images/3/h/r/z/3/image.related.articleLeadwide.620x349.114lkq.png/1413010044240.jpg"}, "description": "Giorgio Chiellini stole the show in Italy's win over Azerbaijan while the Netherlands escaped acute embarrassment and Belgium went on a goal blitz in Euro 2016 qualifying on Friday.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Italy's Giorgio Chiellini bags unusual hat-trick as Belgium, Netherlands win in Euro 2016 qualifying"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "Open The Sydney Morning Herald", "robots": "ACAP allow-present prohibited-modification=annotation", "fb": {"app_id": 193677504039845}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.smh.com.au", "msapplication-task": "name=Weather;action-uri=http://www.smh.com.au/weather;icon-uri=http://www.smh.com.au/favicon.ico;", "description": "Giorgio Chiellini stole the show in Italy's win over Azerbaijan while the Netherlands escaped acute embarrassment and Belgium went on a goal blitz in Euro 2016 ..."}, "article_summary": "EURO 2016 QUALIFYING WRAPRedemption: Giorgio Chiellini celebrates his third goal of Italy's 2-1 win.\nPhoto: AFPGiorgio Chiellini stole the show in Italy's win over Azerbaijan while the Netherlands escaped acute embarrassment and Belgium went on a goal blitz in Euro 2016 qualifying on Friday.\nThe road to the Euro 2016 finals continues on Saturday with World Cup winners Germany in Poland and Scotland hosting Georgia.\nAdvertisementIn Palermo, Chiellini scored all the goals in Italy's 2-1 win over Azerbaijan to push the Azzurri on top of Group H on goal difference from Croatia, who saw off Bulgaria 1-0.\nAfter an opening win over Andorra Wales were left top of Group B, ahead of favourites Belgium, who got their Euro 2016 campaign up and running with a 6-0 rout of minnows Andorra."}
