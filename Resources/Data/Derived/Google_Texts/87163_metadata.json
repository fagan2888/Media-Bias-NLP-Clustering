The extra time King spent on the practice floor and in the weight room during last season\u2019s redshirt season clearly is paying dividends.\n\n\u201cI came in my freshman year at about 200 pounds, and I couldn\u2019t even bench my weight,\u201d King said. \u201cNow I\u2019m about 225, and I\u2019m maxing out at 265 on the bench. That\u2019s a lot for a basketball player. My squat, it\u2019s still not great, but it\u2019s improved. My body fat has gone down, my weight has gone up. I credit that to Laura (Anderson), our nutritionist, and obviously our strength and conditioning coach, James Hardy.\u201d\n\nA post player who was required to outlet the ball the moment he grabbed any rebound for Brennan High School in San Antonio, King appeared in 27 games as a true freshman in the 2013-14 season but contributed minimally, averaging about 5.5 minutes and 1.5 points per game while adjusting his game to playing away from the basket.\n\nHead coach Tad Boyle proposed the somewhat unorthodox notion of having King redshirt his second year, instead of during the more customary first year on campus.\n\nAlthough it was an unusual approach, Boyle and Hardy noted that often it helps young players to get a true taste of the competition at the next level before understanding the level of commitment required not only to compete but to thrive.\n\n\u201cIf you redshirt them as a freshman, they don\u2019t know what college basketball is all about,\u201d Boyle said. \u201cThey haven\u2019t been exposed. They haven\u2019t been on the road. They don\u2019t know what their weaknesses are. They play their freshman year, and they find out, \u2018Hey, I\u2019m not very good defensively. My jump shot, I\u2019ve got to get it off quicker at this level.\u2019\n\n\u201cThey find out where those weaknesses are in their game their freshman year. So then their redshirt year, they can work on those things they know they have to work on. If they\u2019d never gone through that, they don\u2019t know what their weaknesses are.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Year off; pays off; for red-hot George King", "title": "Year off; pays off; for red-hot George King", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/11/28/year-off-pays-off-for-red-hot-george-king/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151128__George-Kingp1.jpg", "height": 478}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151128__George-Kingp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-11-28T21:22:29+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-20T06:19:10+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "University of Colorado"}, "article_summary": "\u201cI came in my freshman year at about 200 pounds, and I couldn\u2019t even bench my weight,\u201d King said.\nHead coach Tad Boyle proposed the somewhat unorthodox notion of having King redshirt his second year, instead of during the more customary first year on campus.\nThe extra time King spent on the practice floor and in the weight room during last season\u2019s redshirt season clearly is paying dividends.\nWhen he arrived at the University of Colorado, King was a dominant post player who nonetheless could not bench-press his own weight.\nThrough five games, King is averaging 18.2 points and 5.4 rebounds per game while shooting .480 (12-for-25) from 3-point range and .500 overall."}
