REDDING Calif. -

For those filing taxes this year, the Affordable Healthcare Act could have some implications.

Starting Feb. 15, those who are not insured could face steep financial penalties, such as $325 per person or 2 percent of family income, whichever one is higher.

Those filing taxes will have to state whether or not they are insured, and whether tax credits pay for that insurance. Only 4 million Americans will be affected by financial penalties, according to a prediction from H&R Block.

A variety of hardships will make many exempt from paying the penalties, such as the death of a close relative or the cancellation of a previous healthcare plan.

"Our healthcare is now related to our taxes and the IRS is going to be monitoring all this, it's just a bad idea," said Dr. Danny Stills, a Redding resident.

"It's a good thing if things go through, and things are paid like they're supposed to be," said Bill LaHue, a Redding resident.

Eighty-seven percent of those enrolled in Obamacare plans will qualify for a federal subsidy or tax credit to help pay monthly premiums. This will be available for anyone at one to four times the federal poverty level - $11,670 for an individual or $23,850 for a family of four.

A Turbotax survey released this month said half of U.S. adults are unaware they must report their health insurance status on their 2014 tax returns.
