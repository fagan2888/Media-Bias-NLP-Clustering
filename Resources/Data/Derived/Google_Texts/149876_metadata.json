Southeast Housing received a 50-year ground lease from the Navy for a nominal payment of $10.\n\n\n\nIn 2012, the property appraiser issued tax liens for the years 2008 to 2011, with the tax issues involving buildings and other improvements on the property.\n\n\n\nSoutheast Housing filed a lawsuit challenging the attempt to collect property taxes. Noting that since the \"early years of the American Republic, it has been recognized that the property of the United States is immune from state taxation,'' a three-judge panel of the appeals court rejected the appraiser's arguments.\n\n\n\n\"A review \u2026 reveals that the Navy retained equitable and beneficial ownership of the properties,'' said the ruling written by Judge Thomas Logue and joined by Chief Judge Frank Shepherd and Judge Kevin Emas. \"Because property owned by the United States is immune from state taxation, we hold the properties are immune from Florida ad valorem (property) taxes.\"\n\nCopyright 2015 by The News Service of Florida.
