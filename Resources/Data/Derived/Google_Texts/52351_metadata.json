Bernie Sanders speaks during a town hall meeting Tuesday at Memminger Auditorium in Charleston. Sanders has tapped into issues that are popular with young voters.\n\nWhen it comes to drugs, gay rights and other social issues, millennial voters in South Carolina are often on the same page. But whether their voices will make a difference in the state\u2019s primaries remains to be seen.\n\nThe Post and Courier interviewed about two dozen voters in the 18-35 age bracket this week and found many shared similar concerns and viewpoints on social issues, regardless of party affiliation. That appears to fit with a recent USA Today/Rock The Vote poll, which found that a majority of young voters are socially liberal and fiscally moderate or conservative.\n\nTake Anna Chapman, chairwoman of the College Republicans club at the University of South Carolina. She said her main concerns revolve around \u201cthe debt and spending, taxes, what we\u2019re going to do about Social Security and Medicare.\u201d She also sees herself and most of her young peers as \u201cdefinitely more pro-gay marriage, definitely for ... marijuana legalization, and pro-criminal justice reform.\u201d\n\nAmanda Nagle, a Democrat on campus, agreed. While her friends in both parties disagree on the details, \u201cmost students share social values,\u201d she said.\n\nYoung voters across partisan lines tend to be more concerned with addressing economic problems, education and health care reform, according to a Harvard Public Opinion Project poll reported in December.\n\nPalmetto State millennials echoed that point in interviews. Their top concerns: college debt, national debt, education and economic inequities, as well as Wall Street\u2019s influence on Capitol Hill.\n\nWhether their views will shake up the field in the South Carolina primaries, as other young voters have done in New Hampshire and Iowa, depends on whether the group, which makes up a quarter of the state\u2019s voters, shows up to the polls.\n\nBig on issues\n\nThe millennial generation includes people born between 1980-1996. They came of age at a time of ongoing foreign conflicts, economic hardships and political gridlock, influencing their views in myriad ways.\n\nMany are struggling to pay off college debt, which has become a top concern for millennial voters nationwide. Taylor Mason, a 24-year-old Republican in Greenville, said he wished the issue had been discussed more during the race.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t think of any other industry that can raise their prices by 15 percent a year without providing any additional services or any guaranteed outcomes, beside the higher education system,\u201d he said.\n\nMatt Stuemke, 32, of Sullivan\u2019s Island, showed up to Sen. Bernie Sanders\u2019 rally Tuesday at the Memminger Auditorium. He hoped to hear more ideas about making college tuition more affordable and health care reform \u2014 issues that have been drawing millennials to Sanders\u2019 rallies in droves. The senator, though a political independent from Vermont, is running in the Democratic primary.\n\n\u201cBernie is the only one getting me excited right now,\u201d he said.\n\nJoe Semsar, 28, of Mount Pleasant, said he\u2019s volunteering for Sen. Marco Rubio\u2019s campaign because he \u201cis more of a unifier and less of a divider.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think there is a growing body of young people that are concerned about the financial health of the country,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need somebody in the White House that takes those issues very serious.\u201d\n\nPhil Ford, 28, of Florence, said he supports Hillary Clinton because \u201cshe has the knowledge and experience to grow the Affordable Care Act into universal health care for all people,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cI\u2019ve been without health insurance before, and it can be a crushing debt.\u201d\n\nWill they matter?\n\nMillennials can be passionate about their issues, but that doesn\u2019t always translate to the polls. Overall, young people represented just 13 percent of voters in 2008.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s one of the age groups that sort of votes, historically, at the lowest turnout rates. So I think that is a challenge for that group,\u201d said Gibbs Knotts, chairman of the political science department at the College of Charleston.\n\nMillennials tend to skew Democratic, even in South Carolina. About 63 percent of those ages 18-35 who voted in 2008 did so in the state\u2019s Democratic primary, while the Republican primary drew about 36 percent.\n\nChapman, of USC, said she\u2019s been trying to encourage more young Republicans to vote in this election by handing out registration forms and educating her peers about absentee ballots.\n\n\u201cI think it takes what I\u2019m doing on a massive level,\u201d she said. \u201cI know that if people in my age group voted at a rate that older people do, I think we might see different candidates.\u201d\n\nLee Hartsell, 25, of Mount Pleasant, said he thinks Sanders\u2019 youthful following could influence the Democratic Party to address millennials\u2019 top concerns.\n\n\u201cI think that the whole point of standing up is, yeah, get enough people, and they\u2019ll listen, because they want to keep their jobs,\u201d he said.\n\nScott Hoffmon, a Winthrop political science professor, said it\u2019s unlikely the youth vote will propel a candidate to victory in South Carolina. But a strong turnout means they could begin to see their views reflected in both parties.\n\n\u201cOnce they realize their strength, they will begin to change the course of politics, because politicians will have no choice but to speak to their interests.\u201d\n\nReach Abigail Darlington at 937-5906 and follow her on Twitter @A_Big_Gail", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "In an era of polarity, S.C.\u2019s millennial voters find common ground on social, economic issues, Politics, \r\nPoliticsElections, \r\nFP LatestNews, \r\nMetro, \r\nMetro, Bernie Sanders,Hillary Clinton,Marco Rubio,millennial generation,Millennials,South Carolina Democratic Party,South Carolina Democratic Primary,South Carolina Republican Party,South Carolina Republican Primary", "og": {"site_name": "Post and Courier", "description": "When it comes to drugs, gay rights and other social issues, millennial voters in South Carolina are often on the same page.
