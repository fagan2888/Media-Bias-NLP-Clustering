Why is this happening? In an insightful column in today's Washington Post, Robert Samuelson suggests an explanation based on the work of economist Mancur Olson, As I have explained earlier public choice theorist, Mancur Olson, argued in The Rise and Decline of Nations (1982) that economic stagnation and even decline set in when powerful special-interest lobbies\u2014crony capitalists if you will\u2014capture a country's regulatory system and use it to block competitors, making the economy ever less efficient. The growing burden of regulation could some day even turn economic growth negative.\n\nSamuelson notes that wage increases have histroically tracked increases in economic productivity. Last year productivity increased by only 0.5 percent. This contrasts with a late 20th century rate averaging about 2 percent per year. Samuelson then turns to Olson for a possible explanation for the slow-down in productivity: the proliferation of regulations adopted to protect special interests. From Samuelson:\n\nAlthough an economist, Olson revolutionized thinking about the political power of interest groups. Until Olson, conventional wisdom held that large groups were more powerful than small groups in pursuing their self-interest \u2014 say, a government subsidy, tax preference or a protective tariff. Bigness conveyed power. Just the opposite, Olson said in his 1965 book \u201cThe Logic of Collective Action.\u201d With so many people in the large group, the benefits of collective action were often spread so thinly that no individual had much of an incentive to become politically active. The tendency was to \u201clet George do it,\u201d but George had no incentive either. By contrast, the members of smaller groups often could see the benefits of their collective action directly. They were motivated to organize and to pursue their self-interest aggressively. Here\u2019s an example: A company and its workers lobby for import protection, which saves jobs and raises prices and profits. But consumers \u2014 who pay the higher prices \u2014 don\u2019t create a counter-lobby, because it\u2019s too much trouble and the higher prices are diluted among many individual consumers. Gains are concentrated, losses dispersed. The dilemma for democracies is clear. Voters expect governments to cater to their needs and wants \u2014 and one person\u2019s special interest is another\u2019s way of life or moral crusade. But if governments cater too aggressively to interest groups, they may undermine (or have already done so) the gains in productivity and economic growth that voters also expect. So this is another possible explanation for the productivity slowdown, which afflicts many advanced countries. These societies are riddled with programs and policies promoted by various interest groups that \u201ccan increase the income [of the groups\u2019 members] while reducing society\u2019s.\u201d If he were alive today, Olson might well add that higher psychic income \u2014 the feeling of \u201cdoing good\u201d \u2014 also motivates many interest groups.\n\nIt may be even worse than Samuelson thinks. The burden of regulation may have so reduced economic growth over the past 7 decades that Americans are 75 percent poorer than they would otherwise have been, according to economists John Dawson of Appalachian State University and John Seater of North Carolina State.\n\nFor a somewhat more hopeful analysis see my article, \"Is U.S. Economic Growth OVer?\"", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "Crony Capitalism and regulation slowing down productivity and wage growth", "title": "Crony Capitalists and Special Interests Dragging Down U.S. Economic Growth", "url": "http://reason.com/blog/2015/09/14/crony-capitalists-and-special-interests", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14422403741496.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14422403741496.jpg", "description": "Crony Capitalism and regulation slowing down productivity and wage growth", "site": "@reason", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Crony Capitalists and Special Interests Dragging Down U.S. Economic Growth"}, "fb": {"pages": 17548474116}, "article": {"tag": "Public Choice", "published_time": "2015-09-14T14:33:00+00:00", "author": "http://reason.com/people/ronald-bailey"}, "msvalidate.01": "212A68A07785B3080038A845C4EE8905", "google-site-verification": "-AmMiilAN-pnjWt369CUWae-VQ-b9wmH4fSGyhbkQxw", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fddf84\"", "article_summary": "But consumers \u2014 who pay the higher prices \u2014 don\u2019t create a counter-lobby, because it\u2019s too much trouble and the higher prices are diluted among many individual consumers.\nThe growing burden of regulation could some day even turn economic growth negative.\nFor a somewhat more hopeful analysis see my article, \"Is U.S. Economic Growth OVer?\"\nSamuelson notes that wage increases have histroically tracked increases in economic productivity.\nBut if governments cater too aggressively to interest groups, they may undermine (or have already done so) the gains in productivity and economic growth that voters also expect."}
