(AP) - \u201cThe Manor?\u201d asks Portia Kane, who returns home to Haddon Township after a long absence as the protagonist in Matthew Quick\u2019s latest novel, \u201cLove May Fail.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know, that bar in Oaklyn. Near the school?\u201d answers Danielle Bass, Portia\u2019s high school friend.\n\n\u201cThe place with the deck, with the train tracks behind it? Next to the trestle?\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s the place. And when Portia tells Danielle she hasn\u2019t been there in years, Danielle\u2019s reply is one many patrons would echo:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s exactly how you remember it. The place never changes, which is the beauty of it, right? It\u2019s a constant.\u201d\n\nQuick, author of \u201cSilver Linings Playbook\u201d and an Oaklyn native, clearly believes in those constants, the familiar places he remembers fondly from his days living, teaching and writing in South Jersey.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a beloved place for me,\u201d said Quick in a phone interview with the Courier-Post from his home on North Carolina\u2019s Outer Banks. \u201cI grew up right around the corner. When I go there now, it\u2019s just \u2026 home.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s one of those places that I truly love.\u201d\n\nIndeed, for a 2011 Courier-Post story about friendship, Quick and his buddy Bill Rhoda were photographed at the bar.\n\nQuick will make an appearance at the Free Library of Philadelphia\u2019s Central Branch Wednesday launch \u201cLove May Fail,\u201d set largely in South Jersey, with key scenes at Oaklyn Manor. Among the other local settings: Haddon Township and Collingswood high schools, the Ocean City boardwalk, rowhomes on Cuthbert Boulevard and the Crystal Lake Diner.\n\nIn \u201cLove May Fail,\u201d one character, Chuck Bass, tends bar at the Manor; Danielle, his sister, is a waitress at the Crystal Lake Diner and frequently visits the bar.\n\nJack Farkas, the Manor\u2019s owner for the last six years and a bartender there since 1973, says Quick\u2019s observation the place hasn\u2019t changed much is true- \u201cFor a lot of years, you wouldn\u2019t even see women in the front part of the bar,\u201d he said to a female reporter as his daughter looked on -but agrees that consistency is a good thing (even if the lack of women wasn\u2019t.)\n\nFarkas, who tended bar part-time at the Manor for decades before buying it, calls his establishment \u201can old man bar\u201d with more than a trace of pride.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a corner bar, and there aren\u2019t a lot of corner bars left around here,\u201d he told the Courier-Post of Cherry Hill (http://on.cpsj.com/1QtFGE2 ).\n\nHis daughter Tracey- who\u2019s definitely not old, at 24 -says she grew up at the Manor and was happy to hear Quick, who also mentioned the bar in \u201cSilver Linings Playbook,\u201d came back in writing to the place he once frequented.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really cool; I\u2019d never think a bar in a small town would be in a book,\u201d said Tracey, a waitress at the bar for the last five years.\n\nBut the Manor does have a claim to fame, and not an insignificant one, either: Patrons once saved the world.\n\nOr so the Weekly World News claimed.\n\nThe crowd at the Manor diverted doomsday Sept. 27, 1991, Trueman Helms of Collingswood, a regular who took part in that day\u2019s epic effort, told the Courier-Post in 2011.\n\nThe people at Oaklyn Manor already saved the world once, twenty years ago. What are their thoughts, can they do it again? Do they even need to?\n\nAccording to the supermarket tab, 1.3 million people in China were going to jump in unison, knocking the Earth from its orbit. \u201cWe had to counterbalance it, so we did,\u201d said Helms in 2011, describing how about 20 patrons and staffers staged their own hop to keep the world on its axis.\n\nA framed story clipped from the now-defunct tabloid proclaims: \u201cNew Jersey jumpers stomp Commie plot to kill us all.\u201d\n\nThe Manor dates to 1933, right after Prohibition ended, according to Tim O\u2019Malley, who\u2019s tended bar there for 24 years and helped stage the world-saving jump.\n\nHe, too, liked the idea of the bar being immortalized in literature: \u201cIt\u2019s kind of a big deal,\u201d he said. \u201cIt brings us a little bit of civic pride.\u201d\n\nThe bar\u2019s character has remained the same in his time here, he said: \u201cIt\u2019s a little off the beaten track, but it\u2019s a really nice little spot.\u201d\n\nJack Farkas credits its family atmosphere: Parents can bring their children to the dining room or deck for dinner, and patrons and employees look out for one another, as the characters in Quick\u2019s book do.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll have some kids come in here after school sometimes, and they\u2019ll get a pitcher of soda and eat something,\u201d he said. \u201cWe just have a rule that you can\u2019t have kids in here after 10 (p.m.)\u201d\n\nThat family feeling carries across generations, and not just for Jack and Tracey Farkas: \u201cI remember Matt (Quick) coming in here; my daughter talked to him a lot,\u201d Jack said.\n\n\u201cAnd I used to wait on Matt\u2019s dad when he would come in here.\u201d\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Courier-Post (Cherry Hill, N.J.), http://www.courierpostonline.com/", "article_metadata": {"description": "\"The Manor?\" asks Portia Kane, who returns home to Haddon Township after a long absence as the protagonist in Matthew Quick's latest novel, \"Love May Fail.\"", "Author": "PHAEDRA TRETHAN", "og": {"url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jun/14/silver-linings-playbook-authors-new-book-mentions-/", "type": "article", "site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "\u201cThe Manor?\u201d asks Portia Kane, who returns home to Haddon Township after a long absence as the protagonist in Matthew Quick\u2019s latest novel, \u201cLove May Fail.\u201d", "title": "\u2018Silver Linings Playbook\u2019 author\u2019s new book mentions NJ bar"}, "twitter": {"title": "\u2018Silver Linings Playbook\u2019 author\u2019s new book mentions", "description": "\"The Manor?\" asks Portia Kane, who returns home to Haddon Township after a long absence as the protagonist in Matthew Quick's latest novel, \"Love May Fail.\"", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d"}, "article_summary": "The people at Oaklyn Manor already saved the world once, twenty years ago.\n\u201cAnd I used to wait on Matt\u2019s dad when he would come in here.\u201d___Information from: Courier-Post (Cherry Hill, N.J.), http://www.courierpostonline.com/\n\u201cIt\u2019s really cool; I\u2019d never think a bar in a small town would be in a book,\u201d said Tracey, a waitress at the bar for the last five years.\nHe, too, liked the idea of the bar being immortalized in literature: \u201cIt\u2019s kind of a big deal,\u201d he said.\nQuick will make an appearance at the Free Library of Philadelphia\u2019s Central Branch Wednesday launch \u201cLove May Fail,\u201d set largely in South Jersey, with key scenes at Oaklyn Manor."}
