Ted Cruz, the Texas Tea Partier carrying the banner for defunding the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.\n\nSarah Palin wrote an op-ed for Breitbart in which she claimed that if Cruz is unsuccessful in his fight against Obamacare it will be failure on the part of the GOP \u201cbecause there weren\u2019t enough principled leaders to stand with him.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time for the Senate to put itself on Cruz Control,\u201d she wrote.\n\n\u201cFor the last couple of years we\u2019ve had this wing of the party running roughshod over the rest of the party\u201d and promising to \u201cpurge the moderates\u201d from the GOP, Schmidt said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve lost five U.S. Senate seats over the last two election cycles,\u201d he continued. \u201cWe need Republicans, whether they\u2019re running for president, whether they\u2019re the leadership of the Congress, to stand up against a lot of this asininity.\u201d\n\nHe said Cruz might have finally gone \u201ca bridge too far.\u201d\n\n\u201cWise people understand the political consequences for the Republican party,\u201d he said of the impending government shut-down and default.\n\n\u201cMaybe we\u2019ll start seeing our elected leaders to stop being intimidated by this nonsense, have the nerve, have the guts to stand up \u2026 to fight to take conservatism\u2019s good name back from the freakshow that\u2019s been running wild for four years.\"\n\nMatthews reminded Schmidt that he is in part responsible for bring this \u201cFrankenstein\u2019s monster\u201d onto the political stage by tapping her as the vice presidential candidate.\n\n\u201cI have deep regret in my part, certainly, for initiating\u201d Palin\u2019s national platform, he said.\n\nPalin said Cruz and Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, are following through with their campaign promises by fighting to defund Obamacare.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d like to believe that the GOP establishment would applaud the way these bold leaders have rallied the grassroots to their cause,\u201d she wrote. \u201cBut, no, such praise would require a commensurate level of guts and leadership, and the permanent political class in D.C. is nothing if not gutless and rudderless.\u201d\n\nShe added that GOP senators up for re-election should think twice about voting down the measure.\n\n\u201cOh, and a little reminder to Republican senators up for re-election in 2014: Moose season ends soon, allowing more time on one\u2019s hands. So, we\u2019ll be watching your votes very carefully this week.\u201d\n\nSources: Mediaite, Breitbart", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#0e0e0e", "p": {"domain_verify": "4e3a17d2b19ae614286124438d4e37ce"}, "description": "Former John McCain strategist Steve Schmidt criticized former running mate Sarah Palin for throwing her hat in...", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "title": "McCain\u2019s Former Strategist Blasts Sarah Palin For Supporting Tea Party \u201cFreakshow\u201d In Defunding Obamacare", "modernizr-version": "2.8.3", "foundation-version": "5.4.7", "jquery-version": "2.1.1", "og": {"url": "http://www.opposingviews.com/i/politics/mccain-s-former-strategist-blasts-sarah-palin-supporting-tea-party-freakshow-defunding", "image": "http://www.opposingviews.com/", "type": "article", "description": "Former John McCain strategist Steve Schmidt criticized former running mate Sarah Palin for throwing her hat in...", "title": "McCain\u2019s Former Strategist Blasts Sarah Palin For Supporting Tea Party \u201cFreakshow\u201d In Defunding Obamacare"}, "DC.date.issued": "2013-09-24T15:16:52+00:00", "theme-version": "1.2.4", "publish_date": "2013-09-24T15:16:52+00:00", "msapplication-TileImage": "/sites/all/themes/ov_foundation/img/favicons/ms-icon-144x144.png", "theme-color": "#0e0e0e", "ov": {"id": 772714}, "viewport": "width=device-width, maximum-scale = 1.0"}, "article_summary": "Former John McCain strategist Steve Schmidt criticized former running mate Sarah Palin for throwing her hat into the \"defund Obamacare\" campaign.\n\u201cFor the last couple of years we\u2019ve had this wing of the party running roughshod over the rest of the party\u201d and promising to \u201cpurge the moderates\u201d from the GOP, Schmidt said.\nPalin said Cruz and Sen.
