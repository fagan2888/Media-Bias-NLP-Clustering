Children could also get their photographs taken with Santa, played by Flint resident Lowell Scowden.\n\nScowden said he often donates his time to dress up as Santa and the Easter bunny at fundraisers.\n\n\"You can't ever do enough for the kids,\" Scowden said.\n\nJon Youmans , of Flint, attended the event and said organizations such as the Old Newsboys of Flint are vital to the area's young people.\n\n\"There are so many kids out there that just don't have the support that they need,\" he said.\n\nTrimm said she plans to organize a similar, but larger, event next year to help supplement other fundraisers the Old Newsboys organize themselves.\n\n\n\n\n\nSherman's Lounge on Fenton Road also hosted a fundraiser, entitled \"The Belles of Christmas Jingle Ball,\" Sunday afternoon to benefit Old Newsboys.\n\n\n\nBands including Still Rain, Crush, Banshee and Daniel Vitany and Ten Hands Tall performed live at the fundraiser. Multiple 50/50 raffles, live and silent auctions, Chinese auctions and Santa and clowns for the children were all part of the event. Sherman's Lounge also donated half of all food sales to the cause.\n\n\n\nOld Newsboys also organize their own fundraisers, such as the newspaper sale which is their largest annual fundraiser that just took place Dec. 13.\n\n\n\nAt the fundraiser, more than 100 volunteers asked businesses and motorists for donations to fund the Christmas Box Program, which they hope will reach 7,000 children in low-income families this year, Flint Journal records show.\n\n\n\nFor more information, visit the Old Newsboys of Flint's website at onbflint.org.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "Description": "About 80 people gathered at Corunna Road Bar for an Old Newsboys of Flint fundraiser Christmas party Sunday, Dec. 15.", "title": "Corunna Road Bar and Sherman's Lounge host fundraisers in Flint area to benefit Old Newsboys", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Corunna Road Bar and Sherman\\u0027s Lounge host fundraisers in Flint area to benefit Old Newsboys\", \"link\": \"http://www.mlive.com/news/flint/index.ssf/2013/12/corunna_road_bar_in_flint_host.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://imgick.mlive.com/home/mlive-media/width620/img/newsnow_impact/photo/13945574-standard.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"11832424\", \"pub_date\": \"2013-12-16T01:35:27Z\", \"author\": \"Molly Young | myoung7@mlive.com\", \"tags\": [\"@fl-river\"] }", "twitter": {"image": "http://media.mlive.com/newsnow_impact/photo/13945574-thumb_square_large.jpg", "description": "About 80 people gathered at Corunna Road Bar for an Old Newsboys of Flint fundraiser Christmas party Sunday, Dec. 15.", "card": "summary", "site": "@mlive"}, "article_date_updated": "Sunday, December 15, 2013,  8:36 PM", "parsely-metadata": "{\"image_url\": \"http://media.mlive.com/newsnow_impact/photo/old-newsboys2jpg-eb68f8831686c27d.jpg\", \"author_name\": \"MYOUNG7\", \"author_nickname\": \"Molly Young | myoung7@mlive.com\", \"author_id\": \"11175792\", \"source_blog_name\": \"Flint News\", \"source_blog_url\": \"http://www.mlive.com/news/flint/index.ssf/\", \"sponsored_content\": \"0\" }", "og": {"site_name": "MLive.com", "description": "About 80 people gathered at Corunna Road Bar for an Old Newsboys of Flint fundraiser Christmas party Sunday, Dec. 15.", "title": "Corunna Road Bar and Sherman's Lounge host fundraisers in Flint area to benefit Old Newsboys", "url": "http://www.mlive.com/news/flint/index.ssf/2013/12/corunna_road_bar_in_flint_host.html", "image": "http://media.mlive.com/design/alpha/img/logo_mlive.gif", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "MLive.com", "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Sunday, December 15, 2013,  8:30 PM", "article_author": "Molly Young | myoung7@mlive.com"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca977\"", "article_summary": "FLINT TOWNSHIP, MI \u2013 About 80 people gathered at Corunna Road Bar for an Old Newsboys of Flint fundraiser Christmas party Sunday, Dec. 15.\nThe event was inspired by Barb Young, a Corunna Road Bar employee who'd done penny drives in past years for Old Newsboys.\nSherman's Lounge on Fenton Road also hosted a fundraiser, entitled \"The Belles of Christmas Jingle Ball,\" Sunday afternoon to benefit Old Newsboys.\nFor more information, visit the Old Newsboys of Flint's website at onbflint.org.\nJon Youmans , of Flint, attended the event and said organizations such as the Old Newsboys of Flint are vital to the area's young people."}
