PROVIDED\n\nJim Cornette has always been one of my favorite people in the wrestling business. And believe me, that covers a lot of ground.\n\nMaybe it\u2019s because he\u2019s an exceptional talent whose decades in the profession are a testament to his many skills and durability. It could also be because he\u2019s one of the funniest guys around who never fails to make those around him laugh. Or perhaps it\u2019s just the fact that Jim Cornette is a hardcore, diehard fan of professional wrestling and, most importantly, its storied history.\n\nAll of those reasons make Cornette\u2019s new book, which he co-authored with Tennessee wrestling historian Mark James, a highly enjoyable read. \u201cTuesday Night at the Gardens\u201d is a history of wrestling in Louisville \u2014 from the debut of Ed \u201cStrangler\u201d Lewis to the rise of Jerry \u201cThe King\u201d Lawler.\n\nMore than 100 illustrations \u2014 rare photos, programs and newspaper clippings \u2014 adorn the nearly 300-page volume.\n\nThe book is full of gems, including an inside look at the Nashville-based booking office run by Nick Gulas and Roy Welch, the expansion of the Memphis territory by Jerry Jarrett, and the complete 100-year history of the Louisville Gardens arena.\n\nTo make the package even more appealing, each book comes personally autographed by Cornette, with custom inscriptions available at no extra charge, along with a two-hour souvenir DVD featuring the only match films from the Louisville Gardens from 1970-75 still in existence. Included is the infamous 1971 first-ever scaffold match between Jerry Jarrett and Don Greene.\n\nFor more information or to order the book, visit jimcornette.com.\n\nThe two-year project has been a labor of love for both James and Cornette, who found national acclaim back in the \u201880s as a loud-mouthed, tennis racket-wielding heel manager for The Midnight Express and later for being a highly regarded creative voice in the business.\n\n\u201cFor years Jimmy and I talked about doing books together, but his crazy schedules with TNA and the ROH prevented that,\u201d says James, who has written a number of books dedicated to preserving the history of Memphis wrestling. \u201cAbout three years ago I was trying to put out a trade paperback collection of a Memphis wrestling magazine he originally released in the early 1980s. Well, after Jim quit ROH, that book morphed almost overnight into \u201cRags, Paper & Pens,\u2019\u201d a book that looked back at the origins of pro wrestling\u2019s gimmick tables and merchandising in the Tennessee territories of the \u201860s and \u201870s, during the days before merchandising was a multimillion-dollar business.\n\nFrom there, says James, the two stepped back and looked at a future project. The obvious choices were two places closest to Cornette\u2019s heart \u2014 Louisville and Smoky Mountain Wrestling.\n\n\u201cWe decided to go with Louisville first,\u201d says James. \u201cWe then worked two years on \u2018Tuesday Night at the Gardens.\u2019\u201d\n\nEventually, he says, the two plan to release two Louisville books and two SMW books.\n\n\u201cThe great thing is Jimmy\u2019s meticulous record-keeping,\u201d adds James. \u201cWith the Louisville book as an example, he referred to his notes, and 40-plus years after the fact expounded upon them. His descriptions take the reader back to the early 1970s in the Louisville Garden.\n\n\u201cAnother advantage we have with these books is Jimmy collected everything wrestling-related back in the day. Now his amazing collection, which resides at \u2018Castle Cornette\u2019 in Louisville (packed with wrestling memorabilia going all the way back to the 1930s), pays dividends more and more with every book we put together. We both believe that when you do a book on pro wrestling, the words are great, but when you can add photos, programs, etc., it helps the reader be transformed back to those matches.\u201d\n\nThe book is written from a fan and a performer\u2019s perspective. Cornette spent a good portion of his teenage years at the Louisville Garden, where he eventually graduated from a weekly third-row seat taking photos from a Kodak Instamatic, to the front row where he used a new and more versatile 35mm Canon. Many of his early shots are included in the book.\n\n\u201cUnknowingly to me, I was practicing for a career, both in photography and wrestling,\u201d says Cornette. \u201cAnd \u2014 in watching the talent and their moves so carefully to frame shots \u2014 later as a performer myself.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen people tell me I\u2019m the biggest Memphis wrestling fan, I quickly correct them and tell then Jim Cornette is the biggest Memphis wrestling fan I know,\u201d says James. \u201cTo be completely honest, Jim Cornette is the biggest old school wrestling fan I have ever known.\u201d\n\nWhile the book revolves around the Louisville Garden, the scope is actually much larger, explains James.\n\n\u201cWhen you say Memphis Wrestling, it really encompasses the entire promotion (Memphis Louisville, Evansville, etc).\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s also, of course, a personal look at the Gardens itself, which until 1975 was called The Armory, shedding any high-tech, corporate logo that might have diminished its image.\n\n\u201cIt scoffs at today\u2019s mollycoddling arenas with their well-appointed seats, luxury boxes, gourmet coffee and microbrew stands. It knew its beer was always a tad flat, the soft drinks too syrupy, the popcorn spongy and pretzels a hazard to oncoming molars. It made no apologies,\u201d it was once written in the Louisville Courier-Journal.\n\nOne of my favorite sidebars in the book is the amazing story of \u201cRoughhouse\u201d Fargo, also known as \u201cNuthouse\u201d Fargo, Jackie Fargo\u2019s older brother. As the maniacal Roughhouse Fargo, the unorthodox grappler was one of the biggest box office attractions in the Tennessee territory.\n\nLabeled the black sheep of the family and \u201cnot right in the head,\u201d Fargo would be used on special occasions after reportedly being checked out of a state mental hospital, wreaking havoc on the Fargos\u2019 opponents in spite of his wiry, bony 190-pound frame. As Sonny Fargo in the Jim Crockett-run Carolinas territory, however, he was known as a mild-mannered, low-key referee and sometimes prelim wrestler who was the polar opposite of his wildman character in Tennessee.\n\n\u201cThe legend of Roughhouse Fargo was timeless,\u201d writes Cornette.\n\nLike the introduction says, the book is a return to those thrilling days of yesteryear, when fans religiously watched the weekly TV matches that whet their appetites for weekly or monthly live shows at their hometown arenas.\n\n\u201cThey came by the hundreds of thousands,\u201d write the authors, \u201cto experience a unique American art form live and in person ... They came in the rain, the snow and the storms.\u201d\n\nThose days of true believers and weekly hometown shows, though, are long gone.\n\nBut there is a lot to be learned from this book by old school and current fans.\n\n\u201cOld school fans are going to be shocked at just how much of the pro wrestling they grew up watching was, indeed, contrived, manipulated or, as it\u2019s called in the business, \u2018worked,\u2019 says Cornette. \u201cCurrent fans are going to be absolutely gobsmacked at just how little it was.\u201d\n\nScientific classics, epic blood feuds, there\u2019s a little bit of everything in this fun journey back in time to an era in wrestling that no longer exists.\n\nBut as long as passionate historians like Cornette and James are around, those memories will never die.\n\nReach Mike Mooneyham at 843-937-5517 or mooneyham@postandcourier.com, or follow him on Twitter at @ByMike Mooneyham and on Facebook at Facebook.com/MikeMooneyham.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Cornette, James team up for book on Louisville wrestling, Mike Mooneyham, \r\nMike MooneyhamSports, \r\nFP LatestNews, \r\nFP LatestNews, Jim Cornette,Mark James,Mooneyham Column,Pro wrestling,Tuesday Night at The Gardens", "og": {"site_name": "Post and Courier", "description": "Jim Cornette has always been one of my favorite people in the wrestling business.
