Last week, we got a clue: For Cruz, \u201cNew York\u201d is another way of saying \u201cJewish.\u201d At an event in New Hampshire, Cruz, the Republican Iowa caucus winner, was asked about campaign money he and his wife borrowed from Goldman Sachs. Cruz, asserting that Trump had \u201cupward of $480 million of loans from giant Wall Street banks,\u201d said: \u201cFor him to make this attack, to use a New York term, it's the height of chutzpah.\u201d Cruz, pausing for laughter after the phrase \u201cNew York term,\u201d exaggerated the guttural \u201cch\u201d to more laughter and applause. But chutzpah, of course, is not a \u201cNew York\u201d term. It's a Yiddish \u2014 a Jewish \u2014 one. And using \u201cNew York\u201d as a euphemism for Jewish has long been an anti-Semitic dog-whistle. I followed both Cruz and Trump this past week at multiple campaign events across New Hampshire. It was, in a sense, a pleasure to see them use their prodigious skills of character assassination against each other. It was demagogue against demagogue: lie vs. lie. Both men riled their supporters with fantasies and straw men. But there were discernible differences. Trump owned anger. Cruz, by contrast, had a lock on nastiness. Trump is belligerent and hyperbolic, with an authoritarian style. But while Trump fires up the masses with his nonstop epithets, Cruz has Joe McCarthy's knack for false insinuation and underhandedness. What sets Cruz apart is the malice he exudes. Cruz jokes that \u201cthe whole point of the campaign\u201d is that \u201cthe Washington elites despise\u201d him. But Cruz's problem is that going back to his college days at Princeton, those who know him best seem to despise him most. Not a single Senate colleague has endorsed his candidacy, and Iowa's Republican governor urged Cruz's defeat, then called his campaign \u201cunethical.\u201d Ben Carson, who rarely has a bad word to say about anybody in the GOP race, accused Cruz of \u201cdeceit and dirty tricks and lies\u201d last week after the Texan's campaign spread the false rumor during the Iowa caucuses that Carson was quitting the race. Two former rivals who also appeal to religious conservatives, Mike Huckabee and Rick Santorum (who endorsed Marco Rubio), have questioned Cruz's truthfulness, too. Sarah Palin, whose support for Cruz in 2012 got him elected to the Senate, last week denounced him after a Cruz surrogate accused her of accepting payment from Trump to back him. She, too, accused Cruz's campaign of \u201clies,\u201d a \u201cdirty trick\u201d and \u201ctypical Washington tactics.\u201d Cruz, in Nashua, slashed back at his one-time benefactor: \u201cIt seems if you spend too much time with Donald Trump strange things happen to people.\u201d Somebody in the crowd shouted \u201cFire Palin!\u201d and the audience cheered. Iowa's secretary of state, a Republican, issued a statement before the caucuses accusing Cruz's campaign of \u201cfalse representation\u201d because of a mailing to voters charging them with a \u201cvoting violation\u201d and assigning them and their neighbors' phony grades. After Cruz's caucus-night skullduggery \u2014 a campaign email to supporters and a tweet by a Cruz national co-chairman suggesting Carson was quitting the race \u2014 his response continued the deception. Though he apologized to Carson, he said that \u201cour political team forwarded a news story from CNN\u201d and \u201call the rest of it is just silly noise.\u201d But CNN said nothing about Carson dropping out. After Trump, in his overblown way, accused Cruz of stealing the election, Cruz replied, righteously, that \u201cI have no intention of insulting him or throwing mud.\u201d No? He accused Trump of \u201ca Trumpertantrum.\u201d He said Trump as president \u201cwould have nuked Denmark.\u201d He said Trump \u201cdoesn't have any core beliefs.\u201d He mischaracterized several of Trump's positions, saying \u201che wants to expand Obamacare,\u201d that \u201cfor his entire life, 60 years, he has been advocating for full-on socialized medicine\u201d and that Trump favors \u201camnesty\u201d for illegal immigrants and \u201cwants to deport people that are here illegally but then let them back in immediately and become citizens.\u201d He speculated that Trump may have \u201cbillions\u201d in loans and said the concept of repaying loans is \u201cnovel and unfamiliar to Donald.\u201d The misrepresentation isn't limited to Trump. In a single speech in Nashua, he mischaracterized things said by, among others, Jimmy Carter, Chris Wallace, guests on Sean Hannity's show, Atlanta's mayor, Rubio and, of course, President Obama. I asked the Cruz campaign for substantiation of several of Cruz's accusations but received nothing. Unsurprising: Cruz's purpose is not to inform but to insinuate.
