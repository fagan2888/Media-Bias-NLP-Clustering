The hospital conducts audits on normally unsuspecting housekeepers to check their work. Glo Gel is applied to high-touch areas, like bed rails and door knobs, beforehand, and housekeepers are tested to see if they wipe away those applied areas exposed by the black light.

During 2011 and 2012, there was a 9 percent decrease in hospital-acquired conditions across the U.S., with reductions in such episodes as falls, adverse drug events and infections, preventing nearly 15,000 deaths in hospitals and avoiding 560,000 patient injuries, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nChun says the HAC program penalizes hospitals on a curve, so it can wind up docking some that have made dramatic improvements.\n\n\"No matter what the circumstances, no matter what your condition, if you are in the 25th percentile, you are going to get a penalty,\" he said.\n\nChuck Bohlmann, Iroquois Memorial's CEO since January 2013, said that hospital has been focusing on quality and improvement, and he couldn't explain how it stood in line to be penalized.\n\nPresence Health, which has recently begun managing this hospital under contract, says for all of 2012, 2013 and this year to date, there haven't been any central line-associated bloodstream infections there, and for that same period, there has been just one catheter-associated urinary tract infection that occurred this year.\n\n\"I wish I could comment more firmly on the data, but without being able to look at it, and with it being very preliminary, it's difficult to react to it to much,\" Bohlmann said.\n\nLosing 1 percent of inpatient Medicare payments for a year would amount to $233,000 for Sarah Bush Lincoln Health Center, says Craig Sheagren, its chief financial officer.\n\n\"We were pretty disappointed to see that happened, obviously,\" he said of the hospital's score, adding it was based on older data.\n\n\"We've made significant improvements since that point,\" he said.\n\nCarle's Quality Services Manager, Jamie Holley, says Carle also has made significant progress on patient safety indictors.\n\nShe lists several patient safety initiatives Carle has undertaken \u2014 among them a \"zero defect\" campaign striving for zero complications \u2014 and work with a collaborative in which hospitals seek to improve by sharing data and comparing their quality of care performance.\n\n\"This is based off older data. We've made significant improvements since then,\" she said. \"I'd feel very comfortable coming here (to Carle) to receive care, and I'd recommend it to other patients as well.\"\n\nFacing possible sanctions\n\nThese hospitals are in line to lose 1 percent of their Medicare payments for a year, because they are among the 25 percent of the nation's hospitals with higher rates of complications and infections, according to preliminary government data. Hospitals were scored from 1-10, with 10 being the worst. Their positions could change when they're re-evaluated later this year with a longer period of data.\n\nIroquois Memorial Hospital, Watseka: 9\n\nUniversity of Illinois Hospital, Chicago: 8.7\n\nCarle Foundation Hospital, Urbana: 8.65\n\nAdvocate Bromenn Medical Center, Normal: 8.35\n\nSarah Bush Lincoln Health Center, Mattoon: 8\n\nSee all Illinois hospitals' scores here.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Champaign,Urbana,Danville,Paxton,Rantoul,Mahomet,Monticello,Tuscola,East Central Illinois,University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign,News", "og": {"url": "http://www.news-gazette.com/news/local/2014-06-27/infections-may-cost-area-hospitals-medicare-payments.html", "image": "/sites/all/files/images/2014/06/26/THUMB_hospitals.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "A handful of area hospitals are in line to lose a chunk of their Medicare payments starting in October, a penalty they might have to pay for having too many avoidable complications and infections.", "title": "Infections may cost area hospitals Medicare payments"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2015 The News-Gazette, Inc.", "description": "URBANA \u2014 A handful of area hospitals are in line to lose a chunk of their Medicare payments starting in October, a penalty they might have to pay for having too many avoidable complications and infections."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd923\"", "article_summary": "\u2014 Controlling the urinary tract infections associated with catheters, infections that currently tie with pneumonia as the second most common type of hospital-associated infection.\nOther Related Content Preliminary hospital scoresURBANA \u2014 A handful of area hospitals are in line to lose a chunk of their Medicare payments starting in October, a penalty they might have to pay for having too many avoidable complications and infections.\nHospitals are being evaluated in the following three areas:\u2014 Controlling the serious infections that enter the bloodstream through a central line, or catheter.\nFacing possible sanctionsThese hospitals are in line to lose 1 percent of their Medicare payments for a year, because they are among the 25 percent of the nation's hospitals with higher rates of complications and infections, according to preliminary government data.\nChun says the HAC program penalizes hospitals on a curve, so it can wind up docking some that have made dramatic improvements."}
