Cory Booker (D-N.J.) is calling for a reinstatement of the Superfund tax that helps pay for the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to clean up contaminated sites, saying it would bring back a fair system in which polluters pay for cleanups.\n\nThe tax paid for \u201corphaned\u201d sites, in which the company responsible for the contamination has gone bankrupt or otherwise cannot pay the costs. It expired in 1995, and since then, EPA has relied on appropriated funds for the program.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAt a Tuesday hearing on the Superfund program hosted by the Environment and Public Works Committee\u2019s oversight subcommittee, Booker said he and Sen. Bob Menendez (D-N.J.) will sponsor legislation to reintroduce the tax placed on oil, gas and other chemical companies. Booker is chairman of the panel.\n\n\u201cThis bill will reinstate the excise tax on polluting industries, as approved by President Reagan, in order to provide funding for Superfund cleanup,\u201d said Booker.\n\nThe tax\u2019s expiration is only part of the Superfund program\u2019s financial problems, he said. Its appropriated budgets in 2013 and 2014 were the lowest in 25 years.\u201d \u201cNationwide, there are hundreds of Superfund sites that on the national priority list where remediation has not even begun,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd there are hundreds more sites on the list where remediation is ongoing, but too often the pace is slowed by inefficient funding problems.\u201d\n\nIn addition to the legislation, Booker said he and Sen.
