Todd Young, R-Ind. (Photo: J. Scott Applewhite/AP 2013 file photo)\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The U.S. Chamber of Commerce is jumping into the Republican primary for Indiana's Senate seat, backing Rep. Todd Young over Rep. Marlin Stutzman.\n\nThe business group is starting an ad campaign praising Young that will run through the May 3 primary. Local and national Chamber officials will hold a news conference with the Bloomington Republican on Wednesday.\n\nThe Chamber\u2019s new ad marks the group\u2019s first involvement in a Senate primary this year, signifying the importance of the race.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. Chamber of Commerce is all in for Todd Young,\u201d spokeswoman Erica Flint said in an email. She said the ad is part of the Chamber\u2019s push to provide early support for \u201ceffective, pro-growth conservatives who are laser-focused on governing.\u201d\n\nNathan Gonzales, editor and publisher of The Rothenberg & Gonzales Political Report, a nonpartisan newsletter that tracks congressional races, said the Chamber\u2019s involvement is significant because the group is boosting the candidate \u2014 Young \u2014 who already has the financial advantage.\n\n\u201cThe lack of support for Stutzman so far has also been telling,\u201d Gonzales said. Although the conservative Club for Growth endorsed Stutzman early, the group has yet to run ads on his behalf, he noted.\n\nThe Chamber\u2019s involvement is also an example of how the race is increasingly a battle between traditional elements of the GOP establishment, including the business community, and outside groups such as the Club for Growth that have been challenging the establishment.\n\n\u201cRight now, Indiana is the Senate race where the clear battle lines have been drawn,\u201d Gonzales said.\n\nThat was the same dynamic in Indiana\u2019s last competitive Senate primary, when Sen. Richard Lugar was defeated in 2012. Lugar\u2019s backers included the Chamber of Commerce, while he was opposed by the Club for Growth and the tea party group FreedomWorks, which also has backed Stutzman.\n\nThe 2012 race was primarily a referendum on Lugar, who opponents argued was too moderate. This year\u2019s contest is less about conservative credentials and more about style.\n\nU.S. Rep. Marlin Stutzman, R-Ind. (Photo: Provided 2010 file photo)\n\nStutzman, R-Howe, says the establishment is trying to crush his campaign because he voted against John Boehner continuing as speaker of the House last year.\n\n\u201cThe establishment knows \u2026 that I don\u2019t 'fall in line\u2019 when it comes time to vote,\u201d Stutzman said in a fundraising email Monday.\n\nOn the 20 votes most important to the Chamber last year, Stutzman voted against the group\u2019s position seven times. Young did so four times.\n\nBoth voted against the Chamber on a temporary bill to keep the government funded, a two-year budget and debt ceiling agreement and the final version of the bill funding the government through September. They also opposed continuing the Export-Import Bank, which helps finance international sales by offering low-cost loans to foreign buyers or guarantees and credit insurance against potential losses.\n\nStutzman also voted against a rewrite of K-12 education policy, continuing assistance programs for workers displaced by trade and a cybersecurity bill to push companies to share computer network information with federal investigators to help thwart hackers.\n\nThe Chamber\u2019s new ad doesn\u2019t mention any of those issues.\n\nInstead, it calls Young a \u201crock-ribbed conservative\u201d who never backs down to President Barack Obama.\n\n\u201cTodd Young is leading the fight to dismantle the worst parts of Obamacare,\u201d the ad says in a reference to legislation Young authored to increase the number of hours someone must work before an employer has to offer health insurance under the Affordable Care Act. The bill passed the House last year but has not advanced in the Senate.\n\nThe ads are running on television and radio in the Indianapolis media market, as well as digitally statewide.\n\nStutzman estimates the Chamber is spending $500,000 on the ads. The Chamber spokeswoman declined to state the amount, which will be disclosed later to the Federal Election Commission.\n\nAn outside group with ties to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., last week launched ads praising Young\u2019s record on national security issues.\n\nEmail Maureen Groppe at mgroppe@gannett.com.
