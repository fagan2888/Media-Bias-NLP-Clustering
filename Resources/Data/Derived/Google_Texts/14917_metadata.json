Some of them fear the stringent requirements for doctors returning from West Africa could discourage them from going to fight the epidemic in the first place.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to make a difference in terms of cases of Ebola in the U.S.\u201d Dr. Art Reingold, University of California\n\n\u201cIf I lose three weeks on my return and don\u2019t get to do the work I\u2019m supposed to do, [it] means this wouldn\u2019t be workable for me,\u201d Tulane University immunologist Dr. John Carlson told CNN.\n\nNew York Gov. Andrew Cuomo and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie announced in a joint press conference on Friday that they would require all flight passengers arriving from Ebola-infected areas to submit to a mandatory, 21-day quarantine. The news came shortly after a doctor who had been treating Ebola victims in West Africa tested positive for the illness in New York. Another health care worker, Kaci Hickox, who had been in the region exhibited Ebola-like symptoms upon her return through Newark Liberty Airport, but tests came up negative.\n\n\u201cI have been clear that we will take whatever steps are necessary to protect the public health of the people of New Jersey which is exactly what these joint efforts with Governor Cuomo will do with additional screening and heightened standards for quarantine,\u201d Christie said in a joint statement with Cuomo. \u201cBy demanding these enhance measures, we are ensuring that any suspected cases are identified quickly and effectively, and that proper safeguards are executed.\u201d\n\nFederal authorities are reportedly considering instituting a similar policy nationwide. Many doctors would advise against it, however. Not only do they argue it would prevent otherwise ready and willing health care workers from fighting Ebola in West Africa; they\u2019re also skeptical a quarantine would have much of an upside beyond political optics.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s going to be an added benefit in terms of health,\u201d Dr. Art Reingold, head of epidemiology at the University of California\u2019s School of Public Health, told msnbc. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to make a difference in terms of cases of Ebola in the U.S.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, being locked up 21 days could have other consequences for those who experience quarantine. A University Toronto study of quarantined patients found the isolation can trigger depression and post-traumatic stress disorder.\n\nYet from a political vantage point, the quarantine may well be a victory for Cuomo and Christie. Certainly the New York Daily News is on their side: A Friday editorial from the paper praised the governors for acting to \u201cenhance public safety and calm fears.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "Public health experts fear a mandatory quarantine could discourage doctors who want to help Ebola victims in West Africa.", "original-source": "http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/doctors-question-ebola-quarantine-policy", "og": {"site_name": "MSNBC", "description": "Public health experts fear a mandatory quarantine could discourage doctors who want to help Ebola victims in West Africa.", "title": "Ebola quarantine policy sparks controversy in medical community", "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/doctors-question-ebola-quarantine-policy", "image": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--1_91-1--1200x630/public/h_00000219250093.jpg?itok=_amf03eV", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "msnbc.com", "account_id": 2836421, "creator": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/doctors-question-ebola-quarantine-policy", "image": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--3-2--512x342/public/article-teasers/457166068_1.jpg?itok=Opmm3yfP", "title": "Ebola quarantine policy sparks controversy in medical community", "site": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Public health experts fear a mandatory quarantine could discourage doctors who want to help Ebola victims in West Africa."}, "robots": "follow, index", "DC.date.issued": "2014-10-25T11:59:00-04:00", "jenga-session-config": "{\"when_to_init\":\"after_dom_ready\"}", "fb": {"app_id": 351594351545594}, "nv": {"author": "nedresnikoff", "tags": "ebola,global-health,health,new-jersey,new-york", "title": "Ebola quarantine policy sparks controversy in medical community", "published": 1, "date": "10/25/2014 11:59:00 EDT", "address": "http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/doctors-question-ebola-quarantine-policy"}, "article": {"author": "http://www.facebook.com/msnbc"}, "abstract": "Public health experts fear a mandatory quarantine could discourage doctors who want to help Ebola victims in West Africa.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Health, Global Health, Ebola, New Jersey, New York"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca138\"", "article_summary": "A mandatory 21-day quarantine for visitors from Ebola hot spots may be good politics, but public health experts aren\u2019t convinced it\u2019s good policy.\nYet from a political vantage point, the quarantine may well be a victory for Cuomo and Christie.\nThe news came shortly after a doctor who had been treating Ebola victims in West Africa tested positive for the illness in New York.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to make a difference in terms of cases of Ebola in the U.S.\u201dMeanwhile, being locked up 21 days could have other consequences for those who experience quarantine.\nSome of them fear the stringent requirements for doctors returning from West Africa could discourage them from going to fight the epidemic in the first place."}
