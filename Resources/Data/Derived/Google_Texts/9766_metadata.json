It would also repeal Obamacare\u2019s auto-enrollment mandate and prevent a hike in Medicare B premiums for senior citizens.\n\nThe proposal represents a meeting point between Democrats, who demanded a \"clean\" debt ceiling detached from a budget deal, and Republicans, who generally want deeper cuts and more extensive entitlement reform than this arrangement offers.\n\nPairing an unvarnished debt ceiling hike with a budget that includes proposed entitlement reforms could provide cover for Republicans to support raising the $18 trillion debt limit, which the government is set to hit next Tuesday, Nov. 3.\n\nBut conservatives -\u2013 who, like all members, want to review the details of the proposal when it is introduced in both chambers -\u2014still have their concerns.\n\n\"Those of us who are on the conservative side of the party probably flinched a little bit,\" Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., said after the Senate Republican meeting, citing concerns with how the proposal offsets new spending.\n\nHouse hardliners left their conference meeting simmering over how the potential deal was reached.\n\n\"You could count on the fingers of one hand how many people were involved in this negotiation,\" said Rep. John Fleming, R-Louisiana, a member of the House Freedom Caucus.\n\n\"We're not just here to take commands,\" said Rep. Justin Amash, R-Michigan, another member of the group.\n\nHouse Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, has said he wants to clear the legislative table for his successor.\n\n\"Cleaning out the barn,\" he told reporters as he walked into the briefing Monday night.\n\nHammering out a budget deal and debt ceiling hike would be quite the swan song for the Ohio Republican.\n\nWhile the move would keep Boehner\u2019s successor -\u2013 all but certain to be Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wisconsin \u2013- from presiding over a messy vote requiring Democratic support, it could also put unexpected pressure on Ryan to distance himself from Boehner\u2019s leadership.\n\n\"I hope Paul Ryan will let us know how he feels about the process,\" Amash said.\n\nThe Wisconsin Republican, who members say did not speak in the meeting Monday evening, left the briefing without taking questions from reporters.\n\n\"[Ryan is] in favor of regular order, he's in favor of the Hastert rule -\u2013 the majority of the majority -- if you had those two things, you wouldn\u2019t get this outcome,\" said Rep. Dave Brat, R-Virginia.", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Budget Deal Between Congress, White House Coming Into Focus", "description": "The latest on negotiations between Congress and the White House to fund the government and lift the debt ceiling.", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 ABC News Internet Ventures", "author": "ABC News", "og": {"site_name": "ABC News", "description": "The latest on negotiations between Congress and the White House to fund the government and lift the debt ceiling.", "title": "Budget Deal Between Congress, White House Coming Into Focus", "url": "http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/budget-deal-congress-white-house-coming-focus/story?id=34750676", "image": "http://a.abcnews.go.com/images/Politics/GTY_capitol_kab_141015_16x9_992.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The latest on negotiations between Congress and the White House to fund the government and lift the debt ceiling.", "creator": "@benyc", "url": "http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/budget-deal-congress-white-house-coming-focus/story?id=34750676", "image": "http://a.abcnews.go.com/images/Politics/GTY_capitol_kab_141015_4x3t_240.jpg", "title": "Budget Deal Between Congress, White House Coming Into Focus", "site": "@ABC", "app": {"url": {"ipad": "abcnewsipad://link/story,34750676", "iphone": "abcnewsiphone://link/story,34750676", "googleplay": "android-app://com.abc.abcnews/abcnews/abcnews.go.com/Politics/budget-deal-congress-white-house-coming-focus/story?id=34750676"}, "name": {"ipad": "ABC News", "iphone": "ABC News", "googleplay": "ABC News"}, "id": {"ipad": 306934135, "iphone": 300255638, "googleplay": "com.abc.abcnews"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "index, follow", "DC.date.issued": "2015-10-27", "al": {"ipad": {"url": "abcnewsipad://link/story,34750676", "app_store_id": 380520716, "app_name": "ABC News for iPad"}, "web": {"url": "http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/budget-deal-congress-white-house-coming-focus/story?id=34750676"}, "android": {"url": "android-app://com.abc.abcnews/abcnews/abcnews.go.com/Politics/budget-deal-congress-white-house-coming-focus/story?id=34750676", "app_name": "ABC News Breaking Latest News", "package": "com.abc.abcnews"}, "iphone": {"url": "abcnewsiphone://link/story,34750676", "app_store_id": 300255638, "app_name": "ABC News - Breaking US & World News"}}, "Last-Modified": "2015-10-27 06:53:15", "fb": {"admins": 704409894, "app_id": 4942312939}, "keywords": "Debt-limit, budget, Congress, Republicans, Democrats, White-House, politics news, election news, political news, political news articles", "Date": "2015-10-27", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Debt-limit, budget, Congress, Republicans, Democrats, White-House"}, "article_summary": "Hammering out a budget deal and debt ceiling hike would be quite the swan song for the Ohio Republican.\nCongressional leaders were confident enough in the broad outlines of a potential budget deal with the White House to update House and Senate members Monday night -\u2013 but some conservatives voiced concern over some of the details of the still-developing plan.\nHouse hardliners left their conference meeting simmering over how the potential deal was reached.\nThe proposal represents a meeting point between Democrats, who demanded a \"clean\" debt ceiling detached from a budget deal, and Republicans, who generally want deeper cuts and more extensive entitlement reform than this arrangement offers.\nHouse Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, has said he wants to clear the legislative table for his successor."}
