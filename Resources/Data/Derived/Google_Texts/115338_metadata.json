The experimental projects began with a mere 33 acres in 2014.\n\nThe momentum is continuing after a change in leadership at the Agriculture Department.\n\nThe rebirth of legal hemp production was championed by then-state Agriculture Commissioner James Comer. Comer ran for governor last year, losing in the Republican primary to Matt Bevin. But his successor as agriculture commissioner, Ryan Quarles, has assumed the role of advocating for hemp.\n\n\u201cHemp is a bridge from Kentucky\u2019s past to our future,\u201d said Quarles, a Republican. \u201cThe Kentucky Department of Agriculture and our partners are committed to building upon the solid foundation of research for a Kentucky hemp industry that will create jobs and new marketing opportunities.\u201d\n\nKentucky has been at the forefront nationally in efforts to return hemp to mainstream status.\n\nThe tiny experimental crop produced in 2014 was the first legal hemp crop in generations in Kentucky.\n\nGrowing hemp without a federal permit was banned in 1970 due to its classification as a controlled substance related to marijuana. Hemp and marijuana are the same species, Cannabis sativa, but hemp has a negligible amount of THC, the psychoactive compound that gives marijuana users a high.\n\nHemp got a limited reprieve with the federal farm bill, which allows state agriculture departments to designate hemp projects for research and development in states such as Kentucky that allow hemp growing.\n\nHemp is prized for its oils, seeds and fiber.\n\nThe crop, which once thrived in Kentucky, was historically used for rope but has many other uses, including clothing and mulch from the fiber; hemp milk and cooking oil from the seeds; and soap and lotions. Other uses include building materials, animal bedding and biofuels.\n\nIn Kentucky, the number of university-led hemp research projects had more than doubled since 2015, the state Agriculture Department said. The focus is expanding beyond production research to look into how the crop can be turned into consumer products.\n\nKDA said it is offering multi-year partnerships with processors to develop information on processing and marketing potential.\n\nQuarles also said his department is working to ensure that hemp producers can obtain seeds.\n\nKentucky farmer Michael Lewis said he\u2019s preparing for another year of hemp production to test its potential in textiles, health and nutrition products.\n\n\u201cThat shows the potential, that shows the interest, that shows the investment,\u201d he said of the plans for increased production in 2016. \u201cI think we\u2019re getting there. We still have a lot of processing hurdles to overcome. But that\u2019s the same with any new industry. I\u2019m feeling good about it.\u201d\n\nRead or Share this story: http://cjky.it/1RcUGRT", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Kentucky is accelerating hemp production in the third year of testing its potential as a cash crop.", "og": {"site_name": "The Courier-Journal", "description": "Kentucky is accelerating hemp production in the third year of testing its potential as a cash crop.", "title": "Kentucky ramps up hemp test production in 2016", "url": "http://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/local/2016/03/20/kentucky-ramps-up-hemp-test-production-2016/82047454/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/courier-journal.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Kentucky is accelerating hemp production in the third year of testing its potential as a cash crop.", "title": "Kentucky ramps up hemp test production in 2016", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/cc229a46ad8fb72fe9013b851140e17178196f19/c=682-0-3413-2731&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/Louisville/2014/06/26/514a2760x.jpg", "creator": "@courierjournal", "site": "@courierjournal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600030236", "fb": {"app_id": 128534137209813}, "viewport": "width=1070", "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Geography/Kentucky", "gci-asset-type": "story", "gci-categories": "Geography/Kentucky", "title": "Kentucky ramps up hemp test production in 2016", "author": "Bruce Schreiner", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "news/local", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/c39ccc096369030bccc33d59521226caf2715ba9/c=1024-0-3072-2731/local/-/media/Louisville/2014/06/26/514a2760x.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/c6398ea970651ffb0b29923b76a2a32d4b366754/c=682-0-3413-2731/local/-/media/Louisville/2014/06/26/514a2760x.jpg", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9fa9b2436e03438b0096ead78a97a4f16496995b/c=228-0-3869-2731/local/-/media/Louisville/2014/06/26/514a2760x.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/28acf19c2984726a08e521329f1448199c979072/c=0-214-4096-2518&r=x1683&c=3200x1680/local/-/media/Louisville/2014/06/26/514a2760x.jpg", "publishtime": "2016-03-20T12:48:06.390000-04:00", "shorthed": "Kentucky ramps up hemp test production in 2016", "articleid": 82047454, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/0bc1b0a376b99158d93d000777ed669a998bcb79/c=0-214-4096-2518/local/-/media/Louisville/2014/06/26/514a2760x.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/c0790a3454b838f4d67dffc360440d034a4640f4/c=1280-0-2816-2731/local/-/media/Louisville/2014/06/26/514a2760x.jpg"}}, "news_keywords": "hemp, Kentucky, hemp production, test"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3191\"", "article_summary": "Kentucky farmer Michael Lewis said he\u2019s preparing for another year of hemp production to test its potential in textiles, health and nutrition products.\nIn Kentucky, the number of university-led hemp research projects had more than doubled since 2015, the state Agriculture Department said.\nGreg Hall, The Courier-JournalBuy Photo University of Kentucky agronomists Dave Williams looks over the hemp crop at Spindletop Farm in Lexington.\nThe tiny experimental crop produced in 2014 was the first legal hemp crop in generations in Kentucky.\nJune 23, 2014 (Photo: Alton Strupp/The Courier-Journal)Buy PhotoKentucky is accelerating hemp production in the third year of testing its potential as a cash crop."}
