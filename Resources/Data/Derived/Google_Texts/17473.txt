A new poll shows that most people favor Bernie Sanders' proposal to create a federally funded healthcare system to replace Obamacare.

The new Gallup poll shows that 58 percent favor Sanders' idea, while 37 percent oppose it. Another majority also supports simply repealing Obamacare, while 45 percent oppose the idea.

The poll favors Sanders' plan, even though Sanders himself trails Clinton in the race for Democratic delegates, and Clinton is expected to win the nomination in June. Sanders has said the government needs to go far beyond Obamacare, while Clinton has defended the law and says the government should build upon it.

People are evenly split over the idea of leaving the Affordable Care Act as is: 49 percent oppose the idea and 48 percent support it.
