You might be disappointed by the disastrous launch of the healthcare.gov website, or the president\u2019s untrue assertion that people who liked their individual insurance plans would be able to keep them.\n\nAnd the president may have suffered a terrible blow to his political credibility.\n\nBut none of that erases the fact that the new law will provide health insurance to millions of Americans who either haven\u2019t had it, or who have \u201chealth insurance\u201d only in the same sense that a hologram is an actual thing. (Remember the Michael Moore movie, \u201cSicko\u201d? That movie was exclusively about Americans bankrupted by medical bills. All of them had insurance. That's not going to happen anymore.)\n\nAs we learned the other day, more than a million people have already been approved for new coverage, and eventually millions more will have high-quality coverage at a reasonable cost.\n\nThe millions of individual policy holders who received cancellation notices will -- most of them -- ultimately be better off with insurance plans that conform to the requirements of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nHurricane Katrina, the worst and most expensive natural disaster in the history of this country, was responsible for the deaths of more than 1,800 people. And of course, really, it was not a natural disaster at all, but a man-made one. The greatest number of deaths happened after the storm passed, the result of failed levees built by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.\n\nThe literally disastrous federal response, symbolized by the unforgettable photograph of President George W. Bush soaring high over the inundated city, and his woefully uninformed \u201cBrownie, you're doin' a heckuva job,\u201d remain, and will always be, a stain on the Bush administration.\n\nBy contrast, the metaphorically disastrous Obamacare rollout is a temporary, political problem.\n\nOn \u201cGood Morning America\u201d Friday, former Bush advisor Matthew Dowd told George Stephanopoulos that President Obama\u2019s failures around Obamacare were a \"tipping point in the credibility of his presidency,\u201d much the way Bush\u2019s failures around Katrina were in 2005. Though Dowd correctly added that \u201cKatrina is obviously qualitatively different from Obamacare,\" he concluded, \"That is exactly what we are seeing right now.\u201d\n\nHardly.\n\nIn 2005, human suffering was needlessly compounded by an incompetent and immoral federal response.\n\nIf the Affordable Care Act survives, in 25 years the website problems and the president\u2019s failed promise that \u201cyou can keep your plan\u201d will be footnotes in a story about how millions of American were finally able to have what they were entitled to all along: access to healthcare and insurance that actually covers them in their hour of need.\n\nALSO:\n\nMore from Robin Abcarian\n\nBuried bodies identified as members of missing McStay family\n\n\n\nWeHo Halloween burning death was accidental, sheriff's probe finds\n\nTwitter: @robinabcarian\n\nrobin.abcarian@latimes.com", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Stop comparing the Obamacare rollout to Hurricane Katrina!", "Description": "The botched Obamacare rollout is not the botched Hurricane Katrina response.
