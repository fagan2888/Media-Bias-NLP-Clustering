But she can now go to the doctor instead of sitting in the in the Emergency Room if she has a health need.\u201d He continued to rant, so I politely ended the call.\n\nMy point is this, that everyone I\u2019ve talked to knows we should have never been saddled with the \u201cAffordable Care Act.\u201d However, it appears Arkansas made the best of a bad situation and has worked to have a system in place which benefits a lot of people and local hospitals as well. The last estimate of people enrolled is around 250,000.\n\nRegardless of what some legislators say, that is a substantial number of constituents who need representation. We are fortunate to have a viable hospital in Baxter County. In other places, people have to drive hours to reach a hospital because their local hospital was forced to close, and the delay often has tragic results.\n\nHaving also been involved somewhat in the political aspects of the question of the Private Option, I have seen firsthand what some people will do to get elected. Not everything done was ethical or admirable, and I was sorely disappointed to witness some of the things that transpired. I pray our representatives will consider all the demographics of their constituencies and not just the people who contribute to their campaigns.\n\nIn closing, I would like to say I support Governor Hutchinson and the members of the legislature who are trying to do the best for the people of Arkansas, because that\u2019s who they were elected to serve.\n\nMore answers needed from VA\n\nFrom Gene and Rose Sadoski,\n\nMountain Home\n\nMy husband and I are very upset about the change of management in our Mountain Home VA clinic. It has served us well for a long time.\n\nWe suspect this change came about surreptitiously and in secret.\n\nWhy was our local provider not give a chance to bid? Senator Boozman\u2019s office told us that Congress has no influence over what the VA Administration does or decides, but he did try to intervene. Other legislators we contacted did not get back to us after we left messages.\n\nWe called various VA-Little Rock offices, which did not provide any insight to this situation. Those who did answer, said we needed to call some other offices. Some of the other offices that we contacted have not responded so far.\n\nWhere does the answer lie? With these type of responses, we can only suspect deception and subterfuge.\n\nWe are counting on The Baxter Bulletin to dig further.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://www.baxterbulletin.com/story/opinion/2016/04/25/letters-editor/83498824/", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Letters to the editor from Twin Lakes Area residents", "og": {"site_name": "The Baxter Bulletin", "description": "Letters to the editor from Twin Lakes Area residents", "title": "Letters to the Editor", "url": "http://www.baxterbulletin.com/story/opinion/2016/04/25/letters-editor/83498824/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/baxterbulletin.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Letters to the editor from Twin Lakes Area residents", "title": "Letters to the Editor", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/e6f58a4937afeb90947180583b7a7120f736c013/c=25-0-181-156&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2016/04/25/MountainHome/B9321869598Z.1_20160425122216_000_GDPE5DNQQ.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@BBNewsroom", "site": "@BBNewsroom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=875264530", "fb": {"app_id": 183082181717378}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070"}, "article_summary": "In other places, people have to drive hours to reach a hospital because their local hospital was forced to close, and the delay often has tragic results.\nNot everything done was ethical or admirable, and I was sorely disappointed to witness some of the things that transpired.\nSenator Boozman\u2019s office told us that Congress has no influence over what the VA Administration does or decides, but he did try to intervene.\nI pray our representatives will consider all the demographics of their constituencies and not just the people who contribute to their campaigns.\nRegardless of what some legislators say, that is a substantial number of constituents who need representation."}
