A little more than eight years ago, the U.S. Senate, by unanimous consent, agreed to a simple resolution designation making the third week in October National Save for Retirement Week.

The resolution called on government at all levels, the private sector and the nonprofit sector to observe the week “with appropriate programs and activities with the goal of increasing the retirement savings of all the people in the United States.”
