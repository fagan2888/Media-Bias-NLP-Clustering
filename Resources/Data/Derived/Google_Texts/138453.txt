A judge recently placed a Florida-based insurance company into rehabilitation and turned it over to regulators at the Missouri Department of Insurance.

Missouri Department of Insurance Director John M. Huff has been named receiver of Lumbermen’s Underwriting Alliance (LUA), which allows Huff, as receiver, to take over operations of the company.

LUA specializes in providing property allied lines, inland marine, earthquake and workers’ compensation coverage, and is licensed to sell in 48 states – including Delaware, Maryland and Pennsylvania.

During rehabilitation, existing policies will continue to remain in effect, and policyholders should continue to make premium payments in order to keep coverage intact.

Agents who have conducted business with LUA are encouraged to review resources from the Missouri Department of Insurance and at LUA ’s website, each of which contains applicable contact information.

Per the Missouri DOI, rehabilitation was requested after one of LUA ’s largest PEO insureds failed to fully fund its collateral obligations, with the insured thereafter filing for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy protection. The insured’s “failure to fund” resulted in LUA ’s having a $22.5 million dollar deficit position at the end of 2014.

“Putting Lumbermen’s into rehabilitation allows us to ensure the company’s assets are handled properly, so that claims are paid as fully as possible,” said Huff.
