The Pittsburgh Paid Sick Days Act (“PSDA”) and the implementing regulations, which were released in October, were to become effective on January 11, 2016. Instead, because of a lawsuit against the City, this date has been extended by 60 days, to March 10, 2016. (For details of the PSDA, see our article, Pittsburgh Paid Sick Days Act Effective 2016, Notices Available.)

The PSDA requires all employers of employees within the Pittsburgh city limits to provide paid sick leave to all full- and part-time employees.

In September, the Pennsylvania Restaurant and Lodging Association joined several local restaurants in challenging the PSDA, arguing that the City exceeded its municipal authority in enacting the PSDA. The court entered an order in which the City of Pittsburgh and the Association agreed to a 60-day stay of the implementation, application, and enforcement of the PSDA as the court addresses the merits of the Association’s lawsuit.

Therefore, currently, the PSDA is set to take effective on March 10, 2016. However, additional extensions or changes to the PSDA, based on the lawsuit, may come about.

While we await the outcome of the lawsuit, employers with employees working within the City of Pittsburgh should review their existing policies to determine necessary measures to take for compliance with the PSDA.
