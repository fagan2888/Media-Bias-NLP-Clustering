(AP) - Thelma Ladeira knew after her first dance class in Brazil at 5 years old that this was what she \u201cwas going to do for the rest of my life.\u201d\n\nThat was more than 30 years ago and Ladeira, now a New Haven resident, hasn\u2019t missed a beat since. By age 16 after a decade of ballet training, she became a professional, performing modern dance, belly dancing, Brazilian dance on cruise ships and tours in Japan and Europe.\n\nMoving to the United States was never part of the plan, but love brought her here five years ago - and now New Haven is in love with Ladeira\u2019s popular Brazilian dance classes, featuring samba, the fast tempo dance of Brazil, Maculel\u00ea and samba Reggae. Samba was popularized in Brazil, but has a heavy African influence.\n\nLadeira also brings Brazilian dance and culture in New Haven schools and performs around the nation with Ginga Brasileira Dance Co., based in New Haven.\n\nStudents say she brings more than the dance of Brazil - as she casually blends in stories of Brazil\u2019s history and culture.\n\n\u201cThelma is an amazing teacher. She takes something seemingly difficult and she can really break it down,\u201d said student Kelley Traister, who tried samba previously with another teacher, but without success. \u201cIt\u2019s a fun way to get really good exercise. It\u2019s a good way to burn what stress you have in your day with a really fun group of people.\u201d\n\nLina Klaus said she loves that the class brings together people of all ages and backgrounds.\n\n\u201cHer classes are energetic and she brings everyone together,\u201d Klaus said. \u201cShe gives us all a chance to perform.\u201d\n\nLadeira, a warm, energetic woman with extraordinary zest, said there\u2019s much to be learned from Brazilian culture and she especially loves to share that in New Haven public schools and others in Connecticut.\n\nShe said there are heavy Portuguese and African influences in Brazil and no stereotypical face - as the people are a mix of all cultures.\n\n\u201cI think America is a mix of cultures as well,\u201d but Brazilians are always happy, she said.\n\nThat\u2019s where she takes the opening to teach young people, \u201cTo bring joy to people and remind them that we come from mixed cultures.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen I went outside of my country, I could appreciate the culture much more . I want to spread it further,\u201d she said. She also uses cultural lessons to teach kids to be more open.\n\nOf America, Ladeira says, \u201cI love it.\u201d\n\nLadeira has wonderful memories beginning in childhood of dancing samba in Brazil\u2019s Carnival, a days long celebration considered the Mardi Gras of the southern hemisphere. She grew up in the large city of San Paulo.\n\n\u201cEvery year, it\u2019s the most exciting thing. People come together to celebrate life,\u201d she said.\n\nSamba is the main dance and music of Brazil, she said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a kind of lifestyle - everyone grew up hearing samba,\u201d a blend of African and European music, she said. \u201cIt\u2019s music you can feel. The music is in your heart,\u201d she said.\n\nThe connection between Ladeira and her dance students is apparent. No matter what she\u2019s done all day - often she has performed out-of-state before class - Ladeira has a huge smile, energy and enthusiasm, or as she puts it, \u201cThe beat comes from the inside to the outside.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen I connect with my students I feel alive,\u201d she said. \u201cI just breathe and see everyone and we feel this energy.\u201d The dance has lots of foot, hip and shoulder action.\n\nShe also teaches students to perform and brings them to venues to show their talents. While practiced in casual, comfy clothes, samba is typically performed with a colorful head piece, often with feathers, high heels and a Brazilian bikini.\n\n\u201cThey become better and better,\u201d Ladeira said of her students. In many ways, they are learning more than dance, she said, adding that by \u201cputting themselves out there,\u201d students gain confidence they carry into parts of life.\n\n\u201cMaybe you didn\u2019t realize you have so much inside,\u201d she said.\n\nLadeira came to America in 2009 to visit friends and fell in love, moving to America a year later. Her boyfriend - they are still together - introduced her to Mestre Efraim Silva, founder of the Connecticut Capoeira and Dance Center and they formed Ginga Brasileira Dance Co.\n\nTheresa Biagiarelli, who started with samba and now takes Ladeira\u2019s belly-dancing class, said Ladeira is a gifted teacher who introduces moves during warm-up, then blends them naturally.\n\n\u201cShe can make everything fun. You could start a party with three people if you had Thelma,\u201d Biagiarelli said. \u201cI saw Thelma perform and she did things that were amazing.\u201d\n\n___\n\nInformation from: New Haven Register, http://www.nhregister.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "Thelma Ladeira knew after her first dance class in Brazil at 5 years old that this was what she \"was going to do for the rest of my life.\"", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jul/11/samba-instructor-brings-a-taste-of-brazil-to-new-h/", "site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "type": "article", "description": "Thelma Ladeira knew after her first dance class in Brazil at 5 years old that this was what she \u201cwas going to do for the rest of my life.\u201d", "title": "Samba instructor brings a taste of Brazil to New Haven"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "description": "Thelma Ladeira knew after her first dance class in Brazil at 5 years old that this was what she \"was going to do for the rest of my life.\"", "card": "summary", "title": "Samba instructor brings a taste of Brazil to New Haven"}, "Author": "PAM MCLOUGHLIN", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "article_summary": "Ladeira also brings Brazilian dance and culture in New Haven schools and performs around the nation with Ginga Brasileira Dance Co., based in New Haven.\nStudents say she brings more than the dance of Brazil - as she casually blends in stories of Brazil\u2019s history and culture.\nBy age 16 after a decade of ballet training, she became a professional, performing modern dance, belly dancing, Brazilian dance on cruise ships and tours in Japan and Europe.\nSamba is the main dance and music of Brazil, she said.\nSamba was popularized in Brazil, but has a heavy African influence."}
