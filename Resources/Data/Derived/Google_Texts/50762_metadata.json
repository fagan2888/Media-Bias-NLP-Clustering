The TRP compensates these insurers for the costs of large medical claims incurred by their customers. CMS picked up the entire cost of medical claims between $45,000 and $250,000 for individuals enrolled in ObamaCare individual policies in 2014, relieving insurers of the burden of paying these high medical bills.\n\nThe money for the TRP comes from an annual assessment on all individual and group insurance policy holders\u2014primarily people with employer-based coverage\u2014of $63 in 2014, $44 in 2015, and $27 in 2016. In addition to financing the TRP program, the Affordable Care Act (ACA) requires CMS to remit $5 billion of these collections to Treasury.\n\nWhen these collections came up $3.5 billion short over the first two years, CMS made a fateful and unlawful decision: the agency decided to fleece taxpayers in order to pay insurers.\n\nAccording to the Gray legal opinion letter, \u201cby the time the books close on TRP for the 2014 and 2015 benefit years at the end of 2016, reinsurance-eligible issuers will likely have received 98% of expected payments ($15.6 billion out of an expected $16 billion), whereas Treasury will likely have received only 12% of expected payments ($495 million out of an expected $4 billion).\u201d\n\n\u201cThe HHS allocation scheme prioritizing payments to reinsurance-eligible issuers over payments to Treasury violates the ACA,\u201d Gray concludes.\n\nHHS initially issued regulations that would provide taxpayers with their legal share of the reinsurance taxes, but it quickly changed course to put taxpayers last in line for funding. In a March 2014 rulemaking, CMS said Treasury would get its share of the funds even if collections fell short. But ten days later, the agency reversed its position and said, essentially, it would stiff the taxpayer if there was a shortfall.\n\nWhich is just what it is doing. Unlawfully, as Gray\u2019s legal opinion demonstrates.\n\nThe administration is flatfooted in its defense. Acting CMS Administrator Andy Slavitt testified before the House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Oversight on April 15 but was at a loss to explain why the agency changed its rules so swiftly and dramatically.\n\nGray explains that HHS failed to set the tax rate at a level that would produce the required revenue, saying \u201cthe ACA requires the implementation of a collection methodology\u201d to produce the $5 billion owed to Treasury. \u201cCongress,\u201d he emphasizes, \u201cdid not make contributions for payments to Treasury \u2018secondary\u2019 to contributions for payments to reinsurance-eligible insurers.\u201d\n\nGray\u2019s letter references multiple legal precedents to demonstrate that CMS does not have any leeway to ignore this statutory language, as it has done. \u201c[T]he statute does not use \u2018permissive language\u2019 with respect to collections for payments to Treasury,\u201d his letter says. In addition, \u201cHHS\u2019s prioritization scheme is not a permissible interpretation of the law. None of the rationales HHS has offered in support of its prioritization scheme withstand textual scrutiny.\u201d\n\n\u201cCongress specifically protected Treasury\u2019s share of each contribution, declaring that it \u2018may not be used\u2019 for payments to reinsurance-eligible issuers,\u201d the letter declares.\n\nThe ACA requires the administration to remit a total of $5 billion of its reinsurance tax collections to the Treasury, reserving the rest for reinsurance subsidies. The administration chose to bilk the taxpayers to keep health insurers in the game, even as the billions of dollars they are receiving through the TRP and other subsidies subsidies are inadequate to stem their losses for coverage they are offering in the ObamaCare exchanges.\n\nUniversity of Houston Prof. Seth Chandler sums it in Forbes: \u201cIt\u2019s a scheme in which the Obama administration collected less in taxes from health insurers (mostly off the Exchanges) than they were required to do under the Affordable Care Act, created a plan to pay insurers selling policies on the Exchange considerably more than originally projected, and stiffed the United States Treasury on the money it was supposed to receive from the taxes.\u201d\n\nCongress and the courts are rapidly losing patience with the agency\u2019s pattern of malfeasance. In a separate but related case, a federal judge earlier this month ruled that CMS was unlawfully providing billions of dollars in cost-sharing subsidies to insurers, spending money that Congress did not appropriate.\n\nLast week, the House Energy and Commerce Committee moved one step closer to issuing a subpoena to CMS to obtain documents explaining how the agency came to adopt its unlawful approach to the TRP program. Senator Ben Sasse (R-NE) has introduced a bill to address the agency\u2019s actions.\n\nKey arguments in the legal opinion letter from Boyden Gray & Associates\n\nBoyden Gray\u2019s letter analyzes five key areas in which the administration\u2019s justification for its actions involving reinsurance fails legal tests:\n\nThe ACA requires HHS to implement a collection methodology that fully finances the transitional reinsurance program, rendering irrelevant its silence with regard to allocation of insufficient collections. None of HHS\u2019s rationales for prioritizing payments to reinsurance-eligible issuers over payments to Treasury withstand scrutiny. A) the statute does not use \u201cpermissive language\u201d for payments to Treasury; and B) HHS distorts the ACA\u2019s text by asserting that collections for payments to Treasury are secondary because they are to \u201cbe collected \u2018in addition to\u2019\u201d contributions for payments to reinsurance-eligible issuers. The Secretary does not have \u201cgeneral authority\u201d to \u201cdesign the method for determining the contribution amounts\u201d that go \u201ctoward reinsurance payments.\u201d HHS\u2019s reliance on the ACA\u2019s policy goals of market certainty and premium stabilization to justify its prioritization scheme impermissibly ignores the act\u2019s competing policy goal of protecting the federal fisc. HHS\u2019s use of notice-and-comment to adopt its regulations prioritizing payments to reinsurance-eligible issuers does not render them lawful.\n\nGrace-Marie Turner is president of the Galen Institute, where Doug Badger serves as a senior fellow.
