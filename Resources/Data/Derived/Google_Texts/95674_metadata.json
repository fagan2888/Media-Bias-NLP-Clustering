Maybe the toughest in the long, drawn-out battle against Ebola in West Africa.\n\nCases are rising at an exponential rate. Families don't have any place to take sick loved ones. And researchers now say the epidemic could last for a 1 1/2 years.\n\nBut then at 4:30 p.m. on Friday, a little nugget of joy and hope came through my email: a 55-second video of Mamadee dancing (and dancing quite well).\n\nAccording to Doctors Without Border, Mamadee was diagnosed with Ebola at a treatment center in Foya, Liberia, where only about a third of people have survived.\n\nThe 11-year-old boy had to stay in isolation for more than two weeks. And he lost his sister to Ebola during that time.\n\nBut he never stopped dancing.\n\n\"He jumps, he ducks, he steps to the side, first left, then right, then left ... swings his hips and shakes his arms,\" Doctors Without Borders writes. \"He doesn't stop, and he doesn't get tired. It is difficult to believe, but Mamadee is an Ebola-confirmed patient.\"\n\nEven with a health worker standing by in a full protective suit (check out the guy on the left at 0:43), Mamadee steals the show. His spirit shines through.\n\nEbola be damned.\n\nCopyright 2016 NPR. To see more, visit http://www.npr.org/.\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OQXZWz15_A\n\nMissing some content? Care to comment?
