If you\u2019re enrolled in Medicare, you\u2019re set \u2013 you\u2019re not required to purchase insurance through the Affordable Care Act health insurance exchanges. Medicare supplement plans, the theme of most spam messages, are optional \u2013 and not part of ACA exchanges. But spammers seem to be counting on you emerging from the blizzard of news about the ACA thinking it means you have to buy a new policy.\n\nSpammers tend to be devoted news hounds \u2013 and bad headlines usually translate to good business for them. With every natural disaster, there\u2019s a tornado of emails for charity scams aiming to collect fraudulent donations or inviting you to click on disaster photo links that in fact load your device up with malware.\n\nAnd yet this time around, the surprising thing is that Internet security watchdogs report very little spam that directly mentions the man-made disaster dominating the news: the launch of the HealthCare.gov website.\n\nAfter tracking billions of messages, Sophos security advisor Chet Wisniewski tells TechNewsWorld that only \u201ca couple hundred\u201d messages mentioning that website, Obamacare, or the Affordable Care Act have been found in its spam traps. Why? Spammers may be having a hard time figuring out how to make money directly from the launch woes. Wisniewski quips that \u201cthe spammers are probably spending their time trying to hack HealthCare.gov.\u201d\n\nBetter just to tap public confusion.\n\n>> Get entertainment and dining discounts with your AARP Member Advantages.\n\nSome spam is merely annoying, pitching actual products that may or may not be a good deal for you \u2014 and spammers make money every time you click on a spam message, and more if you actually buy a product. But other spam is outright criminal, seeking to steal your money or identity.\n\nWhichever it is, you should think twice before clicking on spam or online ads touting \u201cMedicare\u201d plans.\n\nSome recent subject lines from flagged spam include:\n\nMedicare open enrollment For 2014 ends Dec 7 \u2013 Find a plan today..\n\nMedicare Supplement Insurance information. Health coverage for seniors \u2026\n\nMedicare Enrollment Must be Done Today (face fines for not choosing)\n\nMedicare enrollment period for 2013.
