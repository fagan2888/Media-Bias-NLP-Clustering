For the first time, Britons will be able to legally test for HIV from the comfort of their own home, thanks to a new product, the BioSure HIV Self Test. It works similar to the OraQuick In-Home HIV test, which has been on sale in the United States since 2012, but reduces wait time and delivers more accurate results.

The BioSure HIV Self Test uses a small finger prick of blood to detect the presence of HIV antibodies and gives 99.7 percent accurate results in about 15 minutes, Mirror reported, This differs from the OraQuick test that uses a mouth swab to test for the same antigens, which can take up to 40 minutes to deliver results and, in studies, only detected 91.7 percent of people infected with HIV.

The BioSure kit is also easy to use and looks similar to a pregnancy test, with two purple lines appearing if the result is positive. Most importantly, the test carries the European side specialist CE mark, showing that it has passed rigorous tests and is able to give a more accurate reading.

BioSure test creators hope to reach individuals who would otherwise not get tested for HIV. The Daily Mail reported that in the UK there are an estimated 26,000 people who are unware of their HIV status, and according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in the U.S. around 14 percent of the 1.2 million HIV-positive indivuals are unaware of their infection.

“Knowing your HIV status is critical and the launch of this product will empower people to discreetly test themselves when it is convenient to them and in a place where they feel comfortable,” BioSure founder Brigette Bard explained, as reported by The Daily Mail.
