A 2013 study by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation reported a visit to the ER costs about $580 more on average than the same treatment administered in a primary care doctor\u2019s office.\n\nOne of the stated primary goals of Obamacare is to expand Medicaid, even though it\u2019s long been known Medicaid patients use the ER more than patients with other means of paying, says Dr. John O\u2019Shea, a Pennsylvania surgeon who also serves as senior fellow in The Heritage Foundation\u2019s Center for Health Policy Studies.\n\nThe problems are worse in states with the greatest shortage of primary care physicians, which are the same states experiencing the largest expansion of Medicaid, O\u2019Shea says. This situation will be exacerbated if government projections of primary care physician shortages come true. Some experts predict the United States could have a shortage of primary care physicians exceeding 20,000 doctors by 2020.\n\nO\u2019Shea says the cost of health care is also being driven up by government officials picking plans for low-income patients rather than allowing market forces to control the process, including allowing these patients to choose care that works best for them.\n\n\u201cThis is another serious reminder the government picking plans, even for Medicaid patients, just doesn\u2019t work,\u201d O\u2019Shea said. \u201cIt would be better for the government to heavily subsidize patients and let them choose the care that works best for them, rather than what is happening now.\u201d\n\nBut instead of doing the hard work of addressing specific problems within the health care system, such as the lack of access to primary care doctors by Medicaid patients, O\u2019Shea says it was politically easier just to declare millions of previously uninsured people were now covered.\n\n\u201cIt looks really good politically, and that\u2019s what they went for,\u201d O\u2019Shea said.\n\nThis article originally appeared in Health Care News.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.\n\n\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"fb": {"pages": 1742097289343962}, "generator": "WordPress 4.4", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1412\"", "article_summary": "All people make their choices based on incentives, and yet Obamacare did nothing to require co-pays from Medicaid patients, Armstrong says.\n\u201cObamacare obviously did nothing to reduce the incentive for patients to use the ER as their primary care doctor,\u201d Armstrong said.\nThis situation will be exacerbated if government projections of primary care physician shortages come true.\nThis article originally appeared in Health Care News.\n\u201cThis is another serious reminder the government picking plans, even for Medicaid patients, just doesn\u2019t work,\u201d O\u2019Shea said."}
