And another, a defensive lineman, had never caught a touchdown pass. Ever.\n\nThis Sunday, Peyton Manning could very well throw three touchdown passes, which would give him an astounding 500 for his NFL career. Those who have caught many of the 497 are superstars, be it Marshall Faulk or Marvin Harrison or Demaryius Thomas. There are 12 men who have caught one \u2014 but only one \u2014 touchdown pass from Manning. They\u2019re forever part of history, even if many are long forgotten by most fans.\n\n\u201cBelieve it or not, I found a few minutes to think about some of (them),\u201d Manning said this week. \u201cA guy named Trevor Insley, he caught one. Of course (Broncos defensive tackle) Mitch Unrein would be in that category. There was a tight end named Mike Roberg in there. Lamont Warren. Tom Santi from Virginia. Gijon Robinson. The scary thing is I can actually remember the touchdown \u2014 Gijon Robinson caught a goal line naked against New England in New England. Fake bootleg left, roll right, wide open because nobody thought we would be throwing it to Gijon Robinson. I can\u2019t remember a lot of things \u2014 important things \u2014 but I have a lot of useless information in my mind.\u201d\n\nOf the Touchdown Twelve, only two played for the Broncos (Lance Ball and Unrein), though three were born in Colorado \u2014 Aaron Moorehead (Aurora), Robinson (Denver) and Unrein (Eaton).\n\nMeanwhile, Warren attended Colorado under McCartney from 1991-93 and caught Peyton\u2019s 10th career touchdown pass for Indianapolis \u2014 the city where Warren happened to be born.\n\nKenton Keith, who caught a 4-yard touchdown pass in 2007, is a cousin of the great Roger Craig, while Dan Klecko, who hauled in a 2-yard toss on the last day of the 2006 season, is the son of former New York Jets Pro Bowler Joe Klecko.\n\nAs for the 497 touchdown throws, \u201cLet me say this,\u201d Luke Lawton explained. \u201cMine has to be his easiest one. It was just a shovel pass on the goal line. I was in the backfield, I ran in front of the line and he kind of underhand-flipped it to me, kind of like an option pitch. And I took it in, just like that.\u201d\n\nLawton\u2019s 1-yard haul gave Indianapolis a fourth-quarter cushion in a 2007 win against the Jacksonville Jaguars. Now 34, he\u2019s a reserve in the Marines.\n\nMoorehead (9-yard catch in 2006) is now an assistant coach at Virginia Tech.\n\nJim Finn (4-yard catch in 2000) was indeed Mr. Irrelevant, picked last in the 1999 draft. For three seasons (2004-06), Finn caught passes from Manning\u2019s brother, Eli, in New York, but his only career touchdown came courtesy of Peyton.\n\nUnrein is still on the Denver defense. But the Broncos put in the large load on offense for a 2012 game, and suddenly there he was in the huddle, Manning\u2019s first read in a goal-line progression.\n\n\u201cThe ball was in the air \u2014 it seemed like time just slowed down, just kind of stood still,\u201d Unrein said. \u201cIt was so weird, I could see all the fans in the background, and I could see the laces spinning, and all I could think was \u2014 don\u2019t drop it, don\u2019t drop it, don\u2019t drop it.\n\n\u201d I caught it, the crowd went crazy, and I stood there for a second or two, didn\u2019t really know what to do. So I decided to spike it. And then right after it, I was like, \u2018Where did the ball go?\u2019 \u201c\n\nUnrein had never caught a touchdown at any level and today has the ball in his basement trophy case, alongside awards earned by his wife, bronze-medal Olympic trapshooter Corey Cogdell.\n\nBut perhaps the most obscure of the scorers is Roberg, who only caught two NFL passes, one for a touchdown, which made his LinkedIn page. Roberg turned 37 on Thursday, and when initially contacted by the media this week, he thought \u2014 \u201cMan, this sounds like one of my buddies in Denver, trying to set me up.\u201d\n\nRoberg\u2019s second and final NFL reception happened against the Tennessee Titans in 2002.\n\n\u201cThe play was your typical third-and-1, a play-action to the tight end \u2014 nobody was covering me,\u201d he said of the touchdown toss. \u201cAll I had to do was catch the ball. I kept the ball. It\u2019s one of the things that people always ask \u2014 \u2018If your house caught on fire, what\u2019s one thing you\u2019d probably grab?\u2019 And I\u2019d lean toward that, because it\u2019s a priceless thing.\n\n\u201cWhat I know now, I wish I would\u2019ve had Peyton sign it. I thought someday he\u2019d be at this mark, to break the all-time record. It\u2019ll be cool to say that I was part of it.\u201d\n\nBrandon Krisztal, host of The Post\u2019s online show \u201cThe Press Box,\u201d contributed to this report.\n\nBenjamin Hochman: bhochman@denverpost.com or twitter.com/hochman", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Hochman: No Demaryius or Harrison in this crowd of one-timers", "title": "Hochman: No Demaryius or Harrison in this crowd of one-timers", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/09/19/hochman-no-demaryius-or-harrison-in-this-crowd-of-one-timers/", "image": {"width": 410, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140919__20140920_B1_SP20HOCHMANp2.jpg", "height": 653}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140919__20140920_B1_SP20HOCHMANp2.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-09-19T21:20:14+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T12:48:22+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "There are 12 men who have caught one \u2014 but only one \u2014 touchdown pass from Manning.\nThose who have caught many of the 497 are superstars, be it Marshall Faulk or Marvin Harrison or Demaryius Thomas.\nThe scary thing is I can actually remember the touchdown \u2014 Gijon Robinson caught a goal line naked against New England in New England.\nAnd another, a defensive lineman, had never caught a touchdown pass.\nOn one of the guys\u2019 LinkedIn pages, his accomplishments include \u201cEmployee of the Quarter 2009\u201d and \u201cCaught 1 Touchdown Pass from Peyton Manning.\u201dAnother guy was Mr."}
