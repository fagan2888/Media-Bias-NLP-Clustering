He will be the president that can reset the world, bring us together and solve hard problems,\" Graham said.\n\nIn making his announcement, Graham also said that a Bush rival, Florida Senator Marco Rubio, was, at 44, too young to be president. Rubio delivered a strong performance Thursday night at a debate of the top seven Republican candidates, an event that front-runner Donald Trump was seen as winning.\n\nGraham, 60, said he believed Rubio would be president some day, but not following the Nov. 8 election.\n\nPointing to his own experience, he said at age 44: \"I was not ready to be president.\"\n\nStung by a series of ads against him from the Bush campaign and the SuperPAC that supports Bush, Rubio released a TV ad on Friday, calling Bush desperate.\n\nBush waved off the attacks, suggesting Rubio has been too sensitive in the hypercompetitive political world.\n\n\"If you're a candidate, you can't play the role of victim, and he shouldn't either,\" Bush said.\n\nGraham said Trump's proposed ban on Muslims entering the United States would complicate efforts to gain support from governments in the Middle East. At the debate, Bush had said Trump's idea was flawed and that a Muslim alliance was vital.\n\nGraham, who has been a sharp Trump critic, said Bush's bid to woo Latino voters was also critical in widening the reach of the Republican Party, which has not won the presidency since Bush's brother, George W. Bush, was reelected in 2004.\n\nBush, said Graham, \"wants to expand a party that desperately needs to grow.\"\n\nTrump dismissed Graham's move on Twitter.\n\n\"Sen. Lindsey Graham embarrassed himself with his failed run for President and now further embarrasses himself with endorsement of Bush,\" he tweeted.\n\n(Editing by Bernadette Baum)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "CHARLESTON, S.C./WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican candidate Jeb Bush was endorsed by", "title": "Jeb Bush endorsed by former rival Lindsey Graham in key state", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/01/15/South-Carolinas-Graham-endorse-Jeb-Bush-2016-White-House-race", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-elections-bush_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/01/15/South-Carolinas-Graham-endorse-Jeb-Bush-2016-White-House-race", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-elections-bush_1.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "CHARLESTON, S.C./WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican candidate Jeb Bush was endorsed by", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Stung by a series of ads against him from the Bush campaign and the SuperPAC that supports Bush, Rubio released a TV ad on Friday, calling Bush desperate.\nIn making his announcement, Graham also said that a Bush rival, Florida Senator Marco Rubio, was, at 44, too young to be president.\n\"Sen.
