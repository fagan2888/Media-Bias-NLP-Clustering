And one of the bigger agencies in Wisconsin also is on the verge of closing:\n\n\"The president has looked to cut Medicare, to cut our seniors, to get additional revenue to pay for ObamaCare,\" said Republican congressman Sean Duffy, in whose district the Wisconsin agency operated. \"And the bottom line is real: seniors are getting hurt.\"\n\nThe administration has acknowledged the cuts would force 40 percent of providers into the red, but it simultaneously argued the decision would not have a significant economic impact.\n\nEven a federal agency rejected that argument. The Small Business Administration complained in a six-page letter last year that the cuts were made \"without providing a factual basis for the certification...\" which, it noted, is required by law.\n\nIn addition, 51 Senators, including 36 key Democrats, wrote the administration urging it to back off -- but it went ahead anyway.\n\n\"When you get 51 Senators, Democrats and Republicans from far different spectrums of the political aisle, come together to urge the administration not to do this to home health care,\" said Duffy, \"you know it\u2019s striking a chord across America.\"\n\nJim Angle currently serves as chief national correspondent for Fox News Channel (FNC).
