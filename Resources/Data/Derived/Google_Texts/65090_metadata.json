Locations in Newark, Woodbridge, Linden and Bayonne are open until 7 p.m. with their last collection at 5.\n\nFive tax myths that skew the national debate | Moran\n\nAlthough the USPS cannot differentiate between someone mailing their taxes or just a birthday card on Tax Day, Brennan said the number of people who file through the mail is declining.\n\nAccording to the IRS, the tax agency expects 23 million returns to be filed through the mail, down 7 percent from last year. As of March 28, 82 million people have filed electronically, while only 8.3 million were done on paper.\n\nIf desperate, residents can head into New York City and send out their taxes at The James A. Farley Post Office near Penn Station until midnight.\n\nThe Wilmington Post Office in Delaware will also be open until 10 p.m.\n\nThe USPS has offered the following tips for those mailing in their taxes:\n\nIf you're dropping your taxes in a blue collection box, double-check the last scheduled pick-up time.\n\nTax forms are no longer available at Post Offices. Federal forms are available here and state forms here.\n\nMake sure the postage is correct. The IRS will not pay postage due and your filings will be returned if there is insufficient postage.\n\nDon't forget a return address.\n\nCraig McCarthy may be reached at CMcCarthy@njadvancemedia.com.
