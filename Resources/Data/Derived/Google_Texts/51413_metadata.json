His alma mater, the University of Pennsylvania, didn't make the tournament.\n\nRelated: Here's How Much Americans Will Bet on March Madness\n\nJohn Brynjolfsson, head of Irvine, California-based hedge fund firm Armored Wolf, said two underdogs will make it to the semifinals in Indianapolis: No. 13 seeds Harvard and UC Irvine. The Columbia College grad, who runs $500 million in assets, also thinks Kentucky will make the Final Four, but he said the Wildcats won't win.\n\n\"As a fiduciary, I can't root for Kentucky, as that would destabilize a few bookmakers who laid out huge odds against them,\" Brynjolfsson joked to CNBC.com. He likes Duke to win it all.\n\nOthers are sticking with blue-chip teams. Another billionaire, private equity titan David Bonderman of TPG, thinks undefeated Kentucky will win it all. Bonderman, a University of Washington grad whose firm oversees $65 billion, also likes No. 2 Arizona, No. 1 Duke and No. 2 Virginia to make it to the Final Four.\n\nSteve Pagliuca, managing director at $80 billion Bain Capital and co-owner of the Boston Celtics, thinks the top four teams will be Kentucky, Arizona, Virginia and Duke. A Duke alum, he likes the Blue Devils to go all the way.\n\nRelated: 6 Ways to Bring Sanity to Your March Madness Picks\n\nLike Pagliuca, several prominent investors picked their own alma maters to win, a move some see as a classic sentimental trap.\n\nA case in point is billionaire hedge fund honcho Paul Tudor Jones. He thinks his beloved No. 2 seed UVA will win the national championship. Jones' Greenwich, Connecticut-based Tudor Investment Corp. runs about $13 billion.\n\nJaffray Woodriff, another Virginia alum, who runs $1.2 billion hedge fund firm Quantitative Investment Management, also thinks the Cavaliers will ultimately cut down the net. QIM is based near UVA inCharlottesville, and Woodriff is a donor to the school's squash program.\n\nSome money managers, true to their secretive nature, declined to give or did not respond to requests for comment. A few examples of those who prefer to keep their picks private include Julian Robertson of Tiger Management (a North Carolina alum); Josh Harris of Apollo Global Management (a UPenn grad and Philadelphia 76ers co-owner); and Jamie Dinan of York Capital (another UPenn alum and Milwaukee Bucks co-owner).\n\nThis article originally appeared in CNBC.\n\nRead more at CNBC:\n\nLive: Yellen says can't rule out June rate hike\n\nFed indicates rate hikes coming, but not in April\n\nHere's what changed in the new Fed statement", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Some prominent investment managers are contrarian in their NCAA men's basketball tourn", "title": "Billionaires Make Their March Madness Picks", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/03/18/Billionaires-Make-Their-March-Madness-Picks", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/03182011_MarchMadness_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/03/18/Billionaires-Make-Their-March-Madness-Picks", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/03182011_MarchMadness_article.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Some prominent investment managers are contrarian in their NCAA men's basketball tourn", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda91c\"", "article_summary": "Steve Cohen, the billionaire head of Point72 Asset Management, thinks No.\nA Duke alum, he likes the Blue Devils to go all the way.\nSome prominent investment managers are contrarian in their NCAA men's basketball tournament Final Four picks.\nCohen\u2014who oversees about $10 billion at his Connecticut-based family office\u2014likes more conventional teams to round out the Final Four: No.\nThe Columbia College grad, who runs $500 million in assets, also thinks Kentucky will make the Final Four, but he said the Wildcats won't win."}
