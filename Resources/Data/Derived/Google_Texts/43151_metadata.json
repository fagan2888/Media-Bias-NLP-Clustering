(Photo: Tribune photo/Phil Drake)Buy Photo\n\nHELEN \u2013 A lawmaker on Friday called for a plan to be developed in the state to deal with growing mental health issues, costs and challenges, saying it will likely take a bigger chunk out of Montana\u2019s budget as time goes on.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have a good Montana plan, and we do not know in the state of Montana where we are headed,\u201d Rep. Ron Ehli, R-Hamilton, told nearly 150 people attending the 2016 biennial Mental Health Policy Summit at the Best Western Premier Helena Great Northern Hotel.\n\nEhli, Sen. Mary Caferro, D-Helena; and Sen. Roger Webb, R-Billings; all served on the Health and Human Services Committee during the 2015 legislative session. Rep. Carolyn Pease-Lopez, D-Billings, served on the Human Services Committee. They participated in a panel discussion on mental health issues in Montana.\n\nDan Aune, executive director of Mental Health America of Montana, said the groups at the summit would list priorities for the 2017 legislative session. The groups favor transitioning mental health services from institutions to community-based services.\n\nHe said there were 20,000 Montanans with serious, disabling mental illnesses.\n\nEhli said Health and Human Services makes up $4.5 billion of the state\u2019s $10 billion biennial budget, but yet it\u2019s rarely discussed on the campaign trail.\n\nRep. Ron Ehli, R-Hamilton (Photo: Photo courtesy state of Montana)\n\n\u201cIf you just listen to the rhetoric, how much do you hear about Health and Human Services?\u201d he asked. \u201cIt\u2019s not even on the the radar of discussion. At some point it will hit the radar screen.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have to find a way to make the best use of those dollars,\u201d he said.\n\nEhli said as a businessman he knows that a growth plan is helpful, and he said there is a lack of planning.\n\n\u201cWe need a plan. The debate is do we go top down or bottom up,\u201d he said. \u201cHow do we find the answer to that question?\u201d\n\nHe asked if that comes from the governor\u2019s office, the Legislature or public groundswell.\n\nWebb noted during the last legislative session that several bills passed bringing more funding to mental health.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t dip our toe into the water, we jumped in,\u201d he said.\n\nWebb and Caferro talked about growing concern over the rise of Alzheimer\u2019s and dementia cases in the state.\n\nCaferro called it \u201ca real fear that is the tip of the iceberg,\u201d noting that 20,000 Montanans are living with Alzheimer\u2019s and dementia. She said a group outside of government is working on a state plan for dealing with those diseases.\n\nWebb said that by 2030 one in four Montanans would be subjected to Alzheimer\u2019s and dementia.\n\nDuring a morning session, Sen. Ed Buttrey, R-Great Falls, and Tara Veazy, the governor\u2019s policy adviser for health and families, spoke about how the state expanded its Medicaid program that 32,000 Montanans now use as part of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe plan adopted by the state Legislature has a four-year sunset clause.\n\nShe said no matter the success of the current program, \u201cthere is going to be a fight in 2019.\u201d\n\nButtrey said he realized in 2013 something would have to be done to meet mandates of the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cWe knew that with any solution, we didn\u2019t want it to result in a huge growth in government,\u201d he said.\n\nIt was then determined to come up with a uniquely Montana solution.\n\nA plan was devised that included tying health care to economic development, focusing on personal responsibility and creating an oversight committee.\n\n\u201cBut we needed a solution that would cross the finish line and (get approval from) a federal government that was not all that friendly with states coming up with their own solutions,\u201d he said.\n\nMontana\u2019s plan was approved in November.\n\nVeazy said the process was \u201cnot all rainbows and unicorns, it was really, really tough.\u201d\n\nAnd as a result, 32,000 Montanans are getting benefits today.\n\n\u201cThe importance of the results is hard to estimate,\u201d she said. \u201cThirty-two thousand is not just a number, but it\u2019s 32,000 whose lives have changed.\u201d\n\nOther event sponsors included American Association for Marriage and Family Therapy, National Association of Social Workers and the Montana Licensed Clinical Professional Counselors Association.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://gftrib.com/1XCRgMW", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Mental health groups meet in Helena to discuss issues, challenges for 2017 legislative session", "og": {"site_name": "Great Falls Tribune", "description": "Mental health groups meet in Helena to discuss issues, challenges for 2017 legislative session", "title": "Lawmaker urges plan on mental health", "url": "http://www.greatfallstribune.com/story/news/local/2016/02/19/lawmaker-urges-plan-mental-health/80638824/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/greatfallstribune.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Mental health groups meet in Helena to discuss issues, challenges for 2017 legislative session", "title": "Lawmaker urges plan on mental health", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/fb07c7ddafb87754d5cfdedb191bcd1487cd7b0a/c=586-0-2315-1729&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2016/02/19/GreatFalls/B9321007170Z.1_20160219201209_000_GFJDGRRJM.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@GFTribune", "site": "@GFTribune", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=863095595", "fb": {"app_id": 137930962930704}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070"}, "article_summary": "The groups favor transitioning mental health services from institutions to community-based services.\nThey participated in a panel discussion on mental health issues in Montana.\nShe said a group outside of government is working on a state plan for dealing with those diseases.\nWebb noted during the last legislative session that several bills passed bringing more funding to mental health.\nDan Aune, executive director of Mental Health America of Montana, said the groups at the summit would list priorities for the 2017 legislative session."}
