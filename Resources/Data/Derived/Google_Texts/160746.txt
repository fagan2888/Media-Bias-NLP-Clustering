BUFFALO — Matt Duchene had an off game for Colorado in a 4-1 loss to the Sabres Sunday, not getting on the scoresheet and also drawing all three Avalanche minors — one for cross-checking, one for hooking and one for high-sticking.

The Avs successfully killed off all three, though.

“I’d rather see him having a hat trick than three penalties, that’s for sure,” Colorado coach Patrick Roy said.

Duchene, who had two of the Avalanche’s 35 shots on the Sabres’ Swedish goalie Robin Lehner, also was a minus-2.

Grigo’s return. Mikhail Grigorenko, the Sabres’ 2012 first-round draft choice, logged 19 minutes and had an assist in his first game back at Buffalo since the summer trade that brought him to Colorado.

“It was nice to come back in this building and have a lot of good memories,” he said after the game. “I was really excited. I wish we won the game, but it was good.”

He added, “It was a little bit more special than other games, but at the same time I’ve got to go out there and try to help your team win. It didn’t work out today, but yeah, obviously it was special.”

Matinee. After the rare afternoon game — actually, the official start time was 10:30 a.m. Mountain time — the Avalanche was expected to arrive back in Denver early in the evening.

Colorado has a Wednesday home game against Montreal, with the Avs hoping to overcome what this season has been the dreaded home-ice disadvantage before heading back out on the road to Edmonton and Vancouver.

Standings. After the NHL’s limited Sunday schedule, the Avalanche (29-26-4) still was in what would be the first of the two Western Conference playoff spots. Colorado was one point up on Nashville, in the other wild-card spot; and six ahead of Minnesota, Arizona and Vancouver.

Status quo. The Avalanche healthy scratches against Buffalo again were defensemen Nate Guenin and Zach Redmond.
