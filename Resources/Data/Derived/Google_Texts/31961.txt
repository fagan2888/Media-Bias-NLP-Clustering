At the Denver Breakfast Club, we love eggy goodness with a Southwestern twist. Which is why the tamales at Annie’s Cafe keep bringing us back.

I’ve been a fan of Annie’s for more than a half-dozen years. It’s a cozy set of rooms at the southeast corner of East Colfax Avenue and St. Paul Street, decorated with old movie posters and vintage lunch boxes. The televisions are always tuned to TCM, which means you get to fill in the gaps in your movie viewing while sipping your morning coffee. (A recent showing: “Days of Wine and Roses” with Jack Lemmon and Lee Remick — a decidedly downbeat way to start the day, but a classic film nonetheless.)

Right before Christmas, I was there for my holiday fix of tamales. Well, one of them, at least. Annie’s does a savory version: Two moist corn tamales (they dehusk them for you before plating) that are packed with shredded pork and masa, then smothered in pork green chile and cheese. You also get two eggs your way, black beans and a flour tortilla.

What’s not to love?
