I think I\u2019m learning how to better manage my time as I go forward.\u201d\n\nThe NHL can be a clubhouse of the closed-minded. To get in to that wing of the league\u2019s power structure, you have to know the handshake and the password, and it\u2019s even better if you have scars to show and stories about \u201cthat night\u201d \u2014 or any night \u2014 in, let\u2019s say, Buffalo. Don\u2019t pass muster, and you can be dismissed, with fresh ideas scorned too. There is an in- tuitive feel that comes from playing it or being around it for years (as was Lacroix), but it\u2019s not the only way to have sound and even innovative ideas about how to spot talent, make a team better and \u2014 especially \u2014 how to use sound business principles to run a hockey team in a salary cap league.\n\nSo, yes, even if Josh Kroenke wanted to jump in and say to hockey men, \u201cHey, have we ever thought about doing this?\u201d or even, \u201cThat guy sure looks good to me,\u201d I\u2019m not going to characterize that as an owner\u2019s son, or a \u201cbasketball guy,\u201d meddling.\n\nOn the basketball side of the operation, the input of Kroenke, his father and others remains influential, as the extent of general manager Tim Connelly\u2019s power is difficult to pinpoint.\n\nOn the hockey side, it\u2019s clear that Josh Kroenke still is an overseeing CEO for the Avalanche, often deferring to Joe Sakic and Patrick Roy.\n\nSaturday, I asked Kroenke to compare how directly he is involved in the hockey operation vs. the basketball operation.\n\n\u201cMy roles have changed in the organizations as I\u2019ve evolved,\u201d he said. \u201cNow I would say it\u2019s very evenly balanced in how I spread my duties.\u201d\n\nThe Avalanche\u2019s 2014-15 season ended Saturday with Colorado at 90 points and finishing last in the Central Division. This is going to be the first time since the arrival of the Avs in 1995 \u2014 and since Stan Kroenke purchased the teams and arena in 2000 \u2014 that there will be no NBA or NHL playoff games in Denver.\n\n\u201cWe had a great streak going for a number of years,\u201d Josh Kroenke said. \u201cIt\u2019s disappointing, but I\u2019m already looking forward to showing everybody how we can bounce back next year.\u201d\n\nOf the Avalanche specifically, he said: \u201cI think we\u2019re all disappointed. From myself, to Patty, to Joe, to everybody down in the locker room. With that being said, I don\u2019t think we\u2019re disappointed about the way we went about our process. I saw that Joe had a few quotes about how there is a process to learning how to win at the highest level, and sometimes you want to skip all the steps. But there are some young guys out there going through it. We all said it at the beginning of this year, that this year was going to be a lot harder than last year. I don\u2019t think a few of the guys understood that right away, and sometimes the best way to learn is to go through it.\u201d\n\nHow can the Avalanche bounce back?\n\n\u201cA year of growth,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can get healthy, and that\u2019s a big one for us. \u2026 A few guys might not have realized how hard the second year was going to be, but they bounced back, and that\u2019s what I\u2019m most impressed with \u2014 how our group came together and they persevered and they fought down the stretch. Even though it was right on the brink of elimination, they continued to battle, and that\u2019s the character I want from all of our teams.\u201d\n\nAnd his evaluation of Sakic and Roy?\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve been fantastic,\u201d Kroenke said. \u201cI think last season speaks for itself. I think obviously this year, we\u2019re a little disappointed not being in the playoffs because that\u2019s going to be our goal, to get in there every year and compete. But I think they\u2019ve done an outstanding job and I think they\u2019re both learning on the fly as well. They\u2019re great guys and they\u2019re hard workers, and those two in combination with their experiences in life as hockey players and now as a coach and executive, I think they\u2019re doing a great job.\u201d\n\nYes, he said \u201con the fly.\u201d\n\nJust like a hockey guy.\n\nTerry Frei: tfrei @denverpost.com or twitter.com/TFrei", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Frei: Josh Kroenke warming up to life in icebox", "title": "Frei: Josh Kroenke warming up to life in icebox", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/04/12/frei-josh-kroenke-warming-up-to-life-in-icebox/", "image": {"width": 512, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg", "height": 512}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2015-04-12T20:22:08+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-05-23T02:47:36+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Terry Frei"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd12d0\"", "article_summary": "But I think they\u2019ve done an outstanding job and I think they\u2019re both learning on the fly as well.\nI think I\u2019m learning how to better manage my time as I go forward.\u201dThe NHL can be a clubhouse of the closed-minded.\n\u201cWe had a great streak going for a number of years,\u201d Josh Kroenke said.\nOn the hockey side, it\u2019s clear that Josh Kroenke still is an overseeing CEO for the Avalanche, often deferring to Joe Sakic and Patrick Roy.\nJosh Kroenke is a \u201cbasketball guy,\u201d a label he earned with more than affinity for the sport, but also with a solid career on the floor for Missouri, including two seasons as the Tigers\u2019 captain."}
