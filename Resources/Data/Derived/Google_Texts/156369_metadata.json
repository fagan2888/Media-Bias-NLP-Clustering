EMU does cover IVF treatments, but the percentage covered varies depending on an individual employee's chosen health care plan, said EMU spokesman Geoff Larcom.\n\n\"It just doesn't make sense for us to be the ones lagging behind,\" Rodriguez said, adding that the benefit would make U-M a more competitive workplace among elite universities.\n\nElizabeth Walker, a U-M staff member, also asked the board to change its policy.\n\n\"Infertility is a disease and causes a significant amount of anxiety and depression, made worse when patients are required to pay for treatment out of pocket,\" she said.\n\nKellie Woodhouse covers higher education for the Ann Arbor News.
