The oversized rates were allowed by the Connecticut Insurance Department and only ended with the implementation of Obamacare.\n\nAn analysis of nearly six years of Aetna's filings at the Connecticut Insurance Department, obtained by The Connecticut Mirror in large part through a Freedom of Information request, shows that before approval of the Affordable Care Act, no other health insurer in Connecticut has had such a consistently good margin on any line of business like Aetna had on the policies it sold individuals. In fact, few insurers across the United States enjoyed that kind of margin, regulators and analysts say.\n\nYet in the eight years that Aetna has been selling individual health insurance policies in Connecticut, state regulators have never rejected the company\u2019s request for a rate increase.\n\nThe medical loss ratio\n\nHealth insurers gamble that they will take in more money in premiums than they have to pay out in claims, a formula known as the medical loss ratio. Companies\u2019 adjusters try to control this ratio by predicting how much risk their company is taking on.\n\nThere is a link between the medical loss ratio and profits: The lower the medical loss ratio, the less spent on health care, and the more spent on overhead costs, including profit.\n\nIn 2011, the Affordable Care Act changed the rules for Aetna by setting a limit on the amount of premium dollars a company can earn over the claims, taxes and fees it has to pay. It requires insurers to pay out on claims at least 80 percent of the premiums collected on individual policies and 85 percent of the premiums earned on group policies.\n\nBefore the ACA changed things, Aetna\u2019s expenses for claims on policies sold to Connecticut residents seldom rose much higher than 55 percent of premiums paid. That left the company with around 45 percent revenue on the policies.\n\nThat\u2019s a much better ratio than other health insurers in the state, whose ratios averaged 70 percent to 80 percent, and much better than the national average, said Timothy Jost, a professor at Washington and Lee University School of Law and a consultant for the National Association of Insurance Commissioners.\n\n\u201cAt the time the 80 percent ratio was adopted [under the ACA], most insurers were not far from that.\u201d Timothy Jost Consultant for the National Association of Insurance Commissioners\n\n\u201cThat strikes me as very low,\u201d Jost said of Aetna\u2019s medical loss ratios. \u201cAt the time the 80 percent ratio was adopted [under the ACA], most insurers were not far from that.\u201d\n\nAetna spokeswoman Susan Millerick said Aetna expected a medical loss ratio of 60 percent in its individual market for 2008 and a little higher in 2009. But those ratios never materialized because the recession kept people who were concerned about paying co-pays and deductibles from using medical services, she said.\n\nNevertheless, Aetna continued to request rate increases \u201con the assumption that the book of business might deteriorate,\u201d Millerick said. That means Aetna expected its healthier customers to shop for a more favorable rate over time, leaving a less healthy risk pool in its individual market, Millerick said. But that never happened because the company continued to sign up new healthy customers who had been screened by the company for pre-existing conditions and other factors that might make them bad risks.\n\nMillerick said the gains Aetna made selling individual policies in Connecticut were \u201cnot typical,\u201d but welcomed. \u201cIf the Connecticut experience occurred in other markets, we would not be leaving other markets,\u201d Millerick said.\n\nApproval almost every time\n\nAlthough individual health insurance policies still represent only a fraction of Aetna\u2019s business in Connecticut, the market has exploded in the past five years. The company earned about $6.8 million from these policies in 2007 -- a figure that swelled to $59 million by 2012.\n\n\u201cWe believe this growth reflects that our products were well-priced and attractive \u2026,\u201d Susan Millerick Aetna spokeswoman\n\nMillerick said the rates the company charged were competitive, as evidenced by its rapid growth in the individual market -- from 2,600 policyholders in 2006 to 32,000 today.\n\n\u201cWe believe this growth reflects that our products were well-priced and attractive \u2026,\u201d she said.\n\nBut others say insurers like Aetna were able to lower their medical loss ratios by selling policies with high co-pays and deductibles that dissuaded people from seeking medical help and by putting other limits on care.\n\n\u201cThe less money you put into medical care, the more money you have for overhead, bonuses\u2026and profits,\u201d said Blake Hutson of Consumers Union.\n\nDespite the company\u2019s favorable medical loss ratios, the Connecticut Department of Insurance continued to approve the rate increases Aetna requested.\n\nThe records that are available \u2013 the Department of Insurance says it has destroyed all records filed before 2007 to comply with state recordkeeping statutes -- show state regulators never rejected a rate increase request for the policies Aetna sold to individuals in Connecticut.\n\nThe company asked for five rate increases on individual policies from 2009 to 2013. Only once, in March 2010, did state regulators modify a rate increase request of 15 percent by Aetna --- approving only an 8 percent hike.\n\n\u201cIt is outrageous that a big company like Aetna would spend that small amount of premium dollars on medical costs and still have the audacity to ask for rate increases year after year,\u201d said Wendell Potter, a health policy consultant who worked for Cigna for 15 years, part of that time at the insurer\u2019s Bloomfield offices.\n\nThe ACA forced Aetna to close the big gap it had enjoyed between premiums earned and claims paid out, requiring the company to pay rebates to its customers for overcharges.\n\n\u201cI thank God for the [ACA\u2019s] medical loss ratio which provides protection to consumers,\u201d U.S. Rep. Joe Courtney Connecticut congressman, District 2\n\nRep. Joe Courtney, D-2nd District, a strong supporter of the Affordable Care Act, said the health care law\u2019s reforms were way overdue because they gave state insurance departments strict guidelines to control rates on health care policies.\n\n\u201cI thank God for the [ACA\u2019s] medical loss ratio which provides protection to consumers,\u201d Courtney said. \u201cThe new law will mean the end of the bad old days.\u201d\n\nCourtney said before the ACA established strict medical loss ratios \u201cdouble digit rate increases were kind of par for the course.\u201d\n\nPotter testified at a Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation hearing last week that aimed to determine how well the ACA\u2019s restrictions on medical loss ratios are working.\n\nHe said Wall Street pressured insurers to have a large gap between premiums and medical expenses because they assess the financial health of a company by the direction that the medical loss ratio is going year after year.\n\n\u201cI once saw a competitor\u2019s stock price drop 20 percent in a single day when the company reported that its [medical loss ratio] for the quarter had increased by just one and a half percent,\u201d he said.\n\nBut now that all insurers must abide by the limitations of the ACA, \u201cthe perception of [insurers] on Wall Street has been more positive than before,\u201d said committee chairman Sen. John Rockefeller, D-W-Va.\n\nNo standard\n\nOne reason Aetna had such a good medical loss ratio is that the standard the state used to evaluate Aetna\u2019s rate increase request, was, in fact, no standard at all.\n\nBefore the ACA set its 80-85 percent rule, the state\u2019s insurance department said it based its decisions on rate increase requests by following the National Association of Insurance Commissioner\u2019s \u201cmodel guidelines\u201d that set a standard of a 55/45 medical loss ratio.\n\nPaul Lombardo was the chief actuary at the department who signed off on many rate increases.\n\n\u201cPrior to the Affordable Care Act, we did not have any statutes or regulations concerning medical loss ratios,\u201d Lombardo said. \u201cBut we followed the NAIC guidelines.\u201d\n\nThe NAIC had guidance for a medical loss ratio of 55/45, but that was considered a floor or a minimum given the benefits provided. But this was not considered an exact target.\n\nJost, the consultant to the NAIC, said the 55 percent number may have come up at a conference as the absolute floor when it comes to medical loss ratios.\n\n\u201cThat was an absolute minimum,\u201d Jost said. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t what we were expecting and it is really serious if an insurer hit that number.\u201d\n\nSteve Ostlund, head of the Health Actuarial Task Force for the NAIC, agrees.\n\n\u201cFifty-five percent was like the minimum. That was not a recommendation.\u201d Steve Ostlund Head of the NAIC Health Actuarial Task Force\n\nThe NAIC \u201cwould never set a standard that low,\u201d said Ostlund. He is life and health actuary for Alabama\u2019s department of insurance and the NAIC\u2019s expert on medical loss ratios. \u201cFifty-five percent was like the minimum. That was not a recommendation.\u201d\n\nLombardo said the Connecticut Insurance Department reviewed an insurer\u2019s past claims experience and projected trends in determining whether the company deserved a rate hike. But he said the process was inexact, resulting in \u201ca lot of crystal ball gazing\u201d in predicting how many claims a company would have to pay in the future.\n\n\u201cFor a company to expect a certain [medical loss ratio] and actually get that is unheard of,\u201d Lombardo said.\n\nLombardo said Aetna\u2019s rates were appropriate. What happened, he said, is that Aetna was lucky in having fewer claims than expected, perhaps a result of its growing business.\n\n\u201cWhen you get new customers, you get a population that is healthier,\u201d he said.\n\nMickey Herbert, former president and CEO of ConnectiCare, and now a consultant for the Massachusetts insurer Harvard Pilgrim, said Aetna isn\u2019t much of a risk taker and was trying to improve its financial health by raising as much money in premium dollars as it could.\n\n\u201cThey are a conservative company,\u201d he said.\n\nHerbert also said \u201cactuarial projections are a bit of a crapshoot\u201d and he could not fault the Connecticut Insurance Department for erring on the low side in its predictions of Aetna\u2019s future claim expenses.\n\n\u201cThe worst thing that could happen to a department of insurance is for a company to fail,\u201d he said.\n\nAetna had to downshift quickly after the ACA was approved in 2010.\n\nAbout six weeks after the ACA became law, to try to get closer to the 80 percent ratio, Aetna asked the Connecticut Insurance Department to allow it to lower its rates by 10 percent.\n\n\u201cAetna says it expects to pay rebates on these plans for 2011 and is trying to stabilize rates at a reasonable level over a period of years,\u201d said the insurance department in its decision to allow the decrease.\n\nDonna Tommelleo, spokeswoman for the Connecticut Insurance Department, said the agency\u2019s current commissioner, Thomas Leonardi, had nothing to do with the agency\u2019s practice of using a 55 percent medical loss ratio as a guideline.\n\n\u201cThe NAIC model law predated Commissioner Leonardi. By the time he was appointed commissioner in 2011, the ACA medical loss ratio of 80/85 percent was the law,\u201d Tommelleo said.\n\nLike most state insurance departments, Connecticut\u2019s agency is funded by an assessment on every insurance company that does business in the state, based on premium dollars collected.\n\nAccording to the NAIC, the Connecticut Insurance Department\u2019s budget will be $27 million this year. Even though Connecticut is a small state, the NAIC ranked it 20th among all states and the District of Columbia in the amount of premiums insurers collected from customers in 2012, about $30 billion.\n\nAetna issues rebates\n\nUnder the ACA, Aetna was forced to issue more than $2.1 million in rebates in 2012 for policies that were in effect the year before. It continued to miss the 80/20 loss ratio and was forced to pay more than $1 million last year in rebates to individuals who held Aetna policies in 2012. Aetna was also required to issue rebates in 16 other states this year.\n\nAetna was not the only company that has had to issue rebates to customers because of problems with medical loss ratios.\n\nConnectiCare was required to issue more than $1.3 million in rebates to individuals who purchased their plans in 2011 and nearly $4.3 million in rebates to companies who purchased small groups plans in 2012.\n\n\u201cIn certain business segments, ConnectiCare Insurance Company Incorporated experienced lower medical expenses in 2011 and 2012 than assumed in pricing,\u201d said company spokeswoman Jenna Hagist.\n\nConnectiCare was required to issue rebates because its medical loss ratio for small group health plans was 75.4 percent in 2011 and the medical loss ratio for individual health plans was 73.2 percent in 2011, Hagist said.\n\nOther insurers issued rebates, too, and these went to businesses and even government entities that purchased group policies. The town of Vernon, for instance, received a $169,852 rebate check last year from Cigna for a group policy for city employees.\n\nAn official from the Centers for Medicaid & Medicare Services said that in 2011, 24.5 percent of health insurance companies failed to meet the required standard in at least one market. But no one issued more rebates in Connecticut than Aetna and ConnectiCare.\n\nCMS is expected to issue its latest medical loss ratio report in June. That will determine whether Aetna, and other Connecticut health insurers, will have to cut new rebate checks to customers because they continue to have poor medical loss ratios.\n\nAetna was one of several insurance companies that protested the Department of Health and Human Service\u2019s regulations concerning medical loss ratios when they were posted in January of 2011.\n\n\u201cFirst and foremost, it is important to recognize that imposing an MLR does not make premiums more affordable,\u201d wrote Steven Kelmar, an Aetna lobbyist. \u201cWe are very concerned that a minimum MLR could have the counterproductive impact of increasing premiums.\u201d\n\nKelmar said the new regulations would strip Aetna of money to invest in fraud prevention and other procedures that would \u201cimprove quality and constrain cost.\u201d\n\nIn 2012, the company spent $7 million supporting conservative groups that opposed the ACA.\n\nThe company also backed out of plans to participate in insurance exchanges in Connecticut, Maryland and other states when it determined the premiums it would be allowed to charge might not bring in enough money. In its Connecticut filing, Aetna said the rates for individual policies in the exchange should be raised by 20 percent to account for \u201cpent up\u201d medical needs of people in poor health who were previously uninsured.\n\nBut, in this case, the Connecticut Insurance Department questioned Aetna\u2019s numbers and projections.\n\nAetna then announced it was not interested in participating in the Connecticut exchange, Access Health CT.\n\nCourtney said there was a lot of concern among consumer advocates in Connecticut that the department of insurance did not negotiate rates with the insurers who are offering policies in the exchange, ConnectiCare, Anthem Blue Cross & Blue Shield, United Health and HealthyCT.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re at a point right now where the rates are done, and it\u2019s kind of a mixed bag,\u201d Courtney said.\n\nDespite its decision to stay out of Access Health CT, Aetna plans to continue to sell policies to individuals in Connecticut.\n\nIt asked the Connecticut Insurance Department to approve another rate hike -- in the amount of 8.75 percent -- for individual policies the company is selling in the state this year.\n\nAetna said it needed to raise rates to cover the cost of complying with the ACA\u2019s requirement that insurance policies offer \u201cessential benefits,\u201d including maternity care, and mental health and prescription coverage.\n\nThe department of insurance approved the increase.\n\nReporting for this story was made possible by the Fund for Investigative Journalism.\n\nEditor's note: A clarification of medical loss ratio and profits has been included to help readers better understand the connection.", "article_metadata": {"standout": "http://ctmirror.org/2014/05/27/state-regulators-did-little-to-curb-aetna-rate-hikes/", "news_keywords": "Health Care, Aetna, Affordable Care Act, Blake Hutson, connecticare, Connecticut Department of Insurance, Consumers Union, Obamacare, Rep.
