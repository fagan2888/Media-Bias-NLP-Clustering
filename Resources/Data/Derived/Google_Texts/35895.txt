BRET BAIER: You are one of the senators leading an alternative to Obamacare, putting it out. It's a framework, though. It's not real chock-full of specifics. Can you break it down for us?



SEN. RICHARD BURR (R-NC): Yeah, we've put out a draft that we've solicited the best and the brightest to comment on it and make changes. But what it does is it repeals Obamacare. It sets up a fundamental framework which is financially sustainable into the future. We address those low-income Americans with targeted tax credits for the individual or for the family. We address changes like tort reform and things that have been cost increasers in the system. We actually go in and say to Medicaid beneficiaries, individuals on state Medicaid plans, listen, if Medicaid doesn't work for you, we'll give you the tax credit, and you can go in the private marketplace and buy in a competitive insurance marketplace and be like everybody else. We don't treat them as second-class citizens.



BAIER: Pre-conditions?



BURR: Pre-conditions. As long as they stay insured after the open period, there's no plan that could ever drop them or raise their rate because of an illness.



BAIER: Do you think Republicans rally around one alternative before the end of this Congress?



BURR: I don't think so. I think that there are going to be a lot of ideas not only in Congress but around the think tanks here in Washington and around the country. But I do say this, we're going to know a lot more after the Supreme Court hears the King v. Burwell case, and that's going to be a short-term interim response. The long-term is, how do we revamp this in 2017 and after so it works for America's patients?
