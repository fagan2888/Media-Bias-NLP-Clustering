The gauntlet thrown down to Russia is unprecedented. So naturally the reaction is in line with this threat.\"\n\nPresident Tayyip Erdogan has said Turkey will not apologize for downing the jet, but he said on Saturday that the incident had saddened him and that the climate change summit in Paris next week could be a chance to repair relations with Moscow.\n\n\"Confrontation will not bring anyone happiness. As much as Russia is important for Turkey, Turkey is important for Russia,\" Erdogan said in a televised speech in the western city of Baliksehir.\n\nPeskov said Putin was aware of a Turkish request for him to meet Erdogan on the sidelines of the Paris conference but gave no indication of whether such a meeting would take place.\n\nPeskov denied Turkish press reports which said Moscow and Ankara had struck a deal for their warplanes to stop flying along the Syrian-Turkish border, saying military ties between the two countries had been severed and a hot line meant to avoid misunderstandings among their pilots dismantled.\n\nPeskov, according to the TASS news agency, also spoke of how Erdogan's son had a \"certain interest\" in the oil industry. Putin has said oil from Syrian territory controlled by Islamic State militants is finding its way to Turkey.\n\nErdogan has spoken of slander and asked anyone making such accusations to back up their words with evidence.\n\nPeskov said he \"noted\" that Turkey's newly-appointed energy minister, Berat Albayrak, was Erdogan's son-in-law.\n\nHe added that there could be up to 200,000 Turkish citizens on Russian soil. \"What's important is that everyone who is able to use their influence to guarantee at least some predictability in the pattern of Turkey's behavior,\" Peskov said.\n\n\"Russian planes should never be shot down.\"\n\n(Additional reporting by Yesim Dikmen in Istanbul, Tulay Karadeniz and Dasha Afanasieva in Ankara; Editing by Dominic Evans)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "MOSCOW (Reuters) - President Vladimir Putin is fully mobilized to tackle what the Krem", "title": "Kremlin says Putin 'fully mobilized' to tackle threat from Turkey", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2015/11/28/Kremlin-says-Putin-fully-mobilized-tackle-threat-Turkey", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/mideast-crisis-russia-turkey_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2015/11/28/Kremlin-says-Putin-fully-mobilized-tackle-threat-Turkey", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/mideast-crisis-russia-turkey_1.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "MOSCOW (Reuters) - President Vladimir Putin is fully mobilized to tackle what the Krem", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "\"The president is mobilized, fully mobilized, mobilized to the extent that circumstances demand,\" said Peskov.\nAs much as Russia is important for Turkey, Turkey is important for Russia,\" Erdogan said in a televised speech in the western city of Baliksehir.\nMOSCOW (Reuters) - President Vladimir Putin is fully mobilized to tackle what the Kremlin regards as an unprecedented threat from Turkey following the shooting down of one of its warplanes by a Turkish F-16, the Russian leader's spokesman said on Saturday.\nPutin has said oil from Syrian territory controlled by Islamic State militants is finding its way to Turkey.\nPeskov said the crisis had prompted Putin, whose ministers are preparing retaliatory economic measures against Turkey, to \"mobilize\" in the way an army does in tense times."}
