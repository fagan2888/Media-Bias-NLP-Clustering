Also on Tuesday, NCRM offered a 10-second clip of the \"Mama Grizzly's\" speech that perfectly summed up the surreal experience.\n\nBut like Mount Everest, we're offering you the opportunity to experience in its entirety, all 20 minutes or so, of the mind-numbing inanity that is the Sarah Palin speech.\n\nBehold, a word salad like no other.\n\nAnd remember, this is America's Republican Party.\n\nFull video, full text below:\n\n\u201cThank you so much it\u2019s great to be in Iowa! We\u2019re here just thawing out. Todd and I and a couple of our friends here from Alaska, ah, lending our support for the next president of our great United States of America, Donald J. Trump.\n\n\u201cMr. Trump, you\u2019re right, look back there in the press box! Heads are spinning, media heads are spinning. This is gonna be so much fun!\n\n\u201cAre you ready to make America great again? We all have a part in this. We all have a responsibility. Looking around at all of you, you hard-working Iowa families. You farm families, and teachers, and teamsters, and cops, and cooks. You rockin\u2019 rollers. And holy rollers! All of you who work so hard. You full-time moms. You with the hands that rock the cradle. You all make the world go round, and now our cause is one.\n\n\u201cWhen asked why I would jump in into a primary \u2014 kind of stirring it up a little bit, maybe \u2014 and choose one over some friends who are running and I\u2019ve endorsed a couple others in their races before they decided to run for President, I was told, you know warned left and right, \u201cyou are going to get so clobbered in the press. You are just going to get beat up, and chewed up, and spit out.\u201d You know, I\u2019m thinking, \u201cand\u2026?\u201d You know, like you guys haven\u2019t tried to do that every day since that night in 2008, when I was on stage nominated for VP [Vice President], and I got to say, \u201cyeah, I\u2019ll go, send me, you betcha. I\u2019ll serve.\u201d And, like you all, I\u2019m still standing. So those of us who\u2019ve kind of gone through the ringer as Mr. Trump has, it makes me respect you even more. That you\u2019re here, and you\u2019re putting your efforts and you\u2019re putting reputations, you are putting relationships on the line to do the right thing for this country. Because you are ready to make America great again!\n\n\u201cWell, I am here because like you I know that it is now or never. I\u2019m in it to win it because we believe in America, and we love our freedom. And if you love your freedom, thank a vet. Thank a vet, and know that the United States military deserves a commander-in-chief who loves our country passionately, and will never apologise for this country. A new commander-in-chief who will never leave our men behind. A new commander-in-chief, one who will never lie to the families of the fallen. I\u2019m in it, because just last week, we\u2019re watching our sailors suffer and be humiliated on a world stage at the hands of Iranian captors in violation of international law, because a weak-kneed, capitulator-in-chief has decided that America will lead from behind. And he, who would negotiate deals, kind of with the skills of a community organiser maybe organising a neighbourhood tea, well, he deciding that, \u201cNo, America would apologise and, as part of the deal,\u201d as the enemy sends a message to the rest of the world that they capture and we kowtow, and we apologise, and then, we bend over and say, \u201cThank you, enemy.\u201d We are ready for a change. We are ready and our troops deserve the best. A new commander-in-chief whose track record of success has proven he is the master at the art of the deal. He is one who would know to negotiate.\n\n\u201cOnly one candidate\u2019s record of success proves he is the master of the art of the deal. He is beholden to no one, but we the people, how refreshing. He is perfectly positioned to let you make America great again. Are you ready for that, Iowa?\n\n\u201cNo more pussy footin\u2019 around! Our troops deserve the best, you deserve the best!\n\n\u201cHe is from the private sector - not a politician, can I get a \u201cHallelujah!\u201d Where, in the private sector, you actually have to balance budgets in order to prioritise, to keep the main thing, the main thing, and he knows the main thing: a president is to keep us safe economically and militarily. He knows the main thing, and he knows how to lead the charge. So troops, hang in there, because help\u2019s on the way because he, better than anyone, isn\u2019t he known for being able to command, fire? Are you ready for a commander-in-chief, you ready for a commander-in-chief who will let our warriors do their job and go kick Isis ass? Ready for someone who will secure our borders, to secure our jobs, and to secure our homes? Ready to make America great again, are you ready to stump for Trump? I\u2019m here to support the next president of the United States, Donald Trump.\n\n\u201cNow, eight years ago, I warned that Obama\u2019s promised fundamental transformation of America. that is was going to take more from you, and leave America weaker on the world stage. And that we would soon be unrecognisable. Well, it\u2019s the one promise that Obama kept. But he didn\u2019t do it alone, and this is important to remember, especially those of you, like me, a member of the GOP, this is what we have to remember, in this very contested, competitive, great primary race.\n\nTrump\u2019s candidacy, it has exposed not just that tragic, the ramifications of that betrayal of the transformation of our country, but too, he has exposed the complicity on both sides of the aisle that has enabled it, okay? Well, Trump, what he\u2019s been able to do, which is really ticking people off, which I\u2019m glad about, he\u2019s going rogue left and right, man, that\u2019s why he\u2019s doing so well. He\u2019s been able to tear the veil off this idea of the system. The way that the system really works, and please hear me on this, I want you guys to understand more and more how the system, the establishment, works, and has gotten us into the troubles that we are in in America. The permanent political class has been doing the bidding of their campaign donor class, and that\u2019s why you see that the borders are kept open. For them, for their cheap labor that they want to come in. That\u2019s why they\u2019ve been bloating budgets. It\u2019s for crony capitalists to be able suck off of them. It\u2019s why we see these lousy trade deals that gut our industry for special interests elsewhere. We need someone new, who has the power, and is in the position to bust up that establishment, to make things great again. It\u2019s part of the problem.\n\n\u201cHis candidacy, which is a movement - it\u2019s a force, it\u2019s a strategy. It proves, as long as the politicos, they get to keep their titles, and their perks, and their media ratings, they don\u2019t really care who wins elections. Believe me on this. And the proof of this? Look what\u2019s happening today. Our own GOP machine, the establishment, they who would assemble the political landscape, they\u2019re attacking their own frontrunner. Now would the Left ever, would the DNC ever come after their frontrunner and her supporters? No \u2018cause they don\u2019t eat their own, they don\u2019t self-destruct. But for the GOP establishment to be coming after Donald Trump\u2019s supporters even, with accusations that are so false. They are so busted, the way that this thing works. We, you, a diverse, dynamic, needed support base that they would attack. And now, some of them even whispering, they\u2019re ready to throw in for Hillary over Trump because they can\u2019t afford to see the status quo go, otherwise, they won\u2019t be able to be slurping off the gravy train that\u2019s been feeding them all these years. They don\u2019t want that to end.\n\n\u201cWell, and then, funny, ha ha, not funny. But now, what they\u2019re doing is wailing, \u2018well, Trump and his, uh, uh, uh, Trumpeters, they\u2019re not conservative enough.\u2019 Oh my goodness gracious. What the heck would the establishment know about conservatism? Tell me, is this conservative? GOP majorities handing Obama a blank check to fund Obamacare and Planned Parenthood and illegal immigration that competes for your jobs, and turning safety nets into hammocks, and all these new Democrat voters that are going to be coming on over border as we keep the borders open, and bequeathing our children millions in new debt, and refusing to fight back for our solvency, and our sovereignty, even though that\u2019s why we elected them and sent them as a majority to DC. No! If they\u2019re not willing to do that, then how are they to tell us that we\u2019re not conservative enough in order to be able to make these changes in America that we know need to be made. Now they\u2019re concerned about this ideological purity? Give me a break! Who are they to say that? Oh tell somebody like, Phyllis Schlafly, she is the Republican, conservative movement icon and hero and a Trump supporter. Tell her she\u2019s not conservative. How \u2018bout the rest of us? Right wingin\u2019, bitter clingin\u2019, proud clingers of our guns, our god, and our religions, and our Constitution. Tell us that we\u2019re not red enough? Yeah, coming from the establishment. Right.\n\n\u201cWell, he being the only one who\u2019s been willing, he\u2019s got the guts to wear the issues that need to be spoken about and debate on his sleeve, where the rest of some of these establishment candidates, they just wanted to duck and hide. They didn\u2019t want to talk about these issues until he brought them up. In fact, they\u2019ve been wearing a, this, um, political correctness kind of like a suicide vest. And enough is enough. These issues that Donald Trump talks about had to be debated. And he brought them to the forefront. And that\u2019s why we are where we are today with good discussion. A good, heated, and very competitive primary is where we are. And now though, to be lectured that, \u201cwell, you guys are all sounding kind of angry,\u201d is what we\u2019re hearing from the establishment. Doggone right we\u2019re angry! Justifiably so! Yes! You know, they stomp on our neck, and then they tell us, \u201cJust chill, okay just relax.\u201d Well, look, we are mad, and we\u2019ve been had. They need to get used to it.\n\n\u201cThis election is more than just your basic ABCs, anybody but Clinton. It\u2019s more than that this go-around. When we\u2019re talking about a nation without borders. When we\u2019re talking about bankruptcies in our federal government. Debt that our children and our grandchildren, they\u2019ll never be able to pay off. When we\u2019re talking about no more Reaganesque power that comes from strength. Power through strength. Well, then, we\u2019re talking about our very existence, so no, we\u2019re not gonna chill. In fact it\u2019s time to drill, baby, drill down, and hold these folks accountable. And we need to stop the self-sabotage and elect new, and independent, a candidate who represents that and represents America first, finally. Pro-Constitution, common-sense solutions, that he brings to the table. Yes the status quo has got to go. Otherwise we\u2019re just going to get more of the same, and with their failed agenda, it can\u2019t be salvaged. It must be savaged. And Donald Trump is the right one to do that.\n\n\u201cAre you ready for new? And are you ready for the leader who will let you make America great again? It\u2019s gonna take a whole team. It\u2019s gonna take a whole team. Fighters, all of us, in the private sector. Fighters in the House and the Senate. So, our friends, who are fighters in the House and the Senate today, they need to stay there and help out. They can help our new leader in the positions that they are in.\n\n\u201cLet me say something really positive about one of those individuals: Rand Paul. I\u2019m going to tell you about that libertarian streak in him that is healthy, because he knows, you only go to war if you\u2019re determined to win the war! And you quit footin\u2019 the bill for these nations who are oil-rich, we\u2019re paying for some of their squirmishes that have been going on for centuries. Where they\u2019re fighting each other and yelling 'Allah Akbar' calling Jihad on each other\u2019s heads for ever and ever. Like I\u2019ve said before, let them duke it out and let Allah sort it out. We\u2019ll fight for American interests, and as Donald Trump has said, other nations where we have been footing the bill, but we haven\u2019t prioritised our own domestic budgets well enough to be able to afford what we\u2019re doing overseas. Things are gonna change under President Trump.\n\n\u201cSo it can be an unbeatable team with fighters there in the House and the Senate. Yeah, our leader is a little bit different. He\u2019s a multi-billionaire. Not that there\u2019s anything wrong with that. But, it\u2019s amazing, he is not elitist at all. Oh, I just hope you all get to know him more and more as a person, and a family man. What he\u2019s been able to accomplish, with his um, it\u2019s kind of this quiet generosity. Yeah, maybe his largess kind of, I don\u2019t know, some would say gets in the way of that quiet generosity, and, uh, his compassion, but if you know him as a person and you\u2019ll get to know him more and more, you\u2019ll have even more respect. Not just for his record of success, and the good intentions for America, but who he is as a person. He\u2019s not an elitist. And yes, as a multi-billionaire, we still root him on, because he roots us on. And he has, he\u2019s spent his life with the working man. And he tells us Joe six packs, he said, \u2018You know, I\u2019ve worked very, very hard. And I\u2019ve succeeded. Hugely I\u2019ve succeeded,\u2019 he says. And he says, \u2018I want you to succeed too.\u2019 And that is refreshing, because he, as he builds things, he builds big things, things that touch the sky, big infrastructure that puts other people to work. He has spent his life looking up and respecting the hard-hats and the steel-toed boots and the work ethic that you all have within you. He, being an optimist, passionate about equal opportunity to work. This self-made success of his, you know that he doesn\u2019t get his power, his high, off of OPM, other people\u2019s money, like a lot of dopes in Washington do. They\u2019re addicted to OPM, where they take other people\u2019s money, and then their high is getting to redistribute it, right? And then they get to be really popular people - when they get to give out your hard money. Well, he doesn\u2019t do that. His power, his passion, is the fabric of America. And it\u2019s woven by work ethic and dreams and drive and faith in the Almighty, what a combination.\n\n\u201cAre you ready to share in that again, Iowa? Because that\u2019s what\u2019s going to let you make America great again. He\u2019s going to be able to empower you to look out for one-another again instead of relying on bankrupt government to supposedly be looking out for you. No, and I think you\u2019re ready for that. And Iowa, I believe too that you\u2019re ready to see that our vets are treated better than illegal immigrants are treated in this country. You\u2019re ready for the tax reform he talks about to open up main street again. And you\u2019re ready to stop the race-baiting and the division based on colour, zip code, to unify around the right issues. The issues important to me, or I wouldn\u2019t be endorsing him. Pro-life, pro-Second Amendment, strict constitutionality. Those things that are unifying values and their time-tested truths involved. These are unifying values from big cities to tiny towns, from big mountain states and the Big Apple, to the big, beautiful heartland that is in between.\n\n\u201cNow, finally friends, I want you to try to picture this, it\u2019s a nice thing to picture. Exactly one year from tomorrow, former President Barack Obama. He packs up the teleprompters and the selfie-sticks, and the Greek columns, and all that hopey, changey stuff and he heads on back to Chicago, where I\u2019m sure he can find some community there to organise, again. There, he can finally look up, President Obama will be able to look up, and there, over his head, he\u2019ll be able to see that shining, towering, Trump tower. Yes, Barack, he built that and that says a lot. Iowa, you say a lot, being here tonight, supporting the right man who will allow you to make America great again. God bless you! God bless the United States of America and our next president of the United States, Donald J. Trump!\u201d\n\nTranscript via The Independent", "article_metadata": {"Description": "Palin Describes Conservatives As \"Right Wingin\u2019, Bitter Clingin\u2019, Proud Clingers Of Our Guns, Our God, And Our Religions\"", "Title": "'Right Wingin\u2019, Bitter Clingin\u2019': Palin's Speech Endorsing Trump, Full Text And Video", "csrf-token": "HXqW+rrKDhJ9BCa5FpAsiKOH97jheTO+itQZYyaXGhI=", "twitter": {"description": "Palin Describes Conservatives As", "creator": "davidbadash", "image": {"src": "http://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/thenewcivilrightsmovement/pages/15438/meta_images/original/palin_trump_2.jpg?1453297565"}, "title": "'Right Wingin\u2019, Bitter Clingin\u2019': Palin's Speech Endorsing Trump, Full Text And Video", "site": "@newcivilrights", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "csrf-param": "authenticity_token", "og": {"site_name": "The New Civil Rights Movement", "description": "Palin Describes Conservatives As \"Right Wingin\u2019, Bitter Clingin\u2019, Proud Clingers Of Our Guns, Our God, And Our Religions\"", "title": "'Right Wingin\u2019, Bitter Clingin\u2019': Palin's Speech Endorsing Trump, Full Text And Video", "url": "http://www.thenewcivilrightsmovement.com/davidbadash/_right_wingin_bitter_clingin_palin_s_speech_endorsing_trump_full_text_and_video", "image": "http://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/thenewcivilrightsmovement/pages/15438/meta_images/original/palin_trump_2.jpg?1453297565", "type": "article"}, "google-site-verification": "jP8OBaknsLrLrUReRa1iFj24dVZU6CQhTstvxQf6Mo8", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1823\"", "article_summary": "Iowa, you say a lot, being here tonight, supporting the right man who will allow you to make America great again.\nReady to make America great again, are you ready to stump for Trump?\nHe is perfectly positioned to let you make America great again.\nThings are gonna change under President Trump.\nBecause you are ready to make America great again!"}
