Marilinda Garcia is up 4 points\u201341/37 (with leaners)\u2013in a new Granite State poll from the University of New Hampshire. Still, 19 percent are undecided so there\u2019s room for both sides to maneuver and grow as the election heads into the final stretch.\n\nNeedless to say, the Kuster camp fired off this fundraising email upon hearing the news:\n\nLast night we got the results of the latest poll in our race. It shows that our opponent\u2019s puppet masters\u2019 - the Koch brothers - attack ads are working. Their relentless attacks on TV have erased our lead and made our race a pure toss up and a statistical dead heat. These next 27 days will determine what will happen on Election Day - the only day that matters \u2013 if we're up or we're down.\n\nMeanwhile, former Rep. Charlie Bass has endorsed Garcia.\n\n\u201cNew Hampshire\u2019s 2nd Congressional District deserves an independent Representative who upholds our Granite State traditions of meeting with citizens and being accessible to the public. Marilinda Garcia will be that Representative, and I am proud to endorse her campaign for Congress,\u201d said Bass. \u201cMarilinda is an honest, responsible, and principled leader, and her commitment to common sense fiscal discipline would best serve the people of New Hampshire.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs an esteemed legislator who served the 2nd district admirably for nearly two decades, former Congressman Bass understands what is needed to deal with the important issues facing our district,\u201d said Garcia in a statement. \u201cI am honored that he has placed his faith in my candidacy and has endorsed my campaign for Congress.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee has hit Garcia on education with an ad staring a \u201cNew Hampshire Teacher\u201d detailing the evil Tea Party plans she has in store for the state\u2019s residents.\n\nWhile Garcia says that Obamacare is burdening families and new solutions to fix health care are needed.\n\nNevertheless, while this is only one poll showing Garcia in the lead, it's a sign that maybe Kuster should have emerged from the bunker more visibly than one month before Election Day.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Good news..05/25/2016 20:20:35PM EST.", "author": "Matt Vespa", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Good news.", "title": "Matt Vespa - Poll: Garcia Up 4 Points Over Incumbent Democrat", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/mattvespa/2014/10/09/poll-garcia-up-4-points-over-incumbent-democrat-n1902608", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/uploads/2014/10/8/6.png", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Good news.", "title": "Matt Vespa - Poll: Garcia Up 4 Points Over Incumbent Democrat", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/mattvespa/2014/10/09/poll-garcia-up-4-points-over-incumbent-democrat-n1902608", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/uploads/2014/10/8/6.png", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Poll: Garcia Up 4 Points Over Incumbent Democrat , Matt Vespa, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0963\"", "article_summary": "While New Hampshire\u2019s Second Congressional District went for Obama twice, State Rep.
