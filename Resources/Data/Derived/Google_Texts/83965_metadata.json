Peter J. Smith for The Wall Street Journal\n\nGreater New York starts the week on a sunny note, with several days of nice weather in the forecast before clouds and showers return on Thursday.\n\nHigh pressure makes an appearance over the tri-state area on Sunday night and stays in control through the middle of the week. This results in Monday\u2019s high temperatures staying right around normal, holding steady in the lower 80s under bright skies, making this a good day for the beach and other outdoor activities. Clouds may start to move in during the late afternoon and evening, but this activity will not lead to any sort of significant cloud cover. Overnight lows should stay seasonable as well, ranging from the upper 60s in New York City to right around 60 degrees in Orange County, N.Y.\n\nThe sun will shine again on Tuesday and Wednesday, accompanied by light winds and highs in the lower 80s. With August more than half over, there\u2019s still no sign of the heat that tends to pervade the region at this time of year. Mid-August highs are usually in the lower and middle 80s; temperatures are expected to remain at or slightly below normal this week, with highs in the upper 70s and lower 80s. But, the long-range forecast indicates that the last week of August may feature a few days of highs in the upper 80s and possibly the low 90s.\n\nMonday\u2019s Greater New York forecast roundup:\n\nWSJ Headquarters in Manhattan:\n\nActual High: 82; RealFeel High: 87\n\nActual Low: 68; RealFeel Low: 66\n\nWeather: Mostly sunny\n\nBrooklyn: 84/70\n\nQueens: 82/68\n\nBronx: 83/70\n\nStaten Island: 84/70\n\nPoughkeepsie, N.Y.: 79/59\n\nTrenton, N.J.: 81/65\n\nIslip, Long Island: 81/65\n\nNew Haven, Conn.: 82/64\n\nRebecca Fowler is a science writer at Columbia University\u2019s Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "Greater New York starts the week on a sunny note, with several days of nice weather in the forecast before clouds and showers return on Thursday.", "title": "New York Will See Nice Weather Early This Week", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2014/08/17/new-york-will-see-nice-weather-early-this-week/", "image": {"src": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-ED452_nyweat_P_20140817185033.jpg"}, "site": "WSJNY", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "New York", "article.headline": "New York Will See Nice Weather Early This Week", "description": "Greater New York starts the week on a sunny note, with several days of nice weather in the forecast before clouds and showers return on Thursday.", "article_section": "New York", "author": "Rebecca Fowler", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "testkeys": "C", "article.page": "Metropolis Blog", "page.subsection": "Metropolis", "article.summary": "Greater New York starts the week on a sunny note, with several days of nice weather in the forecast before clouds and showers return on Thursday.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "page.content.format": "responsive", "article.published": "2014-08-17T22:51:19-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-161", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2014/08/17/new-york-will-see-nice-weather-early-this-week/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-METROB-21424", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "New York", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "Greater New York starts the week on a sunny note, with several days of nice weather in the forecast before clouds and showers return on Thursday.", "title": "New York Will See Nice Weather Early This Week", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2014/08/17/new-york-will-see-nice-weather-early-this-week/", "image": {"width": 749, "identifier": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-ED452_nyweat_P_20140817185033.jpg", "height": 499}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Metropolis", "article.id": "BL-METROB-21424", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2014-08-17T22:51:19-04:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdac6a\"", "article_summary": "Peter J.
