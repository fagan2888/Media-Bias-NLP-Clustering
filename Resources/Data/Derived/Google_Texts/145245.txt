BEAVER CREEK — If not for changing light conditions Saturday, Ted Ligety might well be celebrating his second World Cup podium in super-G.

Ligety finished fifth, 0.48 of a second behind the winner, Patrick Kueng of Switzerland. Otmar Striedinger of Austria was second, 0.24 of a second behind Kueng, with Hannes Reichelt of Austria and Peter Fill of Italy sharing third.

Most of the top racers, including Ligety, ran while light was flat, making it difficult for them to read terrain hurtling toward them at more than 50 mph. Ligety was sitting in third place, 0.10 of a second behind Reichelt and Fill, until visibility began to improve. Kueng came down wearing bib No. 28 and bumped Ligety off the podium. Then Striedinger, running 45th and ranked 48th in the world in the discipline, slipped ahead of Reichelt and Fill.

“In every race, if the light gets a little bit better, it can be up to a second difference,” said Ligety, who will be the favorite in Sunday’s giant slalom. “That definitely played a big role. You saw from 25 on, guys got really fast all of a sudden. That’s the sport. I felt like I skied well for when I had to go. It would have been nice to have been on the podium, but I feel like I skied pretty well for the most part.”

Bode Miller went second, racing not only in flat light but without the benefit of a course report, and finished 14th. It was another positive step in his attempt to come back after a year away from the sport at age 36, and Miller said he’s “pretty close” to the peak of his ability.

“There’s three really blind turns there that are pretty nasty at high speed at the top, and I hit all three of them within a foot of where I wanted to be, at full speed,” Miller said. “For me, that’s really encouraging.”
