That enormous spending bill is being worked out as Congress slides toward a deadline of Friday, when much of the federal government\u2019s funding runs out.\n\n\u201cIf you want to be involved in the exchanges and you lose money, the American taxpayer should not have to bail you out,\u201d Mr. Rubio said on the Senate floor on Thursday.\n\nA White House spokeswoman, Katie Hill, declined to offer the administration\u2019s position on proposals that she said were still theoretical. \u201cWe are not going to weigh in on the possible inclusion of proposals floated by members of Congress\u201d in potential legislation, she said.\n\nCongress established the program in 2010 to protect insurers against the uncertainties they faced in setting the level of insurance premiums when they did not know who would sign up for coverage under the Affordable Care Act. Under the law, the federal government shares risk with insurers, limiting their gains and losses on insurance sold in the public marketplaces from 2014 through 2016. If consumer payments to an insurer exceed the company\u2019s medical expenses by a certain amount, the insurer pays some of that profit to the government. But if premium payments fall short of medical expenditures by a certain amount, the insurer is eligible for payments from the government.\n\nThe hope was that payments into the program would be in balance with payments out, shielding taxpayers from responsibility.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Rubio latched on to the issue in late 2013, recognizing not only the importance of risk corridors to the operation of the Affordable Care Act but also the political potency of a program he labeled crony capitalism \u2014 putting taxpayers \u201con the hook for Washington\u2019s mistakes,\u201d as he said when he reintroduced his risk corridor bill in January.\n\nThe \u201cbailouts\u201d of big banks and other financial firms during the economic crisis of 2008 and the rescue of the Big Three automakers that year and the next remain politically unpopular.\n\nThen the numbers rolled in from the insurance exchanges\u2019 first year of operation: Losses were so steep that insurance-company requests for risk corridor payments were $2.9 billion, compared with only $362 million paid into the program by profitable plans.\n\nMr. Rubio says he \u201csaved taxpayers $2.5 billion\u201d \u2014 the difference between those two amounts \u2014 because his measure prevented the government from using other sources of money for the risk corridor payments.\n\nThe administration has repeatedly told insurers that it will explore other funding sources to keep its commitment to companies losing money in the exchanges, but Mr. Rubio effectively tied the hands of federal health officials this year.\n\nLike many other observers of the health law, the Obama administration initially failed to appreciate the impact of the Rubio restrictions. Kevin J. Counihan, the chief executive of the federal insurance marketplace, told state officials in July that money collected from insurance companies would be \u201csufficient to pay for all risk corridor payments.\u201d More recently, the administration consoled insurers by telling them that it would make additional risk corridor payments from money collected in 2015 and 2016.\n\nBut in a new report, the credit ratings agency Standard & Poor\u2019s says that money will not be there.\n\nMr. Rubio says Mr. Obama compounded his problems by diverting risk corridor funds to quell a 2013 furor over canceled insurance policies. That year, the president announced that states could let insurers renew canceled plans and continue coverage for several years even if those policies did not meet the requirements of the federal health law.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nInsurers were shocked by the sudden change. They had set 2014 premiums on the assumption that healthy people with old insurance policies would move into the new marketplace, but Mr. Obama allowed many of them to stay out. In a letter to state insurance commissioners in November 2013, the administration said \u201cthe risk corridor program should help ameliorate unanticipated changes in premium revenue.\u201d\n\nFive days later, Mr. Rubio introduced his bill to kill the risk corridor program.\n\nInsurers now are lobbying to get more of the money they say they were promised, or to get relief in some other form.\n\nMr. Rubio has highlighted the role of Marilyn B. Tavenner, the former Obama administration official in charge of rolling out HealthCare.gov who is now president of the trade group America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans.\n\n\u201cThe former Obama administration official who led the rollout of Obamacare\u2019s exchanges and now runs the health insurance lobby is working with her White House allies to secure a new bailout by providing more funding for the law\u2019s risk corridor program,\u201d Mr. Rubio said last week.\n\nClare Krusing, a spokeswoman for the insurance group, said the federal payments were not a bailout for the industry, but a way of stabilizing the market and thus protecting consumers. \u201cWhen health plans cannot rely on the government to meet its obligations,\u201d she said, \u201cindividuals and families are harmed.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20151209050020, "twitter": {"description": "A provision slipped into a 2014 spending law by the Florida senator has tangled
