Jim DeMint (R-SC) as Reid\u2019s secret weapon, said if Republicans took back the Senate, it could turn into an \u201cAmerican idol of grievance.\u201d Todd snickered and egged Murphy on, showing nothing but contempt for conservatives.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\n\u201cHarry Reid may throw the Senate,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cYou can argue it\u2019s in his interest.\u201d\n\nIf Reid wanted to throw the Senate and become Minority Leader, he would have pushed Obama to enact a massive executive amnesty before the midterms. But Obama decided not to in order to preserve the Senate for Democrats. Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson, who gave Obama recommendations for executive actions, said that the administration delayed its executive amnesty to not get slaughtered at the polls like in the 1994 midterms. But Todd, who promised his viewers that he would stop the spin and hold establishment hacks and pundits to account, did not even mentions these points. Nor did he inform his viewers that Murphy advises Bush.\n\nAfter \u201cRepublican\u201d Joe Scarborough was at the the table for Todd\u2019s inaugural show, Murphy was the \u201cRepublican\u201d on the panel this week. It seems like the best way for a Republican to get on the program is to bash conservatives and volunteer to be the show\u2019s \u201cBrooklyn Brawler.\u201d But as Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) told Todd earlier on the program, Americans on the left and the right loathe the permanent political class and the establishment press for being out of touch. Todd and his panel again proved Sanders right.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Jeb Bush Adviser Mike Murphy: Throwing Senate to GOP in Harry Reid's Interest", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Jeb Bush Adviser Mike Murphy: Throwing Senate to GOP in Harry Reid's Interest", "title": "Jeb Bush Adviser Mike Murphy: Throwing Senate to GOP in Harry Reid's Interest - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Big-Government/2013/08/16/Mik-Murphy-Twitter.JPG", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2014/09/14/jeb-bush-adviser-mike-murphy-throwing-senate-to-gop-in-harry-reid-s-interest/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Jeb Bush Adviser Mike Murphy: Throwing Senate to GOP in Harry Reid's Interest", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Big-Government/2013/08/16/Mik-Murphy-Twitter.JPG", "title": "Jeb Bush Adviser Mike Murphy: Throwing Senate to GOP in Harry Reid's Interest - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "app_id": 1243316582352556, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Harry Reid, Jeb Bush, Senate,Big Government,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Big Government", "tag": "Senate", "published_time": "2014-09-14T19:36:00-07:00", "categories": "Big Government"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcccc5\"", "article_summary": "SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERJeb Bush adviser and GOP hack Mike Murphy thinks it may be in Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid\u2019s (D-NV) interest to throw the Senate to Republicans.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\u201cHarry Reid may throw the Senate,\u201d Murphy said.\nAfter \u201cRepublican\u201d Joe Scarborough was at the the table for Todd\u2019s inaugural show, Murphy was the \u201cRepublican\u201d on the panel this week.\nNor did he inform his viewers that Murphy advises Bush.\nBut Obama decided not to in order to preserve the Senate for Democrats."}
