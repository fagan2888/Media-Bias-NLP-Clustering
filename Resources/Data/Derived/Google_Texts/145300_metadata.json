Governor John Bel Edwards reversed the long-held position of his predecessor, Republican Bobby Jindal, who had rebuffed the Obama administration\u2019s overtures, which include a promise to cover the entire cost of expanding the government healthcare program for the first year, before tapering its contribution down to 90 percent by 2020.\n\nIt is that promise of \u201cfree\u201d money that the Obama administration hopes will win over the 19 states who continue to refuse to expand Medicaid to cover individuals up to 138 percent of the poverty level, including Alabama, where a task force appointed by Governor Robert Bentley voted late last year to recommend Medicaid expansion.\n\n\u201cThe White House is proposing new financial incentives to convert the remaining 19 states, like Alabama,\u201d said Debbie Elliot in a National Public Radio (NPR) report. \u201cThe Obama administration hopes to lure more states by offering money \u2014 three years of full funding for Medicaid expansion before the federal match tapers off.\u201d\n\nIt is a tempting proposition for state leaders, who find themselves eager to accept \u201cfree\u201d money from the federal government. Governor Bentley has expressed a desire to expand the program, but has not yet been able to make the numbers work.\n\n\u201c(Y)ou have to realize it is going to cost the state of Alabama over the next six years $710 million in the General Fund,\u201d Bentley said in November. \u201cNow folks, I can\u2019t even get (the Legislature) to raise a hundred million dollars. So we\u2019ve got to look at a funding stream if we\u2019re going to do it.\u201d\n\nThe head of the Alabama Medicaid Agency last week asked lawmakers for an additional $156 million in 2016, but was met with fierce opposition from Republicans, including Rep. Arnold Mooney (R-Birmingham) who insisted that Alabamians are \u201cnot going to put money into failing programs.\u201d\n\nOne of the main difficulties for states when it comes to Medicaid is that, because the federal government covers 70% of the cost of the program and mandates certain levels of coverage for enrollees, the state has essentially no control over the exploding costs.\n\nMedicaid is already the largest line item in Alabama\u2019s budget, comprising 37 percent of the General Fund. According to the Alabama Policy Institute, Alabama\u2019s Medicaid expenditures increased by 53% between 2001 and 2013. The state\u2019s Medicaid rolls eclipsed 1 million in 2010. In 2015, over 38,000 new enrollees became Medicaid recipients in a single year. More than one in four Alabamians is now enrolled in the government healthcare program, and as the state\u2019s senior population increases, costs are expected to grow even further.\n\nAlabama lawmakers are wary of expanding the program, not only because of their philosophical concerns, but also because they have experienced in recent years how taking \u201cfree\u201d money in the short term can put them in a bind a few years down the road.\n\nIn 2012, the Alabama legislature sought to patch a budget hole by borrowing $437 million from the state\u2019s oil and gas trust fund. When the funds ran out again last year, even typically anti-tax Republicans were ready to dip back into taxpayers\u2019 pockets to extract more revenue.\n\nA similar timeline could play out again, should GOP leaders give in to the Obama administration\u2019s Medicaid expansion overtures.\n\nThe legislature will convene the first week of February for the 2016 Regular Legislative Sessions.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Obama administration continues to offer \"free\" money to states who expand Medicaid", "og": {"site_name": "Yellowhammer News", "description": "Louisiana officially installed a new Democratic governor last week, and the first thing he did was expand Medicaid under ObamaCare.
