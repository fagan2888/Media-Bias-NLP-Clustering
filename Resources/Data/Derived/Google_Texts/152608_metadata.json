Darin LaHood, R-Peoria, who won a special election last fall.\n\nThe name is likely familiar to Democrats in the know. Rodriguez previously expressed interest in a bid for the seat in 2008 when U.S. Rep. Ray LaHood retired. That shot went to Colleen Callahan. Rodriguez mulled another shot last year after U.S. Rep. Aaron Schock resigned, but former student Adam Lopez was running in the primary, and he didn\u2019t want to run against someone he\u2019d taught.\n\nRodriguez casts himself a centrist Democrat, wanting to challenge the notion that the 18th is a \u201csolid red district,\u201d but rather one that is \u201cmuch more purple than it claims to be.\u201d He says he\u2019s also concerned at the notion that voters would look at someone who has held the seat for less than a term as one who has the powers of incumbency, arguing that LaHood still needs to prove himself to the citizenry given the low turnout in last September\u2019s special election.\n\nIn a year where political outsiders are admired, Rodriguez says he brings the best of both worlds, having dealt in compromise during his career while building working relationships, but at the same time teaching on matters including foreign policy and getting familiar with public service agencies.\n\n\u201cWhat I\u2019m asking people to do is to look at the totality of my life, the totality of my experience, what I bring to the table,\u201d he said during a wide-ranging phone interview. \u201cI also believe in the final analysis that if we have debates ... I can debate issues of policy.\u201d\n\nAnd our lengthy discussion suggested Rodriguez has some policy proposals that would generate discussion, including on working to improve the job-creation element of the Affordable Care Act. He\u2019d like to see more work at the community college level \u2014 even utilizing community facilities like libraries in small towns \u2014 to train folks for work in the electronic health record field.\n\nHis focus isn\u2019t just on the Peoria area either. Rodriguez told us he\u2019d like to work on partnerships with districts across the Mississippi River from the edge of the 18th in Quincy, working to expand Interstate 72 as an alternative east-west route for travel and shipping \u2014 improving business opportunities in communities along that corridor.\n\nThat\u2019s part of a trend, his desire to be \u201cthinking ahead to what\u2019s going to be in our interest five, 10, 30 years down the line\u201d rather than focusing on policies that only have appeal in the context of the next election.\n\nThe 18th has had a tendency toward sleepy races and lopsided victory margins. History suggests that margin will still be there when Nov. 9 dawns, but that doesn\u2019t mean that it shouldn\u2019t still be an active campaign of ideas, policies and views. Voters deserve that.\n\nEven more money\n\nThere was a great deal of hullabaloo \u2014 some of it caused by this column \u2014 about the proposed pay for elected, countywide officials in Peoria County. The concern was that in tight financial times for governments and taxpayers alike, giving raises that would bring those folks into six-figure salary territory sent a bad signal to taxpayers.\n\nUltimately board members opted for a compromise, giving no raise to the base salary of $94,210 for the county auditor, circuit clerk and coroner, but giving them an additional $1,200 \u201cservice payment\u201d in each year. That way their base rate won\u2019t grow.\n\nTurns out, though, those salaries only account for pay from the county. Because we\u2019re all state of Illinois taxpayers, we end up paying them again in a way that pushes their annual salary above $100,000.\n\nEach of those officials also receives a stipend from the state of Illinois for their job \u2014 part of a series of expenses that added up to more than $3 million to elected, countywide officials during the last fiscal year, according to data we requested from the state comptroller\u2019s office.\n\nEfforts by some legislators to eliminate those stipends have gone nowhere.\n\nFor most, the state stipend adds an additional $6,500 per year for the county clerk, circuit clerk, treasurer, auditor, recorder of deeds, coroner and sheriff. (Treasurers and sheriffs received extra in the last fiscal year \u2014 a total of $10,429 \u2014 because of an additional line item labeled \u201cstipend liability.\u201d)\n\nEven in these lean times of the 2016 budget year \u2014 you may have heard about the lack of a state budget going on a year \u2014 some of the officials are still getting their stipends because of court orders. A search of the comptroller\u2019s website shows payments to county auditors, sheriffs and coroners. However, clerks, circuit clerks, treasurers and recorders of deeds are still left out in the cold.\n\nHopefully those high five-figure county salaries are enough for them to make ends meet.\n\nAt least it\u2019s economical\n\nPeoria School District 150 is trying to encourage the community to buy in on its rebranding as \u201cPeoria Public Schools.\u201d But in addition to being asked to buy in, taxpayers in the district might be wondering just how much that buy in will cost. Such changes rarely come cheaply \u2014 we\u2019d suspect those who work at, say, Caterpillar Inc., OSF Saint Francis Medical Center, either of the UnityPoint Health facilities in town, or Bradley University have wondered at that expense from their own experience. Doubtless those tied to smaller employers in the area have likewise been curious about the cost.\n\nIt seems that the cost taxpayers will have to bear in this new effort is actually minuscule \u2014 on the order of $115. No extra zeros are missing from that figure.\n\nYou see, the district\u2019s logo and other brand markers have used \u201cPeoria Public Schools\u201d since 2008. So all letterhead, presentations and signage use that terminology, district spokesman Chris Coplan tells us. Buses are the exception. They still say \u201cPeoria Public School District 150,\u201d which the district is looking to change via the in-house transportation department to the new name.\n\nThe only external expense, Coplan says, is to buy a new Web domain at www.peoriapublicschools.org under a five-year purchase costing that $115. That\u2019ll become the primary Web address, though the old psd150.org site will still work. District officials will still use psd150.org Web addresses.\n\nChris Kaergard (C.K.) covers politics and Peoria County government for the Journal Star.
