She was diagnosed in early 2010. Four months later, lacking insurance and any means to pay for care, she died.\n\n\u201cThat was an unbelievable eye-opener for me,\u201d he said.\n\nMost Americans are insured through their jobs. For them, getting health insurance is a convenience, the only cost a slightly-diminished paycheck every two weeks. Not for Paul. He doesn\u2019t have money for a place to live, much less health coverage.\n\nThings weren\u2019t always bad for Paul, who preferred not to divulge his last name or have his photo taken. He had worked for a big technology company for years. When layoffs came following the dot-com bubble, he took a buyout and used the money to start his own IT consulting business. It was \u201cthriving,\u201d he explained. That is, until demand dried up after the 2008 market crash. His business went under and he was soon evicted by his landlords.\n\nOnce a paragon of Silicon Valley\u2019s promise, he became emblematic of its often-ignored side: those who have been left behind.\n\n\u201cI never imagined I would wind up homeless,\u201d he said, mournfully. After all, he\u2019d grown up in a well-off middle class family and was remarkably resourceful, teaching himself computer science to take advantage of the tech boom.\n\nHe has been homeless for nearly five years, sleeping in his car and trying every day to find work. It\u2019s been 12 years since he had health insurance. For Paul, health care has meant aspiring, an annual flu shot, and confidence he won\u2019t get sick.\n\nAnd even though he says he doesn\u2019t feel like he\u2019s in his mid-50s \u2014 \u201cI\u2019m 55, going on 28,\u201d Paul joked \u2014 his best friend showed him just how dangerous it is to rely on hope.\n\nHow Obamacare will help\n\nOn Monday, Paul showed up at Project Homeless Connect, a services fair for homeless people held near the Castro district of San Francisco, unsure of what he\u2019d find.\n\nPaul had tried numerous times, unsuccessfully, to get health coverage over the past few years. The problem is that, even though he had no health care, no home, and no assets, he still wasn\u2019t eligible for California\u2019s Medicaid program, Medi-Cal. That\u2019s because for years, only people who were elderly, disabled, or had dependent children were eligible for Medi-Cal. Childless adults like Paul were excluded from the system.\n\nThat is, until Obamacare.\n\nOne of the most important reforms in the Affordable Care Act is the expansion of Medicaid to cover anyone with an income at or below 133 percent of the federal poverty level. That currently stands at $15,282 for an individual or $31,322 for a family of four. (Last year, the Supreme Court ruled that states can choose not to comply with the Medicaid expansion; approximately half of states have blocked expansion, despite the fact that it\u2019s fully-funded by the federal government for the first three years.)\n\nFor folks like Paul who were among the 45 million people in 2010 without health insurance because they weren\u2019t covered by Medicaid and couldn\u2019t come anywhere near being able to afford individual insurance, Obamacare is nothing short of a miracle.\n\nI ran into Paul after his consultation with SF PATH, a federally-funded insurance program that has served low-income San Franciscans, but will automatically roll over all its enrollees into Medi-Cal beginning on January 1, 2014.\n\nEven as some in the media have focused on technical glitches to paint Obamacare as hopelessly flawed, that was hardly Paul\u2019s experience. After trying and failing to get health coverage for years, all it took was a brief sit-down for Paul to get enrolled.\n\n\u201cIt was unbelievably easy,\u201d he told ThinkProgress. \u201cFive minutes.\u201d\n\nHealth insurance won\u2019t immediately transform Paul\u2019s life. It won\u2019t give him a permanent place to live. It won\u2019t get him a job. But it will prevent his life from completely unraveling if he were to get injured or sick. It\u2019s one less worry in an already-stressful life.\n\nEspecially for the poor, health care is both a necessity and a luxury. And thanks to Obamacare, the safety net won\u2019t just be for those who can afford it.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "Paul hasn't been able to afford health insurance for twelve years.
