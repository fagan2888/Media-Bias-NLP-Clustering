Now, as she is set to take the test again on October 5, Hoyt wants 54 extra minutes to complete the exam in addition to a white noise machine, a computer, and snacks.\n\nThe Law School Admissions Test, or LSAT, is a standardized exam required for admission into law school. The test has been deemed a standard measure of the reading, verbal, and reasoning skills essential to one\u2019s success in law school and later on as a legal professional.\n\n\u201cAll she wants is to take the test. She wants to take it on a level playing field,\u201d said Jo Anne Simon, a Brooklyn attorney who specializes in disability cases.\n\nBut it seems that Hoyt, who lives in St. Louis, Mo., also wants the council to consider not reporting the fact that she took the LSAT under special accommodations to law schools. According to St. Louis Post-Dispatch, Simon believes that Hoyt is likely requesting this change because reporting that students took the test under modified circumstances may impact their chances of admission.\n\n\u201cIt inherently says these scores are less valid,\u201d said Simon.\n\nHoyt was formally diagnosed with learning and attention disabilities in 2012. She has also been treated for generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) for over 10 years. The lawsuit alleges that Hoyt\u2019s impairments limit her ability to write, read, concentrate, and think. As an undergraduate, Hoyt was granted double time on exams and assignments due to her disabilities.\n\nTests conducted by Dr. Jim Russell, who has worked for more than 20 years with people with disabilities, found that Hoyt needs double the allotted time to \u201ccomprehend what she is reading and to demonstrate what she knows.\u201d\n\nThis is not the first time the Law School Admissions Council has come under fire for its treatment of test takers with disabilities. In October 2012, the U.S. Dept. of Justice intervened in a lawsuit that was meant to be a statewide class action limited to California test takers, expanding the suit to address a pattern of discrimination nationwide.\n\n\u201cLSAC\u2019s discriminatory policies in the administration of the LSAT adversely impact people with disabilities nationwide. This is a systemic problem with serious consequences that echo throughout such individuals\u2019 academic and employment careers, and it needs to be addressed as such,\u201d said Thomas E. Perez, assistant attorney general for the Civil Rights Division. \u201cThe Justice Department\u2019s full participation in this case is an important step towards ending a long cycle of disability discrimination in standardized testing.\u201d\n\nIt is unclear whether the Council\u2019s apparent pattern of discrimination against people with disabilities will have any bearing on the outcome of Hoyt\u2019s case.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "lsat disability lawsuit, joan hoyt, learning impairment", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Joan Hoyt says that she was not properly accommodated for her disabilities during the two times she took the LSAT this year.", "title": "Does The LSAT Discriminate Against Test Takers With Disabilities?", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/another-lsat-disability-lawsuit-joan-hoyt-sues-failure-accommodate-learning-impairment-255951", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/07/800px-lsatstudyguide_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Joan Hoyt says that she was not properly accommodated for her disabilities during the two times she took the LSAT this year.", "title": "Does The LSAT Discriminate Against Test Takers With Disabilities?", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/another-lsat-disability-lawsuit-joan-hoyt-sues-failure-accommodate-learning-impairment-255951", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/07/800px-lsatstudyguide_1.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/07/800px-lsatstudyguide_1.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Policy/Biz", "published_time": "2013-09-07T14:56:41-04:00", "modified_time": "2013-09-25T11:06:20-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Joan Hoyt says that she was not properly accommodated for her disabilities during the two times she took the LSAT this year."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8cba\"", "article_summary": "The Law School Admissions Test, or LSAT, is a standardized exam required for admission into law school.\nJoan Hoyt, a 61-year-old recent University of Missouri graduate, filed suit against the Law School Admissions Council alleging that the non-profit failed to accommodate her generalized anxiety disorder and learning and attention disabilities on two separate occasions earlier this year.\nNow, as she is set to take the test again on October 5, Hoyt wants 54 extra minutes to complete the exam in addition to a white noise machine, a computer, and snacks.\nThe test has been deemed a standard measure of the reading, verbal, and reasoning skills essential to one\u2019s success in law school and later on as a legal professional.\nHoyt was formally diagnosed with learning and attention disabilities in 2012."}
