The Corner reveals what really happened:\n\nInsiders at the ball club report that the real culprit is Obamacare. Because the Affordable Care Act requires offering health benefits to employees who work more than 130 hours per month or 30 hours a week (\u201cfull time\u201d), the Cubs organization reorganized much of its staff during the off-season. Sources that spoke to the Chicago Sun-Times claimed that, on Tuesday night, the crew was drastically \u201cundermanned.\u201d\n\nHuh. What do you think of that, Dean Baker?\n\nThe problem with this story is that employer sanctions are not in effect for 2014. In other words, the Cubs will not be penalized for not providing their ground crew with insurance this year even if they work more than 30 hours per week. Apparently the Cubs management has not been paying attention to the ACA rules. This is yet another example of the skills gap that is preventing managers from operating their businesses effectively.\n\nQuite so. My guess is that this is just another installment in the long-running effort of American corporations to use Obamacare as a scapegoat for everything under the sun. Usually this has to do with raising copays for their employees or something like that, but the ingenuity of American capitalism knows no bounds. Why not blame a rain delay on Obamacare too?\n\nFor a more likely cause of penny pinching on the grounds crew, the Wall Street Journal has you covered.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "Mother Jones Magazine", "og": {"site_name": "Mother Jones", "description": "Probably not.", "title": "Did Obamacare wreck a baseball game?", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2014/08/did-obamacare-wreck-baseball-game", "image": "http://www.motherjones.com/files/blog_wrigley_field_0.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"title": "Did Obamacare wreck a baseball game?", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2014/08/did-obamacare-wreck-baseball-game", "image": {"src": "http://www.motherjones.com/files/blog_wrigley_field_0.jpg", "identifier": "http://www.motherjones.com/files/blog_wrigley_field_0.jpg"}, "creator": "kdrum", "site": "@MotherJones", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-70x70.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-310x310.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-310x150.png", "fb": {"admins": "13301307,670317733,1198876232,38509772,106892,2907757,306289,602422192,4101301,513450539"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "Health+Care,Sports", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-150x150.png"}, "article_summary": "For a more likely cause of penny pinching on the grounds crew, the Wall Street Journal has you covered.\nWhy not blame a rain delay on Obamacare too?\nThe Corner reveals what really happened:Insiders at the ball club report that the real culprit is Obamacare.\nA few days ago, a Chicago Cubs game was called in the fifth inning after the grounds crew had so much trouble spreading a tarp that the field got soaked during a rain delay and play couldn't be continued.\nMy guess is that this is just another installment in the long-running effort of American corporations to use Obamacare as a scapegoat for everything under the sun."}
