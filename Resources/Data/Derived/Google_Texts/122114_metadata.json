While he noted that Pressler has been rising in the polls, he said, \u201cIt\u2019s only because voters who don\u2019t know where Larry Pressler stands on the issues have moved towards him.\u201d Weiland\u2019s support has been stagnant, Wadhams said, adding that once voters discover that Pressler \u201chas moved way far to the left,\u201d his support will recede, too.\n\n\n\nIn the meantime, Rounds will continue to hammer home a conservative message in the Republican-leaning state and attack Pressler and Weiland together \u201cas two peas in a pod\u201d who support President Obama and Obamacare. While Rounds has pledged throughout his political career not to run negative ads, he is now running \u201ccontrast ads\u201d demonstrating the differences between his opinions on Obamacare and the Keystone XL pipeline and those of his opponents.\n\n\n\nWhile Wadhams went after Pressler and Weiland, he dismissed Howie, the independent running to Rounds\u2019s right, as not a significant factor. The Republican strategist said Howie would likely hover around 3 percent to 4 percent of the vote; his voters are diehards \u201cwho would be for him regardless,\u201d Wadhams said.\n\n\n\nNeedless to say, Howie disagrees with that characterization. In an interview with The Daily Beast, he described Rounds as \u201ca sinking ship\u201d and portrayed himself as a lifeboat for South Dakota voters who want to elect a conservative. Analyzing the ebb and flow of the race, Howie said Weiland has positive momentum but Rounds is collapsing. The social conservative, whose bumper stickers read \u201cI\u2019m with God, Guns and Gordon,\u201d compared Rounds to John McCain and Mitt Romney, calling the former South Dakota governor \u201ca bad candidate who does not represent conservative values and loses conservative traditional values voters.\u201d Howie also took a direct shot at Rounds\u2019s claim to Bloomberg Politics that South Dakota is \u201ca purple state.\u201d South Dakota is a conservative state, Howie said, \u201cWe just have purple leadership.\u201d\n\n\n\nHowie, who said he would caucus with the Republicans and \u201cstand beside Ted Cruz\u201d if elected, is not a typical social conservative. Although he is passionately pro-life, he has expressed openness to civil unions in the past. Speaking to The Daily Beast, he tried to explain that position: \u201cI don\u2019t want to parse words, but strictly speaking civil unions may not be something I would support in the strict sense of that term. But what I was trying to communicate is I support the rights of people to live in the lifestyle that is different than I believe is inappropriate, You don\u2019t start stripping rights away from people because they live in a different lifestyle.\u201d Howie added that he wouldn\u2019t support anything that would compromise his principles or \u201cthe institution of marriage.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe candidate Howie thinks has momentum, Rick Weiland, is no typical Democrat, either. His campaign has run a 3-minute ad featuring the candidate singing a reworked cover of the Old Crow Medicine Show song \u201cWagon Wheel,\u201d with lyrics focusing on his support for campaign finance reform and student loans. Daschle, who has been Weiland\u2019s biggest backer, said he thinks the race is \u201clooking better and better\u201d for the Democratic candidate. The former Senate majority leader noted that \u201crunning in an off year in a red state for a Democrat is always the preferred option\u201d and that the underfunded Democrat is running in one of the few states \u201cwhere it\u2019s still small enough to stay retail politically.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe big issue for Weiland has always been resources, but now that the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee is investing in the campaign, that has become less of an issue. As one Democratic strategist told The Daily Beast, \u201cFor a very small investment, you could saturate TV\u201d in South Dakota. As a result, the $1 million the DSCC is throwing in represents \u201can inexpensive gamble,\u201d the source said. The ad buy focuses entirely on attacking Rounds over his immigration fraud scandal and as a result provides a boost to Pressler in addition to Weiland.\n\n\n\nWeiland may look like an underdog across much of the state, but he has a big advantage in one area: Indian Country. About 10 percent of South Dakotans are Native Americans, and many live on desperately poor reservations like Pine Ridge and Rosebud and overwhelmingly vote Democratic.\n\n\n\nDespite the off-year election, it\u2019s expected that Native American turnout will rise significantly. Democratic state Rep. Kevin Killer, a member of the Oglala Sioux tribe, told The Daily Beast that new satellite voting sites placed throughout Indian Country as a result of a lawsuit under the Help America Vote Act will boost turnout significantly. This means that for the first time, most reservations will have full access to early voting sites. Killer also noted that there are some tribal elections on the same day. On the Pine Ridge Reservation, where Killer lives, voters can go to the same location to vote both tribal and federal elections, which will have an impact.\n\n\n\nPine Ridge also includes all of Shannon County, which was the most pro-Obama jurisdiction in the nation in 2012, where 93% of voters supported the president. The country will have a heated referendum this year to rename it Oglala Lakota County, since its namesake Peter Shannon, is best known for swindling the Sioux out of their land. This is bound to drive turnout even higher.\n\n\n\nBut while as one South Dakota Democrat points out that a big increase in Native American turnout can give Weiland a boost of up to 3 or 4 percent on Election Day, \u201cyou can\u2019t win on Indian country alone.\u201d Instead, the race is bound to come down to which campaign is best able to take advantage of the sudden scramble for attention and resources over the next three weeks. There\u2019s little modern precedent for a three-way race to suddenly become competitive less than a month before Election Day and it will still be a week before the impact of the surge in television advertising can be felt in polls. Rounds is still the frontrunner and has led in every poll so far. But, in a race this turbulent, anything can happen.", "article_metadata": {"twitter": {"site": "@thedailybeast", "card": "summary", "creator": "bencjacobs"}, "keywords": "Senate, South Dakota,United States, u.s. poli", "publicationDate": 201410150945, "wrap": "/content/dailybeast/politics", "description": "Meet the GOP shoo-in stumbling after a scandal, the independent stumping at cowboy poetry readings, the Democrat gaining ground, and the social conservative with diehard fans.", "pageNum": 1, "title": "South Dakota's Bizarre Four-Way (Senate Election, That Is)", "tags": "entity:organization/senate,entity:provinceorstate/south_dakota_united_states,topic:politics", "environment": "dev", "platform": "desktop", "template": "article", "type": "house", "parsely-page": "{\"title\":\"South Dakota\\\\u0027s Bizarre Four-Way (Senate Election, That Is)\",\"link\":\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/10/15/south-dakota-s-bizarre-four-way-senate-election-that-is.html\",\"image_url\":\"http://cdn.thedailybeast.com/content/dailybeast/articles/2014/10/15/south-dakota-s-bizarre-four-way-senate-election-that-is/jcr:content/image.crop.410.273.jpg/47112210.cached.jpg\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":\"/content/dailybeast/articles/2014/10/15/south-dakota-s-bizarre-four-way-senate-election-that-is\",\"pub_date\":\"2014-10-15T09:45:00+00:00\",\"section\":\"Politics\",\"author\":\"Ben Jacobs\",\"tags\":[\"senate\",\"south_dakota_united_states\",\"politics\"]}", "news_keywords": "Senate, South Dakota United States, US Politics", "sectionTaxanomies": "politics", "fb": {"admins": "1703087,30000737,1117577220,1276800108,931159,514915512", "app_id": 189930913679}, "authors": "Ben Jacobs", "article": {"section": "politics", "published_time": "2014-10-15T09:45:00.000Z", "author": "http://www.thedailybeast.com/contributors/ben-jacobshtml"}, "resourceType": "dailybeast2/components/pages/article", "contentpath": "/content/dailybeast/articles/2014/10/15/south-dakota-s-bizarre-four-way-senate-election-that-is", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Beast", "description": "Meet the GOP shoo-in stumbling after a scandal, the independent stumping at cowboy poetry readings, the Democrat gaining ground, and the social conservative with diehard fans.", "title": "South Dakota's Bizarre Four-Way (Senate Election, That Is)", "url": "http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/10/15/south-dakota-s-bizarre-four-way-senate-election-that-is.html", "image": "http://cdn.thedailybeast.com/content/dailybeast/articles/2014/10/15/south-dakota-s-bizarre-four-way-senate-election-that-is/jcr:content/image.img.2000.jpg/1413366310036.cached.jpg", "type": "article"}, "authorIds": "/etc/authors/b/ben-jacobs", "content-type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe26e7\"", "article_summary": "As one Democratic strategist told The Daily Beast, \u201cFor a very small investment, you could saturate TV\u201d in South Dakota.\nDick Wadhams, a strategist for the South Dakota Republican Party, dismissed the impact of the attacks against Rounds.\nIn an interview with The Daily Beast, he described Rounds as \u201ca sinking ship\u201d and portrayed himself as a lifeboat for South Dakota voters who want to elect a conservative.\nWhile Wadhams went after Pressler and Weiland, he dismissed Howie, the independent running to Rounds\u2019s right, as not a significant factor.\nAnalyzing the ebb and flow of the race, Howie said Weiland has positive momentum but Rounds is collapsing."}
