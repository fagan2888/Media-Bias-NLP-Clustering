Morgan Healthcare Conference in San Francisco, Aetna Inc. CEO Mark Bertolini said it is \u201ctoo early to give up on this process,\u201d and that the losses are \u201cnot breaking the bank,\u201d Reuters reported.\n\nAnthem Inc. President and CEO Joseph Swedish said in a Nov. 20 statement that the insurer remains committed to \u201ccontinuing our dialogue with policymakers and regulators regarding how we can improve the stability of the individual market.\u201d\n\nThe future of the exchanges rests on whether the insurers can adapt to the market, experts say, and it could take longer than expected.\n\n\u201cAny insurance market can be profitable,\u201d Ms. Pearson said. \u201cIt's just about needing to price the products correctly to cover expenses.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Business Insurance", "description": "UnitedHealth Group Inc., which has threatened to exit the public health insurance exchange business, recorded a $475 million loss from policies sold on the exchanges in 2015, more than $300 million greater than the losses the insurer projected just two months before.But despite the significant hit...", "title": "UnitedHealth public exchange losses fuel secession rumblings - Business Insurance", "url": "http://www.businessinsurance.com/article/20160120/NEWS03/160129977", "image": "http://www.businessinsurance.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/CB/20160120/NEWS03/160129977/AR/0/federal-health-insurance-exchange.jpg", "type": "article"}, "image_src": "http://www.businessinsurance.com/assets/rwd/bi-logo-footer.png", "description": "UnitedHealth Group Inc., which has threatened to exit the public health insurance exchange business, recorded a $475 million loss from policies sold on the exchanges in 2015, more than $300 million greater than the losses the insurer projected just two months before.But despite the significant hit...", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no, minimal-ui", "title": "UnitedHealth public exchange losses fuel secession rumblings - Business Insurance"}, "article_summary": "Minnetonka, Minnesota-based United on Tuesday reported losses of $720 million on the public exchange, including $245 million set aside for 2016 losses.\nOther players committedUnited could also be using its size and voice for political leverage to influence changes to the exchange market.\nWhile United has been vocal about its exchange losses, other insurers remain committed.\nBut despite the significant hit to United's earnings and more losses expected for 2016, many insurance experts \u2014 and United's rival health insurers \u2014 still see promise in the exchange business.\nBut industry experts say that for a giant and diversified company like United, the losses are a drop in the bucket."}
