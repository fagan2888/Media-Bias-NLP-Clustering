But he felt confident about keeping the All-Star forward after their last discussion.\n\n\u201cI felt really good about my conversation with Carmelo. We really struck a chord,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cThe two of us, I think feel really passionately about what we\u2019re trying to get accomplished. It\u2019s his ability to stay, be patient, lead and watch us develop a winner.\u201d\n\nThe Knicks offered Anthony a maximum level contract, worth nearly $130 million over five years, at their meeting in Los Angeles. Anthony had previously met with Chicago, Houston, Dallas and the Lakers.\n\nJackson added that he had made perhaps five contract proposals to Anthony. He has said he hopes the NBA\u2019s leading scorer in 2012-13 would be open to taking less than the max to allow for more future spending flexibility.\n\nJackson also confirmed that he had reached out to one of his former players, Pau Gasol. The Lakers star is a free agent and Jackson is interested, even while acknowledging the Knicks have far less money to offer than Gasol is worth.\n\nBut Jackson is trying to pitch him on the value of being in New York, even noting the importance to the Spaniard of being in the same city as the United Nations.\n\n\u201cHe knows what he has here and what is possible and I think he\u2019d like to play with Carmelo and I think he\u2019d like to play for a winner,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cAnd we can\u2019t guarantee that but with him, we\u2019d guarantee a much better chance.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press freelance writer Willie Ramirez in Las Vegas contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Phil Jackson says Knicks still awaiting word from Carmelo Anthony", "title": "Phil Jackson says Knicks still awaiting word from Carmelo Anthony", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/07/10/phil-jackson-says-knicks-still-awaiting-word-from-carmelo-anthony/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140710__carmelo2p1.jpg", "height": 436}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140710__carmelo2p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-07-10T16:59:40+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T05:59:24+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Knicks President Phil Jackson was expecting a decision from Carmelo Anthony on Thursday.\n\u201cBut I expected one yesterday and the day before yesterday,\u201d Jackson said.\nSpeaking to reporters at the Knicks\u2019 summer league practice in Las Vegas, Jackson said he has texted Anthony a couple of times since then, but hasn\u2019t gotten a response.\nJackson said he was still expecting good news, although he said he hadn\u2019t heard from Anthony since meeting with him a week earlier.\n\u201cHe knows what he has here and what is possible and I think he\u2019d like to play with Carmelo and I think he\u2019d like to play for a winner,\u201d Jackson said."}
