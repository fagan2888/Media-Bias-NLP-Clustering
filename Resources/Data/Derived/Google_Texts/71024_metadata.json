Biden Jr. is apologizing after a failed drug test. Meanwhile, Michael R. Bloomberg is taking his anti-soda crusade to the West Coast, and Democrats are getting little credit for one positive trend: plunging gas prices.\n\nBracing for a grim election on Nov. 4, the White House is grappling with what should come afterward \u2014 and how quickly to move to overhaul the nation\u2019s immigration system.\n\nAfter initially promising action before the end of the summer, President Obama last month delayed any announcement until after the elections on Nov. 4. The White House has said the president will take executive action \u201cbefore the end of the year.\u201d Significant changes are expected that could affect millions of immigrants living in the country illegally.\n\nOne camp inside the West Wing is arguing for a quick announcement right after the elections. That could help change the subject from what aides fear will be big losses in the House and Senate. They also worry that further delay will allow any immigration action to become mired in legislative negotiations over budget and other issues during a contentious lame-duck session in December.\n\nOther aides want to wait until Senate control is firmly determined, even if that means postponing an announcement until January after possible runoffs in Georgia and Louisiana. They argue that early action could doom Democrats\u2019 immigration hopes.\n\nExhibit A for that argument: Senator Mary L. Landrieu, the Democratic incumbent in Louisiana, said this week that she was flatly opposed to Mr. Obama taking action on his own. \u201cI support congressional action,\u201d she told reporters.\n\nThe pressure to wait could fade if control of the Senate is decided on Nov. 4, but the debate continues as White House officials try to map out just the right moment for what could be a highly divisive announcement.\n\n\u2014 Michael D. Shear\n\nIt has been something of a mismatch in Berkeley, Calif., where a campaign is on to persuade voters to impose a 1-cent-per-ounce tax on sugary drinks.\n\nThe beverage industry, which has successfully blocked just about every attempt to impose any kind of soda tax across the country, has already dropped $1.4 million to defeat the initiative in Berkeley \u2014 just shy of $12 per resident. Opponents have raised $135,000.\n\nNow, Michael R. Bloomberg is riding to the rescue. Aides said that he has decided to spend money in Berkeley \u2013 they did not say how much \u2013 to help counter the beverage industry, most likely paying for mailings and get-out-the-vote efforts.\n\n\u201cWe want to come in and try to equalize the spending disparity \u2013 which is enormous,\u201d said Howard Wolfson, a senior adviser to Mr. Bloomberg.\n\nAs New York\u2019s mayor, Mr. Bloomberg tried to ban the sale of supersized soft drinks and to persuade the State Legislature to impose a soda tax. The industry defeated him on both counts.\n\nIn reliably liberal Berkeley, the industry sees an opportunity to kill the soda tax idea for good \u2013 though acknowledges it could be a tough fight given the community\u2019s political history.\n\nInterestingly, Mr. Bloomberg is staying out of a similar battle across the bay in San Francisco. By every account, that is a much tougher battle for the soda opponents.\n\nBecause of how that ballot measure was written, it requires a two-thirds vote for approval, compared with a simple majority in Berkeley. And Mr. Bloomberg has never been known as a man to invest in what he sees as a losing cause.\n\n\u2014 Adam Nagourney\n\nFew political surrogates are as grateful to the states they visit as Bill Clinton was in New Hampshire on Thursday night.\n\n\u201cNo family in American public life owes more to the people of New Hampshire than Hillary and I do,\u201d he told about 1,200 cheering Democrats at the Jefferson-Jackson Day dinner in Manchester.\n\nNew Hampshire primary voters rescued Mr. Clinton\u2019s faltering presidential bid in 1992, and the state breathed life back into Hillary Rodham Clinton\u2019s 2008 presidential campaign after a lackluster showing in the Iowa caucuses.\n\nThis trip, Mr. Clinton was stumping for Senator Jeanne Shaheen, who is fighting off a challenge from Scott P. Brown. New Hampshire has the nation\u2019s first and only all-female congressional delegation, and its governor is also a woman. \u201cI\u2019m quite comfortable being here just campaigning for women and taking orders,\u201d Mr. Clinton told the crowd. \u201cIt\u2019s just like being at home.\u201d\n\nHe joked that the family achieved \u201cgender parity\u201d when his daughter, Chelsea, married, but lost it last month with the birth of her baby girl.\n\nMr. Clinton acknowledged that his campaign speech extolling Democratic values was not a new one. \u201cI feel like an old racehorse in a stable,\u201d he said at one point. \u201cPeople put me on the track and slap me on the rear to see if I can run around one more time.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Katharine Q. Seelye\n\nPresident Obama will remain at the White House, where he will offer remarks on consumer financial security safeguards and convene the National Security Council to discuss the status of Operation Inherent Resolve, the campaign against the Islamic State.\n\nMichelle Obama heads to Florida to campaign for former Gov. Charlie Crist, who is again running for governor.\n\nRepresentative Paul D. Ryan will be in Kansas to offer support to Senator Pat Roberts in his re-election bid.\n\nGov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin faces off with challenger Mary Burke in a governor\u2019s debate at 8 p.m.\n\nIn Georgia, it was only a matter of time before college football became an issue in the governor\u2019s race.\n\nOn Thursday, Gov. Nathan Deal and his Democratic rival, Jason Carter, engaged in a Twitter war over who was the bigger fan of the University of Georgia\u2019s star tailback Todd Gurley, who has been suspended over accusations that he took money to autograph sports memorabilia.\n\nMr. Carter, who earned his law degree at Georgia, started it with a Twitter photograph of himself with three raised fingers \u2013 in honor of Mr. Gurley\u2019s jersey number \u2013 and the hashtag #FreeGurley.\n\nLess than two hours later, Mr. Deal struck back with his own tweet: a picture of the governor with Mr. Gurley and other Georgia players.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always supported Gurley,\u201d Mr. Deal said, \u201cnot just during election season.\u201d\n\nMr. Deal earned undergraduate and law degrees from Mercer University in Macon, Ga., and is one of the few governors in recent times who did not pick up any degrees from the state\u2019s largest university.\n\nThe previous governor who was not a Georgia Bulldog? Mr. Carter\u2019s grandfather, Jimmy Carter, who graduated from the United States Naval Academy.\n\n\u2014 Alan Blinder\n\nMore than 900,000 people have already voted in the midterm elections, with 600,000 of those votes cast in Florida, according to The Associated Press.\n\nThe Financial Times documents the rise of Google as a powerhouse among political donors.\n\nPolitico reports that President Obama is under pressure from Hispanics, labor groups and immigration advocates to name Labor Secretary Thomas E. Perez as attorney general.\n\nSalon says Senator Ted Cruz of Texas has replaced Rick Santorum as the Republican Party\u2019s \u201canti-gay rock star.\u201d\n\nThe Daily Beast sums up the strange turn in the Oregon governor\u2019s race, where the incumbent\u2019s fianc\u00e9e has admitted that she once entered into a sham marriage for money.\n\nJohn Dickerson in Slate says the debate spat between Gov. Rick Scott of Florida and former Gov. Charlie Crist had its roots in Richard M. Nixon\u2019s sweat-soaked performance against John F. Kennedy in 1960.", "article_metadata": {"twitter": {"description": "Political News, Now.", "title": "First Draft", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2014/10/17/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/nytdesign/2014/politics/logo-flag-150.png", "site": "@NYTPolitics", "card": "summary"}, "adxPage": "blog.nytimes.com/first-draft/2014/10/17", "PT": "Blogs", "BN": "first-draft", "CG": "Politics", "dfp-ad-unit-path": "us/politics/firstdraft", "robots": "noodp", "sourceApp": "blogs", "live_stream_endpoint": "http://static01.nyt.com/live-coverage/first-draft/live-stream-endpoint-10172014.jsonp", "keywords": "politics, congress, midterms, elections, 2014, 2016, house, senate, advertising, political advertising, campaign finance, senator, Obama, Boehner, Clinton, Hillary, Hillary Clinton, Reid, McConnell, Christie, Paul, Washington, capitol", "ad_sensitivity": "noxxl", "article": {"section": "Politics"}, "nyt_active_day": 0, "SCG": "First Draft", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "And Mr. Bloomberg has never been known as a man to invest in what he sees as a losing cause.\nInterestingly, Mr. Bloomberg is staying out of a similar battle across the bay in San Francisco.\nPolitico reports that President Obama is under pressure from Hispanics, labor groups and immigration advocates to name Labor Secretary Thomas E.
