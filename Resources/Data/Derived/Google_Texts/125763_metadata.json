No hyperbole THERE, right? Phoo. This website is for DUMMIES. - What a Disaster: Obamacare Shows the Dangers of High Capacity Legislation\n\nDear Comrade Jackson,\n\nYou are correct: The website is, in part, for dummies. And that is what brought you here.\n\nLook, we\u2019ve been doing this since the Internet was (eye roll) invented by Al Gore.\n\nWe kind of have an idea what we are doing when it comes to luring you liberal trolls who are graduates from the Soros Academy of Remedial Writing and Logic.\n\nHence, the picture of the execution chamber.\n\nIt worked. Even liberals like you understood the implications.\n\nIt got you mad, and you reacted.\n\nI live off of folks like you.\n\nBecause, your reaction gives me the second and third and forth chance to make the underlying point.\n\nWhat\u2019s lethal injection compared to Obamacare? You may not like the death penalty, but at least the people who get it have due process under the law.\n\nThe rest of us won\u2019t be quite so lucky.\n\n\u201cObamaCare\u2019s cost-cutting board \u2014 memorably called a \u2018death panel\u2019 by Sarah Palin \u2014 is facing growing opposition from Democrats who say it will harm people on Medicare,\u201d writes The Hill. \u201cFormer Democratic National Committee Chairman Howard Dean drew attention to the board designed to limit Medicare cost growth when he called for its repeal in an op-ed late last month.\u201d\n\nTownhall Finance Video- Jihadists Take Control of Christian Village Maaloula in Syria\n\nThe Hill says that Democrats who face tough reelection fights are also calling for an overhaul of the law to get rid of the \u2018death panel\u2019.\n\nA wave of vulnerable Democrats over the past three months has signed on to bills repealing the board\u2019s powers, including Sen. Mark Pryor (Ark.) and Reps. Ron Barber (Ariz.), Ann Kirkpatrick (Ariz.), Kyrsten Sinema (Ariz.) and Elizabeth Esty (Conn.).\n\nAll five are considered vulnerable in next year\u2019s election, highlighting the stakes and the political angst surrounding the healthcare measure.\n\n\u201cThough I was called a liar for calling it like it is, many of these accusers finally saw that ObamaCare did in fact create a panel of faceless bureaucrats who have the power to make life and death decisions about healthcare funding,\u201d Palin wrote on Facebook, according to The Hill.\n\nBut she isn\u2019t the only person who has made the correlation between state-run healthcare and morbidity.\n\nIn June of this year our own Dan Mitchell from Cato pointed out that the UK\u2019s state-run national healthcare system is responsible for a massive amount of deaths.He quoted a Daily Mail report:\n\nAs many as 1,165 people starved to death in NHS hospitals over the past four years\u2026 According to figures released by the Office for National Statistics following a Freedom of Information request, for every patient who dies from malnutrition, four more have dehydration mentioned on their death certificate. \u2026In 2011, 43 patients starved to death and 291 died in a state of severe malnutrition, while the number of patients discharged from hospital suffering from malnutrition doubled to 5,558. \u2026NHS hospitals have also stood accused of fiddling figures to mask the numbers of patients dying needlessly.\n\nThere were only 32 legal executions by due process in the United States in all of 2011.\n\nIf anyone is guilty of hyperbole, it\u2019s the supporters of Obamacare who have called it a job-creator and a deficit-fighter, while using tax money to make commercials like this in support of it:\n\nBlech. Make sure you watch for the farmer with the carrot. He looks like he\u2019s in a SNL cartoon of the Ambiguously Gay Duo.\n\nA Hat Tip to Guy Benson for the commercial.\n\nI\u2019ll get even with you Guy.\n\nDoes anyone find a state-sponsored cartoon with the lyrics \"Long Live Oregonians\" ironic as assisted suicide in Oregon hit an all-time high in 2012?\n\nWhich is it? Long Live Oregonians? Or Right to Die Oregonians? Or We reserve the right right to kill you, Oregonians?\n\nThe scary thing is that this could get even get MORE Orwellian. Thanks Obamacare.\n\nJokamura wrote: But they still win elections don't they? - Liberals Do the Same Thing, Get the Same Result Year After Year, After Year, After...\n\nDear Comrade Jokamura,\n\nThey did about what the system allows actually.They overdrew the goodwill of Americans in 2009 and 2010. They got trounced in 2010. They fought to a standstill in 2012 with Obama picking up a close win.\n\nIf you think that means liberals will be in a permanent majority, then have at it. That\u2019s the most certain way for liberals to lose elections.\n\nPlus, wining against Romney isn\u2019t exactly the same thing as taking on the New England Patriots. It\u2019s more like playing against Jacksonville.\n\n2012 was an election crying out for a leader, and I think in the end, the American people felt poorly about both of their choices.\n\nDon\u2019t expect to get so lucky next time around.\n\nDr Roy wrote: I don't think this issue is as cut and dried as it would first appear. The question is does a business owner have the right to prevent his customers and employees from carrying a concealed weapon onto his property? - Way to Stick to Your Guns Starbucks\n\nDear Comrade Doctor,\n\nOf course you wouldn\u2019t. You never have a strong opinion about anything. Unless it\u2019s saying \u201ceverybody steals,\u201d which I suppose is something you learned while serving faithfully in the Illinois Brotherhood of Teamsters, Garbage Dumpsters, Bricklayers and Apprentice Pot Hole Fillers local 317.\n\nA business owner doesn\u2019t have the right to abridge ANYONE\u2019S rights.\n\nLiberals must have a reading disorder.\n\n\"A well-regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.\"\n\nIt doesn\u2019t read shall not be infringed\u2026 unless of course the owner of private property decides that he\u2019d like to infringe on it. Or\u2026 shall not be infringed unless of course the exercise of said right makes certain liberals squeamish and uncomfortable because they don\u2019t know the first things about guns anyway. It also doesn\u2019t say shall not be infringed unless popular opinion amongst latte sippers somehow overrules local laws that the property owner was adhering to before.\n\ntbmbuzz wrote: Starbucks is REQUESTING that guns not be brought into their stores, which they have every right to do. In fact, as a private entity they also have the right to ban guns outright from their property. The Second Amendment applies to the GOVERNMENT, not private individuals and institutions. What is so hard to understand about this fundamental concept? Both sides for some reason have decided to make Starbucks a whipping boy for their point of view. Neither side has the right to dictate to Starbucks what its gun policy should be. Nor does either side have the right to dictate to Starbucks what its First Amendment rights are. Funny how gun fanatics become fascists just like the Left when they perceive a threat to their pet issue, which isn't the case here with Starbucks. The Constitution really is dead in this country. If rabid 2nd Amendment advocates refuse to patronize Starbucks now, they are free to exercise that right. However, by the same token, Starbucks is free to exercise ITS Constitutional rights. - Way to Stick to Your Guns Starbucks\n\nDear Comrade Buzz,\n\nI request that everyone send me the balance of their personal checking account, plus any overdraft amount they have available.\n\nI have the right to request that, just as Starbucks has the right to request whatever they want.\n\nPlease send to:\n\nPO Box 712\n\nParker, CO 80134\n\nYou can make check payable to: Parent Led Reform.\n\nOh, and I want a pony too.\n\nTrue Liberal wrote: Interesting dichotomy. On the one hand, we have our individual 2nd Amendment rights to have firearms. On the other, we have our freedom of association. I am actually OK with Starbuck's or any other establishment refusing to serve those that open-carry or for any other reason. It should be part of their right to freedom of association. Those that are not welcome at that establishment can go elsewhere. We can let the free market work. - Way to Stick to Your Guns Starbucks\n\nDear True Liberal,\n\nIsn\u2019t that the same argument that segregationists made?\n\nGoldilocks wrote: The Great Recession began while Bush was President. So how did Democrats trigger the Great Recession? -How to Break Up With Obama\n\nDear Goldilocks,\n\nAh, yes: Blame Bush!\n\nThe old refrain. You guys should set that to music to the world\u2019s smallest violin.\n\nDemocrats didn\u2019t trigger the Great Recession. Rather they put the GREAT in the recession.\n\nWe\u2019ve had recessions before. There is a list of do\u2019s and don\u2019ts on recession. The Democrats since 2009 have been using the \u201cdon\u2019t\u201d list.\n\nHence, this has been the worst economic recovery ever. That\u2019s 100 percent the responsibility of: 1) Our Idiot in Chief; and 2) his 111th Congress, which passed some of the stupidest legislation on record, much of which still hasn\u2019t been implemented\u2026because it\u2019s soooo STUPID.\n\nSee the article above on Obamacare.\n\nairstart wrote Dear Mr. Ransom, I take issue with your ad-hoc comments about boomers. As a boomer myself growing up in the Midwest rural (flyover country) 50's and 60's, I remember working nights through Jr. Hi and High school for 60 cents an hour to buy school clothes, compulsory military service (Viet Nam era) nuke drills in grade school cold war era. Your ignorance of boomers except the ones in DC is apparent. Get out of your penthouse office, read some American History that hasn't suffered the revisionist's pen, and re-think your broad brush approach to who boomers really are. - The Unhappy Presidencies of Carter and Obama: Merging the Idol and the Ideal\n\nDear Comrade Airstart,\n\nI knew you would take issue with it.\n\nYou think that working nights to buy clothes was tough?\n\nTry living during the Great Depression like General Felix Sparks did.\n\nSparks left home shortly after graduation with $18 his father borrowed from a family friend. He rode the boxcars all around the West, sleeping outside with other hobos until he finally ran out of money. Down and out in San Francisco, he joined the Army because he was literally starving.\n\nHe was one of the lucky ones.\n\nHe left the army after a few years and took some money he had saved working on the side as a photographer and went to college. He was called back to service as America entered World War II.\n\nYou can read about him in the book The Liberator: One World War II Soldier's 500-Day Odyssey from the Beaches of Sicily to the Gates of Dachau.\n\nThis from the publisher:\n\nFrom July 10, 1943, the date of the Allied landing in Sicily, to May 8, 1945, when victory in Europe was declared \u2013 the entire time it took to liberate Europe \u2013 no regiment saw more action, and no single platoon, company, or battalion endured worse, than the ones commanded by Felix Sparks, who had entered the war as a greenhorn second lieutenant of the 157th \u201cEager for Duty\u201d Infantry Regiment of the 45th \u201cThunderbird\u201d Division.Sparks and his fellow Thunderbirds fought longest and hardest to defeat Hitler, often against his most fanatical troops, when the odds on the battlefield were even and the fortunes of the Allies hung in the balance \u2013 and when the difference between defeat and victory was a matter of character, not tactics or armor.\n\nBoomers had compulsory military service, too but it was easily avoided. It certainly wasn\u2019t looked to as salvation as it was for Sparks.\n\nI was born in 1964, so technically I\u2019m a boomer too. I got a job when I was 14 so that I could buy my own food. I was raised by my father who travelled most of the time. But I\u2019m not kidding myself that I was Felix Sparks. This is a guy who didn\u2019t even have a home to go to for much of his life from 18 years old to 30.\n\nYou\u2019re comparing what you went through to the generation that brought us guys like Sparks?\n\nHa!\n\nAs for my penthouse in D.C., I don\u2019t have one. I grew up in Chicago and live in Colorado, double flyover country. Even people from the Midwest fly over us.\n\nI don\u2019t speak for D.C. and D.C. doesn\u2019t speak for me.\n\nI bet I know more about the real history of the country than you do.\n\nIn any event, you\u2019ve t least proven you know nothing about me.\n\nJay Hackett wrote: So I'm at Barnes and Noble checking to see if the new issues of Collector Vehicle books that I don't subscribe to were in....on the same side of the rack but at the end of the rack I heard some sounds....I looked over....a 50ish guy was looking a magazine all over while he grunted and moaned...figured it was a Playboy or some other mag of that genre....when I walked past him to get to the checkout I was curious so I looked over his shoulder....it was a guns/weapons mag......solidified my belief that abnormal obsession with guns is for the phallus-challenged and the phallus-deprived...just sayin'. - 0-4 Obama Underdog Against Syria\n\nDear Comrade Jay,\n\nSo you seem to be saying that lesbians have an unnatural obsession with guns?\n\nYou also seem to be implying that our Founding Fathers were, um, phallus-challenged.\n\nI find it odd that you\u2019d be attracted to anyone who was grunting or moaning in a bookstore. I\u2019m surprised too that you\u2019d be looking over his shoulder to see what he was reading as you passed by.\n\nI thought that kind of stuff was supposed to be done in the restroom stall with a secret foot tap.\n\nIt sounds to me like you\u2019re the one who is challenged. You seem to not understand what the phallus or the gun is properly used for.\n\nThat\u2019s it for this week.\n\nV/r,\n\nJR", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Long Live Oregonians- Unless of Course You Want to Die- in Which Case We'll Kill You - John Ransom - Personal Finance, Financial Advice, Money, Business News, Real Estate, Mortgages, Investments, Stocks, Ransom Notes Radio, John Ransom", "og": {"site_name": "finance.townhall.com", "description": "Does anyone find a state-sponsored cartoon with the lyrics \"Long Live Oregonians\" ironic as assisted suicide in Oregon hit an all-time high in 2012?
