Americans \u2013 especially young Americans \u2013 need to know the facts, and they need to know how they\u2019re getting cheated, and they need to get angry. The following should help.\n\n1. $1,000,000,000,000,000 in Sales. Not One Cent for Sales Tax\n\nThe trading volume on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) reached an incomprehensible $1 quadrillion in notional value in 2012. That\u2019s a thousand trillion dollars. In comparison, the entire U.S. GDP is $17 trillion.\n\nOn that quadrillion dollars of sales CME imposes transfer fees, contract fees, brokerage fees, Globex fees, clearing fees, and contract surcharges, many of them on both the buyer\u2019s and seller\u2019s side. As a result, the company had a profit margin higher than any of the top 100 companies in the nation from 2008 to 2010, and it\u2019s gotten even higher since then.\n\nBut not a penny in sales tax for the taxpayers who provide publicly-funded infrastructure, technology, systems of law, and security to help them process billions of financial transactions.\n\nInstead \u2014 incredibly \u2014 CME complained that its taxes were too high, and they demanded and received an $85 million tax break from the State of Illinois.\n\n2. A Single Tax-Avoider Made More Money in 2013 Than ALL the Emergency Responders in the U.S.\n\nWarren Buffett watched his net worth grow by $12 billion in one year, much more than the $8.3 billion our country spends on almost a quarter-million Emergency Medical Technicians and Paramedics.\n\nMeanwhile, his company, Berkshire Hathaway, hasn\u2019t been paying its taxes. According to the New York Post, \u201cthe company openly admits that it owes back taxes since as long ago as 2002.\u201d A review of Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s annual report confirms that despite profits of almost $29 billion in 2013, a $395 million refund was claimed, while $57 billion in federal taxes remain deferred on the company\u2019s balance sheet.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway does report an income tax expense. But all of it, in the company\u2019s own words, is hypothetical.\n\n3. Walmart: $13,000 per U.S. Employee Taken in Profits, $4,000 per U.S. Employee Taken from Taxpayers\n\nIt gets worse. In addition to Walmart\u2019s $19 billion in U.S. profits last year, the four Walton siblings together made about $29 billion from their personal investments. That\u2019s over $33,000 per U.S. employee in profits and family stock gains. Yet they pay their 1.4 million American employees so little that the average Walmart worker depends on about $4,000 per year in taxpayer assistance, for food stamps and other safety net programs.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Most egregious?
