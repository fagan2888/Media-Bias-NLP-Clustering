Opposition leaders have called for an unelected council to rule the country.\n\nCoups are nothing new to Thailand. The last one took place in 2006 and removed Yingluck's brother, Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, from office. Since the end of the absolute monarchy in the country in 1932, the military has staged 11 successful coups.\n\nThe opposition had openly invited the military to stage another coup to remove Yingluck, a request that was rebuffed until December, when the army chief in an interview declined to rule out the possibility.\n\nAsked whether the army would seize the government for the second time in less than a decade, Gen. Prayuth Chan-ocha said: \"That door is neither open nor closed. ... It will be determined by the situation.\"\n\nThe months of political uncertainty and street protests in Thailand have also taken a toll on the second-biggest economy in Asia, contributing to falling private consumption and investment and negative GDP growth, Reuters reports.\n\nThe news agency says:\n\n\"The political turmoil is also hurting Thailand's big auto sector, which accounts for 11% of GDP and is the largest in Southeast Asia. Domestic car sales are falling and some 30,000 industry jobs have been lost his year. \"Thai Airways last week reported a quarterly loss and expects more red ink in the second and third quarters as 'we have been severely affected by the politics,' chairman Prajin Juntong said. \"Tourism accounts for about 10% of GDP and visitors dropped about 5% in January-April from a year earlier.\"\n\nCopyright 2016 NPR.
