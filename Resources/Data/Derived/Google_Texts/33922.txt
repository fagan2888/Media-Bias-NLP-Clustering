DURANGO, Colo. (AP) — Three people from Texas are accused of stealing pot in two separate robberies of Colorado medical marijuana dispensaries.

In Durango, two 17-year-olds were arrested Monday for allegedly stealing a jar of pot after entering a dispensary wearing bandanas, cowboy hats and sunglasses and spraying workers with pepper spray. The Durango Herald (http://bit.ly/1pWaFFH) reports employees were able to provide a description of their car and the teens from Corsicana, Texas were quickly found.

In Pueblo County, the sheriff’s office says 40-year-old David Lopez of Austin forced an employee into a Pueblo West dispensary at gunpoint Monday, ripped the phones from the wall and took a large amount of pot and pot products. Someone in the store called 911 and deputies arrested him as he left. It’s not clear if he has a lawyer.
