Law Talk With Epstein, Yoo & Senik Weekend at Bernie’s Law Talk With Epstein, Yoo & Senik Weekend at Bernie’s ArchiveDownloadiTunesStitcherRSS

Now that Professor Yoo’s returned from his international jet-setting (he came back with some strong opinions about hummus), we’ve shaken off the cobwebs and kicked off our summer session. This week: Did Congress make a reasonable compromise on the NSA program or did they put national security at risk? Are Supreme Court justices getting too comfortable being pop culture icons (personally, we thought Scalia got kicked off The Voice way too early)? How would Epstein and Yoo pick who to put on the bench? Why does John know so much about Hollister? And why is Richard having dinner with Bernie Sanders? All will be revealed when you step into the faculty lounge. It’s the law: subscribe to this podcast either on iTunes or on Stitcher. Help Ricochet by Supporting Our Sponsors!
