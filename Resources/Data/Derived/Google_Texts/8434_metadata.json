The other kids in the park aren\u2019t interested in him. And he\u2019s not interested in them.\n\n\u201cI just like to play by myself,\u201d he says.\n\nStrazh has autism. Today is a good day. But on most others, Strazh has meltdowns. Something frustrates him and he can\u2019t control his emotions.\n\n\u201cI sometimes end up screaming,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I end up yelling and screaming.\u201d\n\nAnd hitting and banging things, throwing things, adds Strazh\u2019s mom, Natalie Dunnege. As a single parent, she says she bears the brunt of it.\n\n\u201cHe told me that I disgusted him,\u201d she says softly. \u201cHe tells me he hates me.\u201d\n\nDunnege puts all her spare money into therapy for Strazh. She says it helps a lot. But Dunnege herself is struggling, feeling depressed and overwhelmed. She decided to look for her own therapist.\n\n\u201cOne of the things that I\u2019ve really had to wrap my head around is that I can\u2019t change him. I can only change how I handle the situation,\u201d she explains. \u201cAnd not that I would want to change who he is. He\u2019s a really good kid, but it\u2019s a lot to handle, especially as a single parent.\u201d\n\nBut when she logged onto her insurance website to find a therapist, she realized her copay for a mental health visit was going to be upwards of $75 \u2014 more than double her copay for other doctors\u2019 appointments. Under a 2008 federal mental health law, those copays are supposed to be the same.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no way,\u201d Dunnege says. \u201cIt\u2019s out of my budget right now.\u201d\n\nDunnege lives in a one-bedroom apartment with her son and her father in San Francisco\u2019s Haight district. Grandfather and grandson sleep in twin beds side by side. It\u2019s an awkward walk past those beds to the only bathroom. Dunnege says $75 a week for therapy is impossible.\n\n\u201cMy income, I just made lower middle income. Just by the skin of my teeth,\u201d she says. \u201cSo I just have to hold off until I\u2019m actually middle class.\u201d\n\nMore than 43 million Americans suffer from depression, anxiety and other mental health conditions, according to the most recent federal data. But more than half the people who felt like they needed help last year, never got it. Even people who had insurance complained of barriers to care. Some said they still couldn\u2019t afford it; some were embarrassed to ask for help. Others just couldn\u2019t get through the red tape.\n\nRecent health laws, the 2008 Mental Health Parity Act and the Affordable Care Act, were supposed to fix this. They require health plans to provide benefits for mental health conditions on par with physical health conditions. Under the law, insurance companies can\u2019t charge higher copays or set up separate deductibles for mental health care compared to other medical or surgical care. They can\u2019t limit hospital stays or require preauthorization for mental health treatment if the same limits are not applied to treatment for physical health conditions.\n\nBut advocates say insurance companies are still finding ways to keep people who need care from getting it. Some are still not complying with the law. And some have found subtle, technically legally, ways to limit treatment.\n\nProblems with Mental Health Provider Directories\n\nNatalie Dunnege encountered some of these barriers when she tried again to find a therapist. In the last year, she got a promotion at work and moved into a larger apartment. Her employer switched to a better health plan, too. Now she has Blue Shield coverage, and her copay for mental health appointments is only $20.\n\n\u201cWhich I was really excited about,\u201d Dunnege says.\n\nBut when she looked for a therapist who took her insurance, she struck out.\n\n\u201cI contacted six or seven,\u201d she says.\n\nOnly three called her back.\n\n\u201cOne of them, they were completely booked,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd then the other two just didn\u2019t accept the insurance anymore.\u201d\n\nZero hits out of seven. Had to be a bad draw, right?\n\nTo find out, we decided to conduct our own survey and called all the psychologists \u2014 100 in total \u2014 that were listed on the Blue Shield website for Natalie\u2019s plan in San Francisco.\n\nHere\u2019s what happened:\n\nThe end result: 28 psychologists actually had appointments. And only eight of them had slots available outside regular work hours. Eight out of 100.\n\n\u201cSorry, I wish you the best of luck,\u201d was a common refrain in therapists\u2019 voicemail messages.\n\nFor Natalie Dunnege, after seven rejections, she gave up looking.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard when you\u2019re feeling sad and you feel like you can barely keep things together,\u201d she says. \u201cIt just seemed like way too much at the time.\u201d\n\nMental health advocates say this is exactly what insurance companies are hoping.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a way to control cost,\u201d says Keith Humphreys, a Stanford psychiatry professor who served as an advisor to Congress when it was developing the 2008 Mental Health Parity Act. He says while insurers are now required to keep an adequate number of clinicians listed in their directories, they still find ways to sidestep the rules.\n\n\u201cYou know the law doesn\u2019t say you can\u2019t put people on there who are dead, or you can\u2019t put people on there who are not taking new patients,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat that translates into, then, is people have to wait longer for care, which then cuts expenditures for the insurer and reduces access.\u201d\n\nCalifornia passed a law last year, SB 137, raising the standards for physician directories. Insurers will have to police their lists for providers who are booked or retired. But a lot of questions remain about how the law will be enforced, especially when it comes to mental health providers, who are largely self-employed, solo practitioners.\n\nThe insurance industry says it will be a challenge.\n\n\u201cWhen you have networks as large as ours and you have as many enrollees as we have here in California, you\u2019re not going to be able to just have everything accurate every single second of every single day,\u201d says Charles Bacchi, CEO of the California Association of Health Plans.\n\nHe said the industry is working to make it better.\n\n\u201cBut we also need to be realistic,\u201d he says. \u201cWe don\u2019t run a mental health provider\u2019s office. They do. And how they handle people calling their offices is their job.\u201d\n\nIn a statement, Blue Shield said it tries to make it easy for providers to update changes in their contact information and schedule.\n\n\u201cWe understand that there are a number of issues that impact a provider\u2019s availability to take new patients, such as administrative limitations and fluctuating numbers of patients based on their individual needs. When those instances arise, the provider is required to notify us so that patients have access to the most up-to-date information about who is available in their area.\u201d\n\nThe industry also says it\u2019s facing another challenge: a nationwide shortage of mental health providers, further exacerbated by the millions of people who signed up for insurance under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nIn California, there are \u201caround 4 to 5 million more people with coverage, just in the last two years,\u201d Bacchi says. \u201cAnd that\u2019s creating a strain for everybody, plans and mental health providers.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "A single mom, a son with autism and a maddening search for the help she badly needed.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "California Healthline", "description": "A single mom, a son with autism and a maddening search for the help she badly needed.", "title": "Single Mom\u2019s Search For Therapist Foiled By Insurance Companies", "url": "http://californiahealthline.org/news/single-moms-search-for-therapist-foiled-by-insurance-companies/", "image": {"width": 770, "identifier": "https://californiahealthline.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/dunnege1_770.jpg", "height": 513}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://californiahealthline.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/dunnege1_770.jpg?w=640"}, "site": "@CalHealthline", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@CalHealthline"}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://californiahealthline.org/feed/;icon-uri=https://s2.wp.com/i/favicon.ico", "application-name": "California Healthline", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/WordPresscom", "published_time": "2016-05-25T09:00:30+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-05-25T16:31:35+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Under a 2008 federal mental health law, those copays are supposed to be the same.\nUnder the law, insurance companies can\u2019t charge higher copays or set up separate deductibles for mental health care compared to other medical or surgical care.\nThey require health plans to provide benefits for mental health conditions on par with physical health conditions.\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s creating a strain for everybody, plans and mental health providers.\u201d\nProblems with Mental Health Provider DirectoriesNatalie Dunnege encountered some of these barriers when she tried again to find a therapist."}
