See United States ex rel. Kane v. Healthfirst, Inc., et al., No. 11-2325 (S.D.N.Y.). The Government does not allege that the hospitals were in any way responsible for causing the overpayments; the overpayments were allegedly caused by errors of a Medicaid managed care plan administrator. Rather, the Government\u2019s allegations are solely that the hospitals did not timely return the overpayments after they were identified. This appears to be the first time in which the Government has intervened in a qui tam case based entirely on the 60-day repayment requirement.\n\nAccording to the Government\u2019s Complaint, the defendant hospitals were providers in a Medicaid managed care network operated by Healthfirst, Inc. Under the terms of participation, for patients enrolled in the Healthfirst Medicaid managed care program, the hospitals were permitted to receive reimbursement only from Healthfirst or from permitted patient co-payments. A billing system error by Healthfirst, however, caused it to send remittances to hospitals that erroneously authorized the hospitals to seek additional payments from secondary payors. As a result, Defendant hospitals automatically generated and submitted bills to New York Medicaid.\n\nBeginning in January 2009, the New York Department of Health Comptroller\u2019s Office allegedly made an inquiry of Defendants regarding a small number of these claims that were erroneously submitted for reimbursement. As a result of the inquiry, Defendants undertook an internal investigation to determine the reasons for the improper claims and the scope of the problem, even as the Comptroller\u2019s Office identified more claims. By February 2011, Defendants had allegedly identified more than 900 claims erroneously submitted to Medicaid, leading to over $1 million wrongfully paid by Medicaid as a secondary payor. According to the Government\u2019s Complaint, Defendants allegedly delayed repaying the majority of these claims for more than two years and that repayments were made only after further pressing by the Comptroller\u2019s Office.\n\nAccording to the DOJ, this failure to act promptly violates the ACA\u2019s 60-day repayment provision, which requires Medicare and Medicaid overpayments be reported and returned within \u201c60 days after the date on which the overpayment was identified.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a71320a-7k(d)(2). The ACA further provides that the failure to make a timely refund can serve as the basis for False Claims Act liability. Id. \u00a7 1320a-7k(d)(3).\n\nThe False Claims Act imposes liability of treble damages plus penalties of $5,500 to $11,000 per false claim, and the Government\u2019s Complaint seeks \u201ctreble the United States\u2019 damages, in an amount to be determined at trial, plus an $11,000 penalty for each overpayment retained in violation of the FCA.\u201d Here, the hospitals eventually did repay the alleged Medicaid overpayments before the Government intervened. It is not apparent that Medicaid incurred any actual damages to treble, aside from potentially foregone interest.\n\nThe Government\u2019s intervention in Healthfirst illustrates the need for health care providers to diligently investigate potential Medicare and Medicaid overpayments that come to their attention and to take appropriate remedial action.", "article_metadata": {"description": "On June 27, 2014, the United States intervened in a qui tam action under the False Claims Act alleging that certain New York hospitals failed to refund Medicaid overpayments within 60 days of identifying them, as required by the Affordable Care Act.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"site_name": "The National Law Review", "description": "On June 27, 2014, the United States intervened in a&amp;nbsp;qui tam&amp;nbsp;action under the False Claims Act alleging that certain New York hospitals failed to refund Medicaid overpayments within 60 days o", "title": "The Government Intervenes In False Claims Act Case Alleging Failure To Return Overpayments Within 60 Days", "url": "http://www.natlawreview.com/article/government-intervenes-false-claims-act-case-alleging-failure-to-return-overpayments-", "image": "http://www.natlawreview.com/sites/default/files/styles/thumbnail/public/article/aux/1131/CMS%20tall%20small.jpg?itok=wEiqIWnC", "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Legal, Business, Government, New York, Affordable Care Act, Medicaid, CMS, Overpayments, False Claims Act", "msvalidate.01": "5493B547C0AB527FF4CF8C4D0127302A", "google-site-verification": "SAKcOmA6_i0E79oG2TjlPWfOSs9kMM6EWAZNaT0aBtA", "verify-v1": "nSkrvEqyOIUMGKMak3OBIKcpcABac4XWK5NJKMuMtBY=", "y_key": "fe6cd8bd83ff0c09", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Legal, Business, Government, New York, Affordable Care Act, Medicaid, CMS, Overpayments, False Claims Act"}, "article_summary": "The ACA further provides that the failure to make a timely refund can serve as the basis for False Claims Act liability.\nTuesday, July 8, 2014On June 27, 2014, the United States intervened in a qui tam action under the False Claims Act alleging that certain New York hospitals failed to refund Medicaid overpayments within 60 days of identifying them, as required by the Affordable Care Act.\nRather, the Government\u2019s allegations are solely that the hospitals did not timely return the overpayments after they were identified.\nAccording to the Government\u2019s Complaint, the defendant hospitals were providers in a Medicaid managed care network operated by Healthfirst, Inc.\nAccording to the DOJ, this failure to act promptly violates the ACA\u2019s 60-day repayment provision, which requires Medicare and Medicaid overpayments be reported and returned within \u201c60 days after the date on which the overpayment was identified.\u201d 42 U.S.C."}
