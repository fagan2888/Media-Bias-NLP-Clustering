Burwell upholding the legality of the Affordable Care Act\u2019s insurance subsidies, and it\u2019s growing increasingly clear just how much Republicans in Congress were banking on the court to do their dirty work for them. But now that the court has sided with the government, full responsibility for fulfilling the promise of repealing Obamacare falls to Republicans in Congress, and they\u2019re having a hell of a time figuring out what to do.\n\nWay back in March, Republican leaders in the House and Senate agreed upon a new strategy to try and repeal the healthcare law \u2013 they\u2019d nuke it via budget reconciliation. It\u2019s a one-shot tactic that would allow them to push a repeal measure through to passage without having to first overcome a Democratic filibuster. The GOP leadership had previously been wary about going down that road, since it would take away their best tool for getting important, non-symbolic legislation passed. But they figured that repeal-through-reconciliation would make their cranky conservative members happy, and it would finally force President Obama to veto a repeal measure, so it was worth it for the political benefit. They passed a budget resolution which instructed five committees spread across the House and Senate to come up with language repealing portions of the ACA by no later than July 24 \u2013 two weeks from today.\n\nWith that self-imposed deadline bearing down, one would think Republicans would be busily working to make good on their promise to force an Obamacare repeal to the president\u2019s desk. But they\u2019re not. In fact, as Politico reported yesterday, Republicans in the Senate are \u201cdownplaying expectations\u201d that they\u2019ll actually go through with a repeal via reconciliation, and won\u2019t commit to meeting the July 24 deadline:\n\nThe chairmen of the key Senate committees overseeing Obamacare \u2014 Orrin Hatch of Finance, and Lamar Alexander of Health, Education, Labor and Pensions \u2014 say they haven\u2019t drawn up reconciliation plans, saying doing so is up to leadership. Sen. John Barrasso (R-Wyo.), a member of the Senate leadership and a point person on health policy, said there\u2019s no rush to do reconciliation immediately \u2014 and that Senate leaders haven\u2019t decided on how to use the fast-track budget tool. \u201cThere\u2019s no timeline on the reconciliation bill, so it can be used at any point,\u201d Barrasso said, even though the GOP\u2019s own budget resolution had instructed five health care committees \u2014 two in the Senate and three in the House \u2014 to come up with a repeal plan by July 24.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The GOP banked on the Supreme Court to help along their Obamacare repeal scheme, and now they're kinda lost", "title": "GOP\u2019s Obamacare muddle: They want to repeal it, but can\u2019t figure out how", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The GOP banked on the Supreme Court to help along their Obamacare repeal scheme, and now they're kinda lost", "title": "GOP\u2019s Obamacare muddle: They want to repeal it, but can\u2019t figure out how", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/07/10/gops_obamacare_muddle_they_want_to_repeal_it_but_cant_figure_out_how/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/06/mcconnell_ryan_boehner.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The GOP banked on the Supreme Court to help along their Obamacare repeal scheme, and now they're kinda lost", "title": "GOP\u2019s Obamacare muddle: They want to repeal it, but can\u2019t figure out how", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/06/mcconnell_ryan_boehner.jpg", "creator": "@SimonMaloy", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Simon Maloy", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Affordable Care Act, Budget, budget reconciliation, congressional republicans, dynamic scoring, Federal Deficit, John Barrasso, Obamacare, repeal, Republican Party", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "With that self-imposed deadline bearing down, one would think Republicans would be busily working to make good on their promise to force an Obamacare repeal to the president\u2019s desk.\nWay back in March, Republican leaders in the House and Senate agreed upon a new strategy to try and repeal the healthcare law \u2013 they\u2019d nuke it via budget reconciliation.\nIt\u2019s a one-shot tactic that would allow them to push a repeal measure through to passage without having to first overcome a Democratic filibuster.\n), a member of the Senate leadership and a point person on health policy, said there\u2019s no rush to do reconciliation immediately \u2014 and that Senate leaders haven\u2019t decided on how to use the fast-track budget tool.\nThe GOP leadership had previously been wary about going down that road, since it would take away their best tool for getting important, non-symbolic legislation passed."}
