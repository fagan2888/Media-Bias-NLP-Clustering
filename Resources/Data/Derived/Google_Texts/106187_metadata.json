He laughs, he whimpers, the sun gently bathes his face. He has my nose, his dad\u2019s eyes, his own unique genetic syndrome. I talk of his sister\u2019s arrival home for a college break. He listens with hearing amplified through aids. He can\u2019t see or speak. His faint smile tells me he\u2019s content in this moment.\n\nI, however, am using this moment to contemplate motherhood and the heart-wrenching complexity of it. Can a simple Mother\u2019s Day card ever truly capture its anguish and joy? I think of my grieving friends, one whose son is again in the intensive care unit.\n\nAnother mother mourns the death of her child in a tragic accident. A friend who buried a daughter with complex medical issues a year ago, only to have her new baby diagnosed with the same condition. The many, many mothers for whom the joy is too fleeting, too tenuous.\n\nWe are mothers who share a bond built on heartache, sleepless nights, grief and despair. It\u2019s a bond that adheres only so tight, understands only so much, before the reality of our truly unique journeys sets in.\n\nWe are forced to dig deep within our souls, to a place we never knew existed, and pull forth the strength and love and faith to continue moving forward. To do what we need to do. To be mothers we never imagined we\u2019d have to be.\n\nWe can\u2019t do it alone, but it can take great courage to seek help. Isolation breeds depression. If we are fortunate, we\u2019re surrounded by family and friends. But tragedy unmoors people and sometimes they don\u2019t know how to react. So we may need to ask, to initiate and make ourselves even more vulnerable. We need to let medical professionals, educators and therapists support us and to let others gently guide us on our new path, whether it be mourning the loss of a child who was or a child who should have been.\n\nWe see families that appear whole and unscathed and wonder \u201cWhy us?\u201d And then, of course, \u201cWhy not us?\u201d We may feel part of another world, a parallel universe, as we go through the motions of day-to-day living \u2014 as we\u2019re learning to live again.\n\nFrom our loss comes a deeper understanding of life, death, family and motherhood, as well as an incredible gratitude for the supportive relationships surrounding us. We appreciate the acknowledgment of our loss, the appreciation of our strength. But some days, we just want to be normal and blend in. To forget and live in the moment. We learn to see the good in what we have, and cherish the memories of what we had.\n\nIf we let ourselves be defined by our loss, we lose. Still, it becomes part of who we are. We may become advocates, finding meaning in helping others cope or by throwing ourselves into our work and lives. Being busy is a way to cope, to continue on. But there is an inescapable sorrow that never leaves us.\n\nHealing takes community. My Mother\u2019s Day card says \u201cThank you.\u201d Thank you to all the compassionate people who chose a caring profession, who are part of the intricate tapestry of services available to mothers who grieve the death of a child and to mothers like me who grieve the loss of the child who should have been.\n\nMy card celebrates the joys of motherhood. As the sun bathes my son\u2019s face, I am thankful for what is.\n\nHealing takes time and every experience is unique. The void left by a mother\u2019s loss is slowly filled by a quiet warmth and eventually by a joy always tinged with sadness. A greater appreciation for the warmth of the sun and the bonds of community. Bonds that link us all together and make us all stronger.\n\nHappy Mother\u2019s Day.\n\nKaren Roberts is a mother of three in Denver.\n\nTo send a letter to the editor about this article, submit online or check out our guidelines for how to submit by e-mail or mail.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Roberts: The joy and anguish of being a mother", "title": "Roberts: The joy and anguish of being a mother", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/05/08/roberts-the-joy-and-anguish-of-being-a-mother/", "image": {"width": 545, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150508__20150510_Z00_OP10P_ROBERTSp1.jpg", "height": 654}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150508__20150510_Z00_OP10P_ROBERTSp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-05-08T10:26:27+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-23T13:27:59+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Can a simple Mother\u2019s Day card ever truly capture its anguish and joy?\nThe void left by a mother\u2019s loss is slowly filled by a quiet warmth and eventually by a joy always tinged with sadness.\nAnother mother mourns the death of her child in a tragic accident.\nThe many, many mothers for whom the joy is too fleeting, too tenuous.\nKaren Roberts is a mother of three in Denver."}
