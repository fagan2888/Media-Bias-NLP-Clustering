TAKE ACTION: Urge Your Representative to Support Iran Diplomacy, Not War

Yesterday, we encouraged you to call your Representative in the House to ask them to sign a letter supporting the framework deal and opposing war. We’ve got some great news: the letter now has over one hundred signers, including Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, and it will be kept open into next week. However, there’s still more work ahead.

Three months from now, Congress could be taking a vote that would decide whether the U.S. and Iran solve the nuclear crisis or miss a historic opportunity and move toward war. You need to make sure your Representative is on the right side of history.

This letter has the chance to be one of the strongest Congressional statements in support of diplomacy with Iran and against war. But we need you to take one more step. Take action by emailing your Representative and urging them to sign the Schakowsky-Doggett-Price letter today!
