Merriam-Webster has a 12-word definition for menu.\n\nThe phrase \u201cfrom which a customer makes an order selection\u201d opened the door for coupons and advertisements to be included in the mandate.\n\nThe FDA said calories must be listed on coupons if they have the restaurant\u2019s phone number, and advertisements can be \u201cconsidered a menu.\u201d\n\n\u201c[A]dvertising or marketing material (including coupons) generally would not be considered menus or menu boards,\u201d the FDA said. \u201cHowever, in the example of a pizza coupon that includes a phone number or web address where the customer can place an order and that states \u20181 large pepperoni and sausage pizza $9.99,\u2019 the \u2018coupon\u2019 can be used by a consumer to make an order selection at the time a consumer is viewing the coupon (i.e., the coupon includes the name of the standard menu item, price of the standard menu item and a phone number, or web address where an order can be placed).\u201d\n\n\u201cTherefore, in this situation, the coupon would be considered a menu (and not simply a coupon) and would be required to include a calorie declaration for the listed standard menu item,\u201d the FDA said.\n\nThe rule also requires restaurants to post calories for every topping offered at pizza or ice cream chains.\n\nThe American Pizza Community, an association of pizza chains including Domino\u2019s, Papa Johns, Little Caesars, and Pizza Hut, blasted the FDA for not making the calorie labeling rule easier to comply with.\n\n\u201cFDA\u2019s final guidance on the menu-labeling rule confirms our worst fear: it remains as problematic today as it was at its inception,\u201d the group said in a statement. \u201cDespite [The American Pizza Community\u2019s] continued attempts to address concerns with the rule and provide clarity and sensible changes that take into account modern technology, FDA\u2019s final guidance shows that it will continue to push for one-size-fits-all regulations that do little to enhance customer knowledge and create an undue burden on the backs of small business owners.\u201d\n\nThe organization is continuing to call on Congress to pass the Common Sense Nutrition Disclosure Act, sponsored by House Republican Conference Chairman Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R., Wash.). The bill would give businesses greater flexibility in how to display calorie information, such as allowing large pizza chains to post their calorie information online.\n\nThe legislation also clarifies that advertisements, coupons, flyers, window displays, and posts on social media are not menus.\n\n\u201cFDA has had six years to implement this rule and still can\u2019t get it right,\u201d the American Pizza Community said. The group added that the legislation would \u201cprovide our customers with important information, but in a way that is actually useful to them, accurate, and takes into account the business model of small business pizza delivery restaurants.\u201d\n\nThe regulation goes into effect in December 2016 for restaurants, groceries, cafeterias, movie theaters, amusement parks, mall cookie counters, coffee shops, and other food establishments with 20 or more stores.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The FDA issued its final guidance for an Obamacare regulation mandating calorie labeling in restaurants, which includes a 171-word definition of \u201cmenu.\u201d", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Free Beacon", "description": "The Food and Drug Administration issued its final guidance for an Obamacare regulation mandating calorie labeling in restaurants, which includes a 171-word definition of \u201cmenu,\u201d and will apply to", "title": "Final Obamacare Calorie Rule Includes 171-Word Definition of Menu", "url": "http://freebeacon.com/issues/obamacare-calorie-menu/", "image": "http://freebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/AP_080718052329-150x150.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The Food and Drug Administration issued its final guidance for an Obamacare regulation mandating cal", "creator": "@LizWFB", "image": "http://freebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/AP_080718052329-150x150.jpg", "title": "Final Obamacare Calorie Rule Includes 171-Word Definition of Menu", "site": "@freebeacon", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1047859882", "fb": {"app_id": "FB_APP_ID", "pages": 282024895179874}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "BY: Follow @LizWFBThe Food and Drug Administration issued its final guidance for an Obamacare regulation mandating calorie labeling in restaurants, which includes a 171-word definition of \u201cmenu,\u201d and will apply to coupons and advertisements.\nBut drawing the biggest criticism is the government\u2019s definition of menu and strict rules for calorie labeling of toppings.\n\u201cFDA has had six years to implement this rule and still can\u2019t get it right,\u201d the American Pizza Community said.\nThe rule also requires restaurants to post calories for every topping offered at pizza or ice cream chains.\nThe bill would give businesses greater flexibility in how to display calorie information, such as allowing large pizza chains to post their calorie information online."}
