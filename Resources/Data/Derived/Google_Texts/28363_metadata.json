But not that Mount St. Mary\u2019s -- another one: Mount Saint Mary College in Newburgh, N.Y., where professors have watched with interest and empathy the developments at Mount St. Mary\u2019s University in Maryland. (The two institutions are not affiliated, although they are both Roman Catholic.)\n\nBut while administrative fiats and \u201cbunny drowning\u201d at the Maryland campus appear to be driven by that president\u2019s desire to move up in the national rankings, and possibly become less Catholic, fiats at the New York institution may spring from the opposite impulse. The college\u2019s current administration wants to make it more conservatively Catholic, faculty members say, in ways that stray from its long Dominican tradition and diminish its commitment to spiritual diversity, academic freedom and shared governance.\n\n\u201cTo me, the governance structure has begun to emulate the church hierarchy -- this is what the men say, and that\u2019s what you do,\u201d said James Beard, a professor of communication arts at Mount Saint Mary College. \u201cI\u2019ve been here 34 years and I entered a very warm, welcoming, nurturing place, and this is now a hostile place.\u201d\n\nBeard\u2019s retiring this year -- happily, in his words -- but said he still feels \u201ca lot of responsibility for the young faculty members recently brought onto this campus for what they\u2019re inheriting. I don\u2019t want to see this happen.\u201d\n\nFaculty members have lots of complaints about the college\u2019s current administration, particularly the growing role of its Board of Trustees in everyday affairs -- affairs that on most campuses are primarily the domain of the faculty. The board has overturned the recommendations of several recent promotion and tenure committee decisions, and trustees have sat on a faculty search committee. Most recently, this month, faculty members say, Albert J. Gruner, board chair, confronted James Phillips, an associate professor of theater, in his office to ask him why he\u2019d posted what Gruner called \u201cslanderous\u201d comments about the college on his personal Facebook page. The encounter was heated, according to various faculty accounts, and violated an explicit college policy that the faculty communicate with the board through the college president. (The president, Anne Carson Daly, accompanied the board chair to the faculty member\u2019s office, faculty members say, but then left.)\n\nPhillips declined to comment on the matter. But other faculty members say the skirmish was over Phillips\u2019s comments regarding the social media account of a new trustee, Andrew Bournos, who was introduced to the faculty this fall as a \u201csocial media guru.\u201d Perhaps naturally, various faculty members visited his social media accounts -- and found some questionable posts.\n\nOf particular concern to a number of professors was a tweet from June 2013 saying, \u201cAcabo de ver [Spanish for \u2018I have just seen\u2019] Muslims and Jews.\u201d The post included a link to a video from Church Militant, a conservative Catholic website. In the video, Michael Voris, the site\u2019s executive producer, questions Cardinal Timothy Dolan for commenting during a visit to a New York mosque that Muslims and Christians worship the \u201csame god\u201d and must \u201chold on\u201d to their faith. Foreshadowing the Larycia Hawkins debate at Wheaton College in Illinois, Voris said the \u201csame god\u201d statement needed clarification. But he devoted a larger portion of his commentary to the idea that Muslims should hold on to their faith, drawing a distinction between supernatural faith (to which he said true Catholics ascribe, based on their belief in the holy trinity) and reason-based faith. Voris said Muslims and Jews ascribe to the latter.\n\nOf \u201cthe Muslims\u201d in particular, he said, \u201cThey have no supernatural faith, and therefore they have no supernatural act of worship.\u201d Voris continued, \u201cAnd even the Jews, who rejected Jesus as trinity, they rejected God as trinity. They have no faith. And therefore, their worship also is natural, not supernatural.\u201d\n\nFaculty members were taken aback by the statement that Jews \u201chave no faith,\u201d and began to circulate the tweet. They also noted that other videos by Voris, suggested as additional viewing on YouTube, had such titles as \u201cThe Jewish Conspiracy\u201d and \u201cIslam Founded on Murder.\u201d The post was reported to the administration, which, after a some months, determined that Bournos hadn\u2019t \u201cliked\u201d the video -- just tweeted about it -- and therefore hadn\u2019t necessarily endorsed it.\n\nIn an email to faculty members earlier this month, Gruner, the board chair, wrote, \u201cAs I understand it, the trustee instead indicated that he had viewed the video clip, but expressed no opinion as to his feeling regarding its content.\u201d Gruner added, \u201cWe have also consulted with counsel regarding the video and this matter, and have been advised that the trustee\u2019s reference to the video would not constitute the creation of a \u2018hostile environment\u2019 for any employee on the basis of religion.\u201d\n\nConcerned faculty members were disappointed with the response. One Jewish faculty member, who did not want to be named, citing the environment at Mount Saint Mary, said, \u201cIn social media [what Bournos posted] is an endorsement -- you are what you post. \u2026 A couple of emails is not enough. He needs to apologize.\u201d\n\nPhillips wrote of his distaste for the video in a short post on his Facebook page, saying that Voris\u2019s views evidently represent some board members\u2019. It\u2019s unclear how Gruner became aware of the post, but he allegedly told Phillips that it amounted to \u201cslander.\u201d Faculty members said that while Gruner probably meant \u201clibel,\u201d his statements were threatening.\n\nDenying \u2018the Mount\u2019s\u2019 Dominican Roots?\n\nFor professors at Mount Saint Mary, the recent incident was something of the straw that broke the camel\u2019s back -- certainly not the first clue that shared governance and academic freedom might be under threat. Things began to change when Gruner became board chair in 2012, they said, and got worse during the search for a new college president in 2014.\n\nProfessors questioned why that job ad specified that the successful applicant be a \u201cfaithful Catholic willing to embrace the Dominican charism and defend the Gospel,\u201d when the college employs faculty and administrators of a variety of faiths and is an equal opportunity employer, according to state law. They also said there was little apparent interest in any candidate beyond Daly, who\u2019d most recently served as a dean and vice president of academic affairs at Belmont Abbey College, in North Carolina. Professors worried that Belmont Abbey, which vigorously opposed the Affordable Care Act\u2019s contraception mandate for employers, was too conservative and culturally unlike Mount Saint Mary. (Mount Saint Mary also changed its health care policy for employees in ways that make coverage for elective abortions and vasectomies more restrictive, in 2012.)\n\nOne of those professors, Erin Crockett, then an assistant professor of business, shared her concerns about Daly and Belmont Abbey on a faculty Listserv. In a lengthy 2014 memo, she opposed an administrative proposal to add a required religion course to the core curriculum -- which administrators said would benefit its chances at renewal of accreditation by the Middle States Commission on Higher Education -- and said that Daly seemed to be pushing policies endorsed by the Cardinal Newman Society, a conservative Catholic organization. She cited a society report quoting Daly while she was still at Belmont Abbey as stressing \u201cthe importance of departmental mission statements being coordinated with the overall mission statement of the college or university,\u201d including in such fields as biology.\n\nCrockett also said Daly told the advocacy chapter of the American Association of University Professors that she believed in \u201chiring according to mission,\u201d and that that commonly meant that 50 percent of faculty and staff should be Catholic. The AAUP chapter stands by this account, but Daly in an email to faculty members disputed it, saying, \u201cWith regard to hiring for mission, that does not mean hiring only Catholics and does not violate any laws. Hiring for mission means hiring those who are able to integrate the mission into the academic program. So long as accreditors require colleges to document that they are doing that, it will be necessary for colleges to hire faculty who make it possible for schools to comply with this requirement.\u201d Daly also disputed the notion that Belmont Abbey was too conservative or nondiverse, saying faculty, staff and students came from variety of backgrounds.\n\nLast year, Crockett went up for her third-year review. She received a unanimous endorsement from her department and a strong recommendation from the faculty Tenure and Promotion Committee (she doesn't know the exact vote count, but says she was told it was unanimous), but then something went wrong. Daly, who passes her recommendations for promotion and tenure on to the board, recused herself from Crockett\u2019s case, and the board voted her down. Crockett was notified of the decision in March and wasn\u2019t afforded the additional year that many colleges offer candidates who fail to earn promotion and tenure. Her department chair, who was not tenured, also was let go.\n\nCrockett asked for a reason for the decision in writing, a step recommended by the AAUP, and received none, other than a boilerplate email from Gruner saying that the board, after a \u201cdeliberative process,\u201d determined \u201cyour candidacy did not meet the college\u2019s standards for reappointment.\u201d She said that Daly\u2019s recusal allowed the college to sidestep any right to appeal she might have according to college bylaws. The college denies that reappointment decisions are subject to appeal, but admits it has granted previous requests for appeal.\n\nNow a lecturer in business at Rutgers University at New Brunswick, Crockett said she doesn\u2019t know why she was fired, and it\u2019s likely she\u2019ll never find out. But she and several other faculty members believe that she was punished for speaking out against Daly.\n\nSeveral members of the board \u201cwanted to take the school in a much more conservative, Catholic direction,\u201d she said. \u201cBut if this is a business model, I have no idea how they expect it to work in the New York City metropolitan area, recruiting heavily from Staten Island and Long Island. These are kids who want to go to college -- they\u2019re not looking for a religious education.\u201d\n\nStudents protested Crockett\u2019s and the other professor\u2019s departure last year, including by blasting Snoop Dogg\u2019s \u201cGin and Juice\u201d on campus. That\u2019s because another professor was criticized by the administration last year for reading the rap song, which contains an expletive, at a coffeehouse-style event. Protesters also objected to new, single-sex dorms for freshmen, which the college says is a safety precaution.\n\nBeard, the professor who\u2019s retiring, said the message got a little \u201cmuddled,\u201d but the protest indicated students aren\u2019t happy with the direction the administration\u2019s taking, either.\n\nThings haven\u2019t changed this year. Several faculty members said students were briefed by an attorney earlier this year on free speech rights and told they have less freedom than their counterparts at public institutions. Lawyers for the college also have begun to attend regular faculty meetings. Several board members have been sitting on the hiring committee for faculty hiring in business, following Crockett\u2019s and the chair\u2019s departures -- a highly unusual practice that contravenes AAUP policies and procedures recommending that faculty hiring should be the primary domain of professors.\n\nBrenda Krulik, a college spokeswoman, said that a \u201ccouple of board members did sit on the search committee for the chair of the business school, but so did the three senior faculty members in the department and a couple of senior administrators.\u201d That\u2019s not a violation of the faculty handbook, she said, and \u201cmade good sense,\u201d since board members collaborate closely with the business school to raise support in the local business community.\u201d\n\nMount Saint Mary also added another layer of administration with a new executive vice president. Mark Newcomb comes to the college from the University of Saint Thomas in Houston, but prior to that worked as an interim dean at Belmont Abbey.\n\nSometimes colleges buckle down on their religious missions due to concerns about enrollment, to distinguish themselves from similar institutions. But concerned faculty members at Mount Saint Mary say that\u2019s not what\u2019s happening. Rather, they say, administrative ideologies are shaping the college.\n\nCrockett said she thought Mount Saint Mary\u2019s Dominican tradition and culture, which emphasized Catholic values as well as a commitment to diversity of thought and the liberal arts, was \u201cperfect\u201d when she arrived, but that any institution is free to change. But change should happen in a transparent way that includes input from faculty members and students, she said.\n\nThe college denies that any change has been covert, or that it's downplaying its Dominican roots.\n\n\u201cThe trustees, like the president, are firmly committed to shared governance and recognize the important role played by the faculty, administration and the board in advancing the college,\u201d Krulik said via email. \u201cRemaining faithful to the college\u2019s Catholic and Dominican identity is very important to the Dominican sisters and to the members of the Board of Trustees. Part of reason that the Strategic Plan (2015-2019) focuses on the college\u2019s Catholic and Dominican heritage is to address a report from the college\u2019s accreditors, the Middle States Commission, which suggested that the core should strive \u2018to be effective in introducing students to the larger Catholic intellectual tradition \u2026.\u2019\u201d\n\nRegarding changes to faculty meeting protocols, Krulik said that at Daly\u2019s initiative, \u201cfor the first time in the history of the school, over the last year members of the faculty and of the board have met regularly to discuss important campus issues.\u201d The board worked with faculty members to develop the strategic plan, she said, and met separately with faculty members to discuss the nonreappointments last year, as well.\n\nOver all, Krulik said, the board is \u201ccommitted to maintaining and nurturing the Mount\u2019s tradition of welcoming people of all faiths and no faith.\u201d In a letter to students, faculty and staff, for example, she said, Gruner and Daly wrote: \u201cAs you are well aware, the word \u2018Catholic\u2019 means \u2018universal.\u2019 Everywhere across America, Catholic colleges, hospitals, nursing homes and charities of all kinds welcome people of all faiths and of no faith. At the Mount, we have always been -- and continue to be -- proud to continue this tradition.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2016/02/15/mount-saint-mary-college-new-york-debates-faculty-rights-and-mission", "image": "https://www.insidehighered.com/sites/all/themes/ihecustom/images/facebook_icon_large.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Mount Saint Mary College in New York isn't affiliated with Mount St. Mary's University in Maryland, but professors at the former say it's headed down the same path as the latter, with dissenting faculty members dismissed and trustees showing up at search committee meetings.", "title": "Mount Saint Mary College in New York debates faculty rights and mission"}, "msapplication-config": "/IEconfig.xml", "description": "Mount Saint Mary College in New York isn't affiliated with Mount St. Mary's University in Maryland, but professors at the former say it's headed down the same path as the latter, with dissenting faculty members dismissed and trustees showing up at search committee meetings.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "But not that Mount St. Mary\u2019s -- another one: Mount Saint Mary College in Newburgh, N.Y., where professors have watched with interest and empathy the developments at Mount St. Mary\u2019s University in Maryland.\n(The president, Anne Carson Daly, accompanied the board chair to the faculty member\u2019s office, faculty members say, but then left.)\nDenials of due process, punishing faculty members for speaking out against the institution, powerful administrative personalities undercutting decades of tradition -- Mount Saint Mary College has seen it all in recent months, faculty members say.\nBut concerned faculty members at Mount Saint Mary say that\u2019s not what\u2019s happening.\nProfessors worried that Belmont Abbey, which vigorously opposed the Affordable Care Act\u2019s contraception mandate for employers, was too conservative and culturally unlike Mount Saint Mary."}
