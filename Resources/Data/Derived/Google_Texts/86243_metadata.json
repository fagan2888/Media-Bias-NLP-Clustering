Wednesday evening, thousands of industry members had an opportunity to get into the specifics with one candidate.\n\nA coalition of building sector associations participated in the first edition of a presidential teleforum series. Participants spent more than a half hour hearing from presidential hopeful Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida on his policies as they pertain to the industry.\n\nThe teleforum was hosted by the National Association of Manufacturers, Associated Builders and Contractors (ABC), the Associated General Contractors of America, BIPAC, the National Federation of Independent Business and the National Retail Federation. Approximately 7,600 members of the coalition listened in on the call, and a handful were able to pitch questions to the senator during the 45-minute forum.\n\nRubio was asked by a member of ABC about what he would do to address the skilled worker shortage plaguing the construction industry. The senator said society needs to \u201cstop stigmatizing that kind of work. We\u2019ve for too long told young Americans that people who work with their hands are people not smart enough to go to college. And that just isn\u2019t true.\u201d\n\nHe said the country needs a president that \u201ccelebrates these trades\u201d and draws attention to the economic opportunities in the industry, which offers \u201cgood paying jobs \u2026 in many cases better than the jobs people are getting after four years of college.\u201d\n\nThe senator said he will continue to explore the idea of opening up the Federal Pell Grant to students before they graduate high school, so high school students who know they want to work in a particular trade can get the experience and education necessary to be career-ready immediately after high school.\n\nHe talked about \u201cmodernizing higher education, in particular skills training and vocational training in trade schools.\u201d He also pointed to the Latin Builders Association\u2019s charter school as a model for how the skilled worker pipeline can be bolstered. The school trains students in particular trades to develop the skills necessary to work with one of the association\u2019s members or elsewhere in the industry upon graduation.\n\n\u201cI think we need to be doing more of that,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause we do have a shortage of people in these fields and we have a higher education and education system that just isn\u2019t producing the workforce.\u201d\n\nThe forum was very much focused on small businesses.\n\n\u201cOnly five percent of American business activity happens through C corporations,\u201d he said, adding that small- and mid-sized businesses are \u201cthe backbone of our economy. Without that, we basically become a corporatist society and a corporatist economy.\u201d\n\nHe told participants of the forum that he is pushing for tax reform that \u201cprotects small businesses.\u201d He calls for a \u201cdramatic simplification of the tax code\u201d and has proposed all businesses, no matter the size or how they\u2019re organized, pay no more than a 25-percent flat tax rate. Rubio also proposes businesses be able to fully and immediately expense any investment they make.\n\n\u201cIf you make an investment to grow your business, you now have to deduct it on a schedule for depreciation,\u201d he said. \u201c\u2026It\u2019s holding back investments, and it\u2019s also unfair to small businesses [that] can\u2019t carry that cost.\u201d\n\nHe called for \u201cpro-growth regulatory policy\u201d that includes the establishment of a national regulatory budget, which would set an overall cap on federal regulations.\n\n\u201cIt would let Congress vote up or down on regulations that have a major impact on the economy,\u201d he said. \u201cIt also exposes the true cost of regulations on the American economy and small businesses. And it would subject independent agencies like the Federal Communications Commission or the Securities and Exchange Commission to cost-benefit analysis. In the process of doing that, through your elected representatives, it would dramatically increase the ability of small businesses to have input into the regulatory process.\u201d\n\nHealthcare was a particular topic of interest. Rubio said he\u2019ll continue to push for the repeal of the Affordable Care Act, dubbed \u201cObamacare,\u201d which he wants to replace with \u201ca patient-centered alternative that provides flexibility to businesses.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat I\u2019ve called for is putting everyone in charge of their own healthcare decisions,\u201d he said. \u201cYou would be allowed to provide pre-tax money to your employees instead of buying the plan for them. Provide pre-tax money that they can use to buy health insurance from anybody in the country that would sell it to them. And you would also be allowed to create joint pools with other small businesses in the same industry or in the same community that provides the same coverage. These are much better options than what we face right now.\u201d\n\nThe senator said he has called for a \u201ccommon sense balance between worker and employer rights,\u201d as well as the expansion of American-made energy. He was asked about his opposition to the Import-Export Bank, which he said has grown into what he thinks is a corrupt organization.\n\n\u201cI think there are better ways to make our businesses competitive,\u201d he said, \u201cincluding dealing with the tax code, limiting the regulations, making America a cheaper place to manufacture, lowering energy costs\u2026, providing a more skilled workforce\u2026, and of course pursuing free and fair trade agreements that make sure our export products are not discriminated against in the international marketplace.\u201d\n\nAt the end of the call, one participant asked Rubio about the growing threat of cyber attacks and his thoughts on how that issue should be dealt with.\n\nHe said he is a proponent of more interaction and exchanging of information between experts in the private sector and the government. \u201cBecause the truth is, the best people in cyber security are not in government,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re in the private sector.\u201d\n\nRubio was the first presidential candidate to accept the coalition of business groups\u2019 invitation to address and answer questions from its members. The other candidates invited to speak with the groups are (in alphabetical order) former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush; Dr. Ben Carson; former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton; Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas); former HP CEO Carly Fiorina; former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee; Ohio Gov. John Kasich; Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.); and businessman Donald Trump.\n\nStay tuned to USGNN.com\u2122 in the coming weeks and months for continued coverage of the coalition\u2019s teleforums with each candidate.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "associated builders and contractors,associated general contractors of america,bipac,business,construction,economy,manufacturing,marco rubio,national association of manufacturers,national federation of independent business,national retail federation,politics,presidential election", "description": "With the 2016 presidential election a year away, the construction and manufacturing industries are keeping a collective eye on how the candidates\u2019 policies will"}, "article_summary": "Rubio was asked by a member of ABC about what he would do to address the skilled worker shortage plaguing the construction industry.\nParticipants spent more than a half hour hearing from presidential hopeful Sen.
