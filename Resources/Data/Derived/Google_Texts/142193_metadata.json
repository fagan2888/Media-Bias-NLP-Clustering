Every day, employees of non-profits and insurance companies sit at a row of tables along the wall, helping people sign up for insurance plans on the healthcare.gov marketplace.\n\nIt\u2019s almost halftime for the Affordable Care Act\u2019s second annual open enrollment period, during which Americans who are eligible for coverage can sign up for plans that will last through 2015. This year, the enrollment period runs from Nov. 15 to Feb. 15.\n\nThe local effort has faced some of the same challenges as last year, organizers say, such as enrollees without much computer knowledge and blips in the healthcare.gov website. But it\u2019s benefited from innovations such as the permanent enrollment location at Regency Square, which was chosen because it serves as a nexus for several bus lines and because an analysis showed large numbers of uninsured nearby, said Tony Penna, regional organizer at Enroll America, a non-profit with a mission to spread health insurance coverage.\n\nAnother boon to the effort, organizers say, is an increase in partnerships between agencies seeking to cover the uninsured. More than a dozen agencies are helping with the enrollment effort, ranging from the Small Business Association to Aetna and including the city of Jacksonville. The agencies coordinate their efforts through an email listserv and a weekly conference call, said David Weiss, director of communications at the Health Planning Council of Northeast Florida, a local non-profit that\u2019s also involved.\n\n\u201cEverybody is really focused on the same thing: getting the word out to people and making sure they have the right info,\u201d Weiss said.\n\nThe Cover Jacksonville campaign, a city effort to enroll uninsured Jacksonville residents, has also been a boon to the enrollment effort, organizers say. Since it began last summer, the campaign has set up a call center that Jacksonville residents can dial at 211 to sign up for care under the Affordable Care Act and the Florida KidCare plan.\n\nSo far, this year\u2019s enrollment period seems to be going faster than in 2013, when the calamitous rollout of healthcare.gov made it nearly impossible to sign up for coverage.\n\nIn the first week of this year\u2019s enrollments, about 462,000 Americans signed up for coverage on the federal exchange, while another 303,000 people signed up in the second week, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Last year, there were about 365,000 enrollments in the first two months.\n\nIn Duval County, about 33,800 residents enrolled in plans on the Affordable Care Act marketplace last year, according to Enroll America. Another 500 enrolled in Baker County, 4,500 in Clay County, 1,800 in Nassau County, and 6,100 in St. Johns County.\n\nIn 2013, about 147,000 Duval County residents lacked insurance, or 17.2 percent of the population, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. There were about 3,500 uninsured in Baker County, 26,000 in Clay County, 12,000 in Nassau County and 24,000 in St. Johns County.\n\nOn Friday afternoon, three workers were helping enrollees at the Regency Square location, all of them from the First Coast Multi-Lines Agency, which collects commissions from insurance companies for directing consumers to their health plans over the exchange.\n\nOne of the employees, Dondy Vane, has many clients from the Spanish-speaking community, which many organizations are making an effort to reach during the enrollment period. Some Spanish speakers are wary of enrolling because they\u2019re worried that it could lead to the deportation of relatives who aren\u2019t here legally, organizers said. The language barrier is also an issue.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re very skeptical because they don\u2019t understand, and the website can be a little misleading if you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re looking for,\u201d Vane said.\n\nThroughout the afternoon, some shoppers from the mall stepped in for help, such as Susan Goss, of Jacksonville, whose was looking for plans for her two sons, who are in their twenties and have no insurance.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re just too lazy,\u201d Goss said. \u201cThey\u2019re healthy and young and everything, thinking, \u2018I don\u2019t have to bother with that.\u2019 \u201d\n\nOthers had appointments, such as Patricia Lovell, who wanted help finding a new plan after deciding that the $147-a-month one she enrolled in last year was too expensive. She was hoping to find a plan for less than $100 a month.\n\nEven though her plan was too pricey for her liking, Lovell said she was glad to have insurance. She was uninsured before the Affordable Care Act went into effect.\n\n\u201cIt was scary, but still, you have no other choice,\u201d she said. \u201cYou can\u2019t afford it.\u201d\n\nRichard Webner: (904) 359-4370", "article_metadata": {"description": "The abandoned storefront at Regency Square mall is dull and gloomy, with blacked-out windows, fluorescent lighting, and walls that are bare except for a few stickers with the faded logo of a former occupant, Champs Sports.", "application-name": "Jacksonville.com", "og": {"site_name": "jacksonville.com", "description": "The abandoned storefront at Regency Square mall is dull and gloomy, with blacked-out windows, fluorescent lighting, and walls that are bare except for a few stickers with the faded logo of a former occupant, Champs Sports.", "title": "For those seeking health-care coverage, ACA enrollment benefits from Regency Square mall location, increase in partnerships", "url": "http://jacksonville.com/business/2014-12-16/story/those-seeking-health-care-coverage-aca-enrollment-benefits-regency-square", "image": "http://jacksonville.com/sites/default/files/images/sms-default-facebook-share.png", "type": "article"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#426ab2", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://jacksonville.com/files/img/editorial/Win8Tiles/Win8icon70x70tiny1.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://jacksonville.com/files/img/editorial/Win8Tiles/Win8iconLarge1.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://jacksonville.com/files/img/editorial/Win8Tiles/wide310x150.png", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://jacksonville.com/files/img/Win8icon.png", "keywords": "Business", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://jacksonville.com/files/img/editorial/Win8Tiles/Win8icon150x150square1.png", "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"articleid": 633118, "publishtime": "2014-12-16T22:41:44Z"}}}, "article_summary": "The Cover Jacksonville campaign, a city effort to enroll uninsured Jacksonville residents, has also been a boon to the enrollment effort, organizers say.\nIn 2013, about 147,000 Duval County residents lacked insurance, or 17.2 percent of the population, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.\nEvery day, employees of non-profits and insurance companies sit at a row of tables along the wall, helping people sign up for insurance plans on the healthcare.gov marketplace.\nMore than a dozen agencies are helping with the enrollment effort, ranging from the Small Business Association to Aetna and including the city of Jacksonville.\nAnother boon to the effort, organizers say, is an increase in partnerships between agencies seeking to cover the uninsured."}
