I\u2019m thrilled to death, as you can tell.\u201d\n\nSPECIAL COVERAGE: Health Care Reform\n\nAn amendment to the Affordable Care Act required federal lawmakers and their personal staff to forfeit their government-sponsored health care plans and enroll in state-based insurance exchanges. The goal was to make lawmakers experience what many Americans face in the individual marketplace.\n\nBut with the enrollment deadline looming, the complaints are growing louder \u2014 and are aimed particularly at the D.C. small-business exchange that members of Congress are supposed to enroll in.\n\nThe D.C. exchange\u2019s log-in tool experienced technical difficulties Thursday morning.\n\n\u201cSigh. I was just in the middle of signing up,\u201d the chief of staff for Sen. Marco Rubio, Florida Republican, tweeted in response to an internal Senate email about the hiccup.\n\nD.C. Health Link spokesman Richard Sorian said the problem lasted for less than an hour. He noted the exchange has been working with Capitol Hill employees in one-on-one sessions, and that while the system may not be working perfectly, \u201cwe are able to help people shop and enroll.\u201d\n\nOne House Republican aide said Thursday the log-in feature on the website would send members of his office into a Kafkaesque loop that shut them out when they tried to retype their email addresses \u2014 it would say a user already had the address \u2014 or failed to recognize their passwords.\n\n\u201cThese problems are not unique to our office,\u201d he said.\n\nA subplot of the Obamacare debate \u2014 whether health plans cover abortion \u2014 also is creeping into the Hill debate.\n\nRep. Christopher H. Smith, New Jersey Republican, is leading the charge for more transparency, saying it is nearly impossible to tell whether each exchange offers plans that do not cover the services.\n\n\u201cAbortion isn\u2019t health care \u2014 it kills babies and harms women,\u201d Mr. Smith said.\n\nMr. Sorian said two major carriers on the D.C. exchange offer a total of nine plans in the gold tier that do not cover elective abortion.\n\n\u201cAnd they have networks across the country so that helps staff who work in state or district offices who want that kind of policy,\u201d he said.\n\nBut the primary source of Hill controversy has always been who, exactly, must enter the exchanges.\n\nEarlier this week, CNN reported that Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, Nevada Democrat, decided to exempt leadership staff from the exchanges, although he and his personal staff will enroll through Obamacare. His decision follows a strict reading of the law\u2019s provision, but conservatives accused him of excusing aides from a law he led to passage over Republican objections.\n\nOther lawmakers declared all of their staff members exempt from the exchanges by designating them as nonofficial staff.\n\nIn recent months, the Obama administration decided to allow folks on Capitol Hill to keep an employer-based subsidy that defrays up to 75 percent of their premium costs. It also let lawmakers decide which aides were \u201cofficial staff\u201d subject to the exchanges.\n\nMany conservatives jumped on the caveats as underhanded attempts to \u201cexempt\u201d lawmakers from a law they created.", "article_metadata": {"description": "House Speaker John A.
