Obamacare violates rights of individuals

Morality, as I understand it, is choosing to act in a way that is beneficial to my life without harming others. Obamacare is immoral because it uses the power of government, originally designed by the Founding Fathers to protect individual rights, to violate them by forcing taxpayers to act against their own interest by subsidizing others' health care costs with substantial penalties for noncompliance. You cannot create something moral by imposing something immoral.

Dr. Berman also implies that the benefits of Obamacare are "bold" and "moral." Every benefit he lists violates someone's individual rights: insurance company owners by dictating premiums, coverage, and profit margins; hospital owners and health care workers by "eating some of the costs"; but most importantly patients by subjecting them to 13,000 pages of unread, unknown regulations.

As philosopher Ayn Rand said about individuals, "Every one of them has the right to make his own decision but none has the right to force his decision on others." That includes the government or the majority vote. We need to stand for individual rights and keep our health care moral.
