The 29 ports, which handle 70 percent of maritime imports from Asia, were closed over the weekend after months of contentious contract negotiations. The ports reopened Monday, but 20,000 longshoremen are still threatening to strike over a new Obamacare tax.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nObamacare imposes a 40 percent tax on health benefits deemed too generous by the government. Health benefits exceeding $10,200 a year in value for individuals or $27,500 for families are defined as \u201cCadillac\u201d plans and are subject to the tax. Health benefits for longshoremen exceed $40,000 per employee, meaning the union would be served an enormous tax bill when the penalty is imposed in 2018.\n\nThe longshoremen\u2019s contract expired in July, 2014 and contract talks have stalled, in large part, over whether workers or employers will pay the new Obamacare tax. The longshoremen are the first union to negotiate a contract that would extend beyond the time the tax is first imposed.\n\n\u201cThis will come up in just about every contract negotiation out there,\u201d J.D. Piro, a health-benefits consultant, told Bloomberg News. \u201cEvery employer is going to be calculating when and if they hit the threshold and how they\u2019re going to pay for this.\u201d\n\nThe full ramifications of the new \u201cCadillac\u201d health care tax won\u2019t be felt until 2018, two years after the next presidential election. Obamacare was constructed in a deliberate manner, front-loading the \u201cbenefits\u201d of the law and pushing implementation of its \u201ccosts\u201d far into the future, usually after critical elections.\n\nThe emerging debate over the new \u201cCadillac\u201d tax is likely to spark numerous unintended consequences.\n\nThe International Longshore and Warehouse Union has warned about the impact of Obamacare since Democrats first pushed the law through Congress. In 2013, the iconic union quit the AFL-CIO, citing the association\u2019s failure to oppose the tax as a reason for the disassociation.\n\nThe longshoremen last went on strike in 2002, causing a shutdown of West Coast ports that cost the economy more than $2 billion a day in lost output. The strike ended when the Bush Administration went to court, reopening the ports under the Taft-Hartley Act.\n\nThe current impasse over the Obamacare tax overwhelms all other items under negotiation between the union and port management. Current health benefits for employees and their families already cost ports $1.6 million a day. If employers have to absorb the higher costs of the tax, there will be less flexibility for other parts of the contract.\n\nObamacare was passed by Congress almost five years ago. The nation is still three years away from its full implementation. As the drama over the West Coast ports shows, the full economic consequences haven\u2019t even begun.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The slow-roll implementation of Obamacare threatens to close U.S. commercial ports on the West Coast.", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "The slow-roll implementation of Obamacare threatens to close U.S. commercial ports on the West Coast.", "title": "Obamacare Tax Threatens to Close West Coast Ports", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/02/Port-Labor-Shutdown-DAMIAN-DOVARGANES-\u2014-AP-Photo.jpg", "height": 489}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/02/10/obamacare-tax-threatens-to-close-west-coast-ports/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The slow-roll implementation of Obamacare threatens to close U.S. commercial ports on the West Coast.", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/02/Port-Labor-Shutdown-DAMIAN-DOVARGANES-\u2014-AP-Photo.jpg", "title": "Obamacare Tax Threatens to Close West Coast Ports", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "app_id": 1243316582352556, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Obama Tax Increase, obamacare, West Coast,Big Government, Breitbart California, Obamacare,obamacare", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Big Government", "tag": "West Coast", "published_time": "2015-02-10T14:52:53-07:00", "categories": "Big Government,Breitbart California,Obamacare"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477afa6914bd0286fe64da\"", "article_summary": "SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERThe slow-roll implementation of Obamacare threatens to close U.S. commercial ports on the West Coast.\nThe ports reopened Monday, but 20,000 longshoremen are still threatening to strike over a new Obamacare tax.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERObamacare imposes a 40 percent tax on health benefits deemed too generous by the government.\nThe current impasse over the Obamacare tax overwhelms all other items under negotiation between the union and port management.\nAs the drama over the West Coast ports shows, the full economic consequences haven\u2019t even begun."}
