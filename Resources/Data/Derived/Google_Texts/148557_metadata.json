Ron Faber now regrets the intervening 11 months of chemotherapy, radiation, painkillers and side effects that reduced his wife to 67 pounds of frayed nerves. Instead, the pain could have been managed so she could focus on the quality of life.\n\n\u201cI would have rather have had a really okay four-and-a half months than this endless set of treatments,\u201d the stage actor said.\n\nAs they confronted Paula\u2019s terminal diagnosis, the decision the Fabers made is among the most difficult anyone can make. But it turns out that in the New York metropolitan region, patients opt for aggressive treatment much more often than other Americans.\n\n\u201cNew York City continues to lag in serious ways with regards to providing patients with the environment that they want at the end of life,\u201d says Dr. David Goodman, who studies end-of-life care at Dartmouth College\u2019s Geisel School of Medicine.\n\nThe reasons they do this are many, but most experts agree that it has less to do with the unique characteristics and desires of people in New York and New Jersey than the health care system and culture that has evolved here.\n\nThe result: More people dying in the hospital, often in an intensive care unit on a ventilator or feeding tube; more doctor visits leading to tests, treatments and drug prescriptions; and more money being spent by the government, private insurers and patients themselves.\n\nSpecialists at the Dartmouth Healthcare Atlas maintain that one of the main drivers of this phenomenon is quantity: people end up in hospitals here so often, they say, because this region simply has a lot of hospital beds.\n\n\u201cOne of the truisms of healthcare is that whatever resources are available, or whatever beds are built, they tend to get filled,\u201d Goodman says.\n\nA second driver is that every region has its own medical \u201cculture,\u201d and the one in New York is built around highly trained specialists and sub-specialists who see it as their job to cure illness. Dr. Diane Meier says that means, \u201cthat if there\u2019s a cancer it needs chemotherapy, that if there\u2019s heart failure, it needs a procedure.\u201d\n\nMeier is a geriatric specialist at Mount Sinai and the director of the Center to Advance Palliative Care.\n\nShe says also driving the culture of heavy treatment is the high proportion of specialists and sub-specialists who constantly refer patients to each other \u2014 both because that is how they were trained and because it is good for business.\n\n\u201cIf I\u2019m an endocrinologist, if I refer to the cardiologist, the cardiologist will refer back to me for endocrine problems,\u201d says Meier. \u201cIt\u2019s like a cottage industry.\u201d\n\nInsurers, Government Pushing Back\n\nMore and more, though, hospitals are getting a single payment from commercial and government insurers for each patient and losing money when treatments and tests pile up. Meier says hospital care needs to adapt.\n\n\u201cThe sort of open faucet of money, where whatever you do, the more we\u2019ll pay you, and the more complicated thing you do, the more we will pay you, and the more risky thing you do, the more we will pay you \u2013 there\u2019s a recognition now that, really, the party\u2019s over,\u201d she says.\n\nAt Mt. Sinai, the chair of surgery now demands his staff discuss hospice alternatives with terminally ill patients \u2014 and make an electronic note of the conversation that can be tracked. If it does not happen, he demands to know why. Meier said every hospital doctor should follow this example.\n\n\u201cAll of medicine needs to be willing to say, \u2018Why did this person with end-stage dementia have three or four hospitalizations in the last three months of life and die in the intensive care unit? This was a terrible experience for the patient and family. A lot of unnecessary suffering. Over a million dollars cost to the taxpayer. How did that happen?\u2019 \u201d she says.\n\nRon Faber is still asking that question.\n\nA year after his wife Paula died, he still believes her oncologist at Beth Israel Hospital was strangely optimistic about her prospects. Faber acknowledges it was Paula\u2019s decision to fight the cancer \u201cevery inch of the way,\u201d but he thinks she might not have, if her doctors had told her more about the upsides of palliative care and the downsides of aggressive treatment.\n\n\u201cI think they sold her on it,\u201d he says. \u201cShe was so afraid of death that she was ready to buy, and they knew it. And I think it happens a lot.\u201d\n\nHospice had come up before as an option, but the Fabers thought of that only as a place to go and die, and no one had told them otherwise. Then a social worker explained that hospice is something that can happen at home, too. Belatedly, Faber said, the couple chose that option, and hospice workers from the Visiting Nurse Service of New York came to their apartment in Greenwich Village.\n\n\u201cOnce they arrived, it was like putting everything together,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd from that moment on, everything was right.\u201d\n\nIt turned out to be the Fabers\u2019 final five days together, after almost 50 years.\n\nThis story is part of a partnership that includes WNYC NPR and Kaiser Health News .
