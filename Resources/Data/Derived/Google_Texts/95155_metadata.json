He portrayed them as opposed to health care and as threatening to drop a \u201cnuclear bomb\u201d on the nation\u2019s economy, while repeatedly also praising himself as willing to compromise and negotiate.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve shown myself as willing to go more than halfway,\u201d he said adding that \u201cthe more extreme portion\u201d of the GOP blocked House Speaker John Boehner from agreeing to a deal with Obama in 2011.\n\nHe also threw in some condescending remarks, saying, \u201cI\u2019m happy to talk to any of them individually and walk them through exactly why [a default] is irresponsible.\u201d\n\nThe stream of invective and contempt reassures his supporters and motivates them to turn out in the 2014 election, but boosts the GOP\u2019s long-standing distrust of the president\u2019s willingness or political ability to negotiate.\n\nIt also goads the GOP to continue its demand for Obamacare reforms, amid the risk that a backlash by non-ideological swing voters could cost them seats in the 2014 election.\n\nHowever, Obama\u2019s rhetoric hasn\u2019t dramatically shifted the polls, which show that each party\u2019s supporters are united in support of their leaders.\n\nSo far, swing voters see Obama and both parties to blame for the budget stand-off.\n\nThroughout his statements, Obama defended the Senate\u2019s Democratic majority, which has blocked all of the GOP\u2019s government-funding bills and its reforms of Obamacare.\n\nObama emphasized his no-compromise stance by promising to block the GOP\u2019s numerous government-funding bills until the GOP agrees to drop its Obamacare reforms, which include ending a tax on medical devices, and ending lucrative concessions for well-paid congressional staff.\n\n\u201cOf course, I\u2019m tempted [to accept the mini-bills, but]\u2026 if there\u2019s no political heat, if there is no television story on it, then nothing happens.\u201d\n\nHe rejected a suggestion that any budget compromise could include a mandated set of subsequent negotiations. \u201cI don\u2019t know that we need to set up a new committee,\u201d he said.\n\nBut, he added, \u201cI\u2019m prepared to talk about anything\u201d providing the GOP gives in to his demands for an unconditional short-term funding bill.\n\nHe jumped on one reporter\u2019s question about the impact of any so-called \u201cdefault,\u201d by claiming that the public does not understand that any decision to not pay one part of the federal government\u2019s $3.8 trillion budget amounts to a formal welshing on U.S. debts.\n\nUnder the Constitution, all government debts must be paid prior to domestic programs, ensuing that the United States\u2019 creditors will be paid from normal tax revenues, unless the interest payments grow larger than monthly tax receipts.\n\nFollow Neil on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Neil Munro", "description": "'I'm not budging. ...
