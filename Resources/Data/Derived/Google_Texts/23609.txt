Jeffrey Jones is visiting Panama City Beach from Southaven, Mississippi.

Although this is his first Labor Day weekend spent at the world's most beautiful beaches, Jones said the holiday has been a homecoming for him.

"I lived about four years in Pensacola as a child, and still have many friends there," Jones said. "I heard about Keith Urban going to be in concert here. I thought well, I'm going to go down there and see that, and see the beautiful beach again."

While the beaches and country music from Gulf Coast Jam is what brought him here, one reason he said he'll come back is the hospitality.

"The people who live here are very, very nice here," Jones said. "They're very kind and friendly with directions. Staying here has just been wonderful."

After selling out this weekend, staff at the Sugar Sands Inn and Suites say it's been a wonderful weekend for hotels and other beach businesses.

And with the lowest gas prices in 11 years according to AAA, thousands drove in for one last hurrah of the summer.

"We call it the 200-mile club, which everybody within in 200 miles comes to the beach," Sugar Sands Assistant General Manager Rickey Turner said. "It's pretty much our last big weekend before the fall breaks. And we do pretty well."

For Turner, they say they hope to draw more people like Jones down to the Panhandle next Labor Day for some sugar sand, and southern charm.

"You know you've always heard about southern hospitality. This is really truer than what I've seen in the deep south," Jones said.

TripAdvisor named both Destin and Panama City Beach the top two destinations for the Labor Day weekend.

Turner credits a big draw for the weekend to Gulf Coast Jam, which according to the Bay County Tourist Development Council brought in at least 20,000 people per day.
