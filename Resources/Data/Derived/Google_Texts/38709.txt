The Chicago Bulls are close to signing former Nuggets guard Aaron Brooks, ESPN.com’s Marc Stein reported Sunday.

Brooks, a free agent who served as a backup guard for the Nuggets last season, would join former Laker and all-star forward Pau Gasol, as well as Real Madrid star Nikola Mirotic and rookie sharpshooter Doug McDermott if the Chicago deal goes through.

In 29 games with the Nuggets last season, Brooks averaged 11.9 points and 5.2 assists per game, and started the last seven games of the season in place of injured point guard Ty Lawson.

But with limited cap space and roster spots, the Nuggets couldn’t re-sign Brooks, who was acquired from Houston in a trade-deadline deal last February. As The Post’s Chris Dempsey reported near the start of free agency, Brooks wanted more playing time so he could prove he’s worth a multi-year deal.

The terms of his near-deal with Chicago were not reported.
