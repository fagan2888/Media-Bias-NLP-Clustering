A talking head was describing a raging war in the Democratic Party between progressives and centrists.\n\nCentrist Democrats? Aren\u2019t they already extinct?\n\nYes, they\u2019re gone, the dodo birds of politics. But the chattering classes, needing something to chatter about and slow to face facts about their darling liberals, are just discovering that the party of Barack Obama and Bill de Blasio bears little resemblance to the party of FDR, JFK and even Bill Clinton.\n\nOh, please. Some of us have been saying this for years. The Democratic Party has gone so far left that late Senate stalwarts like Henry \u201cScoop\u201d Jackson and Pat Moynihan, lions of liberalism but also of common sense and a strong military, must be spinning in their graves.\n\nOr take Joe Lieberman, who got spun right out of the party. He was the Dems\u2019 vice-presidential nominee in 2000, then drummed out as an infidel in 2006 because he didn\u2019t bail on Iraq when the going got tough.\n\nIn New York City, conventional liberals Christine Quinn and Bill Thompson scrambled to match de Blasio\u2019s radical \u201ctale of two cities\u201d narrative, but were swept aside like yesterday\u2019s trash.\n\nGotham Dems who call themselves fiscal conservatives suddenly are harder to find than the proverbial hen\u2019s tooth. They\u2019re all progressives now, at least as measured by de Blasio\u2019s fat coffers, stuffed by a real-estate industry that secretly says it fears him even as it offers tribute.\n\nAnother indicator is that the Rev. Al Sharpton is the Dems\u2019 new Martin Luther King Jr. Talk about a \u00addecline in standards.\n\nRemaining intra-party fights only concern how extreme the shift will be, as new militants push the Dems closer to pure socialism. Conviction politicians like Obama and de Blasio have no real interest in compromise. Look at the battle between Mass. Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Hillary Clinton.\n\nTo most sane people, Clinton no longer qualifies as a centrist. Five years ago, her muscular talk on foreign policy made her allies with Robert Gates and John McCain. But her role as front lady for the Obama appease-niks turned her muscles into fat and her policy into mush.\n\nYet Clinton is insufficiently committed to the movement, according to the Warren cult. And so true believers are pushing St. Elizabeth, she of the Cherokee cheekbones, to run against St. Hillary for the party mantle in 2016.\n\nThen there\u2019s Sen. Chuck Schumer, who could say seven years ago that he was a defense hawk. That was before he supported Obama\u2019s abdication of global leadership and backed dovish Chuck Hagel for \u00addefense secretary.\n\nNow he\u2019s an ex-hawk, pushing to restrain Israel and rolling over for Obama\u2019s plan to contain Iranian nukes instead of preventing them.\n\nThe lurch left is clear at home, too. The wild, incoherent rage over income inequality isn\u2019t about creating jobs and raising the bottom. It\u2019s about whacking top earners and punishing success. Every tax hike proves insufficient to feed the entitlement beast, so another is demanded. Too much is never enough.\n\nTake the redistribution scheme known as ObamaCare. Virtually every Dem voted to impose a bureaucracy armed with IRS power and incomprehen\u00adsible regulations on a health industry that, despite flaws, was the envy of the world.\n\nThe result is mass confusion, anger and the prospect of a revived Republican Party. ObamaCare also was the spark for the GOP rout in the 2010 midterms, meaning the nation still \u00adrefuses to swallow the law nearly four years after it passed on a party-line vote.\n\nMake no mistake, polarization is real and results from power blocs in both parties moving away from the center. But that doesn\u2019t make them equally guilty.\n\nConservatives revolted over the destructive expansion of government and growing curbs on individual liberty. They take seriously, and sometimes too literally, the Constitution\u2019s limits on federal power.\n\nProgressives recognize almost no limits. They want a bigger government with more power, coming at the expense of individual liberty. Many want the Constitution scrapped or stretched beyond recognition.\n\nIf you\u2019re not sure where you stand, think of Barack Obama as the litmus test. If you\u2019re with him, you\u2019re no hawk or centrist. You\u2019re a progressive. But don\u2019t confuse that with progress.\n\nFighting the good-gov\u2019t fight\n\nGov. Cuomo is taking hits for sloppy work and too much talking by his Moreland Commission, but the panel\u2019s vital mission remains intact. Its digging is producing fresh evidence of corruption that will increase public pressure on lawmakers to disclose conflicts of interest. Already junior legislators are breaking with leaders of both parties to agree that taxpayers deserve to know the sources of outside income.\n\nMost important, Cuomo pledges himself to the fight.\n\n\u201cWhat is legal is the problem,\u201d he told me. \u201cThe leaders designed a system that benefits them. That\u2019s where they make their big money and they won\u2019t give it up without pressure.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cWe need to know who their clients are, especially the ones that have business before the state.\u201d\n\nOne item losing steam is his call for public financing of campaigns. Court decisions are changing the legal landscape and the mayoral race saw a surge of union and independent expenditures. That genie can\u2019t be put back in the bottle.\n\nThe debate is also irrelevant to Albany\u2019s culture of corruption. The notion that campaign financing is the answer is like saying the crooks have to be bribed so they won\u2019t steal.\n\nHere\u2019s a better idea: Let\u2019s expose the crooks and elect honest people. That\u2019s the purpose of the Moreland panel, and stopping halfway would embolden the thieves and waste another generation.\n\nCuomo gets that. \u201cI\u2019m on it,\u201d he vows.\n\nThe Maker & the taker\n\nA friend relates a parable for our times. Jesus descends to Earth and sees three men talking. He approaches the first, a blind man, touches his head, and the man can see. Jesus touches the second man, and his deafness is cured.\n\nJesus approaches the third man, who pushes Him away. \u201cLeave me alone,\u201d the man snarls. \u201cI\u2019m on disability and I want to keep it.\u201d\n\nAbsolutely fib-ulous\n\nThe White House\u2019s belated admission that President Obama did meet his \u201cUncle Omar,\u201d an illegal immigrant, and lived with him, provokes a modest proposal. Since lies are routine with this administration, I suggest a day of amnesty. Pick a day \u2014 say Dec. 31 \u2014 for the administration to confess all and the slate is wiped clean.\n\nThat assumes, of course, officials can be trusted to tell the truth for a full day. That\u2019s probably asking too much.\n\nA story of a different color\n\nIn its story about Russian diplomats stealing Medicaid funds, The New York Times engaged in white ethnic profiling. It wrote: \u201cBrighton Beach, Brooklyn, the center of New York City\u2019s Russian-speaking immigrant population, has one of the highest rates of health- care fraud in the nation.\u201d\n\nWhat will the Times admit next \u2014 that blacks and Latinos commit 95 percent of city murders?
