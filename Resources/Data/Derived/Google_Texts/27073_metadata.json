Phillip P. Puckett speaks in support of a bill during the floor session of the Virginia Senate inside the State Capitol in Richmond earlier this year. (Bob Brown/AP)\n\nVirginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe had run out of options to pull off his marquee campaign promise to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. Even a risky plan to circumvent the legislature had fallen apart.\n\nThat\u2019s when the governor, his top priority defeated, picked up the phone and called the man he blamed for the catastrophe.\n\n\u201cHey, Phil? Terry McAuliffe,\u201d the governor said in a seething voice message to Phillip P. Puckett, a Southwest Virginia Democrat who had quit the state Senate days earlier, throwing control of it to the GOP. \u201cI want you to know we just lost the vote, 20 to 19, in the Senate. Medicaid is done. I hope you sleep easy tonight, buddy.\u201d\n\nPuckett had resigned after discussing jobs for himself and his daughter with Republicans \u2014 and after Democrats had tried to entice him to stay with talk of making his daughter a state agency head or federal judge. Now, it is clear that McAuliffe desperately needed Puckett in the Senate to take the daring step of expanding Medicaid on his own, using budget language the Democratic governor hoped to sneak past Republicans.\n\nIt\u2019s also clear that the episode, which prompted a criminal investigation, has left lasting hard feelings between Democrats and Republicans. Republicans say all the blame and prosecutorial attention have been heaped on them. Democrats say they were cheated out of landmark Medicaid legislation, not to mention Senate control.\n\nVirginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe gestures as he details budget cuts during a news conference at the Capitol in Richmond on Oct. 15. (Steve Helber/AP)\n\nIn the end, Puckett\u2019s resignation exacerbated an increasingly partisan atmosphere in Richmond. Its reverberations are likely to make it more difficult for McAuliffe to work with a GOP-controlled legislature to get anything done during the remainder of his term.\n\nDeadlocked over Medicaid\n\nThe Washington Post interviewed more than a dozen people and reviewed scores of e-mails and text and voice messages to piece together new details about how Puckett\u2019s resignation unfolded. The e-mails were obtained through Freedom of Information Act requests, and the texts and voice mails were each provided or read aloud by at least two individuals who directly saw or heard them.\n\nWhat emerges is this new detail: Even as McAuliffe\u2019s aides were spinning Puckett\u2019s resignation as a sign of nasty Republican deal\u00admaking, they were working desperately to strike a deal of their own to keep Puckett in the Senate \u2014 to protect a secret plan to pass Medicaid expansion without direct legislative approval.\n\nPuckett, a senator since 1998, stepped down in early June while the House and Senate were deadlocked over Medicaid. The timing infuriated Democrats for that reason and for another: He left as Republicans were planning to give his daughter a judgeship and Puckett a top post at the GOP-controlled state tobacco commission. By mid-June, federal officials launched an investigation that, according to several individuals with knowledge of the probe, has focused on Puckett and the commission chairman, Del. Terry G. Kilgore (R-Scott), who had led the hiring effort.\n\nPuckett and Kilgore said at the time that the senator was resigning primarily to clear the way for his daughter to become a judge. The House had twice confirmed Martha Puckett Ketron, an interim juvenile court judge, to a six-year term. But the Senate, citing an anti-nepotism policy, declined to act while her father was in office.\n\nOnly after deciding to quit did Puckett have any serious discussions with Kilgore, a fellow Southwest Virginian and friend, about working for the commission, according to a letter written to prosecutors by Thomas J. Bondurant and Thomas T. Cullen, attorneys for Puckett and Kilgore, respectively. Bondurant and Cullen declined to comment on behalf of their clients for this article.\n\nYet even the interim executive director of the Tobacco Indemnification and Community Revitalization Commission distanced himself from the plan, expressing in e-mails an understanding of how the deal might look once it became public.\n\nThe commission made an intense, highly accommodating push to hire Puckett in late May and early June. Puckett was invited to help create his own job description for a post likely to come with a six-figure salary that would increase his state pension and perhaps allow him to drive a state car, e-mails show.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not aware of the gen\u00adesis of this idea, but Terry has asked us to speak to you,\u201d Tim Pfohl, the interim chief, wrote in his first e-mail to Puckett about the job. Pfohl\u2019s subject line on another e-mail on the topic: \u201cToday\u2019s directive from Terry K.\u201d Pfohl declined to comment for this article.\n\nPuckett had planned to announce on Friday, June 6, that he was quitting the Senate and taking the commission job. The night before, Pfohl urged him in an e-mail \u201cto \u2018decouple\u2019 those announcements for the sake of the appearance of the Commission manipulating the Senate balance of power and starting WW3 w/ the Governor\u2019s administration.\u201d\n\nPuckett opted to wait, but \u201cWW3\u201d was coming anyway. That Thursday night, Pfohl tipped off a member of McAuliffe\u2019s Cabinet, setting off a flurry of e-mails, phone calls and texts.\n\n\u201cTim P. called [Commerce] Secretary [Maurice] Jones today,\u201d Puckett\u2019s son, Joseph, wrote in a text later provided to investigators. Referring to the governor\u2019s chief of staff, he also texted: \u201cPaul Reagan just called dad,\u201d and \u201cReagan has already taken it to the governor and convinced dad to wait on their callback in the morning.\u201d\n\nFrenzied push by Democrats\n\nWhen news reports of Puckett\u2019s resignation broke, Democrats jumped at the chance to lambaste the appearance of a quid pro quo with Republicans. But Virginia\u2019s most powerful Democrats had also launched their own frenzied push to keep Puckett from quitting.\n\nThe Post reported this fall that Reagan and U.S. Sen. Mark R. Warner were also quietly discussing potential jobs as enticements for Puckett to stay. Reagan called Puckett that Thursday and left a follow-up voice message suggesting that Ketron might head a state agency if Puckett stayed put.\n\n\u201cWe would be very eager to accommodate her, if, if that would be helpful in keeping you in the Senate,\u201d Reagan said.\n\nMcAuliffe has said he did not know that Reagan had discussed potential jobs for Ketron until The Post revealed it in October. McAuliffe spokesman Brian Coy said the governor did not get word of Puckett\u2019s resignation plans until that Friday in June \u2014 the day after Reagan first called Puckett. This recollection appears to conflict with the text from Puckett\u2019s son, who wrote that Reagan told his father that he had already taken the matter to the governor. McAuliffe spokeswoman Jamie Radice said there must be some confusion, because the governor distinctly remembers where he was when he got word that Friday: at Dulles Airport, about to fly to the Caribbean for the wedding of Democratic fundraiser Mac Cummings.\n\nEven with his top priority imperiled, McAuliffe could not have easily bowed out of the wedding that weekend: He was officiating. So between landing in Turks and Caicos and declaring, \u201cI now pronounce you husband and wife,\u201d McAuliffe worked the phones.\n\nOn Friday night, McAuliffe called the state Senate\u2019s top Democrat, Richard L. Saslaw (Fairfax). The senator was running an errand at the Potomac Mills mall in Prince William County ahead of a trip to California to see his first grandchild. Until the phone rang, he\u2019d had no inkling his majority-leader status was slipping away.\n\n\u201cTerry said, \u2018Are you sitting down?\u2019 \u201d Saslaw recalled.\n\nSaslaw was sitting \u2014 in his car \u2014 in the mall parking lot. As he wound his way out of the lot, Saslaw called the state\u2019s two U.S. senators. He left Warner a voice mail and reached an aide to Sen. Timothy M. Kaine (D). Saslaw said his plea to both was: \u201cCall Puckett and see if you can fix this thing.\u201d\n\nSaslaw also phoned Puckett directly, leaving a message that asked him to call. He said he did not hear back from Puckett until that Monday, when it was all over. Kaine\u2019s office said he, too, connected with Puckett only after the fact.\n\nWarner reached out to Puckett\u2019s son, Joseph, discussing the possibility of corporate work and a federal judgeship for Ketron, who has practiced law for less than a decade. That call complicated Warner\u2019s bid for reelection, which he narrowly won over Republican Ed Gillespie this month. In one ad, Gillespie declared, \u201cI\u2019d never play politics with a lifetime appointment to the federal bench.\u201d Warner said he \u201cbrainstormed\u201d about potential jobs but never offered any.\n\nSo far, neither Warner nor Reagan has been contacted by prosecutors, their staffs say, leading some in the GOP to grumble that the Justice Department has pursued only potential Republican transgressions. A spokesman for Timothy J. Heaphy, U.S. attorney for the Western District of Virginia, declined to comment for this article.\n\n\u2018He\u2019s understandably angry\u2019\n\nMcAuliffe, still in the Caribbean, also called Puckett. A self-described Irish storyteller, the governor has given a colorful account of their conversation in recent social settings, according to two people he separately regaled. The tale begins with McAuliffe begging the senator to stay and ends with him wishing aloud that Puckett \u201crot in hell.\u201d\n\nCoy, the governor\u2019s spokesman, said McAuliffe never expressed the rot-in-hell sentiment directly to Puckett but conceded that he has voiced it to others.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s understandably angry with Senator Puckett, whose resignation helped cost 400,000 Virginians access to health care,\u201d Coy said.\n\nBut how? Even if Puckett had stayed, the GOP-dominated House was not budging.\n\nThe administration had been searching for a way to get around the legislature but hit a roadblock: The Virginia Constitution requires General Assembly approval for any expenditure, even pass-through funds from Washington.\n\nThen McAuliffe\u2019s camp found an obscure bit of language in the previous year\u2019s budget that appropriated extra Medicaid funds if \u2014 and only if \u2014 a newly formed (and hopelessly deadlocked) state Medicaid commission agreed to expansion. If the language was ripped out of that context, the thinking went, McAuliffe could claim that it authorized him to spend an extra $2 billion a year in federal Medicaid funds.\n\nThere were serious obstacles to the plan even if Puckett had stayed. The strategy would have drawn an immediate legal challenge from Republicans, who had already contended that unilateral expansion would be unconstitutional. But McAuliffe and his team concluded that this was the governor\u2019s best shot, according to four people familiar with the administration\u2019s planning.\n\nIn his voice mail to Puckett, Reagan hinted at the plan: \u201cWe need you to help us get this Medicaid deal through, and I think we\u2019ve got a way to do it.\u201d\n\nBut he did not elaborate. And so to Puckett and most observers, his exit would seem to have no obvious effect on the Medicaid standoff. The Senate would still be in favor, given that three moderate Republicans supported it, and the House still opposed.\n\nResignation becomes public\n\nBy Saturday, June 7, word of Puckett\u2019s pending departure was swirling in the Roanoke convention hall where Republicans from across the state nominated Gillespie to take on Warner. Something was coming, the buzz was. Something big.\n\nLate that Sunday afternoon, Puckett and his wife were in Richmond cleaning out his Capitol Square office, packing keepsakes and tossing the rest into trash cans they had collected from all over the building, said Senate Clerk Susan Clarke Schaar. He had asked Schaar to meet him there, and he handed her his letter of resignation, effective Monday.\n\nSunday evening, Puckett\u2019s resignation became public. The governor\u2019s spokesman, fielding inquiries, stressed the notion that Republicans had been dangling state jobs.\n\n\u201cWorth mentioning that this is state money theyre using in their backroom deal here,\u201d Coy e-mailed one TV station.\n\nCome Monday morning, McAuliffe\u2019s press shop was analyzing how the story was playing for the governor.\n\n\u201cOverall not a bad clip \u2014 highlights \u2018transactional\u2019 agreement and \u2018raises a lot of questions about how business operates in Virginia,\u201d press aide Rachel Thomas wrote as she forwarded an MSNBC piece to Reagan and McAuliffe.\n\nAt the tobacco commission that morning, Pfohl let Kilgore know that he had put the finishing touches\u00ad on Puckett\u2019s job description. Puckett was due to be hired at an executive committee meeting two days later.\n\n\u201cHold up,\u201d Kilgore replied. Amid the uproar, Puckett had bowed out. Ketron\u2019s judgeship stalled, although Republicans say it could come up for a vote in January.\n\nRepublicans moved ahead to capi\u00adtal\u00adize on their coup, claiming control of the Senate that Monday and calling it back into session to approve a \u201cclean,\u201d Medicaid-free budget that Thursday.\n\nStill, McAuliffe\u2019s stealthy Medicaid strategy remained on track, with the budget language tucked inside the hefty bill. The plan was so tightly under wraps that some Democrats who had vowed not to back a budget without expansion were threatening to vote against it.\n\n\u201cTrust us, just do it,\u201d Sen. John S. Edwards (D-Roanoke) said they were told. \u201cI took several aside and said, \u2018We\u2019ve got it figured out.\u2019 \u201d\n\nSo had conservative Bull Elephant blogger Steve Albertson, spotting the language and warning that it was a loophole McAuliffe might try to exploit.\n\n\u201cIf conservatives in the Senate vote for the House budget without fixing this backdoor \u2014 for the governor \u2014 then they will be held responsible for allowing Terry McAuliffe to get away with expansion,\u201d he wrote Tuesday, June 10, concluding with, \u201cWe\u2019re watching.\u201d\n\nBy Tuesday night, it was clear that the tea party could do more than watch. In a stunning upset, then-House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Va.) lost a primary to an underfunded tea-party-backed rival, Dave Brat.\n\nWhen they returned to Richmond two days later, rank-and-file Republicans refused to pass the spending plan with the worrisome language.\n\nHad Puckett been there to vote, the budget would have passed the Senate. Whether McAuliffe\u2019s scheme would have emerged from the House is less clear. Conservative delegates were alarmed by the language, but they risked saddling the GOP with all the blame for a possible government shutdown if they rejected the budget.\n\nShortly before midnight Thursday, a truly \u201cclean\u201d budget cleared the General Assembly and was on its way to the governor. And McAuliffe called Puckett to declare, \u201cMedicaid is done.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The governor needed him to stay in order to take the daring step of expanding Medicaid on his own.", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/laura.vozzella", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "The governor needed him to stay in order to take the daring step of expanding Medicaid on his own.", "title": "Puckett\u2019s Senate exit undid McAuliffe\u2019s secret plan for Medicaid expansion", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/pucketts-senate-exit-undid-mcauliffes-secret-plan-to-pass-medicaid-expansion/2014/11/22/c5edf09e-59f5-11e4-b812-38518ae74c67_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2014/06/09/National-Politics/Images/AP402615230596.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@LVozzella"}, "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "va politics, virginia politics, phil puckett, phillip puckett, medicaid expansion virginina, virginia medicaid, terry mcaulliffe, terry mcauliffe medicaid, terry kilgore, kilgore puckett, mark warner, mark warner puckett, dick saslaw, tim kaine", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/laura.vozzella"}, "eomportal-uuid": "c5edf09e-59f5-11e4-b812-38518ae74c67", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "va politics, virginia politics, phil puckett, phillip puckett, medicaid expansion virginina, virginia medicaid, terry mcaulliffe, terry mcauliffe medicaid, terry kilgore, kilgore puckett, mark warner, mark warner puckett, dick saslaw, tim kaine"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1d0e\"", "article_summary": "Then McAuliffe\u2019s camp found an obscure bit of language in the previous year\u2019s budget that appropriated extra Medicaid funds if \u2014 and only if \u2014 a newly formed (and hopelessly deadlocked) state Medicaid commission agreed to expansion.\n\u201cWe would be very eager to accommodate her, if, if that would be helpful in keeping you in the Senate,\u201d Reagan said.\nPuckett, a senator since 1998, stepped down in early June while the House and Senate were deadlocked over Medicaid.\nDemocrats say they were cheated out of landmark Medicaid legislation, not to mention Senate control.\nAnd so to Puckett and most observers, his exit would seem to have no obvious effect on the Medicaid standoff."}
