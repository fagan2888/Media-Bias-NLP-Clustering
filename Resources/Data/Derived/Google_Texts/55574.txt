We have the nation's Most Wired Hospitals, and we also have America's Most Beautiful Hospitals. We also have national ranking system for hospitals based on their patient engagement efforts.

It's time, I think, to look at the nation's hospitals and their wireless capabilities.

Think about it. Healthcare is moving — some would say gradually, others slowly but surely, others not fast enough — toward a wireless landscape, thanks to the advent of mHealth technology and an ever-more-connected-and-engaged consumer population. Everybody's using their smartphones these days to do more than make phone calls, and healthcare providers are ditching the wires and cables and bolted-down workstations in favor of mobile devices, tablets and BYOD policies.

So who's doing it right? Who's using mHealth to make a difference — in clinical outcomes, patient engagement, staff engagement or ROI? What hospitals are setting examples that the rest of the nation should be following?

I'd like to know. I've already got a few on my own list: Intermountain Health, Partners Healthcare, UPMC, Palomar Health, Scripps Health, Miami Children's Hospital, Mercy Health.

Those are just a few. I’m looking for examples of programs and projects that are working, and why they're working. They can be in large health systems or small clinics, in large cities or remote locations, involving thousands or dozens. Doesn't matter. If they're doing it right, I want to know about them.

Why is this important?

I've heard time and time again that health systems are thinking about embarking on mHealth or telehealth programs, or they're really interested in starting something, but they're hesitant. They want more proof. They don't want to expend the time and effort and money unless they're sure of ROI. In this day and age, any hint of a wasted expense is the kiss of death.

So let's give them the proof they need.
