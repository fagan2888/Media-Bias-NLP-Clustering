Its strength is in its diversity, with families from more than 100 countries, speaking just as many languages. The city boasts the foundation of a dynamic economy and a thriving community.\n\nBut great cities require great schools, and Aurora\u2019s school district is falling dangerously behind. This poor performance threatens to dampen the city\u2019s momentum and, more crucially, leave behind another generation of Aurora\u2019s children.\n\nWe launched RISE Colorado in Aurora Public Schools (APS) in 2013 to empower families to improve our public schools for all of our children.\n\nWe contributed to a report, \u201cIf Not Now: Transforming Aurora Public Schools from Failing to Great,\u201d issued by 17 civic and education groups, whose findings, though not necessarily new, are startling nonetheless and add a sense of urgency to what Aurora Public Schools is doing to improve:\n\n\u2022 All students, but in particular low-income students and students of color, are performing worse in APS than in the rest of the state \u2014 and the gap between APS and the state is widening.\n\n\u2022 Almost half of students in APS do not graduate high school, and only 40 percent of graduates go on to enroll in college. Half of the students enrolling in college need to take remedial courses because they are not prepared for college-level work.\n\n\u2022 APS is in its fourth year of being on the state\u2019s \u201caccountability clock,\u201d and faces losing accreditation if it doesn\u2019t improve.\n\nYes, these challenges are daunting. But with them come opportunity. Struggling districts across the nation are using innovative strategies with impressive results. These strategies, outlined in the report, include high-quality, full-day early childhood programs; robust goal-setting; deep community engagement; development of exemplary new schools, including charter schools; refined curricula that meet the needs of all Aurora\u2019s students; publicly communicated school quality ratings; and aggressive action in turning around the lowest-performing schools.\n\nThese challenges are felt deeply by the community. Two Aurora families, those of Sipinga Fifita Nau and Diana Castro, are prime examples of the types of families APS must better serve. Both are active members of RISE Colorado, and helped craft the report\u2019s language and recommendations, along with other members of the If Not Now Coalition.\n\nNau, whose family is from American Somoa and the Kingdom of Tonga, graduated from Aurora\u2019s Hinkley High School and now has three children in APS. One is a second-grader at Vista Peak; two attend Laredo Child Development Center.\n\n\u201cI hope that with this report, families will realize they have more of a say in their child\u2019s education than they think they do,\u201d Nau said. \u201cI know there is room for growth and improvements. I ask that the district leadership work with families and the community to improve our children\u2019s educational opportunities.\u201d\n\nCastro moved to Aurora from Mexico when she was a teenager. She graduated from Aurora Central High School, and now has two children: a daughter who attends Early Beginnings Zoom Site \u2014 one of only two full-day preschool classrooms in a district building \u2014 and an 11-month-old son.\n\nCastro didn\u2019t go to college and wants her children to have every educational opportunity possible. She helped start the Family Leadership Council at Jamaica Child Development Center, which her daughter attended last year.\n\n\u201cI hope this report helps the district make improvements,\u201d Castro said. \u201cAs a mother of an APS student, it\u2019s very difficult to see these numbers. When I think about the fact that my daughter could be one of the students that doesn\u2019t graduate, it makes me feel sad and upset.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cIf Not Now\u201d report sheds light on the challenges, and also offers a clear path forward for APS. After all, there is really only one acceptable outcome: a school district that engages the community, and implements proven strategies that result in sustainable student growth, academic achievement and higher graduation rates. A district that holds itself accountable, one that is not afraid to ask the tough questions, challenge the status quo and take new approaches. A district that is the pride of the community.\n\nWe must do more to improve APS, and we must do it faster. The families and children of Aurora deserve nothing less.\n\nMilagros Barsallo and Veronica Palmer are co-founders and co-CEOs of RISE Colorado.\n\nTo send a letter to the editor about this article, submit online or check out our guidelines for how to submit by e-mail or mail.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "No: Our schools can go from failing to great", "title": "No: Our schools can go from failing to great", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/10/09/no-our-schools-can-go-from-failing-to-great/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/20151009__20151011_Z00_OP11P_BARSALLOp1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/20151009__20151011_Z00_OP11P_BARSALLOp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-10-09T13:20:58+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-05-21T21:15:53+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb3e5\"", "article_summary": "We launched RISE Colorado in Aurora Public Schools (APS) in 2013 to empower families to improve our public schools for all of our children.\nBut great cities require great schools, and Aurora\u2019s school district is falling dangerously behind.\nTwo Aurora families, those of Sipinga Fifita Nau and Diana Castro, are prime examples of the types of families APS must better serve.\nWe must do more to improve APS, and we must do it faster.\n\u201cI hope that with this report, families will realize they have more of a say in their child\u2019s education than they think they do,\u201d Nau said."}
