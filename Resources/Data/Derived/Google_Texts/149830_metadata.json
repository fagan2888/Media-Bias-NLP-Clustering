Also, 36 Florida doctors have signed up to dispense the low-THC medical marijuana.\n\nIt's been more than a year since lawmakers approved a non-euphoric strain of medical marijuana. But its implementation has been slowed by lawsuits.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re happy this part of the process is over,\u201d said Bruce Knox, president of Central Florida's Knox Nursery, one of the eight nurseries that applied. \u201cIt\u2019s like closing a chapter in a book, I think.\u201d\n\nA spokeswoman for the Florida Department of Health says the agency is committed to getting medical marijuana to children with epilepsy and cancer patients as soon as possible.\n\nSo what happens next? By October, the department has to pick the five nurseries who can grow all of Florida\u2019s crop. Those nurseries then have 10 days to post a $5 million bond, and they must start growing medical marijuana by December 23.\n\nThe growers must have crops processed into medicine for patients by July 20, 2016.\n\nAnother big challenge is getting the word out to the public that this form of medical marijuana is legal, Knox said.\n\n\u201cAmendment 2 failed,\u201d Knox said. \u201cSo most people don\u2019t even know the governor signed a bill into law.\u201d\n\nThe following nurseries have applied to grow medical marijuana in Florida:\n\nMcCrory\u2019s Sunny Hill Nursery; Region: Central\n\nLoop\u2019s Nursery and Greenhouses Inc.; Region: Northeast\n\nKeith St. Germain Nursery Farms; Region: Southeast\n\nPlants of Ruskin; Region: Southwest\n\nDeleons\u2019 Bromeliads Inc.; Region: Central\n\nBill\u2019s Nursery Inc. d/b/a Almond Tree Nursery; Region: Southeast\n\nBill\u2019s Nursery Inc. d/b/a Almond Tree Nursery; Region: Northeast\n\nChestnut Hill Tree Farm LLC; Region: Northeast\n\nCosta Nursery Farms LLC; Region: Southeast\n\nGeorge Hackney Inc. d/b/a Hackney Nursery; Region: Northwest\n\nNature\u2019s Way Nursery of Miami; Region: Southeast\n\nAlpha Foliage Inc.; Region: Northwest\n\nAlpha Foliage Inc.; Region: Southwest\n\nRedland Nursery Inc.; Region: Central\n\nRedland Nursery Inc.; Region: Southeast\n\nHart\u2019s Plant Nursery Inc.; Region: Northeast\n\nHart\u2019s Plant Nursery Inc.; Region: Northwest\n\nSun Bulb Company Inc.; Region: Southwest\n\nTreadwell Nursery; Region: Central\n\nSpring Oaks Greenhouse Inc.; Region: Central\n\nKnox Nursery Inc.; Region: Central\n\nSan Felasco Nurseries, Inc. d/b/a Grandiflora; Region: Northeast\n\nTropiflora LLC; Region: Southwest\n\nDewar Nurseries Inc.; Region: Central\n\nTornello Landscape Corp. d/b/a 3 Boys Farm; Region: Southwest\n\nPerkins Nursery Inc.; Region: Southwest\n\nTree-King Tree Farm Inc.; Region: Northwest\n\nRazbuton Inc.; Region: Central\n\nAbe Aboraya is a reporter with WMFE in Orlando.
