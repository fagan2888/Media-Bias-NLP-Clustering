The run was a breath of fresh air after some wind was taken out of the Marauders' sails when a punt return by Corey Caddle was nullified due to a block-in-the-back penalty.\n\nBut that lead would only last a few minutes before St. Joseph responded with a scoring drive of its own. The Green Knights evened the score at 7-7 when senior Mark Fossati snatched a two-yard pass from classmate Spencer Aukamp in traffic.\n\nFossati\u2019s name would resonate again in the first quarter after he blocked a punt deep in Prep territory. Senior running back Sherman Alston, who wound up with 182 yards on the ground, cashed in on the good fortune, scoring the first of his three touchdowns to make it 14-7 with 3:50 left in the quarter.\n\nBig plays would silence the Marauders crowd on the Green Knights\u2019 next scoring drive as senior wideout Quai Jefferson \u2014 a UMass commit \u2014 and Alston, who has committed to Boston College, broke runs of over 15 yards, giving Aukamp an opportunity to hit his second touchdown pass of the game.\n\nWith his team down 21-7, Prep junior Minkah Fitzpatrick returned the ensuing kickoff 69 yards to the St. Joseph 25-yard line. Fitzpatrick would then catch a pass on a third-and-8, leading to a two-yard touchdown sweep for Hilliman that cut the deficit to 21-14 in the second quarter.\n\nThe Green Knights would not let the Marauders keep the momentum for long though, scoring on the very next drive. It was another possession kept alive on a third and long, as Alston hauled in a 12-yard pass.\n\nThe junior would end that drive, as well as the next Green Knights possession with a short touchdown run, pushing the score to 28-14. Fossati, who caught three touchdown passes in the game, added another score to make it a 35-14 game going into half.\n\nThe Green Knights would keep the pressure on as Aukamp tacked on another two touchdown passes, giving him five for the game, and Alston claimed another rushing score in the second half on the way to victory.\n\nJunior quarterback Brandon Wimbush was contained for most of the game, but was able to break 35-yard run in third quarter. That big gain would be the catalyst to a drive that concluded in Hilliman\u2019s third and final score of the night.\n\nPrep\u2019s crowd gained a little bit of life when junior Dean Perez stripped Alston in the backfield later in the third quarter, but the Marauders stalled after that play, giving the ball back on downs after four plays.\n\nThe final score of the night came with less than five minutes left as Kolton Huber brought in a 10-yard pass from Wimbush.\n\nSt. Joe\u2019s (Mont.)
