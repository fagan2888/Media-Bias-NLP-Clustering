But legislative leaders are taking their time, if they\u2019re trying at all, to get a bill into conference raising the minimum wage. The Senate last November voted to jack the $8 wage floor up to $11 and index it to inflation. The House in early April approved its plan, which calls for a $10.50 per hour minimum wage without the indexing provision. Both branches have also approved separate proposals to change the state\u2019s unemployment insurance rules. If branch leaders don\u2019t begin the usual process of trying to resolve their differences on the issues soon, it\u2019s likely to lend credence to the theory that Beacon Hill Democrats wouldn\u2019t mind seeing a $10.50 minimum wage hike, indexed to inflation but without unemployment insurance system reforms, on the same non-presidential election year ballot where many of them will stand for re-election and Democrats will try to keep the Corner Office as Gov. Deval Patrick moves on to the next phase of his career. A MassINC Polling Group survey of 500 Massachusetts residents released this week showed 53 percent hold favorable opinions of Patrick while only 37 percent believe he should run for president of the United States.\n\nThe likely appointment next week of House negotiators to the domestic violence conference will land that important policy matter in conference committee. Sen. Karen Spilka was named head conferee Thursday on the domestic violence bills (S 1897 and H 4038). Domestic violence bill negotiators are already being called to revisit the House budget, with critics of the spending plan from Jane Doe Inc. on Friday saying the budget fails to adequately fund rape crisis centers, domestic violence emergency shelters and batterer intervention programs and \u201cwill be a step backwards instead of supporting the forward-thinking vision\u201d represented in the policy bill. Activists want the House to \u201ccorrect this disconnect.\u201d The Senate\u2019s approval on Thursday of legislation to address underground natural gas leaks means conferees will likely be designated to merge the Senate and House bills (H 3873 and S 2095) into a single, non-amendable bill.\n\nConference committees have become a black hole for major issues this session. Conferences helmed by House and Senate Democrats have been unable to agree since November on welfare reform (H 3756 and S 1806) and compounding pharmacy regulation (H 3672 and S 1899) proposals that lawmakers described as critical last year. Rep. Brian Dempsey and Sen. Jennifer Flanagan are leading the welfare conference and Rep. Jeff Sanchez and Sen. John Keenan are the chief compounding pharmacy bill conferees.\n\nA conference charged with agreeing on an approach to protect the public from damage caused by products containing mercury has come up empty since being appointed in December. Rep. Anne Gobi and Sen. Stephen Brewer are the chief conferees on the mercury bills (H 3601 / S 1758). Bills calling for early voting and other election system reforms (H 3788 / S 1975) were sent to conference in late January, with Rep. James Murphy and Sen. Barry Finegold as lead conferees.\n\nAnd in the face of warnings from the Patrick administration that scores of public works projects are on hold until a transportation bond bill is approved, a conference named to hammer out an expensive multi-year capital spending bill is still working on it, with Transportation Secretary Richard Davey expressing optimism this week that an accord is close, which would move the state closer to releasing funds for construction season work. Rep. William Straus and Sen. Thomas McGee are leading efforts to reach a consensus on H 3860 and S 2033.\n\nThe conference approach hasn\u2019t been a total failure. Negotiators were able recently to produce a largely non-controversial batch of veterans\u2019 services proposals, which were quickly ratified by the House and Senate and signed into law by Gov. Patrick. And conferees this week produced and sent to the governor a bill blocking a $420 million unemployment insurance rate hike. He\u2019s expected to sign that legislation.\n\nAs the annual budget debate heats up, sponsors of other major bills are still trying to just get their proposals to the floors of either branch. Long-promised legislation to combat gun violence has stalled in the House. Charter school proponents are hoping to pry out of the House Ways and Means Committee a proposal to expand the number of charter schools. Gov. Patrick this week filed an economic development bill, and House Speaker Robert DeLeo is working on his own plan to lift the state\u2019s economy. Proponents of a massive expansion of the Boston Convention and Exhibition Center are trying to push a financing bill through. Meanwhile, the Patrick administration is suddenly in a late-session push to force action on legislation aimed at facilitating long-term utility contracts with the goal of boosting renewable energy sources, arguing greenhouse gas emission reduction goals might not be met without immediate action.\n\nAmid the action, the House on Wednesday is set to welcome four new members and Rep. Jason Lewis is scheduled Thursday to be sworn in to the Senate after winning an April 1 special election. The incoming representatives are Dan Hunt of Dorchester, Dan Ryan of Charlestown, RoseLee Vincent of Revere, and John Velis of Westfield, a Democrat who won the seat formerly held by Republican Don Humason.\n\nOther storylines in the week ahead:\n\n\u2014 MARATHON BOMBING ANNIVERSARY: Tuesday is the one-year anniversary of the April 15, 2013 Boston Marathon bombings that have since shone a spotlight on domestic terrorism, steps that can be taken to protect the homeland and improve counter-terrorism efforts, and vulnerabilities that could be exploited by enemies of the United States. In addition to focusing on heroic efforts that saved lives after two handmade bombs were detonated near the finish line, the week ahead will bring more news about planning and security efforts ahead of the April 21 running of the marathon. A Western New England Polling Institute survey released this week showed 53 percent of adults said they are very confident and 38 percent somewhat confident that law enforcement agencies can keep this year\u2019s marathon safe from violence. Seventy-three percent of those surveyed said the bombing has changed Boston, while 24 percent said the city has not changed. Among those who say the attack changed the city, 62 percent said the change was for the better, 20 percent said the change was for the worse, and 14 percent said the change was for both better and worse. Former U.S. House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Peter King (R-NY) will be in Cambridge Wednesday to talk about terrorism and how to prevent it at former Boston Police Commissioner Edward Davis\u2019 Harvard seminar series.\n\n\u2014 HOUSE BUDGET AMENDMENTS: With House budget debate not scheduled to begin until Monday, April 28 and amendments due Friday, lawmakers, budget stakeholders and anyone with an interest will have two full weeks to look over scores of amendments to the $36.2 billion spending plan unveiled Wednesday by House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Rep. Brian Dempsey. During debate this week on an order laying out special rules for the budget debate, House Republicans said Democrats were imposing unfair constraints on amendments. Gov. Deval Patrick\u2019s budget weighed in at $36.4 billion. The House traditionally tacks on spending during \u201cbudget week\u201d so their plan may end up in the same ballpark as Patrick\u2019s on spending. The amendments were being posted online Friday as they are being submitted: https://malegislature.gov/Budget/FY2015/House/ChamberActions?pg=4&perPage=100.\n\nSATURDAY, APRIL 12, 2014\n\nMARATHON PREPAREDNESS: Boston Mayor Marty Walsh plans a press conference to discuss the city\u2019s preparedness for Tuesday\u2019s Boston Marathon tribute and the actual race on April 21.
