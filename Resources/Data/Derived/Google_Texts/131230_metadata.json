Here is a sneak peak at what the skipper had to say before he left the field injured in the first half.\n\n\u201cWe have got a strong defensive pack. Nate (Myles), Harro (Ash Harrison), Luke Douglas, they\u2019re blokes who are going to be flying out of the line and hurting teams,\u201d Bird said.\n\n\u201cI know the Sharks were struggling to get off their line last week purely because our blokes were putting a lot of effort into our defence.\n\n\u201cIf we can start that at our home ground it can be something we can really make our own and make a bit of a trademark.\u2019\u2019\n\nTitans forward Mark Minichiello has been given until today to overcome a virus that troubled a few players this week, with Ben Ridge to make his first appearance of 2014 if the second rower is ruled out.\n\nGold Coast coach John Cartwright is keen to see more direct play from his playmakers against the Tigers and Bird revealed that controlling Wests skipper Robbie Farah had dominated pre-match discussion.\n\nTitans down injury-hit Sharks 2:10 Play video The Gold Coast recorded an 18-12 win over an injury-ravaged Cronulla at Remondis Stadium.\n\nBird believes the new rule changes have played directly into the hands of hookers like Farah and is wary of the free-flowing dangers presented by a Tigers team many have already written off.\n\n\u201cThe Tigers will be as good as we let them be I think,\u201d Bird said.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re always flamboyant, they will throw a lot of attack at you and they can come from all directions.\n\n\u201c(Farah) can play really direct in behind the markers and that\u2019s something we looked at today, was Robbie finding space in behind the markers and catching blokes napping if they\u2019re not concentrating.\n\n\u201cHe has been the leader there for a long time now and you\u2019ve got to give him the respect he deserves otherwise he will cut you to pieces, especially the new rule changes have really opened up the door for good hookers to take advantage.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "TITANS skipper Greg Bird wants the Gold Coast to turn their home ground into a house of pain this season by putting fear into NRL rivals with ferocious defence.", "generator": "legacy", "og": {"site_name": "CourierMail", "description": "TITANS skipper Greg Bird wants the Gold Coast to turn their home ground into a house of pain this season by putting fear into NRL rivals with ferocious defence.", "title": "Gold Coast Titans skipper Greg Bird envisions Titanic home ground house of pain", "url": "http://www.couriermail.com.au/sport/nrl/gold-coast-titans-skipper-greg-bird-envisions-titanic-home-ground-house-of-pain/story-fniabrr8-1226855680523", "image": "http://resources3.news.com.au/images/2014/03/15/1226855/680495-0f1281f2-ac06-11e3-9d7e-f018f46e0213.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://resources3.news.com.au/images/2014/03/15/1226855/680495-0f1281f2-ac06-11e3-9d7e-f018f46e0213.jpg"}, "site": {"identifier": "@couriermail", "id": "@couriermail"}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive", "fb": {"admins": ",100000875899514", "app_id": 134856659877884}, "articleid": 1226855680523, "keywords": "TITANS skipper, finding space, line speed, sending company, advantage line, defensive pack, hurting teams, Map Reference, TASK INFO, assignment click, computer virus, catch blokes, Wests Tigers, Ben Ridge, John Cartwright, Mark Minichiello, Luke Douglas, Robbie Farah, Greg Bird, Story Assignment, rule changes, real defensive attitude, Assignment Instructions", "article": {"publisher": "News Limited", "publicationdate": "Sat Mar 15 18:14:59 EST 2014", "modified_time": "Sat Mar 15 18:14:59 EST 2014", "author": "Todd Balym"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd4b7f\"", "article_summary": "TITANS skipper Greg Bird wants the Gold Coast to turn their home ground into a house of pain this season by putting fear into NRL rivals with ferocious defence.\nVideoImage Daley Mail: Gold Coast Titans v West Tigers 2:14 Play video Lara Pitt and Laurie Daley preview the round two clash between the Titans and the Tigers.\nTitans down injury-hit Sharks 2:10 Play video The Gold Coast recorded an 18-12 win over an injury-ravaged Cronulla at Remondis Stadium.\nPaul Gallen mic'd up in round one vs Titans 0:52 Play video Cronulla captain Paul Gallen was mic'd up during his side's round one loss to the Titans at Remondis Stadium.\nGold Coast coach John Cartwright is keen to see more direct play from his playmakers against the Tigers and Bird revealed that controlling Wests skipper Robbie Farah had dominated pre-match discussion."}
