Of course, there are distinctions between each case\u2013namely, attending Cornell is optional whereas paying taxes is required. Still, the underlying principle behind the fee implementation and Obamacare are the same: the redistribution of wealth in order to provide \u201cfor the common good,\u201d as Skorton stated. [...] Essentially, both the fee and Obamacare are redistributionist policies which seek to extract from some in order to subsidize others. In some ways, however, the Cornell student health fee is worse, because it\u2019s not only a redistribution of wealth, it is an administrative bailout to the tune of a cool $4 million. It\u2019s a double-whammy of liberal ill-logic and progressive policy.\n\nSome of the most vocal opponents of the fee, Breznick said, are \u201cliberal\u201d students.\n\n\u201cThese are the same students who almost surely all vote for Democrats and support redistributionist, big government policies,\u201d Breznick noted, \u201cbut when it comes to their own pocket books they are suddenly outraged.\u201d\n\nSome students went so far as to \u201coccupy\u201d the university president\u2019s office last week.\n\nBreznick appeared on \u201cFox and Friends\u201d Sunday morning to discuss the issue \u2014 and he labeled many of the protesters hypocrites.\n\n.@CaseyBreznick of @cornellreview and @LegInsurrection: #FightTheFee students who \"vote Dem Party line\" hypocrites pic.twitter.com/52qDiOUp72 \u2014 Legal Insurrection (@LegInsurrection) February 15, 2015\n\nWatch Cornell students protest the fee below (content warning: strong language):\n\nOn Twitter, many people used the hashtag \u201cFightTheFee\u201d \u2014 initially used by student activists to rally against the health fee \u2014 to mock the Cornell students protesting their university\u2019s decision and \u201cwelcome\u201d them to socialism.\n\n#FightTheFee Because some Cornell Students actually believe there is no cost to \"free\" stuff. #UnicornsWishlist \u2014 Larry (@vsgrules) February 15, 2015\n\n#FightTheFee represents young people finding out socialism costs money.
