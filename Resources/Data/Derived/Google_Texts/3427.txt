Under normal circumstances, blackmail is illegal and individuals who use blackmail to extort what they want are normally apprehended and severely punished.

However, the ultraconservative House Freedom Caucus clearly believes that blackmail is an appropriate way to extort what its members can't pass through the democratic process. Our country holds dear the principle that everyone is entitled to his opinion and has a right to express that opinion.

However, no one has a right to resort to blackmail to force others to capitulate to their opinion under threat of something dire happening. Sadly, this is exactly what the conservatives in Congress are doing. Either repeal Obamacare or we will shut down the government. Either defund Planned Parenthood or we will allow the country to default and damage our credit rating. The list could go on.

The individuals engaged in this blackmail must be punished, which in this case means get them out of office as soon as possible. In our legal system, someone who assists others in the commission of a crime is punished as an accessory. Perhaps those who condone legislators who believe blackmail is a legitimate strategy are accessories in the same way.
