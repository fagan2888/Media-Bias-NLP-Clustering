It\u2019s the thickness in the air when you combine failure, anger, humiliation with fresh tears and stale coffee.\n\nThe \u201cAgainst Trump\u201d cabal at the National Review wanted America to believe that it was serving as the protector of conservative values, but the truth always falls in the cracks.\n\nThis crew was only looking to preserve its place among the right-appearing intelligentsia of Washington D.C. and its suburbs.\n\nThe National Review, for all intents and purposes, is dead.\n\nIn their first post-Presumptive Nominee issue, the writing allowed to leak through to their front page appeared wandering and looking for a purpose.\n\n. . . the failings of Ted Cruz.\n\n. . . Little Jonah Goldberg\u2019s \u201cI don\u2019t wanna like Trump\u201d acceptance of reality.\n\n. . . A Trump-Gingrich ticket.\n\nThese are the words of lost souls.\n\nLike most irrelevant politicos and their organizations, the talk will quickly shift to coalition and \u201carmy\u201d building with a purpose to influence Donald Trump and his pick for Vice President.\n\nThis is what the irrelevant do . . . they create irrelevant campaigns to give themselves something to do.\n\nOthers, like Jonah Goldberg, will have to spend a few months mocking the GOP nominee before he realizes that no one really cares.\n\nThen there will be those who will slowly shift and pretend that they were ALWAYS in support of Trump. This is the historic operating procedure of the clowns of the National Review, who failed to endorse Reagan in 1968 but didn\u2019t hesitate to endorse Romney in 2008.\n\nThe group sat back and chose to cowardly endorse no one in \u201992, \u201996 and even 2012.\n\nThat\u2019s because they prefer to be on the \u201cwinning\u201d side of their endorsements, despite living in bubble so thick that they have only called it correctly 50% of the time since 1956.\n\nThat\u2019s what we call a losing record.\n\nBut the brilliantly stupid people who write for the National Review call it wrong on more than just presidential politics.\n\nThese are the neo-cons who backed the invasion and occupation of Iraq under George W. Bush.\n\nThey\u2019re the ones who sat on the sidelines as George W. rammed through the largest budget expansions of any \u201cconservative\u201d president and distracted readers as John Boehner acquiesced on Obamacare and nearly every other desire of Barack Obama from 2008 to today.\n\nDon\u2019t be fooled by their legacy left behind by the eccentric and flamboyantly effeminate William F. Buckley . . . the National Review is the place where writers self-define \u201cconservative\u201d while earning a pay check . . . nothing more and nothing less.\n\nLet their tears flow into the gutter . . . along with their careers.", "article_metadata": {"description": "In the National Review's first post-Presumptive Nominee issue, the writing allowed to leak through to their front page appeared wandering and looking for a purpose.", "generator": "Powered by Visual Composer - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.", "author": "Morgan Mayhew", "og": {"site_name": "Liberty News Now", "description": "In the National Review's first post-Presumptive Nominee issue, the writing allowed to leak through to their front page appeared wandering and looking for a purpose.", "title": "The Sadness that Permeates the National Review - Liberty News Now", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://www.libertynewsnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/National-Review.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-05-05T15:06:50+00:00", "url": "http://www.libertynewsnow.com/the-sadness-that-permeates-the-national-review/article4299", "type": "article"}, "robots": "noodp", "ca_image": "http://www.libertynewsnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/National-Review-150x150.jpg", "article": {"section": "Featured", "tag": "National Review", "published_time": "2016-05-05T10:00:43+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-05-05T15:06:50+00:00"}, "ca_title": "The Sadness that Permeates the National Review", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "But the brilliantly stupid people who write for the National Review call it wrong on more than just presidential politics.\nYou can nearly smell it between the pixels of the National Review Online.\nThe National Review, for all intents and purposes, is dead.\nthe National Review is the place where writers self-define \u201cconservative\u201d while earning a pay check .\nThis is the historic operating procedure of the clowns of the National Review, who failed to endorse Reagan in 1968 but didn\u2019t hesitate to endorse Romney in 2008."}
