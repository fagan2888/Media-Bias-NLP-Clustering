The GOP loves to talk about liberty . Individual freedom, the ability to make one’s own choices without federal intervention, is a constant rallying cry. Why then is Republican Congressman John Fleming of Louisiana now looking to the federal government to block veteran’s access to a drug that has been seen to relieve PTSD and Depression?

Oh, because that drug is medical marijuana.

Speaking on the House Floor last week, Rep. Fleming went after veteran administration doctors and their freedom to make the medically necessary decisions they feel are best for their patients. “As a practicing physician and a veteran myself, the way we approach health care is not to just allow any healthcare provider to do whatever he or she wants to do at the time.” He said. “That is simply not the way health care works.”

This is a change in narrative from the congressman, who’s biggest claim to fame thus far has been his fight against Obamacare. Specifically, he railed against the perceived lack of patient and provider choice under the legislation.

Sponsoring one of many attempts to repeal the law in 2013, the congressman stated, “We want to bring consumer choice back into health care.” Last February, he sponsored another vote that he’d hoped would be “the first step toward restoring real choice to people’s health care.”

It seems that Congressman Fleming, like many of his ilk, only likes “choice” when it fits his current narrative. If healthcare providers want to jack up prices, and only cover conditions they feel like covering, choice in healthcare is his friend. When it comes to the rights of veterans and their doctors to choose a treatment that involves medical marijuana, choice isn’t even on his radar.

For the record, while research is still ongoing, current studies support the theory that smoking cannabis significantly reduces the effects of PTSD. Check out this recent study.
