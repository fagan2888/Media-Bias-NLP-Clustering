Louie Gohmert, R-Texas, one of a core group of Republicans who oppose Obamacare. \u201cThis is a huge piece of evidence to show this can\u2019t work, you will break the system and bankrupt people involved.\n\n\u201cThe hospitals, doctors and insurance companies will be left holding the bag. There will be disagreements over who will pay for what. Lawyers will get involved because we are talking about a lot of money,\u201d he said.\n\nUnder Section 156.270 of the Affordable Care Act, the insured needs to pay a premium for just one month before qualifying for the three-month grace period. The insurance company must pay the claims during the first month of the grace period; during the second and third month doctors and hospitals are left to collect unpaid bills.\n\nThis loophole wasn\u2019t lost on some unnamed individuals who queried the Department of Health and Human Services during an open comment period for the new law in 2011.\n\nWhile officials at HHS did not respond to requests for comment on this story, they did offer a glimpse into their thinking in a March 27, 2012, report contained in the Federal Register.\n\n\u201cHHS will continue to explore options for incentivizing appropriate use of the grace period,\u201d the register said. \u201cHHS will monitor this issue moving forward and will continue to work on the development of policies to prevent misuse of the grace period.\u201d\n\nExperts say the federal government has given people the green light to commit fraud.\n\n\u201cIn a sense, it legalizes fraud,\u201d said Wesley J. Smith, a senior fellow at the Discovery Institute of Human Exceptionalism and a frequent critic of the Affordable Care Act. \u201cIt legalizes putting your burdens on the insurance companies\u2019 shoulders and never paying your premiums. The government wants people to be irresponsible and apparently they want the whole system to descend into chaos.\u201d\n\nIn Massachusetts, where a variation of Obamacare already exists, the problem already has emerged, said Devon Herrick, senior fellow with the National Center for Policy Analysis.\n\n\u201cPeople are signing up and getting care and bailing out,\u201d Herrick said. \u201cI was talking to an insurance agent a few years ago (in Massachusetts). She said once a week she would get a call from a college girl who discovers she\u2019s pregnant and wants health insurance. That\u2019s an example of a condition that you can schedule.\u201d\n\nSome medical professionals are bracing themselves for the worst.\n\nThe Texas Medical Association is educating its members about the loophole and receiving feedback from worried doctors. Many in that state operate on a shoestring budget, sometimes taking out loans to stay in business.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty scary,\u201d said Dr. Stephen Brotherton, president of the Texas Medical Association, and in private practice in Fort Worth. \u201cI fix your torn ACL, you don\u2019t pay for your insurance and three months later you\u2019re off the rolls for non-payment.\u201d\n\nAnd any doctor who is paid by the insurance company during the last two months of the grace period will have to return that money, he said.\n\n\u201cOur overhead is about 50 percent; I get $100 and it costs me $50 to stay in business,\u201d Brotherton said. \u201cThe most obvious solution is anything through the exchange, we\u2019re not taking it.\u201d\n\nThe California Medical Association has taken the step of notifying the American Bar Association about the situation.\n\n\u201cThe more nefarious insureds may take advantage of HHS-acknowledged opportunities to game the grace period and get 12 months of coverage for the price of nine before simply enrolling in a new plan under (Obamacare\u2019s) guaranteed issue requirements,\u201d wrote Association associate director C. Brett Johnson.\n\nHe chronicled a potentially nightmarish situation for a doctor:\n\n\u201cFor instance, an oncology practice generally purchases the drugs to be used in a course of chemotherapy up front \u2014 which can run into the tens of thousands of dollars \u2014 and is then reimbursed by the payor as part of the medical service. Costs such as these are on top of the costs of displacing other patients with coverage.\u201d\n\nSo what can be done about this now? Not much, says Gohmert. Changing the law would require a signature by Obama, and Gohmert holds out no hope for that scenario.\n\n\u201cYou have a president who says doctors are greedy \u2014 they do surgery just so they get the money,\u201d Gohmert said. \u201cThat\u2019s what the president said. That same president will certainly be willing to say, \u2018Greedy doctors are demanding more money \u2013 we just need to have Washington take over all health care.\u2019\u201d\n\nContact Tori Richards at tori@watchdog.org and on twitter @newswriter2.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Watchdog.org", "description": "A little-known provision of Obamacare doles out three months of free health care to individuals who choose to default on their premiums.", "title": "Buy 1, Get 3 Free!
