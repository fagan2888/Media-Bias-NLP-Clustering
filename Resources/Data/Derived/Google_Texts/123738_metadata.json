However, \"they don't get extra rights. They don't get to redefine marriage.\"\n\nCarson did play coy on his political plans for 2016. He said God has a plan for me and \"I'm not sure what the culmination of that plan is.\" In the meantime, he insisted he was having a good time travelling around the country speaking and preemptively rebutted those, presumably members of the PC Police, who said he was just doing it to sell his book. Carson proclaimed he's \"got plenty of money,\" instead he's doing it to turn around the country that's in trouble.\"", "article_metadata": {"pageNum": 1, "description": "In a fiery speech to an adoring crowd at CPAC, Dr. Ben Carson offered conservative red meat on Saturday.", "title": "Ben Carson Fights The PC Police", "resourceType": "dailybeast2/components/pages/article", "contentpath": "/content/dailybeast/articles/2014/03/08/ben-carson-fights-the-pc-police", "twitter": {"site": "@thedailybeast", "card": "summary", "creator": "bencjacobs"}, "environment": "dev", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Beast", "description": "In a fiery speech to an adoring crowd at CPAC, Dr. Ben Carson offered conservative red meat on Saturday.", "title": "Ben Carson Fights \"The PC Police\"", "url": "http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/03/08/ben-carson-fights-the-pc-police.html", "image": "http://cdn.thedailybeast.com/content/dailybeast/articles/2014/03/08/ben-carson-fights-the-pc-police/jcr:content/image.img.2000.jpg/1394304746985.cached.jpg", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": "1703087,30000737,1117577220,1276800108,931159,514915512", "app_id": 189930913679}, "authorIds": "/etc/authors/b/ben-jacobs", "platform": "desktop", "template": "article", "authors": "Ben Jacobs", "wrap": "/content/dailybeast/features/2014/cpac", "article": {"published_time": "2014-03-08T18:25:00.000Z", "author": "http://www.thedailybeast.com/contributors/ben-jacobshtml"}, "parsely-page": "{\"title\":\"Ben Carson Fights \\\\\\\"The PC Police\\\\\\\"\",\"link\":\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/03/08/ben-carson-fights-the-pc-police.html\",\"image_url\":\"http://cdn.thedailybeast.com/content/dailybeast/articles/2014/03/08/ben-carson-fights-the-pc-police/jcr:content/image.crop.410.273.jpg/46476824.cached.jpg\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":\"/content/dailybeast/articles/2014/03/08/ben-carson-fights-the-pc-police\",\"pub_date\":\"2014-03-08T18:25:00+00:00\",\"section\":\"\",\"author\":\"Ben Jacobs\",\"tags\":[]}", "type": "house", "content-type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "publicationDate": 201403081825}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3fd7\"", "article_summary": "If Ben Carson had been a member of NWA, his speech on Saturday at CPAC would be entitled \"Fuck The PC Police.\"\nCrowd PleaserIn a fiery speech to an adoring crowd at CPAC, Dr. Ben Carson offered conservative red meat on Saturday.\nCarson proclaimed he's \"got plenty of money,\" instead he's doing it to turn around the country that's in trouble.\"\nCarson used the speech to refute liberal critics of us who had jumped on controversial remarks, including his 2013 proclamation that \"Obamacare was the worst thing to happen this country since slavery.\"\nHe tooks pains though note that he thinks gays and lesbians should have the same rights as anyone else."}
