And in 2016, I\u2019m going to leave it out all on the field.\u201d\n\nStill, Obama\u2019s final year in office promises to be challenging.\n\nThe president\u2019s biggest battles of 2015 were carefully selected with an eye to securing his legacy: diplomatic deals with Iran and Cuba, an international agreement on climate change, and executive actions on immigration and paid sick leave.\n\nIn 2016, he will have to confront problems not of his choosing, ones largely foisted upon him by the unruly reality of the world at home and abroad \u2014 terrorist attacks, mass shootings and chaos in the Middle East.\n\nObama acknowledged, for example, that the fight against the Islamic State remains difficult. \u201cIn any fight, even as you make progress, there\u2019s still dangers involved,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd ISIL\u2019s capacity both to infiltrate Western countries . . . and the savviness of their social media, their ability to recruit disaffected individuals who may be French or British or even U.S. citizens, will continue to make them dangerous for some time,\u201d he added, using another name for the militant group.\n\nHow the president handles this and other problems could significantly shape the race to replace him, as well as his reputation in the years after he leaves office.\n\n[Recent terror attacks force Obama to reassess, and defend, his strategy]\n\nSome of Obama\u2019s allies believe he has achieved more than he often gets credit for, and they say next year is his last opportunity to communicate those accomplishments to the American people.\n\nSimon Rosenberg, president of the New Democrat Network, said Obama\u2019s remaining task \u201cis to make sure the public understands that this has been a successful presidency. Politically, unless the public views his presidency as successful in 2016, there\u2019s no reason to elect a Democrat.\u201d\n\nBut that will be difficult, given the worrying trends in Syria and Iraq, and a raucous Republican presidential field that will continue to emphasize what is wrong with America and blame Obama for those ills.\n\nThe GOP primary race, coupled with the recent ascendancy of a media-savvy House speaker, Rep. Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.), has introduced a new political dynamic to Washington. And after exercising executive authority on so many fronts, there are far fewer levers left for Obama to pull. The \u201cunfinished business\u201d of his presidency, as Obama put it Friday, is mostly messy.\n\nWhile the president has worked to strengthen America\u2019s ties to Asia and bridge rifts with old enemies such as Iran and Cuba, the new opening to the Muslim world he articulated at the outset of his first term has not materialized.\n\nWith a protracted civil war in Syria, ongoing fighting in Afghanistan that has postponed a final U.S. troop withdrawal and continued insurgent activity in Iraq, Obama has failed to disentangle the United States militarily from the region. In the past year and a half, he has been forced to modestly boost U.S. involvement there.\n\nObama will continue to press his other foreign policy priorities through a stepped-up travel schedule next year, according to aides, with trips to Asia and Latin America. He will also face the question of whether he can fulfill one of his longest-standing campaign promises and close the detention center at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, before he leaves office.\n\nThe president said that while it will be \u201can uphill battle\u201d to persuade lawmakers to bring some of the remaining prisoners to U.S. soil, \u201cthis may be one of those places\u201d where Congress will defy expectations, \u201cbecause we can make a really strong argument Guantanamo continues to be one of the key magnets for jihadi recruitment.\u201d\n\nNow that the Affordable Care Act has survived two Supreme Court challenges and has suffered only a small financial blow in this week\u2019s spending deal, the president plans to press ahead with expanding health-care coverage. Obama noted that new ACA customers \u201care up one-third over last year, and the more who sign up, the stronger the system becomes.\u201d\n\nAnd while Obama will issue fewer big executive orders in 2016, he is poised to finalize several climate-related rules affecting the oil and gas industry as well as heavy-duty trucks.\n\n[Obama\u2019s big win on climate, even as future dangers loom]\n\nBut two of the president\u2019s top domestic priorities, criminal justice reform and expanded free trade, are more in Congress\u2019s control than his own.\n\n\u201cI think the president has very little ability to push his agenda forward on the Republican side,\u201d said Rep. Tom Cole (R-Okla.), who added that he did not expect much action in Congress. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty much small ball domestically, until we have a new president.\u201d\n\nSeveral Republicans, including Cole and Scott Reed, senior political strategist for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said Ryan\u2019s more consistent, positive message will pose a new challenge for the president.\n\n\u201cI think that\u2019s going to give President Obama a match, for the first time in a long time,\u201d Reed said.\n\nRecently, a fractured GOP, whose conservatives have clashed with congressional leaders, aided Obama\u2019s hand by forcing top Republicans to forge compromises with Democrats on key bills. Vin Weber, a GOP lobbyist and former congressman, said that in the recent past, some congressional Republicans have been more interested in \u201cideological purity and consistency rather than finding a strategy that might actually slow down this president.\u201d\n\nObama, who on Friday invited Ryan to come to the White House for a meal in the new year, praised him during the news conference for working with him on this week\u2019s tax and spending deal.\n\n\u201cI will say that, in his interactions with me, he has been professional, he has reached out to tell me what he can do and what he cannot do. I think it\u2019s a good working relationship,\u201d the president said. \u201cAnd I think the system worked. That gives me some optimism that, next year, on a narrow set of issues, we can get some more work done.\u201d\n\nStill, unlike in the run-up to the 2014 midterms, when the White House made a political calculation to pull back from controversial policies out of concern for incumbent Democrats, the new imperative is to sharpen the contrast between the two parties even further.\n\n\u201cHe really feels that he can step out on some issues and take on some tough positions,\u201d said Senate Minority Whip Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.), one of Obama\u2019s closest congressional allies. \u201cAnd I think it\u2019s paid off.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, the lesson we have learned is if you\u2019re not moving forward, you\u2019re moving back,\u201d said Neera Tanden, president of the Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank. \u201cStanding still is not an option for a Democratic president.\u201d\n\nSeveral Republican presidential contenders are already reshaping the public debate over terrorism, refugees and immigration, with ideas Obama has tried to counter. And once his own party settles on a nominee, the president will have to share the stage with another Democrat seeking the same level of prominence.\n\nObama said he will work hard to make sure that Democrat replaces him in the White House.\n\n\u201cI think we will have a strong Democratic nominee. I think that nominee will win,\u201d he said. \u201cI will campaign very hard to make that happen for a whole variety of reasons, because they\u2019re far more likely to share my fundamental vision about where America should go.\u201d\n\nPaul Kane and Greg Jaffe contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The president says he\u2019s \u201coptimistic\u201d about 2016, but thorny challenges and intense politics lie ahead.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/eilperin", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "The president says he\u2019s \u201coptimistic\u201d about 2016, but thorny challenges and intense politics lie ahead.", "title": "For Obama, next year looms with fewer chances for big agenda gains", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/for-obama-next-year-looms-with-fewer-chances-for-big-agenda-gains/2015/12/18/65a55d1a-a019-11e5-8728-1af6af208198_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2015/12/18/National-Politics/Images/Was8990021-3297.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@eilperin"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/for-obama-next-year-looms-with-fewer-chances-for-big-agenda-gains/2015/12/18/65a55d1a-a019-11e5-8728-1af6af208198_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "Obama, Obama Mideast, Obama terrorism, Obama Syria, Obama climate, Obama climate change", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/eilperin"}, "eomportal-uuid": "65a55d1a-a019-11e5-8728-1af6af208198", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "Obama, Obama Mideast, Obama terrorism, Obama Syria, Obama climate, Obama climate change"}, "article_summary": "\u201cI think that\u2019s going to give President Obama a match, for the first time in a long time,\u201d Reed said.\nAnd after exercising executive authority on so many fronts, there are far fewer levers left for Obama to pull.\nObama said he will work hard to make sure that Democrat replaces him in the White House.\nAnd in 2016, I\u2019m going to leave it out all on the field.\u201dStill, Obama\u2019s final year in office promises to be challenging.\nObama acknowledged, for example, that the fight against the Islamic State remains difficult."}
