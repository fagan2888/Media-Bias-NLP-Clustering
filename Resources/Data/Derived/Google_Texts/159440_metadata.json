Pelosi said that this issue should not be a political one, but she is also hoping that House Speaker John Boehner and the rest of the members of Congress will do something.\n\n\u201cA few days ago I would have been more optimistic about comprehensive immigration reform,\u201d Pelosi said. \u201cI thought that we had been finding a way because we have been very patient and respectful of [Boehner] trying to do it one way or another.\u201d\n\nNancy Pelosi added that she doesn\u2019t think Boehner \u201cgives us much reason to be hopeful now,\u201d but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s time to throw in the towel.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s still the month of July,\u201d Pelosi said.\n\nNancy Pelosi didn\u2019t go into details on why she doesn\u2019t think comprehensive immigration reform will be passed this year.\n\nDuring a press conference, Nancy Pelosi addressed what President Barack Obama has called an \u201curgent humanitarian situation.\u201d But Pelosi wanted to avoid calling the situation a \u201ccrisis,\u201d according to a report from Business Insider. Instead, she called it an \u201copportunity\u201d for America to show the values it holds.\n\n\u201cThis is a community with a border going through it,\u201d Pelosi told reporters. \u201cAnd this crisis \u2014 that some call a \u2018crisis\u2019 \u2014 we have to view as an opportunity.\u201d\n\nSince last October, more than 50,000 unaccompanied children have crossed the border illegally, according to a report from Politico. Most were from Central America, and federal law doesn\u2019t allow the U.S. to immediately return minors from \u201cnon-contiguous countries,\u201d which include Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala.\n\nBy law, the children that Nancy Pelosi visited must be transferred to the Health and Human Services Department within 72 hours of their apprehension. After that, the children are sent to different shelters until they can be reunited with family members and wait for their hearing day in immigration court.\n\nMany of the children being held have been kept in inhospitable situations. Nancy Pelosi said what she saw \u201cwas so stunning.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you believe as we do that every child, that every person, has a spark of divinity in them and is therefore worthy of respect, what we saw in those rooms was [a] dazzling, sparkling array of God\u2019s children, worthy of respect,\u201d Pelosi said. \u201cSo\u2026 we have to use the crisis \u2014 that some view as a crisis, and it does have crisis qualities \u2014 as an opportunity to show who we are as Americans, that we do respect people for their divinity and worth.\u201d\n\nIn a related report from The Inquisitr, Nancy Pelosi told Jon Stewart on The Daily Show that she didn\u2019t know why the website for Affordable Care Act had so many glitches.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not my responsibility,\u201d she said.\n\nNancy Pelosi added that she \u201cshared the same concern the public does\u201d and that the website is \u201cgetting better.\u201d\n\n[Featured image credit: AP Photo/J.
