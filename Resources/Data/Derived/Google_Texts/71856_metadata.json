Well, I\u2019m a big geek; like quite a few other people who work on policy issues, I was eagerly awaiting the I.R.S.\u2019s tax tables for 2013, which were released last week.\n\nAnd what these tables show is that elections really do have consequences.\n\nYou might think that this is obvious. But on the left, in particular, there are some people who, disappointed by the limits of what President Obama has accomplished, minimize the differences between the parties. Whoever the next president is, they assert \u2014 or at least, whoever it is if it\u2019s not Bernie Sanders \u2014 things will remain pretty much the same, with the wealthy continuing to dominate the scene. And it\u2019s true that if you were expecting Mr. Obama to preside over a complete transformation of America\u2019s political and economic scene, what he\u2019s actually achieved can seem like a big letdown.\n\nBut the truth is that Mr. Obama\u2019s election in 2008 and re-election in 2012 had some real, quantifiable consequences. Which brings me to those I.R.S. tables.\n\nFor one of the important consequences of the 2012 election was that Mr. Obama was able to go through with a significant rise in taxes on high incomes. Partly this was achieved by allowing the upper end of the Bush tax cuts to expire; there were also new taxes on high incomes passed along with the Affordable Care Act, a.k.a. Obamacare.\n\nIf Mitt Romney had won, we can be sure that Republicans would have found a way to prevent these tax hikes. And we can now see what happened because he didn\u2019t. According to the new tables, the average income tax rate for 99 percent of Americans barely changed from 2012 to 2013, but the tax rate for the top 1 percent rose by more than four percentage points. The tax rise was even bigger for very high incomes: 6.5 percentage points for the top 0.01 percent.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThese numbers aren\u2019t enough to give us a full picture of taxes at the top, which requires taking account of other taxes, especially taxes on corporate profits that indirectly affect the income of stockholders. But the available numbers are consistent with Congressional Budget Office projections of the effects of the 2013 tax increases \u2014 projections which said that the effective federal tax rate on the 1 percent would rise roughly back to its pre-Reagan level. No, really: for top incomes, Mr. Obama has effectively rolled back not just the Bush tax cuts but Ronald Reagan\u2019s as well.\n\nThe point, of course, was not to punish the rich but to raise money for progressive priorities, and while the 2013 tax hike wasn\u2019t gigantic, it was significant. Those higher rates on the 1 percent correspond to about $70 billion a year in revenue. This happens to be in the same ballpark as both food stamps and budget office estimates of this year\u2019s net outlays on Obamacare. So we\u2019re not talking about something trivial.\n\nSpeaking of Obamacare, that\u2019s another thing Republicans would surely have killed if 2012 had gone the other way. Instead, the program went into effect at the beginning of 2014. And the effect on health care has been huge: according to estimates from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the number of uninsured Americans fell 17 million between 2012 and the first half of 2015, with further declines most likely ahead.\n\nSo the 2012 election had major consequences. America would look very different today if it had gone the other way.\n\nNow, to be fair, some widely predicted consequences of Mr. Obama\u2019s re-election \u2014 predicted by his opponents \u2014 didn\u2019t happen. Gasoline prices didn\u2019t soar. Stocks didn\u2019t plunge. The economy didn\u2019t collapse \u2014 in fact, the U.S. economy has now added more than twice as many private-sector jobs under Mr. Obama as it did over the same period of the George W. Bush administration, and the unemployment rate is a full point lower than the rate Mr. Romney promised to achieve by the end of 2016.\n\nIn other words, the 2012 election didn\u2019t just allow progressives to achieve some important goals. It also gave them an opportunity to show that achieving these goals is feasible. No, asking the rich to pay somewhat more in taxes while helping the less fortunate won\u2019t destroy the economy.\n\nSo now we\u2019re heading for another presidential election. And once again the stakes are high. Whoever the Republicans nominate will be committed to destroying Obamacare and slashing taxes on the wealthy \u2014 in fact, the current G.O.P. tax-cut plans make the Bush cuts look puny. Whoever the Democrats nominate will, first and foremost, be committed to defending the achievements of the past seven years.\n\nThe bottom line is that presidential elections matter, a lot, even if the people on the ballot aren\u2019t as fiery as you might like. Don\u2019t let anyone tell you otherwise.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "opinion", "ptime": 20160104032004, "twitter": {"description": "The difference that 2012 made shows us the stakes involved in 2016.", "title": "Elections Have Consequences", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/04/opinion/elections-have-consequences.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000004118792"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "creator": "PaulKrugman", "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/11/12/opinion/krugman-circular/krugman-circular-thumbLarge-v7.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/04/opinion/elections-have-consequences.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000004118792", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/04/opinion/elections-have-consequences.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "opinion", "hdl_p": "Elections  Have  Consequences", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "Jan. 4, 2016", "edt": "NewYork", "org": "Internal Revenue Service", "keywords": "Presidential Election of 2016,United States Politics and Government,Federal Taxes (US),United States Economy,Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (2010),Presidential Election of 2012,Internal Revenue Service,Bush  George W,Obama  Barack,Reagan  Ronald Wilson", "CN": "paul-krugman", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Paul Krugman", "thumbnail_150": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/11/12/opinion/krugman-circular/krugman-circular-thumbLarge-v7.jpg", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "per": "Reagan, Ronald Wilson", "thumbnail_150_width": 150, "byl": "By PAUL KRUGMAN", "thumbnail_150_height": 150, "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "The difference that 2012 made shows us the stakes involved in 2016.", "tom": "Op-Ed", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "CT": "column", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/11/12/opinion/krugman-circular/krugman-circular-thumbStandard-v5.jpg", "description": "The difference that 2012 made shows us the stakes involved in 2016.", "CG": "opinion", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "Jan. 4, 2016", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "Op-Ed", "article": {"author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/opinion/editorialsandoped/oped/columnists/paulkrugman/index.html", "section_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/pages/opinion/index.html", "section": "Opinion", "modified": "2016-01-04", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "tag": "Reagan, Ronald Wilson", "published": "2016-01-04", "section-taxonomy-id": "AD8090D7-4137-4D71-84C8-70DA3BD89778"}, "thumbnail_height": 75, "slug": "04krugman", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20160104130207, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/04/opinion/elections-have-consequences.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/11/12/opinion/krugman-circular/krugman-circular-facebookJumbo-v5.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "The difference that 2012 made shows us the stakes involved in 2016.", "title": "Elections Have Consequences"}, "pdate": 20160104, "des": "Presidential Election of 2012", "nyt-collection": {"tone": "opinion", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/column/paul-krugman", "tagline": "Macroeconomics, trade, health care, social policy and politics.", "uri": "/column/paul-krugman", "display-name": "Paul Krugman", "identifier": "paul-krugman", "type": "column"}, "articleid": 100000004118792, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "Elections Have Consequences", "col": "Op-Ed Columnist", "PST": "Op-Ed"}, "article_summary": "And what these tables show is that elections really do have consequences.\nBut the truth is that Mr. Obama\u2019s election in 2008 and re-election in 2012 had some real, quantifiable consequences.\nFor one of the important consequences of the 2012 election was that Mr. Obama was able to go through with a significant rise in taxes on high incomes.\nAccording to the new tables, the average income tax rate for 99 percent of Americans barely changed from 2012 to 2013, but the tax rate for the top 1 percent rose by more than four percentage points.\nNow, to be fair, some widely predicted consequences of Mr. Obama\u2019s re-election \u2014 predicted by his opponents \u2014 didn\u2019t happen."}
