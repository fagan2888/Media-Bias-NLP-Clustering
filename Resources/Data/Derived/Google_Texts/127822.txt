A 38-year-old registered sex offender has been sentenced to six months in jail after his second eavesdropping conviction.

The Kansas City Star reports Christopher John Symington was accused of taking photos up the skirts of an unsuspecting woman in a Johnson County business. He was sentenced Friday in Johnson County District Court after pleading guilty to breach of privacy.

Symington had previously been placed on probation after a conviction for a similar crime in 2010 at a business in Overland Park. Court records show Symington also has a 2002 statutory sodomy conviction in Missouri in a case involving a 16-year-old girl.
