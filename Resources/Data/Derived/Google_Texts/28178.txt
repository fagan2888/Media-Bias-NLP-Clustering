Republican strategist Karl Rove says Donald Trump has a chance to win the Republican presidential nomination.

“Oh sure, look he’s taken the lead, took the lead in July and held it” Rove told Newsmax TV. “He’s got a chance to win the nomination.”

“I think there are five or six people have a chance. His challenge is: he’s created a high floor but a low ceiling.”

Rove said that Trump’s challenge will be gaining supporters of other Republican candidates that he has criticized harshly.

“Nobody wins the nomination and wins the general election until they have unified and attempted to unify the country,” Rove said.

Rove has not officially endorsed any Republican presidential candidate.

However, it was reported last week that he set up a meeting between Ben Carson and casino tycoon and republican donor Steve Wynn.
