New York-based venture capital firm FirstMark Capital, an existing Gravie investor, also contributed to the latest round, which brings Gravie\u2019s total fundraising to $13 million.\n\nGravie said the funding will allow it to \u201cscale up its operations and expand its services to all 50 states by 2015.\u201d\n\nGravie was co-founded by Abir Sen, who serves as the firm's CEO and is a serial entrepreneur behind such other companies as Bloom Health and RedBrick. Sen was recently profiled in a Twin Cities Business feature story about six young Minnesota millionaires. Learn more about Sen and Gravie here.\n\nOn the heels of the investment, Aberdare Ventures partner Mohit Kaushal is joining Gravie\u2019s board of directors. Kaushal most recently served as chief strategy officer and executive vice president of business development at the West Health investment fund. Kaushal also served as a member of the \u201cWhite House Health IT task force,\u201d a team of health care policymakers in the Obama administration, according to Gravie.\n\nKaushal\u2019s \u201cextensive health care knowledge and work at the White House will help us as we work to transform how people access healthcare in the U.S.,\u201d Sen said in a statement. \u201cOur partnership with FirstMark has been crucial to our early success, and now we are excited to add Aberdare to the team.\u201d\n\nGravie's business model is based in part on the belief that, under the changes brought about by the Affordable Care Act, group insurance plans may no longer be most effective for certain employers or consumers. It works with individual consumers, as well as employers and their workers, to help them shop for the best deal on individual insurance plans.\n\nIn addition to helping people buy insurance, Gravie provides members what it calls \u201cconcierge-level after-sale services\u201d\u2014such as health plan troubleshooting, ongoing consultation, analysis of spending across health care accounts, and assistance in paying bills.\n\nGravie was founded last August. \u201cI'm very impressed by the amount of progress Gravie has made in such a short time,\u201d Kaushal said in a statement. \u201cThe Affordable Care Act has brought in a new era in which the group insurance plan may no longer make the most sense. Individuals who buy insurance on their own are no longer at a disadvantage compared to employer-sponsored coverage, and the individual market may be the right answer for many employers looking to provide coverage to their employees.\u201d\n\nIn 2013, Twin Cities Business hosted a multi-part webinar and e-newsletter series about health care reform. One story that was part of that series focused on small businesses' strategies for dealing with the new health care landscape, and one business owner cited Gravie as a useful tool for helping employees receive coverage while also cutting costs.\n\nOther Recent Fundraising\n\nGravie isn't the only local startup to recently raise funds.\n\nArgos Risk, LLC\u2014a Minneapolis-based maker of Web-based solutions designed to help companies manage credit risk and protect against business identity fraud\u2014disclosed in a recent regulatory filing that it is seeking to raise $1.3 million in a fundraising round, and it has thus far closed on $700,000.\n\nEarlier this month, news surfaced that Minneapolis-based sports software firm Sport Ngin closed on a $15 million round of funding, with plans to bring in $11 million more.\n\nAnd in late February, NxThera, Inc., a Maple Grove-based medical device manufacturer, said that it exceeded its $20 million fundraising goal in a recent financing round.\n\nThose are just a few recent examples.
