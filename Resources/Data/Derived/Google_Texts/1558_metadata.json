(Photo: Rick Murray/For Sumner County Publications )\n\nThe victory that eluded the Station Camp High football team for the first two games of the season was finally achieved on Friday night with a convincing 34-14 win over visiting Antioch.\n\n\u201cWe need to work on capitalizing on opportunities better,\u201d Bison head coach Shaun Hollinsworth said. \u201cWe have a lot of ball left to play.\u201d\n\nAfter a quick three-and-out series by Antioch, the Bisons mounted a nine-play drive that covered 51 yards. It was capped off by an 11-yard quarterback sneak by senior Kyle Anderton.\n\nIt marked the first of three touchdown runs by Anderton.\n\n\u201cOur O-line (offensive line) stepped up big time for us,\u201d Anderton said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have to pass much, because our ground game succeeded.\u201d\n\nThe Bears\u2019 counterattack ended when Bison senior Jacob Norman recovered a fumble by Bears\u2019 quarterback Raekwon Hosey.\n\nIt was through the air that Anderton garnered the Bisons\u2019 second score of the night, hooking up with junior wide receiver Kage Hancock in the end zone for a 3-yard touchdown. Shaw\u2019s point-after touchdown (PAT) kick was good, making the score 14-0 with 5:03 left in the first quarter.\n\nThe Bisons had 12 first downs to the Bears\u2019 six in the first half.\n\nThere were three turnovers between the opponents in the second quarter. Anderton threw an interception to Antioch defensive back Michael Bailey. Station Camp senior Griffin Hammond picked up a Bear fumble, directly followed by Antioch doing the same.\n\nWith 1:07 left in the half, the Bison opted to punt on fourth down, in hopes of pinning Antioch deep with little time. Unfortunately, punter Walt Heatherly\u2019s attempt was blocked, leaving Antioch with possession on the Bison 39 yard line.\n\nWith six seconds left on the clock, Antioch scored on Hosey\u2019s 36-yard touchdown pass to Michael Bailey. Placekicker Erick Aguilar split the uprights for a 14-7 score at the half.\n\nStation Camp (1-2) came out firing on all cylinders in the third quarter. Along with Anderton, senior tailback Josh Gilley played a vital factor in the Bison running game. The duo managed a total 36 yards on the first drive out of the half, with Anderton capping it off with a 1-yard sneak. Shaw\u2019s kick was good, creating a 21-7 margin.\n\n\u201cWatching film, we found holes in their (Antioch\u2019s) defense,\u201d Gilley said. \u201cWe had a good week of practice, which helped us bring things together.\u201d\n\nGilley rushed for 134 yards on 23 attempts. Anderton finished with 80 yards on 20 attempts.\n\n\u201cThey are the heart and soul of our offense,\u201d Hollinsworth said.\n\nAfter two more possessions failed to reach the end zone and effectively seal the game, Station Camp\u2019s defense came to the rescue. Bison junior Payton Anderton batted down two passes, in addition to recording numerous tackles.\n\n\u201cI expected to play hard on our home turf,\u201d Payton Anderton said. \u201cWe played our best game of the year tonight.\u201d\n\nThe fourth quarter saw two more scores from Station Camp. The first was a 1-yard run from Kyle Anderton, and the second was Gilley\u2019s 3-yard touchdown dash to extend the lead to 27 points with less than six minutes remaining.\n\nAntioch\u2019s KaDarius Hyde had a 61-yard scamper that subsequently set up his 3-yard touchdown run to cap the scoring.\n\nThe Bears fell to 0-4.\n\nThe Bison resume District 9-AAA play by hosting Lebanon on Friday.\n\nStation Camp 14 0 7 13 \u2014 34 Antioch 0 7 0 7 \u2014 14\n\nSC \u2013 Kyle Anderton 12 run.
