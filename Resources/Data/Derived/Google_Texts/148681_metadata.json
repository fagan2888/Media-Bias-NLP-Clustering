Gov. Tate Reeves qualified to seek re-election last Monday. His first stop on the campaign trail was east Mississippi where he\u2019s talking about growth in the private sector.\n\n\u201cThe question that needs to be asked is, \u2018What are we doing in local governments?\u2019 They need to be working with our state government to create that environment which encourages private sector businesses to invest capital in this region of the state,\u201d Reeves says.\n\nReeves says it\u2019s up to the state to provide local governments with the tools needed to promote job growth within their own regions.\n\n\u201cOne thing we have to get better at across the state is our local officials have to work together better,\u201d Reeves explains. \u201cOur city officials, our county officials and our state officials all have to be singing from the same hymnal.\u201d\n\nWith Mississippi\u2019s unemployment rate dropping from to 10.5 percent in 2011 to 7.2 percent at the end of 2014, Reeves says current state government has shown the importance of paving the way for businesses.\n\n\u201cWe have a political philosophy which says government does not create jobs. Government\u2019s role is to create an environment which encourages the private sector to invest capital and create jobs,\u201d Reeves says.\n\nReeves says he wants to spread the importance of working together to achieve an overall good.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s extremely important that we\u2019re working together all pulling in the same direction. I think that\u2019s something that can certainly be improved. It\u2019s not unique to this region; it\u2019s true across our state,\u201d Reeves says.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"medium": "video", "description": "Lt. Gov.
