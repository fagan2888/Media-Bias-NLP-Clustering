More Americans say the health law has hurt them instead of helped them, and almost half believe the Affordable Care Act will make health care worse in the long run, not better.\n\nWhile 41 percent of Americans approve of the law, 53 percent disapprove. Compared with survey results from early 2014, more people say the law helped them (10 percent to 16 percent) and more say the law has hurt them (19 percent to 27 percent). Less say it had no effect on their family.\n\n\n\nCourtesy Gallup\n\n\n\nAs expected, opinion follows party lines. While 66 percent of Democrats think the law will have a positive national impact in the long term, only 6 percent of Republicans feel the same.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"zone": "homepage/articles", "keyword": "Data Mine [News]", "title": "Obamacare Will Likely Always Be Unpopular", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "The percentage of uninsured Americans is the lowest on record, but people still hate the ACA.", "title": "Obamacare Will Likely Always Be Unpopular", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/news/blogs/data-mine/2014/10/08/obamacare-will-likely-always-be-unpopular", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/93/20/13834cac471fac541740979ab173/140915-aca-editorial.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"title": "Obamacare Will Likely Always Be Unpopular", "description": "The percentage of uninsured Americans is the lowest on record, but people still hate the ACA.", "card": "summary", "site": "@USNews"}, "site": "news", "date_published": "Oct. 8, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "Lindsey Cook,Pulse,Obama administration,Affordable Care Act,health care reform,Obama, Barack,health care,DatamineHealthcare,Republican Party,Democratic Party,Data Mine [News]", "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "The percentage of uninsured Americans is the lowest on record, but people still hate the ACA."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf742\"", "article_summary": "More Americans say the health law has hurt them instead of helped them, and almost half believe the Affordable Care Act will make health care worse in the long run, not better.\nCompared with survey results from early 2014, more people say the law helped them (10 percent to 16 percent) and more say the law has hurt them (19 percent to 27 percent).\nThe percentage of uninsured Americans is the lowest on record, after taking a deep dip from the April deadline for enrollment in health plans mandated under the Affordable Care Act.\nAfter Obamacare, two-thirds of women have free birth control.\nWhile 66 percent of Democrats think the law will have a positive national impact in the long term, only 6 percent of Republicans feel the same."}
