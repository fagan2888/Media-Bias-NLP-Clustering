She explained that she had suffered from dizziness and shooting pain in her stomach for days.\n\nViorel Florescu / Staff photographer Dr. Jayant Kiriane talks with Lida Maurad, a patient at Bergen Volunteer Medical Initiative.\n\nLida, who lives in Bergen County and speaks only Spanish, is among the working poor of North Jersey and could not make a regular doctor\u2019s appointment, because she doesn\u2019t qualify for government assistance and lacks health insurance.\n\nViorel Florescu/Staff photographer\n\nBut she, and other such residents, have found help in the free treatment accorded at The Bergen Volunteer Medical Initiative, which operates a center at 241 Moore Street in Hackensack, with six exam rooms and a lab as well as a close relationship with five area hospitals where the doctors can send patients for free follow up treatment, said Dr. Arthur De Simone, the program\u2019s medical director.\n\nThe healthcare center is only for adult, low-income residents of Bergen County who do not have health insurance.\n\nOn a recent day, another client, Jonathan Leo of Hackensack, whose arm was in a sling after a mishap while cleaning his apartment windows, read a book with his 4-year-old son, William, in the center\u2019s waiting room of the center while awaiting his appointment.\n\n\u201cThis place helps a lot of people,\u201d he said. \u201cThey really helped me control my cholesterol. Whenever I\u2019m sick, I make an appointment and I come. They are very nice, very professional here.\u201d\n\nAlthough Obamacare was intended to give healthcare to the uninsured, experts estimate that there are 35,000 to 40,000 in Bergen County alone who lack health insurance, say health industry experts. \u201cMany people lack medical insurance for a variety of reasons and, when faced with the choice of buying food for their families or health insurance, they choose food,\u201d said Amanda Missey, executive director of the Bergen Volunteer Medical Initiative.\n\nThe volunteer medical initiative opened in November 2009 to treat Bergen residents with no insurance and little money. What started with a few dozen patients has grown every year, thanks to word of mouth. The center now has a roster of 1,000 patients and logged 5,700 visits last year, said De Simone.\n\nThe center has outgrown its current site and plans to move into larger headquarters nearby within a few months. Its hours, 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. on Mondays through Wednesdays, 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. on Thursday and 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. on Friday, also will be extended so that patients can come in for weekend and evening appointments.\n\n\u201cWe get people from virtually every town in Bergen County,\u201d said Missey. \u201cThe typical patient is a mother who makes approximately $200 a week and can\u2019t afford health insurance and needs to choose whether she wants to feed her kids and pay rent or get health insurance.\u201d Such women almost always opt against health insurance.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a common misconception, that the Obamacare has given everyone healthcare. But that\u2019s not true. For a lot of reasons many people don\u2019t have health insurance. Between 35,000-40,000 people in Bergen County are uninsured,\u201d said Missey. \u201cThey don\u2019t take care of themselves until there\u2019s a crisis. They treat the emergency room as their doctor. So that\u2019s what we are trying to do instead. We are their doctor. We find malignant tumors. We find cancers. We are saving their lives.\u201d\n\nThe center is supported entirely by donations, fundraising and grants. Patients pay nothing for appointments and the center receives no government funding.\n\nMore than 20 physicians, 21 nurses and 8 nurse practitioners volunteer at the center. Patients come in for primary care with everything from routine problems to diabetes and cancer.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very rewarding to volunteer here,\u201d said Dr. Lisa Miller, a retired OB/GYN from Upper Saddle River. \u201cI see eight patients a week, and many of them are repeat patients who I\u2019ve been treating for years, so we have a relationship. There\u2019s a continuity of care.\u201d\n\nAnother client, Gerarda Faison of Mahwah, who works part-time in accounts receivable, came for a routine physical and was grateful for the attention he received.\n\n\u201cI love coming here,\u201d he said. \u201cThey treat you like family.\u201d\n\nEmail: yellin@northjersey.com\n\n", "article_metadata": {"apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "description": "North Jersey residents have found help in the free treatment accorded at The Bergen Volunteer Medical Initiative, which operates a center at 241 Moore Street in Hackensack, with six exam rooms and a lab as well as a close relationship with five area hospitals where the doctors can send patients for free follow up treatment, said Dr. Arthur De Simone, the program\u2019s medical director.", "copyright": "North Jersey Media Group Inc.", "author": "DEENA YELLIN", "og": {"url": "http://www.northjersey.com/cm/2.1593/news/center-in-hackensack-offers-free-care-to-bergen-county-residents-without-health-insurance-1.1377992", "site_name": "NorthJersey.com", "image": "http://www.northjersey.com:80/polopoly_fs/1.1377993!/fileImage/httpImage/bergen-volunteer-medical-initiative.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "North Jersey residents have found help in the free treatment accorded at The Bergen Volunteer Medical Initiative, which operates a center at 241 Moore Street in Hackensack, with six exam rooms and a lab as well as a close relationship with five area hospitals where the doctors can send patients for free follow up treatment, said Dr. Arthur De Simone, the program\u2019s medical director."}, "title": "Center in Hackensack offers free care to Bergen County residents without health insurance", "robots": "noarchive,noodp,noydir", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=446490632", "fb": {"admins": "100002050123125,739916158,1235266096", "app_id": 130358300392751}, "DC.creator": "DEENA YELLIN", "msvalidate.01": "697A26605161B513EFE2AD6E581F4AA8", "google-site-verification": "swyvR_LXSGMOxOz1638gujs38OoVP3sZwJgdjySjnXM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=2.0, user-scalable=yes", "DC.title": "Center in Hackensack offers free care to Bergen County residents without health insurance"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe28ec\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThe typical patient is a mother who makes approximately $200 a week and can\u2019t afford health insurance and needs to choose whether she wants to feed her kids and pay rent or get health insurance.\u201d Such women almost always opt against health insurance.\nThe healthcare center is only for adult, low-income residents of Bergen County who do not have health insurance.\nViorel Florescu / Staff photographer Dr. Jayant Kiriane talks with Lida Maurad, a patient at Bergen Volunteer Medical Initiative.\nThe volunteer medical initiative opened in November 2009 to treat Bergen residents with no insurance and little money.\nThey are very nice, very professional here.\u201dAlthough Obamacare was intended to give healthcare to the uninsured, experts estimate that there are 35,000 to 40,000 in Bergen County alone who lack health insurance, say health industry experts."}
