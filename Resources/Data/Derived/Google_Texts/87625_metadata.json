The protests, confusion and political turmoil forced the Olympia, Washington, institution to strike its tent and go home.\n\nThere is some truth to both accounts. A committee made up of Northern Arapaho and Eastern Shoshone members agitated fiercely against the Evergreen program. On the first day that Evergreen representatives entertained prospective students on campus, the Eastern Shoshone Business Council delivered a cease-and-desist order to the Wind River Development Fund (WRDF), requiring it to stop the development of the reservation-based baccalaureate program.\n\nWRDF notes the order is a resolution, and said it is unenforceable.\n\nYet the council contends WRDF overstepped its authority and acted without tribal authorization to make a deal with Evergreen, the order said. The nonprofit \u201cfalsely claimed to be an authorized representative of the tribe.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want a bunch of non-Indian outsiders coming in here and developing curriculum for our two tribes,\u201d said Wes Martel, a member of the Eastern Shoshone Business Council. Martel was not entirely happy about the content of the program, but he was genuinely miffed that Evergreen had not consulted with the tribe early in the process.\n\n\u201cWhen you come in here on a major effort like that without even consulting the tribes, you\u2019re working against us,\u201d Martel said. \u201cWhen you have a bunch of outsiders trying to drive an issue as important as education, it don\u2019t set too well with our leadership and our educational people.\u201d\n\nSigned and dated March 4, the cease-and-desist order was delivered to the WRDF offices in the Frank B. Wise building in Fort Washakie on March 13, the day the nonprofit first invited potential students for an information session. WRDF went ahead with the session.\n\nMichael Zimmerman, the vice president of academic affairs and provost of Evergreen, then traveled to the reservation to meet with prospective students, his WRDF partners and the tribes. Even after an acrimonious meeting with the Eastern Shoshone Business Council, Zimmerman expressed optimism that the difficulties could be overcome and students would be enrolled in the program. But he changed his mind over the weekend and confirmed Monday, March 31 that he had informed both tribes that his college would not pursue the program.\n\n\u201cMoving forward in an anti-Evergreen and anti-Wind River Development Fund environment would do more harm than good,\u201d said Zimmerman. \u201cI don\u2019t see any alternative for us.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "A program that has helped Natives earn bachelor\u2019s degrees on a number of reservations in Washington State won't bring classes to Fort Washakie.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/05/26/evergreen-state-college-drops-ba-degree-plan-reservation-155007", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/article_media/the-evergreen-state-college.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "Evergreen State College Drops BA Degree Plan For Reservation"}, "robots": "follow, index", "dc": {"title": "Evergreen State College Drops BA Degree Plan For Reservation"}, "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/05/26/evergreen-state-college-drops-ba-degree-plan-reservation-155007", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.creator": "leeanne", "dcterms.date": "2014-05-26T15:00-04:00", "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Evergreen State College, Washington State, Native American students, Native American Education, Wind River Reservation", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 2}, "dcterms.title": "Evergreen State College Drops BA Degree Plan For Reservation"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0532\"", "article_summary": "A committee made up of Northern Arapaho and Eastern Shoshone members agitated fiercely against the Evergreen program.\nYet the council contends WRDF overstepped its authority and acted without tribal authorization to make a deal with Evergreen, the order said.\nMichael Zimmerman, the vice president of academic affairs and provost of Evergreen, then traveled to the reservation to meet with prospective students, his WRDF partners and the tribes.\n\u201cMoving forward in an anti-Evergreen and anti-Wind River Development Fund environment would do more harm than good,\u201d said Zimmerman.\nEven after an acrimonious meeting with the Eastern Shoshone Business Council, Zimmerman expressed optimism that the difficulties could be overcome and students would be enrolled in the program."}
