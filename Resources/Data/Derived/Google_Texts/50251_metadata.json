Ardent conservatives, including those in the Tea Party movement, regard the Capitol as a cesspool of corruption, and they see compromise as betrayal.\u201d The lines come from Toobin\u2019s profile of Senator Ted Cruz, featured in the June 30 issue of The New Yorker. You will have no trouble guessing to which group Toobin thinks the senator belongs.\n\nThen again, compared with the last major New Yorker story on Cruz, \u201cIs Senator Ted Cruz Our New McCarthy?,\u201d Toobin\u2019s profile is downright glowing. The CNN legal analyst and New Yorker staff writer interviewed Cruz for the essay, as well as former professors, classmates, and colleagues. \u201cCompletely brilliant\u201d \u2014 Harvard Law School professor Alan Dershowitz\u2019s description of his former student \u2014 is the near-universal sentiment of Cruz intimates, even his ideological opponents. Toobin himself does seem to find Cruz impressive, in a supervillain-on-the-rise sort of way. Cruz is, Toobin summarizes, \u201cthe far right\u2019s most formidable advocate.\u201d\n\nAt one point Toobin quotes Cruz\u2019s guiding dictum, borrowed from the Chinese military strategist Sun Tzu: \u201cI think the essential battle,\u201d says Cruz, \u201cis the meta-battle of framing the narrative.\u201d Toobin clearly agrees. And, like much of the Left, he wants to frame Cruz as the \u201cid of the Republican Party\u201d \u2014 an impulsive, uncompromising, far-right absolutist. In fact, \u201cThe Absolutist\u201d is the title of the piece.\n\nWhat is Cruz \u201cabsolute\u201d about? \u201cHe denies the existence of man-made climate change, opposes comprehensive immigration reform, rejects marriage equality, and, of course, demands the repeal of \u2018every blessed word of Obamacare\u2019\u201d \u2014 all positions that, according to Toobin, put him increasingly out of step with most Americans. Citing Cruz\u2019s part in last October\u2019s federal shutdown, Toobin makes clear that Cruz is one of those \u201cardent conservatives\u201d opposed to even \u201crudimentary operations of government,\u201d a \u201csmall group of terrorists\u201d dedicated to inducing anarchy, as one Democrat put it.\n\nThis familiar narrative has been not ineffective. Even colleagues in his own cloakroom have partaken (cf. John McCain\u2019s \u201cwacko bird\u201d). But Toobin hopes that Cruz\u2019s \u201cabsolutism\u201d is self-evident, an obvious fact about these new Sarah Palin\u2013inspired Republicans. Enlarge the frame, however, and the narrative is different.\n\nOver at Commentary, Peter Wehner identifies a different \u201cabsolutist\u201d: not the junior senator from Texas, but the current occupant of the White House. President Obama, says Wehner, is afflicted with an acute case of \u201ccognitive inflexibility\u201d: \u201cMr. Obama\u2019s mind is too inflexible, his ideology too gripping, and his vanity too overwhelming to rethink his assumptions and approach.\u201d The consequences are obvious: President Obama\u2019s unwillingness to entertain any perspective on foreign policy other than an enlightened cosmopolitanism ensured that he misunderstood Vladimir Putin and misread the so-called Arab Spring, and his unyielding dedication to withdrawing every blessed troop from the Middle East encouraged anti-American forces, such as ISIS, to hunker down and wait. We are now reaping the rewards. When it comes to the arguments of ideological opponents, he does not even grant them a shadow of legitimacy: Skeptics of man-made climate change are like members of \u201cthe flat-Earth Society\u201d or those who believe in a cheddar moon; opponents of a ballooning debt are \u201chostage takers\u201d; supporters of voter-identification provisions are \u201cun-American.\u201d Simply put, his opponents are, as he told a Seattle fundraiser, an \u201cimpediment.\u201d The president is, by contrast, \u201cnot a particularly ideological person.\u201d He is only \u201cpragmatic.\u201d\n\nTed Cruz does not use this kind of language \u2014 and it would make little difference if he did: The Senate floor regularly steams with hot air. Nor is he interested only in partisan measures: The first bill he authored, to ban an Iranian diplomat who had been involved in the 1979 Tehran hostage-taking from serving as an envoy to the United Nations, passed both the House and the Senate unanimously and was signed into law by President Obama. But even if Ted Cruz were a bomb-throwing, ransom-note-scribbling Bircher speaking in tongues in the Capitol rotunda, there would remain a crucial difference between the firebrand rhetoric of a junior senator in an out-of-power party and the unyielding self-certainty, regardless of facts or circumstances, of a sitting president. The job of one is speechifying; the job of the other is governing.\n\nTed Cruz may be \u201cdoctrinaire,\u201d to use Toobin\u2019s pejorative, but it is President Obama\u2019s refusal to incorporate into his thinking and governing the concerns of his political opponents that has pushed Left and Right farther apart. Moreover, that refusal, seen alongside the usurpation of government resources for partisan purposes (e.g., the IRS scandal), has ensured that many conservatives believe themselves not merely ignored by government, but targeted by it. No longer are conservatives the \u201cprincipled opposition\u201d to the administration; they are its enemies.\n\nThe ascendancy of Ted Cruz must be evaluated against that background.
