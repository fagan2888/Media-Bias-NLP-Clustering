Alameda) on December 5, from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. to see a judge, on a walk-in basis.\n\nIndividuals can check the Court\u2019s website to see if they have a warrant. Under \u201cOnline Resources\u201d select the heading \u201cSee If You Have a Warrant\u201d and follow the prompts. A case number or list of cases with the defendant\u2019s name and case status will appear. If the case is in warrant status that will be indicated in the case status displayed.\n\nThe Court is asking individuals who have outstanding warrants and who are planning to come to the Court on Dec. 5, to address their warrant(s) to notify the Court in advance by email using the link 'Contact Us' on the website or by emailing courtweb@tucsonaz.gov. Notifying the Court in advance will allow for the proper files to be pulled and documents to be prepared in advance. This should allow the Court to see more defendants.\n\nThere will be no consequences if a defendant fails to show up on Warrant Day after sending an email indicating they would attend. The Court\u2019s goal is to have cases prepared in advance to serve as many defendants as possible.\n\nCopyright 2015 Tucson News Now.
