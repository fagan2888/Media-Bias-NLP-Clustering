Thursday afternoon, taking in the Cuba thaw after weeks buoyed by President Barack Obama\u2019s immigration reform executive actions, Labor Secretary Tom Perez put down a new marker for his own boss.\n\n\u201cWhen I reflect on the breadth and depth of what he has done for Latinos, it really makes him in my mind, and in the minds of so many others, the first Latino president,\u201d said Perez, the son of Dominican immigrants and one of the administration\u2019s highest-ranking Latinos.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nPerez isn\u2019t alone in that assessment. But many Latinos aren\u2019t ready to go that far. But they\u2019re starting to move. Obama\u2019s approval rating shot up among Latinos since the executive action announcement, and the change in Cuba policy is a reminder of just how much politics have shifted: Most older Cubans rage against lifting the embargo, while most younger Cubans track with the American public in supporting what Obama did \u2014 not to mention that Cubans now make up only 3.5 percent of the country\u2019s Hispanic population. But polls show non-Cuban Hispanics support normalizing relations with Cuba by far greater margins.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: Obama libre)\n\nObama has already increased his Latino support from 67 percent in 2008 to 71 percent in 2012. If things keep up this way, pollsters see the chance that one of his electoral legacies could be helping deliver upward of 80 percent of a quickly growing population to the next Democratic nominee.\n\nGary Segura, the principal and co-founder of the polling firm Latino Decisions, said Republicans risk hastening that along if they spend the next two years railing against the immigration executive actions \u2014 which, he said, will only help Obama\u2019s standing among Latinos by giving him a chance to repeatedly remind them that he stood with them.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019ll spend most of the last two years of his presidency defending Latinos and his executive action. He\u2019ll look good, his party will look good, the opposition party will look bad,\u201d Segura said.\n\nRep. Mario Diaz-Balart (R-Fla.) is a leader of immigration reform efforts among House Republicans. But as a Cuban himself, and one who represents many other Cubans in South Florida, he said Obama\u2019s outreach to Castro demonstrates \u201ca limitless willingness to appease enemies of freedom,\u201d and a \u201cgrotesque concession.\u201d\n\nObama as the first Latino president? Diaz-Balart said no way. The congressman said Obama\u2019s Cuba shift will hurt him among Latinos, who will reject his backtracking on promises not to change the Cuba relationship without guarantees of human rights or freedom of labor unions and political parties.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: Obama's December surprise)\n\n\u201cThere will be a first Latino president, and one of the things that Latinos want \u2014 it\u2019s an American thing, but a Latino thing \u2014 is you keep your word,\u201d Diaz-Balart said. \u201cIf George Washington was the president who could not tell a lie, then history will record Obama as the president who could not say the truth.\u201d\n\nObama\u2019s relationship with the Latino community has been among the more painful and awkward of his presidency. Like many minority groups, Latinos overwhelmingly attached deep hopes to him coming into office, then spent large parts of the past six years feeling that they were constantly fighting to extract any help or attention from the president.\n\nMany Latinos leaders felt Obama moved on immigration reform last month only because they\u2019d finally boxed him into a corner, much as they attributed the president\u2019s June 2012 executive actions to protect DREAMers to the well-telegraphed plans to have young undocumented Latinos stage civil disobedience protests at Obama reelection campaign rallies. They\u2019re happy about what he finally did \u2014 shielding 5 million people from deportation is the largest single unilateral move any president\u2019s ever taken \u2014 but they haven\u2019t forgotten the 2.1 million Latino-heavy deportations over his six years in office.\n\n\u201cThose wounds don\u2019t magically disappear,\u201d Segura said.\n\nIn the White House and throughout the administration, they point to a bigger story: Obamacare, minimum wage, the emphasis on early childhood education and college affordability already disproportionately affect Latinos. The Latino unemployment rate and high school dropout rate have both dropped by half since the president took office.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: The Democrats' risky Cuba bet)\n\n\u201cThe frustrations with the broken immigration system are real,\u201d said a senior White House aide. \u201cIt\u2019s one element of the administration\u2019s record, and it\u2019s one element of the relationship with the Latino community, but in both cases, it\u2019s one of many elements in a relationship.\u201d\n\nFirst Latino president \u2014 they\u2019re not ready to say it at the White House.\n\nBut the suggestion generates encouraging chuckles more than outright rejection.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s pretty clear who the president is, and it\u2019s also very clear that this will be one of the most consequential for the Latino community,\u201d the White House aide said.\n\nThere was a lot of ground to make up.\n\nA September Wall Street Journal/NBC poll, ahead of the midterms, showed a 14-percentage-point increase in the number of Latinos saying the country was on the wrong track. Since the previous spring, Obama\u2019s job approval among Latinos dropped from 62 percent to 47 percent.\n\nBut in a poll out Thursday, his approval rating was already up 10 points.\n\n\u201c2016 is going to be a great year for Democrats for many reasons, and at the top of that list is Hispanic voters know that Democrats have their backs \u2014 including recent action President Obama took to fix our broken immigration system while House Republicans continue to attack DREAMers and play politics instead of allowing us to vote on a bipartisan, comprehensive solution,\u201d said Rep. Ben Ray Luj\u00e1n (D-N.M.), the new chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.\n\nSegura and other pollsters say the president\u2019s Latino support likely hasn\u2019t hit the ceiling, though that\u2019ll be driven more by the deportation changes than getting an embassy open in Havana.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: GOP livid over Cuba)\n\nTop people in the White House and throughout the administration say Obama\u2019s path forward with Latinos will look a lot like his path forward domestically overall: keeping up the focus on the economy, pushing for new areas of opportunity and growth. They\u2019re still talking about trying again on immigration reform in Congress, though few of them believe there\u2019s much of a chance.\n\nWhile Diaz-Balart said he\u2019ll keep trying, he noted that the Cuba move \u2014 on top of the executive actions \u2014 makes him less willing to work with the White House to get a bill done.\n\n\u201cIf you had presidential leadership and you had a president who kept his word, who you could talk to, it\u2019s still very difficult to do immigration reform. But when you have a president who consistently misleads,\u201d he said, \u201cit makes it more difficult.\u201d\n\nIn the meantime, incoming Congressional Hispanic Caucus Chairwoman Rep. Linda S\u00e1nchez (D-Calif.) said she hopes the White House will build on what she agrees is one of the stronger moments for Obama\u2019s relationship with the Latino community by making sure that the CHC and other Latino groups have a major role on issues far beyond immigration reform, from income inequality to voting rights.\n\nPerez called the Cuba announcement one of the 10 most important days of the Obama presidency. He urged Republicans on the Hill not to let that or resistance to the immigration reform executive actions get the better of them.\n\nThose who do, Perez said, are \u201cfollowing the tradition of [then-California Gov.] Pete Wilson in the \u201990s, who felt that his path to the White House was trying to make it harder for Latinos to get access to opportunity.\u201d\n\n( Also on POLITICO: How Obama and Castro came together)\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s wrong policy, and that ended up transforming the State of California in getting Latinos to vote overwhelmingly Democratic,\u201d Perez said, predicting that the pattern would repeat itself writ large for the entire country.\n\n\u201cThe president gets it,\u201d Perez said.\n\nAnd the White House is trying to get more and more Latinos to see Obama as more than the \u201cdeporter in chief,\u201d as National Council of La Raza president Janet Murgu\u00eda called him this spring, or the \u201cappeaser in chief,\u201d as Diaz-Balart called him in response to the Cuba news.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s something that we work at,\u201d the White House aide said.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "Obama\u2019s not there yet.", "title": "The first Latino president?", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2014/12/the-first-latino-president-113694.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2014/12/18/141218_barack_obama_latino_1_gty.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Barack Obama,Immigration Reform,Cuba,Democrats,Tom Perez,Mario Diaz-Balart,Raul Castro,Immigration,White House,Latinos", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "Obama\u2019s not there yet.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2a82\"", "article_summary": "( Also on POLITICO: Obama's December surprise)\u201cThere will be a first Latino president, and one of the things that Latinos want \u2014 it\u2019s an American thing, but a Latino thing \u2014 is you keep your word,\u201d Diaz-Balart said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s one element of the administration\u2019s record, and it\u2019s one element of the relationship with the Latino community, but in both cases, it\u2019s one of many elements in a relationship.\u201dFirst Latino president \u2014 they\u2019re not ready to say it at the White House.\nThe Latino unemployment rate and high school dropout rate have both dropped by half since the president took office.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s pretty clear who the president is, and it\u2019s also very clear that this will be one of the most consequential for the Latino community,\u201d the White House aide said.\n\u201cIf George Washington was the president who could not tell a lie, then history will record Obama as the president who could not say the truth.\u201dObama\u2019s relationship with the Latino community has been among the more painful and awkward of his presidency."}
