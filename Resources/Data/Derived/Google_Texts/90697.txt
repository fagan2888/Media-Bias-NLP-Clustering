ELLSWORTH, Maine â€” A Mount Desert man accused of stealing jewelry with an estimated total value of more than $100,000 was one of nine people indicted this week by a Hancock County grand jury.

Stafford K. Venema, 22, was arrested last month after he allegedly stole the jewelry from a home in Ellsworth over a period of several weeks, Ellsworth police said.

According to statements made to police by the victim, the total estimated value of the stolen items is $116,350, Ellsworth police Chief John DeLeo said. Police have not been provided with copies of any appraisals of the jewelry, he added.

Venema was indicted Feb. 6 on a class B felony theft charge, which carries a maximum possible sentence of 10 years in prison and a $20,000 fine, and a misdemeanor charge of violating conditions of release.

Eight pieces of jewelry and some silverware are among the items Venema is suspected of taking from the home, DeLeo has said. Some items have been recovered, but it is likely that some never will be, he said.

Also indicted on Feb. 6 were:

Lillian J. Brecht, 33, Hampden, failure to appear in court.

Jason M. Colcord, 36, Ellsworth, failure to comply with sex offender registration.

Isreal D. Hall, 34, Southwest Harbor, operating a motor vehicle after habitual offender conviction.
