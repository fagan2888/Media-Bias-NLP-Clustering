In an op-ed published Thursday in The Washington Post, Sheila Foster Anthony railed against Trump for suggesting that her brother's death was not a suicide, but rather a murder, and for saying that Hillary Clinton may have been involved in said murder because Foster \"knew everything that was going on.\"\n\nShe then set the record straight in what marks the first time she's publicly spoken out about the tragedy:\n\nThis is scurrilous enough coming from right-wing political operatives who have peddled conspiracy theories about Vince's death for more than two decades. How could this be coming from the presumptive Republican nominee for president? Five investigations, including by independent counsels Robert B. Fiske Jr. and Kenneth Starr, concluded that Vince suffered from severe depression that caused him to be unable to sleep, unable to work, unable to think straight, and finally to take his own life. I know this to be true. [Sheila Foster Anthony, via The Washington Post]\n\nAnthony wrote that while she \"did not see a suicide coming,\" when she heard that her brother had died she \"knew\" that he'd committed suicide. \"Never for a minute have I doubted that was what happened,\" she wrote. Because of that certainty, she said, she cannot let \"such craven behavior\" as Trump's \"pass without a response.\"\n\nRead the entirety of her response over at The Washington Post.
