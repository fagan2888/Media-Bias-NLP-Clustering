He feels both U.S. Representatives and Senators should be limited to 12 years in office.\n\nRobertson also announced that he, with personal funds, will match dollar-for-dollar all campaign contributions from individual donors through the March Primary Election. During his announcement, Robertson said he is doing this show that he is not beholden to \u201cspecial interests\u201d.\n\nKFYO\u2019s Rob Snyder interviewed Robertson after his Monday announcement.
