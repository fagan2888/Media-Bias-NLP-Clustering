Chris Christie promised to work towards entitlement reform should he become president.\n\n\u201cFolks will tell you in politics, \u2018don\u2019t talk about that subject,\u2019\u201d Christie said at the event in New Hampshire. \u201cThey call it the third rail of American politics. They say, \u2018don\u2019t touch it.\u2019 So we\u2019re not going to touch it, we\u2019re going to hug it.\u201d\n\nHe said that Americans need to have an \u201chonest conversation\u201d about entitlements.\n\n\u201cSeventy-one percent of the federal budget this year is being spent on entitlement programs,\u201d Christie said.\n\nHe said that anyone who avoids the subject because it is \u201ctoo hard\u201d isn\u2019t fit for national office.\n\nChristie suggested preserving Social Security benefits by increasing the retirement age by two years, but phasing that plan in over 25 years. He argued that a gradual change begins to address the problem, while giving future retirees ample time to plan ahead.\n\nThose who make $200,000 annually in retirement income would be ineligible to receive benefits.\n\nSocial Security, he said, is \u201cinsurance\u201d to prevent seniors from living in poverty.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want any of our seniors to have to choose between heating their home and going to the doctor, between buying food and paying rent,\u201d Christie said. \u201cThey\u2019ve worked hard, and paid into that system throughout their entire lives. We want it to be there for them. But we need to make changes to make sure it\u2019s there.\u201d\n\nChristie also said that the tax code needs to be reformed. He argued the 35 percent corporate tax rate damages America\u2019s ability to compete in a global market, and should be reduced.\n\nIn addition, Christie criticized President Obama\u2019s foreign policy.\n\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t have a defense that deters our adversaries, they will continue to take advantage of us,\u201d Christie said.\n\nChristie also rebuked his potential GOP rival for president, Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., for leading an effort to weaken the Patriot Act.\n\nChristie said he used the Patriot Act to prosecute terrorists during his time as U.S. attorney for New Jersey.\n\nHe claims that the program merely collects phone numbers, and that any other information must be obtained with a warrant.\n\n\u201cNow if you listen to Sen. Paul and Sen. [Mike] Lee and these other guys down in Washington talk about this, you would think I\u2019m listening to the calls with your mother.\u201d Christie said. \u201cAnd that we\u2019ve got operators at the NSA [National Security Agency] sitting there every day listening to your phone calls. We don\u2019t. We don\u2019t. But yet they\u2019re taking this tool away.\u201d\n\nHe said the congressional decision to reform the Patriot Act makes the country weaker.\n\nChristie spent over an hour answering questions from the audience, but lightly evaded questions on student loan debt, promising to address his education policy in a speech later this week.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m giving the speech on Thursday,\u201d he joked. \u201cNo one is going to come.\u201d\n\nThe New Jersey Republican has yet to declare his intentions for 2016, but is spending a great deal of time in the Granite State, home to the first presidential primary.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Speaking at a town hall meeting tonight, New Jersey Gov.
