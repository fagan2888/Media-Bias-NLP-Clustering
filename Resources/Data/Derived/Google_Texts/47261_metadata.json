The state program was the first of its kind in the nation.\n\nHorizon Blue Cross Blue Shield of New Jersey was the only insurance carrier that agreed to offer the FamilyCare Advantage plan, which covered most medical, dental and vision needs for the relative bargain of $144 a month per child.\n\nBut it didn\u2019t offer mental health treatment and several other services Obamacare requires, and that was the fatal flaw, said Sen. Joseph Vitale (D-Middlesex), who sponsored the law creating the program.\n\nVitale said he tried for several months to broker a deal between Horizon and the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, but neither side could agree on how to make it affordable and legal. The program ended last week.\n\nPeople who tried to buy a plan on the health exchange would have been hit with sticker shock, Vitale said. FamilyCare Advantage had no deductible, compared with the less generous Horizon plan on the exchange that has a minimum deductible of $1,500. And most people would not have qualified for subsidies through the exchange because they earned too much money, he said.\n\n\u201cThis is enormously disappointing. New Jersey was always ahead of the nation on health coverage for children and parents,\u201d said Vitale. \u201cIt was $5 for doctor visits, $1 for pharmacy and no deductible or cost sharing.\u201d\n\nVitale noted the irony that the program created to extend universal health care access to all New Jersey\u2019s uninsured children was done in by federal health care reform.\n\nFamilyCare Advantage \u201cwas a great deal,\u201d but with little marketing it never caught on, Vitale said. \u201cIt\u2019s New Jersey\u2019s best-kept secret.\u201d\n\nSurprised\n\nBob Miotla of Gloucester Township, who signed up his son, Robert, for the coverage after his wife\u2019s company stopped offering family coverage about four years ago, said the letter from Horizon in January \u201ctook us by surprise.\u201d\n\n\u201cWithout having that safety net, if an illness arises, we will probably take him to the ER,\u201d said Miotla, who is disabled and gets Medicare.\n\nThe news made him \u201cextremely angry\u201d with both the federal government and Horizon, Miotla said.\n\n\u201cObamacare did snuff it out, but it also looks like Horizon was looking for a reason to end it. With all of the federal mandates (for employers to offer insurance) delayed, they didn\u2019t need to do anything right now.\u201d\n\nThis is not the only instance of the Affordable Care Act clashing with existing health policies.\n\nAbout 800,000 people who bought their coverage through the state-regulated small-employer and individual market programs were informed last fall their plans did not contain all of what the federal law requires: hospitalization, lab services, rehab services and devices, outpatient services, emergency care, prescription drugs, maternity care, preventive services, mental health and substance abuse treatment, and pediatric services, including oral and vision care. Insurance policies also could no longer contain lifetime caps on benefits.\n\nAs millions across the nation started losing their coverage for the same reason, President Obama asked governors and state insurance commissioners to preserve these policies for a year.\n\nGov. Chris Christie let the insurance companies decide, and they declined, saying the federal government still required no lifetime cap on benefits, which would make the policies much more expensive.\n\nThe same reckoning played out with the FamilyCare Advantage plan.\n\n\u201cThe NJ FamilyCare Advantage plan does not meet all ACA requirements and would have had to be significantly changed. This would have increased considerably the premiums for the plan,\u201d Horizon spokesman Tom Vincz said.\n\nDisagreeing\n\nDanielle Liss, spokeswoman for the federal Medicaid program, disagreed with Horizon\u2019s assessment. \u201cHorizon had the option to extend any non-ACA compliant plans for another year even without changing benefits to meet the ACA requirements said,\u201d she said.\n\nVitale said that in the end, the Obama administration would not allow the Advantage plan to be offered to just the original customers without it being an option for everyone.\n\n\u201cNow people will have to go on the exchange, where the premiums are reasonable but the deductibles are enormous,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Affordable Care Act is costing families a lot more than it should.\u201d\n\nRELATED COVERAGE\n\n\u2022 N.J. residents without health insurance declined in '08\n\n\u2022 Chris Christie will let insurance companies decide whether to extend 800,000 policies\n\nMore Politics", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "chris-christie, gloucester-township, health-news, obamacare, news", "title": "Obamacare eclipses low-cost NJ health plan for middle-class kids", "og": {"site_name": "NJ.com", "description": "Due to Obamacare requirements, the state-created FamilyCare Advantage health plan for kids was canceled March 31.", "title": "Obamacare eclipses low-cost NJ health plan for middle-class kids", "url": "http://www.nj.com/politics/index.ssf/2014/04/obamacare_eclipses_low-cost_nj_health_plan_for_middle-class_kids.html", "image": "http://image.nj.com/home/njo-media/width620/img/politics_impact/photo/14634457-standard.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Due to Obamacare requirements, the state-created FamilyCare Advantage health plan for kids was canceled March 31.", "creator": "@susanklivio", "image": "http://image.nj.com/home/njo-media/width620/img/politics_impact/photo/14634457-standard.jpg", "title": "Obamacare eclipses low-cost NJ health plan for middle-class kids", "site": "@njdotcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article_date_updated": "Sunday, April 06, 2014,  7:34 AM", "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "NJ.com", "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Sunday, April 06, 2014,  7:30 AM", "article_author": "Susan K.
