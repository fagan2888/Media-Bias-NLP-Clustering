Douville at Douville, Goldman and Allen said the U.S. Congress passed a bill of tax act changes last December called \u201cProtecting Americans from Tax Hikes.\u201d\n\nHe noted several provisions that affect individuals; and some of them were made \u201cpermanent\u201d after repeatedly expiring and then being renewed one year at a time.\n\nIf a taxpayer owes no health insurance penalties for not having coverage, filing a tax return for 2015 income is easier. If the taxpayer has health insurance and can check that box for everyone on the tax return, that\u2019s also easier.\n\n\u201cThe penalties are increased this year and may surprise some people,\u201d Douville said.\n\nLast December\u2019s legislation made permanent the $1,000 refundable tax credit per child.\n\nThe American Opportunity Tax Credit was made permanent, $2,500 per year for four years for qualified education expenses. For this tax credit, the employee identification number of the educational institution is required. This requirement is new.\n\nThe \u201cabove the line deduction\u201d up to $4,000 for qualified tuition and related expenses was extended for 2015 and 2016 taxes.\n\nDouville said the form 1098-T usually provided by one\u2019s school has amounts in Box 1 and Box 2 for 2016 and beyond; and the dollar amount shown paid in Box 2 will qualify for taxes.\n\nThe earned income tax credit was made permanent.\n\nThe \u201cabove the line\u201d deduction of $250 for educators is now permanent and starting in 2016 it will be indexed for inflation.\n\nThe itemized deduction for sale tax was made permanent. Douville said people have thought that was always there, but it\u2019s available only for those who itemize for their tax return.\n\nThe direct transfer of up to $1,000 from an IRA to a charitable organization was made permanent.\n\nThe itemized deduction for mortgage insurance premiums was extended through 2016.\n\nThe credit for \u201cnonbusiness energy property\u201d such as weather-tight windows and doors was extended through 2016.\n\nThe new law allows a rollover from a 401K to a \u201csimple IRA\u201d plan. Douville said it previously only could be rolled to an IRA; the rules for the two kinds are different.\n\nFor businesses, Douville said last December\u2019s legislation says the Section 179 expense deduction was made permanent on certain equipment up to $500,000.\n\n\u201cThis deduction will be indexed for inflation now,\u201d Douville said.\n\nAlso for businesses, the Bonus Depreciation Deduction was extended for new equipment through 2019.\n\n\u201cMost of these deductions expired in 2014 or before; and this act makes most of them permanent or extended them to 2016 or \u201919,\u201d Douville said.\n\nGenerally, Douville said the recent legislation requires the IRS Commissioner to have his employees answerable to taxpayers to get quality service; to be heard; to appeal and to have representation.\n\nDouville said those who can file a simple tax return can do it online directly with the IRS, or with some companies such as TurboTax.\n\nHe said using a phone to call the IRS with questions always leads to at least a 30-minute wait, or to a recorded message saying the person should call back at another time or on another day.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t have enough people, period,\u201d Douville said.\n\nThis CPA firm is at 313 Earl Garrett, and can be contacted at 257-3112.\n\nH&R Block\n\nJoe Reeh at H&R Block in Kerrville also noted the child tax credit is now permanent, saying this credit applies as long as the child or children are under age 17.\n\n\u201cAnd the American Opportunity Credit that is now permanent is for college or university students. A lot of people miss this one,\u201d Reeh said.\n\n\u201cThe Enhanced Earned Income Credit was made permanent with a higher credit for families of three or more children, with a maximum of $6,242. That\u2019s based on the taxpayer\u2019s income, for example, $53,000 for a married couple,\u201d Reeh said.\n\nHe said the deduction for state and local sales taxes applies also if a taxpayer purchases a vehicle, boat or recreational vehicle or trailer, and this one only applies in states with no state income tax. He said this deduction averages $1,200 per taxpayer.\n\nReeh had several comments about Obamacare.\n\nUnder \u201cIndividual Shared Responsibility\u201d penalties, the rules say beginning Jan. 1, 2014, individuals who do not meet certain exemption criteria must have \u201cMinimum Essential Health Coverage.\u201d For every month that a nonexempt individual or that person\u2019s nonexempt dependents do not have MEC, a penalty is imposed.\n\nThe amount of any payment owed depends on the number of months in a given year an individual is without coverage or an exemption.\n\nReeh said some people are not subject to the penalties. They include:\n\n\u2022 The individual cannot afford coverage \u2013 literally don\u2019t have enough income to afford any of the plans even with a subsidy;\n\n\u2022 The individual\u2019s household income is below the tax filing threshold, figured on the federal poverty line chart for taxes figured in 2015;\n\n\u2022 The individual is a member of a Native American Indian tribe;\n\n\u2022 The individual has a \u201cshort coverage gap,\u201d for example 10 months covered with health insurance and two months not covered.\n\nReeh said the exemption for unaffordable health coverage is claimed in Part III of Form 8965 filed with an individual\u2019s tax return.\n\nReeh said the biggest exemption he uses for these taxpayers is when one is exempt from the penalty because their reportable household income is below the threshold to file a return.\n\nThe IRS has pages of rules about dealing with Obamacare and tax agents attended hours of classes on the subject. Reeh has a chart of \u201cApplicable Dollar Amount\u201d of penalties by year, for those 18 years of age or older and for those under 18.\n\nIn 2014, that penalty was $95 per adult without health coverage and $47.50 per child.\n\nThat penalty has risen for taxes filed in 2016 to $695 per adult and $347.50 per child. There\u2019s a government formula for it that rose from 1 percent for 2013 or \u201914, to 2 percent on 2015 income. That penalty will rise to 2.5 percent for tax years starting in 2016.\n\nAt one point, Reeh had a stack of tax forms on his desk for clients with no 2015 health care coverage, and their penalties are being deducted from whatever refund they are expecting.\n\n\u201cWe discussed it with them, and the clients are saying they can\u2019t afford monthly premiums for health insurance, for some of them $800 per month or more. They say paying this one-time penalty is cheaper than paying the monthly premiums,\u201d Reeh said.\n\nAt H&R Block, Reeh said about 20 percent of their clients owe penalties because they have no health insurance. That includes working people at small businesses with no company plans, or the self-employed, he said.\n\nHe said everybody, especially people who bought health insurance on the federal Marketplace and do their own taxes, need to wait to get a Form 1095A. It\u2019s usually sent by Jan. 31.\n\n\u201cIf you filed early without that, any refund will be frozen six to eight weeks until the numbers are reconciled,\u201d Reeh said. \u201cRetired folks have insurance through Medicare. There\u2019s a box on the form to mark if they have insurance and Medicare covers that.\u201d\n\nThe Form 1099SSA form tells recipients who get Social Security, and it must be filed with other tax forms.\n\nIf one needs forms, the IRS will tell you to download them from the IRS website.\n\nHe recommends getting \u201cTax Guide for Individuals\u201d online, a useful book of more than 270 pages that used to be available paperbound. Reeh said he now downloads it on his office printer and puts the pages in a three-ring binder. It\u2019s written in \u201cuser-friendly language,\u201d he said.\n\nAnother recent change is how many young people are operating paperless using \u201csmart phones.\u201d It\u2019s possible to file a simple tax return on that phone, but Reeh recommends printing out at least one copy and keeping it for five years.\n\n\u201cI had one young man here talking about medical expenses, and I asked for his bank statement. He told me he banked online and it was a lot of work to print it out. I told him to print out his checks anyway. We needed them to figure his medical expenses,\u201d Reeh said.\n\nH&R Block has offices at 830 Sidney Baker N.; and at 3112 Junction Hwy., Ingram. Hours at both are 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. Monday through Friday and 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Saturday.\n\nLiberty Tax Service\n\nDeena Elliott, general manager at Liberty, said their preparers are dealing with several issues, including fallout from ID theft. She said if a person has been affected, they should get a federal IRS number to prove their identity, and bring it with them to the tax office.\n\nObamacare is an ongoing issue.\n\n\u201cPeople don\u2019t realize how much money it is. It\u2019s usually not a flat rate but a percent of income \u2013 1 percent of adjusted income in 2014 and 2 percent on 2015 income,\u201d she said.\n\nAnd people who got health care credit last year have to do a new tax form and reconcile that using Form 1095A.\n\n\u201cI think people underestimated its impact. Some are paying $1,000-1,500,\u201d Elliott said. \u201cSome clients say they can\u2019t afford health insurance. The deductible is too high, and the penalty is still cheaper.\u201d\n\nThe penalty may seem small for children, but a household has to account for everyone\u2019s income, including Mom\u2019s Social Security, she said.\n\nShe also said the federal government placed explanations and enforcement on tax preparers\u2019 shoulders.\n\nShe advised people to visit and ask about exemptions because there are about 18 of them. People who are doing their own taxes are missing a lot of them.\n\nShe said people who are doing their own returns are missing a lot of credits.\n\nElliott also said they\u2019ve gotten troubling calls from clients who report scam calls from people claiming to be IRS who threaten them with arrest if they don\u2019t immediately pay XX amount of back taxes. That\u2019s a scam, she said.\n\n\u201cPlease call us. If you can get caller ID, tell us; we\u2019ll turn that in. The big tip-off is if they ask for your Social Security number after they claim to be from the IRS. Why would they have to do that? Don\u2019t give them income information or anything personal,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople have told us the caller raises his or her voice if the person they call asks them too many questions.\u201d\n\nShe noted education credits are still available and can be substantial for people in the first two years of secondary education. She also advises taxpayers check their retirement and savings fund records through work accounts, especially the larger employers.\n\nLiberty offers \u201cAppreciation Weeks\u201d in which the first tax return prepared there for qualified people is free. The week of Feb. 21-27 is for teachers, coaches and school administrators; and Liberty continues with other groups through March 20-27.\n\nOffice location and hours are 409 Main St. in Kerrville, with hours 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. Monday through Friday; 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Saturday; and other times by appointment.
