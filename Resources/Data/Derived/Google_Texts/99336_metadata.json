But then in its on-screen chyron, the network sought to attribute the increases not to the litigants involved in the case, but to President Obama, potentially confusing viewers.\n\n\u201cCould legal challenges to taxpayer subsidies put Obamacare in a death spiral?\u201d Fox host Bill Hemmer asked, pointing to \u201ca new study funded by the Department of Health and Human Services saying the health care law may be damaged beyond repair if you take the subsidies away, if they\u2019re eliminated.\u201d\n\nOngoing lawsuits are challenging the legality of providing subsidies through health insurance marketplaces in states that refused to set up their own exchanges. If those legal challenges succeed, the analysis that Hemmer is referencing \u2014 which comes from the RAND Corporation \u2014 did in fact conclude that premiums in those states could increase by as much as 43.3 percent. RAND\u2019s researchers found that if federal subsidies to federally-run exchanges are ruled to be illegal, millions of people would have to pay more for coverage and could leave the risk pool, leading to a death spiral in which only the sickest people remain insured. Enrollment would fall by 68 percent and 11.3 million Americans could become uninsured.\n\nHemmer and Fox contributor Byron York huffed and puffed about the dangers of such a ruling, calling it \u201ccolossal\u201d \u2014 despite the fact that the suits have been filed by conservatives, are supported by Republican lawmakers, and have been reported on favorably by the network in the past. The National Review has called the lawsuits and \u201cingenious\u201d way to halt Obamacare. Fox, celebrated the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals\u2019 ruling against the administration on July 22 by pronouncing, \u201cone by one they\u2019re getting chipped away so it\u2019s starting to collapse.\u201d\n\nAnd although the price increases are a direct result of a negative ruling, Fox News ran the story under the chyron \u201csticker shock again for some Obamacare enrollees as premiums set to rise,\u201d implying that the law\u2019s backers would be responsible.\n\nSo far, an appellate court in Virginia has ruled that the subsidies were legal, but a three-judge panel on the D.C. circuit disagreed. The full D.C. court is expected to reverse that decision, however, eliminating the circuit split and reducing the possibility that the Supreme Court will take up the matter. Another ruling against the law is still working its way through the legal system.\n\nThe administration contends that even though the law does not explicitly state that federally-run exchanges are to offer subsidies for coverage, the intent of its framers \u2014 as well as its other provisions about achieving \u201cnear-universal coverage\u201d and financial security from medical bankruptcy \u2014 strongly imply that such credits must be made available.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "About what you'd expect from the network.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "About what you'd expect from the network.", "title": "Fox News Admits GOP Is Trying To Increase Obamacare Premiums, Then Tries To Cover It Up", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/health/2014/10/21/3582351/fox-news-obamacare-admission/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/fox_news_tpftd-e1375713561184.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "About what you'd expect from the network.", "creator": "@@igorvolsky", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/fox_news_tpftd-321x214.jpg", "title": "Fox News Admits GOP Is Trying To Increase Obamacare Premiums, Then Tries To Cover It Up", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-health", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/fox_news_tpftd-e1375713561184.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/fox_news_tpftd-e1375713561184.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2014-10-21T11:39:51+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/ivolsky"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb495\"", "article_summary": "Health Fox News Admits GOP Is Trying To Increase Obamacare Premiums, Then Tries To Cover It Up CREDIT:Fox News admitted on Tuesday that a conservative-led lawsuit against the Affordable Care Act would raise health care premiums for millions of Americans.\nSo far, an appellate court in Virginia has ruled that the subsidies were legal, but a three-judge panel on the D.C. circuit disagreed.\nAnother ruling against the law is still working its way through the legal system.\nThe National Review has called the lawsuits and \u201cingenious\u201d way to halt Obamacare.\nIf those legal challenges succeed, the analysis that Hemmer is referencing \u2014 which comes from the RAND Corporation \u2014 did in fact conclude that premiums in those states could increase by as much as 43.3 percent."}
