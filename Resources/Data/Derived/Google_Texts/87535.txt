University of Kansas law students helped a woman win an appeal of her conviction in the murder of a Topeka homeless advocate.

The university's law school's Project for Innocence and Post-Conviction Remedies filed the appeal on Kimberly Sharp's behalf and presented oral arguments in the case in March before the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Denver.

The Lawrence Journal-World reports he appeals panel ruled earlier this month that Sharp was unconstitutionally convicted in the 2006 slaying of 38-year-old David Owen.

Jean Phillips, Project for Innocence director and Kansas law clinical professor, says it's very difficult to win such an appeal.

The unanimous decision from the appeals panel sends Sharp's case back to Shawnee County District Court for a second trial.
