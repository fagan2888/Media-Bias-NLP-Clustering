HELENA — Assurant Health plans to notify its Montana customers that it will stop selling and renewing health insurance coverage at the end of the year.

The Milwaukee, Wisconsin-based company has struggled financially and is exiting the national insurance market.

Assurant covers 7,283 people in Montana, most through affiliated companies Time and John Alden. Last year, it became the fourth insurer to offer Montana health plans on the federal online exchange.

State insurance commissioner spokeswoman Jennifer McKee said Friday Montanans covered by Assurant will receive letters beginning next week that their individual health plans won’t be renewed after Dec. 31.

Individuals will have to find new plans during the 2016 open enrollment period that begins Nov. 1.

Group policies with renewal dates that extend past Dec. 31 will be discontinued on those dates.
