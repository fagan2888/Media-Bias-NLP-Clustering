With children at home, parents will have to find child care or stay home from work. \u201cEither way it goes, Clay County has lost. Nobody\u2019s won.\u201d\n\nThanks to Obamacare, 1,150 students in the Volunteer State are without the education they need and deserve, and that taxpayers are paying for. How many other school districts in cash-strapped counties across the country will be forced to close?\n\n__________________________________\n\nKristina Ribali is the Senior Coalitions Director for the Foundation for Government Accountability.
