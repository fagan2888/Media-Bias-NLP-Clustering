But they have different ideas about how to get there that cut to the core of their governing philosophies.\n\nVermont Sen. Sanders promises free health care for all, which some estimates say will add trillions of dollars to the national debt. \u201cI disagree with that study,\u201d Sanders said when confronted with numbers from the debate moderators Thursday night. He said that his \u201cproposal, a Medicare-for-all single payer program, will save middle class families many thousands of dollars a year in their health care costs.\u201d\n\nFormer Secretary of State Clinton said she agrees with Sanders lofty goals, but she advocates a more pragmatic approach. \u201cI absolutely agree with the diagnosis,\u201d she said. \u201cThe diagnosis that we\u2019ve got to do much more to finish the work of getting universal health care coverage, something that I\u2019ve worked on for 25 years\u2026 But I do think when you make proposals and you\u2019re running for president, you should be held accountable for whether or not the numbers add up and whether or not the plans are actually going to work.\u201d\n\nClinton said she wants to continue building on the Affordable Care Act, and that Sanders\u2019 plan \u201cwould pose an incredible burden not just on the budget, but on individuals.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf someone promises you something for free, read the fine print,\u201d Clinton quipped, saying it was a favorite mantra of her late father.\n\nSanders fired back: \u201cSecretary Clinton will have to explain to the people of our country how it could be that every other major country on earth manages to guarantee health care to all of their people, spending significantly less per capita than we can,\u201d he said. \u201cI live 50 miles away from Canada, you know, it\u2019s not some kind of communist authoritarian country.
