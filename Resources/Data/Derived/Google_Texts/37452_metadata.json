Mercy does not want students to feel entitled to pay back loans forever and truly promote the multiple scholarships along with grants and financial aid available to anyone who wants to go there.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a tremendous value that\u2019s hard to beat for higher education,\u201d she said.\n\nNot only is Mercy known for its impeccable and affordable price, but also they are devoted to taking as many credits as they can from a student\u2019s previous college.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re generous with credits from a previous school, so we try to take as much as we can,\u201d Whitman said. According to the Mercy website, a maximum of 75 credits can be accepted upon transfer from an accredited two-year college. Transferring from an accredited four-year college allows a maximum of 90 credits, and combined credits from both two- and four-year colleges cannot exceed 90 credit hours \u2013 a huge benefit for students who spent a lot of time at another school.\n\n\u201cThe partnership with community colleges is very strong,\u201d she added.\n\nAfter all the credits are sorted out and applied to Mercy\u2019s curriculum, Whitman said that their students are encouraged to create a plan to get their degrees on time.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a priority that they graduate and start their lives,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cGraduate courses can apply to undergrad and graduate degrees \u2013 so students can get a master\u2019s degree within only three years,\u201d she said. \u201cIt positions other students ahead in the real world, giving them a competitive edge.\u201d\n\nThe administration and faculty at Mercy College strive to see their students succeed and be the best that they can in a short amount of time. Recently, Whitman said, the college added a new coaching and mentoring program for incoming transfer students \u2013 a program that was once only available to freshmen coming into school for the first time.\n\nThe program allows incoming transfers to be paired up with a personal coach \u2013 someone with a master\u2019s degree, who has his or her own real life experience and who is enthusiastic about student success.\n\nThese mentors meet with their designated student and create customized plans and it is called the Personalized Achievement Contract Program (PACT).\n\nWhitman said that this program is a huge aid to students suffering from culture shock of transferring to a college straight out of community college.\n\n\u201cThe national average of students meeting with an advisor is two times per semester,\u201d she said. \u201cAt Mercy, it\u2019s 20 times a semester.\u201d\n\nThe mentors connect with the students and allow them to become comfortable with their new surroundings and even offer aid in internships and experience.\n\n\u201cThe faculty at Mercy are the most passionate about higher education and their students,\u201d she added.\n\nAlong with the ongoing support students receive from faculty; Whitman said that the location, classes, scheduling and programs are all great for students considering the switch to Mercy.\n\n\u201cWe have 90 academic programs, but what really helps us is our location is phenomenal,\u201d she said. Including the main campus in Dobbs Ferry, Mercy College also has three other campuses: in Manhattan, the Bronx and in Yorktown Heights. All of these campuses have student housing for their students, and if staying at a dorm is not an option, the travel for commuter students is always a breeze.\n\n\u201cThe campuses are very accessible to all forms of public transportation,\u201d Whitman said. \u201cWe make sure that we make everything very streamline for commuter students.\u201d\n\nHowever even with the easy public transportation available, the campuses have open gym facilities that commuters are able to use, cafes and various personal spaces that commuters can lounge in while waiting for class.\n\n\u201cWe really think through what students need, whether residential or transfer,\u201d she added.\n\nTransferring to Mercy College could be a great choice for students, especially if they want to study one of the college\u2019s main five strengths:\n\nMercy is known high for its health and natural sciences programs, business school, social and behavioral sciences degree, education degree and even the study of liberal arts for those who still may not be 100 percent sure where they want to take their learning after they leave community college.\n\nStudents who want to visit Mercy are able to do so anytime and may even sit in on a class if they want to see how comfortable a school with a 17-to-1 student-to-teacher ratio can be; studying at a college with the added bonus of having a wide range of programs and a great price tag.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://cccnews.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/cropped-cropped-campus-news-logo-filbert.jpg"}, "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "viewport": "width=device-width", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://cccnews.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/campus1-54b9dbd6v1_site_icon.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc2ec\"", "article_summary": "Including the main campus in Dobbs Ferry, Mercy College also has three other campuses: in Manhattan, the Bronx and in Yorktown Heights.\nAccording to the Mercy website, a maximum of 75 credits can be accepted upon transfer from an accredited two-year college.\nWhitman said that this program is a huge aid to students suffering from culture shock of transferring to a college straight out of community college.\nBy Julianne MosherCampus NewsDeciding where to go after leaving community college may be the hardest decision students face after graduation.\n\u201cIt positions other students ahead in the real world, giving them a competitive edge.\u201dThe administration and faculty at Mercy College strive to see their students succeed and be the best that they can in a short amount of time."}
