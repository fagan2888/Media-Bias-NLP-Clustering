The Democrats are trying to persuade Republicans to fall for this so that the Democrats get more voters.\u201d\n\nIn fact, polling data shows that immigrants from Latin America tend to support immigration reform in greater numbers than U.S.-born Latinos.\n\nInstead of supporting immigration reform, she urged Republicans to follow the party\u2019s 2012 presidential candidate\u2019s example.\n\n\u201cAs Romney said, we will appeal to Hispanics the way we appeal to everyone -- by saying we\u2019re the party that offers opportunity and freedom from regulation and we won\u2019t pass stupid bills like Obamacare that pay for abortions,\u201d Coulter said, paraphrasing comments from U.S. Senator-elect Cory Gardner (R-Co).\n\nRomney, who pushed the policy of \u201cself-deportation\u201d and pledged to strip deportation relief from those brought here illegally as children, won only 27 percent of the Hispanic vote in 2012. It was the worst performance among Latino voters in a presidential election since Bob Dole\u2019s failed attempt in 1996.\n\nCoulter raged against Latinos after they rejected Romney, implying in a column that those who backed Obama, particularly nonwhites, are \u201cnitwits who deserve lives of misery and joblessness.\u201d She singled out Latin American immigrants in particular, portraying Latinos as a lazy \u201cunderclass\u201d looking for a handout, despite the fact that immigrants use less government benefits than they are entitled to, according to a study by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.\n\nCoulter said the new Republican-controlled Congress should pass bills popular among conservatives that Obama would be likely to veto, in order to showcase the divergence between him and the GOP.\n\n\u201cThe newspapers are going to have to report what Obama just vetoed and people are going to have to say, \u2018Wait a minute, illegal aliens are getting earned income tax benefits?\u2019\u201d Coulter said. \u201cMost people would be shocked to know that\u2019s happening now. Send that one up.\u201d\n\nIn fact, undocumented immigrants do not generally earn tax breaks for themselves, but rather on behalf of their U.S. citizen children. In other ways, undocumented immigrants -- who are generally excluded from government benefits -- subsidize benefits for U.S. citizens.\n\nFor example, undocumented immigrants pay an estimated $13 billion into social security, according to the agency\u2019s chief actuary, while only taking roughly $1 billion back.\n\nShe and the show\u2019s host later praised Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, who had taken a hardline approach of immigration reform. Patrick ran a campaign ad saying the Islamic State group was planning an invasion through the U.S.-Mexico border, an idea that Department of Homeland Security officials have repeatedly said is not supported by any credible evidence.\n\nThey cited Patrick\u2019s performance among Hispanic voters as measured by the national exit poll, at 46 percent -- a high figure for a Republican, given that party\u2019s mediocre performance among Latino voters in recent years.\n\nSome pollsters, however, dispute those results, saying the national exit poll isn\u2019t designed to offer a representative sample of subgroups like Hispanic voters. A poll by Latino Decisions of more than 500 Hispanic voters in Texas over the five days leading into the election found that only 29 percent of respondents backed Patrick.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Conservative pundit Ann Coulter continued to...", "sailthru.expire_date": "2014-11-11 13:43:50 -0500", "og": {"site_name": "The Huffington Post", "description": "Conservative pundit Ann Coulter continued to...", "title": "Ann Coulter Offers Republicans Nonsensical Minority Outreach Advice", "url": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/11/10/ann-coulter-offers-republ_n_6134072.html", "image": "http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2263086/images/o-COUTER-facebook.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Conservative pundit Ann Coulter continued to...", "title": "Ann Coulter Offers Republicans Nonsensical Minority Outreach Advice", "image": {"width": 2000, "identifier": "http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2263086/images/o-COUTER-facebook.jpg", "height": 1000}, "creator": "RoqPlanas", "site": "@LatinoVoices", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-11-10 13:43:50 -0500", "al": {"ios": {"url": "huffpostnews:///?editionID=us&entryID=6134072", "app_store_id": 306621789, "app_name": "The Huffington Post"}}, "taboola.category": "latino-voices", "fb": {"app_id": 46744042133}, "keywords": "Latino politics,hispanic vote,Ann Coulter,ann coulter hispanics,ann coulter latinos,Ann Coulter Hispanic Vote,Ann Coulter Latino Vote,Ann Coulter Immigration,Ann Coulter 'Suck Up'", "article": {"section": "Latino Voices", "tag": "Latino politics,hispanic vote,Ann Coulter,ann coulter hispanics,ann coulter latinos,Ann Coulter Hispanic Vote,Ann Coulter Latino Vote,Ann Coulter Immigration,Ann Coulter 'Suck Up'", "published_time": "2014-11-10 13:43:50 -0500", "modified_time": "2014-11-10 13:59:01 -0500"}, "viewport": "width=1000"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe05f0\"", "article_summary": "Instead of supporting immigration reform, she urged Republicans to follow the party\u2019s 2012 presidential candidate\u2019s example.\nIt was the worst performance among Latino voters in a presidential election since Bob Dole\u2019s failed attempt in 1996.\nIn other ways, undocumented immigrants -- who are generally excluded from government benefits -- subsidize benefits for U.S. citizens.\nSend that one up.\u201dIn fact, undocumented immigrants do not generally earn tax breaks for themselves, but rather on behalf of their U.S. citizen children.\nFor example, undocumented immigrants pay an estimated $13 billion into social security, according to the agency\u2019s chief actuary, while only taking roughly $1 billion back."}
