The House Education and Workforce Committee calls it the Student Success Act. Committee chair –Republican John Kline of Minnesota says it will give parents more school choice and eliminates unnecessary federal programs.

“[HR 5] empowers parents with more school choice options by continuing support for magnet schools and expanding charter school opportunities, as well as allowing Title I funds to follow low-income children to the traditional public or charter school of the parent’s choice.”

The one Ohioan on the House Education committee, is ranking Democrat Marcia Fudge who voted against it.

“It is tragic that students in Cleveland and in poor school districts throughout the nation will suffer as a result of H.R. 5. I believe it is no accident this legislation weakens public education and siphons resources from poor school districts and reallocates them to wealthier school districts. We are failing a generation of young people. Those who voted for it should be ashamed.”

Fudge also said the “action will disproportionally harm many disadvantaged low income students.”

The head of the White House Domestic Policy Council, Cecilia Muñoz agrees.

“Same thing is true for Cleveland which would lose 25.8% of its funding compared to a community like Shaker Hts which would see an increase of 21.6% of its funding. This approach is backward and our teachers and kids deserve much much better.”

That would be a $14.1 million dollar loss for Cleveland. Columbus would lose 25.1% or $11.8 million and Cincinnati would drop $5.1 million. The full House is expected to pass it while the Senate is working on a more bi-partisan version. Munoz would not say whether the President would veto it
