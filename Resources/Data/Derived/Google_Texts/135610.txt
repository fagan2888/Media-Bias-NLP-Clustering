Spearfish, SD

The South Dakota Game, Fish and Parks Commission has rejected a proposal to allow non-residents to join this season's mountain lion hunt and lowered limits on the number of animals allowed to be killed.



The Rapid City Journal reports that the proposal was nixed at the commission's monthly meeting on Friday after considerable discussion and review of more than 150 oral and written public comments.



The season starts Dec. 26 in the Black Hills.



Commission Chairman John Cooper says that for the upcoming season, a total of 60 mountain lions or 40 females could be harvested. The commission set last year's harvest limits at 75 animals or 50 females, whichever occurred first.



Cooper says hunting fees fund extensive research into continued mountain lion management.
