And I hope that the IFKAT \u2014 the institutions formerly known as the troika \u2014 are paying attention.\n\nThe essence of the Greek situation is that the actual parameters of a short-run deal are clear and unavoidable: Greece can\u2019t run a primary budget deficit, because nobody will lend it new money, and it won\u2019t (and basically can\u2019t) run a large primary surplus, because you can\u2019t squeeze even more blood from that stone. So you would think that an agreement for Greece to run a modest primary surplus over the next few years would be easy to reach \u2014 that is what will happen, so why not make it official?\n\nBut now the IMF is playing bad cop, declaring that it cannot release funds until Syriza toes the line on pensions and labor market reform. The latter is dubious economics \u2014 the IMF\u2019s own research doesn\u2019t support enthusiasm about structural reforms, especially in the labor market. The former probably recognizes a real problem \u2014 Greece probably can\u2019t deliver what it has promised pensioners \u2014 but why should this be an issue over and above the general question of the primary surplus.\n\nWhat I would urge everyone to do is ask what happens if Greece is in fact pushed out of the euro. (Yes, Grexit \u2014 ugly word, but we\u2019re stuck with it.)\n\nIt would surely be ugly in Greece, at least at first. Right now the core euro countries believe that the rest of the euro area can handle it, which might be true. Bear in mind, however, that the supposed firewall of ECB support has never actually been tested. If markets lose faith and the time for ECB purchases of Spanish or Italian bonds arises, will it really happen?\n\nBut the bigger question is what happens a year or two after Grexit, where the real risk to the euro is not that Greece will fail but that it will succeed. Suppose that a greatly devalued new drachma brings a flood of British beer-drinkers to the Ionian Sea, and Greece starts to recover. This would greatly encourage challengers to austerity and internal devaluation elsewhere.\n\nThink about it. Just the other day the Very Serious Europeans were hailing Spain as a great success story, a vindication of the whole program. Evidently the Spanish people don\u2019t agree. And if the anti-establishment forces have a recovering Greece to point to, the discrediting of the establishment will accelerate.\n\nOne conclusion, I guess, is that Germany should try to sabotage Greece post-exit. But I hope that will be considered unacceptable.\n\nSo think about it, IFKATs: are you really sure you want to start going down this road?", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20150525092423, "BN": "krugman", "dfp-ad-unit-path": "opinion/krugman", "DISPLAYDATE": "May 25, 2015", "keywords": "Uncategorized", "communityAssetTaxonomy": "blogs/krugman/Grexit and the Morning After ( 20150525 )", "PT": "Blogs", "SCG": "krugman", "sourceApp": "blogs", "twitter": {"description": "What if Greece succeeds?", "title": "Grexit and the Morning After", "url": "http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/05/25/grexit-and-the-morning-after/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "site": "@NytimesKrugman", "card": "summary"}, "adxPage": "blog.nytimes.com/krugman/post", "description": "What if Greece succeeds?", "CG": "Opinion", "robots": "noodp", "dat": "May 25, 2015", "article": {"published_time": 1432560263, "author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/opinion/editorialsandoped/oped/columnists/paulkrugman/index.html", "section": "Opinion", "collection": "http://json8.nytimes.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "tag": "Uncategorized", "modified_time": "2015-05-25T13:24:23-04:00"}, "utime": 20150525132423, "communityAssetLabels": "NYT_Blogs", "PUD": 20150525, "pdate": 20150525, "thumbnail": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "og": {"site_name": "Paul Krugman Blog", "description": "What if Greece succeeds?", "title": "Grexit and the Morning After", "url": "http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/05/25/grexit-and-the-morning-after/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/blogs_v5/../icons/t_logo_291_black.png", "type": "article"}, "communityAssetURL": "http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/05/25/grexit-and-the-morning-after/", "PUV": "normal", "hdl": "Grexit and the Morning After", "thumbnail_150": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "PST": "Blog Post"}, "article_summary": "(Yes, Grexit \u2014 ugly word, but we\u2019re stuck with it.)\nBut the bigger question is what happens a year or two after Grexit, where the real risk to the euro is not that Greece will fail but that it will succeed.\nWe just had another electoral earthquake in the euro area: Podemos-backed candidates have won local elections in Madrid and Barcelona.\nThe latter is dubious economics \u2014 the IMF\u2019s own research doesn\u2019t support enthusiasm about structural reforms, especially in the labor market.\nWhat I would urge everyone to do is ask what happens if Greece is in fact pushed out of the euro."}
