Getty Images\n\nWhatever it takes to get you through the existential emptiness of life\u2014magic, romance or the sheer beauty of the perfect crime\u2014are all familiar themes in Woody Allen\u2019s films, and his latest tongue-in-cheek comedy, \u201cIrrational Man,\u201d is no different.\n\nWarmly applauded at Friday evening\u2019s world premiere in Cannes, Allen\u2019s college town murder mystery gives crime and punishment a slightly different flavor, laced with the finest Scotch and poisoned orange juice.\n\nThe film is set at a small Rhode Island college, and Joaquin Phoenix plays a jaded alcoholic, pot-bellied philosophy professor who arrives to teach summer session. In contrast to the jazzy upbeat score (\u201cThe \u2018In\u2019 Crowd\u201d by the Ramsey Lewis Trio), Lucas is clearly at rock bottom. The more he expounds to his class on the theories of Sartre, Kant, and Heidegger, the deeper he sinks into questioning the meaning of his own life.\n\nAfter a half-hearted affair with a fellow academic, Rita (Parker Posey), fails to boost his morale, along comes a young student, Jill, played by Emma Stone (who starred in Allen\u2019s \u201cMagic in the Moonlight\u2019\u2019).\n\nAnti-intellectual tirades abound. Lucas says in the film, \u201cIf it feels right, it often is\u201d \u2014 a view that the director expressed in a press conference Friday morning.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s no less irrational than some of the choices we all make in our own lives. Joaquin\u2019s character is able to have a much better life, misguided as he is,\u201d Allen said. Likewise, Stone\u2019s character Jill ends up finding out a thing or two, after a close brush with death. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing you can learn in a book,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cYou need something you believe in\u2014you make a choice,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re living in a random universe and you\u2019re living a meaningless life. Everything you create in your life will vanish, the sun and the universe will all be gone one day.\u201d\n\nThe director said he chose movie-making as \u201ca wonderful distraction\u2019\u2019 to combat the heavy weight of existence. \u201cWhat distracts me is\u2014can I get Emma and Parker to do this scene right?\u201d", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "The film is set at a small Rhode Island college, and Joaquin Phoenix plays a jaded alcoholic, pot-bellied philosophy professor.", "title": "Woody Allen\u2019s \u2018Irrational Man\u2019 Premieres at Cannes Film Festival", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2015/05/16/the-unbearable-heaviness-of-being-woody-allens-irrational-man-premieres-in-cannes/", "image": {"src": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-IL496_woody_P_20150516123446.jpg"}, "site": "WSJspeakeasy", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Arts", "article.headline": "Woody Allen\u2019s \u2018Irrational Man\u2019 Premieres at Cannes Film Festival", "description": "The film is set at a small Rhode Island college, and Joaquin Phoenix plays a jaded alcoholic, pot-bellied philosophy professor.", "article_section": "Arts", "author": "Lanie Goodman", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "Speakeasy Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "Speakeasy", "article.summary": "The film is set at a small Rhode Island college, and Joaquin Phoenix plays a jaded alcoholic, pot-bellied philosophy professor.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2015-05-16T16:37:53-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-160", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2015/05/16/the-unbearable-heaviness-of-being-woody-allens-irrational-man-premieres-in-cannes/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-SEB-88815", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Arts", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "The film is set at a small Rhode Island college, and Joaquin Phoenix plays a jaded alcoholic, pot-bellied philosophy professor.", "title": "Woody Allen\u2019s \u2018Irrational Man\u2019 Premieres at Cannes Film Festival", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2015/05/16/the-unbearable-heaviness-of-being-woody-allens-irrational-man-premieres-in-cannes/", "image": {"width": 749, "identifier": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-IL496_woody_P_20150516123446.jpg", "height": 499}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Speakeasy", "article.id": "BL-SEB-88815", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2015-05-16T16:38:24-04:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2b24\"", "article_summary": "From left: Emma Stone, Woody Allen and Parker Posey at the premiere of \u2018Irrational Man\u2019 at the Cannes Film Festival.\nGetty ImagesWhatever it takes to get you through the existential emptiness of life\u2014magic, romance or the sheer beauty of the perfect crime\u2014are all familiar themes in Woody Allen\u2019s films, and his latest tongue-in-cheek comedy, \u201cIrrational Man,\u201d is no different.\n\u201cWhat distracts me is\u2014can I get Emma and Parker to do this scene right?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re living in a random universe and you\u2019re living a meaningless life.\n\u201cIt\u2019s no less irrational than some of the choices we all make in our own lives."}
