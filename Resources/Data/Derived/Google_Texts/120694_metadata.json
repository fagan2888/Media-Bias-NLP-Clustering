Donald Trump announced his campaign with a speech that I know I will never forget. Here are 5 of the most unbelievable things I think Donald said.\n\nDonald Trump, I applaud you. It takes a certain skill to make a Presidential announcement truly memorable. While the 69-year old business icon doesn\u2019t have the years of political experience as the rest of the Republicans running for the 2016 nomination, he certainly has a leg-up on the art of the sound byte. During his speech, The Don said some really unbelievable, head-scratching quotes. Here are the 5 most Outrageous things Donald Trump said during his Presidential Announcement.\n\nDonald\u2019s 2016 Presidential Campaign Announcement speech at Trump Tower in New York City was so full of unforgettable quotes that it was hard to whittle down the list to just five. There were certainly some gems. Whether you agree with his politics or opinions or not, we can agree that Donald certainly made some interesting, it not completely outrageous, comments.\n\n1. \u201c\u2018Number one \u2013 I am a nice person. I give a lot of money away, to charities and other things. I think I\u2019m a very nice person.\u201d\n\nDonald was addressing how a reporter told him, \u201cMr. Trump, you\u2019re not a nice person,\u201d and wondered how he could get people to vote for him. Thankfully, all it takes is a good charitable donation to get people to like you, according to Donald Trump.\n\n2. \u201cWe have a disaster called \u2018The Big Lie:\u2019 Obamacare\u2026.Deductibles are through the roof. You have to get hit by a tractor \u2014 literally, a tractor \u2014 to use it!\u201d\n\nSo, in according to Donald, in order to use a medical insurance plan from the Affordable Care Act (aka \u2018Obamacare\u2019), you need to own a John Deere first. Good to know!\n\n3. \u201cI will build a great, great wall on our southern border and I will make Mexico pay for that wall.\u201d\n\nSecuring the southern border between the United States and Mexico is one thing, but making another country foot the bill for our security is another. Look, I know Donald is a good negotiator, but I don\u2019t think he\u2019s going to talk Mexico into paying for everything.\n\n4. \u201cObamacare kicks in in 2016. Obama\u2019s going to be out playing golf. He might even be on one of my courses, I would invite him, I actually would say. I have the best courses in the world, so I would say \u2014 you know what, if he wants to \u2014 I have one right next to the White House, right on the Potomac. If he\u2019d like to play, that\u2019s fine. In fact, I\u2019d love him to leave early and play.\u201d\n\nFor a moment, it seemed like Donald was running for the President of the Professional Golfers\u2019 Association of America.\n\n5. \u201cI\u2019m really rich.\u201d\n\nJust in case anyone forgot.\n\nBonus: While this isn\u2019t something Donald said, I think it\u2019s hilarious that he came out on the stage to \u201cRockin\u2019 In The Free World,\u201d by Neil Young. The song was written as a critique of then-Republican President George H. W. Bush. Also, Neil Young is a confirmed liberal who probably wouldn\u2019t vote for Donald Trump or like him using his music.\n\nWhat do you think of Donald\u2019s quotes, HollywoodLifers?
