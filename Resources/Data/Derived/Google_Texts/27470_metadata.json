Is poverty caused by conditions beyond individual control, or by bad personal choices? Can the poor help themselves, or is it a social responsibility? In recent days, this debate has been dramatized by the saga of Linda Walther Tirado (pictured at right), the woman who (depending on which side you take) either perpetrated a brazen hoax by offering \u201cpoverty porn\u201d to the gullible left, or told a brave, honest tale of American poverty only to be savaged by the heartless right.\n\nAs is often the case with conflicting politicized narratives, neither one quite matches the facts. Tirado\u2019s story is not quite a hoax; but there is nothing honest about it. It is a combination of partial truths and dramatic embellishments spun into a false narrative with a political agenda.\n\nOn October 22, Tirado, known as \u201cKillerMartinis\u201d in the forums of the Gawker website and its feminist sister site, Jezebel.com, weighed in on a discussion of why poor people often make seemingly irresponsible and self-defeating choices. Tirado\u2019s essay, titled \u201cWhy I Make Terrible Decisions, or, poverty thoughts,\u201d offered a wrenching description of her life as an exhausted mother of two small children working two jobs and taking college classes, regularly getting by on three hours of sleep with the help of coffee and cigarettes. And there were lurid details like trying to battle a cockroach infestation by impaling dead roaches on toothpicks to scare off the living ones.\n\nThe central theme of Tirado\u2019s \u201cthoughts\u201d was that the poor make bad decisions (smoking, having kids they can\u2019t support, buying junk food) because they have no incentive to make good ones: they\u2019re stuck no matter what. \u201c[W]e will never not feel tired,\u201d she declared, in a much-quoted passage. \u201cWe will never feel hopeful. We will never get a vacation. Ever. We know that the very act of being poor guarantees that we will never not be poor. It doesn't give us much reason to improve ourselves.\u201d According to Tirado, not only are the poor too overworked to have the mental energy for forward planning, but they know there\u2019s no point. Besides, they \u201ccan't afford to look nice enough\u201d for decent jobs\u2014in her case, because of bad skin and missing teeth that keep her from working as anything but a chain restaurant cook \u201chidden away in the kitchen.\u201d\n\nDespite a few skeptical commenters, Tirado received overwhelmingly positive feedback; eventually, she wrote to the editor of Jezebel suggesting that her post be promoted on the site\u2019s front page. From there, it made the leap to The Huffington Post and to fame (including a mention on Tour\u00e9\u2019s MSNBC show). Moved by Tirado\u2019s plight, people began to send her money via PayPal and then a GoFundMe account she set up; in late November, she stopped her fundraising at $62,000\u2014to be used not only for dental work but to write a book on her experience of poverty.\n\nIn a November 14 note on her GoFundMe page (which later became the second and, so far, the last entry on her Huffington Post blog, under the title, \u201cMeet the Woman Who Accidentally Explained Poverty to the Nation\u201d), Tirado told her story in more detail\u2014and admitted that her tale of living in desperate poverty wasn\u2019t, strictly speaking, true. Or rather: \u201cWell, it is and it isn't. \u2026 I never meant to say that all of these things were happening to me right now, or that I was still quite so abject.\u201d She revealed that her history included a middle-class upbringing, a great deal of family turmoil, and teenage rebellion. She explained that her teeth were damaged in a car accident caused by a drunk driver when she was 19, then deteriorated because she couldn\u2019t pay for dental care. She also mentioned that she now had \u201cfamily resources,\u201d having reconciled with her parents (actually her grandparents, who had raised her since infancy) when she was pregnant with her first child.\n\nA few days later, the backlash hit. Houston Press blogger Angelica Leicht dug around Tirado\u2019s extensive digital trail and declared her an out-and-out fake\u2014a \u201cprivileged\u201d woman with a boarding school education, a homeowner, a political consultant, and a military wife posing as a poor person. On National Review\u2019s blog, The Corner, David French cited Leicht\u2019s expos\u00e9 and labeled Tirado\u2019s story a \u201cpoverty hoax\u201d eagerly lapped up by the left; he was echoed by Mediaite\u2019s right-of-center columnist Noah Rothman. then, CNN and The New York Times included the Tirado tale in their roundups of recent online hoaxes and fibs.\n\nMeanwhile, The Huffington Post stood by Tirado (notoriously featuring a video clip in which she removed her partial denture and displayed her ruined teeth as proof of her authenticity). The Nation has come to Tirado\u2019s defense as well: in a new post on the magazine\u2019s blog, Michelle Goldberg accuses the media of relying on error-riddled \u201cdebunkings\u201d to paint her as \u201ca middle-class fabulist preying on na\u00efve and guilty liberals.\u201d\n\nGoldberg, who interviewed Tirado and one of her former employers, makes some valid points. Dismissing Tirado\u2019s story of poverty as \u201cfiction\u201d is a stretch, and some claims about her alleged affluence are either inaccurate or exaggerated.\n\nThus, Leicht suggests that Tirado went to the Cranbrook prep school in Michigan, whose alums include Mitt Romney; in fact, Tirado has written that she got a partial scholarship to Cranbrook but her family couldn\u2019t afford the rest of the tuition. (She attended a private religious school.) Leicht also points to Tirado\u2019s profile on the LinkedIn networking site as proof of a flourishing career: \u201cShe's been a freelance writer and political consultant since 2010, and has worked in politics since 2004, a claim backed by 27 decent connections.\u201d But Tirado\u2019s resume on LinkedIn shows only sporadic work in political organizing: nine months in 2004, five months in 2006, two months each in 2007 and 2009. (Her short-lived political blog shows that she also worked on a campaign in 2011.) And 27 connections on LinkedIn is hardly evidence of professional success.\n\nIn her autobiographical note, Tirado, now 31, says that she dropped out of college to embrace a nomadic life of political activism and \u201cwas poor in the way that most people who do not have resources are when they are young and idealistic\u201d\u2014only to slide into real poverty in her late twenties while expecting her first child. By her account, the downward spiral was partly bad luck: her husband\u2019s benefits as an Iraq war veteran were delayed due to an administrative screw-up, and while waiting for the payments to come through the couple lost everything they owned when their basement apartment got flooded. For a while, in 2010, their situation seems to have been genuinely dire; Goldberg provides documents indicating that they relied on public assistance and fought eviction notices. The next year, Tirado\u2019s grandparents, from whom she had been estranged (they are devout Mormon converts, she had come out as a lesbian in her late teens), persuaded her and her husband to move to Utah and set them up in a trailer. After she gave birth to her second child earlier this year, they helped her buy a foreclosed house.\n\nTirado has acknowledged that her initial essay gave the wrong impression that she was still extremely poor. Her defenders assert that she took the initiative in setting the record straight. But while Tirado\u2019s subsequent post telling her life story came two weeks before the \u201cdebunking\u201d began, she was already under pressure from Internet commenters who felt things didn\u2019t quite add up. And even the autobiographical note is not entirely candid about Tirado\u2019s present non-poverty: thus, she mentions that her grandparents \u201chelped us find a house to live in\u201d\u2014but not that the house is her mortgage-free property. (In a discussion of her college plans on Jezebel\u2019s GroupThink forum last August, she says that she\u2019d \u201chate to mortgage the house.\u201d)\n\n\u201cKillerMartinis\u2019\u201d pre-fame forum posts make enough mention of financial difficulties to dispel the notion that her claims of hardship are simply fabricated. But they also clash, disconcertingly, with Tirado\u2019s current self-presentation. For instance, less than two weeks before \u201cPoverty Thoughts,\u201d she was asking for input on \u201cturning my kids' room into a forest\u201d (\u201cI want them to want to play in their own spaces and leave my china cabinet alone\u201d) and discussing \u201cawesome tutorials on making tree stump and mushroom stools.\u201d In a follow-up post, she wrote, \u201cI don't want them spoiled, so I don't want more toys, but I would like them to wake up thinking that life is really cool.\u201d\n\nGibes about the forest room infuriate Tirado\u2019s supporters, who angrily accuse critics of begrudging nice things to the poor. But that\u2019s not the point. The point is that this Linda Tirado\u2014the one who hangs out on Internet forums a lot, ponders the design of forest rooms, and seeks advice on having extramarital affairs because her marriage has grown sexually and emotionally unsatisfying\u2014does not exactly sound like a struggling mom/student/worker too busy to sleep and too tired to think. The disconnect between the two personas is even more jarring in light of Tirado\u2019s more recent claims of suffering near-constant pain and low-grade fever from infections caused by her untreated dental problems.\n\nTirado may not be a \u201cscam artist\u201d or a \u201cfraud,\u201d but her online history does suggest that she is prone to shading the truth. In 2008, during the controversy over the Mormon Church\u2019s involvement in the campaign for California\u2019s same-sex marriage ban, she made a post on a website for Mormon dissenters in which she repeatedly described herself as gay\u2014when, in fact, she was married to a man with whom she had been together for about five years. Sexual identity is a complex issue, and some people continue to identify as gay even when in a long-term relationship with an opposite-sex partner; nonetheless, Tirado was clearly presenting an image of herself that didn\u2019t quite match the reality of her life. And, while her \u201cshould I cheat?\u201d post asserts that her husband was \u201cthe first empenised person I\u2019ve ever been attracted to,\u201d I stumbled on a Reddit comment in which she mentions an ex-boyfriend.\n\nMore relevant to the story that catapulted her to fame, in a post on Reddit about a year ago Tirado wrote that she \u201cmanage[s] a fast food restaurant\u201d\u2014referring to the employees as \u201cmy crew\u201d\u2014and shared a spirited tale of putting an obnoxious customer in her place after being \u201ccalled to the counter\u201d to deal with the woman\u2019s complaint. That\u2019s rather a far cry from the \u201cpoverty thoughts\u201d narrator who is relegated to the kitchen because of her unsightly teeth.\n\nAbout those teeth: The reason Tirado dramatically displayed them on camera is that, after her November 25 interview on Huffington Post Live, many people were startled by the lack of any visible damage to her teeth. In the video, she sarcastically thanks the doubters, saying that their skepticism was a compliment on how well she has trained herself to look normal\u2014despite a broken denture that could fall out any time she laughs or chews. Yet in the same clip, Tirado coughs vigorously at one point, with no apparent ill effect. When she removes her partial denture, the missing upper front teeth are clearly visible but there is no evidence that the denture is broken.\n\nIn any case, if Tirado can present a normal appearance\u2014and, despite claims to the contrary, there are plenty of moments in the HuffPost Live interview when she shows her teeth while speaking or smiling\u2014this seriously undercuts her claim that her bad teeth keep her from getting a decent job. (In fact, her second job\u2014of which her autobiographical post says only that it pays better than the one at the restaurant\u2014is a \u201crespectable\u201d one with a disability nonprofit.)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "Like millions of Americans, Linda Tirado will overcome temporary poverty.
