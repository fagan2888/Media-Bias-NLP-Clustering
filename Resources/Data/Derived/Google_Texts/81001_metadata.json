Mr Brown rang the number several times but each time found it was engaged. So he called the next number on the list, a teletype one for the deaf and found himself on the sex chatline.\n\nI guess it\u2019s now \u201cUncovered California.\u201d\n\nA video report is below:\n\nIt gets better. Officials first denied the phone number was wrong.\n\nCovered California spokesman Roy Kennedy at first tried to deny the sex chat number had been listed on the company\u2019s contact list. But he then admitted it, The Daily Mail said. \u201cAfter investigating it further, we are reviewing the shop-and-compare tool as an incorrect number,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re currently working to correct the problem.\u201d\n\nPerhaps if this wasn\u2019t the only phone-number glitch to occur in the roll-out process, it would be more of a laughing matter.\n\nBut a New York cupcake shop was deluged with calls that was the result of their state\u2019s exchange screw-up.\n\nIn yet another bungle for the botched government insurance rollout, the state Health Department has mistakenly listed numerous non-health-related business as enrollment sites \u2014 including a Brooklyn cupcake shop that has been besieged by callers. \u201cI have nothing to do with this,\u201d said Carmen Rodriguez owner of Brooklyn Cupcake in Williamsburg. \u201cI run a very busy establishment, and I\u2019m like, what is going on?\u201d\n\nThen, there was a Seattle pottery shop that was slammed with misdirected calls.\n\nCritics said Saturday that the latest problem to hit Maryland\u2019s online health exchange \u2014 an incorrect help-line number that directed hundreds of callers to a Seattle-based pottery business \u2014 was another symptom of the poorly operating website. \u201cYou can\u2019t make this stuff up, and I guess if it wasn\u2019t so serious, it could be funny,\u201d said Senate Minority Leader David R. Brinkley, a Frederick County Republican.\n\nPerhaps if we put Ernestine in charge of giving out the proper phone number, that would help?\n\nHowever, if this is a sample of how the new health insurance sign-up is being run, I shudder to think about the billing process.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Deaf citizens of California were directed to a sex hotline by the Covered California website in the latest episode of \"wrong number theater\" for Obamacare.", "generator": "WordPress 4.3.1", "og": {"site_name": "Le\u00b7gal In\u00b7sur\u00b7rec\u00b7tion", "description": "While President Obama was doing a \"victory lap\" over the truly questionable healthcare exchange enrollment numbers, the deaf citizens of California were being directed to a sex hotline by the Covered California website:\r\nAuburn resident Jeff Brown was one who went on the Covered California", "title": "Obamacare Dials Another Wrong Number", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://legalinsurrection.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/LI-17-phone-e1396484426313.png", "updated_time": "2014-04-02T23:26:05+00:00", "url": "http://legalinsurrection.com/2014/04/obamacare-dials-another-wrong-number/", "type": "article"}, "google-site-verification": "f_SDILa9XMa3xcLX9n6eq0yDinw8hWKIjXr-0IOcgIE", "article": {"section": "Uncategorized", "published_time": "2014-04-03T08:30:22+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-04-02T23:26:05+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcfd58\"", "article_summary": "While President Obama was doing a \u201cvictory lap\u201d over the truly questionable healthcare exchange enrollment numbers, the deaf citizens of California were being directed to a sex hotline by the Covered California website:Auburn resident Jeff Brown was one who went on the Covered California site to fill in his details but saw a pop-up telling him to call a 1-800 number, a freefone number in America.\nCovered California spokesman Roy Kennedy at first tried to deny the sex chat number had been listed on the company\u2019s contact list.\nBut a New York cupcake shop was deluged with calls that was the result of their state\u2019s exchange screw-up.\nSo he called the next number on the list, a teletype one for the deaf and found himself on the sex chatline.\nHowever, if this is a sample of how the new health insurance sign-up is being run, I shudder to think about the billing process."}
