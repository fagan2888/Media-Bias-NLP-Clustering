Iowans, for instance, will see their premiums spike by 22 percent this year. In Minnesota, Alaska, Tennessee, and Hawaii, rates will rise by 30 percent or more.\u201d\n\nThis will not be the first time Alabamians have experienced a significant premium spike under ObamaCare.\n\nIn 2014, the Heritage Foundation found that premiums for young Alabamians had increased by an average of 31 percent. Incredibly, Heritage also found that to be a \u201cgood deal\u201d compared to many other states around the country. Many states have experienced 70 percent, 80 percent, even 100 percent hikes. Alabama\u2019s neighbor to the east, Georgia, has seen their premiums jump by an astounding 168 percent for 27-year-olds under the president\u2019s healthcare law.\n\nObamaCare insurance exchange rates increased overall in 97 percent of Alabama counties in 2014.\n\nThe cost increases have hit Alabama teachers especially hard.\n\nBeginning October 1st of last year, copays for some specialists increased $5, education employees who smoke saw their tobacco use surcharge nearly double from $28 a month to $50, and fees for spouses began increasing by $25 a year before capping in 2018 at $75.\n\nBy some estimates, the Public Education Employees\u2019 Health Insurance Plan (PEEHIP) is facing a $140 million shortfall in 2016, which administrators are blaming on an increase in the cost of healthcare. \u201cThe bottom line is that health insurance costs are skyrocketing everywhere,\u201d said Retirement Systems of Alabama Deputy Director Don Yancey. \u201cIt\u2019s not just in Alabama. Other states are faced with this same problem\u2026 I don\u2019t think anyone would try and sit there with a straight face and tell you that health insurance is cheaper than it was eight years ago.\u201d\n\nObamaCare has also been blamed with causing a substitute teacher shortage, due to its requirement to provide health insurance for any employee working more than 30 hours a week.\n\nBecause the school system cannot afford to pay the estimated $10,000 per substitute per year cost of providing health insurance to any sub working more than 30 hours a week, classes often have to double up, or full-time teachers must take turns popping in during their planning periods to create a patchwork cover for the children whose teacher is out.\n\nExpected 2016 premium spikes for each state can be found in the chart below.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Research by Freedom Partners Chamber of Commerce shows Alabama's ObamaCare premiums increasing by 28 percent in 2016.", "og": {"site_name": "Yellowhammer News", "description": "ARLINGTON, Va. \u2014 According to a newly released study by Freedom Partners Chamber of Commerce, Alabama\u2019s health insurance premiums on the individual marketplace are expected rise in 2016 faster than[...]", "title": "Study: Alabama's ObamaCare premiums expected to spike double-digits, again - Yellowhammer News", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 720, "identifier": "http://yellowhammernews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/ObamaCare.jpg", "height": 340}, "updated_time": "2016-01-13T15:00:54-05:00", "url": "http://yellowhammernews.com/politics-2/study-alabamas-obamacare-premiums-expected-to-spike-double-digits-again/", "type": "article"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "1bb21e647809aaf739789565c0783008"}, "fb": {"pages": 303363616352436}, "article": {"section": "Politics", "tag": "spike", "published_time": "2016-01-12T10:54:38-05:00", "modified_time": "2016-01-13T15:00:54-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "\u201cIn most states, health insurance premiums on the individual marketplace are rising by double digits under ObamaCare,\u201d Freedom Partners explained in a release.\nAccording to the data, Alabamians can expect their insurance premiums to spike by as much as 28 percent.\nIowans, for instance, will see their premiums spike by 22 percent this year.\nIn Minnesota, Alaska, Tennessee, and Hawaii, rates will rise by 30 percent or more.\u201dThis will not be the first time Alabamians have experienced a significant premium spike under ObamaCare.\nARLINGTON, Va. \u2014 According to a newly released study by Freedom Partners Chamber of Commerce, Alabama\u2019s health insurance premiums on the individual marketplace are expected rise in 2016 faster than almost any other state in the country."}
