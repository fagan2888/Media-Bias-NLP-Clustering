She said Obama\u2019s plan to indefinitely delay deportation for millions of undocumented immigrants \"is limited in the scope that it covers.\u201d\n\nThe reforms the president intends to detail tonight would only delay deportations for immigrants without major criminal violations on their records for five years. It would also reportedly not offer undocumented immigrants government subsidies for health care under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nObama\u2019s planned actions could impact an estimated five million undocumented immigrants now in the U.S.\n\nEsty and U.S. Rep. Joe Courtney, D-2, agree that the president\u2019s plan to defer action on deportations for millions of immigrants \u201cis well within the executive branch\u2019s authority.\u201d\n\nCongressional Republican leaders are angry about Obama\u2019s proposed actions, insisting they would exceed the president\u2019s authority on immigration issues.\n\nState Rep. Arthur O\u2019Neill, a deputy Republican House leader from Southbury, is of the same opinion. \u201cI think he really should wait for Congress,\u201d O\u2019Neill said. \u201cThe president has been saying for years he didn\u2019t have the authority for what he now says he has authority to do.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen a legislative body decides not to do something the executive branch wants to do, that should be the end of it,\u201d O\u2019Neill said. Overriding the will of a legislature in such cases \u201cis the way the Czar used to rule, or the Kaiser used to rule\u2026 That\u2019s never been the system in this country.\u201d\n\nBut Courtney said \u201cprevious administrations have repeatedly done\u201d similar actions.\n\nCourtney and Esty said President Obama\u2019s unilateral actions needs to be followed up by congressional passage of far more comprehensive reform. Courtney said Obama\u2019s executive order is expected to \u201cleave unaddressed a number of issues.\u201d\n\nConnecticut\u2019s congressional delegation has been pushing for U.S. House action on a bipartisan immigration reform plan approved by the Senate more than a year ago. House GOP leaders have refused to bring the bill up for a vote.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a perfect bill,\u201d said Esty, \u201cbut it\u2019s much better than our badly broken immigration system.\u201d She said the Senate measure would provide an \u201cearned path to citizenship\u201d for undocumented immigrants, offer a means to secure the U.S. borders, and would \u201ckeep families together.\u201d\n\nCodognolla was born in Brazil and came to the U.S. 14 years ago at age nine. He applied for and was granted protection from deportation in 2012 as one of Connecticut\u2019s student \u201cDreamers.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt really changed my life,\u201d Codognolla said, explaining he was able to continue his studies at the University of Connecticut. A Stamford resident, Codognolla graduated in December and now works as a para-legal at the office of an immigration lawyer.", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Obama Immigration Reforms An Incomplete Victory Say Connecticut Activists, U.S. Representatives", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Hartford Courant", "author": "Hartford Courant", "og": {"site_name": "courant.com", "description": "Connecticut immigration activists like Lucas Codognolla believe President Obama \u2019s plan to push ahead with reforms on his own is a \u201cmonumental win for the immigrant rights movement,\u201d but one that remains incomplete.", "title": "Obama Immigration Reforms An Incomplete Victory Say Connecticut Activists, U.S. Representatives", "url": "http://www.courant.com/politics/capitol-watch/hc-obama-immigration-reforms-an-incomplete-victory-say-connecticut-activists-us-representatives-20141120-story.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-546e30f9/turbine/hc-obama-immigration-reforms-an-incomplete-victory-say-connecticut-activists-us-representatives-20141120", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp01.14", "twitter": {"site": "@hartfordcourant", "card": "summary"}, "keywords": "immigration, deportation, Obama, reform", "robots": "index,follow", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=391113483, app-argument=http://www.courant.com/deeplinkid/82036210", "fb": {"admins": 14500562, "page_id": 49693986601, "app_id": 152391743139}, "googlebot-news": "index", "date": "2014-11-20", "Description": "Activists, CT's congressional delegation say Obama immigration reforms a stop-gap, more congressional action needed", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "immigration, deportation, Obama, reform"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd151\"", "article_summary": "Connecticut immigration activists like Lucas Codognolla believe President Obama\u2019s plan to push ahead with reforms on his own is a \u201cmonumental win for the immigrant rights movement,\u201d but one that remains incomplete.\nIt would also reportedly not offer undocumented immigrants government subsidies for health care under the Affordable Care Act.\nCourtney and Esty said President Obama\u2019s unilateral actions needs to be followed up by congressional passage of far more comprehensive reform.\n\u201cThese actions [by President Obama] would only provide limited, temporary relief,\u201d said Congresswoman Elizabeth Esty, D-5.\n\u201cObviously, it won\u2019t be perfect because it leaves out millions of people,\u201d Codognolla, a member of Connecticut Students for a DREAM, said Thursday."}
