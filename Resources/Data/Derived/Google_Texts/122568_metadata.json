It\u2019s just possible there\u2019s a treatment that can nip a problem in the bud if treatment is started soon enough.\n\nCastner learned at age 63 that he has a progressive, incurable lung disease called idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, or IPF, that more often than not seems to come out of nowhere (idiopathic means of no known cause).\n\nCastner, now 67, was no slouch at the time. He had been an avid backpacker, cyclist, hiker, skier and gardener. But in 2012, while hiking with his family in the Lake Tahoe area at nearly 7,000 feet above sea level, he experienced \u201cpronounced shortness of breath,\u201d his wife, Susan, told me.\n\nTwo months later, a pulmonologist diagnosed IPF, a disease that reduces the lungs\u2019 ability to extract oxygen from the air and distribute it to the rest of the body. At the time, there were no effective treatments in the United States. But there was a drug in use in Europe called Esbriet that had been shown to slow the loss of lung function and significantly reduce deaths.\n\nIn October 2014, the Food and Drug Administration approved Esbriet as well as a second drug for IPF, called Ofev. Two months earlier, under a special permit, doctors at the University of California, San Francisco, started Castner on Esbriet. He said he could still get along without supplemental oxygen, even when working in the garden with his wife.\n\n\u201cI can get breathy if I have to lift things, so Susan steps in to help,\u201d he said. \u201cI have no problem with her doing some of the heavy work. I like hanging with her.\u201d\n\nHe wonders, though, how much better off he might be now if he had been able to start one of the new drugs at the time of his diagnosis, when his loss of lung function was only at 20 percent, rather than when he was finally able to get the drug, when his loss was at 60 percent.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve experienced no change in my condition, no major deterioration, since I started on Esbriet,\u201d Castner told me, adding that he has been free of the drug\u2019s possible side effects. Now he is hellbent on getting the word out to the more than 100,000 people in this country known to have idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, along with many others who have yet to learn this is why they are often breathless.\n\nDr. Talmadge E. King, Jr., the dean of the medical school at UCSF who directed one of the definitive studies of Esbriet, said that the drug \u201creduced by about 48 percent the proportion of patients who declined, showing that the drug worked to slow the rate at which patients got worse. The mortality rate dropped more than we expected.\u201d\n\nKing said, \u201cWhen I started in pulmonology 30 years ago, everyone with this disease died. Now we can say to patients that you\u2019re going to get worse, but at a slower rate, and you\u2019re going to be alive.\u201d\n\nAs Castner put it: \u201cWhen I was first diagnosed, I started thinking about the last things I\u2019d get to see before I died. Now I don\u2019t think about death. I have this disease \u2014 it\u2019s a fact of life \u2014 and even though I can\u2019t do all the physical stuff I used to do, I can still cook and garden with my wife, go out to dinner, walk on flat surfaces and enjoy a glass of wine with friends.\u201d\n\nMore than 14,000 patients in this country have begun treatment with Esbriet, so clearly there are many more who might benefit from it or Ofev, a much newer drug with a somewhat different mechanism of action. Studies are planned to see if the two drugs together \u2014 or with other drugs now in development \u2014 might be more beneficial than either alone.\n\nThough categorized as a rare disease, \u201cIPF is much more common than is usually realized,\u201d said Dr. Steven Nathan, a pulmonologist at Inova Fairfax Hospital in Falls Church, Virginia. \u201cAnd for whatever reason, its prevalence is increasing.\u201d\n\nOn average, it takes patients with IPF two years to receive a correct diagnosis. People often attribute their breathlessness to being unfit or growing older because IPF is typically a disease of older people. And doctors often mistake it for asthma, heart disease or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or confuse it with one of the dozens of other interstitial lung diseases. In addition to shortness of breath, sometimes even during normal daily activities, a persistent cough that does not produce phlegm is a common symptom.\n\nEsbriet, known generically as pirfenidone and marketed by Roche, is thought to counter lung fibrosis by decreasing the production of collagen and factors that promote growth and inflammation. It is not recommended for people with liver though I can\u2019t do all the physical stuff I used to do, I can still cook and garden with my wife, go out to dinner, walk on flat surfaces and enjoy a glass of wine with friends.\u201d\n\nMore than 14,000 patients in this country have begun treatment with Esbriet, so clearly there are many more who might benefit from it or Ofev, a much newer drug with a somewhat different mechanism of action.

Ofev, known generically as nintedanib, is marketed by Boehringer Ingelheim; it too inhibits fibrosis by targeting various growth factors.\n\nCastner, who receives Esbriet free through Medicare, said that without insurance, the drug would cost $94,000 a year. Ofev is slightly more expensive, $96,000 a year.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://health.heraldtribune.com/files/2011/10/newjamnebrody.jpg"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}}, "article_summary": "Ofev, known generically as nintedanib, is marketed by Boehringer Ingelheim; it too inhibits fibrosis by targeting various growth factors.\nAnd doctors often mistake it for asthma, heart disease or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or confuse it with one of the dozens of other interstitial lung diseases.\nCastner learned at age 63 that he has a progressive, incurable lung disease called idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, or IPF, that more often than not seems to come out of nowhere (idiopathic means of no known cause).\nThough categorized as a rare disease, \u201cIPF is much more common than is usually realized,\u201d said Dr. Steven Nathan, a pulmonologist at Inova Fairfax Hospital in Falls Church, Virginia.\nEsbriet, known generically as pirfenidone and marketed by Roche, is thought to counter lung fibrosis by decreasing the production of collagen and factors that promote growth and inflammation."}
