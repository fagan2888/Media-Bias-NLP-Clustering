In his early movies, Quentin Tarantino loved using “the n word.” At the Golden Globes tonight, he pulled another racially-loaded term as he praised Ennio Morricone, who won best original score for Tarantino’s “The Hateful Eight.”

Tarantino called Morricone “my favorite composer.” He didn’t mean just movie composers — “that ghetto — but “I’m talking Mozart, I’m talking Beethoven, I’m talking Schubert.”

So far, with the win for “Mozart in the Jungle,” it’s been a big night at the Globes for classical music. But “ghetto,” no matter how Tarantino might have intended it, is a racially-charged term, and Tarantino has unleashed something online.
