STAUNTON — Emmett Hanger is getting something he hasn't had in seven years – a primary challenger.

Marshall Pattie, Augusta County Supervisor for the North River District, will seek the Republican nomination for the 24th Senate district seat for the 2015 election against Hanger, R-Mount Solon.

The last time Hanger faced a party challenger was in June 2007, when he narrowly fended off a challenge by Lexington businessman Scott Sayre.

The 24th District encompasses Augusta, Madison and Greene counties, part of Rockingham County, the cities of Staunton, Waynesboro and part of Culpeper.

Pattie's challenge come on the heels of the recent debate in the General Assembly over accepting federal funds to expand Medicaid in accordance with the Affordable Care Act. The move is backed by Gov. Terry McAuliffe and the Democrats, while Hanger is one of only three Republicans in the state senate who support the move, earning him the wrath of conservatives within his own party.

Pattie, a management professor at James Madison University who lives near Staunton with his wife and two children, is known for his hard stance against raising taxes in Augusta County, something he's remained firm about during his time as a supervisor.

Pattie makes the formal announcement on his candidacy at 12:30 p.m. Monday at the Reo Distribution Center in Waynesboro.

Pattie has held his county supervisor position since 2012, winning it as an independent. The supervisor was formerly chairman of the Augusta County Democratic Committee.

"Marshall is a down-to-earth guy and he is really easy to talk to," said Cole Trower, a representative of Pattie's campaign.

Hanger and Pattie could not be reached for comment.

(6/30: Updated to reflect that Pattie lives near Staunton with a Staunton mailing address.)
