Charleston Police and firefighters were forced to go into rescue mode Sunday to evacuate residents in parts of the Shadowmoss subdivision.

Flood waters found their way into some homes, frightening residents.

Greg Martin, his wife and pet bird were rescued and reunited with their worried daughter.

Martin had nothing but praise for the rescuers.

"The most wonderful people, what would we do without them," Martin said. "Thank you guys, saved my bird, me and my wife. It's been a harrowing couple of days."

Crews were kept busy all day evacuating people, then going back through the flooded streets to save more folks.

Robert Lewe was rescued from his home in the Bridgepoint section.

That is the same neighborhood that was severely flooded back in August.

"Got up around two o'clock in the morning and I saw that there's 30 inches of water," Lewe said. "Had it cleaned up August 31 and I thought everything was fine."

A woman told us there were fish swimming around in her mom's house.

Forrest Cooke was one of the lucky ones.

He managed to keep water from coming into his house.

"If the water raises about another six inches or so it's gonna start coming through the front door, so we're hoping to put these sandbags in place," Cooke said. "It will save us a little bit of a headache, but it's not looking very good."

With more rain in the forecast, it's going to be awhile before the neighborhood gets back to normal.
