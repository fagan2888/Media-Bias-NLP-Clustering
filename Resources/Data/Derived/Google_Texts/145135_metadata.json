Under HIPP, Nebraskans can get reimbursed the cost of private health insurance coverage if that\u2019s cheaper than the person enrolling in Medicaid.\n\nThe audit found DHHS \u201cflagrantly disregarded its own regulations\u201d in managing the program, resulting in large payments to ineligible people. Auditors found duplicate payments, errors and other financial discrepancies. While announcing the results of his audit, Foley said it also appeared some people were knowingly, fraudulently getting benefits.\n\nState auditors found hundreds of thousands of dollars in errors in 53 of the 70 most expensive cases they reviewed.\n\n\u201cAll in all, this program is one grand mess in need of radical surgery,\u201d Foley said in May. \u201cThe shocking level of mismanagement coupled with inattentive supervisions created a perfect storm, resulting in years of wasting large sums of taxpayer money.\u201d\n\nFoley said the biggest problem was that the department failed to do even one cost-benefit analysis for any of the program participants, so it couldn\u2019t have known whether it was cheaper to subsidize health insurance coverage.\n\nIn response, Medicaid Director Vivianne Chaumont vowed to review the program and drop participants who didn\u2019t qualify for payments. She also said a recommendation would be made about whether to continue the program, since it\u2019s no longer a federally mandated program and that area of Medicaid is changing as managed care expands.\n\nHHS spokesman Russ Reno said the department reviewed 455 HIPP cases, of which 240 recipients were notified there wasn\u2019t enough documentation to justify the cost-effectiveness of their participation in the program.\n\nOf those, 75 appeals were filed and 33 successfully showed it was cost-effective for them to stay in the program, with 35 appeals scheduled for consideration.\n\nOne woman who didn\u2019t want to be named because she\u2019s appealing her termination from the program said the state ombudsman\u2019s office was looking into the situation.\n\nFoley and HHS CEO Kerry Winterer laid the blame for problems on an employee who administered the program single-handedly with inadequate supervision. In one case, the department paid more than $265,000 in premiums when it clearly would have been cheaper to put the person on Medicaid. The HHS file indicated the HIPP administrator was well aware that it wasn\u2019t cost-effective, but continued to make payments of more than $9,000 per month for health insurance premiums.\n\nAuditors also found cases in which the state was reimbursing for the more costly employer portion health insurance costs, not the employee portion, resulting in a $20,000 overpayment in one case and $38,000 in another.\n\nAuditors also found numerous cases in which participants were paying no premiums for health insurance, but were getting HIPP payments, to the tune of $29,000 in one case.\n\nAuditors also found the agency incorrectly paid thousands of dollars for dental insurance, vision insurance, long-term disability insurance, life insurance \u2014 even parking expenses, even though they weren\u2019t allowable.\n\nContact Deena Winter at deena@nebraskawatchdog.org.
