This typically includes being employed. Because of this basic economic fact, I found it alarming that more than 1/3 of the work force just doesn\u2019t want a job. The Wall Street Journal has the numbers:\n\n34.3%: Share of Americans over age 16 who say they don\u2019t want a job, up from about 30% two decades ago. Americans aren\u2019t just leaving the labor force \u2014 those who have left it are drifting further away.\n\nBeing unemployed is a major problem.

And they uncover an interesting previously unnoticed trend: As a share of all those \u201cnot in the labor force,\u201d the number of people who want a job has been generally declining since the early 1980s.\n\nRecently in the Green Room:", "article_metadata": {"description": "34.3 percent of Americans don\u2019t want a job", "generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "The Greenroom", "description": "At some point in our lives, each of us has said to ourselves, \u201cWow I really wish I didn\u2019t have to work.\u201d Shortly after making that statement, we snap back into reality and underst\u2026", "title": "34.3 percent of Americans don\u2019t want a job", "url": "http://hotair.com/greenroom/archives/2013/11/04/34-3-percent-of-americans-dont-want-a-job/", "image": {"secure_url": "https://i2.wp.com/i847.photobucket.com/albums/ab40/katiepavlich/Screenshot2013-11-04at12037PM_zps4d20d754.png", "identifier": "http://i847.photobucket.com/albums/ab40/katiepavlich/Screenshot2013-11-04at12037PM_zps4d20d754.png"}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://i847.photobucket.com/albums/ab40/katiepavlich/Screenshot2013-11-04at12037PM_zps4d20d754.png?w=1400", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "article": {"published_time": "2013-11-04T18:16:56+00:00", "modified_time": "2013-11-04T18:16:56+00:00"}, "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde02d\"", "article_summary": "Because of this basic economic fact, I found it alarming that more than 1/3 of the work force just doesn\u2019t want a job.\nThe Wall Street Journal has the numbers:34.3%: Share of Americans over age 16 who say they don\u2019t want a job, up from about 30% two decades ago.\nAmericans aren\u2019t just leaving the labor force \u2014 those who have left it are drifting further away.\nIn a new paper, economists Regis Barnichon and Andrew Figura divide up those out of the labor force using a simpler standard: whether or not the person says they want a job.\nAnd they uncover an interesting previously unnoticed trend: As a share of all those \u201cnot in the labor force,\u201d the number of people who want a job has been generally declining since the early 1980s."}
