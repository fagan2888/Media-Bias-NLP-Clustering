North Dakota leads the nation in personal income growth. No other state even comes close.

From 2008 to 2012, North Dakotans’ per-capita income jumped 31 percent to $57,367, the highest of any state and just behind Washington, D.C., according to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis.

South Dakota came in a distant second at 10 percent.

A Federal Reserve study issued last week showed North Dakota leading the nation in “progress toward recovery” from 2007 to 2013.
