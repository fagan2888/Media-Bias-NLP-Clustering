Particularly, Seahawks fans.\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\nAccording to new data from Orbitz.com, 21% more Seattle fans are flying into New York airports than Denver supporters. But no matter where their flights take off, fans will be paying more for tickets this year than they have in years\u2019 past, Orbitz finds. Those flying in from Seattle will pay on average $435, up 19% week over week while Denver fans will dish out an average of $326, up 24% from last week\u2019s fare.\n\nWhen it comes to hotels this year, prices on average are down from housing costs for last year\u2019s game in New Orleans. Orbtiz senior editor Jeanenne Tornatore says it\u2019s simply a supply and demand issue.\n\n\u201cLast year, the average daily hotel rate in New Orleans was around $500 a night, but this year it\u2019s between $300 and $400 a night,\u201d she says. \u201cThat is primarily because of the size of the market\u2014there\u2019s a big discrepancy. In New Orleans there were about 37,000 units available, and in New York, there\u2019s 90,000.\u201d\n\nTornatore says its likely more Seahawks fans are flying in and paying more because the franchise has only been to the big game once, eight years ago, and lost. Denver will be making its sixth appearance at this year\u2019s game.\n\n\u201c[Seahawks] fans are really excited to see their team go to the Super Bowl,\u201d she says. \u201cIt hasn\u2019t been as long since the Broncos were in the Super Bowl. That might be a reason [Seahawks] fans are more excited to get back into the game and take part in the festivities.\u201d\n\nContinue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT\n\nFor fans around the MetLife stadium in New Jersey who can\u2019t afford pricey tickets to the game\u2014which now top $4,000 per ticket according to TiqIQ\u2014there are numerous events during Super Bowl week and weekend in the Big Apple.\n\n\u201cIt happens to be Broadway Week, some theaters have two-for-one tickets to shows,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd on Super Bowl morning, there is a four-mile race in Central park.
