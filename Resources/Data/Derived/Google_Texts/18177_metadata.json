In 2014, spending on prescription drugs amounted to an estimated $275.9bn, compared with $262.3bn in 2013.\n\n\u201cAround 20 provisions of the healthcare legislation are expected to have a direct or indirect impact on the volume of drug and biologic sales. As many as 32 million formerly uninsured citizens could enter the patient pool, resulting in new business worth $115bn over a period of 10 years.\u201d\n\nGlobalData's report also notes that the FDA's \u201ctransparent, well-structured and competent regulatory system\u201d that facilitates the approval of pharmaceutical products is also consequently bolstering market growth.\n\nOwide continued: \u201cNew initiatives undertaken by the FDA to strengthen the review and approval process will be advantageous to the industry. Its strong patent system attracts research-based pharmaceutical companies and positively influences growth.\n\n\u201cIn 2014, 41 novel drugs were approved by the FDA, 17 of which were for the treatment of rare diseases. Schemes such as the FDA's 'Fast Track Development Program' and 'Breakthrough Designation' accelerate the approval of novel drugs and add value to the market by meeting demand more quickly.\u201d\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.", "article_metadata": {"DC.identifier": 684238, "msvalidate.01": "0EC42B8AFF32E3F8AF94AE970DE63445", "DC.coverage": "World", "Listing Name": "US pharma market to reach $550bn by 2020", "DC.language": "en", "DC.title": "US pharma market to reach $550bn by 2020", "DC.type": "text", "primary_section": "Sales", "DC.date": "2015-03-19 11:38:39", "theme": "sales", "FB_searchresultformat": "News Article", "FB_searchresult_listingurl": "http://www.pmlive.com/__data/assets/image/0005/422879/varieties/listing.jpg", "sections": "Sales; PME", "tags": "US health reform; Obama; GlobalData", "DC.format": "News Article", "DC.publisher": "PMGroup Worldwide Limited", "FB_searchresultname": "US pharma market to reach $550bn by 2020", "14days": "2015-04-02 11:35:29", "viewport": "width=device-width", "DC.description": "Health reforms and the new FDA initiatives among the factors that will help it grow", "Author Name": "Ben Adams", "DC.rights": "All content copyright \u00a9 PMGroup Worldwide Limited.", "FB_searchresult_headlineurl": "http://www.pmlive.com/__data/assets/image/0005/422879/varieties/headline.jpg", "1month": "2015-04-19 11:35:30"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca5ef\"", "article_summary": "In 2014, spending on prescription drugs amounted to an estimated $275.9bn, compared with $262.3bn in 2013.\nThe US pharmaceutical market is forecast to jump in value from $395bn in 2014 to $548bn by the end of the decade, according to research and consulting firm GlobalData.\n\u201cIn 2014, 41 novel drugs were approved by the FDA, 17 of which were for the treatment of rare diseases.\nOwide continued: \u201cNew initiatives undertaken by the FDA to strengthen the review and approval process will be advantageous to the industry.\nThe company's latest report finds that this is a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 5.6%, and will be driven by a number of factors."}
