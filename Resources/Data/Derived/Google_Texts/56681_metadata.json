According to a report from ABC News on Monday, the Transportation Security Agency\u2019s own internal review determined that 95 percent of attempts to smuggle weapons and explosives through airline security checks were successful.\n\nThe report, based on information ABC described as coming from TSA officials briefed on the issue, said that the TSA\u2019s \u201cred teams,\u201d which try to breach security in an effort to test the agency\u2019s processes, have found major flaws in the system meant to keep travelers safe.\n\nRelated: Why a Military Victory Over ISISIs Wishful Thinking\n\nAccording to ABC, red teams conducted 70 separate attempts to get illegal material through security checks, and succeeded 67 times. The attempts included explosive devices attached to agents\u2019 bodies under clothing and other contraband.\n\nAccording to the report, Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson was personally briefed on the findings, and a spokesperson for the agency told ABC that the TSA would be required to adopt a number of new procedures in order to tighten security in the nation\u2019s airports.\n\nThe TSA findings, reportedly included in a forthcoming Inspector General\u2019s report, are likely to further inflame a simmering conflict between the TSA and members of Congress with oversight of the agency.\n\nThe report comes about one month after the TSA's acting administrator failed to show up to a House Oversight Committee hearing specifically intended to discuss whether the agency is providing sufficient security to protect the country's airports.\n\nCommittee Chairman Jason Chaffetz (R-UT) invited TSA's acting chief Melvin Carraway to testify before the hearing to defend his agency against two watchdog reports questioning the TSA's security efforts.\n\nRelated: How Safe Is that Flight? Auditors Question Airport Security\n\nHowever, the agency asked to send a deputy staff member in his place, a move that was not warmly received by Chaffetz, who rejected the request and blasted the TSA chief for being a no-show.\n\nA spokesperson for the TSA said Carraway didn't attend the hearing because a member of the panel was from the private sector, and the agency's head only participates in congressional hearing panels with other government agencies to \"avoid conflicts of interest.\"\n\nBrianna Ehley contributed to this article.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "TSA personnel sent to test their own agency\u2019s procedures at airports were able to smuggle explosive devices and other contraband through security checkpoints 95 percent of the time, according to a new report.
