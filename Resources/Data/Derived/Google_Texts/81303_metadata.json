(Photo: Gord Horne, Getty Images/iStockphoto)\n\nHILLSBOROUGH The cause of a fire that destroyed a Bigley Court home on Sunday afternoon is still under investigation.\n\n\n\nNo one was injured in the fire at the house owned by Philip and Robin Acone.\n\n\n\nHillsborough volunteer firefighter Lt. Tom Marvits was able to rescue the family cat and bring it to safety from the blaze that broke out around 1 p.m.\n\n\n\nWhen township police arrived, the Acones had already gotten out of the two-story house off Westcott Road. Police found that the rear of the house was fully engulfed in flames. The fire was placed under control by 2:30 p.m. and firefighters remained until the evening.\n\n\n\nThe fire does not appear to be suspicious, police say. The house has been deemed uninhabitable by township officials.\n\n\n\nResponding to the fire were township police, all of the township volunteer fire departments, Hillsborough Rescue Squad and fire departments from Millstone Valley, Country Hills, Elizabeth Avenue and Montgomery. Also responding were the Somerville Rescue Squad, Hillsborough Office of Emergency Management, PSE&G, the township Department of Public Works and the township Fire Safety Bureau.\n\nStaff Writer Mike Deak: 908-243-6607; mdeak@mycentraljersey.com\n\nRead or Share this story: http://mycj.co/1KGqBct", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "The cause of a fire which destroyed a Hillsborough home  on Sunday afternoon is still under investigation.", "og": {"site_name": "MY CENTRAL JERSEY", "description": "The cause of a fire which destroyed a Hillsborough home  on Sunday afternoon is still under investigation.", "title": "Fire destroys Hillsborough home", "url": "http://www.mycentraljersey.com/story/news/local/somerset-county/2015/09/28/fire-destroys-hillsborough-home/72973886/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/mycentraljersey.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The cause of a fire which destroyed a Hillsborough home  on Sunday afternoon is still under investigation.", "title": "Fire destroys Hillsborough home", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/b06adafd2f895de82947b9ef00b6b797cacc4852/c=357-0-1769-1412&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/09/28/NJGroup/Bridgewater/635790582709670021-fire.jpg", "creator": "@MyCentralJersey", "site": "@MyCentralJersey", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=859380356", "fb": {"app_id": 177893718898560}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": "Hillsborough"}, "article_summary": "Also responding were the Somerville Rescue Squad, Hillsborough Office of Emergency Management, PSE&G, the township Department of Public Works and the township Fire Safety Bureau.\nResponding to the fire were township police, all of the township volunteer fire departments, Hillsborough Rescue Squad and fire departments from Millstone Valley, Country Hills, Elizabeth Avenue and Montgomery.\nInvestigators are still trying to discover the cause of a fire which destroyed a Hillsborough home Sunday afternoon.\nHillsborough volunteer firefighter Lt.
