WALDEN, Colo. (AP) â€” A prescribed burn that jumped containment lines destroyed three structures and charred about 600 acres of grass.

No injuries were reported, but the fire burned a mobile home that was used for storage, a pump house and a barn.

The fire began Friday west of Cameron Pass near Walden.

The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service says crews started a prescribed burn on the Arapaho National Wildlife Refuge and it got out of control.

More than 30 firefighters and four aircraft were called in to fight the fire.
