Jeremy Siegel, Wharton School professor, shares his outlook on the markets as oil prices rebound and a dovish Fed put a lid on the strong dollar. If earnings rebound, market could hit new highs, predicts Siegel.

One bull sees some stability in the market as West Texas Intermediate crude traded above $41 Friday morning.

Jeremy Siegel, finance professor at the Wharton School, told CNBC's "Squawk Box" on Friday he feels much better about his bullish outlook given the recovery in oil prices.

"In January and early February there were two major negative forces on the market. One was the total collapse of oil prices down to $26," said Siegel "The second was a very real threat of a big devaluation from China."

"Those two deflationary forces which are very, very negative have dissipated," he said.
