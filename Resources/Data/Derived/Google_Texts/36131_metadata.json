The fed is back up and running and hundreds of thousands of non-essential furloughed government workers (a measly 17 percent of the massive Republic) are back on the non-essential job. Life is rough for them. They\u2019ve had to give up their two-week Netflix binges and will still get paid (some of them twice!) for their non-essential, non-work. Sigh.
