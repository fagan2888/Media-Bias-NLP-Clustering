At long last, one of Ted Cruz's Senate colleagues has agreed to endorse him for president.

The Texas senator and second-place Republican presidential candidate – who famously has few friends among what he frequently calls the "Washington cartel" – will get the formal backing of Sen. Mike Lee of Utah, a fellow tea party favorite and one of Cruz's few allies in the Senate.

Lee will formally endorse Cruz at a rally in Miami Thursday afternoon.

In 2013, Lee joined Cruz in his efforts to block the Affordable Care Act from being implemented, a move that led to 16-day government shutdown that helped make Cruz a hero among staunch conservatives but alienated him from most of his colleagues.

Initially, however, Lee declined to formally endorse Cruz or his other two Senate friends, Marco Rubio of Florida and Rand Paul of Kentucky, who threw in for the nomination.

"One of the weirdest things that can happen to a person is to have his three favorite co-workers all running for president of the United States at one time," Lee said in December. "It's just weird."

While Paul dropped out of the race early last month, Lee's decision to come out for Cruz is a major blow to Rubio, with whom Lee campaigned last month.
