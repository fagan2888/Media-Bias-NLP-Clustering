Representatives from several businesses at the expo said they have noticed an increase in customers looking to spend money on projects or products this year. They attributed to uptick to people being farther removed from the end of the Great Recession and from the implementation of Affordable Care Act, along with warmer temperatures in March than the previous year.\n\nKoeller, who has been in business since 1980, said he already has as many home remodeling or addition jobs as he had all of last year. Koeller said one of the most popular projects people are having done are new bathrooms, particularly high-end ones that include features like heated floors and can run up to $20,000.\n\n\"Jobs like roofing, siding and maintenance are going to be something you see every year, but people seem to be finally ready to get some of those other projects done they have been putting off,\" Koeller said.\n\nMike Bronsteatter, owner of ShamRock Lawn Care of Merrill, is taking part in his first expo and was pleased with the number of people who attended. He added that he expects to see a lot of yard maintenance work this year.\n\n\"It's nicer earlier in the year, so people are thinking about it,\" Bronsteatter said. \"I think there will be a lot of grass repair, landscaping, and some irrigation systems.\"\n\nLisa Rouse, who handles marketing for Greeneway RV Sales & Service of Wisconsin Rapids, said spending is also extending to areas of leisure. A display of various RVs by the business drew many attendees on Saturday.\n\nRouse said campers can run from around $17,000 to $20,000, and some of the most popular right now are destination trailers, which allow people to set up at a mobile campground. Rouse said that a popular amenity people are choosing to add when buying an RV is an outside kitchen, which typically adds an extra $400 to $500 to the cost of the RV.\n\n\"You can get where you are going then just open it up and you have a sink and a fridge right there. People who don't get one seem to go back,\" Rouse said. \"Campgrounds are doing a great job of having activities to offer families that bring them in, and people seem like they are more interested in buying now, which we're excited about.\"\n\nIf you go\n\nWhat: 17th annual Lawn, Garden, Home & Recreation Expo\n\nWhere: Central Wisconsin Convention and Expo Center, 10101 Market St., Rothschild\n\nWhen: 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. on Sunday\n\nCost: Free\n\nRead or Share this story: http://spjour.nl/1CkwsQo", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "17th annual Lawn, Garden, Home and Recreation Show attracts crowd looking at home projects", "og": {"site_name": "Stevens Point Journal Media", "description": "17th annual Lawn, Garden, Home and Recreation Show attracts crowd looking at home projects", "title": "Businesses at expo say they expect busy spring", "url": "http://www.stevenspointjournal.com/story/money/2015/03/28/businesses-expo-say-expect-busy-spring/70609204/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/stevenspointjournal.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "17th annual Lawn, Garden, Home and Recreation Show attracts crowd looking at home projects", "title": "Businesses at expo say they expect busy spring", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/dab110de8f479ee44c40dfe25f326b42ecc2566c/c=408-0-2856-2448&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/StevensPoint/2015/03/28/B9316720864Z.1_20150328184415_000_GRMABO45S.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@StevensPointJRL", "site": "@StevensPointJRL", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=884242174", "fb": {"app_id": 116784471723374}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070"}, "article_summary": "The 17th annual Lawn, Garden, Home & Recreation Expo was held this weekend at the Central Wisconsin Convention and Expo Center.\nNathan Vine/Stevens Point Journal MediaBuy Photo Lee Koeller, owner of Koeller Builds Plus, speaks with an attendee during the 17th annual Lawn, Garden, Home & Recreation Expo on Saturday at the Central Wisconsin Convention and Expo Center on Rothschild.\nIf you goWhat: 17th annual Lawn, Garden, Home & Recreation ExpoWhere: Central Wisconsin Convention and Expo Center, 10101 Market St., RothschildWhen: 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. on SundayCost: FreeRead or Share this story: http://spjour.nl/1CkwsQo\nRepresentatives from several businesses at the expo said they have noticed an increase in customers looking to spend money on projects or products this year.\nAs it was Koeller, owner of Koeller Builds Plus of Kronenwetter, is one of more than 80 vendors taking part in the event, now in its 17th year, this weekend at the Central Wisconsin Convention & Expo Center."}
