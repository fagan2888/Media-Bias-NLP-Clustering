LOS LUNAS, N.M. — The sweet aroma of roasted peppers is wafting throughout New Mexico, signaling that fall is around the corner and the green chile harvest is in full swing.

The annual ritual has everyone from Gov. Susana Martinez to farmers, chefs and hot-pepper aficionados professing their love for all things green chile. They’re quick to argue that the quality of New Mexico’s signature crop is unmatched.

The attention highlights a growing demand for the New Mexico-grown hot peppers, even as the number of acres planted and harvested each year has shrunk.

Labor costs, international competition and concerns over long-term water supplies — in a region that’s no stranger to drought — have worked against chile producers in the state.

“It’s really difficult for our farmers to compete cost-wise,” and that reality poses a threat to the state’s commercial chile industry, said Jaye Hawkins, executive director of the New Mexico Chile Association. “If we can’t compete, eventually, we’re going to lose it despite the demand.”

It has been years since salsa dethroned ketchup as the nation’s favorite condiment, and the use of peppers in the U.S. has been on an upward trajectory, now topping 2.3 billion pounds annually. New Mexico has a share of that market, supplying fresh and dried chilies to restaurants and major spice companies, but domestic supply hasn’t kept up with demand.

In the grip of a drought, most New Mexico farmers have been forced to rely on well water to irrigate their crops as flows in the Rio Grande have receded to record lows. With more pumping in the Hatch and Mesilla valleys, some farmers have seen their aquifers drop and the water grow more and more salty. And chile plants can be sensitive to the salt.

Still, experts say the shrinking of the industry can’t be blamed solely on drought.

Hawkins pointed to worker shortages, cheaper labor in Mexico and less restrictive environmental regulations in other countries as prohibitive factors.
