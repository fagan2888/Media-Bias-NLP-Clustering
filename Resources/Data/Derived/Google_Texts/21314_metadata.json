Today, the White House launched the \"ACA Bracket\" for people to vote on their favorite things about the Affordable Care Act, as symbolized by gifs. People vote using their Twitter or Facebook accounts to promote Obamacare.\n\nYes, that's right. The website of the White House, aka the house where one of the most powerful men in the world lives, is promoting a piece of legislation using cat gifs. This is real life.\n\nUnlike Warren Buffett's bracket contest, where a perfect bracket gets one billion dollars, there's really no winner in this bracket. Regardless of what gif wins, whether it be \"girl falling while trying to twerk on a bathroom sink\" or \"Elmo flings himself off of a store shelf,\" Americans are stuck with a crappy, unpopular law that's causing premiums to rise and canceling millions of people's health plans. Awesome.\n\nBut that Elmo gif sure is funny.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The government is using cat gifs to promote Obamacare. .05/24/2016 2:54:41AM EST.", "author": "Christine Rousselle", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "The government is using cat gifs to promote Obamacare.", "title": "Christine Rousselle - White House Launches \"ACA Bracket\" for March Madness", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/christinerousselle/2014/03/17/white-house-launches-aca-bracket-for-march-madness-n1810384", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/uploads/2014/3/17/15.png", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "The government is using cat gifs to promote Obamacare.", "title": "Christine Rousselle - White House Launches \"ACA Bracket\" for March Madness", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/christinerousselle/2014/03/17/white-house-launches-aca-bracket-for-march-madness-n1810384", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/uploads/2014/3/17/15.png", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "White House Launches \"ACA Bracket\" for March Madness, Christine Rousselle, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd93b6\"", "article_summary": "Today, the White House launched the \"ACA Bracket\" for people to vote on their favorite things about the Affordable Care Act, as symbolized by gifs.\nUnlike Warren Buffett's bracket contest, where a perfect bracket gets one billion dollars, there's really no winner in this bracket.\nThe website of the White House, aka the house where one of the most powerful men in the world lives, is promoting a piece of legislation using cat gifs.\nPeople vote using their Twitter or Facebook accounts to promote Obamacare.\nBut that Elmo gif sure is funny."}
