(NASDAQ: BNFT), a leading provider of cloud-based benefits software solutions, today announced that Southeastern Freight Lines (Southeastern) has selected Benefitfocus HR INTOUCH MARKETPLACE\u00ae to support benefit enrollment and employee communication as well as to facilitate compliance with the Affordable Care Act (ACA). Headquartered in Lexington, SC, Southeastern is one of the largest less-than-truckload (LTL) carriers in the nation with more than 7,400 employees, of which nearly half are drivers. Available from any web-enabled device, the cloud-based HR INTOUCH MARKETPLACE portal will allow Southeastern to begin offering their workforce convenient, 24/7 access to their benefits information this summer.\n\nHR INTOUCH MARKETPLACE provides an intuitive user interface with decision support features and educational videos that guide employees through the enrollment workflow, facilitating Southeastern's transition from a paper-based passive enrollment process to an active open enrollment online. The BENEFITFOCUS\u00ae Plan Shopping App personalizes the benefits selection process by allowing employees to compare coverage details and estimate out-of-pocket costs so they can identify which plan best suits their healthcare and financial needs.\n\n\"We are updating our employee benefits program, and we believe Benefitfocus will help us implement any changes successfully,\" said Alvin Shaver, Director of Compensation & Benefits at Southeastern Freight Lines. \"Not only is HR InTouch Marketplace a solution that can simplify the complexity associated with ACA compliance, it's the solution we need to enhance employee communication and benefits education during this time of transition. The user-friendly software that Benefitfocus provides is a great place for our company to start, and we are confident that it will be essential to supporting our growth.\"\n\nBuilt on a rules-based engine, HR INTOUCH MARKETPLACE allows Southeastern to configure the enrollment workflow so employees are presented with all the plan options for which they are eligible. Acknowledgement forms and declination surveys can be incorporated within the enrollment workflow to confirm employee review of ACA-mandated communications such as the notification for public exchanges and the Summary of Benefits & Coverage. The portal provides Southeastern with the ability to report on this information in the event of an audit as well as the ability to drill down to review summaries of plan participation and employee enrollment status.\n\n\"Southeastern has achieved a reputation of delivering the highest quality of service in their industry as a result of their employees' commitment to service and their passion for excellence,\" stated Shawn Jenkins, Benefitfocus President & CEO. \"At Benefitfocus, we are dedicated to achieving that high level of quality when it comes to designing technology that delivers an engaging and streamlined enrollment experience. We are excited to provide the software and service to make the transition to online enrollment seamless and simple for Southeastern and its employees.\"\n\nBenefitfocus will introduce new developments to its cloud-based software solutions during its annual conference, One Place. 2014.
