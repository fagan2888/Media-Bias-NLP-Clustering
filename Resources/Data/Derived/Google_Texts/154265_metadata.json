They\u2019ve begun departing from the GOP stance on issues like energy and climate change \u2014 a move that lets them espouse independence back home, but also exposes divisions that are bound to intensify as 2016 draws nearer.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThe Senate\u2019s dynamic was on display in a series of amendment votes over the last week on the Keystone XL oil pipeline: New Hampshire Sen. Kelly Ayotte, one of the Democrats\u2019 top targets in 2016, repeatedly broke with her party, including by opposing efforts to hamper Obama\u2019s international climate negotiations. Illinois Sen. Mark Kirk was the lone Republican to back regulations on petroleum coke, a byproduct from oil refining. And conservative Pennsylvania Sen. Pat Toomey was one of 15 Republicans to endorse a statement that humans contribute to climate change.\n\nAnother defector, North Carolina Sen. Richard Burr, was the only Republican to vote for a Democrat-backed mandate that the pipeline be built with U.S. steel. \u201cIt\u2019s real simple,\u201d he said proudly. \u201cI\u2019ve been for \u2018Buy America\u2019 every time it\u2019s come up in the Senate.\u201d\n\nDemocrats lost most of those amendment battles, and the Senate is expected to eventually pass the pro-Keystone bill with support from all of the chamber\u2019s 54 Republicans. The pipeline also has Democratic supporters such as Colorado Sen. Michael Bennet \u2014 himself vulnerable in 2016 \u2014 who opposed a Democrat-led filibuster that stalled the measure Monday night.\n\nBut the early test on Keystone shows one of the major juggling acts McConnell must handle as he begins to chart an aggressive course for his majority, with more tough votes looming on the budget, taxes, trade and foreign policy.\n\nIf McConnell goes too far to the right, he could lose swing-state GOP senators who need to moderate on issues that resonate in their backyards, especially during a presidential election year that\u2019s expected to bring a surge of Democratic turnout. But if McConnell tries to move to the center on issues that play well in Ohio or Wisconsin \u2014 where GOP Sens. Rob Portman and Ron Johnson face reelection, respectively \u2014 he could have a hard time reconciling the Senate\u2019s legislation with what comes out of the conservative House.\n\nOne bright spot: The defections will help GOP senators rebut Democratic accusations that they\u2019re mere foot soldiers for their party\u2019s leaders in an unpopular Congress. Republican leaders hope their endangered senators will defect on less controversial issues but ultimately fall in line for the bulk of the party\u2019s agenda, starting with Keystone and continuing into this spring\u2019s budget fight.\n\n\u201cNot everyone is going to vote like a red-state senator from Texas,\u201d said Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas), the chief vote-counter for his conference. \u201cThat\u2019s just part of our diversity and regional differences. But I\u2019d say we\u2019re pretty darn unified and making good progress.\u201d\n\nIndeed, the Senate GOP Conference\u2019s ideological spectrum includes a conservative wing marked by the likes of Ted Cruz of Texas and freshman James Lankford of Oklahoma, along with a handful of moderates like Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska. In the middle is McConnell, who has 54 votes if he can keep his caucus united, six shy of breaking a Democratic filibuster and 13 short of overriding a veto.\n\nWhat makes this class of Republican senators particularly vulnerable is the expectation that they will be running in a far different climate in 2016. When they won their elections in 2010, the political environment heavily favored Republicans, as the rise of the tea party and fears over Obamacare drove GOP turnout in the midterm elections. But with the presidential race driving a larger number of voters in 2016, and Democrats hopeful that Hillary Clinton will draw women to the polls, Republicans could face a daunting path to holding the majority. The GOP has 24 Senate seats in contention, compared with the Democrats\u2019 10.\n\nThe dynamics put blue-state Republicans like Kirk in a tricky spot. To pull off a victory, the former 10-year House veteran will have to show he can work with Democrats and espouse moderate credentials, without leaving himself vulnerable to a primary challenge.\n\nSo far this year, he has balked at his party\u2019s efforts to derail Obama\u2019s executive actions on immigration through the Homeland Security spending bill. He joined Democrats on a number of early votes, including siding with fellow Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin in favor of regulating petroleum coke, an issue of importance on Chicago\u2019s South Side. And he broke with Republicans by backing an amendment offered by his close friend, West Virginia Democrat Joe Manchin, calling on the Senate to invest in so-called clean coal technology.\n\nIn an interview, Manchin indicated he may endorse Kirk\u2019s reelection bid. \u201cHe\u2019s my friend, and I will do whatever my friend thinks I could do to help him,\u201d Manchin said.\n\nWhile allowing Republican senators to showcase their independence, the uptick in action on politically charged amendments also puts them at risk for seeing their votes turned into 30-second attack ads.\n\nBlue-state Republicans are also bound to face attacks if they vote against populist-tinged issues \u2014 such as when the GOP united to block an amendment by Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.) that would have required Keystone\u2019s oil to be used in the U.S.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s clear there are any number of Republican senators who will be spending lots of time desperately trying to distort their irresponsible records,\u201d said Justin Barasky, spokesman for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee.\n\nThe politically charged nature of Senate debate was a big reason why now-Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) shielded vulnerable Democrats from sensitive votes in the last Congress. A number of Democrats privately argued that casting politically toxic votes on issues like Obamacare and taxes could hurt their reelection efforts. But others, like former Sen. Mark Begich of Alaska, who lost his reelection bid last fall, said having more votes would have allowed red-state Democrats to distinguish themselves from an unpopular White House.\n\nIn the new Senate, McConnell\u2019s caucus appears to be taking Begich\u2019s advice.\n\nAyotte, who won her 2010 Senate primary with an endorsement from Sarah Palin, cast a series of votes in the opening month of the new Congress that broke sharply from her caucus. The former New Hampshire attorney general opposed a Toomey proposal that would have exempted power plants that burn waste coal from certain federal emission limits. She opposed an effort by Utah Sen. Mike Lee to make it easier to drill for oil and gas on public lands. And she opposed a proposal by a member of her party\u2019s leadership, Missouri Sen. Roy Blunt, to hamstring international climate agreements reached by the Obama administration, including a recent pact with China.\n\nAyotte spokeswoman Liz Johnson said the senator\u2019s votes \u201care consistent\u201d with her \u201clong record\u201d of \u201cstanding up for clean air and crossing party lines to protect New Hampshire\u2019s environment.\u201d\n\nOther GOP defections took Senate insiders by surprise, particularly on climate change. In a vote last week, 15 Republicans joined with Democrats to state that climate change is \u201creal\u201d and that human activity \u201ccontributes\u201d to the phenomenon. In that group were a number of Republicans facing voters in 2016, including Ayotte, Kirk, Portman, Murkowski and Sens. John McCain of Arizona and Rand Paul of Kentucky \u2014 along with Toomey.\n\nThe Pennsylvania Republican, who narrowly won his first term in 2010 on the strength of his staunch conservative fiscal record, isn\u2019t a recent convert on the science of global warming, his spokeswoman said.\n\n\u201cSen. Toomey has always said that human activity contributes to climate change,\u201d said his spokeswoman, Elizabeth Anderson. \u201cThe degree to which we play a role is clearly up for debate.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "2016 electoral map complicates life for new Senate majority.", "title": "Swing-state Republicans break ranks", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/01/moderate-republicans-mitch-mcconnell-senate-114620.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2015/01/26/150126_mitch_mcconnell_1_ap_1160.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Senate Republicans,Congress,Mark Kirk,North Carolina,2016 Elections,GOP,Campaigns,Pennsylvania,Elections,Kelly Ayotte,Senate,Pat Toomey,Ron Johnson,Republicans,Climate Change,Rob Portman,Mitch McConnell,Illinois,New Hampshire,Ohio,Richard Burr,Keystone XL,Wisconsin", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "2016 electoral map complicates life for new Senate majority.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "It didn\u2019t take long for vulnerable Republican senators to start bucking their new majority\u2019s party line.\nOne bright spot: The defections will help GOP senators rebut Democratic accusations that they\u2019re mere foot soldiers for their party\u2019s leaders in an unpopular Congress.\nAnd conservative Pennsylvania Sen.
