Copy may not be in its final form.\n\nJUAN GONZ\u00c1LEZ: President Obama became the first sitting president in history to visit a federal prison Thursday when he toured the El Reno Federal Correctional Institution in Oklahoma. After passing through several security gates, Obama stepped inside a 9-by-10-foot cell and walked through a section called Cell Block B that houses prisoners who are part of a drug rehabilitation and prevention program. He also spent about 45 minutes meeting with six nonviolent drug offenders, which he described during a press conference afterward.\n\nPRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: Visiting with these six individuals, and I\u2019ve said this before, when they describe their youth and their childhood, these are\u2014these are young people who made mistakes that aren\u2019t that different than the mistakes I made and the mistakes that a lot of you guys made. The difference is, they did not have the kinds of support structures, the second chances, the resources that would allow them to survive those mistakes.\n\nAnd, you know, I think we have a tendency sometimes to almost take for granted or think it\u2019s normal that so many young people end up in our criminal justice system. It\u2019s not normal. It\u2019s not what happens in other countries. What is normal is teenagers doing stupid things. What is normal is young people making mistakes. And we\u2019ve got to be able to distinguish between dangerous individuals who need to be incapacitated and incarcerated versus young people who are in an environment in which they are adapting, but if given different opportunities, a different vision of life, could be thriving the way we are. That\u2019s what strikes me. There but for the grace of God. And that, I think, is something that we all have to think about.\n\n\n\nofficial MintPress sponsor official MintPress sponsor\n\nJUAN GONZ\u00c1LEZ: Obama\u2019s stop at the federal prison in El Reno comes amidst a broad, bipartisan push to end mass incarceration.
