The prolific filmmaker\u2019s newest movie, \u201cMagic in the Moonlight,\u201d has already received several less-than-positive reviews, but critical opinion doesn\u2019t seem to weigh too heavily on Allen \u2014 or, in his view, on the public, according to a recent interview with the New York Times. In the midst of shooting his latest project, Allen told the Times that \u201cnothing keeps [audiences] away if they think they\u2019ll enjoy\u201d one of his films.\n\nThat includes deterrents like lingering public outrage over the allegations of sexual abuse Allen encountered earlier this year, when his former stepdaughter Dylan Farrow publicly accused the filmmaker of molesting her as a child. In Allen\u2019s view, and in the view of his sister and longtime producer Letty Aronson, such allegations have little to do with whether people will turn out to see his movies:\n\n\u201cNo thoughts like that occur to me,\u201d he said to this reporter. \u201cThey only occur to you guys.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone has ever not come to a film of mine that they thought they would enjoy,\u201d he added. \u201cNothing keeps them away if they think they\u2019ll enjoy the film. And if they don\u2019t think they\u2019ll enjoy the film, nothing we can do ever brings them in.\u201d Ms. Aronson agreed it would be \u201csheer stupidity\u201d for Mr. Allen\u2019s fans to avoid his future films. \u201cIf they like Woody Allen movies, what are they doing?\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re not hurting him. They\u2019re hurting themselves.\u201d Asked if the recent scrutiny weighed on Mr. Allen, Ms. Aronson said: \u201cNo, not at all. And I think this year\u2019s rehashing of everything made everything so much more obvious.\u201d Whatever people want to believe about Mr. Allen, \u201cthere\u2019s nothing you can do,\u201d she said. \u201cYou just move on and go on with your life, which is what he\u2019s done.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "In Allen's world, sexual abuse charges won't have anything to do with poor attendance at his newest film", "author": "Jenny Kutner", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "In Allen's world, sexual abuse charges won't have anything to do with poor attendance at his newest film", "title": "Woody Allen: \u201cNothing keeps people away if they think they\u2019ll enjoy my films\u201d", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/07/20/woody_allen_nothing_keeps_people_away_if_they_think_theyll_enjoy_my_films/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/02/woody_allen.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "In Allen's world, sexual abuse charges won't have anything to do with poor attendance at his newest film", "creator": "@@JennyKutner", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/02/woody_allen.jpg", "title": "Woody Allen: \u201cNothing keeps people away if they think they\u2019ll enjoy my films\u201d", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Woody Allen: \u201cNothing keeps people away if they think they\u2019ll enjoy my films\u201d", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Dylan Farrow, Film, letty aronson, Movies, New York Times, Sexual abuse, Woody Allen", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477afa6914bd0286fe6491\"", "article_summary": "Topics: Dylan Farrow, Film, letty aronson, Movies, New York Times, Sexual abuse, Woody Allen, Entertainment News, NewsNothing can stop Woody Allen, according to Woody Allen.\nIn the midst of shooting his latest project, Allen told the Times that \u201cnothing keeps [audiences] away if they think they\u2019ll enjoy\u201d one of his films.\n\u201cNothing keeps them away if they think they\u2019ll enjoy the film.\n\u201cIf they like Woody Allen movies, what are they doing?\u201d she said.\nThey\u2019re hurting themselves.\u201d Asked if the recent scrutiny weighed on Mr. Allen, Ms. Aronson said: \u201cNo, not at all."}
