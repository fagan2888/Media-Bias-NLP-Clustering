And when the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) abandoned the operation to avoid a bloody shootout, they declared victory.\n\nGovernment officials promised accountability for those who broke the law by taking up arms against federal agents. It seems unfathomable, in fact, that the U.S. Department of Justice would allow a mob of antigovernment zealots to get away with using the threat of violence to block the enforcement of the law.\n\nBut, as the months have dragged on, there has been no response. Not an arrest. Not an indictment. Nothing.\n\nSpeaking with National Public Radio a month after the standoff, BLM Director Neil Kornze promised the agency would work through the legal system. \u201cI can\u2019t say a lot because there\u2019s an active investigation going on, but we are working hard to ensure that those who did break the law are held accountable,\u201d Kornze said.\n\nThe Clark County, Nevada, Sheriff\u2019s Department has said an investigation is under way, as has the FBI. But as that investigation drags on, militias have turned the Bundy family ranch into an armed compound ready for a ground war with the Feds, and Bundy has gone on the lecture circuit to claim victory against the government.\n\nJust last month, speaking at a gathering billed as \u201cAn Evening with Cliven Bundy\u201d in Nevada, the embattled rancher, now a hero to the radical right, again reiterated his defiance and disdain for the federal government.\n\n\u201cI was really surprised that they would go this far to put their guns down we the people\u2019s throat and try to show the public, the world, the federal government has unlimited power over we the people of the state of Nevada. That isn\u2019t right, and that\u2019s not ever going to happen again in America or in the state of Nevada,\u201d a television station quoted Bundy saying.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Six months after the standoff in Nevada, officials have failed to issue either an arrest or an indictment", "title": "The federal government lost its war against Cliven Bundy", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Six months after the standoff in Nevada, officials have failed to issue either an arrest or an indictment", "title": "The federal government lost its war against Cliven Bundy", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/10/19/the_federal_government_lost_its_war_against_cliven_bundy_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/04/cliven_bundy1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Six months after the standoff in Nevada, officials have failed to issue either an arrest or an indictment", "title": "The federal government lost its war against Cliven Bundy", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/04/cliven_bundy1.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Ryan Lenz", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, cliven bundy, Nevada, Southern Poverty Law Center", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb804\"", "article_summary": "Topics: cliven bundy, Nevada, Southern Poverty Law Center, News, Politics NewsThis article was originally published by The Southern Poverty Law CenterIt has been six months since the federal government called off its attempt to round up cattle belonging to Nevada rancher Cliven Bundy amid a tense standoff with heavily armed militiamen who trained their weapons on federal agents.\nJust last month, speaking at a gathering billed as \u201cAn Evening with Cliven Bundy\u201d in Nevada, the embattled rancher, now a hero to the radical right, again reiterated his defiance and disdain for the federal government.\nThat isn\u2019t right, and that\u2019s not ever going to happen again in America or in the state of Nevada,\u201d a television station quoted Bundy saying.\nGovernment officials promised accountability for those who broke the law by taking up arms against federal agents.\nAnd when the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) abandoned the operation to avoid a bloody shootout, they declared victory."}
