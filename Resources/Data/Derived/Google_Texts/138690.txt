Fire crews battled a two-alarm fire at a Hutchinson business on Friday around 9:15 p.m.

Firefighters were called to the report of an explosion and fire at 211 W. 5th Avenue. The building houses two businesses, Midwest Sewing & Vacuum and Nelson Heating & Air.

When crews arrived, an explosion occurred that blew out the glass on building's windows. Heavy fire then continued and a second alarm was called.

It took crews two hours to get the fire under control.

There were no reports of injuries.

Investigators from the Office of the State Fire Marshall are on scene to determine the cause of the fire.
