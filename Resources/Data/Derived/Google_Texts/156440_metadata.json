Athletic department officials are urging fans to arrive earlier than usual because of the potential backups in entering the stadium.\n\nThis is CSU\u2019s first sellout since Oct. 22, 2004. That day, the crowd was 30,108 in the then-30,000-seat stadium. The Rams beat Wyoming 30-7. CSU\u2019s most recent home crowd of 30,000-plus was 30,027 against Boise State on Oct. 15, 2011. Also, CSU said this was only the second advance sellout in school history, after the Sept. 14, 2002 game against Louisville that drew 31,607.\n\nUPDATE: Man, they weren\u2019t kidding. There were pockets of stop and go from Longmont on up, but since Northern Colorado traffic has become Houston North, that wasn\u2019t surprising. I came across Prospect to access the north gate for the press parking \u2026 and crawled (if that) from Shields on. And this was over two hours before the game.\n\nI know this is completely useless to anyone who anyone who isn\u2019t coming to the game, but perhaps you\u2019re coming to the game and can read this because someone else is driving OR YOU\u2019RE STOPPED IN TRAFFIC.\n\nSee you at the stadium.\n\nTHIRD QUARTER: The official crowd count is 32,546.\n\nTerry Frei: tfrei@denverpost or twitter.com/TFrei", "article_metadata": {"Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "language": "en, sv", "og": {"site_name": "The Field House", "description": "Colorado State vs. Utah State is a sellout", "title": "Colorado State vs. Utah State (32,546) is Rams' first sellout in 10 years", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/colleges/2014/10/18/colorado-state-vs-utah-state-sellout/31951/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/colleges/files/2014/10/USU530p-495x369.jpg", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "Colorado State vs. Utah State is a sellout", "title": "Colorado State vs. Utah State (32,546) is Rams\u2019 first sellout in 10 years", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/colleges/2014/10/18/colorado-state-vs-utah-state-sellout/31951/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/colleges/files/2014/10/USU530p-495x369.jpg", "creator": "@TFrei", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "follow, all", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Colorado State,Football,sellout,Utah State"}, "article_summary": "AFTERNOON: The word has come down from Fort Collins: The Colorado State vs. Utah State game at 5 p.m. is a sellout.\nThis is CSU\u2019s first sellout since Oct. 22, 2004.\nCSU\u2019s most recent home crowd of 30,000-plus was 30,027 against Boise State on Oct. 15, 2011.\nAthletic department officials are urging fans to arrive earlier than usual because of the potential backups in entering the stadium.\nThere were pockets of stop and go from Longmont on up, but since Northern Colorado traffic has become Houston North, that wasn\u2019t surprising."}
