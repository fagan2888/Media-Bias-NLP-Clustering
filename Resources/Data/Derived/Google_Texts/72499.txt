The Colorado Department of Corrections is investigating the death of a murder at Limon Correctional Facility

The Colorado Bureau of Investigation is investigating the death on Thursday of a 25-year-old inmate who was being held at a high-security state prison in Limon.

Joshua Edmonds was serving a 15-year prison sentence for burglary with explosives or a weapon when his body was discovered.

Agents with the Inspector General's Office are also investigating the circumstances of Edmonds' death.

Adrienne Jacobson, a spokeswoman for the Colorado Department of Corrections, said she does not know the circumstances of Edmonds' death.

Colorado Springs police arrested Edmonds in April of 2010 and he was originally charged with 11 felony counts including weapons, burglary and assault. He entered a plea bargain in which 10 of the charges were dismissed in exchange for his guilty plea to first degree burglary.

Burglars are typically not sent to Limon, which houses some of Colorado's most dangerous criminals including killers and gang leaders.

"He would have had to earn his way into Limon," Jacobson said.
