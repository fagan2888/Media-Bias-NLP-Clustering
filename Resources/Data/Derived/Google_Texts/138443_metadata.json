Wade is the law of the land\n\nposted at 7:21 pm on August 20, 2015 by Allahpundit\n\nVia the Weekly Standard and the Federalist, lots of buzz among social conservatives about this exchange yesterday afternoon. The soundbite in isolation isn\u2019t dramatic \u2014 Roe is, tragically, the law of the land and we do live with it \u2014 but the context makes it more ominous. A libertarian stood up at a town hall and told him point blank that he\u2019s looking for a president who\u2019s a fiscal conservative and who\u2019s also \u201cnot a threat to a woman\u2019s right to control her own body.\u201d Translation: You won\u2019t come after Roe, will you? To which Kasich replied, hey, it\u2019s the law of the land and we live with it. Gulp. Meanwhile, when CNN asked him about abortion four days ago, he dismissed their questions by insisting that the GOP spends \u201ctoo much\u201d time on the issue when there are other important problems like infant mortality and the environment to focus on. He said this, mind you, at a moment when the Planned Parenthood sting videos are consuming conservative media. Second look at Jeb?\n\nDepending upon how well disposed you are to Kasich (which probably isn\u2019t much, given his role as the Huntsman in the 2016 race), you could view this as a case of a guy who\u2019s actually solidly pro-life trying to weasel out of a tough question from a pro-choicer. He doesn\u2019t reassure the questioner, after all, that he\u2019d leave Roe alone; all he says is that we\u2019re living with it, which is a pretty vacant statement of intention. In fact, when reporters cornered him afterward, he revised what he said this way:\n\nAfter the town hall meeting, Kasich told reporters he had signed abortion restrictions in Ohio. \u201cIt\u2019s the law of the land until it changes,\u201d he said.\n\nHe has indeed signed abortion restrictions as governor. Per the Standard, \u201cKasich has overseen a drop in his state\u2019s abortion rate to all-time lows, signing into law a budget that defunded Planned Parenthood in his state and a ban on abortions performed after the fetus can be viable outside the womb.\u201d That\u2019s encouraging even though yesterday\u2019s soundbite isn\u2019t. So how damning this is depends, really, on your own personal reading of the Kasich tea leaves. Is Sean Davis right that this amounts to Kasich signaling a Mitch Daniels-esque \u201ctruce\u201d with Democrats on social issues once he\u2019s elected president? Or, in his attempt to consolidate moderates, is he actually trying to disguise the fact that he\u2019d firmly oppose abortion as president so that the centrist voters he needs right now don\u2019t get cold feet? You tell me.\n\nExit quotation via Davis: \u201cKasich tells Obamacare opponents they\u2019re going to hell, but won\u2019t tell an abortion supporter that he thinks Roe v. Wade was wrong.\u201d\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "Uh oh.", "title": "Kasich: We live with the fact that Roe v.
