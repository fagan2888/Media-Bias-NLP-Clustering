The previous 10 innings, a fan\u2019s delight and a manager\u2019s nightmare, fell into the background. And Rafael Soriano, who blew his fifth save and left the field to a chorus of boos, was absolved of his disastrous outing.\n\nWerth hit a leadoff double in the 11th inning and scored on Hairston\u2019s sacrifice fly to give the Nationals a 6-5 victory over the Pirates. The game began as a pitcher\u2019s duel, morphed into a comedy of errors and featured two blown saves. But it ended with Washington\u2019s sixth straight win and a second consecutive sweep.\n\n\u201cLast-minute, last-inning comeback and winning the game on a walk-off hit? Those are all good things,\u201d manager Matt Williams said. \u201cNot a whole lot of fun in the dugout, but we\u2019ll take it. We\u2019re not giving that one back.\u201d\n\nWith the win, the Nationals moved 6 games ahead of the Atlanta Braves in the National League East. They also welcomed back Werth, who had missed seven games with a right shoulder injury.\n\nWerth warmed up before the game but was told by Williams that he would not be needed. When the game was tied up, he returned to the batting cage and took a few more swings. He told Williams that he was good to go, and in the ninth inning, Williams decided to use him.\n\nWerth drew a one-out walk, advanced to third base on a single by Denard Span and scored on another single by Asdrubal Cabrera, knotting the game at 5. He then played right field and returned to the plate in the 11th, when he doubled over Gregory Polanco\u2019s head in left field to spark the final push.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot at stake here this season,\u201d Werth said, \u201cand I want to be a part of it.\u201d\n\nBefore all of that, the game went from tame to wacky in a hurry. After Doug Fister spun four hitless innings, two Pirates reached base on errors by Ian Desmond and Anthony Rendon in the sixth. A third was safe at first when Rendon\u2019s throw hit him in the back.\n\nIn one of his most impressive innings of the season, Fister induced a pair of grounders that led to force plays at the plate. With a fly ball to right field, he wiggled out of the inning.\n\n\u201cThat inning could\u2019ve blown up, and he didn\u2019t allow that,\u201d Williams said. \u201cThat\u2019s a key moment in the game.\u201d\n\nIn the seventh, it was Pittsburgh\u2019s turn to make a few mistakes. With the bases loaded and nobody out, Cabrera hit a slow bouncer to first base, where Ike Davis collected the ball and tried to throw out Taylor at home. But his throw bounced off catcher Russell Martin\u2019s mitt and rolled down the third-base line. Taylor touched home and Kevin Frandsen, realizing that the Pirates could not get to the ball in time, rounded third, slid headfirst into home and pulled the Nationals ahead.\n\nIn the following at-bat, another grounder turned into a high throw at the plate, allowing Span to slide under Martin\u2019s feet for another run. After a spotless eighth inning by Tyler Clippard, Soriano jogged to the mound in the ninth in search of his 30th save.\n\nBut he, like so many players Sunday night, made an uncharacteristic error, hitting Starling Marte in the back to lead off the inning. A single, a walk, a wild pitch, a fielder\u2019s choice and a bases-clearing double followed, forcing Williams to remove his closer from the game. Soriano left the field to boos, then Matt Thornton pitched his way out of the inning.\n\n\u201cI think the fans here not be the same fans in New York, because I play two years in New York and it be more loud that that,\u201d Soriano said. \u201cI no do my job. What I have to say? Nothing.\u201d\n\nOn this night, however, Soriano was absolved. Ross Detwiler threw two steady innings, Washington\u2019s confidence never wavered and Werth returned in style. A wacky evening ended with a mob near the first-base dugout, and Gatorade dripping from Hairston\u2019s jersey after a celebratory bath.\n\n\u201cI think today was a tribute to just the team mentality in general,\u201d Fister said. \u201cThat\u2019s a lesson learned for us, knowing that if something goes wrong, there\u2019s 24 guys right behind you to pick you up. Whether it\u2019s offense, whether it\u2019s defense, guys are playing well together.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Washington's second walk-off win in as many nights, a 6-5 victory over the Pittsburgh Pirates, allowed the Nationals to sweep their second consecutive series and expand their division lead over the Braves.", "Author": "Tom Schad", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Washington\u2019s second walk-off win in as many nights, a 6-5 victory over the Pittsburgh Pirates, allowed the Nationals to sweep their second consecutive series and expand their division lead over the Braves.", "title": "Nationals walk off with another win in wacky 11-inning affair", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/aug/17/nationals-walk-another-win-wacky-11-inning-affair/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/08/17/pirates-nationals-bas_lanc3.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/08/17/pirates-nationals-bas_lanc3.jpg", "title": "Nationals walk off with another win in wacky 11-inning affair", "description": "Washington's second walk-off win in as many nights, a 6-5 victory over the Pittsburgh Pirates, allowed the Nationals to sweep their second consecutive series and expand their division lead over the Br", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "news_keywords": "Sports, Jayson Werth, Rafael Soriano, Pittsburgh Pirates, Matt Williams"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc611\"", "article_summary": "He told Williams that he was good to go, and in the ninth inning, Williams decided to use him.\nWe\u2019re not giving that one back.\u201dWith the win, the Nationals moved 6 games ahead of the Atlanta Braves in the National League East.\nWhen Werth touched the plate, cementing Washington\u2019s second walk-off win in as many nights against the Pittsburgh Pirates, the earlier errors were forgotten.\nWith a fly ball to right field, he wiggled out of the inning.\nWerth hit a leadoff double in the 11th inning and scored on Hairston\u2019s sacrifice fly to give the Nationals a 6-5 victory over the Pirates."}
