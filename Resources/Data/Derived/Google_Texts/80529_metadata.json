On Monday, the whole issue came full circle when two of the people behind the videos used to smear Planned Parenthood were criminally indicted by a Republican prosecutor in Texas.\n\nOn Monday night, Planned Parenthood CEO and all-around goddess Cecile Richards appeared on MSNBC\u2019s All In with Chris Hayes to perform a windswept victory dance on the grave of this fiasco, while reminding everyone how important it is to fight against the dangerous lies being told about women and their health care:\n\nPlease enable Javascript to watch.\n\n\u201cWell, look, all of these videos have been thoroughly discredited. As we saw today in Houston, the perpetrators have been indicted. Words have meaning. People should think long and hard when they stigmatize women, health care providers, doctors. There\u2019s nothing more tragic than what happened in Colorado Springs. It\u2019s important that all women access health care in this country safely and without fear. That\u2019s what we\u2019re about at Planned Parenthood.\u201d\n\nThat inhospitable environment is an excellent illustration of Cecile Richards\u2019 importance to women\u2019s rights, because she faces punishing conditions like that every day, but her toughness powers through it effortlessly, and without fanfare. This interview would have tempted most high-profile activists to launch into showy windmill punches and fancy rhetorical footwork, but Cecile kept it pitch-perfect, and all about the women she\u2019s trying to protect.\n\nMuch has been made of Hillary Clinton\u2019s testimony before Congress, but Cecile Richards faced down an equally hostile committee with exactly this grace and aplomb. Nothing can really compare to Cecile\u2019s response when Rep. Jason Chaffetz tried to roll over her with some bullshitty chart:\n\n\u201cMy lawyer is informing me the source of this is from Americans for Life, which is an anti-abortion group. So I would check your source.\u201d\n\nRichards\u2019 toughness is, of course, tinged with the knowledge that there will probably never be a final victory against opponents of abortion rights, and that she will be standing in that wind for very long time.", "article_metadata": {"description": "On Monday night, Planned Parenthood CEO and all-around goddess Cecile Richards appeared on MSNBC's All In with Chris Hayes to perform a windswept victory dance", "generator": "WordPress 2016.21", "og": {"image": "http://static01.mediaite.com/med/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/cecile-e1453820180110-1.jpg", "title": "Cecile Richards Dances All Over Planned Parenthood Video Scammers"}, "twitter": {"description": "On Monday night, Planned Parenthood CEO and all-around goddess Cecile Richards appeared on MSNBC's All In with Chris Hayes to perform a windswept victory dance on the grave of this fiasco, while reminding everyone how important it is to fight against the dangerous lies being told about women and their health care.", "title": "Cecile Richards Dances All Over Planned Parenthood Video Scammers", "image": "http://static01.mediaite.com/med/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/cecile-e1453820180110-1.jpg", "creator": "@TommyXtopher", "site": "@mediaite", "card": "summary"}, "NextGEN": "1.5.5", "date": "2016-01-26T12:27:43+00:00", "keywords": "columnists,online,opinion,print,tv", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.5, minimum-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Much has been made of Hillary Clinton\u2019s testimony before Congress, but Cecile Richards faced down an equally hostile committee with exactly this grace and aplomb.\nFor months now, various state investigations have been clearing Planned Parenthood of any wrongdoing over the allegations surrounding fetal tissue donation, allegations which have been loudly and falsely been spread by Republican politicians.\nOn Monday, the whole issue came full circle when two of the people behind the videos used to smear Planned Parenthood were criminally indicted by a Republican prosecutor in Texas.\nPeople should think long and hard when they stigmatize women, health care providers, doctors.\nIt\u2019s important that all women access health care in this country safely and without fear."}
