The school also tells students not to wear any costume that \u201ctrivializes human suffering, oppression, and marginalization,\u201d such as costumes of prisoners, the mentally ill, or disabled people.\n\nStudents who are unsure about whether their costume is offensive are encourage to contact a collection of Wesleyan departments, such as the Office of Equity and Inclusion.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t take long to think of many costumes that are potentially off-limits from such advice. A \u201cmad scientist\u201d get-up could be seen as offending the mentally ill, as was recently seen when a dormitory at Harvey Mudd College was attacked for hosting a mad-scientist themed party. Fans of Orange is the New Black (a prison comedy) can\u2019t dress up as a favorite character, and country-specific get-ups such as Canadian lumberjacks or Japanese geisha are quite off-limits as well.\n\nBut Wesleyan\u2019s advice may simply be prudent, since every year sees new controversies caused by student costumes that offend one group or another. Last year the University of Chicago saw complaints after some students dressed as stereotypical Mexicans, and in 2013 Washington University in St. Louis had an outcry after photos surfaced of students dressed as soldiers pointing \u201cguns\u201d at a person in Middle Eastern garb. With an unwanted scandal just one costume away, Wesleyan is likely eager to do what it can to avoid unwanted problems, especially given the recent backlash against its paper, the Wesleyan Argus, over its publication of an editorial that criticized Black Lives Matter. The editorial led to a boycott effort and demands that the paper have its opinion pages censored going forward.
