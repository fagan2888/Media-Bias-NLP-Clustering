And we hear what happens when you change the way hospitals and doctors get paid.\n\nFor more, see our stories 3 Ways Obamacare Is Changing The Way A Hospital Cares For Patients and Hospital Puts Docs On The Spot To Lower Costs.\n\nMusic: Cold War Kids's \"Hospital Beds\" Find us: Twitter/ Facebook/Spotify/ Tumblr.
