He was a good friend to all of our players. He was a special young man,\u201d Poudre varsity baseball coach Russell Haigh said.\n\nAlthough only a sophomore, Taylor\u2019s talent and 6-foot-4, 210-pound-frame made him an excellent college baseball prospect. He became the varsity team\u2019s No. 2 pitcher and starting first baseman at age 15, Haigh said.\n\nHe was also an excellent hitter, Haigh said, with potential for a \u201cbrilliant sports career.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor me, he could be a little quiet. Sometimes, you wonder if you are getting through to him. He would take what you would tell him and work and work and work on it,\u201d Haigh said. \u201cHe was an outstanding young person.\u201d\n\nMany high school friends wrote online tributes to Taylor.\n\n\u201cI was Taylor\u2019s first best friend and also the one who started calling him TayTay not knowing it would stick,\u201d Sidney Hilsabeck wrote. \u201cIt still seems unreal that my TayTay is gone, but I know he is always with us. I love you TayTay!\u201d\n\nOne week before his death, Taylor was in superb health, Haigh said. He showed flu-like symptoms on a Thursday and died four days later, O\u2019Donnell said.\n\nOnly seven people contract plague in the U.S. each year, and the last time it was confirmed in Larimer County was in 1999. Septicemic plague, the most life-threatening form of the infection, \u201cgoes straight into the blood,\u201d O\u2019Donnell said.\n\nTaylor likely came into contact with the plague through a flea bite or after having contact with a dead animal on the family\u2019s property in the rural Cherokee Park area northwest of Fort Collins, O\u2019Donnell said.\n\nTaylor\u2019s family wanted the boy\u2019s name released so that the many people who attended a memorial service for him on their property would be cautious in the event they experience flu-like symptoms, such as fever, O\u2019Donnell said Saturday.\n\nMany people visited the family\u2019s home after Taylor\u2019s death \u2014 before the cause of death was identified \u2014 officials said the family is reaching out to those who visited their home or attended the scattering of his ashes on their ranch.\n\n\u201cThey had this big ceremony that a few hundred people attended,\u201d O\u2019Donnell said. \u201cThey would hate to see people get sick from it. There\u2019s a very slim chance that anyone would.\u201d\n\nStill, there is a small chance that others might have been bitten by infected fleas, so anyone who was on the family\u2019sland in the past seven days should seek medical attention immediately if a fever occurs, she said. The last exposure to others was likely June 14.\n\nThose who attended services in Fort Collins on June 10 or June 13 are not at risk, nor is there any risk related to past contact with the boy, his family\n\nor friends, health department officials said.\n\nLarimer County has logged only three cases of plague in the past 30 years, O\u2019Donnell said. The health department is coordinating the investigation, working with the experts from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the State Health Department, and the Larimer County coroner\u2019s office.\n\nTaylor\u2019s death hit his teammates hard, Haigh said. They wear patches on their uniforms in his memory. \u201cThey are doing well. That\u2019s not to say they do not have pain. Young men are amazingly resilient,\u201d Haigh said. \u201cI think it helps that they continue to play baseball. I think that\u2019s what Taylor would want them to do.\u201d\n\nGaes\u2019 family have asked people to donate to the Taylor Gaes Memorial Baseball Fund to pay youth baseball league entrance fees for kids. As of Saturday afternoon, more than $2,000 of their $20,000 goal had been raised.\n\n\u201cTaylor Gaes loved the game of baseball. It was a passion that lived in every part of his life and person,\u201d a statement on fund\u2019s crowdfunding site says.\n\n\u201cThe belief that any kid should have the opportunity to play the game of baseball was a passion of his,\u201d the statement says. \u201cHe never understood why money should play a factor in a young person\u2019s ability to experience the joys of the game.\u201d\n\nKirk Mitchell: 303-954-1206, denverpost.com/coldcases or twitter.com/kirkmitchell", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "16-year-old Larimer County athlete ID\u2019d as septicemic plague fatality", "title": "16-year-old Larimer County athlete ID\u2019d as septicemic plague fatality", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/06/20/16-year-old-larimer-county-athlete-idd-as-septicemic-plague-fatality/", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150620__gaes2p1.jpg", "height": 649}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150620__gaes2p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-06-20T11:06:12+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-24T13:04:08+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdace3\"", "article_summary": "Taylor Thomas Gaes died June 8 of septicemic plague, a fast-moving form of the bacterial infection, according Larimer County Health Department spokeswoman Katie O\u2019Donnell.\nThe health department is coordinating the investigation, working with the experts from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the State Health Department, and the Larimer County coroner\u2019s office.\nI love you TayTay!\u201dOne week before his death, Taylor was in superb health, Haigh said.\nLarimer County has logged only three cases of plague in the past 30 years, O\u2019Donnell said.\nOnly seven people contract plague in the U.S. each year, and the last time it was confirmed in Larimer County was in 1999."}
