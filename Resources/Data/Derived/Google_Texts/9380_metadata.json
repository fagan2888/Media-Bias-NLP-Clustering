(Photo: AP / File )\n\nThe federal director of Medicaid programs has put Tennessee on notice that it has failed to provide services for people as required by the Affordable Care Act and is giving the state 10 days to submit a correction plan.\n\nThe crux of the problem is delays with bringing a $35 million computer system online. However, Tennessee is also criticized for not providing people with face-to-face help in applying and for not setting up a program that allows hospitals to temporarily enroll people in Medicaid if they are presumed eligible.\n\nWith this year's full implementation of the Affordable Care Act, Tennessee stopped providing state personnel to help people sign up for Medicaid and, instead, began directing them to use healthcare.gov, the federal health exchange.\n\nRelated: Tennessee fails to follow law to protect babies\n\nCindy Mann, the federal director of Medicaid, said this arrangement \"was approved as a short-term measure, not a long-term solution,\" in a letter dated June 27 to TennCare Director Darin Gordon. She said her agency had expressed concerns for the past nine months about continued delays and the \"downstream impact\" on the state's ability to enroll Medicaid-eligible people.\n\nGordon, in an interview with The Tennessean, said he would have liked to have seen better performance from Northrop Grumman, the company that got the bid to build the $35 million computer system.\n\n\"Out of their total $35 million contract, they've been paid $5 million,\" Gordon said. \"They met those deliverables to get paid that $5 million, but they haven't met the others. That's why they haven't been paid.\"\n\nHe said TennCare's project management team had \"grown skeptical\" of the company's ability to predict benchmarks toward bringing the system online. So the state will contract with another company to audit Northrop Grumman's progress and provide projections for when it will be ready.\n\nHe also said the state was hampered at meeting deadlines when federal officials changed what they required out of the new system.\n\nMann in her letter said that of seven critical success factors required of states, Tennessee had met only one \u2014 the ability to receive and process application files from the Health Insurance Marketplace.\n\nGordon said TennCare has enrolled more than 95,000 people since January \u2014 the highest number since TennCare started in the 1990s. However, the state does not have a reliable system for confirming eligibility, according to TennCare rules, according to the letter from Mann.\n\nReach Tom Wilemon at 615-726-5961 and on Twitter @TomWilemon.\n\nTennCare failures\n\n\u2022 Ability to accept a single, streamlined application\n\n\u2022 Ability to convert state income standards to new federal standards\n\n\u2022 Ability to convey Tennessee eligibility rules to the Health Insurance Marketplace, the federal exchange\n\n\u2022 Ability to process applications on new income rules\n\n\u2022 Ability to respond to inquiries from the Health Insurance Marketplace about applicants' current Medicaid coverage\n\n\u2022 Ability to verify eligibility based upon electronic data services\n\n\u2014 Cindy Mann, federal director of Medicaid services\n\nRead or Share this story: http://www.tennessean.com/story/news/health/2014/07/08/feds-blast-tenncare-following-health-law/12387527/", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "The federal government has given Tennessee's Medicaid program 10 days to submit a correction plan.", "og": {"site_name": "The Tennessean", "description": "The federal government has given Tennessee's Medicaid program 10 days to submit a correction plan.", "title": "Feds give Tennessee 10 days to address ACA failures", "url": "http://www.tennessean.com/story/news/health/2014/07/08/feds-blast-tenncare-following-health-law/12387527/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/tennessean.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The federal government has given Tennessee's Medicaid program 10 days to submit a correction plan.", "creator": "@tennessean", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/673ee8b7531af4ed60e12094f48ac77d46f45680/c=286-0-1715-1429&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/Nashville/2014/07/08/-haslambudget.jpeg-0523b.jpg20110203.jpg", "title": "Feds give Tennessee 10 days to address ACA failures", "site": "@tennessean", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600028886", "fb": {"app_id": 121487414583460}, "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"category": "news/health", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/d81b0710631f08f86caa5332e748ace438279f66/c=464-0-1536-1429/local/-/media/Nashville/2014/07/08/-haslambudget.jpeg-0523b.jpg20110203.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/0bee72a7ac59a26faf2245809f407f033a478bb7/c=286-0-1715-1429/local/-/media/Nashville/2014/07/08/-haslambudget.jpeg-0523b.jpg20110203.jpg", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/fd929b13fbc8752c5922ba39b85acdef5e5e5423/c=48-0-1953-1429/local/-/media/Nashville/2014/07/08/-haslambudget.jpeg-0523b.jpg20110203.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/b16d6a209a1c52e3c7b1e4774ebf1af6f5e1b5c7/c=0-152-2000-1277&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/Nashville/2014/07/08/-haslambudget.jpeg-0523b.jpg20110203.jpg", "publishtime": "2014-07-08T21:10:00.203000-05:00", "shorthed": "Feds blast TennCare for not following health law", "articleid": 12387527, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/909a7a305f8c09175fff3064657ca5a2883aa164/c=0-152-2000-1277/local/-/media/Nashville/2014/07/08/-haslambudget.jpeg-0523b.jpg20110203.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/b3cee808e7efd3fa5bc97bc23380a5cb388ec547/c=598-0-1402-1429/local/-/media/Nashville/2014/07/08/-haslambudget.jpeg-0523b.jpg20110203.jpg"}, "author": "Tom Wilemon", "title": "Feds give Tennessee 10 days to address ACA failures", "pageclass": "article", "gci-asset-type": "story"}, "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/pages/Tom-WilemonThe-Tennessean/120277341389247?ref=hl"}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd83ae\"", "article_summary": "TennCare Director Darin Gordon, left, and Chief Financial Officer Scott Pierce at budget hearings at the state Capitol in 2011.\nThe crux of the problem is delays with bringing a $35 million computer system online.\nGordon said TennCare has enrolled more than 95,000 people since January \u2014 the highest number since TennCare started in the 1990s.\nHe said TennCare's project management team had \"grown skeptical\" of the company's ability to predict benchmarks toward bringing the system online.\nWith this year's full implementation of the Affordable Care Act, Tennessee stopped providing state personnel to help people sign up for Medicaid and, instead, began directing them to use healthcare.gov, the federal health exchange."}
