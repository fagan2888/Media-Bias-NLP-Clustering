The key to any successful presidential campaign is the ability to travel coast-to-coast, north to south and from big cities to small towns.

For Republican Presidential candidate Donald Trump, his ability to travel includes his own private Boeing 757-200 jet he’s owned since 2011.

The jet, which was built in 1991, has been dubbed by some as “Trump Force One” and can hold up to 43 passengers. It is powered by two Rolls Royce engines and is equipped with a dining room, main lounge, VIP area, guest bedroom along with a personal master bedroom and bathroom for Trump.

The plane also features 24 karat gold plated seat belts, a 57-inch TV with a state-of-the-art sound system and touch screen controls.

Trump bought the plane for $100 million from Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen in February 2011. The 757 is the “standard issue” campaign jet presidential candidates have used in the past.

The 757 has a top speed of 609 miles an hour and can fly up to 4,400 miles without stopping for fuel.

In addition to the 757, Trump also owns a Cessna Citation X corporate jet and two Sikorsky S-76B helicopters built in 1989 and 1992.
