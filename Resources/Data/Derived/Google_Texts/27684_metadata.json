We see it all the time on social media from tweets to Facebook posts to comments on blogs and forums; the comments on and about fat definitely show prevalence. In fact, these fat-focused comments are so prevalent that Wen-ying Sylvia Chou of the National Institutes of Health in the US undertook a study with her team about these phenomena on social media as reported by Springer.\n\nThe team analyzed 1.27 million posts from over sixty days on different social media platforms including Twitter, Facebook, forums, Flickr and YouTube. Twitter definitely owned most of these with 1.15 million posts of the terms, followed distantly by Facebook with 51,090 posts. Blogs had 25,438, forums 13,616, and comments otherwise only had 6,166.\n\nChou\u2019s research found that \u2018fat jokes\u2019 and cyber-bullying about obesity are disturbingly high. In fact, the social media with the most was Twitter, although other social media environments were not without their derogatory comments. The study further confirmed that many of the comments used negative, derogatory or misogynistic tones and language. The research was published in Springer\u2019s journal Translational Behavior Medicine and includes examples of some of the hurtful comments about fat and obesity:\n\n\u2022 Example 1: Ewwwwww fat people disgust me!!! [Twitter]\n\n\u2022 Example 2: I hate when your on the bus or train and a fat person tries to squeeze in a seat that they have no business squeezing into. Fat people should only get one seat like everyone else. [Facebook]\n\n\u2022 Example 3: Fat person: \u201cThe problem is, obesity runs in our family.\u201d Doctor: \u201cNo, the problem is, no one runs in your family.\u201d [Twitter]\n\n\u2022 Example 4: @USERNAME, you\u2019re an ugly fat b****. kill yourself. [Twitter]\n\n\u2022 Example 5: ATTENTION FAT B*****S: Stop wearing tight a** pants and leggings, that s*** is nasty! Wear baggy jeans or overalls\u2026 [Twitter]\n\n\u2022 Example 6: I hate when a FAT chick can\u2019t cook.... Umm ok b**** you just fat for no reason at all [Twitter]\n\nIn each of the above comments, the tone is cruel, judgmental and negative. In example 4, the post moves into bullying and aggression directly. None of these comments is acceptable on any level, yet social media environments find themselves full of derogatory posts just like these.\n\nBut these are not the only comments found on social media. There are also those that are self-deprecating and self-inflicted:\n\n\u2022 Example 7: I just ate McDonalds. full as hell! coca cola, 2 cheeseburgers and of course medium fries\u2026what a fat a** i m! [Facebook]\n\n\u2022 Example 8: I\u2019m Not Fat! My Stomach Is Just 3D. [Twitter]\n\nIn both of these, the poster attacks him or herself with the harmful comments about fat. As upsetting as the first six examples are, the fact that people attack themselves shows just how dangerous negative speak and thought about fat is.\n\nDespite these examples, Chou and her team did find something positive in their research. Some of the posts focused not on the derogatory or misogynistic nature of the above, but on the informational and supportive content.\n\n\u2022 Example 9: Two thirds of the country are overweight or obese and 30,0000 people will die this year from the complications of obesity,\u2026. The main causes of obesity are increased consumption of high calorie foods, lack of exercise, genetics, medical treatments and psychological problems. [Blog]\n\n\u2022 Example 10: Very important #infographic on portion sizes and the #obesity epidemic [URL included] #health #diet #food [Twitter]\n\n\u2022 Example 11: Should Happy Meals be blamed for rising obesity among US children? http:\u2026 [Twitter]\n\n\u2022 Example 12: I started dieting a week before Christmas and have dropped 21 lb. went shopping yesterday to buy all my healthy goodies and end up spending $250 dollars. I understand why there are overweight people, because everything that is good and healthy for you is so damn expensive. [Facebook]\n\nThese posts provide good information and thoughtful ideas about the issues surrounding obesity. They provide helpful links instead of demoralizing insults. To further show that not all comments were painful, Chou\u2019s team also found some that countered weight-based stereotypes as well as provided personal weight management experiences:\n\n\u2022 Example 13: Some people are so cruel and shallow. Just because I\u2019m overweight doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m less of a person. I\u2019m beautiful the way I am and I don\u2019t care what some loser on facebook has to say about it. [Facebook]\n\n\u2022 Example 14: I think they should create an overweight barbie. To prove all shapes and sizes are beautiful. [Twitter]\n\n\u2022 Example 15: I\u2019m on a diet. I\u2019m still overweight but I\u2019ve gone from 230 lb. to 210. Its going well\u2014I feel tremendous, but I\u2019m not so sure I look it?\u2026I\u2019m afraid I will always see my self as fat (like I do now). is there any advice? Suggestions. anything ps. [Forum post]\n\n\u2022 Example 16: I started dieting a week before Christmas and have dropped 21 lb. went shopping yesterday to buy all my healthy goodies and end up spending $250 dollars. I understand why there are overweight people, because everything that is good and healthy for you is so damn expensive. [Facebook]\n\nEach of these provides some experience or thought to help people who struggle with their weight. The problem, though, is that the majority of the posts in social media environments were neither helpful nor supportive like these. The majority of posts were cruel and bullying.\n\nAs Chou sums it up, \u201cTwitter and Facebook posts are dominated by derogatory and misogynist sentiment, pointing to weight stigmatization, whereas blogs and forums are safe online havens that provide support against weight bias. Social media must therefore not be viewed simply as breeding grounds for weight stigma, but also as encouraging and supportive environments.\u201d\n\nWith about 69 percent of US adults suffering from being overweight or obese today, the stigma and the way people talk about \u2018fat\u2019 really is damaging. Obesity-caused illnesses are dangerous, and making light of fat jokes implies that fat people do not matter. But they do. All of us need to work together to make healthy living a priority, accessible and affordable. Insulting others just further perpetuates the stigma and harms everyone.\n\nLet\u2019s learn from Chou\u2019s findings and make more of those fat posts good and eliminate the bad and the ugly ones.\n\n-----", "article_metadata": {"author": "redOrbit", "og": {"site_name": "Redorbit", "description": "New research from the National Institutes of Health analyzes how people chat about weight on different social media platforms", "title": "Fat Jokes On Social Media Are More Damaging Than Helpful - Redorbit", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://www.redorbit.com/media/uploads/2014/10/fat-shaming-on-social-media.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-10-04T12:12:09+00:00", "url": "http://www.redorbit.com/news/general/1113249557/obesity-related-fat-jokes-on-social-media-100414/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Redorbit", "description": "New research from the National Institutes of Health analyzes how people chat about weight on different social media platforms", "title": "Fat Jokes On Social Media Are More Damaging Than Helpful - Redorbit", "image": {"src": "http://www.redorbit.com/media/uploads/2014/10/fat-shaming-on-social-media.jpg"}, "creator": "@redorbit", "site": "@redorbit", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/RedOrbitDotCom", "section": "Featured", "published_time": "2014-10-04T09:24:49+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-10-04T12:12:09+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "H0n_gqVTbBRtIV06tup3EkFqf1YrUgQZpMjsayDdsUg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb46b\"", "article_summary": "In fact, the social media with the most was Twitter, although other social media environments were not without their derogatory comments.\nThe problem, though, is that the majority of the posts in social media environments were neither helpful nor supportive like these.\nThe team analyzed 1.27 million posts from over sixty days on different social media platforms including Twitter, Facebook, forums, Flickr and YouTube.\nLet\u2019s learn from Chou\u2019s findings and make more of those fat posts good and eliminate the bad and the ugly ones.\nWe see it all the time on social media from tweets to Facebook posts to comments on blogs and forums; the comments on and about fat definitely show prevalence."}
