Regin\u2019s list of spying targets and advanced design indicate the U.S. and Israel may have once again collaborated to create the surveillance malware, since Iran was identified as one of the countries infected by the program.\n\n\u201cIt is likely that its development took months, if not years, to complete and its authors have gone to great lengths to cover its tracks,\u201d the Symantec team said in its report. \u201cIts capabilities and the level of resources behind Regin indicate that it is one of the main cyberespionage tools used by a nation state.\u201d\n\n\n\n[READ: Will Surveillance Reform Get a Second Act?]\n\nRegin is a trojan that tricks a user into uploading it. From there it then carries out broad surveillance functions like stealing passwords, screenshots, and network traffic. The hacker controlling the malware can even capture deleted files and take control of a mouse\u2019s point and click commands, Symantec reports.\n\nThe spyware has an equally impressive ability to disguise itself by working in five stages, only the first of which is detectable because each step is encrypted, leaving Symantec uncertain of how the malware spreads.\n\n\u201cSymantec believes that some targets may be tricked into visiting spoofed versions of well-known websites and the threat may be installed through a Web browser or by exploiting an application,\u201d the company said.\n\n[ALSO: China's Two-Step on Tech Trade]\n\nRegin has been used to conduct surveillance since at least 2008 on 10 countries, with 52 percent of the uncovered incidents occurring in Russia and Saudi Arabia, according to the report. The other targets identified by Symantec are Mexico, Ireland, India, Afghanistan, Iran, Belgium, Austria and Pakistan. In each of these nations telecommunications companies were 28 percent of the targets and 48 percent of the targets were private citizens or small businesses, indicating that tracking the calls and online behavior of wealthy individuals was a priority.", "article_metadata": {"zone": "homepage/articles", "keyword": "Cybersecurity [News]", "title": "Regin Spyware Monitored Russian, Saudi Networks", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "Malware may have been built by U.S. or Israel, which developed past Stuxent virus.", "title": "Regin Spyware Monitored Russian, Saudi Networks", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2014/11/24/regin-spyware-monitored-russian-saudi-networks", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/bc/61/bcdb4de74487b4898789819f6827/141124-malware-stock.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@USNews", "description": "Malware may have been built by U.S. or Israel, which developed past Stuxent virus.", "card": "summary", "title": "Regin Spyware Monitored Russian, Saudi Networks"}, "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "site": "news", "date_published": "Nov. 24, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "Tom Risen,Pulse,cybersecurity,Russia,Saudi Arabia,internet,Cybersecurity [News]", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Malware may have been built by U.S. or Israel, which developed past Stuxent virus."}, "article_summary": "The other targets identified by Symantec are Mexico, Ireland, India, Afghanistan, Iran, Belgium, Austria and Pakistan.\nThe hacker controlling the malware can even capture deleted files and take control of a mouse\u2019s point and click commands, Symantec reports.\nRegin is a trojan that tricks a user into uploading it.\nFrom there it then carries out broad surveillance functions like stealing passwords, screenshots, and network traffic.\n\u201cIts capabilities and the level of resources behind Regin indicate that it is one of the main cyberespionage tools used by a nation state.\u201d[READ: Will Surveillance Reform Get a Second Act?]"}
