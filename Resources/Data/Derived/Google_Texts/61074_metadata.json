So the Golden State Warriors skipped it.\n\nInstead, they smiled a bit, laughed a bit and congratulated one another in muted tones once they were off the Pepsi Center court.\n\nBecause 15-0 deserved at least that.\n\nGolden State matched the best start in NBA history \u2014 15 consecutive wins to start a season \u2014 after putting away the Nuggets 118-105 on Sunday night. They had never shied away from saying they wanted the record. Afterward, they weren\u2019t shy about articulating the meaning of it.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a huge accomplishment,\u201d guard Stephen Curry said. \u201cObviously, coming off a championship and taking care of business 15 straight times to start the season \u2014 couldn\u2019t ask for a better start. Maybe two games ago, it became a real conversation in the locker room. Since we\u2019re here, might as well get it done.\u201d\n\nThe Nuggets didn\u2019t want that. Certainly not on their home court.\n\nPHOTOS: Here are the best action shots from Warriors at Nuggets\n\n\u201cIn my mind, I definitely wanted to stop the streak,\u201d Nuggets guard Emmanuel Mudiay said. \u201cJust because I hate records being set on me or any of my teammates.\u201d\n\nBut this couldn\u2019t be stopped because, right now, Golden State simply can\u2019t be stopped. The Warriors are just that good.\n\nStill, getting to the brink of history required putting away a Nuggets team that played a better game than the final score indicated. The Nuggets took a lead in the second quarter, had the game within single digits for much of the third, and although the fourth began with them down 12, that margin in no way is an insurmountable lead in the NBA.\n\nUnless, of course, the opponent is Golden State.\n\nThe Nuggets have had season-long problem with allowing too many 3-point shots. That, coupled with the team deadliest from behind the arc, was a combustible combination. The Nuggets were outscored 45-12 from beyond the 3-point line as Golden State drained them from deep all night long. Such marksmanship proved the biggest difference in the contest.\n\n\u201cEvery single night, we give up 12 to 15 3-point shots,\u201d Nuggets coach Michael Malone said. \u201cIt\u2019s tough to make that difference up because we are not a 3-point-shooting team.\u201d\n\nTurnovers were a problem early for the Nuggets, who had more of them at one point (11) than field goals (10). They finished with 20 turnovers, which didn\u2019t sit well with Malone.\n\nOffensively, the Nuggets were potent until the latter stages of the third. That\u2019s when Golden State\u2019s defense tightened, and it turned Nuggets misses into fast-break points. They had 25 in all.\n\n\u201cWe did a lot of good things, but against that team, you can\u2019t go offense, offense, offense, offense,\u201d Mudiay said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to get stops. (On offense) we were getting anything we wanted, it\u2019s just we weren\u2019t getting stops. You\u2019ve got to get stops with that team.\u201d\n\nSunday\u2019s game won\u2019t be remembered for a vintage Curry performance. There simply wasn\u2019t one. The superstar guard scored 19 points and made three 3-pointers, but his makes were more of the timely variety than the knockout blows they normally are.\n\nBut none of that mattered in the end. Golden State can break the record by beating the Lakers on Tuesday night in the loudest arena in the NBA: Oracle Arena.\n\n\u201cSince we\u2019re at 15, might as well get 16,\u201d Curry said. \u201cThat\u2019s the next step. So, excited about that challenge.\u201d\n\nChristopher Dempsey: cdempsey@denverpost.com or @dempseypost", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Nuggets couldn\u2019t stop Golden State steamroller at home", "title": "Nuggets couldn\u2019t stop Golden State steamroller at home", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/11/22/nuggets-couldnt-stop-golden-state-steamroller-at-home/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151122__bkn-nugs-statep1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151122__bkn-nugs-statep1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2015-11-22T20:54:20+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-20T04:51:59+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe258e\"", "article_summary": "\u201cWe did a lot of good things, but against that team, you can\u2019t go offense, offense, offense, offense,\u201d Mudiay said.\nSo the Golden State Warriors skipped it.\n\u201cJust because I hate records being set on me or any of my teammates.\u201dBut this couldn\u2019t be stopped because, right now, Golden State simply can\u2019t be stopped.\nThe Nuggets were outscored 45-12 from beyond the 3-point line as Golden State drained them from deep all night long.\nGolden State can break the record by beating the Lakers on Tuesday night in the loudest arena in the NBA: Oracle Arena."}
