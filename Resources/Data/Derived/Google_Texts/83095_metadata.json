Administrator Mark Rosekind touted the NHTSA\u2019s honor system of regulation as \u201cproactive\u201d at a hearing last Thursday before a subcommittee of the House Commerce Committee.\n\n\u201cWe will continue to keep doing everything we know that works,\u201d Rosekind responded to Representative Frank Pallone, Jr., (D-NJ), who challenged the agreements as lacking subs\n\ntance. Rosekind insisted that the NHTSA did not abdicate its regulatory authority in making what he called its \u201chistoric\u201d January deal with 18 automakers, a deal in which the automakers made commitments to safety improvements such as enhanced early warning reporting data analysis.\n\nRosekind made the case, apparently without irony, that the car companies have agreed to a 100 percent driver response to recalls, including the ongoing recalls associated with Takata Corporation\u2019s faulty airbags. The legislators spent an extended period of time discussing with Rosekind and industry\n\nrepresentatives who were on hand the problem of getting more drivers to respond to recall notices by checking their vehicle identification numbers on the SaferCar.gov website, which lists recalls. The discussion included ideas such as using insurance companies to communicate with drivers in renewal notices, as well as the problem of \u201crecall fatigue.\u201d In a year when major automakers and suppliers such as General Motors, Toyota, Volkswagen and Takata are facing lawsuits for having endangered their customers or the environment and then lying to cover up their wrongdoing, for a committee hearing with the NHTSA to focus on drivers\u2019 irresponsibility in responding to belated recalls is worse than absurd. It reveals the government\u2019s ultimate complicity with corporate America\u2019s betrayal of the American people.\n\nRosekind also lauded a \u201ccommitment\u201d by 20 major manufacturers to install automatic emergency braking in every new car by September 2022. \u201cNHTSA estimates that the agreement will make AEB standard on new cars three years faster than the agency believes it could likely achieve through the regulatory process based upon the agency\u2019s past experience in mandating advanced safety technologies,\u201d Rosekind said in his introductory statement. \u201cDuring those three years, according to [Insurance Institute for Highway Safety] estimates, the commitment will prevent 28,000 crashes and 12,000 injuries.\u201d\n\nIn defending voluntary \u201ccommitments,\u201d Rosekind referred to enforceable regulations as \u201cthe old cat and mouse game\u201d and stressed the need for cooperation between government and manufacturers. There is a cat and mouse game being played here, alright.\n\nSource: Law360.com. NHTSA Head Defends Voluntary Industry Deal\n\ndailyreportingsuite,com.
