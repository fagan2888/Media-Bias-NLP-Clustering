David Holmberg, a Highmark executive, will succeed him.\n\nHolmberg, 55, was president of Highmark's diversified businesses, which include vision, dental and stop-loss insurance companies, and has spent much of his career in the retail industry. The San Antonio-based division posted $3.5 billion in revenue last year, about a quarter of Highmark's $14.9 billion in total revenue.\n\n\u201cThis is a time of significant change across the health care marketplace, and David will be the right leader at the right time to accelerate the transformation of our organization,\u201d Chairman J. Robert Baum said in a written statement.\n\nNeither Winkenwerder nor Holmberg, who will relocate from Texas to Pittsburgh, was available for comment, spokesman David Carter said.\n\nBaum could not be reached.\n\nWinkenwerder, a former assistant secretary in the Department of Defense and an insurance executive, joined Highmark in July 2012 and was viewed as a steadying influence for an organization reeling from a scandal involving its previous CEO, growing uncertainty over whether it would close a complex deal to acquire a struggling hospital system and an increasingly bitter contract fight with rival UPMC.\n\n\u201cHe came in at a difficult time,\u201d Carter said.\n\nTwenty-two months later, Highmark is still fighting with UPMC over a reimbursement contract, but it completed the more than $1 billion acquisition of West Penn Allegheny Health System, which it combined with two other hospitals to form Allegheny Health Network.\n\nThe system is making progress on a financial turnaround.\n\n\u201cDuring his tenure, Highmark Health became an integrated health care delivery system by creating the Allegheny Health Network. We thank him for his dedicated service,\u201d Baum said of Winkenwerder in the statement.\n\nHighmark's health insurance division, despite discounting premiums to retain employer-group customers, was among the most successful insurers that sold individual plans through online marketplaces established by the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe company signed up 131,000 people through Healthcare.gov, about 40 percent of the state's total.\n\nCarter said Winkenwerder's departure was not related to his inability to secure a contract with UPMC. When the contract expires at the end of this year, most of UPMC's hospitals and doctors will be out-of-network to Highmark insurance subscribers.\n\nWinkenwerder was paid $4.3 million last year. Carter was unable to provide details of Winkenwerder's severance package.\n\nHolmberg, paid $1.6 million last year, was appointed CEO by Highmark's board of directors at a meeting on Tuesday night. The board selected him for his experience meeting consumer demands.\n\nBefore joining Highmark in 2007, Holmberg was executive vice president of operations for Jo-Ann Stores Inc. and held executive positions with Cole Licensed Brands and Zales Corp.\n\nCarter said Holmberg has a \u201cskill set that this company needs,\u201d including his experience building Highmark's Visionworks retail eyeglass business and Davis Vision insurance subsidiary into large and profitable enterprises.\n\n\u201cHealth care is moving in a direction where consumers are taking control of the health care spend,\u201d he said.\n\nFormer CEO Ken Melani, fired in April 2012 after getting into a fistfight with the husband of his mistress, hired Holmberg and praised Highmark's decision to elevate him to CEO.\n\n\u201cHe developed one of the largest integrated vision companies in the world,\u201d Melani said. \u201cI know that the employees will rally around Dave.\u201d\n\nMelani said Holmberg lacks experience on the medical side of Highmark's business but is a \u201cfast learner\u201d with a \u201cgreat team around him.\u201d\n\nPaul Fronstin, a senior research associate with the Employee Benefit Research Institute in Washington, said health insurers and health care companies are reaching out to leaders in other industries to take what they've done to engage consumers.\n\n\u201cThe health care industry is trying to find those types of people so we can apply what's happening in other industries to health care,\u201d Fronstin said. Although insurance companies are giving consumers more tools and resources to make health care decisions, it's uncertain if the approach will work, he said.\n\n\u201cThere's going to be a lot of experimentation. There's going to be a lot of trial and error because it's so new,\u201d he said.\n\nLuis F\u00e1bregas and Alex Nixon are Trib Total Media staff writers.
