That\u2019s a huge differential, especially considering the average new medical school graduate carried $166,750 in debt last year.\n\n\u201cWe need enough skilled physicians to accommodate the demands that newly insured Americans will place on the health system,\u201d Christina LaMontagne, vice president of health at Nerdwallet said in a statement. \u201cFuture physicians will need more incentives to go into primary care if we are to avoid worsening the primary care shortage. Health care reform will be unsuccessful if not accompanied by reform in graduate medical education.\u201d\n\nThe study found that fewer than half of all doctors would still choose a medical degree\u2013 but if they had to choose again, internists were the least likely of all doctors to say they\u2019d go into the same specialty.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "When an estimated 14 million uninsured Americans get Obamacare coverage next year, there may not be enough doctors to treat them.
