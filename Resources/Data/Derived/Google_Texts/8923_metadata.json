For hospitals and healthcare organizations, ACA open enrollments create financial and operational challenges as they try to cope with an influx of new patients who already have health problems and may be at risk to pay.\n\n\u201cThe people who are enrolling in these plans generally are sicker,\u201d said Jon Zimmerman, vice president and general manager of clinical business solutions at GE Healthcare. Which means they\u2019re more likely to seek treatment under the terms of their new health insurance plan.\n\nThe problem is that many of these new patients may be facing extremely high deductibles or coinsurance costs. For example, the \u201cbronze\u201d and \u201csilver\u201d plans offered under state healthcare exchanges can require deductibles of as much as $2,000.\n\n[See also: Assessing next generation revenue cycle management readiness.]\n\n\u201cThey may think, \u2018Well, I\u2019ve got insurance, everything\u2019s paid for,\u2019 when it\u2019s not,\u201d Zimmerman said. \u201cTheir plans may have specific and important deductibles, so when they show up, you better know what kind of financial liability this individual has under their new plan.\u201d\n\nThis is critical because many patients may be confused by details of their plans and what their own financial responsibilities are under a specific plan.\n\n\u201cSome of these people haven\u2019t had healthcare insurance before, so it\u2019s a new language for them,\u201d Zimmerman said. \u201cYour front office staff needs to be pretty good at explaining how their plan works and what that means to the patients themselves.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s also imperative to establish mechanisms for collecting from patients up-front because \u201cwhen they\u2019re gone, they\u2019re gone, and it\u2019s really hard to collect afterwards,\u201d Zimmerman said. \u201cWhat processes and tools do you have to enable upfront collection? That\u2019s a big deal.\u201d\n\nOne option would be to provide \u201csome level of financial counseling\u201d as well as offering payment plans for patients who simply don\u2019t have the money to pay for their healthcare services under the terms of their new insurance, he said.\n\nIf you\u2019re going to be great at revenue cycle in this new tidal wave that\u2019s coming, you better have the right people, process and tools in place.\n\nHospital CFOs also should have a thorough understanding of the rules and requirements of plans being offered under ACA.\n\n\u201cKnow your payers and their rules,\u201d Zimmerman said. \u201cWhat are the risk and performance characteristics of the contracts with the folks who are offering these exchange products? What are your authorization requirements? What are your reporting requirements? It may be more than just eligibility and patient liability. There might be some new authorization rules. There might be some clinical quality reporting rules.\u201d\n\nHospitals that aren\u2019t prepared for handling new patients under ACA may need to purchase an entirely new patient intake and billing system or add a \u201cbolt-on\u201d solution to the current system, Zimmerman says. Before running out and spending money, though, hospitals should first ask their current billing-system vendors if they will be able to support billing requirements under the new healthcare law.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re going to be great at revenue cycle in this new tidal wave that\u2019s coming, you better have the right people, process and tools in place,\u201d Zimmerman said. \u201cBecause you\u2019re dealing with a new reality.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/hospital-revenue-cycle-must-be-ready-aca-open-enrollment", "image": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/health%20insurance%20policy%20search.jpg", "site_name": "Healthcare Finance News", "description": "For many Americans, the ACA open enrollment period offers them an opportunity to have health insurance for the first time.
