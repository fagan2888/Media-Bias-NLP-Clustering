He was founding guitarist Dickey Betts\u2019s foil when the group reunited in 1989, before leaving with bassist Allen Woody in 1997 to focus on their band Gov\u2019t Mule. Haynes returned in 2000, providing much-needed credibility and stability after the Allman Brothers parted ways with Betts and Woody passed away.\n\nHe has been at the core of the band\u2019s sound ever since, teaming with Derek Trucks to form a powerful guitar front. In January, Haynes and Trucks jointly announced that they no longer intend to tour with the band after this year.\n\nThe group has not officially announced their plans beyond summer festival appearances, but 14 shows at New York\u2019s Beacon Theatre, March 7-29, will mark the beginning of the end of this lineup. Haynes discussed his decision and looked back at his own legacy with the Allman Brothers Band in this exclusive interview.\n\nThe announcement that you and Derek would be leaving the band at the end of the year surprised a lot of people. Why did you both feel it was so important to make a statement once rumors started circulating?\n\nThis is actually something that the whole band has been talking about for a few years now. Derek and I had been making plans based on the fact that the band was going to stop touring after the 45th anniversary. For several years we have thought about ourselves as a team. I don\u2019t think he wants to be here without me and I don\u2019t want to be here without him. I think this version of the band is that way in general, based on the initial chemistry that we had 14 years ago and that has continued to grow. Everybody adds so much in their own way to the big picture that I kind of look at as being a high water mark and a good place to stop.\n\nThen I guess in some people\u2019s minds it wasn\u2019t quite as concrete as in other people\u2019s minds, but we felt like it was the right plan and we should all stick with it. Now Gregg\u2019s come out and said he thinks it\u2019s the right plan as well, so we\u2019ll see.\n\nYou\u2019ve always seemed to thrive by juggling a lot of projects. So what\u2019s next?\n\nIt\u2019s true that being busy has never been an issue for me. Mule has a new record out [Shout!] that we\u2019re going to be continuing to promote for a long, long time and I have a lot of projects in the work: the Warren Haynes Band, a solo acoustic project and some other stuff in the works that I\u2019m not quite ready to discuss.\n\nI also have a two-and-a-half year old son that I\u2019m very excited to spend more time with, albeit my schedule will remain very busy.\n\nYou\u2019ve been called the guy who revitalized the Allman Brothers twice. How do you feel about that?\n\nTo whatever extent it\u2019s true, it\u2019s about the band being open to embracing new ideas and new blood and not expecting the new guys to keep quiet and play the old parts because a lot of bands wouldn\u2019t be capable of that. I think in the Allman Brothers, the musical equality on stage is so important that everyone understands that the only way the band is going to hit its stride and play to its potential is if everyone is equally engaged. They were very open from the very beginning to me singing, writing songs, contributing to arrangements \u2013 to anyone contributing ideas.\n\nDo you feel any extra emotion heading into this run?\n\nIt hasn\u2019t really kicked in yet, but it will. I think the shows are going to be very emotional but really good.\n\nYou\u2019ve played the Beacon over 300 times, with the Allman Brothers, Gov\u2019t Mule and Phil Lesh. No one knows the place better. Is there anything special about the room itself or is it all about the history the Allman Brothers have created there?\n\nIt\u2019s everything. The vibe at the Beacon has a lot to do with it being an old school theater and the way the energy feels coming from the audience to the stage. New York crowds are over the top and different than anywhere else, but the Beacon audiences exist on their own level, which I can\u2019t explain. Combine that with the fact all the original guys say it reminds them of the Fillmore East, where they had their greatest moments, and it all comes together into something very special.\n\nBuildings from that era were all unique, with their own personality and sound. You have to adapt, but the Beacon is so very familiar. There\u2019s nothing else quite like the feeling I get when I walk on stage there and plug in. I don\u2019t spend as much time or energy adapting or thinking. I just start playing.\n\nHow is playing an extended run different than touring? Does sleeping in the same bed every night impact the way you play?\n\nI live here so it\u2019s easy for me, and being in one spot for a long time is a breath of fresh air compared to traditional touring, but by the time the run is over, we\u2019ll all be ready to move on to something different.\n\nThe crowd energy in an extended stay is also quite different compared to a one nighter. The audience is different every night, of course, but some of it is the same and that pushes us to play differently. I know it can sound esoteric, but the energy we get from the crowd fuels the music in a very real way. We know we have to keep it very high energy on a Saturday night. The middle of the week shows tend to be hardcore fans bound and determined to see the show even though they have to get up for work in the morning. They may not be as high energy but they\u2019re very focused and that can lead to a show that\u2019s a little more relaxed and jazzy or song-oriented rather than heavy jamming. If you were to take 10 Allman Brothers fans and ask what their ideal set list would be, you would get 10 completely different answers, so we can\u2019t worry about that too much.\n\nThe Beacon shows have become famous for guest sit-ins, peaking in 2009 for the 40th anniversary, with Eric Clapton, Billy Gibbons and many others. Does that put pressure on you now?\n\nNo, I don\u2019t feel pressure to make the 45th compete with the collaborations from the 40th. We worked very hard on that, figuring out months in advance who was going to sit and in some cases even what material they would play with us. This year will be a little more relaxed, figuring it out on a day-to-day, week-to-week basis There will be a lot of cool guests showing up, but it\u2019s not going to be as formalized as it was in \u201909.\n\nNot only is it something I really enjoy, it makes each show stand out and have its own special quality \u2013 not just for the audience, but for the band as well. In order for us to enjoy 14 shows somewhat equally, they have to all be different and we have to be able to immerse ourselves.\n\nWhat are your proudest moments in the Allman Brothers?\n\nThere are so many highlights that I couldn\u2019t list them all. The thing I\u2019m most proud of is that we\u2019ve been able to carry the mantle of a great tradition, revisit the band\u2019s concept and vision and in some ways carry it into the future. And it was never based on compromise or wondering what the public would expect from a commercial standpoint. It was based on trying to tap into the vision and proud tradition of the original band.\n\nWhat was your most difficult moment?\n\nWhen [bassist Allen] Woody and I left in \u201897 to concentrate on Gov\u2019t Mule, we had been procrastinating for quite a while. It\u2019s hard to leave an institution like the Allman Brothers, even though we knew it was the right thing to do. Getting there and actually doing it was very difficult.\n\nReturning to the band in 2001 following Woody\u2019s death was the hardest thing for me emotionally. I was underneath a cloud of anguish that doesn\u2019t allow you to make decisions based on seeing the future as openly as you might otherwise. Woody and I had made our decision and were not looking back; the Allman Brothers era of my life was in the past and had he not passed away there would have been no reason to return.\n\nI was faced with this decision about whether or not to continue with Gov\u2019t Mule, which was half Woody\u2019s vision, and just what to do with myself. When Gregg called and asked me to come back it was hard for me emotionally to realize that was something I had to at least consider. But when I came back in to the band was getting along great. The current state of affairs was a lot different, everyone was playing and singing great and it became much easier for my emotions to eventually settle down to where I could better process the situation.\n\nWatching the recently released Great Woods DVD and Play all Night Beacon CDs from 1991 and 1992, I was struck by how different the guitar roles were with you and Dickey Betts than they are with you and Derek. Have you reflected on that?\n\nYeah. I\u2019ve been in an interesting position where my role as a guitar player has changed drastically. It was much more about complementing Dickey\u2019s musicality in the way that Duane Allman did. That had been Derek\u2019s role as well. So to be fair and just to make it interesting and shake it up, we decided to divide up our roles. I found myself sometimes playing with more of Dickey\u2019s influence than I ever would if I were playing with him.\n\nThat contrast is important to the band\u2019s sound, so Derek and I maintain it, but it\u2019s fluid as to who\u2019s playing which role and how much we\u2019re just flying by and being completely ourselves.\n\nWe\u2019re moment by moment deciding. I view it as a win-win situation where it can remain exciting, different and positive every night.\n\nDo those switches just happen, or are you consciously thinking about them and discussing them?\n\nIt\u2019s more of a response. The best you can do onstage is not be thinking at all; that hopefully gets done offstage and when it\u2019s time to perform, you shut down the cerebral part of your brain and just play.\n\nCan you imagine what your music would sound like today if you had never been in the Allman Brothers?\n\nThere\u2019s no way that I could possibly trace which path my playing would have taken had I not joined the Allman Brothers. It\u2019s just too intertwined. Who knows where I would have ended up.\n\nAlan Paul is the author of the best-selling book One Way Out: The Inside History of the Allman Brothers Band, published by St. Martin\u2019s.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "Warren Haynes discussed his decision to leave the Allman Brothers Band, and looked back at his own legacy, in this exclusive interview.", "title": "Warren Haynes Looks Back at the Allman Brothers", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2014/03/06/warren-haynes-looks-back-at-the-allman-brothers/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-BU567_haynes_G_20140306100333.jpg"}, "site": "WSJspeakeasy", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Arts", "article.headline": "Warren Haynes Looks Back at the Allman Brothers", "description": "Warren Haynes discussed his decision to leave the Allman Brothers Band, and looked back at his own legacy, in this exclusive interview.", "article_section": "Arts", "author": "Alan Paul", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "testkeys": "C", "article.page": "Speakeasy Blog", "page.subsection": "Speakeasy", "article.summary": "Warren Haynes discussed his decision to leave the Allman Brothers Band, and looked back at his own legacy, in this exclusive interview.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "page.content.format": "responsive", "article.published": "2014-03-06T15:05:24-05:00", "dj.asn": "10-140", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2014/03/06/warren-haynes-looks-back-at-the-allman-brothers/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-SEB-80191", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Arts", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "Warren Haynes discussed his decision to leave the Allman Brothers Band, and looked back at his own legacy, in this exclusive interview.", "title": "Warren Haynes Looks Back at the Allman Brothers", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2014/03/06/warren-haynes-looks-back-at-the-allman-brothers/", "image": {"width": 553, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-BU567_haynes_G_20140306100333.jpg", "height": 369}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Speakeasy", "article.id": "BL-SEB-80191", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2014-03-06T15:05:24-05:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd7dfc\"", "article_summary": "Warren Haynes Getty ImagesGuitarist Warren Haynes has been at the center of the Allman Brothers Band revival for most of the last 25 years.\nHaynes discussed his decision and looked back at his own legacy with the Allman Brothers Band in this exclusive interview.\nHaynes returned in 2000, providing much-needed credibility and stability after the Allman Brothers parted ways with Betts and Woody passed away.\nCan you imagine what your music would sound like today if you had never been in the Allman Brothers?\nIs there anything special about the room itself or is it all about the history the Allman Brothers have created there?"}
