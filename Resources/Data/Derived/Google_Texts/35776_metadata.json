They have greatly reduced the amount of insecticide that needs to be sprayed, and they only need to treat the weeds at one point, not several times over a growing season. Her soil has now improved, because she and her family don't have to tromp through the fields as often. The family also uses less fuel, because they spend less time in the tractor. \u201cNo one is more aware than the farmer of the impact we have on the environment, in addition to the urgency to feed and fuel a growing population, while reducing our footprint on the planet,\u201d she maintains.\n\nAnd remember folks, biotech crops are not only good for the environment, eating them as caused not so much as a cough, sniffle, sneeze or bellyache. For example, a statement issued by the Board of Directors of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the largest scientific organization in the United States, on October 20, 2012 point blank asserted that \u201ccontrary to popular misconceptions, GM [genetically modified] crops are the most extensively tested crops ever added to our food supply. There are occasional claims that feeding GM foods to animals causes aberrations ranging from digestive disorders, to sterility, tumors and premature death. Although such claims are often sensationalized and receive a great deal of media attention, none have stood up to rigorous scientific scrutiny.\u201d The AAAS Board concluded, \u201cIndeed, the science is quite clear: crop improvement by the modern molecular techniques of biotechnology is safe.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "The U.S. Department of Agriculture has released its latest data on farmers planting of crops genetically enhanced to tolerate herbicides (HT) crops and", "title": "American Farmers Just Love Their GMOs and You Should Too", "url": "http://reason.com/blog/2014/07/21/american-farmers-just-love-their-gmos-an", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14059709248970.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/mc/_external/2014_07/usda.png", "description": "The U.S. Department of Agriculture has \nreleased its latest data on farmers planting of crops\ngenetically enhanced to tolerate herbicides (HT) crops and to\nresist insect pests (Bt).\nHT soybeans went from 17 percent of U.S. soybean acreage to 94\npercent in 2014.
