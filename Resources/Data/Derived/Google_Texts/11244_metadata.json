The Germans fed their prisoners, who provided slave labor, a starvation diet of 100 to 150 calories a day.\n\n\u201cThe Germans turned us into zombies \u2026 where the only thing on your mind was food,\u201d he said.\n\nLeon Tulper, who was with Gen. George Patton\u2019s Third Army, was in the unit that liberated Ohrdruf.\n\nHe and his infantry unit were driving south after a firefight with German soldiers when they spotted the camp. \u201cWe didn\u2019t know it was a concentration camp,\u201d he said.\n\nThey passed a row of large ovens, then bins filled with clothing and, finally, bins holding bones before reaching a large barracks. Survivors of the horror began walking and stumbling from the barracks. On that day, Tulper said, he witnessed skeletons walking, and his life changed.\n\nStarving people held out their hands for food. But the soldiers were moving ahead of their supply line, and had nothing to give them.\n\n\u201cGuys were crying. None of us could believe what transpired there,\u201d Tulper said.\n\nOscar Sladek, 80, who was born in Slovakia, survived the Holocaust without spending time in a camp.\n\nFor a time, he and his parents hid with other Jews in a cabin in a mountainous area. On Christmas Day 1944, the Germans found the cabin, and Sladek and his family hid in a cave.\n\nThe Nazis burned the cabin down and sent others who had lived there to the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp.\n\nBefore a partisan who was resisting the Germans found them, \u201cwe almost starved,\u201d Sladek remembered.\n\nThey were saved when the partisans took them to a Russian army unit, he said.\n\nTwenty-two members of his extended family died. \u201cI was the only child under the age of 15 that survived,\u201d he said.\n\nTom McGhee: 303-954-1671, tmcghee@denverpost.com or twitter.com/dpmcghee", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Holocaust survivors remember the death camps at Denver memorial", "title": "Holocaust survivors remember the death camps at Denver memorial", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/04/19/holocaust-survivors-remember-the-death-camps-at-denver-memorial/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150419__holocaust1p1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150419__holocaust1p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-04-19T16:28:11+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-25T04:08:13+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "A handful of other survivors, all of whom now live in Colorado, along with a 90-year-old veteran who helped to liberate Ohrdruf, a concentration camp in Germany, shared their stories.\nThe Nazis burned the cabin down and sent others who had lived there to the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp.\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t know it was a concentration camp,\u201d he said.\nOn Christmas Day 1944, the Germans found the cabin, and Sladek and his family hid in a cave.\nOscar Sladek, 80, who was born in Slovakia, survived the Holocaust without spending time in a camp."}
