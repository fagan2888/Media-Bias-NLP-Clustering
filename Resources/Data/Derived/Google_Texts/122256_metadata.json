The smug satisfaction of aristocratic governing classes who thought they were witnessing the demise of the democratic experiment was answered four years later by a resurgence of hope and defiant spirit among its adherents everywhere.\n\nWhile the war was being fought on the battlefields of Bull Run, Antietam, and Gettysburg, another contest was waged overseas. The Confederacy sought international recognition and alliances to secure independence, and the Union was determined not to let that happen. \u201cNo battle, not Gettysburg, not the Wilderness,\u201d one historian claimed, \u201cwas more important than the contest waged in the diplomatic arena and the forum of public opinion.\u201d The history of Civil War diplomacy\u2014that is, the formal negotiations among governments and the strategies surrounding them\u2014has been told and told well. This book turns to the less familiar forum of public opinion, which was filled with clamorous debate for four years. It took place in print (in newspapers, pamphlets, and books) as well as oratory (in meeting halls, pubs, lodges, union halls, and parliaments). Wherever free speech was stifled, as it was in France, the debate continued over private dinner tables and at cafe\u0301s. Whatever one\u2019s views, there was general agreement that the American question mattered greatly to the world and to the future.\n\nThe term public diplomacy did not come into common usage until World War I, but America\u2019s Civil War witnessed what were arguably the first deliberate, sustained, state-sponsored programs aimed at influencing the public mind abroad. Diplomats for the North and South understood the enormous power the press had gained, thanks to vast improvements in print technology and the expansion of literacy, which made cheap publications and mass-audience journalism possible. They also grasped the key role that journalists, intellectuals, reformers, dissident political leaders, and other opinion leaders had in influencing popular sentiment. Not since Benjamin Franklin\u2019s residence there, US diplomat Henry Sanford wrote to Secretary of State William Seward from Paris in August 1861, had there been such an occasion for attention to cultivating public favor abroad. \u201cWe ought to spend money freely in the great centers in forming public opinion.\u201d\n\nThe Union and Confederacy each hired special agents, who usually operated under cover of some kind. They were typically veteran journalists and political operators whose job it was, as one of them deftly put it, to give \u201ca right direction to public sentiment\u201d and correct \u201cerroneous\u201d reports that favored the other side. Some bribed editors and hired journalists, while others published their own pamphlets, books, and even newspapers. Few were above planting rumors or circulating damaging stories, and some of what they produced can only be described as propaganda and misinformation. But that was only part of the story of what was more often a sophisticated appeal to ideology and values.", "article_metadata": {"description": "When the Union and the Confederacy charged into battle in 1861, the whole world was watching \u2014\u00a0and waiting", "title": "A world war on American soil: How the Civil War became a global struggle", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "When the Union and the Confederacy charged into battle in 1861, the whole world was watching \u2014\u00a0and waiting", "title": "A world war on American soil: How the Civil War became a global struggle", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/01/04/a_world_war_on_american_soil_how_the_civil_war_became_a_global_struggle/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/12/battle_of_spotsylvania.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "When the Union and the Confederacy charged into battle in 1861, the whole world was watching \u2014\u00a0and waiting", "title": "A world war on American soil: How the Civil War became a global struggle", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/12/battle_of_spotsylvania.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Don H.
