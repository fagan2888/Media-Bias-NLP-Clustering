But it sums up the mega-overreach of the Obama Administration in trying to use the Affordable Care Act to bludgeon religious charities and schools into violating their sacred beliefs by paying for employees\u2019 contraceptives. Seven of the 92 lawsuits filed by such groups were bundled into the case argued on Wednesday. Plaintiffs include the Little Sisters of the Poor (Catholic nuns who care for the impoverished elderly) and Priests For Life, a group of pro-life activist priests. Imagine arguing that those groups don\u2019t have a sincere religious objection to paying for contraceptives!\n\nGranted, the government did offer a compromise, in which insurers would pay for contraceptives, but that\u2019s just word games. The charities pay the insurers, so they would still, in effect, be paying for contraceptives. \u201cPlausible deniability\u201d might be a good enough moral fig leaf for Washington, but God sees through it.\n\nAdvertisement \u2013 story continues below\n\nThe idea of nuns being forced to take resources away from caring for the elderly poor to fight an attempt by government to bully them into violating their most sacred beliefs is so patently outrageous that even the USA Today editorial board scolded the Obama Administration. They noted that churches and religious for-profit companies are already exempt, and some simple accommodation for this small number of employees could have prevented this expensive and repulsive legal battle.\n\nBut as we saw with Obamacare itself, this Administration is less concerned with solving a specific problem than with expanding federal power. They seem intent on using the heavy hand of government to force Americans to accommodate newly-created rights (free contraceptives, same-sex marriage), even if it violates their First Amendment right of religious freedom. With the Supreme Court now split 4-4, this is why choosing the right President to replace Justice Scalia is crucial to the continued existence of basic individual rights.\n\nDuring oral arguments, liberal Justice Stephen Breyer outrageously lectured the plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys that some burdens are the price of \u201cbeing a member of society.\u201d It\u2019s a clich\u00e9 you see on every \u201cprogressive\u201d website: paying for everyone else\u2019s health care, food, housing, college tuition, abortions, etc., is the price of being a member of society. Those who think this way need to consider what kind of \u201csociety\u201d this is. It\u2019s the only society in the world built on the Bill of Rights.\n\nAdvertisement \u2013 story continues below\n\nThe Supreme Court must make it clear that respecting other people\u2019s rights, including freedom of religion, is the price liberals have to pay to be members of American society.\n\nThe views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by the owners of this website.", "article_metadata": {"description": "An expensive and repulsive legal battle.", "author": "Mike Huckabee", "og": {"site_name": "Western Journalism", "description": "An expensive and repulsive legal battle.", "title": "Mike Huckabee Just Exposed Obama Admin's Mega-Overreach...'God Sees Through It'", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 913, "identifier": "http://www.westernjournalism.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/obamanuns.jpg", "height": 545}, "url": "http://www.westernjournalism.com/mike-huckabee-just-exposed-obama-admins-mega-overreach-god-sees-through-it/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "An expensive and repulsive legal battle.", "creator": "@WestJournalism", "image": "http://www.westernjournalism.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/obamanuns.jpg", "title": "Mike Huckabee Just Exposed Obama Admin's Mega-Overreach...'God Sees Through It'", "site": "@WestJournalism", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "DC.date.issued": "2016-03-26T09:59:24-07:00", "fb": {"app_id": 275784739127435, "pages": 123624513983}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.westernjournalism.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/android-chrome-192x192.png", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/WesternJournalism", "section": "Opinion", "tag": "Religious Freedom", "published_time": "2016-03-26T09:59:24-07:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "obamacare, religious freedom, politics, nation, religion"}, "article_summary": "The Little Sisters of the Poor.\u201dThat\u2019s not actually the name of the case heard this week by the Supreme Court.\nWith the Supreme Court now split 4-4, this is why choosing the right President to replace Justice Scalia is crucial to the continued existence of basic individual rights.\nGranted, the government did offer a compromise, in which insurers would pay for contraceptives, but that\u2019s just word games.\nImagine arguing that those groups don\u2019t have a sincere religious objection to paying for contraceptives!\nThe charities pay the insurers, so they would still, in effect, be paying for contraceptives."}
