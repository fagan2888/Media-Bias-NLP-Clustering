Big audiences in South Africa are watching a 24-hour television channel dedicated to coverage of the sensational trial. Turns of phrase from the courtroom \u2014 the defense lawyer\u2019s \u201cI put it to you\u201d challenge to prosecution witnesses \u2014 are creeping into popular culture.\n\nThe rise and fall of the double-amputee runner, who competed in the London Olympics in 2012 and then killed model Reeva Steenkamp less than a year after that inspirational triumph, is a consuming saga for South Africans that has drawn sheepish comparisons to reality television shows. The more people hear, the hungrier they are for more.\n\nWas Oscar on his stumps or wearing prosthetic limbs when he battered the toilet door with a cricket bat? Does he scream like a woman, as the defense suggests, or did neighbors indeed hear a woman\u2019s screams on the night of the killing? Will apparent missteps by police investigators muddy the prosecution\u2019s case? Did Pistorius vomit during graphic testimony about Steenkamp\u2019s wounds because of anguish, or was he trying to curry sympathy with the impassive judge?\n\nSome people turn up their noses at the spectacle, then dive into television or social media to soak up the latest, often extraordinary revelations. The parade of witnesses, some shown in the televised proceedings and some concealed from TV viewers to respect their privacy, gives a glimpse into rich, diverse, flawed and accomplished lives, swept into a single narrative from previously anonymous routines.\n\nProf. Gert Saayman, the pathologist, described Steenkamp\u2019s wounds and the general impact of gunshots on flesh and bone in metaphor-studded monologues so precise and structured that they were almost lyrical, the macabre contents notwithstanding. Here was a man, clinical and courtly, who had conducted between 10,000 and 15,000 autopsies over the decades.\n\n\u201cDeath is effectively a process rather than an event, and may take some minutes for it to come to its conclusion at a physiological level,\u201d he said.\n\nSaayman was followed by witness Darren Fresco, who dropped an expletive while recounting alleged gunplay involving Pistorius, his onetime friend, in the months before the runner shot his girlfriend. Fresco seemed miffed at the defense\u2019s suggestion that he was wearing tracksuit pants in the middle of summer, rather than shorts as he claims, during a 2012 incident in which a gun went off in a Johannesburg restaurant.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Oscar Pistorius trial enters popular culture", "title": "Oscar Pistorius trial enters popular culture", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Oscar Pistorius trial enters popular culture", "title": "Oscar Pistorius trial enters popular culture", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/03/16/oscar_pistorius_trial_enters_popular_culture/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/03/south-africa-pistorius-trial-.jpeg1-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Oscar Pistorius trial enters popular culture", "title": "Oscar Pistorius trial enters popular culture", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/03/south-africa-pistorius-trial-.jpeg1-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Christopher Torchia", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd940\"", "article_summary": "Did Pistorius vomit during graphic testimony about Steenkamp\u2019s wounds because of anguish, or was he trying to curry sympathy with the impassive judge?\nTurns of phrase from the courtroom \u2014 the defense lawyer\u2019s \u201cI put it to you\u201d challenge to prosecution witnesses \u2014 are creeping into popular culture.\nBig audiences in South Africa are watching a 24-hour television channel dedicated to coverage of the sensational trial.\nSaayman was followed by witness Darren Fresco, who dropped an expletive while recounting alleged gunplay involving Pistorius, his onetime friend, in the months before the runner shot his girlfriend.\nTopics: From the Wires, Entertainment News, NewsPRETORIA, South Africa (AP) \u2014 Children chatter about the Oscar Pistorius murder trial at South African schools, startling parents with details about how the athlete fatally shot his girlfriend."}
