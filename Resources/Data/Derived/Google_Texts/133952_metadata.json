Here are five takeaways from the game:\n\n1. The Clippers looked more like themselves. The team\u2019s Big Three came up big on the same night, with Blake Griffin, Chris Paul and DeAndre Jordan each registering a double-double. All five starters scored in double figures. The Clippers weren\u2019t sloppy, committing a season-low seven turnovers. They performed at their tempo and did well on defense for a change. \u201cI think we played with the right spirit, played with the right pace,\u201d said Paul, who had 15 points and 10 assists. \u201cWe defended.\u201d Paul paused before posing a question. \u201cDid we win the rebounding [battle]?\u201d he asked. Informed the Clippers were outrebounded, 48-43, he continued. \u201cWe still didn\u2019t,\u201d he said. \u201cWell, we tried to get on the boards a little bit more.\u201d\n\n2. Griffin\u2019s three-pointer midway through the third quarter was insane. Wesley Johnson probably should have shot the ball rather than pass to Griffin with the shot clock about to expire, but Griffin grabbed the ball while jumping in midair and heaved a shot that somehow went into the basket. \u201cWhat was crazy was Blake had missed two shots and he had passed up two,\u201d Clippers Coach Doc Rivers said. \u201cSo we had just come out of the timeout and said, \u2018Blake, you\u2019ve got to take your shots,\u2019 and then that happens and he starts laughing. I think just him laughing, the next thing you know he makes the next three [shots], so confidence is an amazing thing.\u201d Griffin\u2019s shot sparked the Clippers to a double-digit lead by the end of the third quarter and they were never seriously challenged again.\n\n3. Johnson may be the team\u2019s best option at starting small forward. His numbers \u2014 11 points, two rebounds, one assist and one block \u2014 were solid if unspectacular, but it was Johnson\u2019s energy in his first start of the season that gave the Clippers the biggest lift. Rivers said he may have stunted Johnson\u2019s development by starting him too early in the preseason at a time when he wasn\u2019t fully integrated into the team\u2019s philosophies, but he seemed to be in the flow of everything Tuesday. \u201cWes is a great player,\u201d Paul said, \u201cand I think sometimes we have more confidence in him than he has in himself.\u201d Rivers would not commit to Johnson as a permanent starter with Paul Pierce, Lance Stephenson and Luc Mbah a Moute also around as options but acknowledged he was pleased with the effort Johnson gave. \u201cI think we all kind of agreed he would be a great fit for us just because Paul might not play big minutes every game,\u201d Griffin said, \u201cso he came in and did well. But it\u2019s still nice to have guys that are interchangeable like this.\u201d\n\n4. Griffin and Nuggets Coach Mike Malone had a testy exchange. It came in the fourth quarter with Jordan at the line shooting free throws after being intentionally fouled. Griffin received a technical but Malone said after the game that he owed the Clippers an apology. \u201cAs a head coach, as a leader of this team,\u201d Malone said, \u201cI can't get caught up in that kind of stuff.\u201d Griffin declined to comment on the specifics of the exchange but said he thought the league office would review the matter and intervene appropriately. Jordan, by the way, made six of 12 free throws while being intentionally fouled.\n\n5. The Clippers need to feast on the turkeys that are their next four opponents. They\u2019re entering a stretch of four straight games against teams with losing records and six consecutive games at home as they try to put .500 in the rearview mirror. \u201cWe\u2019re at home and I think you should never lose a home game,\u201d Rivers said. \u201cIt\u2019s just my belief. Having said that, we\u2019ve done that, we\u2019ve lost two of them. So we have to start taking care of our home court.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Five takeaways from the Clippers' 111-94 victory over Denver", "Description": "Few teams have been as happy to be .500 recently as the Clippers, who climbed back to the break-even mark with\u00a0a 111-94 victory over the Denver Nuggets that snapped their three-game losing streak.
