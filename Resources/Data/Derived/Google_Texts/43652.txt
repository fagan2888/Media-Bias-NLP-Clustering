Re “Quit Whining About Your Sick Colleague,” by Daniel Engber (Op-Ed, Dec. 30):

I am sorry, but there is no way that Mr. Engber can tell me — or anyone else who works — that a co-worker’s incessant sneezing and coughing does not present a risk of contagion.

Furthermore, how productive, really, can that sick colleague be? I know for myself that when I get sick, I find it hard enough to read my favorite newspaper, much less haul myself in to work.

Those of us who get annoyed at a sick worker’s determination to come into work are not “whining”; we are justifiably angry and concerned that the colleague’s act is selfish and doesn’t take other people into consideration.

There is a reason that doctors say to get plenty of bed rest when one is sick; that is the way to get better, not “being a hero” and insisting that you are well enough, despite your hacking, to work today.

In short, coming in sick to work displays a remarkable lack of responsibility.

To the Editor:

Just when it seemed to me that workers were developing some notion that they should not expose others when they are sick, I was disappointed to see someone debunking office-worker “quarantine” as a public health measure. As an employer, I can attest that when a worker shows up coughing and sneezing, the entire office is sick within a few days as well.

And those sick days that employers give? Well, generally the employees view them as additional personal days and hoard them for more rewarding activities.
