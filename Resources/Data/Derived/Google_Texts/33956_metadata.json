Advisors who tell clients to keep assets in a retirement plan sponsored by the client\u2019s former employer do not receive any compensation.\n\n\u201cThus, a financial advisor has an economic incentive to encourage an investor to roll plan assets in an IRA that he will represent as either a broker/dealer or an investment advisor representative,\u201d FINRA said in the notice.\n\n\u201cConflicts also may exist for firms and their associated persons that are responsible for educating plan participants about their choices,\u201d the notice said.\n\n\u201cAssociated persons,\u201d also known as intermediaries, who are compensated for the number of IRAs they bring to the company, have an incentive to encourage retirement plan participants to open IRA accounts with that intermediary.\n\nMore IRA accounts opened mean more money for the advisor.\n\nFINRA said firms need to \u201csupervise these activities to reasonably ensure that conflicts of interest do not impair the judgment\u201d of brokers and advisors.\n\nWith defined contribution plans\u2019 relative paucity of income options, which retirees need to last them through 20 or 30 years of post-employment life, there is little incentive to leave assets in a 401(k).\n\nMany workers instead are taking that money and moving it into an IRA, where there are more income options for investors and retirees.\n\nCerulli Associates published a recent report on the retirement dynamics of employer-sponsored retirement plans. Bing Walder, director at Cerulli, said in a statement that the lack of in-plan retirement income options means \u201cassets accumulating in a defined contribution plan will eventually shift to an IRA.\u201d\n\nThat is exactly what is happening.\n\nIRAs aren\u2019t getting rich through contributions of accountholders. The growth in assets held in IRAs is coming mostly from money rolled over from employer-sponsored retirement plans when employees leave or retire, according to data by the Investment Company Institute (ICI).\n\nAt the end of the third quarter last year, an estimated $6.2 trillion in U.S. retirement assets was held in IRAs, according to the ICI. That represents more than a quarter of all U.S. retirement assets, ICI data show.\n\nFINRA Notice 13-45 also reminds a \u201cbroker-dealer and its associated persons\u201d to meet the suitability standard when recommending an investment strategy to secure long-term retirement goals. Brokers need to meet their \u201cfair dealing\u201d responsibilities under FINRA Rule 2111, which may involve selling securities to meet retirement plan goals.\n\nFirms that recommend investors to sell plan assets and roll over the cash proceeds into an IRA, or buy securities for a new IRA, are subject to Rule 2011, FINRA said.\n\nDecisions involving IRAs typically entail a host of important discussions with a securities broker or a financial advisor.\n\nAdvisors need to talk to prospective and current IRA account holders about investment options, fees and expenses, various levels of service and advice, penalties for early withdrawals, legal protection from creditors, required minimum distributions and appreciation of employer stock.\n\nFINRA has made the marketing of IRA rollovers an examination priority in 2014, and warns brokers that misleading marketing materials touting \u201cno fee\u201d IRAs, or that IRAs are the best or only option for an investor, are aviolations of Rule 2210.\n\nNotice 13-45 highlights the care intermediaries must display in their marketing and sales materials.\n\n\u201cThe marketing of the IRA rollover services offered by the broker-dealer must be balanced by a discussion of other available options and how they compare to the IRA offered, particularly with regard to fees,\u201d FINRA said in its 13-45 Notice.\n\nQuestions for FINRA should be directed to Thomas M. Selman, executive vice president of regulatory policy, at (202) 728-6977, or to Angela C. Goelzer, vice president, at (202) 728-8120.\n\nCyril Tuohy is a writer based in Pennsylvania.
