Trying for the 11th steal of home in Rays\u2019 history, Jennings soared down the line, but was instead called out. LHP Dallas Keuchel moved quickly and shoveled the ball back to Corporan for a tag. Replays upheld the call of home-plate umpire Brian Knight.\n\n\u201cI was stunned, actually,\u201d Longoria said. \u201cIt kind of happened before I knew what was going on. I thought he was safe. Replay kind of looked like he was safe. If he calls him safe, he\u2019s probably (ruled) safe. He called him out and there\u2019s not enough video evidence to turn it over.\u201d\n\n\u201cI thought I was safe,\u201d Jennings said.\n\nSo did Rays manager Joe Maddon.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a great play,\u201d Maddon said. \u201cThe argument (against) is Longo was hitting (with two runners in scoring position), but they\u2019re not going to pitch to (Longoria) right there. With a 2-0 count, they might have just stood up and gone four balls (intentional walk) right there or thrown two out of the zone.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t like it (Jennings\u2019 decision), I loved it. And I thought he was safe.\u201d\n\nMaddon also was mystified by a replay call in Houston\u2019s third inning, when Jonathan Villar doubled, then was called out trying to steal third by C Jose Molina. The call was overturned by replay.\n\nMaddon said the advent of MLB\u2019s replay system will place a new premium on an old fundamental skill \u2014 tagging the base.\n\n\u201cTagging becomes even more crucial now,\u201d Maddon said. \u201cIt was always a neighborhood play and he\u2019s (called) out. Now they can actually see if he was or not.\u201d\n\nOdorizzi\u2019s gem\n\nRHP Jake Odorizzi\u2019s one-hit, 10-strikeout performance in 71\u20443 innings on Saturday continued to draw raves. He raised his strikeouts-to-innings-pitched ratio to 10.55, which ranks third among all major-league pitchers, behind Washington\u2019s Stephen Strasburg (10.89) and Texas\u2019 Yu Darvish (10.86).\n\nIf Odorizzi continues at that pace, he will be in historic company. Only three qualifying rookies in MLB history have hit that mark \u2014 Cubs RHP Kerry Wood (12.58 in 1998), Mets RHP Dwight Gooden (11.39 in 1984) and Dodgers RHP Hideo Nomo (11.10 in 1995).\n\n\u201cIt has been fun to watch him grow as a pitcher, especially since he had a rough stretch earlier in the year,\u201d Rays RHP Alex Cobb said. \u201cThat\u2019s really where you find out whether a guy can be a major-league pitcher. It\u2019s tough to handle.\n\n\u201cHe has this internal confidence that he\u2019s going to be one of the best out there every time he pitches. You need that (confidence) to be successful in this league. At times, he\u2019s almost unhittable.\u201d\n\nNot a no-no\n\nSeveral players in the Rays\u2019 clubhouse were either aghast or greatly entertained by the Tampa Tribune\u2019s front-page error about Odorizzi\u2019s outing in Sunday\u2019s editions \u2014 \u201cTampa Bay Rays rout Houston Astros in 8-0 no-hitter.\u201d\n\nLHP David Price tweeted a photo of the inaccurate headline and it was retweeted hundreds of times. Price wrote: \u201cWell the headline isn\u2019t true but if it was I hope it would be front and center and a picture of the pitcher.\u201d\n\nOdorizzi learned of the gaffe when he arrived at the clubhouse on Sunday morning.\n\n\u201cEverybody is having a good laugh about it,\u201d Odorizzi said. \u201cIt\u2019s something to talk about. I wish it was true. I\u2019m not upset about it. Obviously, somebody made a mistake. I guess it happens.\u201d\n\nOdds and ends\n\nDurant High\u2019s Chelsea Baker, the 17-year-old knuckleballer who became the first girl to pitch for a Hillsborough County baseball team, will pitch batting practice to Rays hitters this afternoon. Baker, featured on ESPN when she played for Plant City Little League, presented an autographed baseball to Maddon at last week\u2019s Sneaker Soiree. Maddon has it displayed on his desk. \u2026 After turning just one double play in the past 17 games, the Rays ended Houston\u2019s third inning with a 6-4-3 double play. Overall, the Rays have turned 38 double plays, last in the MLB. \u2026 Rays pitchers collected 13 strikeouts, increasing their MLB-leading figure to 669. \u2026 For the second time in a week, Astros CF Dexter Fowler had a leadoff home run against the Rays. Sunday, he homered on the first pitcher from LHP Erik Bedard. On June 15 at Houston, he went deep off Price to start the first inning. \u2026 RHP Joel Peralta, normally the eighth-inning specialist, recorded his first save since May 17, 2013 at Baltimore. Eighteen of his last 19 appearances have been scoreless. During that stretch, his ERA has been lowered from 7.07 to 3.58. ... Jeremy Hellickson pitched five innings for Triple-A Durham on Sunday, allowing five earned runs on eight hits with seven strikeouts. It\u2019s still possible the right-hander could be activated this week and pitch in Friday\u2019s doubleheader at Baltimore.\n\nJoey Johnston", "article_metadata": {"taboola-pub-time": "Sun, 22 Jun 2014 20:23:45 -0400", "Description": "Trying for the 11th steal of home in Rays history, Desmond Jennings soared down the line, but was instead called out.
