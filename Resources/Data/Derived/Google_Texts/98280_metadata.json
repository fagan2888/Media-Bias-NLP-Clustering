He encouraged them to begin shopping now and renew early so that coverage can begin on Jan. 1. Lee said consumers will see that the cost of some premiums of those carriers that have offered plans on the exchange will have increased by 4 percent while others have fallen.\n\nMeanwhile, Covered California is preparing for open enrollment to begin on Nov. 15 for those who want to purchase a health care plan for the first time. Enrollment will run through Dec. 15. The goal is to enroll 500,000 new insurance holders in three months, Lee said.\n\nHe admitted that would be a greater challenge than the first enrollment.\n\n\u201cConsumers will only have three months to enroll, compared with the six months they had last time,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is complicated by our knowledge that many who are uninsured have adapted to a culture of coping and have become accustomed to living without health insurance.\u201d\n\nUnder provisions of the Affordable Care Act signed by President Obama in 2010, all Americans must be covered under a health insurance plan or be penalized at tax time.\n\nThe first enrollment period was a bumpy one for both states that opened their own health insurance exchanges and for the federal government.\n\nBut Lee said many lessons were learned from those first six months.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t do everything perfectly,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re taking those lessons and applying them to open enrollment.\u201d\n\nAmong those improvements are an increase in representatives to handle calls. Consumers waited too long, Lee said. This time, 1,300 representatives will be on phones, and there will be those who can offer help in Spanish, Mandarin, and Korean among other languages. When open enrollment launched last year, there were fewer than 400 representatives, which overwhelmed the system.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn addition, most technical glitches with the website have been worked out, but the website will be down on Sundays for the next few weeks, Lee said.\n\nThere also will be certified representative at 200 storefronts across California, improving what Lee called that one-on-one relationship that so many people needed during last enrollment. He also said more resources would be spent to reach out to the Latino, African-American and Asian communities.\n\nThose who have health coverage through Medi-Cal can renew their coverage throughout year, on a rolling monthly schedule, and Medi-Cal will contact them directly.\n\n\u201cWe are extremely excited about the changes we have put in place, and we look forward to building on the enthusiasm around open enrollment this year as we did last year,\u201d Lee said.\n\n\u201cAt the same time, we know we have more work to do. We want Covered California to deliver best-in-class customer service, and we know we\u2019re not there yet. But we\u2019re getting better every week, and we will continue to learn and improve.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "More than 1.1 million Californians who signed up for Obamacare plans through the state\u2019s health insurance exchange will begin to receive renewal notices and can start testing an improved online system, officials said Thursday.\u201cThi", "title": "Covered California begins health insurance renewals for more than 1 million people", "og": {"url": "http://www.dailynews.com/government-and-politics/20141016/covered-california-begins-health-insurance-renewals-for-more-than-1-million-people", "image": {"width": "512px", "identifier": "http://local.dailynews.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/small/dailynews_new.png", "height": "512px"}, "type": "article", "title": "Covered California begins health insurance renewals for more than 1 million people"}, "twitter": {"domain": "dailynews.com", "description": "More than 1.1 million Californians who signed up for Obamacare plans through the state\u2019s health insurance exchange will begin to receive renewal notices and can start testing an improved online system, officials said Thursday.\u201cThi", "title": "Covered California begins health insurance renewals for more than 1 million people", "url": "http://www.dailynews.com/government-and-politics/20141016/covered-california-begins-health-insurance-renewals-for-more-than-1-million-people", "image": {"src": "http://local.dailynews.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/small/dailynews.png?052016"}, "site": "@ladailynews", "app": {"id": {"ipad": "id551745144", "iphone": "id502957174", "googleplay": "com.spreedinc.providers.digitalfirstmedia.ladailynews"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "keywords": "Affordable Care Act, Affordable Care Act news, Los Angeles Affordable Care Act news, CA Affordable Care Act news, US Affordable Care Act news, world Affordable Care Act news.", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Affordable Care Act, Affordable Care Act news, Los Angeles Affordable Care Act news, CA Affordable Care Act news, US Affordable Care Act news, world Affordable Care Act news."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdfe16\"", "article_summary": "We want Covered California to deliver best-in-class customer service, and we know we\u2019re not there yet.\nMeanwhile, Covered California is preparing for open enrollment to begin on Nov. 15 for those who want to purchase a health care plan for the first time.\nThe first enrollment period was a bumpy one for both states that opened their own health insurance exchanges and for the federal government.\nDuring the first enrollment period, which lasted six months, consumers chose health plans based on the metal plans: Bronze, Silver, Gold or Platinum level of coverages.\nWhen open enrollment launched last year, there were fewer than 400 representatives, which overwhelmed the system."}
