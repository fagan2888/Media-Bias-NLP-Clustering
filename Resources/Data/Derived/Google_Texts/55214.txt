We in New Jersey's 7th Congressional district have been fortunate to have Leonard Lance represent us for four terms. As chairman of the Bernardsville Republican Committee, I know what he has accomplished for his constituents.

He has stood up for Republican principles, especially the defunding of Obamacare. He's been a leader in trying to stop President Obama's lawless executive actions.

He auhored the Balanced Budget Amendment that would force the federal government to live within its means without raising taxes.

Many times he has broken from the GOP leadership on ill-conceived fiscal issues. He voted against the 2015 Obama/Boehner budget deal filled with wasteful spending and crony capitalist giveaways. That takes guts.

Lance is endorsed by leading business groups, championing policies that encourage economic growth, job creation and less intrusion by the government. He supported the Keystone pipeline bill and opposes the administration's cap and trade regulatory attack on affordable, reliable electricity.

He has called for greater efforts to defeat ISIS, including closing dangerous loopholes in our visa programs, especially those dealing with foreign nationals from Syria and Iraq. He has advocated fixing America's immigration system, beginning with securing our border, enforcing immigration laws on the books, and implementing visa tracking systems. He voted to strip funding for executive amnesty, end sanctuary cities and restore the rule of law.

As co-chairman of the Republican Israel Caucus he has been a leading opponent of the president's dangerous nuclear deal with Iran.

Lance deserves our support in the June 7th GOP primary.
