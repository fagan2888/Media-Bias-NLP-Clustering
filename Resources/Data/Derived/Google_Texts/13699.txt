Former S.C. Rep. John Graham Altman (RINO-Charleston) was hospitalized last week while his wife – S.C. Federation of Republican Women (SCFRW) president Charm Altman – hobnobbed with her fellow Republican biddies at a national conference in Louisville, Kentucky.

In fact the former state lawmaker’s condition has some of his former colleagues alleging “elder abuse.”

“He had been laying on the couch since last November,” a source familiar with the situation tells FITS.

Political associates of the Altmans’ were horrified. Even those who sparred with the cantankerous legislator in the past lamented his sorry state – and were shocked by his wife’s poor treatment of him.

“She had to put him in there before she could leave for Kentucky,” one source tells us.

Another slammed Charm Altman saying her husband “would have gotten better treatment from an Obamacare death panel.”

Ouch …

John Graham Altman, 79, was press secretary to Democratic Gov. Fritz Hollings from 1959-1963. He served five terms in the S.C. House of Representatives from 1997-2007 as a “Republican.”
