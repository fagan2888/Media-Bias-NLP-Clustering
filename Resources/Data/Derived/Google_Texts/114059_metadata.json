It expands upon Thiel\u2019s National Review piece, but draws more directly from the notes of Blake Masters, his student at Stanford University. Thiel\u2019s thesis is a call to action: \u201cDoing what we already know how to do takes the world from 1 to n, adding more of something familiar \u2026 but every time we create something knew, we go from 0 to 1.\u201d Such innovation is, to Thiel, the source of all progress.\n\nHis book is a breezy, quick read, full of visuals and references that mostly enhance Thiel\u2019s argument rather than distract. In the book\u2019s second half, devoted to \u201cNotes on Startups,\u201d Thiel is at his best. Drawing from his own venture capital, entrepreneurship, and start-up successes\u2014such as being Facebook\u2019s first outside investor\u2014he provides helpful advice for aspiring businessmen.\n\nEven though Thiel stresses that he provides no company-specific answers, would-be start-up founders will profit from his advice on the importance of a dedicated founder, a promising idea, and a founding team that collaborates well, as well as from his wisdom on equity and sales. Nor should they reject Thiel\u2019s unorthodox belief that, because they abound in the aforementioned qualities, \u201cthe best startups might be considered slightly less extreme kinds of cults.\u201d\n\nBut Thiel\u2019s unorthodoxy sometimes fails to convince. His contention that \u201ccompetition and capitalism are opposites\u201d stands out as questionable. To him, businesses only have consequential success to the extent that they offer something no one else can: \u201cThe history of progress is a history of better monopoly businesses replacing incumbents.\u201d\n\nTo reach this conclusion, Thiel rejects out of hand the benefits that decades of economic literature have assigned to competitive markets. He also derides competition. If forced to compete, Thiel writes, \u201ceither you don\u2019t throw any punches, or strike hard and end it quickly.\u201d What if it doesn\u2019t end quickly?\n\nAnd even if, to Thiel, progress comes from new monopolies replacing incumbents, certain incumbents are apparently immortal. Twitter lacks an \u201cinherent reason why it should ever stop growing\u201d; a new firm could never bury Google as it buried its past competitors. In short, competition is irrelevant. The future alone matters.\n\nYet for a book about the future, Thiel is coyly vague about what he thinks it holds. He gives glimpses throughout, and then merely categorizes his vagueness in terms of progress\u2014roughly: cyclical, plateauing, catastrophic, and utopic\u2014and indicates his preference (the last one). He is more comfortable explaining past mistakes with hindsight. But between scattered utopian calls for underwater cities, space colonization, and universal panaceas, and offhand comments about the prominence of Silicon Valley in the new economy, one gets a measure of Thiel\u2019s desired future: a world refashioned in the Valley\u2019s image, bestrode by its giants and by those who have adopted its mores.\n\nBut the world beyond the valley remains different from what lies within. This is why some of Zero to One makes sense, while the rest seems so artificially unconventional. Thiel\u2019s book may provide practical counsel for other innovators in and out of the Valley, but his contrived edginess masks his tacit agreement with other Silicon Valley supremacists who, as the Weekly Standard\u2019s Charlotte Allen detailed in \u201cSilicon Chasm,\u201d will likely profit in this future at others\u2019 expense. Anybody uncomfortable with a silicon world ought to be wary not just of Thiel\u2019s worldview, but also of the future he wants to realize.", "article_metadata": {"description": "In 2011, Peter Thiel, co-founder of PayPal and Palantir Technologies, worried that the future might be over.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Free Beacon", "description": "In 2011, Peter Thiel, co-founder of PayPal and Palantir Technologies, worried that the future might be over.
