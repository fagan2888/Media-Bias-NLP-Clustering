(Just ask Dr. Ben Carson after he spoke out against Obamacare at the National Prayer Breakfast earlier this year.)\n\nBesides a general caption, feel free to write \"thought bubbles\" for the poster and the man walking by.\n\nLittle poems are also encouraged like this one I could not resist:\n\nNo more hope or change?\n\nIt\u2019s such a darn shame\n\nbut all you Dems must take the blame\n\ncuz the GOP knew back in '08 that his slogan was insane.\n\nFor the only slogan he ever needed was \"blame Bush\"\n\nand the results would have been the same.", "article_metadata": {"page-title": "New Photo Caption Contest: Hope and Change Morphs Into Shame | PJ Media", "title": "New Photo Caption Contest: Hope and Change Morphs Into Shame | PJ Media", "og": {"site_name": "PJ Media", "description": "It's a Sham.
