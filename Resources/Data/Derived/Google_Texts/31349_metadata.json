So is Supreme Court justice a natural next step for him?\n\nWith the recent midterm results and his equally disastrous poll numbers, it\u2019s hard to believe that President Obama hasn\u2019t at least daydreamed about having another less demanding, less thankless job. And with two Supreme Court decisions on the horizon that could undo some of his most significant presidential legacies, it is even harder to believe he hasn\u2019t daydreamed about one job in particular: being a Supreme Court Justice.\n\nHis clashes with Congress and increasing isolation seem to make it abundantly clear that President Barack Obama would rather play just about any game\u2014including, or perhaps especially, golf\u2014than politics. Yet he happens to have picked a line of work in which playing politics, or politicking as some call it, is just as much a part of the job requirements, as signing, or vetoing, a piece of legislation. So would President Barack Obama have been happier on the nation\u2019s highest court than in the nation\u2019s most recognizable house?\n\n\u201cI love the law, intellectually,\u201d Obama said in a recent interview with The New Yorker, before saying \u201cbeing a Justice is a little bit too monastic for me.\u201d And yet that doesn\u2019t change the fact that he might have ultimately had a greater impact on the issues he cares about as a member of the Supreme Court\u2014and that being a justice might be a more natural fit with who he is as a person.\n\nEvery president hopes to have at least one signature accomplishment or issue his administration can be remembered for. President Obama was poised to have two: healthcare reform and significant advancement on LGBT rights, specifically same-sex marriage. But after a surprising vote from Chief Justice John Roberts seemed to give the Affordable Care Act a reprieve in 2012, the Court is now planning to review another key portion of the law, with a ruling scheduled to come down by June 2015. That ruling could leave millions of those currently benefiting from Obamacare without the necessary subsidies to stay insured, and set the groundwork for a larger dismantling of the law.\n\nLast week, the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld bans on same sex marriage in four states, making it extremely likely the Supreme Court will soon decide that issue as well. From becoming the first sitting President to embrace same-sex marriage, to repealing \u201cDon\u2019t Ask, Don\u2019t Tell\u201d, to using executive action to extend a host of federal benefits to same-sex couples, there are few issues that the Obama administration has been as heavily invested in terms of the President\u2019s political capital than LGBT rights.\n\nAnd yet, ultimately, the Supreme Court holds the power to uphold or undo what it has taken him years to accomplish.\n\nIt certainly cannot be an easy pill to swallow, working so hard to get to the White House only to find out that, despite what everyone tells all of us from the time we are children, the president actually isn\u2019t the most powerful man in America. That title belongs to nine men and women who were not elected but whose word is, for lack of a better term, king.\n\nBut perhaps even more daunting for the President, and his supporters, is the fact that one of the greatest orators to ever occupy the White House seems to lack the personality for the job.\n\nLet me be clear, as the president would say: Obama is telegenic and charming. (In one of the moments I chatted briefly with him he made a quip about my work that my mother still quotes to this day.) But it is clear he is not a man who is interested in having beers with people he is not genuinely interested in interacting with. He is the guy who hates small talk at large parties solely for the sake of networking, but would probably talk the ear off of a writer he admires at a small dinner party. That personality is not conducive to getting things done in Washington, at least not the Washington of today.\n\nIn his book The Center Holds: Obama and his Enemies, Jonathan Alter devotes an entire chapter to the president\u2019s lack of love for one of politics\u2019 most cherished pastimes: schmoozing. \u201cNo doubt President Obama is definitely less comfortable schmoozing than President Clinton was,\u201d Keith Boykin, a CNBC Contributor who worked in the Clinton White House and was a law school classmate of President Obama\u2019s told me. But he also added, \u201cFrom my recollection in the Clinton administration, the White House can be very isolating for any president, even those who are very sociable by nature.\u201d\n\nDespite Obama\u2019s schmooze-aversion, Alter argues that the president\u2019s own record indicates he might not fare quite so comfortably on the Supreme Court. Alter noted that during his days as a law professor at the University of Chicago, \u201cInstead of settling in as a professor\u2014and he could have easily won tenure\u2014he chose to stay a part-time lecturer so he could run for elective office and be a politician. During that time, he didn\u2019t write a single scholarly law review article, only political pieces or book reviews for local publications.\u201d\n\nHe also said the President disliked being 1 of 100 in the Senate, and would go batty \u201cbeing cooped up in the Supreme Court, which is a bad place for a restless guy like him.\u201d\n\nAlthough it\u2019s not beyond the realm of possibility that he could one day have a chance to find out how Obama would fair as a Justice. And there is a precedent: William Howard Taft became Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court eight years after failing to be re-elected to a second term as president.\n\n\u201cI think President Obama would make an excellent Supreme Court justice,\u201d Boykin said. \u201cIt\u2019s not too late. He\u2019s still a relatively young man in judicial terms and could follow in the tradition of William Howard Taft. President Hillary Clinton could appoint him to the Supreme Court if she wanted to do so.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"twitter": {"site": "@thedailybeast", "card": "summary", "creator": "keligoff"}, "keywords": "u.s. poli", "publicationDate": 201411171045, "wrap": "/content/dailybeast/politics", "description": "The president has always given off the sense that he doesn\u2019t love the business of politics.
