Recognizing the need for a simple way to shop for health insurance plans, HealthPlans.com started working with the nation's top health plans and online brokers to help them direct market to consumers.\n\n\"The introduction of Obamacare has changed everything in our health care system,\" said Patrick Quigley, CEO, Katch. \"One of the most important changes is that carriers must now market plans directly to consumers, and we are experts at enabling plans to put the right message in front of the right consumer, while they are shopping.\"\n\nHealthPlans.com's revenue has grown steadily over the past few years, more than doubling from 2012 to 2015. The business credits its tremendous growth to its approach to monetization. Unlike other companies who also help carriers reach consumers, like eHealth or GoHealth, HealthPlans.com is paid for making the connection, rather than by selling policies.\n\n\"Monetizing our media translates to a growing, sustainable business that we will continue to scale rapidly as more and more individuals look to purchase health insurance,\" Quigley said. \"We have heard from multiple national health plans that have reallocated budgets away from Google and over to HealthPlans.com because it's a more efficient way to reach in-market consumers.\"\n\nQuigley will be presenting HealthPlans.com at the Montgomery Summit on Tuesday, March 10th at 5 p.m. in the Wedgewood conference room. HealthPlans.com is also sponsoring the keynote interview from with Patrick Soon-Shiong, the world-renown doctor, medical researcher, philanthropist, and CEO of four health care companies. He is most popular for his disruptive approaches to cancer treatments and overall health care.\n\nAbout HealthPlans.com\n\nHealthPlans.com is one of the most visited independent consumer health Insurance sites, according to comScore. With the ACA disrupting the health care system in the U.S. for consumers and health insurance providers alike, a critical solution that involves reaching and educating consumers with options is needed. HealthPlans.com helps consumers make sense of all things health insurance through relevant news, expert advice, and interactive tools, and matches them to a health insurance plan that meets their needs.\n\nAbout the Montgomery Summit\n\nThe Montgomery Summit gathers a highly selective group of senior-level investors and top executives from private growth technology companies for two days of exciting events and presentations in Santa Monica, Calif.
