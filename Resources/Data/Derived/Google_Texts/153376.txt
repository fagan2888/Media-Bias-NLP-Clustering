Police say a man suspected of shooting three people in church was likely upset over a recent breakup and visitation issues with his son.

Selma police Lt. Curtis Muhannad says 26-year-old James Junior Minter is being held without bond in the shooting of his 24-year-old former girlfriend, his 1-month-old-son and the 61-year-old pastor, Earl Carswell, who tried intervening Sunday morning. Minter opened fire during church service at Oasis Tabernacle Church in East Selma, Alabama.

Muhannad says Minter had been arrested before but details on the nature of his past encounters with police weren't immediately available.

Muhannad says authorities are also investigating whether Minter violated a protective order.

Minter has been charged with three counts of attempted murder.

An Alabama prosecutor says a suspect has been charged with attempted murder after allegedly shooting a woman, an infant and a pastor inside a church in Alabama.

Dallas County District Attorney Michael Jackson says James Minter was arrested after the shooting Sunday at the Oasis Church in East Selma, Alabama. Neither Minter's age or hometown were immediately available.

Jackson says the shooting stems from a domestic issue between Minter and the woman and that race was not a factor.

Jackson says the pastor is white, while Minter and the two other victims are black. Jackson says Minter is being held without bond at the Dallas County jail.
