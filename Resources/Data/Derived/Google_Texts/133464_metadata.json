Not only family doctors but internists, geriatricians, all those involved with primary care,\u201d Zehnder said.\n\nLocal doctors are optimistic things will change. The University of Utah\u2019s School of Medicine has increased its enrollment at the 50 percent.\n\nIn 2013 The Legislature passed a bill that gives $10 million in ongoing funding to expand the medical school class from 82 students to 102. In 2014 the school added 20 more students.\n\n\"We have far more qualified applicants than we do actual positions and so thanks to the Legislature and the infusion of cash we were able to increase our class size by 122. Research has shown that where a medical student goes to college they are more likely to practice medicine there,\u201d said Benjamin Chan Asst. Dean of Admissions at the University of Utah School of Medicine.\n\nWhether the medical students choose to practice primary care is a different issue. Historically primary care has been one of the lower paying professions for doctors.\n\nIn a survey by the medical group Management Association, the median salary for an orthopedic surgeon was more than $500,000. The median salary for a primary care physician was little more than $200,000.\n\n\u201cFor those who truly want to become a primary care doctor it is difficult because you come out of training with a significant amount of debt and you want to pay that off, you want to start your own family and make a difference -- but it\u2019s difficult to do that when you choose a specialty that doesn\u2019t pay as well as another specialty might,\u201d Zehnder said.\n\nMatthew Petersen is a first-year medical student at the University of Utah. He is a part of one of the largest classes the school has ever accepted.\n\n\"I have a number of friends who are at other schools who are paying out-of-state tuition or who are at private schools who say \u2018yeah I love primary care or am interested in exploring primary care, but I can't. I can't afford to explore primary care,\u201d Petersen said.\n\nPetersen's debt will be below average since he's only paying in-state tuition, which at the U comes to about $35,000 a year. Because of this, he says he's more likely to go after a field that he's passionate about rather than one that pays his loans off the quickest.\n\n\u201cThat allows more people to explore more and more just what they're interested in and not have to worry so much about the financial side of things and it creates a really unique dynamic with in our class,\u201d Petersen said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "SALT LAKE CITY -- Hospitals and clinics across the country are reporting doctor shortages, including here in Utah.
