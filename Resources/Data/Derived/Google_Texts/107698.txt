WALDOBORO, Maine — Two teenage boys were injured Friday night after being struck by a box truck on Union Road.

The two boys, ages 14 and 15, were apparently stopped on their bicycles talking to pedestrians in the southbound lane near 603 Union Road when a 2001 Mitsubishi refrigerated box truck struck the bike ridden by the older teen, who was thrown off the bike and landed on the shoulder of the road, according to a release from the Waldoboro Police Department.

Police believe the older teen’s bike then struck the younger teen.

The 15-year-old was taken by Lifeflight of Maine to Central Maine Medical Center with what police described as serious head injuries.

The 14-year-old suffered a leg injury and was first taken to Miles Memorial Hospital in Damariscotta, then transferred to an unidentified Portland hospital.

The boys’ names were not released on Saturday and their conditions were not available.

The driver of the box truck, 24-year-old Joseph E. Benedix of Waldoboro, told police he didn’t see the boys in the road until he was almost upon them. He said he tried to swerve around the bikes but struck the bike closest to the center line.

The truck was registered to Simmons Lobster Wharf Inc. of Friendship.

Neither pedestrian was injured. According to police, neither boy was wearing a bike helmet.

The Lincoln County Sheriff’s Office is reconstructing the accident, and the Maine State Police were called to examine the truck. The investigation is ongoing.
