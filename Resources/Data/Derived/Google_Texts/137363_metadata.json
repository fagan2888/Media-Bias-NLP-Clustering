Two all-beef patties, special sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles, onions -- on a sesame-seed bun. While it might not be the best tasting burger in the world, at least in my opinion, it is the signature sandwich of McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD). The company sells a lot of them. In fact, McDonald's estimates that it sells around 550 million Big Macs in the U.S. alone. Let's look at the impact of the Big Mac.\n\nWalking the extra mile, or nine and a half\n\nMcDonald's stuffs a lot into each of its signature burgers. The 7.6-ounce serving size packs about 540 calories. That's greater than the average fast-food item, while the 45 grams of carbohydrates is about average. The Big Mac is also heavier on the sodium than most fast-food items, but it also packs a lot of protein, calcium, and iron.\n\nThe Big Mac is sure to fill up the hungriest of guests, though it might be a little too filling. Its calories have the energy equivalent of providing enough energy for the average person to walk for 167 minutes. We'd need to leave a lot of footprints just to burn off that one burger. But again, that's just that one burger. Add in the fries and splurge on a milk shake, and then we're up to 1,411 calories. That meal, according to nutritionists in the U.K., would require a nine-and-a-half-mile walk to burn off all of the calories.\n\nThose physical footprints, however, aren't the only ones made by a McDonald's Big Mac.\n\nCarbon footprints\n\nThe two 1.6-ounce all-beef patties have an identifiable carbon footprint -- or, should I say, hoof print -- according to the Meat Eater's Guide to Climate Change and Health. Cows produce a lot of greenhouse gases as part of their digestive process. That process, called enteric fermentation, produces methane, which is a greenhouse gas that's 25 times more potent than carbon dioxide. Beef products and cheese thus have a higher carbon footprint than most other foods we eat.\n\nThe Meat Eater's Guide puts the carbon footprint of the roughly 4 ounces of beef and cheese that are found in one Big Mac as the equivalent of driving a car more than 6 miles.That's just one Big Mac. Add up McDonald's total Big Mac sales in just the U.S., and we're talking about the carbon footprint equivalent of driving a car 3.3 billion miles.\n\nFood for thought\n\nIn weighing all of our food options, a Big Mac isn't the best choice we can make for our bodies or the environment. A chicken-based meal, on the other hand, is far healthier, while also producing half the emissions. This isn't to say we need to put an end to the Big Mac, or burgers in general. We just might want to walk an extra mile -- or 6 -- after consuming one.", "article_metadata": {"publish_time": "14:15", "date": "2014-02-16T19:15:00Z", "description": "Why you really need to walk off your next Big Mac.", "ResponsiveALP": "1Ses_control-21_control_100", "author": "Matthew DiLallo", "promo": "Why you really need to walk off your next Big Mac.", "twitter": {"site": "@themotleyfool", "description": "Why you really need to walk off your next Big Mac.", "title": "This Is Why We Go the Extra Mile for a McDonald's Big Mac --  The Motley Fool"}, "pitch": 447, "og": {"site_name": "The Motley Fool", "description": "Why you really need to walk off your next Big Mac.", "title": "This Is Why We Go the Extra Mile for a McDonald's Big Mac --  The Motley Fool", "url": "http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2014/02/16/this-is-why-we-go-the-extra-mile-for-a-mcdonalds-b.aspx", "image": "https://g.foolcdn.com/image/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fg.foolcdn.com%2Feditorial%2Fimages%2F102622%2Fmcdonalds-big-mac.jpg&h=630&w=1200&op=resize", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 50808187550, "page_id": 7240312795, "app_id": 50808187550}, "bureau": "usmf-energy-materials-and-utilities", "STORY_UID": "eceb0acc-9260-11e3-ba35-0050569d4be0", "headline": "This Is Why We Go the Extra Mile for a McDonald's Big Mac", "msvalidate.01": "8D40D58712924715BAA79D135A6C8DDA", "gsa_date": "2014 02 16", "tickers": "MCD", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd43fd\"", "article_summary": "Those physical footprints, however, aren't the only ones made by a McDonald's Big Mac.\nThis isn't to say we need to put an end to the Big Mac, or burgers in general.\nThe Big Mac is sure to fill up the hungriest of guests, though it might be a little too filling.\nThe Big Mac.\nAdd up McDonald's total Big Mac sales in just the U.S., and we're talking about the carbon footprint equivalent of driving a car 3.3 billion miles."}
