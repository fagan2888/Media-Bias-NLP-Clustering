This year has been one of change again for the World.\n\nWhile we have had staff fluctuations, I remain as news editor, Joe Warren is managing editor/publisher of both the Hiawatha World and Atchison Globe, Craig Miller is a sports and news reporter and Dona Ploeger is our front office assistant.\n\nMelissa Gibson left for another job in October and her position as ad executive is being handled from our Atchison office for the time being.\n\nThe biggest change was a sign of the economic times in a small community. Our newspaper transitioned from twice a week to a weekly, printed on Wednesday. Our weekly edition offers as much news as our two issues a weekly combined, but unfortunately timeliness suffers when this happens. We also revamped our Website, which is offered to subscribers, and are pleased to say it offers news updated daily and is easy for our subscribers to navigate and find the news they want.\n\nWe look forward to continued service to our community and appreciate your support.\n\n2013 Year in Review\n\nJan. 1: Influenza hits earlier than expected, according to Hiawatha Community Hospital;
