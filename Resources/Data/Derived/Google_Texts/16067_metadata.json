The Bears' season came to an end in a 4-3 loss. (Republican Eagle photo by Joe Brown)\n\nBELLE PLAINE, Minn. \u2013 As Taylor Pagel headed to second base with a bases-loaded double, he thought there was new life for Cannon Falls.\n\nDown 4-1 heading into the eighth inning, Pagel brought home Nate Otto and Brandon Voth, and Rich Burr slid head-first into home, trying to tie Saturday\u2019s Class C state playoff opener against Nisswa.\n\nAs the dust settled on the slide, Burr was called out, much to the chagrin Pagel and the rest of the Bears\u2019 bench.\n\n\u201cI got to second and I got to see that whole play at home and he was safe,\u201d Pagel said. \u201cHe was definitely safe. And that\u2019s a bummer when the ump takes the game away from you.\u201d\n\nWith Cannon Falls\u2019 comeback hopes deflated, Nisswa moved on with a 4-3 victory at Tiger Park in Belle Plaine, Minnesota.\n\nWhile the call at home plate was the definitive moment of the game, the Bears did themselves no favors with five errors while the Lightning was perfect in the field.\n\n\u201cThey made every play,\u201d said Cannon Falls starting pitcher/manager Keith Meyers. \u201cEvery play we hit at them, they made it, and we were just the opposite.\u201d\n\nNisswa\u2019s leadoff hitter in the third, Brett Jenkins, got on after an error at shortstop. Two batters later, Aaron Jenkins belted an RBI double down the right-field line to put the Lightning up 1-0. Then with two outs in the fourth, a throwing error at second base allowed Drew Bowen, making it a 2-0 advantage.\n\n\u201cSmall things affected us,\u201d said Pagel, Cannon Falls\u2019 catcher. \u201cI should have backed up that throw when (second baseman Jamie) Stay made that nice play and he threw it away. I hesitated there.\u201d\n\nPagel (2-for-4) redeemed himself with an RBI double to left field that scored Burr as part of a four-hit bottom of the fourth.\n\nAfter enduring four errors in the first four innings, the Bears were able to settle down thanks to Meyers\u2019 performance on the mound. Bulldogging his way through eight innings, Meyers struck out eight without giving up a walk.\n\n\u201cHe calmed down and started hitting his spots,\u201d Pagel said of Meyers\u2019 performance on the mound.\n\nMeyers\u2019 one mistake on the mound came on a high changeup that Jenkins drove over the left-field wall for a two-run home run in the seventh that made it 4-1.\n\n\u201cKeith missed on a changeup up, and that was the game right there,\u201d Pagel said.\n\nMeyers led the top of the eighth off with a single, but was thrown out as part of a Nisswa double play. The Bears were undeterred as Otto (3-for-3, 2B), Voth (1-for-4) and Burr (2-for-4) hit three consecutive singles to get Pagel up for the bases-loaded opportunity that ultimately fell just short.\n\nWith one more chance for Cannon Falls to tie it up in the ninth, the Lightning\u2019s Jason Roepke put the finishing touches on a complete game by getting three straight outs. Roepke struck out five while giving up 11 hits, three runs and two walks.\n\nWith the win, Nisswa will face the Region 5A winner, Waseca, on Aug. 23 back in Belle Plaine.\n\nCannon Falls (23-17) disagreed with the call at the plate, but the game was ultimately decided over nine innings instead of just one play.\n\n\u201cIt should have never been that way,\u201d Meyers said. \u201cWe game \u2018em a couple early, then I gave them a couple late.\n\nMeyers continued, \u201cWe hit the ball, we just couldn\u2019t do more than that. That\u2019s the way the state tournament is; you have to come up with some clutch two-out hitting and play defense and we didn\u2019t do that.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "sports,amateur,Baseball,cannon falls bears", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Joe Brown", "og": {"site_name": "Republican Eagle", "description": "BELLE PLAINE, Minn. \u2013 As Taylor Pagel headed to second base with a bases-loaded double, he thought there was new life for Cannon Falls.\r\n\r\nDown 4-1 heading into the eighth inning, Pagel brought home Nate Otto and Brandon Voth, and Rich Burr slid head-first into home, trying to tie Saturday\u2019s Cla...", "title": "Amateur Baseball: Bears stopped by Nisswa", "url": "http://www.republican-eagle.com/content/amateur-baseball-bears-stopped-nisswa", "image": {"width": 300, "identifier": "http://www.republican-eagle.com/sites/default/files/styles/square_300/public/field/image/Rich%20Burr_0.jpg?itok=futrY5_H", "height": 300}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "BELLE PLAINE, Minn. \u2013 As Taylor Pagel headed to second base with a bases-loaded double, he thought there was new life for Cannon Falls.\r\n\r\nDown 4-1 heading into the eighth inning, Pagel brought home Nate Otto and Brandon Voth, and Rich Burr slid head-first into home, trying to tie Saturday\u2019s Cla...", "title": "Amateur Baseball: Bears stopped by Nisswa", "url": "http://www.republican-eagle.com/content/amateur-baseball-bears-stopped-nisswa", "image": "http://www.republican-eagle.com/sites/default/files/styles/16x9_430/public/field/image/Rich%20Burr_0.jpg?itok=c9puoHDw", "site": "republicaneagle", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 243322109167890}, "keywords": "sports,amateur,Baseball,cannon falls bears", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/redwingrepublicaneagle", "tag": "sports,amateur,Baseball,cannon falls bears", "modified_time": "2014-08-17T21:44:00-05:00"}, "image": {"alt": "Cannon Falls third baseman Rich Burr makes a throw to first during Saturday's Class C state amateur baseball game against Nisswa in Belle Plaine.
