American families reunited. The third piece of this work that we got done this weekend involved the United States and Iran resolving a financial dispute that dated back more than three decades. Since 1981, after our nations severed diplomatic relations, we\u2019ve worked through a international tribunal to resolve various claims between our countries. The United States and Iran are now settling a longstanding Iranian government claim against the United States government. Iran will be returned its own funds, including appropriate interest, but much less than the amount Iran sought,\" Obama said.\n\nThat payout to Iran from the United States? $1.7 billion.\n\nSecretary of State John Kerry said today that the settlement is $400 million debt and $1.3 billion in interest dating back to the Islamic revolution. That's separate from the sanctions windfall Iran will receive.\n\n\"For the United States, this settlement could save us billions of dollars that could have been pursued by Iran,\" Obama claimed. \"So there was no benefit to the United States in dragging this out. With the nuclear deal done, prisoners released, the time was right to resolve this dispute as well.\"\n\nThe president then acknowledged a bit of Iran's other bad behavior, such as \"a violation of its international obligations\" with illegal ballistic missile tests.", "article_metadata": {"page-title": "Cherry on Top: Iran to Get $1.7 Billion Settlement from U.S. in Addition to Sanctions Relief", "pinterest": "nopin", "og": {"site_name": "News and Politics", "description": "Obama claims settlement 'could save us billions of dollars that could have been pursued by Iran.'", "title": "Cherry on Top: Iran to Get $1.7 Billion Settlement from U.S. in Addition to Sanctions Relief", "url": "https://pjmedia.com/news-and-politics/2016/01/17/cherry-on-top-iran-to-get-1-7-billion-settlement-from-u-s-in-addition-to-sanctions-relief/", "image": "https://pajamasmed.hs.llnwd.net/e1/news-and-politics/user-content/50/files/2016/01/AP_336523169796.sized-770x415xc.jpg", "updated_time": 1464310103, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Obama claims settlement 'could save us billions of dollars that could have been pursued by Iran.'", "title": "Cherry on Top: Iran to Get $1.7 Billion Settlement from U.S. in Addition to Sanctions Relief", "url": "https://pjmedia.com/news-and-politics/2016/01/17/cherry-on-top-iran-to-get-1-7-billion-settlement-from-u-s-in-addition-to-sanctions-relief/", "image": "https://pajamasmed.hs.llnwd.net/e1/news-and-politics/user-content/50/files/2016/01/AP_336523169796.sized-770x415xc.jpg", "site": "@PJMedia_com", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Cherry on Top: Iran to Get $1.7 Billion Settlement from U.S. in Addition to Sanctions Relief", "pinterestDescription": "Cherry on Top: Iran to Get $1.7 Billion Settlement from U.S. in Addition to Sanctions Relief", "fb": {"app_id": 149848758413844}, "keywords": "president obama, iran, iran nuclear deal, iran hostages, john kerry", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "The United States and Iran are now settling a longstanding Iranian government claim against the United States government.\nCherry on Top: Iran to Get $1.7 Billion Settlement from U.S. in Addition to Sanctions ReliefCherry on Top: Iran to Get $1.7 Billion Settlement from U.S. in Addition to Sanctions ReliefPresident Obama today declared at the White House that \"Iran will not get its hands on a nuclear bomb\" and that their \"tireless\" negotiations paid off with several American hostages coming home.\n\"For the United States, this settlement could save us billions of dollars that could have been pursued by Iran,\" Obama claimed.\nWith the nuclear deal done, prisoners released, the time was right to resolve this dispute as well.\"\n\"So there was no benefit to the United States in dragging this out."}
