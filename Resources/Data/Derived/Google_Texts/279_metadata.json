Her attorneys say tubal ligation is safest when performed immediately after a birth.\n\nThe lawsuit is part of a growing clash over birth control and abortion health care coverage. Dozens of U.S. Roman Catholic dioceses, charities and colleges have sued in federal court over the contraceptive coverage required under the federal Affordable Care Act.\n\nSeveral evangelical nonprofits have also sued, arguing some of the birth control methods covered under the law are tantamount to abortion.\n\nElizabeth Gill, an American Civil Liberties Union attorney representing Chamorro, said her lawsuit would continue, though Chamorro would likely have to undergo the cesarean section without getting a tubal ligation at Mercy Medical, her closest delivery option.\n\n\u201cWe disagree with the court about what California law requires,\u201d Gill said. \u201cThis is a real issue about women\u2019s health.\u201d\n\nHealth care provider Dignity Health, which operates Mercy Medical and 38 other hospitals in California, Nevada and Arizona, says the tubal ligation sought by Chamorro is not medically necessary and would violate the hospital\u2019s right to freedom of religion.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no law \u2026 that would support this kind of intrusion on a Catholic hospitals observance of ethical and religious directives,\u201d Barry Landsberg, an attorney representing Dignity Health, told the judge on Thursday.\n\nLast June, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the Hobby Lobby chain and other closely held private businesses with religious objections could opt out of the birth control mandate in the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe ACLU has also filed a complaint with a state agency against a Michigan Catholic hospital that also refused to perform a tubal ligation, according to Brigitte Amiri, a senior staff attorney with the ACLU. She said the woman in that case was able to go to another hospital. The complaint is pending.\n\nChamorro\u2019s attorneys say Chamorro has no choice but to use Mercy Medical Center for the delivery of her child because Redding is about 200 miles north of San Francisco and the next closest hospital she could use is more than 70 miles away.\n\nThe lawsuit accuses Dignity Health of violating California laws against sex discrimination and the practice of medicine by corporations, pointing out that Chamorro\u2019s obstetrician had sought permission from Mercy Medical to perform the procedure.\n\nThe ACLU says the hospital allowed another woman to undergo a tubal ligation after the ACLU threatened a lawsuit and that the medical center was illegally restricting Chamorro for non-medical reasons.\n\nThe hospital\u2019s attorney acknowledged other tubal ligations had been allowed but said they were evaluated on a case-by-case basis in accordance with the hospital\u2019s religious policies. He did not, however, elaborate.\n\n\u2014 Written by Sudhin Thanawala\n\nCopyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
