The cloud of awkwardness and clumsy misfortune continues to loom over Jeb Bush's head while on the campaign trail. At a rotary club rally in New Hampshire on Tuesday, Jeb was interrupted during the middle of his speech and ushered off stage.

"They're kicking me out the door," Jeb said. "They're kicking me out the door."

He then proceeded to awkwardly nod his head, walk around in a circle, and then move off stage.

Wether it be the chest bump in Iowa, giving out turtles to kids in New Hampshire, or the bizarre campaign ad of him struggling with a hoodie in Las Vegas, Jeb simply struggles with relating to the everyday American. He continues to go out of his way to act like an everyday American; and in doing so, proves that he is not.
