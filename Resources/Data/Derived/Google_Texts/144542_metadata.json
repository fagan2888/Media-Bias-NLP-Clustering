Charles Diggs\u2014was charged with taking kickbacks from members of his congressional staff whose salaries he had raised. Although Diggs was subsequently convicted on Oct. 7, 1979 on 11 counts of mail fraud and filing false payroll forms, the one-time funeral director continued to insist he\u2019d done nothing wrong \u2013 and was reelected while he awaited sentencing.\n\nDiggs was censured by the House on July 31, 1979 but held his seat until June 3, 1980, when he finally resigned in disgrace and was sentenced to three years in prison.\n\nRelated: U.S. Representative Grimm Plead Guilty to Tax Fraud\n\nDiggs\u2019 experience may inspire Rep. Michael G. Grimm (R-NY) in his apparent effort to cling to his Staten Island House seat after pleading guilty Tuesday to a tax fraud charge. Nobody has ever accused the onetime FBI special agent of lacking chutzpah.\n\nWHY THIS MATTERS\n\n\n\nRep. Michael Grimm (R-NY) isn\u2019t the first member of Congress to try to keep his seat despite a criminal conviction. Yet there\u2019s almost zero tolerance among leading lawmakers for those caught by prosecutors with their hands in the cookie jar.\n\nGrimm handily won reelection to a third term Nov. 4 after being slammed last April with a 20-count federal indictment for tax fraud in connection with a Manhattan restaurant he once owned called Healthalicious. While operating the restaurant, he was charged with underreporting gross receipts and paying some employees \u201coff the books\u201d to avoid taxes.\n\nGrimm faces sentencing next June. Federal prosecutors are seeking a penalty of at least two years in prison, The New York Times has reported. But Grimm insists what he did was no big deal \u2013 something many Americans routinely do in hiding their true tax liabilities.\n\n\u201cAs long as I am able to serve I\u2019m going to serve,\u201d Grimm told reporters outside the Brooklyn federal courthouse.\n\nRelated: Dumb and Dumber Candidates Put Daily News in an Endorsement Quandry\n\nHouse Speaker John Boehner and other GOP leaders may have a different view: Grimm may face pressure from his own colleagues and Democrats to do the right thing and step down \u2013 before somebody begins calling for his censure or expulsion.\n\nSay whatever you want about about Grimm -- he\u2019s the latest in a sizable rogue\u2019s gallery of shamelessly corrupt members of Congress going back decades. With 535 politicians serving in the House and Senate at any one time, there\u2019s always bound to be at least one bad apple.\n\nRelated: What Really Brought Down Jesse Jackson Jr.?\n\nHere are just a few other notable examples:\n\nFormer Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr. (D-IL) pleaded guilty Feb. 20, 2013, to one count of wire and mail fraud and was sentenced to two-and-a-half years in prison. Jackson used $750,000 in campaign funds to lead a lavish lifestyle.\n\nFormer Rep. Rick Renzi (R-AZ) was convicted June 12, 2013 of 17 counts of wire fraud, conspiracy, extortion, racketeering and money laundering after looting a family insurance business to help pay for his 2012 campaign.\n\nFormer Rep. William J. Jefferson (D-LA) was charged in August 2005 with accepting bribes after the FBI seized $90,000 in cash stored in baggies in his freezer. Jefferson was reelected to the House in 2006 but lost two years later. He was convicted in November 2009 and sentenced to 13 years in prison.\n\nFormer Rep. Bob Ney (R-OH) pleaded guilty in 2006 to conspiracy and making false statements after receiving luxury trips from corrupt lobbyist Jack Abramoff in return for legislative favors. Ney was sentenced to 30 months in prison. He tried to retain his seat but was forced to resign Nov. 3 of that year, four days before the general election.\n\nRelated: Why Americans Are Being Too Harsh on Congress\n\nFormer Rep. Duke Cunningham (R-CA) pleaded guilty in November 2008 to charges of conspiracy to commit bribery, mail fraud and tax evasion and was sentenced to over eight years in prison.\n\nFormer Rep. Jim Traficant (D-OH) was convicted of 10 felony counts including bribery, racketeering and tax evasion on April 15, 2002. He was expelled from Congress on July 24 and sentenced to seven years in federal prison. That didn\u2019t deter the colorful Traficant. He ran as an independent candidate for another House term while incarcerated at the federal penitentiary at Allenwood \u2013 and actually received 15 percent of the vote. He became one of only a handful of politicians in history to run for a federal office from prison.\n\nFormer House Majority Leader Tom DeLay (R-TX) was indicted in Austin in 2005 on criminal charges of conspiracy to violate election law in 2002. DeLay temporarily resigned his leadership post and later said he would not seek to return to that position. He was convicted in January 2011 and sentenced to three years in prison but was free on bail. However, the conviction was overturned by the Texas Court of Appeals on Sept. 19, 2013, on the grounds the evidence was \u201clegally insufficient.\u201d That ruling survived a challenge by the prosecutors in the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals last October.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "By pleading guilty this week to a tax fraud charge, Rep.
