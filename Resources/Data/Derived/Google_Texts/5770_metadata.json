John McCain (R-Ariz.) prepares to defend a Senate seat he has held since 1987, conservative forces are struggling to field a candidate to derail him. Stung by recent losses, the groups that typically finance upstart GOP challengers are gun-shy about bankrolling a sacrificial lamb. And McCain\u2019s reputation as a fierce and aggressive campaigner appears to be giving pause to some of his would-be foes.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThe lack of movement is a sharp contrast to the animus conservatives have directed at McCain over his long and colorful career. Conservative House members from Arizona have declined to endorse him, yet they aren\u2019t eager to run against him, either. A little-known state senator is starting to lay the groundwork for a run, but conservative outside groups worry that bankrolling her campaign could be a waste of precious resources. And McCain allies have effectively purged the state party of troublemakers, booting foes who could shift the Arizona Republican Party dramatically to the right.\n\nBut McCain is still girding for an intense fight.\n\n\u201cAbsolutely, there will be a tea party challenge,\u201d McCain said in an interview about his race.\n\n\u201cI think they have to be ready,\u201d McCain said of his potential opponents, with a smile. \u201cEverybody knows it\u2019s not beanbag.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s happening in Arizona isn\u2019t unusual: Tea party groups are having a hard time ousting GOP senators in key primaries across the country. Coming off an unsuccessful 2014 midterm season \u2014 after taking out Republican senators in 2010 and 2012 elections \u2014 the activist right has yet to field formidable candidates in any of the 22 states where Republican senators are currently running for reelection.\n\nEven in states where there\u2019s a potential threat from the right, such as Illinois, Republican senators are building up big cash reserves that will make them very tough to beat.\n\nMcCain, 78, who chairs the Senate Armed Services Committee, has amassed a war chest of $3.6 million after raising $1.6 million in the first quarter of this year, according to numbers he plans to report this week. He\u2019s feeling good about his position heading into 2016: His hawkish foreign policy profile plays to his favor, he believes, as international issues dominate the national landscape. And his reputation as a bare-knuckle campaigner has apparently made conservatives who dislike his history of deal-making think twice about mounting a challenge.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s how we fight wars, by the way: You just crush the opponent, and then you don\u2019t have to worry about as many opponents,\u201d said former Arizona Sen. Jon Kyl, referring to McCain\u2019s campaign tactics.\n\nTwo possible foes \u2014 conservative Reps. Matt Salmon and David Schweikert \u2014 said in interviews they would likely stay put in the House. \u201cI\u2019m happy where I\u2019m at,\u201d Salmon said.\n\nAdded Schweikert, \u201cMy wife has made it very clear that, at least at this moment in time, if I\u2019d like to keep her, then I can\u2019t run.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, two other House Republicans \u2014 Reps. Trent Franks and Paul Gosar \u2014 refused to endorse McCain, a sign of how touchy an issue McCain remains among many conservative politicians.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s best for me to demur on the question,\u201d Franks said, \u201cbecause I certainly have no intention of running myself, and I don\u2019t know of anybody in the delegation that\u2019s running.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not supporting anybody,\u201d Gosar said.\n\nFew relish a fight as much as McCain does. In the interview, he assessed his own vulnerabilities \u2014 unprompted, as if to take on his critics.\n\nThe \u201cmain source of dissatisfaction\u201d among conservatives, McCain said, continues to be his role in co-authoring a comprehensive immigration reform bill that would have provided a pathway to citizenship for the nation\u2019s 11 million illegal immigrants. The issue is particularly salient in Arizona because of its border-state status. Some conservative skeptics, he adds, say he should have joined Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) in pushing to defund Obamacare in 2013, a fight that led to the government shutdown.\n\n\u201cThe reason why I\u2019m still here is because I take every challenge with the utmost seriousness,\u201d McCain said. \u201cIf you don\u2019t, then you\u2019re both foolish and vulnerable.\u201d\n\nOne person who knows that as well as anyone is J.D. Hayworth, who took a drubbing in a 2010 primary against McCain, after the senator \u2014 fresh off his 2008 presidential defeat \u2014 poured $20 million into a scorched-earth campaign against him. McCain ran ads calling Hayworth, a former congressman, a \u201chuckster\u201d for appearing in TV commercials promising viewers government funds that didn\u2019t have to be repaid, and he ripped Hayworth\u2019s fiscal discipline and role as a lobbyist. McCain ended up winning the primary by 24 points.\n\nSo far, the only candidate who appears to be laying the groundwork for a 2016 run is state Sen. Kelli Ward. But she\u2019s struggling to consolidate support among people on the right. Some of her actions in office, such as holding a field hearing on whether chemicals sprayed from airplanes are part of a government plot \u2014 known as the chemtrail theory \u2014 have prompted conservative groups to keep their distance.\n\n\u201cMcCain\u2019s going to call her \u2018Chemtrail Kelli,\u2019 or something like that. I worry about that,\u201d said Adam Brandon, CEO of FreedomWorks, a conservative group active in primaries.\n\nTwo other outside groups that have done battle with McCain in the past \u2014 the Senate Conservatives Fund and Club for Growth \u2014 were mum on whether they\u2019d be open to Ward\u2019s candidacy. And House conservatives who won\u2019t back McCain seem unwilling to stump on her behalf.\n\n\u201cShe wanted to get my endorsement, but like I said, I don\u2019t play in primaries from that standpoint,\u201d said Gosar, whose district encompasses Lake Havasu City, where Ward has lived since 1999.\n\nIn an interview, Ward rejected the chemtrails criticism, contending the issue merely came up at a larger hearing about air, soil and water quality in her district. She said several constituents asked her to convene the hearing with state environmental officials and then asked about chemtrails.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe in the chemtrail theory,\u201d she added.\n\nWard said she\u2019ll decide whether to run in the next two months; under Arizona\u2019s \u201cresign-to-run\u201d law, she would have to forfeit her state Senate seat. But she said she\u2019s received ample encouragement to present a \u201cpositive and principled conservative\u201d alternative to McCain. Ward says she\u2019s also prepared for the senator\u2019s tough campaign tactics, though she acknowledged \u201cthat\u2019s always in the back of your mind.\n\n\u201cI want to prove to myself, first, that I can actually raise my own money, not having to depend on outside sources,\u201d she said in a phone interview. Ward added that if she\u2019s successful, groups like Club for Growth and Senate Conservatives Fund might give her another look. She\u2019s already making several hours of fundraising calls per day, she said.\n\nWard has had only cursory introductions with conservative groups so far \u2014 far from the intensive back-and-forth that would likely precede formal endorsements.\n\nAsked for comment on Ward\u2019s likely candidacy, a Senate Conservatives Fund spokeswoman pointed to a letter from the group\u2019s leader, Ken Cuccinelli, who called on supporters to help identify a credible opponent. Brandon, the Freedomworks CEO, said there\u2019s still plenty of time to find a candidate.\n\n\u201cFor a race like this, I see no problem in waiting until the fall for a challenger,\u201d he said, adding that he\u2019s still holding out hope Salmon will change his mind and run.\n\n\u201cIf it\u2019s September and October, then I\u2019m going to start saying it\u2019s getting to be too late,\u201d he said.\n\nSean Noble, a Republican consultant with longtime ties to Arizona politics, said if McCain were vulnerable, Schweikert and Salmon \u201cwould be in the race.\u201d\n\nMcCain advisers believe that there will always be roughly 30 percent of the GOP primary electorate that\u2019s unhappy with the senior Arizona senator. The key is to prevent that 30 percent from growing and assuming influential positions in the state party.\n\nTo that end, McCain allies have worked aggressively behind the scenes to install local GOP allies of the senator to key committee posts and oust right-wing Republicans. They successfully ejected Timothy Schwartz, who co-authored a McCain censure resolution last year, as well as other GOP agitators.\n\nMcCain said he was not directly involved in the push, but he\u2019s been pleased by the outcome.\n\n\u201cThere were some people who were very unhappy with me over there \u2014 but they are a minority,\u201d McCain said.\n\nRepublican Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake said of the censure resolutions, \u201cit doesn\u2019t help anybody.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s always an element that will voice displeasure,\u201d Flake said, \u201cbut in the end, Sen. McCain wins and wins big.\u201d\n\nJake Sherman contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "The senator\u2019s hardball tactics seem to spook would-be challengers.", "title": "Is the tea party afraid of John McCain?", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/04/is-the-tea-party-afraid-of-john-mccain-116977.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2015/04/14/lede_150414_john_mccain_gty_1160.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Congress,Tea Party,Senate,Senate Elections 2016,Arizona,John McCain", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "The senator\u2019s hardball tactics seem to spook would-be challengers.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "And McCain allies have effectively purged the state party of troublemakers, booting foes who could shift the Arizona Republican Party dramatically to the right.\n\u201cAbsolutely, there will be a tea party challenge,\u201d McCain said in an interview about his race.\nSo far, the only candidate who appears to be laying the groundwork for a 2016 run is state Sen.
