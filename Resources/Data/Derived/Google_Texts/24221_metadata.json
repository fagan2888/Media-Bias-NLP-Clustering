We didn\u2019t pay our kids for good grades, but I can\u2019t really think of a strong argument not to pay them for success in school.\n\nYou could say you shouldn\u2019t pay them because it\u2019s something they\u2019re expected to do anyway, and that\u2019s somewhat valid. But you could also make the same point where chores around the house are concerned, too.\n\nWe paid our kids to do some chores, but really the point is not about the economic value. It\u2019s the fact that you want your kids to associate work with money. I still meet people my age and older who haven\u2019t made that connection. Work creates money, and that\u2019s an important thing to teach your kids. Once they\u2019ve created some money by working, then you want to use those moments to teach them to save, spend and give wisely.\n\nYou can do this around the subject of grades if you want. There\u2019s probably a valid case to be made that getting an \u201cA\u201d takes a lot more work than getting a \u201cC.\u201d You\u2019re certainly not obligated to pay them for work or grades, but if you don\u2019t do some of this \u2014 and teach them the proper ways to handle the money they earn \u2014 you\u2019ll miss out on a lot a fantastic teachable moments.\n\nMy husband and I are on Baby Step 2 of your plan. We\u2019ve got our starter emergency fund of $1,000 in the bank, and we\u2019re busy paying off credit cards and unpaid taxes from previous years. He thinks it\u2019s OK to take trips and save up for other fun things while we\u2019re doing this, but I disagree. I want to cut out all extra spending and pay off our debt as fast as possible. What\u2019s your opinion?\n\nIt\u2019s OK to do those things in the general philosophy of life. Unfortunately, that\u2019s not what I teach when it comes to getting out of debt and gaining control of your finances. The reason people are successful following my plan is because I teach common sense combined with an unbridled, scorched-earth kind of intensity.\n\nLet\u2019s take a closer look at this. You have unpaid taxes, not to mention credit card debt hanging over your heads, and he\u2019s talking about going on a trip and saving up for toys? I\u2019m sorry, but that\u2019s completely irresponsible. Remember when we were kids, and Mommy and Daddy wouldn\u2019t let us go outside and play until we had cleaned up our mess? That\u2019s the kind of thing I teach.\n\nThere\u2019s a process here. There\u2019s an idea and a concept behind what I teach, and when you plug into it, you\u2019re going to start moving in a positive direction. In short, behaviors have to change. The more dramatically they change, the better results you get and the faster you fix things. But if you don\u2019t plug into it \u2014 if he doesn\u2019t plug into it \u2014 you guys are going to keep getting the same results you\u2019ve been getting, which basically stink.\n\nDave Ramsey is a personal money management expert, author and national radio personality.
