It\u2019s an interesting question. Obviously the fact that she became the target of Donald Trump\u2019s ire is going to help her with everyone who isn\u2019t in the Trump camp. (The enemy of my enemy is my friend.) But can she translate this moment into a real move into the top tier? Politico looks at the question.\n\nCarly Fiorina\u2019s victory at Thursday\u2019s so-called junior varsity presidential debate quickly gave way to her next \u2014 and most daunting \u2014 challenge: transforming soundbites into campaign-trail traction. Fiorina, who spent her day on a media blitz and in private meetings with potential supporters, offered a sober assessment of her task when asked by a POLITICO reporter about her strategy to capitalize on post-debate momentum. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve been doing is building up momentum with donors, with supporters, with money. We\u2019re going to keep doing that. It\u2019s just that it gets a little easier when more people know who you are,\u201d she said at RedState, a conservative gathering in Georgia.\n\nI think sometimes we tend to forget that even though there wasn\u2019t any money gushing her way and the field was crowded like a rugby scrum, Fiorina was the one who was showing up outside of Hillary Clinton events and sticking it to her. She immediately struck me as someone who was a bit more \u201cfireproof\u201d in terms of media bias when it came to being able to hit Hillary where she lives. And she\u2019s done an admirable job of it from day one. Could she carry the banner for the GOP in the general election if this transformative moment moves her into the top tier?\n\nFrankly, I\u2019ve thought so since the first time I interviewed her at CPAC. She\u2019s very impressive and her performance in the first debate underscored that. She\u2019s nearly impossible to shake up under questioning and can keep a laser focus on the topic at hand. But her fundraising and poll numbers have still lagged\u2026 and that\u2019s a problem. There have been any number of good candidates from both parties who have been left in the dust for just that reason and we can\u2019t deny the realities of modern politics.\n\nIf Carly Fiorina wants to be the next president, she\u2019s got to break out of the JV ranks. This week has presented her with an opportunity. But the sad fact of the matter is that you can\u2019t be a great president without being a great politician first. She\u2019s going to have to find a way to build on this moment and put herself on the big stage. How Trump plays into that is yet to be seen, but Carly needs to make a big move now or the moment may pass her by.\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "Rising", "title": "Carly \u201cthe real deal\u201d Fiorina on the rise?", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2015/08/08/carly-the-real-deal-fiorina-on-the-rise/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary", "creator": "@JazzShaw"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "article": {"published_time": "2015-08-08T22:01:51+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-08-08T20:49:26+00:00"}, "keywords": "2016 election, Carly Fiorina, GOP primary,", "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdfe54\"", "article_summary": "If Carly Fiorina wants to be the next president, she\u2019s got to break out of the JV ranks.\nCarly \u201cthe real deal\u201d Fiorina on the rise?\nShe\u2019s going to have to find a way to build on this moment and put herself on the big stage.\nCarly Fiorina\u2019s victory at Thursday\u2019s so-called junior varsity presidential debate quickly gave way to her next \u2014 and most daunting \u2014 challenge: transforming soundbites into campaign-trail traction.\nBut can she translate this moment into a real move into the top tier?"}
