MADRID (AP) â€” Spanish police say they have busted two international drug-smuggling rings, arrested 20 people on suspicion of trafficking in narcotics and seized large quantities of heroin and hashish.

Police said they found 56 kilograms (123 pounds) of heroin inside hidden compartments within a Porsche Cayenne that was stopped in the northwestern town of Tui. Police arrested 12 people with Albanian and Spanish nationalities on suspicion of drug smuggling with the intention of distributing them in Spain and Portugal.

Eight other suspects were arrested in connection with 1.8 metric tons (2 short tons) of hashish seized on the French border and another load of 1.9 tons of the same substance found concealed within air conditioning and electricity generating units in the southern port city of Malaga, police said in a statement Sunday.
