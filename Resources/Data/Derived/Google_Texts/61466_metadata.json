The Integrity Project, an environmental organization based in Washington, D.C., said it used the industry-backed database, FracFocus, to identify violations and to determine the records had been retroactively amended by the companies to erase the evidence.\n\nThe Safe Drinking Water Act requires drilling companies to obtain permits when they intend to use diesel fuel in their fracking operations. As well, the companies are obligated to notify nearby landowners of their activity, report the chemical and physical characteristics of the fluids used, conduct water quality tests before and after drilling, and test the integrity of well structures to ensure they can withstand high injection pressures. Diesel fuel contains a high concentration of carcinogenic chemicals including benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylene, and they disperse easily in groundwater.\n\nFracFocus is an online registry that allows companies to list the chemicals they use during fracking. At least 10 states, including Texas, Colorado and Pennsylvania, mandate the use of the website for such disclosures.\n\nThe report asserts that the industry data shows that the companies admitted using diesel without the proper permits. The Integrity Project\u2019s analysis, the report said, then showed that in some 30 percent of those cases, the companies later removed the information about their diesel use from the database.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s problematic is that this is an industry that is self-reporting and self-policing,\u201d said Mary Greene, senior managing attorney for the environmental organization. \u201cThere\u2019s no federal or state oversight of [filings with FracFocus].\u201d\n\nThe FracFocus website currently has no way to track changes to disclosures. The Integrity Project noticed the changes when it compared newer disclosures to those in older FracFocus data purchased from PIVOT Upstream Group, a consulting firm in Houston.\n\nEnergy In Depth, the communications and research arm of the Independent Petroleum Association of America, published a lengthy response to the Integrity Project\u2019s report and criticized it for including diesel use that occurred prior to a 2014 Environmental Protection Agency rule clarifying the types of chemicals considered \u201cdiesel fuels.\u201d\n\nEnergy In Depth said the Integrity Project was \u201cretroactively changing the definition of diesel fuel in order to malign more operations for engaging in an activity (a \u201cdiesel frack\u201d) that did not occur.\u201d\n\nThe EPA first listed kerosene as a type of diesel fuel in May 2012 when it released a draft version of the rule finalized this year. Kerosene is also listed as a type of diesel fuel in the definition of the Toxic Substance Control Act, which controls the production, use and disposal of chemicals.\n\nIn its response, Energy In Depth also pointed out that in some cases companies may have provided incorrect data to the FracFocus website and were seeking to correct it, not skirt the law.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Between 2010 and July 2014 at least 351 wells were fracked using diesel fuels without a permit, a new report found", "author": "Naveena Sadasivam", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Between 2010 and July 2014 at least 351 wells were fracked using diesel fuels without a permit, a new report found", "title": "Big oil has been illegally using diesel fuel and lying about it", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/08/16/big_oil_has_been_illegally_using_diesel_fuel_and_lying_about_it/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/04/shutterstock_159492812-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Between 2010 and July 2014 at least 351 wells were fracked using diesel fuels without a permit, a new report found", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/04/shutterstock_159492812-1280x960.jpg", "title": "Big oil has been illegally using diesel fuel and lying about it", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Big oil has been illegally using diesel fuel and lying about it", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Big Oil, Diesel, Environment, fracking, hydraulic fracturing, Oil, ProPublica, Safe Drinking and Water Act", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce659\"", "article_summary": "Diesel fuel contains a high concentration of carcinogenic chemicals including benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylene, and they disperse easily in groundwater.\nKerosene is also listed as a type of diesel fuel in the definition of the Toxic Substance Control Act, which controls the production, use and disposal of chemicals.\nThe Safe Drinking Water Act requires drilling companies to obtain permits when they intend to use diesel fuel in their fracking operations.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no federal or state oversight of [filings with FracFocus].\u201dThe FracFocus website currently has no way to track changes to disclosures.\nThe report, published this week by the Environmental Integrity Project, found that between 2010 and July 2014 at least 351 wells were fracked by 33 different companies using diesel fuels without a permit."}
