The Arapahoe County Sheriff’s Office is asking the community to help find a family dog taken during a burglary in Aurora Friday afternoon.

Around 1:20 p.m., a suspect was caught on camera robbing a home in the 5000 block of South Himalaya Court. He can be seen spraying the homeowners’ three dogs with some sort of chemical, possibly pepper spray.

Roughly two hours later, he returned and took one of the dogs, Roo, with him.

Anyone with information is asked to call Crime Stoppers at 720-913-STOP (7867).
