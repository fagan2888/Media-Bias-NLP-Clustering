More specifically, the thinking at the time went, it was Chief Justice John Roberts who, in a herculean act of statesmanship, cast the deciding vote to \u201cuphold\u201d Obamacare. Celebrations ensued among supporters of the law; President Obama himself delivered remarks saying, \u201cthe Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act.\u201d\n\nJohn Roberts certainly could have done much more damage to the law, had he chosen to. He could have joined the four other conservatives on the bench who were prepared to take down not just the individual mandate, but the entire law itself. What a peach.\n\nStill, as early estimates of the newly ensured under Obamacare\u2019s implementation are rolling in, it\u2019s time to write a second draft of history \u2014 one that doesn\u2019t include anything about John Roberts \u201cupholding\u201d or \u201csaving\u201d Obamacare. Because that\u2019s an odd way to describe a decision that gutted the most effective part of the law.\n\nWhile the White House was popping champagne over the survival of the law\u2019s requirement for individuals to obtain health coverage or suffer a tax penalty, Republican-held state governments were more focused on that \u201cother\u201d part of the majority decision: the one that allowed states to opt out of the law\u2019s Medicaid expansion and suffer no consequences to its pre-expansion Medicaid funding. The White House, at least publicly, blew this off. \u201cSenior Obama administration officials downplayed the impact of the Medicaid portion of the court ruling, saying as a practical matter it is not particularly significant,\u201d the Wall Street Journal reported at the time. After all, the thinking went, what state would be crazy enough to turn down all this money \u2014 an expansion that the federal government would fund 100 percent of in the beginning, and 90 percent of permanently?\n\nTwo years later, we have the answer: Many, many states would be precisely that crazy! Let\u2019s call it two dozen. The Kaiser Family Foundation breaks it down as 19 states \u201cnot moving forward at this time,\u201d while the issue is under \u201copen debate\u201d in five states. And it is definitely not certain that those \u201copen debates\u201d will produce Medicaid expansions.\n\nWhen the law was crafted, it was estimated that the Medicaid expansion \u2014 covering all those up to 133 percent of the federal poverty level \u2014 would add 17 million to the rolls of the insured, comprising approximately half of the total. This was the law\u2019s broadest, bluntest instrument for reducing the uninsured, targeting those who needed relief the most: the poor.\n\nAnd a number of estimates are coming in now confirming that Medicaid, not the individual exchanges, has been the more successful tool for bringing down the country\u2019s percentage of uninsured.\n\nThe Rand Corp.\u2019s latest survey finds that the nation\u2019s uninsured rate dropped from 20.5 to 15.8 percent from September 2013 to mid-March 2014. And of those who were previously uninsured but are now insured, 3.6 million can be accredited to Medicaid, while 1.4 million found insurance through the exchanges.\n\nThe Urban Institute\u2019s survey \u2014 which, like the Rand Corp.\u2019s, does not cover the late-March surge in enrollment \u2014 found that \u201c5.4 million U.S. adults gained health insurance since September 2013,\u201d and had this to offer about Medicaid:", "article_metadata": {"description": "Time to stop saying he \"upheld\" healthcare reform.
