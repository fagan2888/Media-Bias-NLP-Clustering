Unless Americans re-examine some assumptions they\u2019ve made about themselves, they argue, Ferguson could be the future.\n\nAssumption No. 1: Tiger Woods is going to save us\n\nIt\u2019s called the \u201cbrowning of America.\u201d Google the phrase and you\u2019ll get 18 million hits. By 2050, most of the nation\u2019s citizens are expected to be people of color, according to the Pew Research Center.\n\nDig beneath the Google links and one can detect an emerging assumption: Racial flashpoints like Ferguson will fade in the future because no single race will be dominant. You could call it the Tiger Woods effect. The New American will claim multiple racial origins like Woods, the pro golfer. Demographic change will accomplish what a thousand national conversations on race could never do: lesson the sting of racial conflict.\n\nA dramatic increase in interracial marriages will change the racial landscape as more people cross racial and ethnic lines to marry. But that change won\u2019t be a cure-all, says Rory Kramer, a sociology and criminology professor at Villanova University in Pennsylvania.\n\nHe says racial progress is not inevitable with the browning of America.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to deny the optimism,\u201d Kramer says. \u201cI deny the assumption that it will happen without effort.\u201d\n\nSo does research from a prominent American sociologist. Robert Putnam, author of \u201cBowling Alone,\u201d says his studies of multiracial neighborhoods in America show that more diversity initially erodes community.\n\nIn his 2007 paper, \u201cE Pluribus Unum: Diversity and Community in the Twenty-first Century,\u201d Putnam says members of multiracial communities initially tend to expect the worst, distrust neighbors and withdraw.\n\n\u201cResidents of all races tend to \u2018hunker down,\u2019 \u201d Putnam writes. \u201cTrust (even of one\u2019s own race) is lower, altruism and community cooperation rarer, friends fewer.\u201d\n\nIf Americans want to live in a tranquil country that\u2019s free of racial conflict they would have to change their character and history, another scholar says.\n\nThey would have to become like Iceland.\n\nThere are no Fergusons there. The United Nations commissioned a report last year that concluded its citizens are among the most contented in the world.\n\nIceland is so free of conflict that the nation was shocked last year when a police officer shot a man to death. It was the first time police had killed anyone in Iceland in 70 years. Most police in Iceland don\u2019t carry guns.\n\nBut that happiness comes at a price, says Lisa Corrigan, director of the Gender Studies Program at the University of Arkansas, who cites the Iceland comparison. Iceland has one of the most homogeneous populations in the world \u2014 everyone looks the same. And they deliberately keep it that way.\n\n\u201cIceland is one of the happiest places in the world,\u201d Corrigan says.\n\nCorrigan doesn\u2019t accept the notion that most white people will welcome the browning of a country that she says was built on white male supremacy.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to get worse before it gets better,\u201d she says, \u201cbecause power is shifting and white people think that their whiteness is property to be defended.\u201d\n\nAssumption No. 2: We\u2019ll always have democracy\n\nSome observers have reduced the events in Ferguson to race and class divisions, but there are others who say the protests are ultimately a question about whether democracy can work.\n\nThe political makeup of Ferguson has been well-documented. Two-thirds of the city\u2019s population is black. The mayor and police chief are white; as are five of the six city council members. There are three blacks out of 53 people in its police department.\n\nMany Americans love the concept of the melting pot, the notion that every ethnic group eventually becomes a part of the country\u2019s mainstream. Yet some scholars say you can\u2019t have harmony in a multiracial community until hard choices are made about power: what group gets what and how.\n\nKramer, the Villanova professor, quotes the 19th century abolitionist Frederick Douglass to make his point.\n\n\u201cPower concedes nothing without demand. It never has and it never will.\u201d\n\nBecause people tend not to share power, there will be more Fergusons in America\u2019s future: isolated communities ignored by leaders and harassed by heavily armed police forces, says Charles Gallagher, a sociology professor at LaSalle University in Pennsylvania.\n\nThe nation won\u2019t have a vibrant middle class because of persistent income inequality; it will primarily be the rich and poor, he says. The poor won\u2019t vote because they\u2019re too disenchanted, and politicians will ignore the concerns of most Americans because wealthy people control politics, Gallagher says.\n\n\u201cI see us looking more and more like Latin America,\u201d he says.\n\nThe courts could intervene on behalf of racial minorities and the poor. The citizens of Ferguson could, for example pressure their city leaders to place more blacks in their police force.\n\nYet the conservative majority on the U.S. Supreme Court has changed the legal landscape to make such efforts more difficult, Gallagher says. The court has consistently ruled against any diversity efforts hinting at racial preferences.\n\n\u201cThis particular court is hostile to the idea of using race in any situation to honestly address ongoing inequalities,\u201d Gallagher says.\n\nRacial minorities who feel like they\u2019re excluded won\u2019t find much empathy from ordinary white Americans either, says Kramer, the Villanova professor. He says many whites operate under this assumption: If they gain, I lose.\n\nThat assumption, he says, is played out in Southern states that refuse to accept Obamacare, in the rise of voter ID laws and in the political version of white flight \u2014 where predominantly white communities break away from their counties to incorporate their own cities when too many minorities move into nearby neighborhoods.\n\nHe says American democracy was called a \u201cnoble experiment\u201d for a reason: People didn\u2019t know if democracy, let alone a multiethnic democracy, would work.\n\nDemocracy in America could look more like how protesters describe Ferguson: a place where government maintains the fa\u00e7ade of a democracy, but doesn\u2019t function like one.\n\n\u201cPeople don\u2019t realize that we\u2019re still in the experimental stage,\u201d Kramer says. \u201cMy fear is that we\u2019re not going to actually gain true democracy.\u201d\n\nAssumption No. 3: It\u2019s always about race\n\nSome see another type of frightening scenario for America based on Ferguson. To them, it\u2019s premature to say that Darren Wilson, the Ferguson officer who shot Michael Brown to death, was motivated by racism.\n\nThey see Ferguson as a stage for the rise of \u201cracial grifters.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s the term John Nolte, a columnist for Breitbart.com, uses to describe leaders who rallied to the side of black protesters in Ferguson.\n\n\u201cThey go into these areas and scream racism before the facts are out and all of a sudden, there\u2019s a racial issue,\u201d he says. \u201cThey grift on race to profit from it, like Al Sharpton.\u201d\n\nNolte rejects the notion that some white Americans fear the nation becoming a majority brown country. He says he was one of a handful of whites who lived in a Latino community in Los Angeles for years, and he never had a problem. His wife is Latina, and his extended family has people of all races.\n\nHe says he\u2019s \u201cpro-miscegenation,\u201d a term he borrows from his late friend, Andrew Breitbart, because ultimately \u201cpeople are people.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe American people get along very well,\u201d Nolte says. \u201cIt\u2019s only when you have situations like you have in Ferguson \u2014 and the racial grifters move in and the media moves to back them up \u2014 that things turn into what they do.\u201d\n\nNolte says there\u2019s a hidden motive behind the furor in racial flashpoints like Ferguson, and that media organizations like CNN are complicit.\n\nHe says the furor over the black teenager Trayvon Martin\u2019s death in Florida took place just before the last presidential election. The uproar over Ferguson is taking place just before this year\u2019s midterm elections.\n\n\u201cIf these things aren\u2019t happening every few months, if we start to heal and look past racial divisions, the Democrats lose 25% of the black or Hispanic vote and they\u2019re done as a national party.\u201d\n\nThe country won\u2019t get past its racial divisions anytime soon because it\u2019s the only way Democrats can win, he says.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s too much profit in it for the racial grifters and the media for anyone to try to heal us,\u201d he says. \u201cWe never talk about how far we\u2019ve come.\u201d\n\nRacial divisions will remain a permanent part of America\u2019s future as long as the media tells black people that the criminal justice system is stacked against them, says Ben Shapiro, author of \u201cBullies: How the Left\u2019s Culture of Fear and Intimidation Silences America.\u201d\n\nAccording to a 2013 report released by the Missouri attorney general, African-Americans are highly over-represented in crime statistics. They accounted for 93% of arrests after traffic stops, 92% of searches and 86% of traffic stops in Ferguson.\n\n\u201cThe cure is not to tell people that the criminal justice system is stacked against them; the cure is to minimize criminal activity and identify lawbreaking officers and prosecute them,\u201d says Shaprio, who is also editor-in-chief at the online magazine TruthRevolt.\n\nShapiro says he is more concerned about another way America may decline in the future: the erosion of values like hard work, marriage and education.\n\n\u201cThe reality is that if you want to escape poverty, you only have to make a couple of decisions: Finish school, don\u2019t have a baby out of wedlock and get a job \u2014 that\u2019s it,\u201d he says.\n\nAssumption No. 4: We need to get past our racial differences\n\nWhenever a racial flashpoint erupts in America, weary people on both sides of the issue tend to ask the same questions:\n\nWhen are we going to get past race? Why can\u2019t we all just be Americans? Can\u2019t we all just get along?\n\nBut what if we shouldn\u2019t just get along? What if the constant conflict among different races and points of view is, in some ways, good for America?\n\nThat\u2019s the perspective of Anthony P. Carnevale, director of the Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce. Carnevale is an authority on affirmative action in higher education and an economist.\n\nHe says society can\u2019t have diversity without disruption and that scholars know from research that \u201cfrom that tension comes great creativity.\u201d\n\nThe trick is to harness that tension for good, Carnevale says.\n\n\u201cIf you have only white men sitting in a room making decisions, you get low-quality decisions and very little change,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you include a woman and a minority in that room, the whole process changes. You get more quality and innovation.\u201d\n\nHe says America is a successful country partly because its citizens never stop arguing. Those clashes force people to think, abandon what no longer works and innovate.\n\n\u201cQuiet, peaceful communities rarely invent things,\u201d Carnevale says. \u201cThe Romans failed because they kept marrying each other and they all looked the same. Their habits became set. There was no challenge to the elites.\u201d\n\nProtests like those in Ferguson will continue because many whites still believe that \u201cwhat happens to somebody is about them, and is not about the circumstances in which they live.\u201d\n\nYet eventually there will be a \u201cthird wave\u201d of racial minorities, Carnevale says. And those people will bring a different sensibility to the way we regard race and class.\n\n\u201cThere are two ways to change a democracy,\u201d he says. One is to change its leaders and the other is to change its people.\n\n\u201cAnd the people are changing.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "(CNN) -- The protests in Ferguson, Missouri, have been described as a mirror into contemporary America, but they are also something else: A crystal ball.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=", "og": {"site_name": "Q13 FOX News", "description": "(CNN) \u2014 The protests in Ferguson, Missouri, have been described as a mirror into contemporary America, but they are also something else: A crystal ball.
