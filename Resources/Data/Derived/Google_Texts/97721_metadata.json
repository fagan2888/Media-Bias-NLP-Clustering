On Saturday, she watched as he was lowered into the ground with yellow flowers decorating his cadet blue casket at Live Oak Memorial Gardens cemetery in Charleston.\n\nJudy Scott mumbled prayers to herself, at times looking in the direction of the skies, while shaking her head in disbelief. She closed her eyes when she was handed the flag and clutched it tight as the crowd watched.\n\nIt was exactly a week ago, on April 4, when Walter Scott was shot and killed while running from Michael Slager, a white North Charleston police officer who pulled over Scott for a broken brake light. Slager has since been fired from his job and charged with murder.\n\nBut before Judy Scott, along with the rest of her family and friends, said goodbye to the father of four, they celebrated his life at a \u201cHomegoing Service\u201d at W.O.R.D. Ministries Christian Center, inside the same walls he frequented to sing, praise and pray.\n\nScott lay in a closed casket for most of the ceremony at the Summerville church. A blue and white flower arrangement in the shape of a star to his right had a ribbon that read \u201cbeloved son.\u201d\n\nThose who attended the service, which lasted nearly two and a half hours, showed and voiced frustration and sorrow over Scott\u2019s killing. Pastor George Hamilton fueled the crowd\u2019s anger when he dubbed Slager\u2019s actions \u201covert racism.\u201d\n\n\u201cWalter\u2019s death was motivated by racial prejudice,\u201d Hamilton said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to hate somebody to shoot them in the back.\u201d\n\nBut family members who addressed those who attended the service said they hoped Scott\u2019s death would trigger changes in police practices nationwide.\n\n\u201cI know that my family was chosen to be a catalyst of change,\u201d said Keya Grant, Scott\u2019s cousin. \u201cHis memory and his life will not be in vain.\u201d\n\nBoth of Scott\u2019s brothers, Rodney and Anthony, thanked those who took the time to come to the service. Scott\u2019s daughter, Samantha, also read a poem for her father.\n\n\u201cI cry every time I think about you,\u201d she read. \u201cEvery breath I take, I\u2019ll remember that you gave it to me.\u201d\n\nA picture slideshow brought tears and sighs of distress to many. But it was the sight of Scott in his casket that made many break down once it was opened, and everyone was allowed to walk to say goodbye one last time.\n\nTensions had been high for most of the morning, even before the service started. Dozens of family members and friends arrived early to ensure seating inside of the church. But as the crowd grew, its members became anxious and started to push each other, hoping to make it inside as rain clouds loomed.\n\nMany were left standing outside of the service, and some were forced to leave when heavy rain poured. But among those who made it inside were U.S. Reps. Mark Sanford and Jim Clyburn. U.S. Sen. Tim Scott and state Sen. Marlon Kimpson were also present, in addition to state Reps. Seth Whipper and Mary Tinkler; Gov. Nikki Haley\u2019s chief of staff, James Burns; and Director of Public Safety Leroy Smith.\n\nThe crowd was cut nearly in half when the service continued about 20 minutes away at the cemetery. Daniel Garner, 47, was among those who made it to the burial, after hopping on a train from Philadelphia to see Scott, his fellow seaman in the Coast Guard, for the last time.\n\n\u201cWe called him \u2018The Renaissance Man\u2019 because he always took care of himself so well,\u201d Garner said of Scott. \u201cHe was nothing but a family man. I never met a more honest man.\u201d\n\nAfter the funeral, the rain began to fall.\n\nShortly before 5 p.m., dozens gathered near the grassy lot on Rivers Avenue where Scott was killed.\n\nThe makeshift memorial at the lot had grown since the news of Scott\u2019s death spread around the world. Bouquets of flowers, American flags, candles, stuffed animals and handwritten cards to Scott\u2019s family adorned the lot\u2019s chain-link fence. Charles Dash, a former Marine, took pictures of the site on his cellphone. He had traveled all the way from the Bronx on Thursday to attend Scott\u2019s funeral.\n\n\u201cI was compelled to be here,\u201d he said. \u201cThis man here, he helped South Carolina more than anything anybody can do from a black point of view. \u201d\n\nHere, pastors and religious leaders from local churches organized a march down Remount Road. As thunder cracked, about 50 people walked in silence through the rain.\n\nCarol Washington had come from the funeral, too. She went to the same high school as Scott, St. Andrew\u2019s Parish High, but graduated four years behind him.\n\n\u201cWhere is the heart?\u201d she asked. \u201cThere is only one judge and that\u2019s God. We try to let justice prevail, but it doesn\u2019t always work.\u201d\n\nThe procession ended about a mile away, at Aldersgate United Methodist Church, with a prayer service led by 17 local pastors and Bishop L. Jonathan Holston, the Episcopal leader of the South Carolina United Methodist church. The rain stopped; the sky cleared. On the front lawn of the church, beneath two sprawling magnolia trees, the crowd prayed and sang hymns to beat of a West African djembe drum.\n\nErnestine Brunet, who just turned 82, left her family\u2019s birthday party early to be in attendance; they hadn\u2019t even had a chance to cut the pound cake yet. She gripped her cane in her right hand and held on to her sister\u2019s arm as she marched to the church. She said she managed to walk one long city block before she had to hitch a ride with a pastor.\n\nThe Rev. William Wrighten, of Washington United Methodist Church in North Charleston, was among the pastors who helped organize Saturday\u2019s service. Come Sunday morning, he\u2019ll give his own congregation a sermon \u2014 a message, he said, of love, hope and reconciliation.\n\n\u201cSometimes in life it takes a tragedy to bring a blessing. Sometimes it takes rain followed by sunshine,\u201d Wrighten said. \u201cSo although we lost a member of our community in a tragic way, it has brought the community together and hopefully, there will be systematic changes.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Walter Scott funeral: Family hopes 50-year-old's death will be 'a catalyst of change', FP LatestNews, \r\nFP LatestNewsMetro, \r\nWalter Scott, \r\nWalter Scott Key Stories, \r\nWalter Scott Key Stories, michael slager,North Charleston,police-involved shooting,Walter Scott", "og": {"site_name": "Post and Courier", "description": "Anticipation built in Judy Scott's face as an American flag that had been draped over her son's casket all morning was folded in front of her.", "title": "Walter Scott funeral: Family hopes 50-year-old's death will be 'a catalyst of change'", "url": "http://www.postandcourier.com20150411/150419832/walter-scott-funeral-family-hopes-50-year-olds-death-will-be-a-catalyst-of-change", "image": {"url": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20150411/PC16/150419832/AR/0/AR-150419832.jpg", "identifier": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20150411/PC16/150419832/AR/0/AR-150419832.jpg"}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Anticipation built in Judy Scott's face as an American flag that had been draped over her son's casket all morning was folded in front of her.", "title": "Walter Scott funeral: Family hopes 50-year-old's death will be 'a catalyst of change'", "app": {"country": "US", "name": {"ipad": "Post and Courier", "iphone": "Post and Courier", "googleplay": "Post and Courier"}, "id": {"ipad": 603721271, "iphone": 603721271, "googleplay": "com.Synapse.PandC"}}, "site": "@postandcourier", "image": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20150411/PC16/150419832/AR/0/AR-150419832.jpg?201504112202", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msvalidate.01": "05BAEC9D8820FA9F10D57DB6EB3C6192", "metered": "yes", "p": {"domain_verify": "c6511264bdb6fa45c6bb985fb86d3ab2"}, "fb": {"app_id": 146078808769941}, "tout": {"article": {"id": 150419832}}, "google-site-verification": "rAW9DX7yfiFF82k05QGF6LbZBkxcKxMTzAwNv0OCKAM", "keywords": "Walter Scott funeral: Family hopes 50-year-old's death will be 'a catalyst of change' , FP LatestNews, \r\nFP LatestNewsMetro, \r\nWalter Scott, \r\nWalter Scott Key Stories, \r\nWalter Scott Key Stories, michael slager,North Charleston,police-involved shooting,Walter Scott", "article": {"published_time": "2015-04-11T10:33:20Z", "modified_time": "2015-04-11T22:02:00Z", "author": "Christina Elmore\r\nCynthia Roldan\r\nDeanna Pan"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "description": "Anticipation built in Judy Scott's face as an American flag that had been draped over her son's casket all morning was folded in front of her."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdfd39\"", "article_summary": "Judy Scott lays a flower on the casket of her son Walter Scott along with her husband Walter Scott Sr., (right) during the burial at the Live Oak Memorial Gardens cemetery Saturday in Charleston.\nHer second son, Walter Scott, was killed by a North Charleston police officer two months after his 50th birthday.\nRead more: For complete coverage of the Walter Scott shooting, go to postandcourier.com/Walter-Scott.\nBouquets of flowers, American flags, candles, stuffed animals and handwritten cards to Scott\u2019s family adorned the lot\u2019s chain-link fence.\nIt was exactly a week ago, on April 4, when Walter Scott was shot and killed while running from Michael Slager, a white North Charleston police officer who pulled over Scott for a broken brake light."}
