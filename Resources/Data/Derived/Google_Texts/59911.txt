Caleb loved everything about Christmas but he was taken too soon, just days before his favorite holiday. That's why Judy Thomas and her daughter organized a vigil to remember the ten-year-old boy.

"We want to remember Caleb but in turn we want it to be Christmas for Caleb."

In front of the Blansett home community members gathered around a tree put up in his honor. Grant Hutton, Caleb's friend, wanted to celebrate his friend. "He just wanted to have a good Christmas and he didn't want to be taken away," Hutton said.

In true holiday spirit, community members sang Christmas songs for little Caleb. An emotional evening for those who knew Caleb.

"It has been so heart wrenching. I've cried everyday about it. I love this little boy," a community member said.

And while little Caleb isn't physically here anymore Hutton said, "he can still be with us, he can still be here but he's just not going to be a person."

While families are sitting with their loved ones at home tonight the Wellington community took time to give Caleb a Christmas celebration.

"I know that from Heaven Caleb is going to see every bit of this and it's going to be a wonderful night," Thomas said.
