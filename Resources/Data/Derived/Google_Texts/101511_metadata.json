To be published later this year in the Journal of Medical Regulation, the \u201cCensus of Actively Licensed Physicians in the United States\u201d reviews data received in 2014 by the FSMB from the nation\u2019s state medical and osteopathic boards about the current supply of actively licensed physicians in the United States and the District of Columbia.\n\nKey findings of the 2014 Census include:\n\n\u2022 The total population of licensed physicians (916,264) has increased by 4% since 2012.\n\n\u2022 The nation, on average, added 12,168 more licensed physicians annually than it lost between 2012 and 2014.\n\n\u2022 The average physician is now older and still predominantly male, but increasingly female at entry level.\n\n\u2022 The number of actively licensed physicians who graduated from international medical schools, particularly those in the Caribbean region, is growing at a rapid rate.\n\n\u201cMarked changes have occurred in health care delivery in the United States with the implementation of the Affordable Care Act,\u201d said Humayun Chaudhry, DO, MACP, President and CEO and the FSMB. \u201cWith millions of newly insured Americans, the need for accurate data about the current and future physician workforce remains paramount.\u201d\n\nThe 2014 Census, the FSMB\u2019s third such census of actively licensed physicians, includes state-specific information and data-sets on an array of physician licensure information. In aggregate, the information offers a current snapshot of the health care workforce, including the number, gender, age, American Board of Medical Specialties (ABMS) certification and location by state of all physicians with an active license to practice medicine.\n\nOther findings of the 2014 Census include:\n\n\u2022 Both the aging population of actively licensed physicians and the shift in gender composition could have a considerable impact on health workforce planning for the future.\n\n\u2022 There continues to be great interest in U.S. citizens who receive their medical education abroad. The Census found that the number of actively licensed physicians who graduated from international medical schools, particularly those in the Caribbean region, is growing at a rapid rate.\n\n\u2022 The Census provides data on the distribution of physicians by state and the substantial variation that exists in the ratio of physicians to patients across states.\n\nAn advance copy of the \u201cCensus of Actively Licensed Physicians in the United States, 2014\u201d is available at www.fsmb.org/Media/Default/PDF/Census/FSMB_2014_Census_Article.pdf\n\n###\n\nAbout the FSMB\n\nAbout the Federation of State Medical Boards: The Federation of State Medical Boards (FSMB) is a national non-profit organization representing all state medical and osteopathic boards within the United States and its territories that license and discipline allopathic and osteopathic physicians and, in some jurisdictions, other health care professionals.
