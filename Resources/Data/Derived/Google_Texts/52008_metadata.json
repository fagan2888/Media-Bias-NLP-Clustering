But even if they did, would they snap up health coverage?\n\nThe answer to that question is one of the great unknowns as states prepare to roll out the exchanges, or marketplaces, which are a key feature of the Obama administration\u2019s health reform law.\n\nMillennials\u2019 participation in the insurance exchanges is considered crucial to the success of the Affordable Care Act, which requires that most Americans get health insurance or pay a fine.\n\nInsuring young, healthy people helps balance out the risk of covering older, sicker adults, experts say. But if America\u2019s 20- and 30-somethings don\u2019t sign up, the fear is that premiums could spiral out of control.\n\nOpponents of \u201cObamacare\u201d say young adults will end up paying higher premiums once the law takes effect.\n\nA study by the National Center for Public Policy Research, a Washington, D.C.-based conservative think tank, found that millions of young adults would be better off financially if they went without health insurance and paid the fine \u2014 $95 or 1 percent of income, whichever is greater, in 2014.\n\nEstimates of young adult participation in the exchanges are all over the board.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s fair to say most young people will buy coverage if they consider it to be affordable and/or necessary, but until we see premiums, I think it\u2019s going to be really difficult for young people to assess whether this is affordable relative to all the other expenses they have,\u201d said Linda Rowings, chief compliance officer for United Benefit Advisors, an employee benefits advisory organization based in Indianapolis.\n\n19- to 34-year-olds most likely to lack coverage\n\nYoung adults, ages 19 to 34, are more likely to be uninsured than any other age group, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.\n\n\u201cThe vast majority (of young adults) who are uninsured say it\u2019s because they can\u2019t find affordable coverage, and that\u2019s one of the reasons we\u2019re really excited about the changes coming with the Affordable Care Act,\u201d said Christina Postolowski, a senior policy analyst for Young Invincibles, a Washington, D.C.-based national advocacy organization.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, within the young adult population, certain demographic groups \u201ccould potentially benefit more,\u201d she added.\n\n\u201cFor example, nationwide, the uninsurance rate for white 18- to 34-year-olds is 21 percent, but for Latinos it\u2019s 47 percent,\u201d she said, and for blacks, it\u2019s 33 percent.\n\nBeginning in October, young people can use the new state health insurance exchanges to buy a private health plan, often with the help of federal tax credits, or enroll in Medicaid, if they qualify.\n\nYet only one in four young people (27 percent) is even aware of the exchanges. And among those who were uninsured for a period of time in the prior year, less than one in five (19 percent) know about the exchanges, according to a recent Commonwealth Fund report based on a March survey.\n\nHowever, the report noted, young adults recognize the importance of having health insurance. For example, more than two-thirds (67 percent) of 19- to 29-year-olds who are offered insurance through their jobs enroll in that coverage.\n\nMillions also took advantage of a provision in the Affordable Care Act that became effective in September 2010, allowing young adults under age 26 to stay on their parents\u2019 health plans.\n\nThe findings \u201cdispel the notion that young adults don\u2019t think they need health insurance,\u201d economist Sara Collins, vice president for affordable health insurance at The Commonwealth Fund, the New York-based health foundation, said at a recent media briefing. \u201cInstead, affordability is likely a major barrier,\u201d she said.\n\nOne young adult\u2019s quest for insurance\n\nDennis Byrd, 26, is director of business development at a tiny start-up company in Rockville, Md., that doesn\u2019t yet offer health insurance to employees.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s something we\u2019ve talked about; we just haven\u2019t jumped the gun on it yet,\u201d explained Byrd, who has had asthma since childhood. Byrd shells out about $50 a month just on inhalers.\n\nIn the interim, he\u2019s looking to buy his own coverage. He\u2019s priced individual policies starting at a low of $150 a month, but depending on the coverage, \u201cit can drastically go upward, especially with a pre-existing condition,\u201d he said.\n\nHe recently learned about the insurance exchanges and hopes to find suitable, affordable coverage.\n\nStarting in 2014, under the health reform law, health insurance plans can\u2019t refuse coverage or charge more because of a pre-existing condition. And young uninsured people like Byrd can use the exchange where they live to buy an individual health plan and potentially qualify for federal tax credits to help offset the cost.\n\nThose subsidies are available to people who make between 100 percent and 400 percent of the federal poverty level. In dollar terms, that\u2019s $11,490 to $45,960 for an individual.\n\nMillennials making more than 400 percent of the federal poverty level won\u2019t qualify for tax credits but may use the exchanges to shop for coverage. In states that have released information about health plan premiums, \u201crates are coming in relatively competitively,\u201d said Collins, the Commonwealth Fund economist.\n\nYoung people with very low incomes \u2014 up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level \u2014 may have still another option.\n\nIn 2014, 24 states and the District of Columbia will expand their Medicaid programs to cover low-income people, starting at age 19, based solely on income. If you\u2019re eligible, you will receive free or low-cost care and won\u2019t have to buy coverage through the exchange.\n\nThe Young Invincibles\u2019 Postolowksi estimated that 17 million of the 19 million currently uninsured young people between the ages of 18 and 34 could potentially qualify for tax credits through the health exchanges or Medicaid, if all states expanded Medicaid.\n\nStudent and dependent coverage\n\nYoung adults have a few other options for getting health insurance.\n\nCollege students can enroll in a student health plan through their school. Under the health reform law, most plans must meet the same requirements as other individual plans, meaning no annual limits or lifetime caps on coverage and no exclusions for pre-existing conditions, Postolowski said.\n\nOr, if they\u2019re under age 26, they can enroll in a parent\u2019s health plan if the plan provides dependent coverage.\n\nBeginning in 2014, there\u2019s a new wrinkle: Adult children can enroll in mom or dad\u2019s health plan even if they have an offer of coverage through their employer or through their school, Postolowski explained.\n\nThe health reform law also allows young adults under age 30 and some other people with limited incomes to buy what\u2019s called a \u201ccatastrophic\u201d health plan. These plans have lower premiums but higher deductibles and provide protection against a major illness or accident.\n\nByrd, the young asthma sufferer, understands the importance of having insurance and doesn\u2019t intend to drag his heels.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m learning as I get older to take these things more seriously,\u201d he said.\n\nMore information\n\nGo to Young Americans for Affordable Healthcare to calculate the cost of buying health insurance.\n\nTo read how to navigate the new health insurance exchanges, click here.", "article_metadata": {"Content-Source": "healthcom", "description": "Few uninsured young adults know about the state health insurance exchanges opening for business on Oct. 1, surveys show.
