The Office of International Education has also set up a Facebook page where students can check in.\n\n\u201cDU Health and Counseling is also providing 24/7 care and support to those who need it,\u201d Beaudoin said. \u201cAs we all know, one of the risks of sending students abroad is that they may find themselves in harm\u2019s way. We are proud of our students who navigate stressful and unexpected situations and emerge well-prepared for life as global citizens.\u201d\n\nDU community members who have concerns about travel or transit to and from Paris can utilize International SOS, DU\u2019s health and safety service, Beaudoin said. DU\u2019s membership ID is 11BSGC000067.\n\nThe State Department has asked that U.S. citizens in Paris who are safe call their families and that those Americans in France needing assistance should call 1-202-501-4444. Americans concerned about loved ones in Paris should call 1-888-407-4747.\n\nThe DU Twitter page will continue to update people about the university\u2019s students in Paris.\n\nElizabeth Hernandez: 303-954-1223, ehernandez@denverpost.com or @ehernandez", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "DU students studying abroad in Paris, Europe confirmed safe", "title": "DU students studying abroad in Paris, Europe confirmed safe", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/11/14/du-students-studying-abroad-in-paris-europe-confirmed-safe/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151113__20151114_A14_ND14PARISJUMPCUTp2-1.jpg", "height": 504}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151113__20151114_A14_ND14PARISJUMPCUTp2-1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-11-14T11:10:38+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-20T07:49:23+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "The university has 29 students studying now in France and 412 students studying throughout Europe, according to a University of Denver news release.\nFive out of five University of Colorado Boulder students studying abroad in Paris have also been accounted for, according to The Daily Camera.\nThe University of Denver confirmed on Saturday that all of its study-abroad in France and elsewhere in Europe are safe after the Friday terrorist attacks in Paris.\nThe DU Twitter page will continue to update people about the university\u2019s students in Paris.\nDU community members in Paris are asked to reach the Office of International Education at duabroad@du.edu."}
