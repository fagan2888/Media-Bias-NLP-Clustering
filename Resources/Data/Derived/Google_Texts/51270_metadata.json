She wanted to empower her staff to make decisions and to take more risks.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s scary to be innovative,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you\u2019re innovative and you make a mistake, we shouldn\u2019t punish that. We should learn from it and do it better next time.\u201d\n\nBaker thinks women in management bring different skills to the table. They\u2019re better multitaskers, she said, and can be better collaborators. \u201cPeople can learn these things. It can be taught,\u201d she said. \u201cI know some amazing male leaders who are very collaborative.\u201d\n\nBaker isn\u2019t the only new face at the top levels of county government. Two of her three assistant county administrators are women; like Baker, they both replaced men who had held their positions for more than 30 years.\n\nHeather Grimes succeeded Mike Nurrenbrock as assistant administrator for internal services. Grimes, who came from the male-dominated world of information technology, said she doesn\u2019t pay attention to gender roles.\n\nShe\u2019s the family breadwinner, and her husband manages the house and cares for their two kids.\n\nSuzanne Salichs took over the public services division after Dan Johnson retired and now oversees more than 400 employees, including parks, animal services and fire rescue departments.\n\nThough both were hired under Gallagher\u2019s watch, Baker played a key role in their selection. \u201cBoth of those were different,\u201d Baker said. \u201cHeather was a known entity. Everything John and I had asked her to do, she\u2019d done an outstanding job. So she was a logical choice.\u201d\n\nTo replace Johnson, they wanted someone who had the same \u201cpassion for public service\u201d as well as expertise in a few of the departments that fall under public services. Salichs\u2019 community development background fit the bill.\n\n\u201cDan had an accounting background,\u201d Salichs said. \u201cHe called himself a bean counter. I\u2019m not a bean counter.\u201d\n\nBaker also tapped women as directors of the county\u2019s budget office and its community services division, and she promoted longtime staffer Ed Caum to lead the county\u2019s tourism office. During the next few months, she expects to round out her leadership team with a new chief assistant, a development services administrator and the county\u2019s first full-time public information officer.\n\nBaker said that to change the culture in county government she had to start with changing the attitude management had toward its employees. It goes beyond pay raises, which county employees received this year after going five years without. She made it a priority to reward employees for good work. As administrator, she held \u201clistening sessions\u201d with each county department to hear their ideas and their gripes.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s genuinely trying to do the best she can for the employees,\u201d said Bruce Kennedy, the assistant county administrator for utilities.\n\nlkinsler@tampatrib.com\n\n(813) 371-1852\n\nTwitter @LKinslerTBO", "article_metadata": {"taboola-pub-time": "Sat, 14 Dec 2013 22:42:24 -0400", "Description": "NEW PORT RICHEY \u2014 Six months after her appointment as Pasco County administrator, Michele Baker is changing the culture of a county government that has been viewed by many as a good old boys", "og": {"site_name": "TBO.com", "description": "NEW PORT RICHEY \u2014 Six months after her appointment as Pasco County administrator, Michele Baker is changing the culture of a county government that has been viewed by many as a good old boys", "title": "New administrator cracks Pasco\u2019s glass ceiling", "url": "http://www.tbo.com/pasco-county/new-administrator-cracks-pascos-glass-ceiling-20131214/", "image": {"width": 3970, "identifier": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20131214/ARTICLE/131219503/AR/0/AR-131219503.jpg", "height": 2733}, "updated_time": "2013-12-15T00:00:00Z-04", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "tbo.com", "description": "NEW PORT RICHEY \u2014 Six months after her appointment as Pasco County administrator, Michele Baker is changing the culture of a county government that has been viewed by many as a good old boys", "title": "New administrator cracks Pasco\u2019s glass ceiling", "image": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20131214/ARTICLE/131219503/AR/0/AR-131219503.jpg", "site": "@TBOcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 522234267826834}, "msvalidate.01": "29E67031F86E7FB6DF9823924E21B8B4", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/tbocom", "published_time": "2013-12-14T22:42:24Z-04", "modified_time": "2013-12-15T00:00:00Z-04"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\u201cShe\u2019s genuinely trying to do the best she can for the employees,\u201d said Bruce Kennedy, the assistant county administrator for utilities.\nShe replaced County Administrator John Gallagher, who retired in May after 33 years at the helm.\nIt goes beyond pay raises, which county employees received this year after going five years without.\nHeather Grimes succeeded Mike Nurrenbrock as assistant administrator for internal services.\nNEW PORT RICHEY \u2014 Six months after her appointment as Pasco County administrator, Michele Baker is changing the culture of a county government that has been viewed by many as a good old boys\u2019 club."}
