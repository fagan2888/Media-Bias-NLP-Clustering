The North abruptly called off the official visit because it said the U.S. had ruined the atmosphere for talks by holding a drill over South Korea with nuclear-capable B-52 bombers.\n\nThe former NBA star insists that his purposes are entirely friendly. \"I just want to meet my friend Kim, the marshal, and start a basketball league over there or something like that,\" said Rodman, according to the AP.\n\n\"I have not been promised anything,\u201d he said in regards to the release of Bae. He reiterated, \"I'm not there to be a diplomat. I'm there to go there and just have a good time, sit with (Kim) and his family, and that's pretty much it.\"\n\nRodman first visited the secretive nation in February in order to promote basketball and film a documentary with Vice. Despite displeasure expressed by the U.S. government over the highly-publicized visit, Rodman insisted that he could \"show people around the world that we as Americans can actually get along with North Korea.\" During his visit, he befriended authoritarian ruler Kim Jong Un over their mutual interest in sports. He said the North Korean leader is \u201ca friend for life.\u201d\n\nRodman suggested after the visit that the White House should also try playing \u201cbasketball diplomacy,\u201d and that President Obama could \"pick up the phone and call\" Kim just to talk about sports.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "Basketball player Dennis Rodman made a trip to North Korea earlier today.
