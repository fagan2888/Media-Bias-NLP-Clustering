Terry McAuliffe's aggressive push to convince the General Assembly to expand Medicaid with Obamacare dollars, will come to a boil this year.\n\nAt the same time an unprecedented offer by state hospitals to kick in some of their money to a new health fund should keep the debate about health care for the uninsured front and center.\n\nIn the background is McAuliffe's bruising, two-year battle to expand Medicare and tap federal Affordable Care Funds to cover more than 350,000 uninsured, low-income Virginians \u2014 an effort adamantly opposed by the House of Delegates Republican leadership and almost all Senate Republicans.\n\nTwo measures seen as a financial hit on hospitals \u2013 ending the state's Certificate of Public Necessity (COPN) program that free-market advocates say protects medical monopolies, and a new assessment the hospitals themselves proposed as a way to to draw down more federal Medicaid dollars \u2013 could be the basis of a health care deal. Or they could simply clear the way for more political posturing.\n\n\"We're getting set for another year of gridlock with even more fireworks,\" said Stephen Farnsworth, a political scientist at the University of Mary Washington.\n\nThe reason, he said, is that House Republicans see the new assessment that hospitals proposed as part of \"McAuliffe's relentless push for Medicaid expansion,\" a push the hospitals have backed aggressively.\n\n2016 General Assembly Joe Fudge / Daily Press Outside view of the State Capital Building with George Washington on his horse to the right.

The idea is that using that money for some health care costs would mean a dollar for dollar match from the federal government \u2013 and a $9 for $1 match if the state expanded Medicaid.\n\n\"I do tilt at windmills, but I don't think I am going to this session,\" said Senate Finance Committee Chairman Emmett Hanger,R. Mount Solon, who was one of three Senate Republicans who tried, unsuccessfully, to find a compromise alternative to Medicaid expansion that would still let the state tap Obamacare funds last year.\n\nGeneral Assembly Joe Fudge / Daily Press Outside view of the State Capital Building.

(Joe Fudge / Daily Press) (Joe Fudge / Daily Press)\n\nIf the hospitals' proposed assessment isn't be going anywhere, ending the certificate of public necessity program may not either, Hanger believes. Many legislators, including him, have reservations about doing away with the program, he said.\n\n\"We have COPN for a reason,\" Hanger said. \"I know many here share my belief in free markets, but health care is not a free market. It's not: 'If you can pay you get care, and if you can't, you die.' We don't do that.\"\n\nEven if a bill ending the COPN program were to pass both House and Senate, Farnsworth says, McAuliffe is likely to veto it.\n\nBut Olusoji Akomolafe, head of the political science department at Norfolk State University, isn't so sure either idea is a non-starter.\n\n\"It is not unreasonable to assume that a compromise might be in the offing whereby the expansion is rejected as usual but in its stead, Republicans would most likely make provision to increase in some fashion or another the health care budget,\" Akomolafe said\n\n\"Should that be the case the Republicans' strategy to gut COPN may turn out to be a smart political move,\" he said.\n\nThe certificate of public necessity program is based on an obscure state law that says the health commissioner must approve before anyone builds or expands hospitals, outpatient surgery clinics, rehab and nursing facilities or diagnostic imaging services, such as MRIs.\n\nDeep down, the fight over the program is a battle over money.\n\nOn one hand, as the House of Delegates' Republican leadership argues, letting people freely compete for customers \u2013 patients, in this case \u2013 brings prices down.\n\nOn the other, the hospital association says, certificates of necessity keep businesses \u2013 including competing hospitals \u2014 from cherry-picking the profitable businesses that hospitals rely on to make up for losses on key services such as psychiatric care, obstetrics and charity care. Hospitals say they're forced to lose money because of federal requirements to provide emergency care and the tendency of Medicare and Medicaid to pay less than the real cost of care.\n\nThe COPN issue came to a head last year over a bid by the giant Hospital Corp. of America to build a freestanding emergency care center in New Kent County. To make the idea work, and provide the only such care in the county, HCA argued it needed MRI and CT imaging equipment.\n\nState health department staff said there was no need, since the 36 scanners in health planning district 15 \u2013 an 80-mile-long swath of central Virginia stretching from Goochland to New Kent Counties -- weren't busy enough.\n\nThe state health commissioner later gave a green light to the project \u2013 but the whole process bugged Del. Chris Peace, R-Hanover, who represents the county.\n\n\"Far too often, local communities are denied increased access to basic services such as outpatient emergency rooms, CT scanners or MRIs by healthcare regulators based on decisions made by unelected bureaucrats,\" he said.\n\nVirginia is one of 36 states that have some form of a certificate of need requirement.\n\nThe idea is to prevent hospitals and clinics from building more facilities than are needed, on the theory that the cost of unused beds and equipment would have to be covered by increasing charges actual patients must pay.\n\nBut the effect is to reduce competition, argues Del. John O'Bannon, R-Henrico, the House GOP's point man on health policy.", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Hospital issues at heart of General Assembly health debates", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Daily Press", "author": "Daily Press", "og": {"site_name": "dailypress.com", "description": "A long-simmering notion about hospital regulation, and a shorter-simmering resentment of Gov.
