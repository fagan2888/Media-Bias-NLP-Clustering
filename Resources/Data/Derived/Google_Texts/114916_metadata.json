John Kirby said earlier this week.\n\nOn Monday, Obama signaled the program may be due a look.\n\n\"There is a big difference between our military and our local law enforcement, and we don't want those lines blurred,\" he said. \"That would be contrary to our traditions.\"\n\nThe review, that has now been ordered, will explore whether such programs and funding are appropriate, whether state and local enforcement agencies have the necessary training and guidance after getting such equipment; and whether the federal government is sufficiently auditing the use of equipment obtained through federal programs and funding.\n\nWhite House staff -- including members of the Domestic Policy Council, the National Security Council and the Office of Management and Budget -- will lead the review in coordination with Congress, according to the official.\n\n--------------------------------------------\n\nBy Erin McPike\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2014 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.
