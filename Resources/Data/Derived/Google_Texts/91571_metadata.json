While current expectations are for the Federal Reserve (Fed) to modestly reduce the scale and scope of its bond purchases, more supportive economic data could materially change the speed in which the Fed executes its tapering and thus impact the yield curve and level of rates.\n\nWhile current expectations are for the Federal Reserve (Fed) to modestly reduce the scale and scope of its bond purchases, more supportive economic data could materially change the speed in which the Fed executes its tapering and thus impact the yield curve and level of rates. If labor market conditions continue to improve, how long can the Fed remain committed to keeping short term rates low? While the Fed has established an unemployment rate threshold before it plans on raising short term interest rates, the markets could challenge this commitment and cause further increases in rate volatility.\n\nWhile the Fed has established an unemployment rate threshold before it plans on raising short term interest rates, the markets could challenge this commitment and cause further increases in rate volatility.

The investment implications will likely be a continuation of the prominent themes in 2013: weaker yen, pressure on relatively weaker emerging markets, and outperformance by higher-quality European fixed income.\n\nOverall, 2014 will likely be a year of continued uncertainty in regards to economic and labor market conditions, the regulatory environment, and government policy, according to the Fidelity experts.\n\nWhatever the outcome, however, Fidelity predicts bonds should continue to play a critical role in an investors\u2019 overall asset allocation strategy. Bonds have many important features such as income generation, principal protection, diversification, and the ability to target specific liabilities. These characteristics can be beneficial to investors regardless of the market environment.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Bob Brown, president of the Bond Division at Fidelity Investments, and Jamie Stuttard, head of International Bond Portfolio Management, recently released a", "generator": "WordPress 4.3.1", "og": {"site_name": "IFAwebnews.com", "description": "Bob Brown, president of the Bond Division at Fidelity Investments, and Jamie Stuttard, head of International Bond Portfolio Management, recently released a video and thought leadership paper to hel\u2026", "title": "After 30 years of bull market, investors\u2019 love affair with bonds is not over", "url": "http://ifawebnews.com/2014/02/17/after-30-years-of-bull-market-investors-love-affair-with-bonds-is-not-over/", "image": {"width": 240, "identifier": "http://ifawebnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Brown-Bob_fidelity-e1392652290517.jpg", "height": 240}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://ifawebnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Brown-Bob_fidelity-e1392652290517.jpg?w=240", "card": "summary"}, "article": {"published_time": "2014-02-17T15:58:19+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-02-17T16:05:25+00:00"}, "verify-v1": "Fve8IDDdj94aX4Ar18+v33qGgAesGnY2YiqbnR5P17I="}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8a0e\"", "article_summary": "The factors likely to impact the bond markets and investors\u2019 decisions in 2014 can be varied and changing.\nIf labor market conditions continue to improve, how long can the Fed remain committed to keeping short term rates low?\nWhatever the outcome, however, Fidelity predicts bonds should continue to play a critical role in an investors\u2019 overall asset allocation strategy.\nThese characteristics can be beneficial to investors regardless of the market environment.\nBonds have many important features such as income generation, principal protection, diversification, and the ability to target specific liabilities."}
