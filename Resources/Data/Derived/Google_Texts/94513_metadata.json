Mark Pryor, D-Ark., on Friday unveiled a package of bills he said would encourage the creation of jobs in the U.S. and discourage American companies from sending jobs overseas.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been through a very, very difficult recession. We all know how hard the Great Recession has been on people, not just here in Arkansas but around the country,\u201d Pryor said in a news conference at the Little Rock facility of Custom Metals, a division of Little Rock-based steel construction company Lexicon Inc.\n\n\u201cOne of the reasons that our recovery has been so sluggish is because those middle-class jobs, a lot of them, just aren\u2019t here anymore,\u201d he said. \u201cThey can be here, but they\u2019re not here. As the economy gets rolling again, those jobs just a lot of times have been outsourced and they\u2019ve gone overseas.\u201d\n\nThe second-term senator, who is facing a tough re-election challenge from U.S. Rep. Tom Cotton, R-Dardanelle, touted three bills, one of which, titled the Bring Jobs Home Act, has already been introduced in the Senate by Sens. John Walsh, D-Mont., and Debbie Stabenow, D-Mich.\n\nThat bill would end corporate tax deductions for the moving expenses of companies that move facilities overseas and would give companies a tax write-off, plus an additional 20 percent tax credit, for the cost of bringing jobs back to the U.S.\n\nPryor said he is sponsoring a pair of bills to be introduced next week that would:\n\n\u2014Require federal agencies to use American-made materials in public buildings and public works projects, unless an agency obtains a waiver.\n\n\u2014Permanently extend the Build America Bonds program, which supports capital projects in states and communities, and allow the bonds to be used fund levees and flood control projects.\n\n\u2014Create a voluntary \u201cAmerica Star\u201d labeling program to identify products made in the U.S.\n\n\u2014Allow entrepreneurs to save up to $10,000 a year in a tax-free savings account for the purpose of creating a small business.\n\n\u2014Provide a 25 percent federal income tax credit for angel and venture investment in qualified small businesses, particularly in the areas of advanced manufacturing, aerospace, biotechnology, clean energy and transportation infrastructure.\n\n\u201cWe have a real chance to bring a lot of jobs back into the U.S., and of course I believe that a lot of those jobs would come back to Arkansas,\u201d Pryor said. \u201cThis is good for our workers, it\u2019s good for our companies and it\u2019s good for America.\u201d\n\nGrant Tennille, executive director of the Arkansas Economic Development Commission, spoke at the news conference in support of the legislation and said the AEDC worked with Pryor on the measures.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., has predicted the Bring Jobs Home Act would go nowhere, calling it \u201cdesigned for campaign rhetoric and failure.\u201d\n\nPryor said Friday he has been \u201cfocused on manufacturing for a long time, way before election year ever rolled around.\u201d He said he hoped the package of bills would pass with bipartisan support.\n\nPryor said he did not have an estimate of the cost of the proposals because the Congressional Budget Office was still studying them.\n\nDavid Ray, spokesman for Cotton\u2019s campaign, said Friday, \u201cIt\u2019s going to take more than putting stickers on products to create jobs in America. Our economy shrank by nearly 3 percent last quarter in part because Senator Pryor has spent the last six years supporting every job-killing measure President Obama has proposed, including Obamacare.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "LITTLE ROCK \u2014 U.S. Sen.
