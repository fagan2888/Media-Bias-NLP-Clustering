It's been nine years since we first started asking our readers who they thought were the best in the business. I guess you could say our awards are older than Obamacare.

Jokes aside, it's interesting to look at the evolution of the awards, the winners and the climate around them both. Some of the players have changed. A few haven't changed at all â€” in fact, should we rename the TPA award (like Hollywood) and call it the AmeriFlex Legacy Award?
