Here are the inactives and a few of the top storylines to follow in their Week 3 matchup:\n\nInactives: QB Trevor Siemian, FB James Casey, DE Kenny Anunike, CB Kayvon Webster, S Omar Bolden, G Shelley Smith and T Michael Schofield.\n\nCasey\u2019s first time on the inactive list is a sign the Broncos may plan to use more shotgun. If the Broncos do use a fullback, Virgil Green would be their man.\n\nBolden, who is dealing with plantar fasciitis, will likely be replaced by Andre Caldwell on kick returns and Josh Bush as backup safety.\n\nAnunike, who was listed as questionable Friday, will have to wait at least another week to make his regular-season debut after undergoing knee surgery in training camp. Coach Gary Kubiak said earlier in the week many would be game-time decisions, Anunike being one.\n\nAlthough he\u2019ll sit another week, backup linebacker Lerentee McCray will suit up for the first time this season after being inactive the first two games and dealing with a groin injury during camp.\n\nInactive for the Lions: WR Corey Fuller, LB, DeAndre Levy, DE Phillip Hunt, G/C Taylor Boggs, T Corey Robinson, TE Brandon Pettigrew and DT Jermelle Cudjo.\n\nThe Broncos\u2019 run game. It still feels awkward to utter the words: The Broncos, led by Peyton Manning, own the worst offense in the league. They\u2019re averaging a league-low 259.0 yards per game and have allowed the third-most sacks (tied) at seven. While the questions have focused more on Manning and his strength at age 39, many of the offense\u2019s struggles are due to the run game, or lack thereof.\n\nKubiak\u2019s zone-blocking system is designed to boost the running game. But it requires a line to work in unison to allow a quick and narrow break for a running back to bolt through. The line has struggled so far this season; the front five have played only two games together because of Evan Mathis\u2019 late signing. As a result, Manning has resorted to what he knows and does best: playing in shotgun, with no huddle.\n\nA compromise \u2014 running the ball out of the shotgun \u2014 may be in order, at least until the line is more comfortable and its technique sound. This may be as good a week as any to try, as the Lions\u2019 defense has allowed 147.5 yards per game on the ground, the fourth-most in the league.\n\nBroncos\u2019 secondary vs. Lions\u2019 receivers. At 29, Calvin Johnson hasn\u2019t produced the numbers he did in his prime. But at 6-foot-5, 237 pounds, his size and athleticism alone warrant extra attention. And now that he\u2019s paired with Golden Tate, the Lions boast one of the top receiving corps in the league.\n\nThe Broncos\u2019 defensive backs know this. Aqib Talib and Chris Harris haven\u2019t faced Johnson since 2011, when Talib was with the Bucs and Harris was a rookie. But they got a taste of the challenges he presents in coverage and they\u2019ve seen the damage he and Tate can cause together; last year, Johnson turned in 1,077 yards and eight touchdowns while Tate recorded 1,331 and four.\n\n\u201cAny time you have to go against Pro Bowl receivers, you have to step your game up another notch\u2014a Pro Bowl quarterback, too,\u201d Harris said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a challenge for all of us. They\u2019ve got their backs against the wall, so we know they\u2019re going to come out with their all and firing.\u201d\n\nWho will lead the Broncos? In Weeks 1 and 2, the defense has carried the Broncos. It\u2019s scored both game-winners \u2014 Talib\u2019s pick-six against Baltimore and Bradley Roby\u2019s scoop-and-score at Kansas City \u2014 and it\u2019s been the most consistent, and dominant, unit on the team. Manning led the Broncos on a 10-play, 80-yard drive in the fourth quarter against the Chiefs that will go down as one of his most memorable showings. But it didn\u2019t erase the first half, when the offense sputtered, and it didn\u2019t erase the three times Manning was sacked.\n\nThe Broncos\u2019 defense has held teams to a league-low 243.5 yards per game and has recorded seven takeaways, three in the red zone, their total in 2014. DeMarcus Ware and Von Miller have combined for 27 quarterback pressures. The Broncos, playing in Wade Phillips\u2019 3-4, have been unrelenting.\n\nDenver is 2-0, but the current model is unsustainable. The best defense cannot continue to carry the worst offense. Against Detroit, a clearer picture of the Broncos\u2019 balance, and identity, may come into view.\n\nHOW TO WATCH\n\nBroncos (2-0) at Lions (0-2)\n\nFord Field, 6:30 p.m.\n\nTV: NBC (KUSA-TV) \u2014 Al Michaels (play-by-play), Cris Collinsworth (color), Michele Tafoya (sideline)\n\nRadio: WestwoodOne Sports; KOA (850 AM), The Fox (103.5 FM)\n\nSERIES BREAKDOWN\n\nMeetings: 11\n\nBroncos record: 6-5-0 (Home: 3-2-0; Away: 3-3-0)\n\nLast game: Lions 45, Broncos 10 \u2014 Sports Authority Field, Oct. 30, 2011\n\nTim Tebow completed 18 of 39 pass attempts for 117 yards, one touchdown and one interception.
