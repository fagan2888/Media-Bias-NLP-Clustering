Our second show is in the can. Shane Vander Hart and Brian Myers had Sam Clovis, one of the six Republican candidates for U.S. Senate in Iowa, in the studio. He wants to go to Washington why would he want to do that? Has he donated to any Democrat candidates lately like another candidate who shall remain nameless? What did he think of Senator Ted Cruz’s filibuster of the debt ceiling vote? What’s his path to victory?

Listen in for a very special announcement… 2014 is a year of firsts for Caffeinated Thoughts.

Then… why would Wheaton College students protest a former lesbian feminist studies professor (now pastor’s wife) , Rosaria Champagne Butterfield, visiting their campus?

Listen below and be sure to share with a friend.

You can also check out our show first on Saturdays at 7:00a (CST) on KTIA 99.3 FM if you live in the Des Moines/Ames area or online right here.
