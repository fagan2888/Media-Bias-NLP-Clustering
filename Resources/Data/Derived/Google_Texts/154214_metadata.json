Jim Inhofe of Oklahoma and Ben Sasse of Nebraska pushed the Department of Justice to investigate whether the EPA \u201cknowing and willfully violated\u201d federal law.\n\nThe call for oversight comes as Republicans complain of ongoing executive overreach, fearing that without a push, the administration will continue to turn a blind eye on internal misconduct.\n\nThe letter follows a December 2015 report from the Government Accountability Office that found that the EPA violated anti-lobbying provisions by spending tax dollars to persuade Congress and the public to support proposed WOTUS regulations.\n\nThat conclusion stems from EPA activity during their blitz to crowd source support for the rule. The government agency launched Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube campaigns to counter Republican opposition to WOTUS, the New York Times reports.\n\nIn addition, the EPA also employed a social media platform called Thunderclap to solicit comments favorable to the rule.\n\nLater, EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy used this solicited support in an attempt to sway Congress back in March of 2015. Before the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, she testified:\n\nWe have received over one million comments, and 87.1 percent of those comments\u2026are supportive of this rule. Let me repeat: 87.1 percent of those one-plus million are supportive of this rule.\n\nAccording to the GAO, the activity violated the Anti-Deficiency Act\u2014which prohibits the use of tax dollars without Congressional authorization\u2014and therefore constituted illegal \u201ccovert propaganda.\u201d\n\nThe Anti-Deficiency Act stipulates that any violating agency must conduct its own internal investigation to identify those responsible\u2014individuals who could be subject to a $5,000 fine and 2 years in prison.\n\nBut the EPA insists their activity was all a regular part \u201cof a far reaching effort to educate the American public.\u201d\n\nThe senators charge that the EPA hasn\u2019t been sufficiently responsive and are asking that the Department of Justice open their own investigation \u201cto determine if any crime has occurred.\u201d\n\nIn a joint statement, Sasse criticized the EPA for thinking \u201cit can stonewall\u201d and Inhofe blasted the agency for thinking \u201cit can break the law and illegally spend taxpayer dollars.\u201d Sasse continued:\n\nDespite the fact that the Government Accountability Office found that they broke federal law by running a covert propaganda campaign to support their sweeping WOTUS rule, the EPA has doubled down on their lawlessness. It\u2019s time for the Department of Justice to investigate.\n\nThe letter represents the latest Republican volley in an ongoing battle over the WOTUS rule.\n\nAdvocates contend it would ensure clean water for public and environmental health. Opponents criticize the measure for expanding the federal government and threatening private property rights.\n\nLast week, Obama vetoed a proposal passed under the Congressional Review Act that would have scrapped the measure altogether. Republicans also tried, and failed, last December to gut funding for rule during the end of the year spending bill.\n\nThe rule still isn\u2019t in effect, however. In October, the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals temporarily blocked the WOTUS rule.\n\nDisclosure: Philip Wegmann\u2019s brother, James Wegmann, is communications director for Sen.
