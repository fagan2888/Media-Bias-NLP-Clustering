It was something more profound. He lost his wife of 67 years. Then he lost his daughter. He was looking for something to fill the empty hours.\n\n\u201cI was getting a little lazy at home, and I decided I\u2019d go down to the exercise club,\u201d he recalled.\n\nThat was more than three years ago, when Clark was 98. As he turned 102 last week, Clark was able to curl\n\n40 pounds, work out vigorously on a rowing machine and deftly pluck bouncing eight-pound kettle bells from the air with the hand-eye coordination of a much younger man.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a tenacious son of a gun,\u201d said Thom Hunter, Clark\u2019s 70-year-old personal trainer at the Sport&Health club in the Lakeforest section of Gaithersburg, Md. \u201cThey built them tougher in those days. He doesn\u2019t say he can\u2019t do it until he tries and sees he can\u2019t.\u201d\n\nIn a single 151-pound package, Clark embodies some of the greatest hopes and concerns that public health experts have for the fitness and health of the \u201colder old,\u201d the growing population of people over 85. Clark has significantly improved his strength, balance, endurance and range of motion over the past three years, staving off frailty, possibly saving untold medical costs and proving that gains can be made at any age.\n\nBut there are far too few like him.\n\nAccording to the National Institute on Aging, only 11 percent of people 85 and older engage in any regular exercise, despite clear evidence that the vast majority could work out safely, particularly if shown how. Fewer than 15 percent of people 65 and older do any regular strength training, at a time in life when sarcopenia \u2014 the natural decline in muscle mass and strength \u2014 contributes to some of the most troubling, and preventable, conditions of old age.\n\n\u201cIf I had to do only one thing for the frail older person, it would clearly be weightlifting exercises, and not any other form of exercise,\u201d said Maria Fiatarone Singh, a professor at the University of Sydney School of Medicine, who has been studying the value of strength exercises for the elderly for the past quarter of a century.\n\nIn 1988, Singh and her colleagues put older people who were in nursing homes on an \u201cintense\u201d (for them) resistance program and soon doubled and tripled their strength. In 2003, another of her studies showed that a year of weightlifting after a hip fracture \u2014 one of the most debilitating injuries of the very old \u2014 reduced nursing home admissions and mortality by more than 80 percent compared with other therapies. In 2012, a program of balance exercises and strength training significantly reduced falls among older people, according to another of her studies.\n\nSingh said she believes that more than 80 percent of people 85 and older could safely work out, and Tom Prohaska, dean of the College of Health and Human Services at George Mason University, said studies show that 95 percent of all older people can safely exercise, including those with arthritis, hypertension and heart disease.\n\nMany people don\u2019t realize that problems they associate with old age actually are caused by poor fitness, experts say, and many others simply don\u2019t know how to get started. \u201cIf you\u2019re 85, where do you turn to exercise?\u201d asked Scott Trappe, director of the human performance laboratory at Ball State University. \u201cMost people don\u2019t know how to exercise, and if you\u2019re 85, where do you go?\u201d\n\nSingh lays more blame on the medical community, which, she said, hasn\u2019t sufficiently incorporated regular exercise into its treatment of older people.\n\nAccording to a video presentation on the Go4Life Web site of the National Institute on Aging, sarcopenia can lead to osteoporosis, falls, obesity, difficulty climbing stairs and rising from a chair and lower tolerance for heat and cold, among other problems. Yet, simple weight-bearing exercise is quite effective in slowing and reversing it.\n\n\u201cAt first glance, it may seem impossible, [but] it\u2019s really quite feasible,\u201d Singh said.\n\n\u201cExercise is really, really, really powerful\u201d medicine, Trappe added. \u201cAnd if done right, it can have some great effects.\u201d\n\nTo watch Clark move around the gym during his weekly half-hour workout is to understand what is possible for the oldest members of society, as well as the adaptations that must be made for them.\n\nHe warms up for 3 minutes 30 seconds on a rowing machine, not a treadmill, because it works both his upper and lower body. He does 10 reps with 60 pounds on the \u201cpullover\u201d machine, catches and hoists the bouncing kettle bells, then moves 60 pounds 10 times on the \u201cseated row\u201d apparatus. His pushups are done leaning against the steel bar of a weightlifting rack. Then he scoots part way under the bar and does a version of a pull-up.\n\n\u201cWe have no mercy,\u201d Hunter said.\n\nBut he does, of course. As Clark walks the floor of the large health club, he places one hand lightly on Hunter\u2019s shoulder for balance. Hunter is more careful with Clark\u2019s hydration than he might be with a younger client. He repeatedly offers Clark water during breaks between exercises.\n\nAfter three years, Hunter is no longer trying to build Clark\u2019s strength or improve his balance, though the pair is still working on Clark\u2019s flexibility. Now the task is mostly preserving Clark\u2019s abilities, to help ease and slow the inevitable physical decline that comes with age.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re looking to do is maintain the muscle mass he does have, maintain or increase his range of motion and to maintain his balance,\u201d Hunter said.\n\nClark quit school to help support his family during the Depression and spent most of his life as a mechanic, including a period when he helped build P-47 fighters during World War II, according to his son, Dennis Clark, 72, who works out at the same club. Ray Clark retired in New York in 1976. His wife died in 2007 and his daughter passed away in 2009.\n\nDuring parts of his career, Clark toted a 40-pound tool box to work on New York\u2019s subways, and played some baseball in industrial leagues, but he never worked out in any systematic way until Dennis and his wife, Joan, brought him to see their personal trainer, Hunter.\n\nRay Clark was overwhelmed at first, but soon became inspired. He is on his third pacemaker, is losing his eyesight to macular degeneration and has difficulty hearing. But working out is something he can do.\n\nIn addition to the weekly sessions with Hunter, he does pushups off the kitchen island at the home he shares with his son and daughter-in-law in Montgomery Village. He takes walks around the cul-de-sac with a walker and recently covered a few blocks without it.\n\n\u201cIt gives him a lot of confidence,\u201d Dennis Clark said of his father\u2019s exercise routine. \u201cThat confidence that he has, you can\u2019t replace that.\u201d\n\nIt also wears him out. After a recent Friday workout, Clark had only one plan.\n\n\u201cI think I\u2019m gonna go home,\u201d he said, \u201cand do nothing.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://health.heraldtribune.com/files/2013/12/MISFITS-cropHF.jpg"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}, "description": "102-year-old embodies hopes, concerns that public health experts have for \"older old\u201d"}, "article_summary": "\u201cHe\u2019s a tenacious son of a gun,\u201d said Thom Hunter, Clark\u2019s 70-year-old personal trainer at the Sport&Health club in the Lakeforest section of Gaithersburg, Md.\n\u201cI was getting a little lazy at home, and I decided I\u2019d go down to the exercise club,\u201d he recalled.\n\u201cIt gives him a lot of confidence,\u201d Dennis Clark said of his father\u2019s exercise routine.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re 85, where do you turn to exercise?\u201d asked Scott Trappe, director of the human performance laboratory at Ball State University.\nAfter three years, Hunter is no longer trying to build Clark\u2019s strength or improve his balance, though the pair is still working on Clark\u2019s flexibility."}
