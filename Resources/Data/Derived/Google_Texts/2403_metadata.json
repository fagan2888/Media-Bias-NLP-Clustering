Shane Aguirre, R-Tupelo. \u201cThere has been a lot of hurrying up and waiting, but everybody has been very friendly and very cordial.\n\n\u201cBut I know that will change soon.\u201d\n\nAguirre, who represents District 17 in Lee County, Rep. Jay Hughes, D-Oxford, Rep. Rob Roberson, R-Starkville, and Sen. Chad McMahan, R-Guntown, are the only new legislators for the new four-year term representing portions of Northeast Mississippi.\n\nThey were sworn in Tuesday \u2013 the opening day of the 2016 session \u2013 with the other 28 legislators who represent portions of Northeast Mississippi.\n\nThe work of actually taking up legislation is expected to begin soon. But first, the Legislature\u2019s two presiding officers, Speaker Philip Gunn in the House and Lt. Gov. Tate Reeves in the Senate, must make committee assignments. That process might be delayed until two election challenges \u2013 one in each chamber \u2013 are decided in the coming days.\n\nStill, the new members said the first week was hectic.\n\n\u201cThe first week has been busy \u2013 meeting my colleagues\u2026finding the bathrooms,\u201d joked McMahan. \u201cI have been busy acclimating myself to the Capitol and finding out where all the facilities are.\u201d\n\nAs far as the session, McMahan said, \u201cI would like to see some tax reform this year. I also would like to see some investment in education.\u201d\n\nMcMahan, who represents the bulk of Lee County and a portion of Itawamba, said he also would focus on trying to help secure state funding for the planned Vietnam War Memorial at Veterans Park in Tupelo. The plan is to build a replica of the Vietnam War Memorial in Washington, D.C., which McMahan said is one of the most visited sites in the nation\u2019s capitol. He said such a memorial would be a big draw for Tupelo.\n\nAguirre said he is working on health care legislation.\n\n\u201cI am like a kid on Christmas morning,\u201d said Hughes, whose district consists solely of a portion of Lafayette County. \u201cThis is a wonderful opportunity, and I can\u2019t wait to see what is under the tree in terms of policy opportunities to help the state.\n\n\u201cWe have opportunities to excel all over the place. I am proud to have a seat at the table.\u201d\n\nHughes said he would focus on education.\n\nAs far as specific bills, he said he would file legislation:\n\n\u2022 To make all school superintendents appointed and increase their required levels of experience and education.\n\n\u2022 To have open primaries so voters can cross party lines.\n\n\u2022 To make all local offices, such as circuit clerks and sheriffs, non-partisan.\n\nHe said there is not a Republican or Democratic way for a coroner to handle his or her duties.\n\nHughes also said proudly he would file a resolution congratulating the University of Mississippi, which is in his district, for winning the Sugar Bowl.\n\nHughes defeated incumbent Brad Mayo, R-Oxford, while McMahan defeated incumbent Nancy Collins, R-Tupelo. Aguirre replaced incumbent Brian Aldridge, R-Tupelo, who opted not to run for re-election.\n\nRoberson is representing newly created District 43, which consists of portions of Oktibbeha and Winston counties\n\nFamily members and others were at the Capitol Tuesday for the swearing-in ceremony. Nearly 30 people traveled from Lee County for McMahan\u2019s swearing-in.\n\nMcMahan said he plans to have a ceremonial swearing-in ceremony at 6 p.m. Jan. 29 at the Guntown City Hall with a reception to follow in the Guntown Community Center.\n\n\u201cIt will be an opportunity for working people to come out and visit with me and have input,\u201d he said.\n\nMcMahan said for the time being, he plans to remain a member of the Guntown Board of Aldermen to save the expense of a special election. The courts have ruled that people could serve in the Legislature and on city governing boards because both positions are legislative. A person could not, for instance, serve in the executive position of mayor and in the Legislature.\n\nHughes has resigned from the Oxford Board of Aldermen.\n\nbobby.harrison@journalinc.com\n\nTwitter: @bobbyharrison9", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Northeast Mississippi Daily Journal", "description": "By Bobby Harrison Daily Journal Jackson Bureau JACKSON \u2013 Northeast Mississippi\u2019s new legislators said they enjoyed their first week of the 2016 legislative session, but hope to begin the work of legislating soon. \u201cIt has been overwhelming,\u201d said Rep.
