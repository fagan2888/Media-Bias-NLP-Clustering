Most people believe Apple should comply.\n\nBut the FBI is demanding a lot more than the data on a single phone. It has obtained a court order requiring Apple to build custom surveillance software for the FBI \u2013 which computer security expert Dan Guido cleverly dubs an FBiOS.\n\nOnce that software exists, it is inevitable that other law enforcement agencies will approach Apple seeking to get it to use the FBiOS to unlock iPhones in other investigations. Already, Apple says it has received U.S. court orders, under the same legal authority, seeking to get it to unlock 12 other devices\n\nIn effect, the FBI is asking for Apple to write software that will provide something the government has sought without success for more than a decade: A \u201cbackdoor\u201d that cracks the increasingly sophisticated encryption on consumers\u2019 phones.\n\nThe government has previously attempted to create its own \u201cgolden key\u201d that could unlock every device. That effort collapsed in the face of fierce objections across the political spectrum. Now, the government is pushing a private company \u2013 Apple \u2013 to create a key.\n\nWhat\u2019s at stake in this clash of titans, therefore, is a much larger issue: How far should tech companies go to help the government conduct surveillance of their users.\n\nThe court has asked Apple to build special software that would disable the security on the device, and to install that software to the target iPhone as an update. Once the phone is updated with the new software, the FBI will be able to break into it.\n\nLast year, a White House working group examined just this approach to creating a backdoor into encrypted devices \u2013 which it described in typically dense bureaucratic language as \u201cprovider-enabled remote access to encrypted devices through current update procedures.\u201d\n\nTranslated into English, they were considering using the routine updates that every phone receives as a means for law enforcement to plant spyware that could track everything on the device, from whereabouts to text messages to all emails.\n\nThe panel saw a potentially fatal flaw in this approach, noting it \u201ccould call into question the trustworthiness of established software update channels.\u201d\n\nThis is no small thing: software updates are key to cybersecurity. Updates are issued regularly to patch the inevitable flaws that are discovered in today\u2019s complex software. Failing to install software updates leaves users\u2019 vulnerable to hackers. The lack of timely software updates, in fact, has forced the U.S. military to turn off certain features of its non-battlefield smartphones.\n\nIf Apple gives its stamp of approval to the FBiOS and the technique becomes common, phone users may start to wonder whether the updates they receive contain spyware.\n\nIn addition, Apple says the FBiOS would \u201cbe relentlessly attacked by hackers and cybercriminals\u201d hoping to obtain a copy of the golden key. The government counters that Apple can install the software on the device at Apple\u2019s physical premises. Apple will \u201cretain control over it entirely,\u201d and is free to destroy it afterwards, the government states.", "article_metadata": {"description": "For years, the government has sought a \"golden key\" that can unlock our devices.
