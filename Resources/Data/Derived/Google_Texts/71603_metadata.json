(AP) - ART the Dalmatian lights up the day with a white glow, the night with color - just as art shines in many hues in many places.\n\nAt 19.5 feet of solid white fiberglass, ART is larger than life and spectacular on his foundation outside Shreveport Regional Arts Council Central ARTSTATION headquarters.\n\n\u201cWe hope he will become a landmark, and encourage people to have their pictures made with him,\u201d said Brandon Oldenburg, who, with Bill Joyce and Moonbot Studios artists, designed the dog.\n\nThe sculpture will be formally unveiled Nov. 6. The event is part of the Shreveport Common POP UP! week planned by Downtown Development Authority.\n\nART is the sculptural brain child of the Academy Award winning Joyce and Oldenburg, said SRAC executive director Pam Atchison.\n\nThe two presented the design as a commemorative housewarming gift to SRAC, the artists who inhabit the former Central Fire Station and populate Shreveport Common and fans who share the experience. The image was fabricated by JunoWorks, of Denver, through a grant from the Educational Foundation of America.\n\n\u201cHe is designed as a tribute to the Dalmatian that has become iconic to firefighters,\u201d said SRAC executive director Pam Atchison.\n\nThe solid white sculpture is covered in iconic dots that each light up when the dot donor\u2019s name is selected from a key board.\n\n\u201cART will have a programmable light show each evening, with seasonal colors for holidays,\u201d explained Atchison.\n\n\u201cThe sculpture is transformed as the evening comes at sunset. He is illuminated and the spots\u2019 design is a round form,\u201d said Oldenburg.\n\n\u201cAs the newest friend of the SRAC, ART guards the renovated and repurposed fire station from his post on Crockett Sreett, outside the Engine Room,\u201d said Atchison.\n\n\u201cHe is the guard dog,\u201d said Oldenburg.\n\nMuch care and attention went into the process of designing what we feel is a beautiful design, said Oldenburg.\n\nFor the deisgners, ART is playful and elegant.\n\nFirst Joyce, Oldenburg and the Moonbot team studied Dalmatians for several months before deciding on a pose.\n\n\u201cThe \u2018Eureka\u2019 moment came when Joyce realized that the Dalmatian featured in the old RCA Victrola photograph titled, \u2018His Master\u2019s Voice,\u2019 captured the combination of the historic restoration of Central Fire Station and the essence of a Dalmatian that listens to the forces of artists at work,\u201d said Atchison.\n\nThe model for ART was based on a photo session with Bill McFadden\u2019s dog, Jonathan.\n\n\u201cWe went to artspace and they had him jump on a wall, sit, stand,\u201d said McFadden about Jonathan.\n\nART is adorable and interactive.\n\n\u201cAnd, playful,\u201d commented Oldenburg.\n\n\u201cHe will serve as a beacon for all the arts in the community.\u201d\n\nHe still needs your dots and spot to light up his corner of the world.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Times, http://www.shreveporttimes.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "ART the Dalmatian lights up the day with a white glow, the night with color - just as art shines in many hues in many places.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/nov/2/arts-community-adopts-dalmatian-statue/", "site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "type": "article", "description": "ART the Dalmatian lights up the day with a white glow, the night with color - just as art shines in many hues in many places.", "title": "Arts community adopts Dalmatian statue"}, "twitter": {"description": "ART the Dalmatian lights up the day with a white glow, the night with color - just as art shines in many hues in many places.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Arts community adopts Dalmatian statue"}, "Author": "MAGGIE MARTIN", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe4099\"", "article_summary": "First Joyce, Oldenburg and the Moonbot team studied Dalmatians for several months before deciding on a pose.\nThe solid white sculpture is covered in iconic dots that each light up when the dot donor\u2019s name is selected from a key board.\nAt 19.5 feet of solid white fiberglass, ART is larger than life and spectacular on his foundation outside Shreveport Regional Arts Council Central ARTSTATION headquarters.\nART is the sculptural brain child of the Academy Award winning Joyce and Oldenburg, said SRAC executive director Pam Atchison.\n(AP) - ART the Dalmatian lights up the day with a white glow, the night with color - just as art shines in many hues in many places."}
