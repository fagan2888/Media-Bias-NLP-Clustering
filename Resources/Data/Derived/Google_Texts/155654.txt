This is completely, barking insane:

I don't even know how to react to this stuff anymore. A solid majority of Republicans wants to impeach President Obama for....what? An EPA regulation they don't like? Postponing Obamacare's employer mandate for a year? Not prosecuting some immigrant kids who have been in the country since they were three?

This goes beyond politics as usual. It's nuts. Fox News is now officially in charge of one of America's two major political parties.
