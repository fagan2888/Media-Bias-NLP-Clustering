And I think it\u2019s going to be about my illegally stashed weapon, or the pot brownie someone planted on me, and instead he or she will say, \u201cHey! What\u2019s it like to get your face bitten off by Robert De Niro?\u201d I\u2019m sorry, is that a security question? I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s not.\n\nA week before Cape Fear came out, I went on David Letterman\u2019s show. In Cape Fear, I played Lori, the jilted colleague of Nick Nolte who is attacked by Max Cady (Robert De Niro) after he picks her up in a bar. In the pre- interview for Letterman, I went over all my questions with the producer, but when I sat down, Letterman surprised me out of the gate by going off script and asking, \u201cSo what\u2019s it like? Having Robert De Niro beat the crap out of you?\u201d\n\nAnd people always get an interesting look on their face when they ask me. Like I\u2019m going to offer up some amazing insight. Something profound: \u201cHe covers himself with soot ashes, then incants the words of Stanislavski, An Actor Prepares.\u201d Something mystical: \u201cHe only works at sunrise, with his body facing east.\u201d Something ridiculous: \u201cWell in between takes of getting beaten up we did Three Stooges routines.\u201d I\u2019ve always thought that if I did say any of those things except for the last one, which is actually true, people would smile knowingly at me and say, \u201cYes. That\u2019s what I thought.\u201d\n\nPeople\u2019s curiosity about this matter is a testament to one of our greatest living actors, and since it\u2019s my legacy forever to be the girl who got her face bitten off by him in Cape Fear, I\u2019m going to try to answer the question. So what is it like to work with Robert De Niro?\n\nTo give this some context, I\u2019m going to go back to acting school\u2014 that first acting school I went to, where the headmistress thought I had no future. I heard that she was later run over by a bus. I had nothing to do with it, of course. But maybe just as she couldn\u2019t see my huge talent right in front of her, she couldn\u2019t see that enormous bus coming at her, either. My friend and fellow acting student was Elias Koteas. Elias is a wonderful actor who has created some edgy performances in films such as Crash, The Thin Red Line, and Zodiac. He is very serious, and he had a lot of ambitions, but his main ambition back then was to be in a movie with Robert De Niro, hopefully one directed by Martin Scorsese. He was obsessed with all things Robert De Niro. I mean, he would make me eat at the Belmore Cafeteria, because \u201cThat\u2019s where Travis Bickle ate in Taxi Driver.\u201d When I told Elias that I had never actually seen Taxi Driver, he was outraged and dragged me to a double feature of Mean Streets and Taxi Driver so that I could experience the genius of his favorite actor, Robert De Niro. I remember coming out into the light after seeing both films back to back and thinking, Jesus, I want my mommy! Take me to see Lassie Come Home or a Danny Kaye musical. Life can\u2019t be that dark. Elias just laughed. He was wearing an army jacket and contemplating getting a Mohawk at the time. (I\u2019m kidding.)\n\nPart of the reason Elias thought it was his destiny to work with Robert De Niro was that Elias bore a striking resemblance to him. He had all his mannerisms down, too, which made the comparison more obvious. He was not above stalking him, either. Elias started lurking around the set of The King of Comedy, which was filming near our school, trying to get spotted by De Niro so he could hopefully get a part in the movie purely based on their resemblance. Now, unbeknown then to Elias, The King of Comedy is a movie about a stalker and Elias was spotted by De Niro, and he actually thought he might be a stalker, and someone from production told him to get the hell away from the set. This, of course, thrilled Elias. It was a sign that it was only a matter of time before he fulfilled his destiny and worked with De Niro for real.\n\nI just wanted to be in show business. I thought my destiny was to do comedy. Be on a sitcom. At the time, I couldn\u2019t dream a dream big enough that included working with Robert De Niro or Martin Scorsese. I was a comedian. How would I ever in a million years end up working with Robert De Niro or Martin Scorsese? After I was in The Last Temptation of Christ, New York Stories, Goodfellas, Guilty by Suspicion, Cape Fear\u2014 five movies in a row, all with Martin Scorsese or Robert De Niro\u2014 I ran into Elias, and he good-naturedly accosted me. \u201cYou!\u201d he said. \u201cHow did you end up with my life?\u201d\n\nElias did eventually work with Marty on Shutter Island, and I was thrilled for him.\n\nIt was early in 1989 that I first met Robert De Niro. It was right after the premiere of New York Stories. I was in a dark hall on my way to Martin Scorsese\u2019s apartment to discuss being in a movie called Wiseguys, later changed to be called Goodfellas. At the time, Marty was living in a very tall, very modern building on West 57th Street named Metropolitan Tower, nicknamed the Razor Blade Building. The elevator that took you to his penthouse apartment on the seventy-fifth floor was so fast it was like a rocket launch. After you lurched to a stop and got off , the effect was always the same: complete disorientation, nausea, and confusion about which dimension you were in. Everything was pitch-black, as if you were in an air raid, so your eyes had to adjust like a raccoon\u2019s as you made your way down the hall. There was also this loud screeching sound\u2014 day and night\u2014 that Marty assured me was the wind whistling through the glass and steel, but it made you feel as if the building were going to crash to the ground.\n\nSo, there I am, making my way down the dark hall, and the wind is blowing like a haunted mansion at Knott\u2019s Scary Farm\u2014Marty\u2019s Spooky Hallway Ride\u2014 and who did I see coming the other way but Robert De Niro. There was no official word that Robert De Niro was in the movie, or even considering being in the movie, so I got a secret little thrill that maybe that\u2019s why he was leaving Marty\u2019s. I smiled politely at him as I passed by and respectfully and quietly said, \u201cHello.\u201d He politely nodded back, said, \u201cHello,\u201d and we both kept walking. I did notice that he was wearing large horn-rimmed glasses that I thought made him look very sophisticated. Like Clark Kent. It was a good look.\n\nMarty opened the door for me, and I said, \u201cI just said hello to Robert De Niro. Does that mean he\u2019s going to be in the movie?\u201d\n\nAnd Marty looked a little concerned and said, \u201cYou recognized him?\u201d\n\nI laughed, and said, \u201cOf course. He\u2019s Robert De Niro!\u201d\n\nAnd he said, \u201cBut he was wearing a disguise.\u201d\n\nAnd I said, \u201cMarty, he was wearing glasses.\u201d\n\nAnd Marty said, \u201cI know, he thinks that\u2019s a disguise.\u201d\n\nAnd I said, \u201cWell, you might want to tell him it\u2019s not working, because he looks like Robert De Niro with glasses on.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m not sure if Marty did tell him, but I never saw him wear those Clark Kent glasses again.\n\nThe casting of Goodfellas was top-secret stuff. I was privy to hearing about and sometimes even seeing every actor or actress that was even in consideration, but I was sworn to secrecy. Listen, I knew that I was in consideration, and Marty wouldn\u2019t confirm or deny if I was going to be in the movie, and we were in a relationship. That\u2019s how top-secret it was! There was a building excitement that Marty would be reunited with both Joe Pesci and Robert De Niro, but names like Tom Cruise, Bruce Willis, and John Malkovich were also being mentioned. I let the De Niro casting issue drop, but it did not seem accidental that The Godfather had paid Marty a visit.\n\nThe next time I saw Robert De Niro was on the set of Goodfellas. I became a fixture on set, sitting quietly behind or near Marty absorbing everything that happened on what is often called the best film of the \u201990s. I was afraid not to go, because I would miss something. One day they were shooting at the Copacabana, which was near my apartment, and Marty said, \u201cWe\u2019re doing something pretty interesting today. You should come down and see it.\u201d\n\nIt was of course the famous Steadicam shot entering from the back of the restaurant. Another day we were jammed into the Hawaii Kai on Broadway. It was ancient, and inside everything was made of straw and grass. Marty said, \u201cCareful, this place has fleas\u201d\u2014 and let me tell you, it did. I was at a booth watching Joe Pesci and Ray Liotta act the \u201cBut I\u2019m funny how? Funny like a clown?\u201d scene. And then there was Mr. De Niro. Word was spreading about Goodfellas, and actors, mobsters, you name it were requesting if they, too, could come down just to get a glimpse of Robert De Niro. In some neighborhoods a carnival-like atmosphere developed and folks were having cookouts and sitting in lawn chairs outside places where they were shooting. It was like they were a part of the atmosphere and Marty harnessed that energy and put it into the film.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to explain the impact of Robert De Niro at the time he and Marty were making Goodfellas. He was a god in New York. I mean, there were actors\u2014 Vincent Gallo, for one\u2014 who had agreed to be extras just to brag that they were in Goodfellas with him. I had just been watching and had been happy with that, but now I was going to be in a few scenes with him. In one scene, I was going to have a line right before his. Elias was right. How did I end up with his life?\n\nMarty created an atmosphere on the set that was fun and homey, like a large Italian family, but the scenes with De Niro always changed that dynamic. His presence brought a tension and energy that I had never experienced before or have since. When he walked on set everyone stopped talking, and it was like, boom, something important is about to happen. We were shooting the famous Christmas scene in the bar where Robert De Niro chews out Johnny Roastbeef for having bought a new Cadillac. All of Brooklyn was outside cheering\u2014as I\u2019ve said, people were having barbecues and drinking wine and applauding every time an actor walked into or out of the bar. It was past midnight, but nobody wanted to leave. When they were shooting that scene and De Niro opened the door and revealed the Cadillac there were hundreds of people to the side that the camera had to avoid. Inside I had a front-row seat watching Robert De Niro. Enough time to get pretty nervous because my first line in Goodfellas was coming up. We had been shooting in the bar a few days, and there was going to be this very long, complicated tracking shot, with most of the cast involved, and I had a line during it to Julie Garfield, which was \u201cIf I even look at anyone else, he\u2019ll kill me.\u201d The camera then holds for our reaction, and then moves on to De Niro and Joe Pesci, and the scene continues. It was like an eight-minute shot. We rehearsed it almost all day. Finally Marty said they were ready to shoot. And even though I had told myself, Don\u2019t screw this shot up. Don\u2019t do anything phony. Don\u2019t do anything that makes Robert De Niro go over to Marty and say, \u201cHow did that bad actor get in my movie?\u201d I didn\u2019t quite pull it off. The first stupid thing I did was to try to get a laugh. I thought, Let me goose my one line in the scene like a bad actor. So the camera is tracking along, there are twenty people in the frame, all these actions. Out of the corner of my eye I see the camera getting to me, and all of a sudden I become Eve Arden. \u201cIf he catches me with anyone, he\u2019ll kill me!\u201d then I downed a glass of wine to button it. It was dreadful, of course, awful and hammy. I knew it immediately, and so did Marty. He yelled out, \u201cCut. Cut. Technical difficulties.\u201d Everyone started groaning. Everyone else had been brilliant. Marty came over to me and whispered into my ear so no one could hear it but me: \u201cDon\u2019t do that again.\u201d Then he laughed, \u201cSorry, everyone, sorry,\u201d running back to the camera, \u201cOur fault. Our fault. Technical problems.\u201d Twenty-thousand dollar mistake, Marty later told me. He never let anyone know but me, but he cared enough that he wanted every actor in the frame to be perfect.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Even better than acting with De Niro was making him laugh.
