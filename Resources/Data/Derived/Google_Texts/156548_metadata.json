Boehner\u2019s home in Washington, setting up a Thanksgiving dinner table which they said highlighted illegal immigrants who are being deported and won\u2019t be with their families during the holiday this year.\n\nAfter the vigil, activists went to the Capitol complex where 11 of them \u2014 some U.S. citizens and some so-called Dreamers, or young illegal immigrants trying to gain full legal status \u2014 were arrested for civil disobedience.\n\nOne woman who spoke at the vigil outside Mr. Boehner\u2019s house is here illegally and said she was trying to get her deportation halted.\n\n\u201cNext week is Thanksgiving, where families are reuniting to celebrate. Mine possibly will be separated tomorrow,\u201d the women, Ana Canenguez, said in a statement issued by activists. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be separated from my children.\u201d\n\nMr. Boehner\u2019s office declined to comment on the protest.\n\nMr. Boehner last week seemed to close the door on chances for an immigration bill to pass this year when he said the House would work on its own timeline and would not enter into negotiations with the Senate, which has passed a single broad bill legalizing illegal immigrants and rewriting the legal immigration system.\n\nHouse Republicans are instead working on a series of smaller bills, including ones to stiffen immigration enforcement, rewrite guest-worker programs and require tougher border security.\n\nMr. Cantor is also working on a long-awaited bill, deemed the Kids Act, that would grant legal status to the young illegal immigrants, known as Dreamers, who are considered among the most sympathetic in the immigration debate.\n\n\u201cThe leader has repeatedly said he believes children, who know no other country, and are here at no fault of their own, should be able to remain here,\u201d said Rory Cooper, a spokesman for Mr. Cantor. \u201cIf Democrats end their my-way-or-the-highway approach on immigration reform, it would help get something done towards that end.\u201d\n\nSenate Majority Leader Harry Reid has said that he won\u2019t pass an immigration bill unless it includes a broad pathway to citizenship for most illegal immigrants, which House Republicans have rejected. They say a massive program sounds too much like Obamacare, and they instead want to tackle the issue piece-by-piece.\n\nWhile Wednesday\u2019s protests focused on House GOP leaders, some activists are increasingly targeting President Obama, who they say is deporting record numbers of illegal immigrants.\n\nThis week a number of activists chained themselves to a bus in Chicago to try to halt deportations of two high-profile illegal immigrants that the activists say are being separated from their families unfairly.\n\nImmigration authorities counter that the two men were both deported before and snuck back into the U.S., and each have since been convicted of other crimes: One was convicted of fraud, and the other of shoplifting.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Activists said that illegal immigrants were arrested while protesting outside of House Majority Leader Eric Cantor's office on Wednesday in the latest escalation of civil disobedience designed to pressure Congress to legalize them.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Activists said that illegal immigrants were arrested while protesting outside of House Majority Leader Eric Cantor\u2019s office on Wednesday in the latest escalation of civil disobedience designed to pressure Congress to legalize them.", "title": "Illegal immigrants arrested protesting at Capitol", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/nov/20/illegals-arrested-protesting-capitol-hill/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2013/11/19/immigration-protestjpeg-09d6f.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2013/11/19/immigration-protestjpeg-09d6f.jpg", "description": "Activists said that illegal immigrants were arrested while protesting outside of House Majority Leader Eric Cantor's office on Wednesday in the latest escalation of civil disobedience designed to pres", "card": "summary", "title": "Illegal immigrants arrested protesting at Capitol"}, "Author": "Stephen Dinan", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Politics, Social Issues, Eric Cantor, John A Boehner"}, "article_summary": "After the vigil, activists went to the Capitol complex where 11 of them \u2014 some U.S. citizens and some so-called Dreamers, or young illegal immigrants trying to gain full legal status \u2014 were arrested for civil disobedience.\nActivists said that illegal immigrants were arrested while protesting outside of House Majority Leader Eric Cantor\u2019s office on Wednesday in the latest escalation of civil disobedience designed to pressure Congress to legalize them.\nWhile Wednesday\u2019s protests focused on House GOP leaders, some activists are increasingly targeting President Obama, who they say is deporting record numbers of illegal immigrants.\nThis week a number of activists chained themselves to a bus in Chicago to try to halt deportations of two high-profile illegal immigrants that the activists say are being separated from their families unfairly.\nMr. Cantor is also working on a long-awaited bill, deemed the Kids Act, that would grant legal status to the young illegal immigrants, known as Dreamers, who are considered among the most sympathetic in the immigration debate."}
