Independent producers and agents.\n\nIn fact, more than 60 percent of FIA sales came from independent producers and agents last year, far and away the dominant distribution channel for FIA sales.\n\nNow, the low. When measured by product category, about 88 percent of independent producers\u2019 and agents\u2019 fixed annuity sales come from FIAs.\n\nAs far as FIAs are concerned, the independent producer sales channel has almost reached saturation point, according to Beacon Research.\n\n\u201cUnless this channel expands, higher sales of FIAs will have to come from somewhere else,\u201d said Beacon Research CEO Jeremy Alexander in a recent briefing on the 2016 outlook for fixed annuity sales.\n\nKey Distribution Channel Shrinking\n\nFIAs allow owners to benefit from gains when markets rise, but limit exposure to losses when markets fall.\n\nFor a baby boomer in retirement, many financial advisors agree that FIAs have their place. FIAs\u2019 explosive growth adjacent to the humdrum performance of the rest of the fixed annuity world -- beset by low interest rates and stagnant sales -- make them superstars by comparison.\n\nWhen FIAs hit the market more than 15 years ago, independent producers and agents were just about the only sales distribution channel in town. In 2002, only independent producers and captive agents were selling FIAs.\n\nBut the producer and agent channel, still a sales locomotive for FIAs, has been shrinking faster than the polar ice cap ever since. Independent broker-dealers (IBD), banks and even a wirehouse or two have warmed to FIA sales and are eroding independent producers\u2019 market share.\n\n\u201cNow you are seeing carriers, banks and BDs see that penetration,\u201d Alexander said. \u201cThat's the story happening in the index world.\u201d\n\nYet, even as more distribution channels get into the FIA distribution game, none are as aggressive about, or as reliant on selling FIAs as independent producers. That means FIAs could see slower future growth unless the competing channels boost FIA sales.\n\nSince total sales of fixed annuities aren\u2019t growing, the only way for this market to grow is to start seeing other channels embracing FIAs, Alexander said in an interview Tuesday with InsuranceNewsNet.\n\nThe question is will other channels step up? Will captive agents, banks and savings and loans, regional broker-dealers and IBDs pick up the slack?\n\nOther Channels to the Rescue?\n\nCaptive agents derive about a quarter of their sales through FIAs. But they accounted for less than 10 percent of all FIA sales at the end of the third quarter last year, and remain under the control of life and annuity carriers.\n\nIf carriers want to quash FIA sales for regulatory or financial reasons, captive agents have no choice but to follow suit.\n\nCould IBDs and banks emerge as white knights and sell more FIAs?\n\nThey, too, have their drawbacks.\n\nAbout 70 percent of all fixed annuity sales closed by IBDs are FIAs, according to Beacon. In many instances, insurance carriers own the IBD and IBDs can control the distribution of annuity sales if they want, Alexander said.\n\nIn the heavily regulated bank channel, more than 30 percent of fixed annuity sales consist of FIAs, but the bank channel makes up less than 20 percent of all FIA sales by distribution.\n\nBesides, banks can get awfully skittish when dealing with index-linked products that take on more risk and aren\u2019t insured by the U.S. government.\n\nFIAs, too popular and lucrative to ignore, will see more growth in other distribution channels, Alexander said, but by how much and to what extent is another question as money flows back and forth between fixed and variable annuities.\n\nIndexed annuities are on the verge of becoming \u201cmainstream,\u201d if they aren\u2019t already, and that means they are getting a temporary lift from boarder the market forces: lower variable annuity sales, stock market volatility and even the U.S. Department of Labor\u2019s fiduciary rule proposal.\n\nNow it\u2019s up to the distribution channels to fight over FIAs, if distributors are serious about claiming their share of the spoils in one of the few growth stories of the fixed annuity market.\n\nInsuranceNewsNet Senior Writer Cyril Tuohy has covered the financial services industry for more than 15 years.
