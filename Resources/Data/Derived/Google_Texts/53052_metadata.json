Nobody is going to think ill of politicians trying to beat up a drug thug like Shkreli.\n\nWhat Shkreli did is despicable, but there\u2019s an aspect to this that is being ignored. Some of Congress\u2019 biggest donors are doing essentially the same thing.\n\nPharmaceutical companies are raising the prices of their drugs to astronomical levels \u2014 perhaps not as high as Shkreli, but for the same reason \u2014 and few in Congress seem as outraged by that as they are with Shkreli.\n\nHard to accept that these imbeciles represent the people in our government. \u2014 Martin Shkreli (@MartinShkreli) February 4, 2016\n\nAmerican drug prices are among the highest in the world, and they\u2019re going higher.\n\nCongress has explicitly prohibited Medicare from negotiating drug prices with pharmaceutical companies. About 40 million people get their prescriptions this way.\n\nAbout 20 brand-name prescription drugs have at least quadrupled since December 2014, while another 60 medications have seen their prices more than double in the same time period, Bloomberg reports.\n\nAARP says the price of generic drugs, which have generally done most of the work to keep drug prices lower, have spiked.\n\nPrice spikes aren\u2019t a new phenomenon, says Stephen Schondelmeyer, an expert on drug policy and pricing at the University of Minnesota, who coauthors AARP\u2019s drug pricing reports. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen drug companies raise prices before when new regulations come along. We saw it when Medicare Part D was implemented. We saw it back when Medicaid rebates were implemented. We\u2019re seeing it now partly because of the regulatory changes associated with the Affordable Care Act. Drug companies drive the prices up when they\u2019re worried about the effect of new regulations.\u201d But some experts say the recent sharp spikes have all the earmarks of price gouging. \u201cYou\u2019ll see a particular dosage of a medication shoot up while other dosages remain the same,\u201d says David Belk, a physician in Alameda, Calif., who hosts a website called True Cost of Healthcare. \u201cSometimes you\u2019ll see prices spike up suddenly, stay high for a month or two, and then drop down again, for no reason.\u201d But as long as drugmakers aren\u2019t colluding in raising prices, experts say, there\u2019s nothing illegal about jacking up prices.\n\nIt\u2019s not the drug companies\u2019 fault, argues Rafi Mohammed, a \u201cprice strategy consultant\u201d, in the Harvard Business Review.\n\n\u201cAmericans need to take some responsibility for deciding how drug prices are set, and they need to ask the larger question for the future: how should future pharmaceutical advancements be funded?\u201d he says.\n\nI believe in the free market and rarely advocate any type of price regulation. There are compelling reasons, however, to consider doing so for pharmaceuticals. The biggest expense of a new drug is R&D; once developed, the cost of producing pills is relatively trivial. Most important, everyone in the world can \u2013 and should \u2013 benefit from pharmaceutical advancements, especially since the variable costs are so low. In other words, the R&D behind new drugs is a common good. Typical solutions to the dilemma of high drug prices include single payer (e.g., U.S. government negotiates \u201ctake it or leave it\u201d prices for its territory) and price regulation (e.g., the government simply specifies prices). These tactics will lower prices but don\u2019t address the issue of paying for new pharmaceutical developments. How can we make sure that the cost of developing new drugs is equitably split among the various beneficiaries around the world? That high-price-paying Americans are not essentially subsidizing R&D for pharma multinationals? A tethered price regulation is the answer. Regulators could pass a law that says neither American insurers nor government agencies would pay more than a set percentage above (or below) what other developed countries pay for drugs. In other words, our prices are tethered to theirs. This accomplishes two goals. First, drug prices will be lowered for Americans. Second and just as importantly, pharma companies and other countries will be on notice that sick Americans are no longer going to shoulder a disproportionate share of drug development costs. Tethered regulation should apply only to new drugs, not existing drugs, which were developed with the understanding that U.S. prices will be as high as the market can bear. We made a bad deal, but we should keep our word.\n\nNot everyone is buying the idea that gouging consumers is the price of researching new drugs.\n\n\u201cWe have no rational system in the U.S. for managing prices of drugs,\u201d Dr. Peter B. Bach, director of Director of Memorial Sloan Kettering\u2019s Center for Health Policy and Outcomes, told CNN. Drug companies are charging more and more \u201cbecause they can.\u201d\n\nIn the United States \u201cwe don\u2019t have a central agency, governmental or NGO (non-governmental organization) that engages in comparative research that comes up with clear statements of drugs efficacies,\u201d Kesselheim added. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has no regulatory authority to do large comparative reviews of medications. North of the border, Health Canada, Canada\u2019s healthy ministry, has a drug review board that helps determine not only does a drug say what it will do, but how effective it is relative to what is already out on the market. This recommendation helps providers determine a price they are willing to pay for the drug. Bach, of Memorial Sloan Kettering, said that when buyers can say no, for whatever reason, they can control prices better. In fact, Bach\u2019s hospital refused the colon cancer drug Zaltrap in 2012 because it cost double that of a reasonably good alternative, Avastin. The company that manufactures Zaltrap, Sanofi, worried that other cancer hospitals and doctors would follow suit, so it halved the price of the drug.\n\n\u201cThe current drug pricing model of year-after-year hikes is unsustainable,\u201d Jon Rother, the executive director of the Campaign for Sustainable Rx Pricing, wrote today . \u201cAmericans deserve better than deciding between taking their medicine as prescribed and paying bills. A new market with increased transparency and competition will finally put the health care market to work for patients instead of against them.\u201d\n\nThe people who showed up to get a little TV face time grilling Shkreli today are the ones who can eliminate the problem he represents any time they so choose.\n\nIt\u2019s a conversation they could have had today even if Shkreli kept his mouth shut.\n\nIt\u2019s even an issue that would be a good one in a presidential campaign.", "article_metadata": {"mpr-content-group": "newscut", "mpr-collection": "Politics", "WT.cg_n": "News Blogs", "WT.z_mpr-site": "news", "description": "It's easy to hate on Martin Shkreli, the smug kid who got rich quick by pricing pharmaceuticals at a ridiculously high price because he bought the rights to them.\r\n\r\nPoliticians in Washington got a crack at him today.
