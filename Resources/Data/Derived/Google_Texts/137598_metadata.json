David Simon argues that what we have are two America\u2019s the rich and the poor. Simon argues that the American people have a moral choice to make. Simon\u2019s argument is a choice between Laissez-faire economics or socialism and that is the basic premise behind his emotional plea. The arguments are a choice a moral choice\u2014are Americans all in this plight of life together or is each person on their own?\n\nWhat ever happened to the ideas about Social Darwinism? America is the way that it is today because of Social Darwinism! Socioeconomics in America are in a large part developed at the individual level and not the family or group level of society. Americans need to stop taking the easy way out of blaming race for why they continue to exist at the socioeconomic level that they do. The United States has been under the curse of affirmative action for fifty years now. After fifty years one would expect that it would be the white male that was without a job and in poverty.\n\nSimon argues that in politics it is the rich that control the politics in America. The idea is that the populace does not have complete control over who gets elected. The argument is that Congress and the President are elected by the interests of money and not of the people. This is a very good argument and there is a lot that can be said for money, politics and who wins a political race. However, studies tell a different story the Washington Post ran a column on the subject and came to the conclusion \u201cMoney doesn\u2019t dominate elections nearly as much as some of the news coverage would suggest \u2014 but in the right context, ads can still have very large effects.\u201d There are many reasons to think that money would matter, but there are good reasons to think that American\u2019s can see through advertising.\n\nIt is the contention of this article that money matters, but not in how much the candidates\u2019 spend on the election; money matters because most people vote on the premise of how much money the politician promises to redistribute or not. American politics more than ever today is a fight over redistribution and that is why there is so much obstructionism in Washington. The war is on\u2014in America between the have and the have-nots and those in between. The outcome of the battle will mark the direction that America walks in the future. Will America continue to be the land of opportunity or will it become the land of hand outs and stagnation?\n\nThe answer to the question above in regards to politics seeps through at the Local, State and Federal levels and this war is fought district by district and state by state. The Battlefield is Washington. The Executive, Congress, and Judicial structure developed by the United States Constitution mark the rules of conduct for the war for America\u2019s future. The big question is will Americans get sold on the ideas of morals? There are two different arenas for morals one is secular humanism and the other is religion. The question is what spectrum of American morality should carry more weight\u2014freedom and liberty or chains and punishment?\n\nLet\u2019s look at what is meant by chains and punishment. For the context of this article taxation is a punishment and mandates are chains. The Democratic Party is all about taxation and mandates while the Republican Party is about freedom and liberty. Some would argue that the previous sentence is not at all accurate and that the Democrats are about helping the poor and less fortunate. This is while the Republicans are all about not caring and not wanting to help the less fortunate. It is said that the Democrats want to give people benefits while the Republicans want to take benefits away.\n\nThe broad sweeping statements and perceptions painted above make the choices of who to vote for easy. A secular humanist is all about morality when it comes to other people\u2019s money. Yes, the secular humanist votes for the Democratic Party of tax the rich and give the money to the needy. However, when it comes to taking a dime out of their pocket or time out of their day\u2014in the mind of a secularist\u2014that job is supposed to be accomplished by the government. The idea is that the system and not the individual should worry about each citizen.\n\nA religious person on the other hand believes that it is their responsibility to give money to charities and time to the soup kitchen to help the less fortunate in the surrounding area. In fact, the United States is the most charitable nation in the world when it comes to helping other nation-states. This is because America is also the most Christian based nation in the world. The bottom line is that the religious Republican takes it upon them to help the people in need with their own money and time.\n\nThe two aforementioned paragraphs demonstrate the two moral perspectives of how and who should help the poor in America. The answer to the question is that Democrats favor government intervention and Republicans favor the individual or church effort. One would think that this should be the end of the argument but it is not. The Democrats have created this monster that they call the free enterprise system. It is the evil behind all of the misfortune in America. From the perspective of the evil mixed economy the Democrat figures out all the different methods to tax and mandate in order to create leveling.\n\nIt is in the above sense that Democrats control the people and take away their freedom and liberty. Let\u2019s face it if a person\u2019s money is taken through taxation they lose the freedom to spend that money. A person\u2019s liberty to acquire whatever they want to buy declines because the person no longer has the money due to taxation to buy what they want to buy. The Presidents socialist healthcare system mandates people to buy something that they may not want to buy or get fined. This is slavery you must buy healthcare or you will get the whip of a fine. However, this is how the socialist left wants to deal with the rich getting richer while the group of the poor is growing.\n\nThe Republican Party on the other hand try\u2019s to establish less government and less taxation for the people. This is in order to give the people more freedom and liberty the way that our Founding Fathers expected the country to operate. It should be noted that federal taxation was illegal until the Sixteenth Amendment in 1913. Republicans try to create a society that is conducive to a person\u2019s ability to start their own business, go to school, and do what they wish in America in order to better oneself.\n\nThe crux of the argument is that the Democratic Party hopes to bind people through socialism and the Republican Party wants to free the people through the free enterprise system. Some people will end up at the top and others will end up at the bottom. This is part of human existence. Secular Democrats that believe in Darwin should acknowledge the ideas demonstrated by Social Darwinism and embrace them.
