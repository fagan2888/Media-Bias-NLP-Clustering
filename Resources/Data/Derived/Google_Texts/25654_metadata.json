It\u2019s fair, given that clumping, to conclude that the race lacks a front-runner.\n\nBut there\u2019s a difference between a race without a clear front-runner and a race in which there\u2019s no discernible momentum among the top tier of candidates. And what we have is the latter, not the former.\n\nSen. Marco Rubio of Florida is the candidate trending up in that top pack. It\u2019s a trajectory he\u2019s been on since he announced his candidacy almost two months ago. Rubio\u2019s charisma, personal story and relative youth have combined to make him the \u201cit\u201d candidate for the GOP at the moment.\n\n[\u2018Wait your turn\u2019 is not in Marco Rubio\u2019s DNA]\n\nRubio has also been helped by the slippage of his two main rivals for the nomination: Jeb Bush and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker.\n\nFormer Texas governor Rick Perry is a Republican contender for the White House in 2016. Here's his take on guns, Obamacare and more, in his own words. (Julie Percha/The Washington Post)\n\nBush, who will finally announce his candidacy this week, weathered a very difficult past seven days \u2014 shaking up his campaign staff amid faltering poll numbers and whispers that his fundraising might fall short of its goals for the first six months of the year.\n\nWalker has largely stayed out of the glare of the national media over the past six weeks or so, but his brief appearance on the big stage earlier this year \u2014 think \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d if President Obama is a Christian \u2014 wasn\u2019t exactly confidence-inspiring for Republicans looking to see whether he is ready to take the helm.\n\nBeyond that top three, most unaligned Republican strategists we talk to \u2014 and there aren\u2019t many, since roughly 200 people are running for the GOP nomination \u2014 see a significant drop-off in the likelihood of any of the other candidates winning the nomination.\n\nThe most common name we hear as an alternative to the Big Three is Ohio Gov. John Kasich. And that\u2019s certainly possible, but Kasich remains in the very early stages of a candidacy (he\u2019s not announced yet), so we\u2019ll play a bit of wait-and-see for him.\n\nAdd it all up and you get Rubio, the youngest member of this massive GOP field, as a first among equals. For now.\n\nBelow are the 10 candidates seen as having the best chance of winding up as the GOP nominee. The rankings are determined by polling, conversations with Republican strategists and a pinch of our sense of things.\n\n10. Bobby Jindal. The governor of Louisiana is running: That we (almost) know for sure. The formal announcement is set for June 24 in downtown New Orleans. But Jindal\u2019s standing is his home state is dismal, and there\u2019s very little excitement about him in national GOP circles. His best hope is to hang around the race long enough that voters tire of their other options.\n\nOhio Gov. John Kasich speaks at an event at the Clark County Republican Party office June 11 in Las Vegas. (John Locher/AP)\n\n9. Rick Perry. The former Texas governor seems genuinely excited about his second run for president. He even ran onstage at a recent event in Iowa. It\u2019s somewhat surprising for a guy who once didn\u2019t really seem that interested in running for president and then, when he did run in 2012, ran a disastrous campaign. But Perry is the longtime governor of a huge state. And American politics loves a second-chance candidate, right?\n\n8. Chris Christie. The New Jersey governor and his team insist they are taking the long view on 2016. No, he isn\u2019t where they want him to be today, but regular people still aren\u2019t paying any attention and won\u2019t be for some time. Christie got some good news last week when the New Jersey state Supreme Court affirmed the legality of his cuts to the state\u2019s public employee pension fund. He\u2019s also staffing up.\n\n7. Mike Huckabee. The former Arkansas governor and 2008 Iowa caucus winner keeps litigating the culture wars \u2014 something the larger GOP probably doesn\u2019t want but still speaks to a key audience in the party, particularly in Iowa and South Carolina. Huckabee is the top claimant to the social conservative mantle in the field, and he\u2019s broadly popular in the larger GOP, but we\u2019re still waiting for him to show he\u2019s running the caliber of campaign that can actually win the nomination.\n\n6. Rand Paul. The conventional wisdom among the GOP smart set about the senator from Kentucky has changed completely since the start of 2015. At that time, there was a sense that Paul had a real chance at being the nominee based on his strong base among libertarian-leaning Republicans and his appeal to other, less-vocal GOP constituencies. But the heightened concern within the Republican rank and file about national security and terrorism badly complicates Paul\u2019s noninterventionist views. Even if Paul wins every libertarian vote in the race for the nomination, if he can\u2019t expand beyond that bloc, it won\u2019t be nearly enough.\n\n5. John Kasich. Nobody benefits from Bush\u2019s stumbles as much as the Ohio governor. Both are clearly running for GOP establishment support, and Kasich recently suggested his window is larger if Bush doesn\u2019t run strong. That\u2019s right. But we also have yet to see Kasich really debut on the national scene. And his 2000 presidential campaign was hardly a tour de force, ending shortly after it began.\n\n4. Ted Cruz. Here\u2019s what the senator from Texas has going for him: (1) unquestioned dominance in the tea party lane of the primary, (2) deeply committed supporters and (3) a group of well-funded super PACs backing him. In a very crowded field, that probably means Cruz will be able to stick around for a very long time. But if he ever makes it into a one-on-one fight with any of the people rated higher than him here (Nos. 1-3), it\u2019s still very hard to see him winning that battle.\n\n3. Scott Walker. Walker, as we mentioned above, has kept a low profile these past few months. What Walker does have is momentum in Iowa, where he and his team are \u2014 smartly \u2014 lavishing time and money. Iowa is a state that Walker probably has to win given that neither New Hampshire nor South Carolina seems like a natural fit for him. At the moment, he\u2019s probably the favorite to do just that.\n\n2. Jeb Bush. Bush\u2019s struggles mask the fact that he\u2019s still very likely to be the best-funded candidate in the field, and he\u2019s broadly liked within the GOP establishment. Put plainly: Republican power brokers aren\u2019t going to desert him until it\u2019s clear that his goose is cooked (or close to it). And there is so, so much time left in the nomination race. At this time in 2008, after all, we were talking about whether Sen. John McCain (Ariz.) was done for.\n\n1. Marco Rubio. Yup.\n\nAaron Blake contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Rubio, Bush and Walker are ahead of a pack of other contenders, but the field isn\u2019t tightening.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/chris.cillizza", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Rubio, Bush and Walker are ahead of a pack of other contenders, but the field isn\u2019t tightening.", "title": "The GOP field: We made a top 10 list, but really, at this point, it\u2019s just three", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/the-gop-field-we-made-a-top-10-list-but-really-at-this-point-its-just-three/2015/06/14/faecec8e-12a3-11e5-9518-f9e0a8959f32_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2015/06/06/National-Politics/Images/Botsford_JoniGOP_15_06_06_28491433624295.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@thefix"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/the-gop-field-we-made-a-top-10-list-but-really-at-this-point-its-just-three/2015/06/14/faecec8e-12a3-11e5-9518-f9e0a8959f32_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/chris.cillizza"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "eomportal-uuid": "faecec8e-12a3-11e5-9518-f9e0a8959f32"}, "article_summary": "But Jindal\u2019s standing is his home state is dismal, and there\u2019s very little excitement about him in national GOP circles.\nJohn Kasich.\nAdd it all up and you get Rubio, the youngest member of this massive GOP field, as a first among equals.\nJohn Kasich speaks at an event at the Clark County Republican Party office June 11 in Las Vegas.\nBush\u2019s struggles mask the fact that he\u2019s still very likely to be the best-funded candidate in the field, and he\u2019s broadly liked within the GOP establishment."}
