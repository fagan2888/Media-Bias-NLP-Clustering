WE ARE UNITED!!!!!\u201d\n\nHere is the photo as tweeted by a Mizzou group called the Legion of Black Collegians:\n\nWe are no longer taking it. It's time to fight. #ConcernedStudent1950 #MizzouHungerStrike pic.twitter.com/mnPZBviqJF \u2014 LBC (@MizzouLBC) November 8, 2015\n\nThe focus of the calls for Wolfe to resign is a hunger strike by Jonathan Butler, a University of Missouri graduate student.\n\nButler \u2014 who appears in the photo with the 32 players \u2014 wants to force Wolfe\u2019s resignation because of a handful of recent incidents which have occurred on the Columbia, Mo. campus.\n\nIn a letter to school officials posted on his Facebook page, Butler indicated that he began his hunger strike because someone in a pickup truck allegedly shouted a racist insult at a black student government member, because state law prevents Planned Parenthood from performing on-campus abortions and because someone drew a swastika with human feces in a dormitory bathroom.\n\nSome observers have suggested that the bathroom swastika may be a hoax. Why, law professor blogger Ann Althouse has asked, for example, would any dedicated racial supremacist create a swastika out of human feces?\n\nButler admits in the letter that none of the incidents he cites are Wolfe\u2019s fault. Nevertheless, Butler has concluded, \u201cas a collection of incidents at the university, they are his responsibility to address.\u201d\n\nThis summer, prior to Butler\u2019s decision to go on a hunger strike because of racism allegations, the graduate student\u2019s substantially different agenda focused on a change in University of Missouri policy which ended subsidized health insurance for graduate students. To Butler\u2019s chagrin, school officials also stopped offering certain grad student tuition waivers and tore down some graduate student housing.\n\nThe Columbia Daily Tribune shows a robust-looking Butler acting as a self-appointed \u201cchant leader\u201d during a \u201cday of action\u201d on Aug. 26. He carried a large bullhorn.\n\nSchool officials have said the Affordable Care Act \u2014 Obamacare \u2014 forced them to stop subsidizing grad student health insurance.\n\nButler\u2019s hunger strike has now reached a week in length. He swears he won\u2019t eat anything (including multivitamins) until Wolfe, the MU system president, resigns.\n\nWolfe met with Butler and a group of student leaders on Friday. In a statement, the top MU bureaucrat described Butler as an influential voice in the social justice movement. Wolfe also said he is worried about Butler\u2019s condition.\n\nGroups of protesters have marched across the University of Missouri campus for the last 6 days in response to Butler\u2019s ongoing hunger strike. The protesters are calling themselves Concerned Student 1950. (The name relates to the year the first black student matriculated at Mizzou.)\n\n\u201cRacism lives at the University of Missouri,\u201d a protester shouted during a typical day of protest, reports the Missourian.\n\n\u201cTwo black, female students \u2014 including myself \u2014 were called the n-word by four white males while being recorded outside of the rec center,\u201d another protester yelled while standing on a chair in a crowded dining hall.\n\nHere is Wolfe on Friday night attempting to address concerns about \u201csystematic oppression\u201d from some viscerally angry protesters \u2014 presumably students at Mizzou, the state\u2019s flagship university.\n\nsaw this last night but didn\u2019t have context. the system president. presented without comment. pic.twitter.com/KVGvf30vQp \u2014 El Flaco (@bomani_jones) November 8, 2015\n\nSeveral University of Missouri football players have tweeted support for Butler\u2019s hunger strike and for the protest movement including starting running back Russell Hansbrough, cornerback John Gibson III and injured running back Trevon Walters.\n\nNever thought I would be in place or time like this to actually make a difference. \u2014 Russell Hansbrough (@imthatnike) November 8, 2015\n\n@EdgeofSports has nothing to do with our coaches.

Thursday\u2019s loss pushed the team\u2019s record to 4-5 (1-5 in the SEC).\n\nMizzou\u2019s remaining games are against Brigham Young, Tennessee and Arkansas. The BYU game is on Saturday in Kansas City.\n\nFollow Eric on Twitter. Like Eric on Facebook.
