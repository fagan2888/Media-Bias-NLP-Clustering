The monster storm flooded 80% of New Orleans, and claimed more than 1,800 lives.\n\nThe 10 year anniversary is especially meaningful for one local family.\n\nAfter the devastating hurricane, they uprooted their lives and restarted here in Southern Colorado.\n\nIn a small strip mall on the northwest side of Colorado Springs, Robert Brunet, better known as Chef BB to his loyal customers, serves up food best associated with his home town of New Orleans.\n\n\"I feel like I\u2019m an ambassador for New Orleans here in Colorado Springs. We have the Mardi gras spirit here, we have the southern Louisiana cooking here,\" Brunet said.\n\nHurricane Katrina forced them to evacuate to Texas. They eventually ended up in Colorado Springs.\n\nIn 2010 Brunet bought a restaurant and named it for his mom. Momma Pearl's Cajun Kitchen opened in 2013, six years after the Brunet's first moved here.\n\n\"Use what you got to move forward and not let the past define you as a person but it defines the moment where you make the big decision in your life to move forward,\" Brunet said.\n\nHe remembers the devastating disaster every day, but Brunet and his family are proud they survived it and rebuilt their lives, in Colorado Springs.\n\nThe family says they are very grateful to the community and their customers for supporting them and their restaurant.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "video", "description": "The 10 year Hurricane Katrina anniversary is especially meaningful for one local family.
