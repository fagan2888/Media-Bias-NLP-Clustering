Holi Mela 2015—or the Festival of Colors—took place at the Hindu Temple of Kentucky on Sunday afternoon. The annual event is a spring festival with ancient Hindu roots, and although primarily celebrated in India, its popularity has spread to Asia, Europe and parts of North America.

The highlight of the afternoon is when willing participants gather in a large group and begin flinging, tossing, rubbing, blowing, and throwing, in every direction, various pastel powders until all involved resemble walking art. The thrown powder hangs in the air and slowly rains down as the energy of the crowd borders on a full-frenzy and participants chase one another.

The event was organized by the Louisville Hindi School and included participation from area schools like Manual High, North Oldham High and Meyzeek Middle. Hindi School teacher Prateek Gupta explained, "We would like to grow the festival each year to include more and more of the community and someday even have it on the Belvedere. The city of Louisville is ready to help us with that goal when we reach that point."
