On “The McLaughlin Group” recently, we panelists reviewed 2014 in the show’s 33rd annual “Year-End Awards.” Here are my takes on the best, worst and most outrageous people and stories of the year that just concluded:

Biggest Winner of 2014: The Republican Party.

Biggest Loser: President Barack Obama, repudiated in the midterm elections.



Best Politician: For the Democrats it was New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo; for the Republicans it was former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush.

Worst Politician: President Obama – he has great intelligence, but no political smarts or feel.

Most Defining Political Moment: President Obama saying in September that “We don’t have a strategy yet” for dealing with ISIS in Syria; also the events surrounding Michael Brown’s shooting in Ferguson, Missouri.

Turncoat of the Year: Comedian Bill Cosby who is, it turns out, not so funny and not such a good father.

Most Boring: Every member of Congress who is elected, but can’t or won’t do the job – especially former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada.

Most Charismatic: Still former President Bill Clinton.

Bummest Rap: That former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was somehow responsible for the Benghazi, Libya, consulate attack.

Fairest Rap: A tie between Russian President Vladimir Putin, whose authoritarian impulses were increasingly clear, and the deceptions that became evident in the Obamacare law.

Best Comeback: New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie.

Most Original Thinker: Jeb Bush ties with Elon Musk, the SpaceX founder and developer of Tesla.

Most Stagnant Thinker: Afton Burton, the woman who is engaged to marry Charles Manson, as if love conquers all.
