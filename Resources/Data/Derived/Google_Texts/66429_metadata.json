Instead, he reportedly will use the address both to look back on what he considers his administration\u2019s major accomplishments, and to discuss more broadly \u201cwhat we all need to do together in the years to come [to] guarantee an even stronger, better, more prosperous America.\u201d\n\nGiven that, we decided to look back at Obama\u2019s first address to a joint session of Congress, in February 2009 \u2013 a State of the Union speech in all but name. We wanted to see what his priorities were, how they compared with the public\u2019s priorities at the time, and what\u2019s happened on those issues in the years since. We looked at the three issues at the top of the public\u2019s list of domestic priorities for 2009, as measured by a Pew Research Center survey conducted in January of that year: the economy, jobs and terrorism. We also examined two other issues that Obama discussed at length in his speech that year: health care and education. (The Center will report data on the public\u2019s policy priorities for 2016 later this month.)\n\nEconomy and jobs\n\nFollowing the late 2008 financial crisis, what had been a mild recession was rapidly turning into the worst economic slump since the Great Depression \u2013 a fact Obama directly acknowledged. \u201cI know that for many Americans \u2026 the state of our economy is a concern that rises above all others, and rightly so,\u201d he told Congress. \u201cIt\u2019s the worry you wake up with and the source of sleepless nights.\u201d\n\nIn a Pew Research Center survey conducted three weeks before Obama\u2019s speech, 71% of Americans rated the economy \u201cpoor,\u201d and 80% said jobs were difficult to find. Little surprise, then, that 85% of Americans around that time said strengthening the nation\u2019s economy should be a top priority for the new president and Congress, and 82% said improving the job situation should be a top priority.\n\nAs it turned out, the U.S. economy began to recover that summer, although growth has been modest at best and the middle class hasn\u2019t seen much benefit. The unemployment rate, which peaked at 10% in October 2009, stood at 5% last month, its lowest level in nearly eight years. However, millions of Americans have left the labor force entirely, due to retirement, disability, despair at finding work or other reasons. The employment-to-population ratio, which was 60.6% in January 2009, bottomed out at 58.2% in the summer of 2011, and had recovered only to 59.5% by last month.\n\nPublic attitudes about the economy and job situation have improved since Obama\u2019s first speech to Congress. In a Pew Research Center poll conducted last month, 27% rated economic conditions excellent or good, compared with just 4% in the February 2009 poll. While 53% still say jobs are difficult to find (versus 41% who say jobs are plentiful), that split is similar to where the public\u2019s views stood just before the Great Recession.\n\nTerrorism\n\nSeven years ago, concern over the deteriorating economy displaced what had been the public\u2019s top priority for several years running, defending the country against terrorism. But terrorism was still the third-most frequently cited top priority, with 76% of Americans in the January 2009 poll citing it as such.\n\nWhile there haven\u2019t been any incidents of terrorism on the scale of the Sept. 11 attacks, there have been several significant ones, such as the Fort Hood shootings in November 2009 (in which 13 people were killed and 30 were injured), the April 2013 Boston Marathon bombing (three killed and an estimated 264 injured) and last month\u2019s shootings in San Bernardino (14 killed, not counting the two shooters, and 23 injured). And terrorists have launched several major attacks overseas, such as the series of coordinated attacks in Paris this past November.\n\nFor most of Obama\u2019s term, the public gave him fairly high marks on his handling of the threat of terrorism \u2013 peaking in May 2011, just after the killing of Osama bin Laden. But Obama\u2019s approval ratings on handling terrorism have fallen since, and took an especially precipitous drop after the Paris and San Bernardino attacks.\n\nHealth care\n\nAlthough reducing health care costs wasn\u2019t one of the highest-ranked public priorities as Obama began his term, 59% of people in our January 2009 poll did rate it as a top priority. And Obama made it clear in his speech to Congress the following month that health care reform would be a major first-term priority. Saying that \u201cthe crushing cost of health care\u201d contributed to home losses, business failures and bankruptcies, he told the assembled senators and representatives, \u201cWe can no longer afford to put health care reform on hold. We can\u2019t afford to do it. It\u2019s time.\u201d\n\nThe Affordable Care Act that Congress eventually passed in March 2010 was then and remains today one of the most controversial pieces of Obama\u2019s legacy. In April 2010, 40% of Americans in a Pew Research Center poll said they approved of the new law, while 44% said they disapproved of it. In July 2015, the most recent time the Center has polled on the law, the approve-disapprove split was 48%-49% \u2013 statistically even. (The law is most unpopular among Republicans; just last week the GOP-controlled Congress sent a repeal bill to Obama, who promptly vetoed it.)\n\nWhatever one\u2019s feelings about the health care-reform measure, more Americans are covered by some form of health insurance now \u2013 whether employer-provided, purchased on an exchange or obtained via Medicaid or Medicare \u2013 than when Obama took office. According to the Census Bureau, 16.1% of Americans (nearly 49 million) were uninsured in 2009; by 2014, the last year for which there are data, only 10.4% (almost 33 million) Americans lacked health coverage.\n\nEducation\n\nIn 2009, 61% of Americans rated \u201cimproving the educational system\u201d as a top priority, the fifth-highest rating among the 20 issue areas asked about. Obama in his 2009 speech also stressed the need to improve education in the U.S. \u2013 in his words, \u201cto ensure that every child has access to a complete and competitive education, from the day they are born to the day they begin a career.\u201d Along with supporting reforms at the elementary and secondary levels, Obama emphasized the importance of more Americans getting educated beyond high school, either at college or in career training.\n\nThe share of Americans ages 18 and older with at least some education beyond high school has risen since 2009, according to the Census Bureau \u2013 from 55% that year to 58% in 2014 \u2013 though that\u2019s a continuation of a trend that dates back to at least 2001. But student performance at the elementary and secondary levels hasn\u2019t changed much, according to data from the National Assessment of Educational Progress.\n\nThe share of eighth-graders scoring at or above the \u201cproficient\u201d level in reading went from 32% in 2009 to 34% in 2015, for instance, and the share scoring at or above proficiency in math went from 34% in 2009 to 33% last year. Among fourth-graders, 36% scored at or above the proficiency level in reading last year, versus 33% in 2009. For math proficiency, the shares were 40% and 39%, respectively.\n\nTopics: Barack Obama, Economic Recession, Educational Attainment, Health Care, National Economy, Terrorism, U.S. Political Figures", "article_metadata": {"description": "We look back at his first congressional address in 2009 - his priorities and those of the public, and what's happened since.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5", "og": {"site_name": "Pew Research Center", "description": "We look back at his first congressional address in 2009 - his priorities and those of the public, and what's happened since.", "title": "Before Obama\u2019s last State of the Union, a look back at his early hopes", "url": "http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/01/11/before-obamas-last-state-of-the-union-a-look-back-at-his-early-hopes/", "image": {"width": 420, "identifier": "http://www.pewresearch.org/files/2016/01/FT_16.01.12_SOTU_NAEP.png", "height": 378}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "We look back at his first congressional address in 2009 - his priorities and those of the public, and what's happened since.", "title": "Before Obama\u2019s last State of the Union, a look back at his early hopes", "url": "http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/01/11/before-obamas-last-state-of-the-union-a-look-back-at-his-early-hopes/", "image": {"src": "http://www.pewresearch.org/files/2016/01/FT_16.01.12_SOTU_NAEP.png"}, "site": "@pewresearch", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"project\": \"U.S. Politics\"}", "theme-color": "#231f20", "projects": "U.S. Politics", "date": 20160111, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/pewresearch", "published_time": "2016-01-11T10:01:53+00:00"}, "topics": "U.S. Political Figures", "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "Saying that \u201cthe crushing cost of health care\u201d contributed to home losses, business failures and bankruptcies, he told the assembled senators and representatives, \u201cWe can no longer afford to put health care reform on hold.\nWe also examined two other issues that Obama discussed at length in his speech that year: health care and education.\nTopics: Barack Obama, Economic Recession, Educational Attainment, Health Care, National Economy, Terrorism, U.S.\nPublic attitudes about the economy and job situation have improved since Obama\u2019s first speech to Congress.\nAnd Obama made it clear in his speech to Congress the following month that health care reform would be a major first-term priority."}
