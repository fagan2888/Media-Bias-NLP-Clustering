I\u2019m especially worried about whether we can hold on to the modest fiscal restraint (and sequester enforcement) we achieved as part of the 2011 debt limit fight.\n\nPart of that victory was already negotiated away as part of the Ryan-Murray budget deal, to be sure, but there are still remaining budget caps that limit how fast politicians can increase so-called discretionary spending.\n\nAccording to the Congressional Research Service, budget authority for defense is allowed to rise from $552 billion in 2014 to $644 billion in 2021. And budget authority for domestic programs is allowed to climb from $506 billion to $590 billion over the same period.\n\nI think that\u2019s too much spending, but the interest groups, lobbyists, cronyists, politicians, bureaucrats, and other insiders in Washington would like much bigger increases. And you won\u2019t be surprised to learn that the Obama Administration also wants to bust the spending caps.\n\nThis is why I\u2019m very worried that some Republicans are undercutting their negotiating position by saying that there will be no government shutdowns.\n\nLet me explain how these issues are connected. At some point next year, Republicans on Capitol Hill will be responsible for putting together spending bills for the following fiscal year. They presumably (or am I being too optimistic?) will put together budget bills that comply with the existing spending caps.\n\nObama will then say he will veto such legislation and demand that Republicans unilaterally surrender by enacting bigger spending increases and also gutting sequestration. The GOP will then have two options:\n\nA) they can surrender.\n\nB) they can continue to send the President spending bills that comply with the law.\n\nBut if they go with option B and the President uses his veto pen, then the government shuts down. And even though the shutdown only occurs because the President wants to renege on the deal he signed in 2011, Republicans are afraid they\u2019ll get blamed.\n\nThe Washington Post reports on this fearful attitude, citing the anti-shutdown perspective of the incoming Senate Majority Leader.\n\nA day after he won reelection and Republicans retook the Senate, Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) left no doubt\u2026 \u201cLet me make it clear: There will be no government shutdowns\u2026,\u201d McConnell said in a valedictory news conference in Louisville.\n\nBut that view irks some lawmakers who worry Obama will then have a blank check.\n\nThe first battle may revolve around immigration, but - as noted above - I\u2019m more focused on fiscal fights.\n\nBut McConnell could be tripped up by the same conservative forces that have undercut Boehner since he became speaker in 2011. The issue this time is Obama\u2019s expected executive action to overhaul the nation\u2019s immigration system. \u2026conservatives\u2026have urged McConnell and Boehner to fight back by allowing only a short-term budget bill that would keep government agencies open until early next year. These conservatives believe that once Republicans hold both chambers of Congress next year, they can force Obama to accept a budget bill that would prohibit him from implementing his executive order on immigration.\n\nAt this point in the article, the reporter, Paul Kane, engages in some anti-factual editorializing.\n\n\u2026the days of brinkmanship could return with a vengeance, and the government could once again be shut down. That could provide a devastating blow to Republicans, hurting their chance to win back the White House and hold on to their relatively slim Senate majority in 2016.\n\nHuh?!? Republicans just won a landslide, so why are we supposed to believe last year\u2019s shutdown was \u201ca devastating blow\u201d?\n\nMr. Kane also refers to a shutdown later in the article as a \u201cfiscal calamity\u201d even though he shows no evidence (because there wasn\u2019t any) that government shutdowns cause any damage.\n\nBut there is at least one person who is convinced by this narrative. And that person, Senator McConnell, is preemptively trying to convince other GOP Senators to give Obama the upper hand in any fiscal negotiations.\n\nMcConnell\u2019s advisers are worried enough that by Friday evening they were circulating a memo showing how damaging last year\u2019s shutdown was to the Republican Party \u2014 an effort designed to counter conservatives who point to this month\u2019s triumphant election as proof that the shutdown did little damage. \u2026The memo showed that in Gallup polling from late 2012 until this month, \u2026Republicans held steady just a couple of points lower through 2012 and most of 2013 \u2014 until the 16-day shutdown of the federal government in October 2013. In just a few weeks, the McConnell chart shows, Republican favorability plummeted 10 points. It has taken a year for it to climb back to where it was before the shutdown.\n\nBut who cares about \u201cfavorability\u201d ratings. The poll that should really matter to Republicans is the one that takes place on election day.\n\nAnd that seemed to be good news for the GOP.\n\nHere\u2019s some of what I wrote in my post about lessons that could be learned from the 2014 elections.\n\nBack in 2011, I explained that Republicans could play hard ball, largely based on what really happened during the 1995 government shutdown. And in 2013, I again defended a shutdown, pointing out that voters probably wouldn\u2019t even notice that some government offices were closed, but they would remember that the GOP was branding itself as the anti-Obamacare party. The establishment, by contrast, thought the shutdown was a disaster for Republicans. \u2026many\u2026Republicans felt the same way, excoriating Senator Cruz and others who wanted a line-in-the-sand fight over government-run healthcare. The moral of the story isn\u2019t that shutdowns necessarily are politically desirable, but rather that it\u2019s very important for a political party to find visible ways of linking itself to popular causes (such as ending Obamacare, fighting big government, etc).\n\nAt least one person agrees with me. Jeffrey Lord, writing for the American Spectator, points out the GOP establishment was wrong about the political impact of the 2013 government shutdown.\n\nThe whole event was giving prominent Republicans in and out of office the political willies. \u2026Republican senators, congressmen, governors, ex-office holders, potential presidential candidates, lobbyists and pundits\u2026were spreading the word. That word? \u2026it was some version of curtains for the GOP. The party would be toast. \u2026they all got it wrong. Not just wrong, but Big Time Wrong. A week ago the Republican Party \u2014 barely a year away from the government shut down these folks were bewailing in various terms as bad strategy that \u201cwill lose more\u201d for Republicans than Democrats \u2014 won a blowout election. \u2026Will Republicans learn anything here? \u2026Do you think Mitch McConnell makes the connection between the government shutdown of 2013 and the fact that he is about to become Senate Majority Leader?\n\nTo be fair, we don\u2019t know what would have happened if there wasn\u2019t a shutdown in 2013, so maybe the GOP still would have taken the Senate.\n\nBut there\u2019s also no doubt that the GOP benefited by having a big public fight about Obamacare. Voters didn\u2019t remember the shutdown, but they did remember that Republicans were against the President\u2019s government-run healthcare scheme and they remembered that Democrats were for it.\n\nI have no idea whether that made a difference in one Senate race of six Senate races, but Obamacare clearly was an albatross for Democrats.\n\nIn closing, I want to point out that there are limits to a shutdown strategy.\n\nPicking a fight (or, more accurately, refusing to surrender to Obama) in 2015 is almost surely a winning strategy. But having the same fight in October of 2016 probably wouldn\u2019t be very smart, particularly since the establishment press would do everything possible to spin the fight in ways that advance Hillary Clinton (or some other left-leaning presidential nominee).\n\nIn other words, context matters. Pick the right fight.\n\nBut the bottom line is that Republicans - assuming they don\u2019t intend to acquiesce on every single issue - must be prepared to let Obama veto spending bills and shut down the government.\n\nReturning to the American Spectator story, Ted Cruz may not be very popular with some of his colleagues, but I think he made an unassailable point about what happens if the GOP unilaterally disarms.\n\nCruz\u2026asked them for their alternative. Cruz paused, then said that the response he got was \u201cthe sound of crickets chirping.\u201d\n\nP.S. One reason why Republicans are skittish about shutdowns is that they think they last the 1995 fight with Bill Clinton. But if you lived through that battle (or if you look at contemporaneous news reports), it\u2019s clear the Republicans had the upper hand.\n\nP.P.S.
