As a political ideology it was born during the Spanish-American War of 1898, reached its height with the victory of the Cuban Revolution in 1959, and may now, through a singularly courageous move by President Obama, have begun its final decline.\n\nThe agreement to re-establish diplomatic relations between the United States and Cuba will face serious problems: the opposition of conservative American legislators, as well as a tortuous path toward civil and political liberties in Cuba(the recent detention of bloggers trying to expand the range of free speech in Cuba is a bad omen). But acclaim for the agreement is widespread in Latin America. By his historic announcement on Dec. 17, Obama has begun to dismantle one of the most deeply rooted ideological passions of the southern continent.\n\nAt its distant origins, anti-Americanism had a religious character: a defensive fear on the part of conservative groups and the Catholic Church directed against the penetration of Protestant belief and culture. For Mexico there was the added offense of the 1846-48 American war of territorial aggrandizement. Nevertheless, the Liberals who governed Mexico in the latter half of the 19th century retained an admiration for the United States. Their republican and democratic ideas were stronger than their nationalist sentiments. Something of the same nature was true among progressive elites throughout the continent.\n\nBut the war of 1898 united the countries of Hispanic America against the United States and basically reconciled them with Spain, from which they had \u2014 Cuba was one exception \u2014 won their independence. As a result of that war, Latin American liberals experienced something similar to many Marxists after the fall of the Berlin Wall. They felt like orphans, while various American writers and intellectuals (like Mark Twain and William James) recognized an irresolvable contradiction between the democratic values on which the United States was founded and the now explicit intentions (as Henry Cabot Lodge said in 1895) that \u201cfrom the Rio Grande to the Arctic Ocean there should be but one flag and one country.\u201d\n\nMany saw the independence of Cuba secured by the war as merely the conversion of a Spanish colony into an American possession. And it was then that the liberals of Latin America began to converge with Catholics, other conservative groups and socialists in forming a Latin American nationalism centered on militant opposition to the United States.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBetween 1898 and 1959, with some exceptions, the political, diplomatic and military balance sheet of the United States in Latin America was nothing short of disastrous. In 1913, the American ambassador Henry Lane Wilson plotted with Mexican conservatives to overthrow (and eventually murder) Francisco I. Madero, the first democratically elected president of Mexico, a grim episode that foreshadowed other abuses: landings of the Marines, occupation of territory, support for military coups, and the insistent presence of huge American corporations. In the United States, diplomacy to further the interests of major businesses was seen as normal; to Latin Americans it was an intolerable display of greed.\n\nThe region reacted with a surge of nationalism, which the conservative American presidents of the period between the world wars treated as a harbinger of communism. Franklin D. Roosevelt, with his Good Neighbor Policy, somewhat corrected the mistaken direction of his predecessors by accepting the Mexican nationalization of its oil resources. But in Cuba, the connections between politics and American business interests remained unbroken and in plain sight. (Indeed, during World War II, Pan-American cooperation with the United States seemed to have its most fertile moment \u2014 with the prominent exception of Argentina.)\n\nAt the beginning of the Cold War, many Latin American thinkers attributed much of the region\u2019s poverty and inequality to the presence of American interests and saw socialism, expressed in various Marxist varieties, as a legitimate alternative. The United States continued to support authoritarian dictatorships, like the Somoza family business in Nicaragua. America\u2019s claim to be a fount of democratic values lost its credibility.\n\nIn 1947, the liberal Mexican historian Daniel Cos\u00edo Villegas predicted: \u201cLatin America will seethe with unrest and ... they will be capable of anything, of sheltering and supporting the enemies of the United States and themselves becoming the most bitter of its possible enemies. And then there will be no way to subdue them, or even to frighten them.\u201d\n\nThe Cuban Revolution fulfilled this prophecy and opened a new cycle of intense anti-Americanism. Kennedy\u2019s Alliance for Progress and the conciliatory moves of Jimmy Carter could not counterbalance the bitterness provoked by Republican administrations. C.I.A. involvement in the coup against Salvador Allende in Chile or the crimes of the Reagan administration in the \u201cdirty wars\u201d of Central America incited generations of young Latin Americans to emulate Che Guevara and Fidel Castro. The ideological hatred of \u201cYankee imperialism\u201d became standard in many universities. The rage thus engendered was the most effective weapon of survival for the repressive and dictatorial Cuban regime.\n\nIn 1989 the Berlin Wall fell and, surprisingly, democratic governments came to power through the ballot box in various Latin American battlegrounds, notably Chile, Nicaragua and El Salvador. Marxists were orphaned by ideology, and space was opened for liberal and social-democratic governments.\n\nAnti-Americanism in the region will never disappear, but it is going out of fashion \u2014 and Obama\u2019s decision will certainly further its demise. It had been artificially maintained by the incendiary histrionics of Hugo Ch\u00e1vez in Venezuela. But it has become more difficult to mask the anachronism of Chavista discourse, directed against the \u201cempire\u201d that is the principal client for Venezuela\u2019s oil. Only the great obstacle of the American boycott of Cuba has remained as an outmoded and divisive force.\n\nIn re-establishing relations with Cuba, the United States renounces its \u201cimperial destiny\u201d and recovers much of the moral legitimacy needed to uphold the democratic values that led to its foundation (and also of the countries of Latin America). Obama\u2019s action is meant for the good of all the Americas, including the United States. And freedom of expression in Cuba is an absolute necessity for its success. No people or country is an island unto itself. The Castro dynasty has kept Cuba as such for 56 years.\n\nEnrique Krauze is a historian, the editor of the literary magazine Letras Libres and the author of \u201cRedeemers: Ideas and Power in Latin America.\u201d This article was translated by Hank Heifetz from the Spanish.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "opinion", "ptime": 20150107054418, "twitter": {"description": "Latin America\u2019s long and deep hatred of the United States may now fade with Obama\u2019s historic opening to Cuba.", "title": "End of Anti-Americanism?", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/08/opinion/enrique-krauze-end-of-anti-americanism.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003434555"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/10/04/opinion/Krauze-contributor/Krauze-contributor-thumbLarge-v2.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/08/opinion/enrique-krauze-end-of-anti-americanism.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003434555", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/08/opinion/enrique-krauze-end-of-anti-americanism.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "opinion", "hdl_p": "End of Anti-Americanism?", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "Jan. 7, 2015", "edt": "Global", "keywords": "Latin America,Cuba,Politics and Government,International Relations,Obama  Barack", "news_keywords": "Cuba", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Enrique Krauze", "thumbnail_150": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/10/04/opinion/Krauze-contributor/Krauze-contributor-thumbLarge-v2.jpg", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "per": "Obama, Barack", "thumbnail_150_width": 150, "byl": "By ENRIQUE KRAUZE", "thumbnail_150_height": 150, "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "Latin America\u2019s long and deep hatred of the United States may now fade with Obama\u2019s historic opening to Cuba.", "tom": "Op-Ed", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "CT": "column", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/10/04/opinion/Krauze-contributor/Krauze-contributor-thumbStandard-v2.jpg", "description": "Latin America\u2019s long and deep hatred of the United States may now fade with Obama\u2019s historic opening to Cuba.", "CN": "enrique-krauze", "CG": "opinion", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "Jan. 7, 2015", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "Op-Ed", "article": {"author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/k/enrique_krauze/index.html", "section_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/pages/opinion/index.html", "section": "Opinion", "modified": "2015-01-30", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "tag": "Obama, Barack", "published": "2015-01-07", "section-taxonomy-id": "AD8090D7-4137-4D71-84C8-70DA3BD89778"}, "thumbnail_height": 75, "geo": "Cuba", "slug": "08iht-edkrauze08", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20150130150304, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/08/opinion/enrique-krauze-end-of-anti-americanism.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/10/04/opinion/Krauze-contributor/Krauze-contributor-videoSixteenByNine600-v2.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Latin America\u2019s long and deep hatred of the United States may now fade with Obama\u2019s historic opening to Cuba.", "title": "End of Anti-Americanism?"}, "pdate": 20150107, "des": "International Relations", "nyt-collection": {"tone": "opinion", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/column/enrique-krauze", "tagline": "Mexican politics, culture and society.", "uri": "/column/enrique-krauze", "display-name": "Enrique Krauze", "identifier": "enrique-krauze", "type": "column"}, "articleid": 100000003434555, "cre": "International New York Times", "hdl": "End of Anti-Americanism?", "col": "Contributing Op-Ed Writer", "PST": "Op-Ed"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd4021\"", "article_summary": "MEXICO CITY \u2014 Cuba has been the epicenter of anti-Americanism in modern Latin America.\nAs a result of that war, Latin American liberals experienced something similar to many Marxists after the fall of the Berlin Wall.\nObama\u2019s action is meant for the good of all the Americas, including the United States.\nNevertheless, the Liberals who governed Mexico in the latter half of the 19th century retained an admiration for the United States.\nThe United States continued to support authoritarian dictatorships, like the Somoza family business in Nicaragua."}
