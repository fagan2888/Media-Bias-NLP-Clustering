One of the most famous lines in Avalanche history, when Patrick Roy said “I can’t really hear what Jeremy says, because I got my two Stanley Cup rings plugged in my ears” to Jeremy Roenick of Chicago in the 1996 Western Conference semifinals, got an addition Thursday.

Roenick was at the Avs practice facility this morning, doing a segment on Matt Duchene for NBC. We asked Roy, who got two more rings after that series, if he could hear anything Roenick said to him during the visit.

“I had the other two rings in my mouth, I couldn’t say anything to him,” Roy said.

We all cracked up in the media room, of course. And, of course, Roy meant it in good nature to Roenick.

Here’s the old video of Roy saying that in 1996, which came after Roenick responded to Roy, saying he would not have scored on him on a breakaway even if he hadn’t been hooked by Sandis Ozolinsh, by saying he wondered where Roy was on two previous breakaway goals by him, that he was “probably getting his jock out of the stands, out of the rafters, of the United Center.”
