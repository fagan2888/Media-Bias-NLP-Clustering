According to NBC News, the chase began after a local officer tried to arrest Leija on an outstanding warrant at a fast food restaurant. During the 18-minute-long chase, Leija twice called police dispatch to warn he was armed and willing to shoot if the chase wasn\u2019t called off.\n\nPolice laid spike strips at three spots along the highway in an attempt to disable Leija\u2019s car. Despite orders from a superior to stand by until Leija reached the spike strips, State Trooper Chadrin Mullenix fired 6 shots from an overpass at the speeding car. At least 4 of these shots fatally hit Leija; none hit the car\u2019s engine block.\n\n\u201c[I]t was clearly established under the Fourth Amendment,\u201d Sotomayor wrote in her dissent, \u201cthat an officer in Mullenix\u2019s position should not have fired the shots.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "In a powerful dissent this morning, Justice Sotomayor had some extremely critical words for her colleagues", "author": "Brendan Gauthier", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "In a powerful dissent this morning, Justice Sotomayor had some extremely critical words for her colleagues", "title": "Sotomayor shreds conservative SCOTUS justices for justifying \u201cdeadly force for no discernible gain\u201d", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/11/09/sotomayor_shreds_conservative_scotus_justices_for_justifying_deadly_force_for_no_discernible_gain/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2009/05/smearing_sotomayor.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "In a powerful dissent this morning, Justice Sotomayor had some extremely critical words for her colleagues", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2009/05/smearing_sotomayor.jpg", "title": "Sotomayor shreds conservative SCOTUS justices for justifying \u201cdeadly force for no discernible gain\u201d", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Sotomayor shreds conservative SCOTUS justices for justifying \u201cdeadly force for no discernible gain\u201d", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, police abuse, police violence, SCOTUS, Sonia Sotomayor, Supreme Court", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Police laid spike strips at three spots along the highway in an attempt to disable Leija\u2019s car.\nDuring the 18-minute-long chase, Leija twice called police dispatch to warn he was armed and willing to shoot if the chase wasn\u2019t called off.\n\u201c[I]t was clearly established under the Fourth Amendment,\u201d Sotomayor wrote in her dissent, \u201cthat an officer in Mullenix\u2019s position should not have fired the shots.\u201d\nDespite orders from a superior to stand by until Leija reached the spike strips, State Trooper Chadrin Mullenix fired 6 shots from an overpass at the speeding car.\nAccording to NBC News, the chase began after a local officer tried to arrest Leija on an outstanding warrant at a fast food restaurant."}
