The U.S. Senate on Friday struggled to pass a $1.1 trillion spending bill that would avert a looming federal government shutdown, postponing a vote until Monday when procedural hurdles begin to evaporate. REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst (UNITED STATES - Tags: POLITICS BUSINESS) - RTR4HWEL\n\n4416280\n\nFollowing the Republican base\u2019s charge that their leaders betrayed them by working with the White House and Democrats to prevent an embarrassing vote to defund President Obama\u2019s executive amnesty on a must pass spending bill, Utah Senator and conservative rock star, Mike Lee said, \u201cThe American people are frustrated, understandably, with their government. And, I share that frustration.\u201d\n\nLee says in this exclusive video interview with The Daily Caller, \u201cIt\u2019s morning in America. We may not realize it, or better said, Washington, D.C, may be the last place to realize it, but it\u2019s happening.\u201d\n\nTalking about the demoralizing Lame Duck performance of Congress, Lee says, \u201cMy message is it\u2019s time for the American people to expect more.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t settle,\u201d he says. \u201cExpect Congress to vigorously defend its institutional authority and the constitutional rights of the American people.\u201d\n\nSince his arrival in 2010, Senator Lee has proven himself to be bold, positive and principled, while steeped in a thorough understanding of America\u2019s founding and the U.S. Constitution. In January, he will be honored as the new chairman of the Senate Steering Committee.\n\nBut it is clear he has now gotten too effective for the old bulls and special interests.\n\nAlthough a new poll shows Lee\u2019s popularity among Utah Republicans at 76%, higher than fellow Utah Senator Orrin Hatch\u2019s, Lee is under attack for shaking up the way Washington works and exposing other Republicans as beholden to special interests. Threats are being leveled of running a business-friendly primary opponent against him this cycle, while \u201chit pieces\u201d are being penned.\n\nAsked about the 56 men who signed the Declaration of Independence at considerable personal risk and where the fight is for self-government, Lee reminded us: \u201cThe fight, in many respects is analogous to what it was at the time of the [American] Revolution.\u201d\n\nThen, \u201cwe didn\u2019t have everybody, not even a majority\u2026 Right now we don\u2019t have a majority, but I think we are getting to the point where we will have enough. We have to have enough.\u201d\n\nOn President Obama avoiding Congress to make laws unilaterally, Lee says \u201cthis has changed the way we make laws.\u201d Congress, a voice for citizens, is allowing itself to become irrelevant.\n\nFor the midterm elections, Lee traveled to states where bruising primaries resulted in demoralized conservative voters feeling left out. He made the pitch for unity in order to fight the progressive transformation of America, but now he, and other bold conservatives, are feeling pressure from their own feckless leaders. Republican leaders, in search of a new base, appear to be abandoning conservativism while Democrats are increasingly dominated by the hard left.\n\nAsked about the newly exposed architect of Obamacare, Jonathan Gruber, Lee says his words expose how Obamacare was \u201cfraudulently conceived, put forward on an unwilling, unwitting public,\u201d and \u201cmoved through a Congress which, although overwhelmingly controlled by the president\u2019s party, was not really aware of what it was processing.\u201d\n\nLee says Obamacare and Gruber also \u201creflect something else deeply troubling about the way Washington works. Sometimes those who are pitching legislation that they want to pass will deliberately conceal the facts about that legislation as long as they can.\u201d\n\nReminded of the 2013 government shutdown he was instrumental in encouraging, Lee sees that early battle as an important marker for Congress relinquishing its constitutional \u201cpower of the purse\u201d against an unpopular, harmful law pushed by a stubborn, out-of-control president. \u201cFor partisan political reasons,\u201d he says, President Obama shut down the government \u201cinstead of compromising, negotiating and abiding by the Constitution.\u201d\n\nLee has a bold agenda for Republican governance. Soon enough, we will watch if his own party leaders embrace conservative policies that promise results, or choose instead to cooperate with President Obama\u2019s fundamental transformation of America.\n\nMrs. Thomas does not necessarily support or endorse the products, services or positions promoted in any advertisement contained herein, and does not have control over or receive compensation from any advertiser.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Ginni Thomas", "description": "Sen.
