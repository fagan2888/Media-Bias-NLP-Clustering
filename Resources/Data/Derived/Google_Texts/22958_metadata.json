According to a poll taken by the non-profit Kaiser Family Foundation last month, more than 75% of Americans who do not have health insurance and, thus, are required by law to get it, are unaware of the deadline. What's more, half don\u2019t understand how they or their family will be affected, and nearly two-thirds admit they know little or nothing about the health-care marketplaces where they can get information and apply for coverage.\n\nFor an interactive look at what various types of individuals think of the ACA, click here.\n\n\u201cPeople are procrastinating,\u201d says John DeVito, president of Flexible Benefits, an Illinois-based insurance broker that also runs a health insurance exchange. His concern is that if you wait until the last minute to begin to investigate your options or to sign up, something could go wrong and you will miss the deadline. \u201cThey don\u2019t understand that you cannot buy an individual policy starting April 1.\u201d\n\nIn other words, if you don't sign up in March, you lose the opportunity to do so until the next enrollment period opens later this year. However, even if you enroll then, you coverage will not begin until Jan. 1, 2015.\n\nYou are toast. Hosed. Outa luck.\n\nContinue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT\n\nYour only hope is that a) you and/or your family members don\u2019t get sick or have an accident over the next nine months, or b) you have a \u201cqualifying event\u201d (have a baby, get divorced, laid off, you change jobs and lose coverage), then you become eligible to buy an ACA-approved policy even if it\u2019s after the end of this month.\n\nOf course, you could opt for a short-term policy to tide you over, but these are expensive. And you\u2019d have to pay the full amount for nine months of coverage up front instead of making a much smaller payment each month.\n\nThe only way you can be assured of coverage is if you sign up with an ACA-approved insurance firm no later than midnight March 31.\n\nMaybe you plan to roll the dice and take your chances. You figure, \u201cI\u2019m young, single, healthy. I hardly ever get sick. Why spend the money? How are they going to find out?\u201d\n\nWell, there's a penalty if you remain uninsured. \u201cYou have to provide proof of purchase when you file your tax return,\u201d says DeVito. And don\u2019t try to fake it, the insurance companies are registered with the federal government.\n\nIn case you think it\u2019s is a mere slap on the wrist, consider this: The penalty is either $95 or 1% of your gross pay. Whichever amount is greater. So, if you earn $50,000 per year, your penalty is $500. But don\u2019t worry, the government makes it convenient to pay the fine. \u201cThey take it right out of your tax refund,\u201d says DeVito. (If you don\u2019t qualify for a refund, they just add the penalty to your tax bill.)\n\nPerhaps your income is so low you don\u2019t have to file a tax return. No problem, in that case you probably qualify for Medicaid, which means you have health insurance and you don\u2019t have to purchase an ACA plan. Veterans are also covered by the VA.\n\nThe Young and the Reckless\n\nDeVito is especially concerned about young adults who he says \u201care just not buying\u201d the insurance. Yes, the launch of the ACA insurance exchanges was a mess and there are still glitches in the sign-up process, but this will not get you out of owing the penalty. \u201cPeople are so discouraged they\u2019re not even trying\u201d to find out about what\u2019s available, he says.\n\nFor people who can't afford to buy a plan, there are government subsidies that can help pay the premium. If you are eligible for a credit to help defray the cost of coverage, you don\u2019t have to wait until your file your taxes next year in order to receive it. There\u2019s an option that allows you to \u201cget it now\u201d and have all or part of the money paid directly to the insurance provider you choose. You can find a subsidy calculator here.\n\nDeVito recommends that at the very least, those who are young and relatively healthy consider a high-deductible plan. This type of plan is less expensive because the insurance company isn\u2019t on the hook for paying benefits until your medical bills exceed a certain amount, such as $5,000. The point, he says, is that it \u201cprotects you from financial catastrophe.\u201d If you get a job that offers health insurance, you can drop your ACA plan.\n\nGiven the cost of health care today, it\u2019s easier than you might think for bills to mount up. DeVito tells the story of one of his own employees whose 19-year old son was involved in a serious car accident. His medical bills after nine surgeries exceeded $1.5 million. Fortunately, because he was under age 26, he was covered under his father\u2019s insurance plan. If you\u2019re older than that, you are on your own.\n\nBuying insurance under the ACA is just the opposite of how insurance typically works, says DeVito. \u201cYou can always cancel your coverage, but you can\u2019t always buy it. Miss the March 31 cutoff and \u201cIt\u2019s as if you went to a store for an operation and there\u2019s a sign that says \u2018Closed Until Next Year.\u2019\u201d\n\n1.
