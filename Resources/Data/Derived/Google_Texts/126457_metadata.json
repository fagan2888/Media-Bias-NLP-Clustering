Gaines, founder of Lovability Condoms, is right. The marketing, package design, and selling of condoms all spell \"man,\" not \"woman.\" So not only do women mistakenly presume guys will provide them, but women also tend to associate condoms with promiscuity.\n\nMeanwhile, it would benefit everyone\u2019s health if women assumed responsibility for them, since condoms do a pretty good (if imperfect) job of preventing most STDs. Prominently displayed on the company\u2019s crowdsourcing page is this tantalizing tidbit of data: \u201cA psychological research study conducted at UCLA proved that if more women carried condoms, more couples would use them.\u201d\n\nAnd so Gaines has decided to revolutionize the condom industry by making female-friendly condoms, which are vegan and also sustainably produced and sourced from, not just any, but a Fair Labor rubber plantation in Malaysia. (Natch.) Made of 100 percent natural premium latex, the marketing copy also states the new condoms are free of harsh chemicals or additives. Manufactured onsite, they are \u201cas fresh as possible,\u201d and unlike the status quo manly condoms available at drug stores, they don\u2019t have an \u201cirritating odor due to the fact that their rubber ferments while en route to their overseas manufacturing facility.\u201d\n\nBest of all, Gaines intends them to be carried by beauty supply stores, lingerie shops, and accessory boutiques \u2014 in other words, stores with a capital \"P\" for pink.
