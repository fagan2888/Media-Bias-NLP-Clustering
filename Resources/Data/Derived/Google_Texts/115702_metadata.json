Moreover, he goes out of his way to condemn communism, and not just the foreign left-wing dictators (That was easy then. Today\u2019s leftists brag about vacations in the Castros\u2019 Cuba.) Beyond that, this president condemned the infiltrators on our own soil. (Today, it would be called a \u201cwitch hunt.\u201d)\n\nAmerica, meet the real John F. Kennedy, as viewed by Ira Stoll, revisionist fact-checker. In \u201cJFK, Conservative,\u201d this author and journalist acknowledges the liberal \u201creforms\u201d the 35th president promised the nation, including education and medical care for the elderly (pre-Medicare, and surely predating today\u2019s wobbling Obamacare).\n\nHowever, wearing his historian\u2019s hat, Mr. Stoll did not sit down to write about what President Kennedy promised. Politicians make lofty promises all the time. Lincoln, for one, made public pronouncements in his time that would amaze many of today\u2019s idolaters of the Civil War president\u2019s legacy.\n\nNo, this author\u2019s focus is on what Kennedy actually did or tried to do while in the White House. Whether the president would have changed course had his life not been cut short by Lee Harvey Oswald\u2019s bullet is unknown. That question mark has encouraged many partisans on the left to place JFK post-mortem in their camp. However, the author cites facts that consistently get in the way of the image.\n\nFor one thing, Kennedy\u2019s fierce anti-communism as revealed in \u201cJFK, Conservative\u201d belies the image touted by today\u2019s liberals who claim his mantle. The president, for example, had warned civil rights icon Martin Luther King Jr. that two of his associates were communists. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to get rid of them,\u201d he warned.\n\nSupposedly, the Kennedy-Nixon presidential race in 1960 was the ultimate ideological showdown, with Nixon the traditional conservative versus Kennedy the liberal. Clear cut, right? Au contraire.\n\nThe pattern, Mr. Stoll points out, \u201cin all four debates was that Nixon sounded like a tax-and-spend peacenik, and Kennedy sounded like a hard-liner against both federal spending and communism.\u201d\n\nReligion crept into the campaign, not because Kennedy would be the first Catholic president of the United States (far less contentious than in Al Smith\u2019s time 32 years earlier), but because the candidate repeatedly linked the role of religion to the founding of America.\n\nNote this from the Democratic candidate: \u201cA society which seeks to make the worship of the state the ultimate objective of life cannot permit a higher loyalty, a faith in God, a belief in a religion that elevates the individual and acknowledges his true value .\u201d Those who utter such sentiments in the current era are likely derided as \u201cextremists\u201d of the \u201creligious right.\u201d\n\nOn foreign-policy concerns, Rep. (and then Sen.) Kennedy faulted President Truman and his State Department \u201cand their academic advisers for the loss of much of mainland China to the communists.\u201d He went on to blame such targets of the congressional anti-communist investigators as Harvard\u2019s John K. Fairbank and Johns Hopkins\u2019 Owen Lattimore.\n\nMoreover, Kennedy\u2019s settled aversion to communists was on display into his short presidency, including the failed Bay of Pigs operation, an attempt to rid communism from its perch in Cuba 90 miles from U.S. shores, and later, of course, his successful resistance to Soviet missiles delivered to Castro\u2019s island prison state and pointed toward the United States.\n\nBased on the above, it would be easy to describe JFK not as a \u201cconservative\u201d as Mr. Stoll claims, but as an anti-communist liberal. However, wait. He was a tax-cutter, too.\n\nWhereas in the debates, as Nixon contemplated having to raise taxes, Kennedy repeatedly said the very idea of implementing tax hikes was the exact opposite of generating \u201cgrowth.\u201d\n\nWhen he became president, he followed through. His program aimed at steep cuts in personal- and income-tax rates, as well as corporate and capital-gains tax rates.\n\nKennedy wanted to lower them all, writes Mr. Stoll. He made the same argument Reagan would make in 1980, but (ironically) with precisely the opposite partisan reaction: Many Republicans (and some Democrats) thought Kennedy\u2019s plan was reckless, but centrist Democrats and a few farsighted Republicans agreed with their president.\n\nThe tax cuts\u2019 journey toward enactment was finally authorized by Kennedy following a debate within his administration. When the measure became law after the assassination, the nation embarked on a path toward a robust economy lasting for years.\n\nSome things about his White House tenure did not please conservatives. They are for another day. Overall, Kennedy comes off as far more conservative than liberal.\n\nWhy then does the myth of JFK the \u201cliberal\u201d persist? The author cites the media and biased historians, as well as friends of the president who are partial to \u201chistory\u201d as they wish it had been.\n\nWes Vernon is a writer and broadcast journalist whose career ended with 25 years at CBS Radio.
