Josh Barro to join The New York Times

Josh Barro, the outgoing Business Insider political editor, is joining The New York Times to take part in David Leonhardt's new policy venture, sources familiar with his plans told POLITICO on Monday.

Barro, a former Bloomberg View blogger who writes frequently about economic policy, joined Business Insider in May 2013 and has since become a fixture on MSNBC's daytime programming. He announced his departure from BI on Monday but declined to share details about his next move.

Leonhardt, the former Washington bureau chief at the Times, has been tasked with spearheading a new policy vertical in the wake of Nate Silver's departure to ESPN. He has described the vertical as an effort to "demystify politics, economics, health care and other issues." Laura Chang, the former Times Science editor, and Damon Darlin, the former Times Technology editor, have been tapped to assist with the project.

Leonhardt's project is one of many burgeoning analytical projects in media today. Both Silver and Ezra Klein, the former Washington Post blogger, are building their own sites while the Times, The Washington Post and The Wall Street Journal have all announced plans to embark on new data-driven ventures.

Barro declined to comment on his next move on Monday, saying only that he was "leaving to take an exciting opportunity that will be announced in the next few days." Leonhardt did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
