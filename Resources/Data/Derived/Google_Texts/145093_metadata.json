Those students pay a reduced rate with UGA covering the remainder of the costs.\n\nWhat UGA does will make a big difference for many graduate students, said Audrey Lewis, president of the UGA Graduate Student Association.\n\nEven before the Affordable Health Care Act issue arose, \u201cHealth insurance is probably the No. 1 concern of graduate students,\u201d she said.\n\nUnlike many undergraduates, graduate students can\u2019t rely on coverage from their parents; many are parents themselves, said Lewis, a master\u2019s degree student in UGA\u2019s School of Public and International Affairs.\n\n\u201cWe have families, people returning to education after being in the workforce,\u201d she said. \u201cGraduate students are already kind of in a financial bind. To just take that away \u2014 suddenly you\u2019re responsible for much more money, and it\u2019s mandatory.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, higher education groups that represent colleges or graduate students are trying to persuade the IRS and the federal Department of Health and Human Services to change their interpretations of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe rule in question prohibits business from giving employees subsidies to buy individual health insurance, which would allow them to circumvent requirements that businesses of a certain size provide employer health insurance.\n\nBut the IRS classifies graduate students on assistantships as employees, because they work for their money, and Health and Human Services classifies student health insurance plans the same as individual private market plans.\n\nA lot of schools are taking UGA\u2019s approach, said Kristofferson Culmer, president and CEO of the National Association of Graduate-Professional Students.\n\n\u201cIt seems like a lot of universities are sitting back and waiting to see what the IRS will do,\u201d he said.\n\nCulmer hopes universities can find some creative ways to help graduate students at the local level, and that federal authorities can be persuaded that being a graduate student isn\u2019t exactly the same thing as being a part-time worker, or that university health plans aren\u2019t the same as individual plans.\n\n\u201cWe think there should be an exception or exemption for universities,\u201d he said.\n\nFollow education reporter Lee Shearer at www.facebook.com/LeeShearerABH or https://twitter.com/LeeShearer.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Athens News, Athens Georgia, Athens Banner Herald, Athens, Georgia, Georgia Bulldogs, Dawgs, Bulldogs, Music, UGA, newspaper, 30601, Clarke County, Madison, Oconee, Oglethorpe, Dogs, 30602, 30603, 30604, 30605, Richt, SEC football, Jackson County, R.E.M., Widespread Panic, B-52s, Mobile, Local News, Lee Shearer", "og": {"site_name": "Online Athens", "description": "University of Georgia graduate students are waiting to see whether the university will continue to help them pay for health insurance that is mandatory for many graduate students.", "title": "UGA grad students wait to see if they'll lose health insurance subsidy", "url": "http://onlineathens.com/mobile/2015-08-23/uga-grad-students-wait-see-if-theyll-lose-health-insurance-subsidy", "image": "http://onlineathens.com/sites/default/files/14650532.jpg", "type": "article"}, "description": "OnlineAthens.com is the daily online edition of The Athens (GA) Banner-Herald."}, "article_summary": "The rule in question prohibits business from giving employees subsidies to buy individual health insurance, which would allow them to circumvent requirements that businesses of a certain size provide employer health insurance.\nWhat UGA does will make a big difference for many graduate students, said Audrey Lewis, president of the UGA Graduate Student Association.\nEven before the Affordable Health Care Act issue arose, \u201cHealth insurance is probably the No.\nUniversity of Georgia graduate students are waiting to see whether the university will continue to help them pay for health insurance that is mandatory for many graduate students.\nBut the IRS classifies graduate students on assistantships as employees, because they work for their money, and Health and Human Services classifies student health insurance plans the same as individual private market plans."}
