Will this be the one that breaks the bank?\n\nTime to check your tickets to see if the lengthy losing streak stretches longer or finally snaps. Here are the winning Powerball numbers drawn at 11 p.m. on Saturday, Sept. 14: 1-17-25-37-44, and the Powerball selected was 20.\n\nHeading into tonight's drawing, the jackpot was estimated at $317 million and the projected cash option value was $176.3 million.\n\nDuring the last drawing, Wednesday night, no tickets matched all the winning numbers (11-19-33-42-52, with the Powerball 33).\n\nThe last huge jackpot that was claimed was the $448.4 million Powerball drawing back on Aug. 7, which generated three winning tickets \u2014 two of which were sold in New Jersey. The so-called Ocean's 16, a group of 16 employees at the Ocean County maintenance garage, and Mario Scarnici of South Brunswick shared the Aug. 7 prize with Paul White of Minnesota.\n\nIt was the fourth largest jackpot in U.S. lottery history.\n\nSince then, there have been two $1 million tickets sold in the state \u2014 one in Bloomfield for the Aug. 31 Powerball drawing and one in Passaic for the Sept. 6 Mega Millions drawing.\n\nARE YOU A WINNER?\n\nEven if you didn't match all six winning numbers tonight, don't toss your tickets yet.
