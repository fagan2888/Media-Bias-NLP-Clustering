Rat-a-tat texting! The shaming \u201cshhhhh!\u201d\n\nYears of mounting tension over audience behavior hit a dramatic climax this month, when a teenager clambered onto a stage to try to recharge his phone and veteran star Patti LuPone whisked a phone away from a texting spectator, hours after performing a matinee punctuated by incoming calls. LuPone says she\u2019s even considering quitting stage work because of the electronic onslaught.\n\nAs Broadway faces off against pocket-sized sound-and-light shows, performers and some patrons say smartphones and a hyper-connected culture are shredding the immersive experience of live theater.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve just spent pretty close to a day\u2019s salary on theater tickets \u2014 I don\u2019t want to be distracted by people turning on their phone to check the time or text,\u201d Broadway fan Robin Satty of Piscataway, New Jersey, said this past week as she went to see the best-play Tony-winner \u201cThe Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time.\u201d\n\nStill, some theater-world insiders say it\u2019s time to educate, rather than scold, a growing audience that\u2019s used to interactivity and may not be steeped in theater etiquette. Some even are experimenting with embracing patrons\u2019 digital habits, to a point.\n\n\u201cWe have to be very careful that we let people know what\u2019s appropriate without pushing them away,\u201d said Broadway producer Ken Davenport, who allowed some \u201ctweet seats\u201d in back rows during a performance of \u201cGodspell\u201d a few years ago.\n\nDistractions in Broadway\u2019s storied houses are as old as candy wrappers and coughs, and habitues have complained about declining audience decorum since T-shirts started rubbing elbows with sport coats. But smartphones have proven especially nettlesome, with their combination of sounds, cameras and glowing screens that create their own Great White Way.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re onstage, you notice every single person who\u2019s texting,\u201d said actor Will Swenson, whose Broadway credits include starring roles in \u201cLes Miserables\u201d and \u201cHair.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe second that a light pops on in the audience, it\u2019s impossible to not say, \u2018Oh, yeah, I\u2019m in a theater, and someone is out there not paying attention to my best efforts to tell a story,'\u201d said Swenson, who recalls grabbing a video-shooting patron\u2019s phone during \u201cHair.\u201d\n\nOther stars, from Matthew Broderick to Frances McDormand, have briefly stopped shows in response to spectators talking on phones and shooting video. But usually, actors just forge ahead.\n\nNew York City largely outlawed cellphone use in theater audiences in 2003, but officials couldn\u2019t immediately say whether anyone has been fined. Theaters routinely advise patrons of prohibitions on taking photos or videos and try various tactics to urge them to silence phones. (Actually blocking cell phone signals is illegal for consumer purposes .)", "article_metadata": {"description": "Ain\u2019t misbehavin\u2019?
