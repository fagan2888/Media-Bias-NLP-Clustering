A dozen states operated their own websites this year.\n\nconsidering the number of flaws in the three states they examined As a result of its findings, the GAO recommended continuous federal cybersecurity monitoring for the state exchange websites.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nThe GAO initially released a public report that left the studied states anonymous, but identified them following a Freedom of Information request from the Associated Press. The information still does not identify which issues are specific to which states.\n\nThe issues included a lack of password encryption, lack of encryption on site servers, and lack of proper filtering to block hostile site visits.\n\nThe states said the security holes have not resulted in any security breaches so far and that solutions are being implemented.\n\nKentucky's exchange is slated to be dismantled later this year as the state switches back to the federal exchange.\n\nVermont reported it has switched vendors since the review to ensure correct controls are in place.\n\nCalifornia did not disclose how it is addressing its exchange flaws to protect its security, officials said.\n\nOf course, security on HealthCare.gov has issues as well.\n\nThe GAO reported the federal exchange experienced 316 security incidents between October 2013 and March 2015, including unauthorized access, data disclosure and violations of security practices. While officials say no data were lost or stolen, the GAO noted HealthCare.gov's weaknesses \"continue to jeopardize the confidentiality, integrity and availability\" of the site.\n\nRecommended Reading\n\nThe New York Times: Security Flaws Found in 3 State Health Insurance Websites\n\nThe Hill: Watchdog: Security flaws plague state ObamaCare exchanges", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Heather Caspi", "twitter": {"domain": "Healthcare Dive", "site": "@healthcaredive", "card": "summary"}, "featured": "False", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://www.healthcaredive.com/user_media/cache/44/29/4429df44d6729190e0b988db61ab6f72.jpg", "sailthru.tags": "healthcare,type-newspost,healthcare-health-it,healthcare-payer", "news_keywords": "Health IT,Payer", "category": "News Post", "title": "GAO report highlights ACA state exchange security flaws", "pub_date": "apr 11, 2016", "section": "news", "sailthru.date": "2016-04-11T12:13:45", "content_boost": 4, "touched": "True", "article_date_original": "Monday, April 11, 2016, 12:13 PM", "medium": "news", "description": "Healthcare", "sailthru.expire_date": "2026-03-30T12:13:45", "teaser": "<p>Hundreds of thousands of users&#39; data were&nbsp;vulnerable to hackers in&nbsp;California, Kentucky and Vermont&#39;s&nbsp;exchange websites.</p>", "sponsored": "False", "date": "2016-04-11", "sailthru.description": "Hundreds of thousands of users' data were\u00a0vulnerable to hackers in\u00a0California, Kentucky and Vermont's\u00a0exchange websites.", "viewport": "width=986", "og": {"site_name": "Healthcare Dive", "description": "Hundreds of thousands of users' data were\u00a0vulnerable to hackers in\u00a0California, Kentucky and Vermont's\u00a0exchange websites.", "title": "GAO report highlights ACA state exchange security flaws", "url": "http://www.healthcaredive.com/news/gao-report-highlights-aca-state-exchange-security-flaws-1/417132/", "image": "http://www.healthcaredive.com/user_media/diveimage/Depositphotos_17457397_original.jpg", "type": "article"}, "google-site-verification": "aN-77CvDv8Rt4OQnHMaUSm6V87TF8ri5GDUv93p7pHk", "sailthru.image.full": "http://www.healthcaredive.com/user_media/cache/fd/1e/fd1ec8fae86be9848ca5d9a7635cb92d.jpg"}, "article_summary": "Recommended ReadingThe New York Times: Security Flaws Found in 3 State Health Insurance WebsitesThe Hill: Watchdog: Security flaws plague state ObamaCare exchanges\nCalifornia did not disclose how it is addressing its exchange flaws to protect its security, officials said.\nconsidering the number of flaws in the three states they examined As a result of its findings, the GAO recommended continuous federal cybersecurity monitoring for the state exchange websites.\nKentucky's exchange is slated to be dismantled later this year as the state switches back to the federal exchange.\nThe GAO reported the federal exchange experienced 316 security incidents between October 2013 and March 2015, including unauthorized access, data disclosure and violations of security practices."}
