Start by creating a file called \u201c2015 Taxes\u201d and drop last year\u2019s return in it. Then be on the lookout for all of the tax documents that come rolling in: 1099s and W-2s are due to you Feb. 1, while banks, investment and mutual fund companies, and lenders will all send tax documents by mid-February. (Many forms are available online earlier.)\n\nNext up: Gather your credit card summaries, check emailed receipts, and review checking accounts for possible deductions, such as charitable donations and job search costs. Use last year\u2019s return as a guide to what\u2019s missing.\n\nIf this is the first time that you are hiring a tax preparer, it\u2019s best to contact to contact him or her immediately to set up an appointment. Otherwise, you may get shut out.\n\nThe IRS provides taxpayers whose incomes are $62,000 or less with free tax prep software (called \u201cFree File\u201d and available through IRS.gov). Electronic filing is available to all taxpayers, however \u2014 regardless of income \u2014 and the IRS2Go mobile app and Where\u2019s My Refund? tools let you track refunds within 24 hours after the IRS has received an e-filed return, or within four weeks after you have mailed a paper return.\n\nIf you are filing a paper return, check out Where To File for a list of IRS addresses.\n\nFraud Worries\n\nOne good incentive to get your act together promptly this tax season: fraud prevention. Last year the IRS acknowledged that criminals had accessed IRS.gov to steal information on nearly 400,000 taxpayers. States are also on high alert after the filing of fraudulent returns, which prompted TurboTax to halt e-filings well before Tax Day last year.\n\nWhile the IRS has announced several measures the agency says will prevent tax fraud, filing early is one good way to prevent others from trying to file a return in your name.\n\nOne other anti-fraud tip to remember: The IRS never initiates contact with taxpayers about their accounts through e-mail, text messages, or other social media \u2014 so if you get an unsolicited email claiming to come from the IRS, avoid opening attachments or clicking on links, and forward it to the IRS.\n\nAudit Rates\n\nFor those who are fearful of an audit, preliminary data from the IRS showed that audits of individual taxpayers fell to their lowest rate in 11 years. Less than 1% of individual taxpayers \u2014 just over 1.2 million individuals \u2014 were audited in the 2015 fiscal year, the lowest share since 2004.\n\nThe main reason that audits are down is that the IRS budget has been slashed by 10% from its peak in 2010; the agency now has 22% fewer revenue agents (the folks who perform the audits) than it had five years ago.\n\nYet the highest earners are more likely to be audited than everyone else. Top audit red flags include: Not reporting income, a large change in income, being self-employed, and taking higher-than-average deductions.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Here's how to get started with tax prep, plus a few key deadlines, tax fraud prevention tips and audit red flags.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "MONEY.com", "description": "First, grab last year's return.", "title": "What You Need to Do Now to Prep for Tax Season", "url": "http://time.com/money/4197921/tax-season-tips-2016/", "image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/screen-shot-2016-01-27-at-5-20-07-pm.png?w=1012", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "MONEY", "image": {"src": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/screen-shot-2016-01-27-at-5-20-07-pm.png?w=1012"}, "description": "First, grab last year's return.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "What You Need to Do Now to Prep for Tax Season"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-tooltip": "Current & Breaking News | National & World Updates", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://time.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/2cee445ea71a179ffd35ea91cf154905?s=16", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "fb": {"app_id": 53177223193}, "p": {"domain_verify": "f48a8936c3fffc943fce516f2e3ff1d2"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/time2014/img/time-touch_icon_152.png", "application-name": "TIME", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/MoneyMagazine"}, "keywords": ", tax", "google-site-verification": "nFxFQf8F4Xgg0b9Ap9rOUJzg7MY74LicbBIzsLo8yIg", "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "tax season, tax tips, tax prep, tax deadlines, IRS fraud, tax fraud, audit red flags"}, "article_summary": "The IRS provides taxpayers whose incomes are $62,000 or less with free tax prep software (called \u201cFree File\u201d and available through IRS.gov).\nFraud WorriesOne good incentive to get your act together promptly this tax season: fraud prevention.\nIf this is the first time that you are hiring a tax preparer, it\u2019s best to contact to contact him or her immediately to set up an appointment.\nElectronic filing is available to all taxpayers, however \u2014 regardless of income \u2014 and the IRS2Go mobile app and Where\u2019s My Refund?\nStates are also on high alert after the filing of fraudulent returns, which prompted TurboTax to halt e-filings well before Tax Day last year."}
