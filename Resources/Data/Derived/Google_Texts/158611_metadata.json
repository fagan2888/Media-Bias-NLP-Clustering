Further, the interview with Luke Vernon, founder of Luke's Circle, shed light on the complexities and hard work necessary to find a job in today's competitive job market.\n\nBoth articles emphasized networking as an important part of a successful job search. Having referrals, introductions, contacts, and recommendations is critical in a successful job search; this is true electronically using LinkedIn.com and personally through active interaction with and purposeful development of one's network.\n\nUnfortunately both articles omitted reference to an important Boulder resource for job seekers. BoulderNet, http://www.meetup.com/BoulderNet-Meetup/, is a local group of people in career transition that meets twice a month to offer resources, support, encouragement, and contacts to those actively networking as part of their job search. BoulderNet has a philosophy of getting help for your job search and giving help to others in their job search. Meetings are the first and third Thursday mornings of each month. Meetings include sharing resources and networking among attendees, and usually a facilitated workshop related to job seeking. There is neither formal membership nor dues, only an invitation to come as you see value.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMembers \"pass through\" as they get new jobs.\n\nHaving retired as the director of Career Services at CU Boulder, I currently offer career counseling and job search coaching at the YWCA of Boulder County. http://www.ywcaboulder.org/programs/career/, another job seeker resource omitted in the articles. Through this job, I help those in career transition, and have the honor of facilitating the BoulderNet meetings.\n\nI'll add my voice to the encouragement of actively networking in a job search. Also I invite Boulderites to attend BoulderNet.\n\nGordon Gray\n\nYWCA Career Counselor\n\nBoulder", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/letters/ci_27991175/gordon-gray-how-find-job", "modificationDate": "2015-04-26T14:17:56-0600", "sailthru.section": "Opinion: Letters to the editor", "endDate": "2016-04-25T19:22:10-0600", "description": "The Business Plus article (\"The job of job hunting,\" Daily Camera, April 20) did the public a favor by focusing on the difficulty in job hunting.", "ag": {"canon": "BoulderDailyCamera:article:27991175:view"}, "startDate": "2015-04-26T19:22:10-0600", "og": {"url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/letters/ci_27991175/gordon-gray-how-find-job", "image": "http://extras.dailycamera.com/images/dailycamera3.png", "type": "article", "description": "The Business Plus article (\"The job of job hunting,\" Daily Camera, April 20) did the public a favor by focusing on the difficulty in job hunting.", "title": "Gordon Gray: How to find a job"}, "twitter": {"domain": "dailycamera.com", "description": "The Business Plus article (\"The job of job hunting,\" Daily Camera, April 20) did the public a favor by focusing on the difficulty in job hunting.", "title": "Gordon Gray: How to find a job", "url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/letters/ci_27991175/gordon-gray-how-find-job", "image": "http://local.dailycamera.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/1200x627/dailycamera.png", "site": "@dailycamera", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-04-26T19:22:10-0600", "sailthru.title": "Gordon Gray: How to find a job", "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "msvalidate.01": "9DAB14005AD5A9FFA4CA0EF58CC794BA", "google-site-verification": "07CC1xPDVU0znu496XTAjLyC32Ylj8zwWHlmrzx3pgY", "verify-v1": "TakAiHiDAOiNOP+m0YTx4DQeyjor+bTdc8e+pw6bDoI=", "y_key": "c9d9b53f7f5af674", "sailthru.site": "dailycamera.com", "pubDate": "2015-04-26T14:18:27-0600", "p": {"domain_verify": "867892b0357001538903740c75a206f0"}}, "article_summary": "BoulderNet has a philosophy of getting help for your job search and giving help to others in their job search.\nThe Business Plus article (\"The job of job hunting,\" Daily Camera, April 20) did the public a favor by focusing on the difficulty in job hunting.\nBoth articles emphasized networking as an important part of a successful job search.\nHaving referrals, introductions, contacts, and recommendations is critical in a successful job search; this is true electronically using LinkedIn.com and personally through active interaction with and purposeful development of one's network.\nI'll add my voice to the encouragement of actively networking in a job search."}
