GOP)--- who control the House of Representatives--- are going to sue the President. They're acting on the premise and principle that President Obama is never right and must be perpetually opposed. Affordable Care Act, comprehensive immigration reform, infrastructure, foreign policy, diplomatic appointments, balanced budget, voting rights, women's reproductive rights, same-sex marriage, gun control . Et cetera. Et cetera. Et cetera.\n\nIt's all the same. If Obama's name is on the label, toss it!\n\nSo John Boehner, like Yosemite Sam eternally hunting that rascally rabbit, will pursue his prey into the halls of justice. He got the blessings of his colleagues last Wednesday just before the summer recess began.\n\nAccording to the resolution authorizing the suit, President Obama has failed to implement provisions of the Affordable Care Act. ObamaCare as the Right affectionately calls it. Yes, the same ObamaCare the Republicans have grindingly opposed from its inception and the same ObamaCare they have voted down at least two score times since.\n\nYou get the idea. It's just another round of the GOP gumming up the works. Nothing constructive. Anything destructive.\n\nIt's been their power play since Obama took office when that flinty Kentuckian Senator Mitch McConnell vowed to stop at nothing in preventing Obama's reelection. He failed at that. But he and his party did succeed in doing one thing:\n\nNOTHING!", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.chicagonow.com/quark-in-the-road/2014/08/the-obstructionist-gop-branch-out-they-vote-to-sue-obama/", "image": "http://www.chicagonow.com/quark-in-the-road/wp-content/themes/chicagonow/images/large_cn_tool_kit.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "You probably have heard that the Grumpy Old Partisans (a.k.a.
