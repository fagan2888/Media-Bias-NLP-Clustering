But in many countries, this announcement is a death sentence. Experts estimate that up to 200 million women are missing in the world today due to gendercide, mostly in China and India.\n\nRead the amazing and uplifting story of the man who has saved 40,000 babies and counting from certain death!

Gendercide is violence against women and girls. No one supports the systematic elimination of females,\u201d the report said.\n\n\u201cOr so I thought. Just last week it was reported that it is now legal to selectively abort girls in the UK,\u201d she continued, \u201cWhere is the \u2018feminist\u2019 outcry? How does it advance women\u2019s rights to selectively abort hundreds of millions of girls, simply because they are future women? When faced with human rights atrocities of this scale, silence is complicity.\u201d\n\nBut she said there are all too many situations where \u201cgendercide\u201d isn\u2019t a choice.\n\n\u201cThere is a strong correlation between sex-selective abortion and coercion. Crushing social, economic, political and personal pressures in cultures with a strong son preference trample women carrying girls. Women in these cultures hardly select their daughters for abortion. They are forced,\u201d the report said.\n\n\u201cIn China, the birth ratio of girls to boys is the most skewed in the world: approximately 100 girls born for every 119 boys. Sons traditionally carry on the family name, work the fields, and take care of their parents in old age. A daughter joins her husband\u2019s family at marriage. There is a saying: \u2018Raising a girl is like watering someone else\u2019s garden.\u2019 The One Child Policy exacerbates the underlying son preference. When couples are restricted to a coercive low birth limit, women often become the focus of intense pressure by their husband and in-laws to ensure a boy.\u201d\n\nThe result is that now, according to expert estimates, there are 37 million more males than females living in China.\n\nThat results in human trafficking and sexual slavery, the report said.\n\n\u201cIt is a woman\u2019s right to choose to give birth to her daughters. Together, China and India comprise one third of the world\u2019s population. That one-third of the world\u2019s women are deprived of their right to bear girls is the biggest women\u2019s rights abuse on earth. This violent discrimination against women and girls deserves a passionate response from groups that stand for women\u2019s rights, whether on the right or on the left,\u201d the report said.\n\nThe foundation explained that it actually was a hospital administrator who alerted Women\u2019s Rights Without Frontiers that the ultrasound had indicated the unborn baby was female.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Free Press For A Free People Since 1997", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.1", "og": {"site_name": "WND", "description": "It\u2019s China and an ulstrasound reveals an unborn baby girl in a family known to use abortion to make sure its offspring are male.
