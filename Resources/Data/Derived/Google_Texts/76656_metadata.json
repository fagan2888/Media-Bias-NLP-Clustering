Christie has to get moving.\u201d\n\nThat means the fight for money, high-profile backers, and top-flight campaign staffers is on between the heavyweight establishment candidates, and it\u2019s Bush that\u2019s been the more aggressive candidate in the early going.\n\n\u201cBush and Christie are competing for similar supporters and donors and they run in the same establishment party circles,\u201d said Ryan Williams, a veteran of Mitt Romney\u2019s 2012 campaign.\n\nPolitical strategists say Christie can be believed when he says his decision to run remains independent of Bush\u2019s decision, and there\u2019s likely enough money for both of them in the early going.\n\nBush will tap his deep family political ties and donor network from Florida to Texas. Christie, meanwhile, has proved himself a prodigious fundraiser as head of the Republican Governors Association, and he has a lock on the lucrative New Jersey to New York cash pipeline.\n\n\u201cI think Christie assumed Jeb was running and was already reaching out to people in anticipation of that,\u201d Williams said. \u201cHe\u2019s been laying the groundwork almost since President Obama was reelected, so he has that network of support in place that will help if he decides to run. His core supporters won\u2019t be swayed by Bush, but if you\u2019re on the fence, you\u2019re taking stock of both of them right now.\u201d\n\nBut Christie, whose term as governor doesn't expire until 2017, is reaching the point where he\u2019ll have to decide to fully take the plunge and leave the job he loves for the national stage. He\u2019s also hamstrung on the fundraising end to some degree because of laws that forbid him from taking campaign cash from firms in his home state while he remains in office.\n\nIn a field with more than a dozen candidates presently mulling bids, and one that many view as the strongest Republicans have put forward in years, every dollar is going to count.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re working to corner those donors,\u201d said Ford O\u2019Connell, a Republican strategist. \u201cYou\u2019re talking about maybe having eight or nine candidates in the race. They\u2019re all looking to have enough money to make it the whole way through, and they\u2019ll all want to go big in Florida, which is hugely expensive.\u201d\n\nBush and Christie are viewed as the top tier of candidates expected to slug it out for the establishment mantle and the right to go head to head with one of the slew of potential contenders whose paths to the nomination go through the conservative base.\n\nPolls right now show both near the top of the field, thanks in large part to their strong name IDs. Still, both suffer from low support levels among the kinds of conservative voters who turn out in force in the early-voting primary and caucus states.\n\nIn a Marist College survey released this week, Bush and Christie came in first and third out of a 14 candidate field, but among Tea Party supporters, both finished behind former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, Dr. Ben Carson, Rep. Paul Ryan (Wis.) and Sen. Ted Cruz (Texas).\n\nBush\u2019s potential candidacy has been received coolly from many in conservative circles. While his supporters tout his record as Florida governor as something conservatives of all stripes should be able to get on board with, he\u2019s run afoul of that wing of the party on education and immigration.\n\nAnd Christie is still viewed skeptically by many conservatives who were rankled by his embrace of President Obama after Hurricane Sandy at the peak of the 2012 election.\n\nThey\u2019ll both need to maximize their support among more centrist-minded supporters. Strategists don\u2019t believe there are enough middle-of-the-road voters to propel more than one establishment candidate through the primaries.\n\n\u201cEarly states are going to whittle down the field to one establishment candidate and one Tea Party candidate who will emerge,\u201d Williams said. \u201cThat\u2019s how it works. In 2012, you had a number of upstarts, but at the end of the day it was Mitt [Romney] versus Rick [Santorum].\u201d\n\nThe establishment candidate who makes inroads with conservative-leaning Republicans could have a leg up. And here at least, it\u2019s Christie that\u2019s been the more aggressive of the two.\n\nWhile Bush has bristled at the notion of playing to the primary and appears ready to run a take-it-or-leave-it campaign, Christie has been reaching out to the Tea Party wing.\n\nThe New Jersey governor appeared at Rep. Steve King\u2019s (R-Iowa) annual pheasant hunt and fundraiser in Iowa earlier this year, a touchstone for any Republican candidate. He\u2019ll be back in Iowa next month for another summit hosted by King, which will also feature Tea Party stars like Cruz, Huckabee, Carson, Santorum, and former GOP vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin.\n\nChristie might be a perfect establishment foil for Bush in this regard. Much of the public has gotten to know him through short clips of him firing back at liberal attacks or forcefully defending his record, and that\u2019s something conservatives love.\n\n\u201cChristie stands out because of his strong leadership and willingness to take head on unions and other entrenched special interests,\u201d said Jeanette Hoffman, a Republican strategist from New Jersey. \u201cHe has a strong leadership style when compared to other candidates out there. He turns heads and makes people take notice and he\u2019s tapped into what conservatives think. They like his common sense approach to leadership.\u201d\n\nWhile he\u2019s burnished a brand for himself as a fighter willing to mix it up, that goes both ways.\n\n\u201cChristie cannot be out there getting into arguments with everyone,\u201d Bonjean said.\n\nRepublicans are eager to find out how Bush responds to Christie on the campaign trail. They say it was a smart move for him to get involved early because it\u2019s been a while since he ran for office and the political landscape has changed dramatically in the interim.\n\nBecause of that, he'll need to make the most of his head start.\n\n\u201cBush needed the head start, not just from the organizational and money standpoint, but also from the campaign standpoint and reminding people who he is from last time he was on the ballot,\u201d O\u2019Connell said. \u201cChristie hoped his timeline wouldn\u2019t get pushed up, but here it is. This definitely changes the calculus for him.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The former Florida governor\u2019s 2016 announcement impacts Christie and his own decision.", "description": "The former Florida governor\u2019s 2016 announcement impacts Christie and his own decision.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "rdfs": {"label skos": {"prefLabel": "Ballot Box"}}, "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "The former Florida governor\u2019s 2016 announcement impacts Christie and his own decision.", "title": "Jeb turns up heat on Christie", "url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/227775-bush-turns-up-heat-on-christie", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/blogs/christiechris_071214getty_0.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-12-20T14:56:19-05:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2014-12-20T14:56-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/227775-bush-turns-up-heat-on-christie", "dcterms.date": "2014-12-20T09:11-05:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Jonathan Easley", "author": "Jonathan Easley", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": ",Jeb Bush, Chris Christie,", "article": {"published_time": "2014-12-20T09:11:21-05:00", "modified_time": "2014-12-20T14:56:19-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/227775-bush-turns-up-heat-on-christie", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "The former Florida governor\u2019s 2016 announcement impacts Christie and his own decision.", "card": "summary", "title": "Jeb turns up heat on Christie"}, "dcterms.title": "Jeb turns up heat on Christie"}, "article_summary": "\u201cI think Christie assumed Jeb was running and was already reaching out to people in anticipation of that,\u201d Williams said.\nStrategists don\u2019t believe there are enough middle-of-the-road voters to propel more than one establishment candidate through the primaries.\n\u201cThe race to be the establishment candidate is happening now, it\u2019s in full swing.\n\u201cEarly states are going to whittle down the field to one establishment candidate and one Tea Party candidate who will emerge,\u201d Williams said.\nWith Chris Christie set to discuss a potential presidential bid with his family over the holidays, Jeb Bush\u2019s early moves in the GOP field may ratchet up the heat on the New Jersey governor."}
