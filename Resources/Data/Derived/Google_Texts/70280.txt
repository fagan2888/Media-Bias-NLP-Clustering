Trading Advantage Capital, a propriety trading division of Trading Advantage, today announced the funding of two female traders from the firm's June screening.

"I am very excited to announce that we are funding two trainees, who have dedicated themselves to learning the ins and outs of our trading and risk management system," said director of prop trading Tino Boccarsi . "These two women were both diligent students and took full advantage of the training tools available to them including the one-on-one sessions with the head trader."

The two women have followed different paths to becoming funded proprietary traders. Uranbaigal Purevsuren, a stay-at-home mother of three who is also studying for her doctorate, trades multiple futures markets including silver, currencies, the e-mini Nasdaq, Dow and S&P 500. After suffering initial drawdowns, Purevsuren rededicated to her training to refine her approach.

Elaine Blackstock , who trades with her son, received a fully funded trading account after nearly four months of enrollment in the program. Blackstock has successfully applied the risk management disciplines instilled by the Trading Advantage Capital team.

"One thing I always tell my incoming trainees about executing a trade," Boccarsi said, "is that if you can't tell me the market context surrounding your trade execution, the total risk of your trade, and why your profit targets are positioned at that specific price, you should never even think about entering a trade."
