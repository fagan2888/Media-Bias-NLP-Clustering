Trump is blasting his critics who say his plan to get rid of citizenship for children born in the United States, or anchor babies, is unconstitutional. But the billionaire real estate mogul, he is not backing down!\n\nPalin merely continued on the theme. \u201cHeck, yeah, it\u2019s possible\u201d to build a wall on the southern border and get Mexico to pay for it, she told Van Susteren. Palin claimed that Trump\u2019s \u201ccommonsense plans\u201d are what most Americans want but \u201cjust not being able to say because we don\u2019t have a microphone like he does.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe immigration plan of his, especially the wall, that\u2019s common sense,\u201d Palin added. \u201cIt\u2019s a real shot in the arm to constitutionalists and conservatives who want America to be put first by our leaders.\u201d\n\nOf course, Greta didn\u2019t challenge her BFF\u2019s notion that Trump \u2013 who wants to undo the 14th Amendment \u2013 is a constitutionalist. Instead, she wondered if his plan might be \u201csomewhat incomplete\u201d because a lot of the illegal immigration is not via Mexico but includes a lot of people who overstay their visas. \u201cWhat is he going to do, go round those people up?\u201d she asked Palin.\n\nObviously, Palin had no idea. \u201cHe\u2019s talking big picture, of course, plus specifics, thankfully,\u201d she replied. Then she changed the subject to say that Trump\u2019s plan is more specific than the other candidates. \u201cIt\u2019ll be great to hear all 16, 17 of them reveal their plan!\u201d she enthused. I'm sure she'll read all of them.\n\nNext, Palin blamed immigrants for \u201cdecimating the middle class\u201d and pretended that her nativism was due to concern for American minorities. Our \u201copen borders,\u201d Palin said, allow illegal immigrants \u201cto compete or take American jobs and really decimat(e) the middle class, especially young black men, young Hispanic men. Where their unemployment rates are 30%, 40% and cheap labor is going to make that even worse for them.\u201d\n\nVan Susteren never challenged a word. Instead, she moved on to ask Palin about Trump\u2019s desire to undo birthright citizenship, as guaranteed by the 14th Amendment. \u201cWhat do we do about the children?\u201d Van Susteren asked.\n\nAgain, Palin couldn\u2019t answer. She said that \u201cthe children\u201d will be used to portray Republicans as \u201cheartless\u201d when \u201cnothing could be further from the truth.\u201d She continued by arguing that preventing them from becoming citizens is the pro-family thing to do.\n\nPALIN: A plank in our platform is pro-family and a family is a unit and I believe what Mr. Trump and probably the other Republican candidates, once they do come out with some kind of policy proposals, what they\u2019re saying is, a family is a unit and if their parents broke the law and if they\u2019re here illegally, well, they need to get back in line and because a family is a unit, Greta. The family sticks together and the kids have to get in line with their mom and dad.\n\nHuffington Post notes that birthright citizenship was common law in the U.S. since its founding. When that right was suspended by the infamous Dred Scott decision by the Supreme Court, the ruling was supplanted by the 14th Amendment, ratified in 1868.\n\nBut Van Susteren never mentioned how radical a proposal denying birthright citizenship is nor did she question anything else Palin said. Instead, Van Susteren spent the rest of the segment trying to press Palin about whether or not she\u2019s endorsing Trump for president.\n\nWatch what passes for Fox News political analysis below, from the August 18 On The Record.", "article_metadata": {"csrf-param": "authenticity_token", "google-site-verification": "google51c0b549f514d464.html", "csrf-token": "lgxQo0aS6LoTNOmO7FgKp+bypayCO64OmiYammi2ccE=", "og": {"url": "http://www.newshounds.us/palin_thinks_denying_citizenship_to_u_s_born_children_is_pro_family_081815", "site_name": "NewsHounds", "image": "http://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/newshounds/sites/1/meta_images/original/Newshound3_blue.png?1327001871", "type": "article", "title": "Palin Thinks Denying Citizenship To U.S.-Born Children Is Pro Family"}, "Title": "Palin Thinks Denying Citizenship To U.S.-Born Children Is Pro Family"}, "article_summary": "But Van Susteren never mentioned how radical a proposal denying birthright citizenship is nor did she question anything else Palin said.\nVAN SUSTEREN: Trump fresh off jury duty and taking no prisoners!\n\u201cHeck, yeah, it\u2019s possible\u201d to build a wall on the southern border and get Mexico to pay for it, she told Van Susteren.\n\u201cWhat do we do about the children?\u201d Van Susteren asked.\nInstead, Van Susteren spent the rest of the segment trying to press Palin about whether or not she\u2019s endorsing Trump for president."}
