Or, to be accurate, while pumping in The Washington Post\u2019s lactation room \u2014 a closet-like space that requires maneuvering around an office chair to get to the sink (to clean pump parts), the microwave (to sterilize equipment) and the mini fridge (to store milk). Jung, a political scientist by training, offers enough skepticism about the benefits of nursing and pumping to make a mom wonder: Why in the world am I doing this?\n\nMuch of \u201cLactivism\u201d builds on Hanna Rosin\u2019s 2009 Atlantic article \u201cThe Case Against Breast-Feeding ,\u201d which included the memorable line: \u201cIt\u2019s only free if a woman\u2019s time is worth nothing.\u201d And no doubt Jung\u2019s book will revive debate about whether the health benefits are overstated. But she reviews the research from a perspective I can appreciate. \u201cSix women have to spend six months exclusively breastfeeding to prevent one ear infection?\u201d she writes. \u201cConservatively speaking, that\u2019s about 5,400 hours of breastfeeding to prevent one ear infection; 15,600 hours of breastfeeding to prevent a case of pneumonia.\u201d\n\nI had a similar reaction when the journal JAMA Pediatrics published a 2013 Harvard Medical School study suggesting that breast-feeding can boost IQ by four points. A measly four points? When the tests have a five-point margin of error? The study found that each month in a year of breast-feeding was associated with an additional 0.35 verbal IQ points and 0.29 nonverbal points. With some back-of-the-burp-cloth math, assuming 150 hours of breastfeeding per month, I figured each hour translated to 0.0023 verbal points and 0.0019 nonverbal points. Not too inspiring.\n\nLike Rosin, Jung isn\u2019t against breast-feeding. But she doesn\u2019t like that \u201cselective reading of medical literature\u201d has turned a lifestyle choice into a public health issue. She argues that \u201cbreastfeeding advocacy too often crosses the line into lactivism,\u201d limiting women\u2019s choices and punishing mothers and babies who don\u2019t conform to the prevailing moral standard.\n\nShe makes some good points, including that it\u2019s unfair to penalize women who don\u2019t have the flexibility in their lives \u2014 maternity leave, pumping breaks, etc. \u2014 to make breast-feeding a realistic option. But she overstates her case when she writes, \u201cNot one of the public breastfeeding initiatives launched since 1995 seems directed toward supporting women\u2019s own preferences and choices.\u201d\n\n\u201cLACTIVISM: How Feminists and Fundamentalists, Hippies and Yuppies, and Physicians and Politicians Made Breastfeeding Big Business and Bad Policy\u201d By Courtney Jung, 258 pp. $26.99 (Basic/Basic)\n\nJung lays out an intriguing analysis of how different groups have interpreted the \u201cbreast is best\u201d slogan to reflect their own agendas. Feminists tend to see breast-feeding as empowering. Conservative Christians see it as an affirmation of traditional gender roles, as well as evidence of intelligent design. Hipsters see it as an extension of the local food movement, while attachment-parenting adherents see it as essential to the mother-infant bond. (Jung identifies herself as a follower of \u201chalf-baked attached parenting,\u201d though \u201csemi-attached parenting\u201d would be a less clunky term.) With a bit of a leap, she concludes: \u201cNo wonder, then, that contemporary politicians have also embraced breastfeeding in large numbers. As a consensus issue, it has the potential to win them support from all sectors.\u201d\n\nIn medical research, telling women what to feed their babies is taboo \u2014 it would be unethical to conduct a randomized trial with one group assigned to breast-feeding and another to formula. Yet in public policy, there\u2019s little hesi\u00adta\u00adtion about pushing breast milk over formula. Are we comfortable with the incentives and disincentives governments have set up in the name of public health, with public money? It\u2019s worth a reappraisal. But most public policy on baby feeding isn\u2019t as coercive or as punitive as Jung makes it out to be.\n\nOne of her targets is Latch On NYC, a breast-feeding initiative by New York City\u2019s health department. She repeats criticisms that made the rounds when the campaign was announced in May 2012: that it required hospitals to keep formula \u201cunder lock and key\u201d and prohibited access \u201cunless it was medically indicated.\u201d The city dismissed both claims before the program launched: \u201cMothers can and always will be able to simply ask for formula and receive it free of charge in the hospital \u2014 no medical necessity required, no written consent required.\u201d\n\nJung raises the specter of big government by putting Latch On NYC in the context of then-Mayor Michael Bloomberg\u2019s moves to ban smoking, trans fats and supersize sodas. She doesn\u2019t mention that it\u2019s in line with the international Baby-Friendly Hospital Initiative, which includes hundreds of U.S. hospitals and birthing centers. I delivered twice at Baby-Friendly Georgetown, and I felt far more pressure from the people who want you to sign up for a baby photo shoot (not part of Baby-Friendly) than I did from the lactation consultants who are on call if you need them.\n\nJung argues that those lactation consultants limit women\u2019s choices. Many readers will agree that women who need or want formula should be able to get it, without grief. New mothers shouldn\u2019t have to fend off maternity ward lactivists like my colleague Emily Wax-Thibodeaux did \u2014 even after explaining that she couldn\u2019t produce milk because she\u2019d had cancer and a double mastectomy. \u201cIt may come out anyway, or through your armpits,\u201d one ill-informed lactation consultant pushed back.\n\nBut for women who can and may want to breast-feed, a nudge in the hospital can actually preserve choice. Nursing can be surprisingly hard. Many new mothers find the first few days and weeks exhausting, painful and frustrating. If they start their babies on formula in the midst of that frustration, before they\u2019ve had a real chance to weigh their options, they risk losing their milk supply and may find themselves unable to nurse, even if they want to.\n\nAnother program Jung criticizes is the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC), which she situates in the U.S. government\u2019s \u201clong history of using coercive tactics to get poor women to conform to its mandates.\u201d To make the case that the government is \u201ceffectively punishing poor mothers who didn\u2019t breastfeed, and their babies too,\u201d she describes how WIC offers different food packages to breast-feeding women and those using formula. \u201cWIC is clear that the reason it offers breastfeeding mothers more, and better, food is to provide \u2018incentives for mothers to breastfeed without [formula],\u2019 \u201d she writes.\n\nThat clause is in WIC\u2019s food package guidance issued in 2009, and, yes, the program is transparent about encouraging breast-feeding. But the first half of the sentence says packages for breast-feeding mothers and their infants are designed in part \u201cto supplement their special nutritional needs.\u201d Breast-fed babies, for instance, tend to have low levels of iron, so when they start eating solid foods they have more need for meat than babies getting iron in their fortified formula. And nursing mothers tend to need 300 to 500 calories above their normal daily diet. Jung implies that WIC is denying essential nutrients to formula-fed babies and their mothers, but that\u2019s just not true.\n\nAnd if we\u2019re going to debate the ethics of WIC distorting women\u2019s preferences, we should also talk about how it\u2019s the main purchaser of formula in the United States \u2014 responsible for 57 to 68 percent of all formula sold. WIC participants can get formula for free, which makes them more likely to go the formula route than mothers who don\u2019t participate in, but are eligible for, the program. And as much as WIC administrators try to make the breast-feeding package appealing, surveys find that because formula is normally so expensive, participants see the package for formula-fed infants and their mothers as the better deal.\n\nJung doesn\u2019t write about formula manufacturers\u2019 interest in WIC. She has a lot to say, though, about how the Affordable Care Act, which mandated insurance coverage of pumps, has \u201cbeen a boon to the corporate fortunes of companies that make breast pumps.\u201d Her account of the big bad breast pump industry is unconvincing. Even she admits that she \u201cdidn\u2019t find any evidence of such a lobby.\u201d And, as Ester Bloom notes in the Atlantic, suggesting that the breast-pump and nursing-accessories industries have anything near the resources of formula manufacturers is like comparing PBS and Comcast.\n\nJung echoes the New Yorker\u2019s Jill Lepore in her criticism that pumping policies take the pressure off employers to provide more generous maternity leave. Sure. But should we also give up on child-care reimbursement, or subsidized day care for babies, because it enables women to return to work and enriches the day-care industrial complex?\n\nIf her interest is in preserving women\u2019s choices, that should include the choice to pump during the workday. I may not love the lactation room at my office. But I\u2019m glad to have it.\n\nTwitter: @marisabellack", "article_metadata": {"description": "Courtney Jung\u2019s \u201cLactivism\u201d overstates its case.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/marisakatz", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Courtney Jung\u2019s \u201cLactivism\u201d overstates its case.", "title": "Just how bad are the breast-feeding police?", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/just-how-bad-are-the-breast-feeding-police/2015/11/24/d06bf5b6-8f0a-11e5-ae1f-af46b7df8483_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2015/11/24/Outlook/Images/iStock_000071066589_Double.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@MarisaBellack"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/just-how-bad-are-the-breast-feeding-police/2015/11/24/d06bf5b6-8f0a-11e5-ae1f-af46b7df8483_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "nonfiction", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/marisakatz"}, "eomportal-uuid": "d06bf5b6-8f0a-11e5-ae1f-af46b7df8483", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "nonfiction"}, "article_summary": "But she overstates her case when she writes, \u201cNot one of the public breastfeeding initiatives launched since 1995 seems directed toward supporting women\u2019s own preferences and choices.\u201d\u201cLACTIVISM: How Feminists and Fundamentalists, Hippies and Yuppies, and Physicians and Politicians Made Breastfeeding Big Business and Bad Policy\u201d By Courtney Jung, 258 pp.\n\u201cConservatively speaking, that\u2019s about 5,400 hours of breastfeeding to prevent one ear infection; 15,600 hours of breastfeeding to prevent a case of pneumonia.\u201dI had a similar reaction when the journal JAMA Pediatrics published a 2013 Harvard Medical School study suggesting that breast-feeding can boost IQ by four points.\n\u201cWIC is clear that the reason it offers breastfeeding mothers more, and better, food is to provide \u2018incentives for mothers to breastfeed without [formula],\u2019 \u201d she writes.\nThe study found that each month in a year of breast-feeding was associated with an additional 0.35 verbal IQ points and 0.29 nonverbal points.\nWith some back-of-the-burp-cloth math, assuming 150 hours of breastfeeding per month, I figured each hour translated to 0.0023 verbal points and 0.0019 nonverbal points."}
