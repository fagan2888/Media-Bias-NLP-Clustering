Nathan Deal\u2019s top aides, claiming that a recently revealed memo drafted by the ethics chief was proof that she was coerced into creating a \u201cpolitically favorable outcome\u201d for the governor.\n\nSabrina Smith of Georgia Watchdogs filed the complaint with the Office of the Inspector General claiming that executive counsel Ryan Teague and chief-of-staff Chris Riley, who has now joined the campaign, violated state law prohibiting government employees from coercing co-workers for political gain. You can find your copy here.\n\nThe complaint centers on the bombshell memo revealed in July written by ethics chief Holly LaBerge. She claims in the document that Deal\u2019s aides threatened her to make ethics complaints against their boss disappear.\n\nDeal campaign spokesman Brian Robinson said the complaint smacked of politics and that \u201crepetition of untrue statements doesn\u2019t make them true.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe file is riddled with so many inaccuracies and so much incorrect speculation that the complainant herself does not appear to take this seriously,\u201d he said. \u201cWhether by laziness or recklessness, this file discredits the accuser, not the accused.\u201d\n\nThe LaBerge memo is still rippling through state government. The complaint comes a day after a hearing in which a judge questioned why the memo, written in 2012, was only revealed publicly in July despite requests for similar documents by plaintiffs in whistleblower cases.\n\nIt\u2019s the second recent OIG complaint targeting the governor\u2019s staff. Clint Murphy, a former GOP operative turned critic of his party, filed an OIG request in July claiming that Deal press aide Sasha Dlugolenski violated a state ban on political activity during work time through a series of tweets she sent boosting her boss.\n\nSmith\u2019s complaint alleges that Riley and Teague used state resources and state time to try to coerce LaBerge to \u201csettle Gov. Deal\u2019s campaign matters for as little money as possible.\u201d It also claims the office unfairly granted LaBerge a special favor by supporting her application for the Leadership Georgia program.\n\nDeal has said that LaBerge was never threatened. The campaign said that Deal\u2019s private attorneys \u2013 not Riley and Teague \u2013 were involved in negotiating the final settlement for $3,350 in fees for technical defects on campaign disclosures, and note that the letter of recommendation was sent in June 2013 \u2013 long after the investigation was closed.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "Political Insider blog", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"url": "http://politics.blog.ajc.com/2014/08/26/watchdog-group-demands-investigation-of-nathan-deals-top-aides/", "image": "https://cmgajcpolitics.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/laberge1.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "A watchdog group\u00a0demanded\u00a0an internal investigation of Gov.
