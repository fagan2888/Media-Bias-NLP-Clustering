They\u2019re often about issues that governments cannot actually control: jobs, cultural shifts, viruses. And yet, they result in massive changes in what government does control\u2014like the makeup of the federal courts, or environmental regulations. Or, this year, the ways in which religious liberty (both real and imagined) is balanced against civil rights.\n\nFew voters, it\u2019s safe to say, cast their ballots based on the Religious Freedom Restoration Act. Yet, the headline-grabbing religious liberty conflicts of 2014\u2014the Hobby Lobby case, Arizona\u2019s \u201cTurn the Gays Away\u201d bill\u2014have not cooled off. On the contrary, with the results of this year\u2019s elections, they are about to heat up.\n\nHere are four developments we\u2019re likely to see in 2015.\n\nState RFRAs.\n\nSay it after me: RFRA. Riff-rah. It stands for \u201cReligious Freedom Restoration Act.\u201d The federal RFRA was passed in 1993, nearly unanimously, with liberals and conservatives uniting in response to a Supreme Court case, Employment Division v. Smith, which upheld anti-drug laws being used against Native Americans ingesting peyote. Outraged by this intrusion on a minority religious practice, RFRA provided that the government can only \u201csubstantially burden\u201d the exercise of religion if it has a \u201ccompelling state interest.\u201d\n\nThat language isn\u2019t just legalese; it decided Hobby Lobby. But thanks to a 1997 Supreme Court decision, it only applies to the federal government, not the states.\n\nAt the same time, right-wing activists have redefined \u201creligious liberty\u201d from a shield for minorities (like Native Americans) into a sword for majorities (like Christians who want to discriminate against gays or women). And so, since 1997, they have been busily passing RFRAs in 20 states (and counting), and strengthening the ones that already exist\u2014applying them to businesses, for example, or creatively redefining \u201csubstantial burden\u201d as any burden, no matter how insubstantial.\n\nRFRA madness is just getting started. In 2014, new or strengthened RFRAs were proposed in eight states. The \u201cTurn the Gays Away\u201d bill in Arizona was one of them. Now, with Republicans controlling 68 out of the 99 state legislative chambers (up from 59 before the election), expect to see State RFRAs proposed across the country. At least five (in Arizona, Georgia, North Carolina, Texas, and Utah) have already been announced.\n\nWhat would this mean? Individuals and businesses could exempt themselves from anti-discrimination laws by proffering religious objections to them. You could hang a big \u201cNo Gays Allowed\u201d sign on your hotel\u2019s front door. Or, more insidiously, you could send the same message by not recognizing your employees\u2019 legal spouses if they happen to be of the same sex.\n\nOf course, conservative activists took a beating when they tried this in Arizona last year. But they\u2019ll be smarter next time. Especially because of the\u2026\n\nGay Marriage Backlash.\n\nLet\u2019s face it: the arguments for religious exemptions look a lot better in red states that have suddenly had same-sex marriage \u201cforced\u201d on them by courts. Republican legislatures are looking for any way to stem the tide, and religious exemptions are one way to do that.\n\nExamples? Allow corporations to refuse benefits to same-sex spouses. (Remember, corporations have religious consciences now, thanks to Hobby Lobby.) Allow adoption agencies not to place kids with same-sex couples. Allow small businesses\u2014for-profit wedding chapels, caterers, florists\u2014to discriminate against gays. All of these exemptions already apply to religious organizations, but by way of RFRAs and other methods, they can be extended to corporations and individuals as well.\n\nThe goal? Keep the scare quotes around gay \u201cmarriage,\u201d or at least put an asterisk after it. By allowing religious individuals to reject a legal status, it\u2019s a little less legal. Or, perhaps more cynically, Republicans can cater to their religious conservative base while hiding beneath the neutral-sounding value of religious liberty. After all, who\u2019s against religious liberty?\n\nGet The Beast In Your Inbox!

As luck would have it, right in front of me were lawyers from the same firm representing the plaintiffs. And so, we had a collegial conversation in the last snowfall of the season. They felt confident of victory (and I tended to agree) and were talking about next steps.\n\nThe first is to extend Hobby Lobby to all contraceptives, not so-called \u201cabortofacients,\u201d a made-up, unscientific term that would soon be recognized as the meaningless distinction it has always been.\n\nNext is to extend the holding to all corporations, not just \u201cclosely-held\u201d ones. And to other parts of the Affordable Care Act, not just the so-called \u201ccontraception mandate.\u201d And even to the opt-out forms that the ACA has given religious organizations as an alternative to providing contraception coverage.\n\nTo win this last battle, the Right has found the best-named plaintiff in the history of activist litigation: the \u201cLittle Sisters of the Poor,\u201d a Catholic order that believes that by signing the \u201cNo\u201d form\u2014as in, No, we won\u2019t cover contraception\u2014they are effectively enabling someone else to say \u201cYes.\u201d Thus, they are complicit in the provision of such coverage, the exercise of such coverage, the use of an IUD, and the death of a sweet little blastocyst that the Sisters believe has a soul.\n\nOf course, \u201cNo means Yes\u201d is a novel logical syllogism, but anything is possible. And if the Little Sisters prevail, the entire contraception mandate falls. Which is likely in any case as part of...\n\nHobby Lobby: The Congressional Sequel\n\nRepublicans are champing at the bit to overturn as much of Obamacare as possible, and the \u201ccontraception mandate\u201d is a weak link in the chain. Religious and \u201creligiously-affiliated\u201d organizations are already exempt from that provision; now, under Hobby Lobby, closely held corporations are as well. But there\u2019s no need to wait for the courts to expand Hobby Lobby\u2019s exemption; in their zeal to tear up as much of the ACA as they can, expect bills to sail through the 114th Congress widening as many exemptions as possible.\n\nExamples? Ripping out the entire \u201ccontraception mandate,\u201d full stop.\n\nAllowing religiously affiliated organizations to opt out of Obamacare, period. Allowing corporations to avoid covering not just contraception, but any provision that they deem religiously offensive\u2014which could be, well, anything.\n\nEach of these steps would threaten the integrity of Obamacare as a whole, but of course, that\u2019s exactly the point.\n\nAll four of these developments are already underway, in think tanks, in media comments from public officials, and in draft legislation. And the big money is just getting started. Funders like the National Christian Foundation ($1.2 billion in assets); the Koch Brothers; and the Green (of Hobby Lobby fame), DeVos, Ahmanson, and Templeton foundations, continue to pour money into the \u201creligious liberty\u201d movement, funding organizations like Alliance Defending Freedom, The Becket Fund, The Ethics and Public Policy Center (headed by key leaders of The Gathering), The First Amendment Partnership, and a variety of pseudo-autonomous state groups like the Center for Arizona Policy, Sutherland Institute (Utah), and dozens of others. If nothing else, the sheer size of the \u201creligious liberty\u201d movement indicates its seriousness of purpose.\n\nSo does its breadth. At one extreme, these same conservative funders have founded biased \u201creligious liberty\u201d centers at Georgetown, Stanford, Princeton, and other leading universities. In the respectable guise of religious liberty, the zombie-like Culture War soldiers on.\n\nAt the other extreme, populist religious rhetoric has grown so outrageous, it\u2019s hard to be shocked anymore. The Obama administration is routinely analogized to Nazi Germany for conducting a \u201cwar on religion.\u201d The crusty conservative battle-ax Phyllis Schlafly is giving speeches saying that Obama worships government like a god. And somehow, this incendiary rhetoric is detached from the supposedly moderate, respectable \u201creligious liberty\u201d lawyers and academics who are funded by the same conservative billionaires.", "article_metadata": {"twitter": {"site": "@thedailybeast", "card": "summary", "creator": "jaymichaelson"}, "keywords": "Religious Freedom, Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc., Christians, U.S. News,", "publicationDate": 201411161045, "wrap": "/content/dailybeast/us-news", "description": "With wins in federal and state legislatures, Republicans gear up to exempt religious conservatives from any laws they don\u2019t like (especially the ones about gays and women).", "pageNum": 1, "title": "RFRA Madness: Whats Next for Anti-Democratic Religious Exemptions", "tags": "religious_freedom,entity:company/hobby_lobby_stores_inc,entity:company/christians,topic:us-news", "environment": "dev", "platform": "desktop", "template": "article", "type": "house", "parsely-page": "{\"title\":\"RFRA Madness: What\u2019s Next for Anti-Democratic \u2018Religious Exemptions\u2019\",\"link\":\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/11/16/rfra-madness-what-s-next-for-anti-democratic-religious-exemptions.html\",\"image_url\":\"http://cdn.thedailybeast.com/content/dailybeast/articles/2014/11/16/rfra-madness-what-s-next-for-anti-democratic-religious-exemptions/jcr:content/image.crop.410.273.jpg/47206290.cached.jpg\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":\"/content/dailybeast/articles/2014/11/16/rfra-madness-what-s-next-for-anti-democratic-religious-exemptions\",\"pub_date\":\"2014-11-16T10:45:00+00:00\",\"section\":\"U.S. News\",\"author\":\"Jay Michaelson\",\"tags\":[\"religious_freedom\",\"hobby_lobby_stores_inc\",\"christians\",\"us-news\"]}", "news_keywords": "Religious Freedom, Hobby Lobby Stores Inc, Christians, US News", "sectionTaxanomies": "us-news", "fb": {"admins": "1703087,30000737,1117577220,1276800108,931159,514915512", "app_id": 189930913679}, "authors": "Jay Michaelson", "article": {"section": "us-news", "published_time": "2014-11-16T10:45:00.000Z", "author": "http://www.thedailybeast.com/contributors/jay-michaelsonhtml"}, "resourceType": "dailybeast2/components/pages/article", "contentpath": "/content/dailybeast/articles/2014/11/16/rfra-madness-what-s-next-for-anti-democratic-religious-exemptions", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Beast", "description": "With wins in federal and state legislatures, Republicans gear up to exempt religious conservatives from any laws they don\u2019t like (especially the ones about gays and women).", "title": "RFRA Madness: What\u2019s Next for Anti-Democratic \u2018Religious Exemptions\u2019", "url": "http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/11/16/rfra-madness-what-s-next-for-anti-democratic-religious-exemptions.html", "image": "http://cdn.thedailybeast.com/content/dailybeast/articles/2014/11/16/rfra-madness-what-s-next-for-anti-democratic-religious-exemptions/jcr:content/image.img.2000.jpg/1416188705227.cached.jpg", "type": "article"}, "authorIds": "/etc/authors/j/jay-michaelson", "content-type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8"}, "_id": "\"57477afa6914bd0286fe5c8d\"", "article_summary": "Or, perhaps more cynically, Republicans can cater to their religious conservative base while hiding beneath the neutral-sounding value of religious liberty.\nOr, this year, the ways in which religious liberty (both real and imagined) is balanced against civil rights.\nYet, the headline-grabbing religious liberty conflicts of 2014\u2014the Hobby Lobby case, Arizona\u2019s \u201cTurn the Gays Away\u201d bill\u2014have not cooled off.\nIf nothing else, the sheer size of the \u201creligious liberty\u201d movement indicates its seriousness of purpose.\nIn the respectable guise of religious liberty, the zombie-like Culture War soldiers on."}
