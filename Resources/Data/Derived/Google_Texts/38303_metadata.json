Scott Walker \u2014 one of the GOP\u2019s leading 2016 contenders \u2014 attended a New York dinner hosted by supply-side grandees Art Laffer, creator of the notorious Laffer Curve; CNBC host Larry Kudlow; and Heritage Foundation chief economist Stephen Moore.

Rick Perry, who\u2019s gearing up for a second White House bid, kissed the supply-siders\u2019 rings last month.\n\nThat these men have become political powerbrokers attests to the sorry intellectual state of the GOP, Krugman contends. They don\u2019t just cling to the fantastical \u2014 and empirically disproven \u2014 idea that tax cuts will bring deficits down. They\u2019ve also made embarrassingly inaccurate forecasts about the Obama-era economy, predictions that have done nothing to damage their standing within the Republican Party.\n\n\u201c\u2018Get ready for inflation and higher interest rates\u2019 was the title of a June 2009 op-ed article in The Wall Street Journal by Mr. Laffer,\u201d Krugman notes, while \u201cwhat followed were the lowest inflation in two generations and the lowest interest rates in history.
