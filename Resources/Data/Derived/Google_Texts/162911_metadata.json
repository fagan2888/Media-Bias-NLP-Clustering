In California, families of four living on $33,465 or less now qualify for the state health-care program, and the amount of people uninsured nationwide has dropped considerably.\n\nBut how will the government pay for such expanded access? That was one big unanswered question posed last week by a handful of area health officials during a Visiting Nurse & Hospice Care-sponsored forum at the DoubleTree Resort.\n\nOne purpose of the Affordable Care Act was to increase preventative treatment, freeing up emergency rooms that have long been bursting at the seams. Since 2012, however, Santa Barbara ER visits have increased by about 1,400 patients every year. Just last year, the ER in Goleta saw a 12-14 percent uptick, and Santa Ynez\u2019s hospital ER saw an 11 percent hike.\n\n\u201cWe are actually busier now than we have been in a long time,\u201d said Cottage Executive Vice President Steven Fellows. To accommodate the influx, the hospital took steps toward doubling the number of ER beds with the demolition of its central wing last week; along with other upgrades, the renovations will allow for more than 60,000 visits each year. Goleta and Santa Ynez will also double the size of their ERs.\n\nDespite the increased volume, wait times for the ER haven\u2019t changed. On average, a Cottage patient waits 37 minutes to see a doctor (higher than the state and national average) and four hours and 18 minutes before being admitted to hospital (lower than the state and national average), according to ProPublica. Hospitals are required to evaluate everyone who arrives at an emergency room. At that point, \u201cwe might as well just treat you,\u201d Fellows said.\n\nA surge of patients \u2014 most newly insured \u2014 shows up on the weekends, perhaps when they have access to transportation, explained CenCal CEO Bob Freeman. \u201cOld habits die hard,\u201d he said, adding that health-care providers need to educate people about seeing a primary care doctor rather than waiting to go to the hospital, which is much pricier. \u201cTreat bronchitis [now] as opposed to pneumonia later,\u201d he added.\n\nWhile reimbursed care is going up, charity care services are going down. In 2012, the Cottage Health System provided $17 million in charity; in 2013, it decreased to $13 million. Last year, the amount was $8.5 million. \u201cThat\u2019s a good thing,\u201d Fellows said.\n\nThe shortage of primary care doctors was also discussed at the forum. \u201cWe have 50,000 new patients. We did not add 25 new primary care doctors,\u201d said Sansum Clinic CEO Kurt Ransohoff. \u201cYounger people aren\u2019t going into medicine,\u201d he added, pointing to medical school debt. Dr. Michael Bordofsky, speaking on behalf of independent physicians, said the future is bright for nurse practitioners, and Dr. Fred Kass with the Sansum Clinic Cancer Center offered the team health-care model as a possible solution.\n\nThe panelists also talked about end-of-life health care. They agreed it\u2019s a difficult but necessary conversation for people to have with their families. \u201cIf you don\u2019t have an advance directive, get an advance directive,\u201d Fellows declared.\n\nProviding care to seniors in their own homes is the Santa Barbara\u2013based program known as DASH (Doctors Assisting Seniors at Home); 1,200 people over age 60 have signed up, alleviating some of the ER congestion.\n\nAs they did at last year\u2019s forum, the panelists emphasized serious problems in the pharmaceutical industry \u2014 particularly with prices. \u201cIt\u2019s not all bad,\u201d Ransohoff said, noting illnesses that are now completely curable because of drugs, \u201cbut there\u2019s enough bad to talk about.\u201d The biggest issue, Ransohoff said, is direct consumer advertising with no price regulation, calling drug commercials with puppies playing on the beach while a voiceover lists negative side effects one of his biggest pet peeves. \u201cI think they should act out the side effects,\u201d he said.\n\nThough there was no mention of it at last week\u2019s forum, the potential merger of Sansum and Cottage is still on the table. The Attorney General\u2019s Office is still reviewing the proposal, which has remained unchanged since the news went public in 2013.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://media.independent.com/img/croppedphotos/2015/03/31/03262015_Visiting_Nurse_Phorum_03.jpg", "description": "Doctor Panel Talks Fiscal Consequences Of Obamacare, Physician Shortage.", "title": "Health Care Lands in the Emergency Room"}, "verify-v1": "ILofteeXjEGSBFwUf9oRyP4hdhxQ7F35jPp2MwAQrUE=", "y_key": "33d4a6dfbd23f58a", "description": "Doctor Panel Talks Fiscal Consequences Of Obamacare, Physician Shortage.", "title": "Health Care Lands in the Emergency Room"}, "article_summary": "Just last year, the ER in Goleta saw a 12-14 percent uptick, and Santa Ynez\u2019s hospital ER saw an 11 percent hike.\nOne purpose of the Affordable Care Act was to increase preventative treatment, freeing up emergency rooms that have long been bursting at the seams.\nWhile reimbursed care is going up, charity care services are going down.\nWe did not add 25 new primary care doctors,\u201d said Sansum Clinic CEO Kurt Ransohoff.\nSince 2012, however, Santa Barbara ER visits have increased by about 1,400 patients every year."}
