Robertson reviews the five ideologies of the 20th century: Nazism, Shintoism, Communism, Islam, and Atheism\u2013none of which include Jesus.\n\n\u201cNo Jesus with Hitler, with the Nazis. No Jesus. They wanted to dominate the world and they were famous for murder. The Shintoists came along. No Jesus there, Sean. They were famous for murder. They wanted to conquer the world. Look at the blood that was spilled with those two. Then comes Communism. No Jesus with them either and they wanted to conquer the world and they slaughtered millions. So you have murder, murder, murder.\u201d\n\nRobertson went on to compare the patterns of these ideologies with Islamic terrorism.\n\nAdvertisement \u2013 story continues below\n\n\u201cThen this latest crop pops their head up.

There\u2019s always an -ism or a theory that people expound on, Sean, when there is no Jesus.\u201d\n\nTrue to his faith, Robertson declared,\u201cI\u2019m sticking with Jesus, myself, man.\u201d\n\nRobertson quoted Patrick Henry regarding the founding of America.\n\nHannity wrapped up the interview by telling Robertson that he should be a pastor.\n\n\u201cI think you\u2019re a pastor at heart.
