John Kasich\u2019s plan to pay for cuts to the income tax with an array of tax increases took a beating Wednesday.\n\nKasich is pushing for $5.7 billion in tax cuts and $5.2 billion in tax hikes. The moves are part of House Bill 64, his budget for fiscal years 2016 and 2017.\n\nA former Fox News host and rumored Republican presidential candidate, Kasich frequently points to years of similar tax shifts as proof of his success.\n\nCenter-right Washington, D.C.-based nonprofits Americans for Tax Reform and Tax Foundation are encouraging lawmakers to consider alternatives to Kasich\u2019s HB 64 proposals.\n\n\u201cSound tax reform requires a state to lower their rates, broaden the base, and control spending. HB 64 does not achieve this,\u201d ATR president Grover Norquist wrote in a Wednesday letter to Ohio House Ways and Means Committee members.\n\n\u201cIt discriminates against specific industries and in the case of tobacco taxes, relies on a dangerous plan to use a declining source of revenue to enact income tax cuts. A thorough examination of Ohio\u2019s credits and deductions as a means of lowering income tax rates would be a far better starting point for engaging in true tax reform,\u201d Norquist added.\n\nBased on a summary from the governor\u2019s office, tax increases would pay for 91 percent of Kasich\u2019s income tax cuts and exemptions.\n\nAmong the many \u201crevenue changes\u201d in House Bill 64 is a $1 per pack cigarette tax hike Kasich pitches as good for public health \u2014 although he seeks to impose the new rate on far less harmful e-cigarettes, as well.\n\nAs introduced, HB 64 would sharply increase taxes on hydraulic fracturing or \u201cfracking\u201d for crude oil and natural gas, a revenue stream Kasich has overestimated in the past. The bill also calls for a 23 percent increase in the Commercial Activity Tax, created only 10 years ago.\n\nTax Foundation analyst Scott Drenkard was even critical of Kasich\u2019s proposal to exempt from the income tax the first $2 million in small business revenue \u2014 one of the governor\u2019s key HB 64 tax reform recommendations.\n\nDrenkard explained to the Ways and Means committee why Tax Foundation advises against such exemptions, expanding on points he made in a recent Forbes column.\n\n\u201cThe idea for excluding small businesses from tax liability is to promote job creation and growth in the state, but the unintended consequence of this policy is that it allows wage earners to change their structure to avoid paying any income taxes,\u201d Drenkard told the committee.\n\nDrenkard described several of Kasich\u2019s proposed tax hikes as \u201cparticularly economically damaging and non-transparent,\u201d calling the Commercial Activity Tax the state\u2019s \u201cmost growth-damaging tax\u201d and warning a cigarette tax hike would increase cigarette smuggling.\n\nA huge e-cigarette tax hike would run counter to Kasich\u2019s stated goal of curbing tobacco use, Drenkard explained, noting e-cigarettes contain thousands fewer chemicals than cigarettes.\n\n\u201cThe budget as proposed has glaring problems that amount to a slew of tax changes without a central theme,\u201d Drenkard told the House Ways and Means Committee.\n\nOthers testifying at the Wednesday hearing were there to support the cigarette tax hike, which several health experts endorsed as a way to limit smoking and reduce Medicaid costs.\n\nDr. Jim Duffee of the Ohio Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics testified that e-cigs \u2014 which contain no tobacco \u2014 should be taxed as if they were tobacco products.\n\n\u201cGiven the fact that e-cigs are most often used as a substitute for cigarettes, I strongly believe that equitable taxation between cigarettes, other tobacco products and e-cigs is perfectly justified and is in the best interest of public health and Ohio\u2019s children,\u201d Duffee told the committee.\n\nUnion front One Ohio Now, meanwhile, criticized Kasich\u2019s proposed sales tax hike, arguing against HB 64\u2019s income tax cuts and for even more dramatic spending increases.\n\nAlthough the General Assembly is certain to block at least some of Kasich\u2019s proposed tax hikes, Kasich is just as certain to leverage any net tax cut as a distraction from his budget-busting Obamacare Medicaid expansion.\n\nAt $523 million over two years, the governor\u2019s proposed annual tax cut would amount to less than the monthly cost of his Obamacare expansion, which has cost roughly $300 million per month since December.\n\nIn an attempt to bolster his \u201creform\u201d credentials, Kasich is traveling the country promoting a federal balanced budget amendment while his Obamacare expansion burns through billions in new federal spending.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Ohio Gov.
