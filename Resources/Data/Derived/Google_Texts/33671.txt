Former World Chess champion and political activist, Garry Kasparov, took to social media to express his outrage over Obama administrator’s assessment of Russia’s presence in the Ukraine as a “uncontested arrival.”

He tweeted on Friday: “WHAT?! MT @stephenfhayes: Admin tell CNN’s this is an ‘uncontested arrival’ not necessarily ‘an invasion’ & that this distinction is ‘key.’”

Mr. Kasparov has voiced his opinions on the Ukraine crisis via twitter frequently over the last week, drawing comparisons between Putin’s Russia and Nazi Germany.

“So far, the Kremlin & Kremlin stooges in Ukraine are following that same 1938 script. Talk of ‘protection,’ ‘peace,’ ‘self-determination,’” he tweeted on Thursday.

A few minutes later he added, “Putin has little choice but to act in Ukraine. Dictators, without legitimacy of elections, must regularly show their power.”

Mr. Kasparov has also used social media to urge the U.S. and other western powers to intervene in Ukraine.

On Thursday he tweeted: “West will have to act on Ukraine eventually. Question is how long, as price will keep going up. Post-Syria credibility is very low.”

And on Friday, he continued the commentary with criticism of President Obama’s strategy, tweeting: “Churchill on Obama: ‘decided to be undecided, resolved to be irresolute, adamant for drift, solid for fluidity, all-powerful to be impotent,’” he tweeted on Friday, and added, “There are always a million reasons for inaction, countless rationalizations for helplessness. Being resolute doesn’t require excuses.”

Mr. Kasparov was born in the Soviet Union and became the youngest undisputed World Chess Champion in 1985 at the age of 22.
