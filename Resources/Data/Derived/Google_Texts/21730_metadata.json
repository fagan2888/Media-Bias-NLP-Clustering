If you could only go back and warn that prior self \u2013 \u201cEven if the question is boring, don\u2019t look at your watch!\u201d \u201cMaybe don\u2019t take this one to 11, Howard.\u201d \u201cDid you really memorize this list? Really?\u201d \u2013 maybe disaster could be avoided and your political career saved.\n\nOf course, we know that time machines of the Hollywood sort are impossible in this universe, for the simple reason that a strangely garbed man did not appear out of nowhere to murder George Lucas in 1983. Yet this past week we found both Mitt Romney and Barack Obama apparently longing for the same elusive technology to help them undo the mistakes of prior elections.\n\nFor President Obama, the mistakes are in the most recent 2014 cycle: despite the defensiveness of the White House, it\u2019s obvious that he, like most Democrats, is wishing he\u2019d focused more on stagnant middle class wages and boosting working class pocketbooks instead of on class warfare income inequality rhetoric.\n\nOf course, the plan is completely bollixed, a mutant Room To Grow that retains much of the election era animosity for the rich while embracing a perverse approach to warping family decisionmaking on the way to boosting incomes. For just one example: consider that Obama\u2019s tax credit for two income families would effectively establish a tax penalty for those households with a stay at home parent and a breadwinner. That sounds like a great idea all around with no negative consequences.\n\nFor Mitt Romney, the need for a time machine is clearer: you can almost see him writing on the floorboards, \u201cThey\u2019re not the 47 percent! You like poor people too!\u201d It\u2019s a desperate fight for the last war, but Romney certainly wants to win it. If he ran in 2012 as the rich smart technocrat who can fix the economy, harsh and severe and prepared to do battle with the moochers, he seems to want to run in 2016 as the compassionate philanthropist with a prescient view of foreign policy and a heart of gold for the working poor. That\u2019s fine, but it\u2019s a public relations strategy, not a campaign.", "article_metadata": {"item-publish-date": "Mon, 19 Jan 2015 12:57:40 EDT", "og": {"site_name": "The Federalist", "description": "In this edition of Thunderdome: Mitt Romney and Barack Obama want to warn their past selves of mistakes.", "title": "Thunderdome: There Is No Such Thing As Time Travel", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://thefederalist.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/14997552775_c4eb8db465_b.jpg", "url": "http://thefederalist.com/2015/01/19/thunderdome-there-is-no-such-thing-as-time-travel/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Federalist", "description": "In this edition of Thunderdome: Mitt Romney and Barack Obama want to warn their past selves of mistakes.", "title": "Thunderdome: There Is No Such Thing As Time Travel", "image": {"src": "http://thefederalist.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/14997552775_c4eb8db465_b.jpg"}, "creator": "@bdomenech", "site": "@FDRLST", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article": {"section": "Thunderdome", "tag": "2016,Barack Obama,Mitt Romney,State of the Union,Thunderdome", "published_time": "2015-01-19T12:57:40+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "In this edition of Thunderdome: Mitt Romney and Barack Obama want to warn their past selves of mistakes."}, "article_summary": "For Mitt Romney, the need for a time machine is clearer: you can almost see him writing on the floorboards, \u201cThey\u2019re not the 47 percent!\nYet this past week we found both Mitt Romney and Barack Obama apparently longing for the same elusive technology to help them undo the mistakes of prior elections.\nYou like poor people too!\u201d It\u2019s a desperate fight for the last war, but Romney certainly wants to win it.\nIn presidential politics as in life, there are few desires more powerful than the longing for a time machine.\nReally?\u201d \u2013 maybe disaster could be avoided and your political career saved."}
