2. New Mexico's top court says gay marriage is legal

New Mexico's Supreme Court ruled Thursday to allow same-sex marriage in the state. The unanimous decision makes New Mexico the 17th state to legalize gay marriage, and clears up confusion that allowed a patchwork system in which some New Mexico counties permitted gay and lesbian couples to marry, and others didn't. The court said barring gay marriage was unlawful discrimination based on sexual orientation. [Reuters]
