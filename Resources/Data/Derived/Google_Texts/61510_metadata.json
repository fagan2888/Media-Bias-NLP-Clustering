It will better equip airlines to manage similar emergency situations, he said.\n\nRelated: FAA Shutdown Could Cost Taxpayers Over $1 Billion\n\n\u201cWith NextGen capabilities fully operational, we will be able to provide many more options for rapidly reconfiguring our facilities,\u201d FAA administrator Michael Huerta told a conference in Chicago.\n\nFederal auditors, however, aren\u2019t so sure. They say the project, which is hundreds of millions of dollars over budget and is years behind schedule, isn\u2019t worth the trouble. \u201cUltimately, FAA determined that the total costs for the current ADS-B [NextGen] program, including funding that has been spent, now outweigh the projected benefits of the program by as much as $588 million,\u201d according to the latest Inspector General report.\n\nNextGen \u2013 or ADS-B, as it\u2019s often called \u2013 will eventually shift the U.S. ground-based air traffic control system to a satellite-based system. The project in theory is supposed to cut costs by using GPS technology to save time, fuel and money, as well as curb traffic delays. Auditors, though, say any cost savings are unclear.\n\nThe FAA estimates it will cost about $4.5 billion through 2035 \u2013 about $400 million more than original estimates. And, like other government estimates, the IG warns the price tag could climb even higher.\n\nMany airlines aren\u2019t equipping their planes with the required new technology, which tells pilots where they are in relation to other aircrafts, thus making it safer to fly closer together. Airlines are hesitant to invest given the uncertainty about the program; the spate of scathing federal audits aren\u2019t helping.\n\nMoreover, watchdogs have been warning of potential problems for years. In 2009 the FAA\u2019s IG told Congress that the project\u2019s costs, schedule and benefits were all \u201cuncertain.\u201d The IG described delays in approving new procedures and technology as well as pushback from the airlines, which have been hesitant to invest in the equipment. Then, in 2011, the Government Accountability Office released a report raising similar concerns about the project\u2019s increasing costs and delays.\n\nRelated: Flights Delayed by FAA Furloughs\n\nFederal auditors are once again circling back to those concerns, this time with more data. \u201cThe inspector general\u2019s findings raise significant questions about whether the system will be ready by 2020, adding to the aviation community\u2019s confusion about when and how to equip,\u201d Mark Baker, president of the Airline Owners and Pilots Association, told The National Journal.\n\nEven if all the airlines got on board, there are plenty of other problems the NextGen system hasn\u2019t addressed. For instance, FAA officials said the new system hadn\u2019t considered the important issue of how to manage all the commercial drones expected to take to the skies in the next decade, according to The Guardian.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t understand the magnitude to which [drones] would be an oncoming tidal wave, something that must be dealt with, and quickly,\u201d Ed Bolton, the Federal Aviation Administration\u2019s assistant administrator for NextGen, told The Guardian.\n\nThis is problematic: The FAA has already installed the software needed for several of the project\u2019s main systems. Making further changes to accommodate drones could prove difficult \u2013 and expensive.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "After a fire at an air traffic control center in Chicago", "title": "Why the FAA\u2019s $4.1B NextGen May Be a Flight Risk", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/09/29/Why-FAA-s-41B-NextGen-May-Be-Flight-Risk", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/slideshows/09072011_Stealth_airline_slideshow.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/09/29/Why-FAA-s-41B-NextGen-May-Be-Flight-Risk", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/slideshows/09072011_Stealth_airline_slideshow.jpg", "creator": "@Briannaehley", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "After a fire at an air traffic control center in Chicago", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdcfcf\"", "article_summary": "Even if all the airlines got on board, there are plenty of other problems the NextGen system hasn\u2019t addressed.\nNextGen \u2013 or ADS-B, as it\u2019s often called \u2013 will eventually shift the U.S. ground-based air traffic control system to a satellite-based system.\nThe agency\u2019s top chief addressed those concerns on Monday by touting the FAA\u2019s multi-billion dollar project, the Next Generation Air Transportation System, otherwise known as NextGen.\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t understand the magnitude to which [drones] would be an oncoming tidal wave, something that must be dealt with, and quickly,\u201d Ed Bolton, the Federal Aviation Administration\u2019s assistant administrator for NextGen, told The Guardian.\nThen, in 2011, the Government Accountability Office released a report raising similar concerns about the project\u2019s increasing costs and delays."}
