Mike Huckabee, who announced this week that he would seek the Republican nomination for president in 2016, is bucking most of his party by opposing a looming trade deal sought by the Obama administration.\n\nHuckabee put that opposition in, well, colorful terms during an interview with NBC\u2019s Andrea Mitchell on Wednesday. He said the deal would lead workers to \u201ctake it in the backside\u201d because of lower wages and by companies shipping more jobs overseas.\n\n\u201cWhen there\u2019s cronies involved and getting a special deal and when other countries are cheating and Americans lose jobs,\u201d Huckabee said, \u201cI\u2019d like to think the U.S. government would stand up for the U.S. workers rather than let them take it in the backside and somehow just have to tough it out.\u201d\n\nHowever ineloquently, Huckabee is noting the concerns of a handful of conservative Republicans \u2014 and many Democrats \u2014 who either oppose or are skeptical of the trade deal, which President Barack Obama has painted as essential for American globalization.\n\nHuckabee\u2019s position puts him more in line with liberal firebrand Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Massachusetts) or Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders than many of his Republican counterparts on the trail.\n\nHuckabee is more opposed to the concept of \u201cTrade Promotion Authority,\u201d legislation that is working its way through Congress right now. That legislation would provide Obama the ability to \u201cfast track\u201d the agreement and bring it to Congress for an up-or-down vote, rather than subjecting it to potential tweaks and amendments from each individual member.\n\nThere are two trade deals in the works that the so-called \u201cfast track\u201d authority would affect, but the closest to completion is the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which the U.S. is negotiating with 11 other Asian-Pacific nations.\n\nDuring his presidential announcement in Arkansas on Tuesday, Huckabee called that deal \u201cunbalanced\u201d and said it could drive workers\u2019 wages \u201clower than the Dead Sea.\u201d\n\n\u201cFast-track means that nobody\u2019s paying attention. The last time we really fast-tracked something was Obamacare,\u201d Huckabee told MSNBC on Wednesday. \u201cWhy do we ever want to again believe that the government fast-tracking something without thoroughly understanding the implications is the best way to go?\u201d\n\nObama and his unusual allies in the Republican Party \u2014 along with a few Democrats \u2014 have argued that \u201cfast track\u201d authority is necessary for the deal to be completed. After all, that would mean the 11 other countries privy to the deal would be, in essence, negotiating with not only the administration, but also with 535 members of Congress.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Former Arkansas Gov.", "msapplication-config": "http://fusion.net/wp-content/themes/fusion-theme/assets/images/favicons/browserconfig.xml?v=1462067892199", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Fusion.net", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "pocket-site-verification": "81a5587d6c56043280b2554922f43d", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Fusion", "description": "Former Arkansas Gov.", "title": "Mike Huckabee Uses Unfortunate Phrasing to Make Valid Point About Trade Deal", "url": "http://fusion.net/story/131526/mike-huckabee-trade-deal-tpp-take-it-in-backside/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://i1.wp.com/fusion.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/472249234.jpg?resize=1200%2C630&quality=80&strip=all", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Former Arkansas Gov.", "title": "Mike Huckabee uses unfortunate phrasing to make valid point about", "url": "http://fusion.net/story/131526/mike-huckabee-trade-deal-tpp-take-it-in-backside/", "image": "http://i1.wp.com/fusion.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/472249234.jpg?resize=560%2C294&quality=80&strip=all", "site": "@fusion", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#da532c", "p": {"domain_verify": "c6a5260d31ead375c331934cb6df4833"}, "fb": {"app_id": 796694167041552}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://fusion.net/wp-content/themes/fusion-theme/assets/images/favicons/mstile-144x144.png?v=1462067892199", "application-name": "Fusion.net", "msvalidate.01": "0EABD001D404EA9DDE2025E9E4F14CAF", "google-site-verification": "BKw_9qDU04u2w1WoNF53fplAwWXVK_DJ1b6rZDR5u-M", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "news_keywords": "Politics,Elections"}, "article_summary": "Mike Huckabee, who announced this week that he would seek the Republican nomination for president in 2016, is bucking most of his party by opposing a looming trade deal sought by the Obama administration.\nHuckabee is more opposed to the concept of \u201cTrade Promotion Authority,\u201d legislation that is working its way through Congress right now.\nThere are two trade deals in the works that the so-called \u201cfast track\u201d authority would affect, but the closest to completion is the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which the U.S. is negotiating with 11 other Asian-Pacific nations.\nHe said the deal would lead workers to \u201ctake it in the backside\u201d because of lower wages and by companies shipping more jobs overseas.\nHuckabee put that opposition in, well, colorful terms during an interview with NBC\u2019s Andrea Mitchell on Wednesday."}
