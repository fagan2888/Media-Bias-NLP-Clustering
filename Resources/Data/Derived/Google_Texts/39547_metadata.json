Dr. Francis Collins , director of the National Institutes of Health and a PCORI board member, called the organization's efforts \u201ca major step forward\u201d for the discipline. The independent not-for-profit institute was established and gets its funding under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act \u201cThis initiative will provide an unprecedented opportunity to streamline clinical trials, empower patients and build a solid foundation for personalized medicine,\u201d Collins wrote in a blog post . \u201cNIH is thrilled that these organizations have come together and agreed to create a single, overarching network that will be seamlessly integrated using electronic databases. But the real excitement will come once we see this network in action: helping to speed efforts by clinical researchers to test the treatments and cures that so many people urgently need.\u201d\n\nThe funding is 37% more than PCORI said in April it would spend on the effort this year. PCORI spokeswoman Christine Stencel said the increase was in response to the volume and quality of award applications the organization received. \u201cThere's quite a bit of excitement about the network's potential to increase comparative effective research efficiency,\u201d she said.During a Dec. 17 meeting (PDF) , the PCORI board approved spending $191 million to fund 82 comparative research projects, which included grants to build the patient-centered clinical research network The $93.5 million will be split among 18 research networks focused on patients with a particular conditions who are interested in sharing health information and 11 clinical data research networks with healthcare systems collecting data during the routine course of delivering care.One of those 11 networks is the Chicago Area Patient-Centered Clinical Outcomes Research Network , or CAPriCORN, an initiative that includes nine regional healthcare provider institutions (including local Veterans Affairs Department hospitals) and 11 other organizations coordinated by the Chicago Community Trust charity foundation with administrative support from the Illinois Medical District Commission.CAPriCORN received an 18-month, $7 million award to go toward building a data infrastructure intended for use in improving outcomes and lowering costs in the treatment of anemia, asthma, diabetes, obesity, recurrent clostridrium difficile and sickle cell disease.\u201cWe need to make better use of the data that is collected every single day,\u201d said Dr. Jerry Krishnan, University of Illinois associate vice president for population health services and a principle investigator for the project. \u201cIt isn't just about generating research for a medical journal to be put on a shelf.\u201dKrishnan said the participating institutions will collect clinical and administrative data and create a clinical data registry. Advisory groups will identify knowledge gaps and help direct research, interpret and disseminate findings, and implement strategies to put them into practice.Patient clinical and claims data will be linked, so the network will take steps to protect privacy by \u201cborrowing and learning\u201d from integrated systems such as the VA and managed-care organizations.Because of set budgets and timelines, CAPriCORN was formed by organizations that had experience working together on similar efforts, but the participants hope that others will join.PCORI has awarded almost $465 million for 279 comparative effectiveness research projects since last year. Its link to the still-controversial healthcare reform law has been the source of some criticism, and comparative effectiveness research is also seen by some as a tool to coerce doctors to conform to practices dictated by research findings.\u201cComparative effectiveness, at its core,\u201d Krishnan countered, \u201cis about generating information that's useful for patients and clinicians to make decisions about treatment options.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#0a365e", "description": "The nation's ability to conduct efficient comparative-effectiveness research\u2014the study of what does and doesn't work in clinical practice\u2014is getting a $93.5 million jolt from the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to erect a clinical research network.", "title": "Healthcare Reform Update: PCORI to fund $93.5 million for clinical research network", "og": {"site_name": "Modern Healthcare", "description": "The nation's ability to conduct efficient comparative-effectiveness research\u2014the study of what does and doesn't work in clinical practice\u2014is getting a $93.5 million jolt from the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to erect a clinical research network.", "title": "Healthcare Reform Update: PCORI to fund $93.5 million for clinical research network", "url": "http://www.modernhealthcare.com/article/20131218/NEWS/312189956", "image": "http://www.modernhealthcare.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/CH/20131218/NEWS/312189956/AR/0/Francis-Collins.jpg&maxw=1200&maxh=630", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "http://www.modernhealthcare.com", "description": "The nation's ability to conduct efficient comparative-effectiveness research\u2014the study of what does and doesn't work in clinical practice\u2014is getting a $93.5 million jolt from the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to erect a clinical research network.", "creator": "@modrnhealthcr", "image": "http://www.modernhealthcare.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/CH/20131218/NEWS/312189956/AR/0/Francis-Collins.jpg&imageversion=thumbnail&maxw=240&maxh=240", "title": "Healthcare Reform Update: PCORI to fund $93.5 million for clinical research network", "site": "@modrnhealthcr", "card": "summary"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Modern Healthcare", "published_at": "2013-12-18", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "url": "http://www.modernhealthcare.com/article/20131218/NEWS/312189956", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "msapplication-TileImage": "https:/raw.githubusercontent.com/modernhealthcare/mh-logo/master/ms-touch-icon-144x144-precomposed.png", "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "image": "http://www.modernhealthcare.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/CH/20131218/NEWS/312189956/AR/0/Francis-Collins.jpg&maxw=360&maxh=240", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8125\"", "article_summary": "The nation's ability to conduct efficient comparative-effectiveness research\u2014the study of what does and doesn't work in clinical practice\u2014is getting a $93.5 million jolt from the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to erect a clinical research network.\n\u201cIt isn't just about generating research for a medical journal to be put on a shelf.\u201dKrishnan said the participating institutions will collect clinical and administrative data and create a clinical data registry.\nDr. Francis Collins , director of the National Institutes of Health and a PCORI board member, called the organization's efforts \u201ca major step forward\u201d for the discipline.\nPCORI spokeswoman Christine Stencel said the increase was in response to the volume and quality of award applications the organization received.\n\u201cNIH is thrilled that these organizations have come together and agreed to create a single, overarching network that will be seamlessly integrated using electronic databases."}
