Circuit. Hours later, senators confirmed Chai Feldblum to another term on the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission by a largely party-line vote of 54-41.\n\nEarlier in the week, the Senate confirmed the long-stalled nomination of Rep. Melvin L. Watt, North Carolina Democrat, by a 57-41 vote to head the Federal Housing Finance Agency, which regulates mortgage gains Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The Senate also approved the nomination of Patricia A. Millett to serve on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit by a vote of 56-38.\n\nIt\u2019s unlikely that any of the nominations would have been approved without Senate Democrats\u2019 action last month, sanctioned by the White House, to eliminate the traditional requirement for a supermajority of 60 votes to break a filibuster over a presidential nominee. Republicans vehemently opposed the change, which allows the majority party, currently the Democrats, to break filibusters with 51 votes.\n\nRepublican lawmakers angered by the power play said this week that they would look for other ways to fight presidential nominations through next year.\n\n\u201cAll of us know what this is about,\u201d said Sen. Mike Johanns, Nebraska Republican. \u201cThis is about control of this body.\u201d\n\nIt goes beyond control of the Senate, to the fate of Mr. Obama\u2019s second-term agenda. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, Kentucky Republican, said the Democrats\u2019 push is aimed at installing friendly judges on the powerful D.C. Circuit Court, which rules on actions by federal agencies and on programs such as the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cThe American people should know what the liberal playbook is,\u201d Mr. McConnell said. \u201cThe left believes the president\u2019s agenda runs straight through the D.C. Circuit Court. Anything it takes to get this president\u2019s agenda around the checks that have been established to restrain power. Anything it takes to get around anybody who disagrees with them, whether it is Obamacare or the judges they expect to defend it. Anything it takes, they are willing to do.\u201d\n\nMajority Leader Harry Reid, the Nevada Democrat who deployed the \u201cnuclear option\u201d to change Senate rules, said Republicans are reaping what they sowed with years of obstruction. He said Republicans\u2019 stalling tactics that lasted into Thursday morning were more proof that he needed to change the rules.\n\n\u201cWhy are they doing this?\u201d Mr. Reid said. \u201cWhat is this supposed to accomplish? It is showing the American people why the rules had to be changed. We were wasting all of our time on nominations and not allowing us to have any time to get to substantive legislation. And it\u2019s not fair. This president, any president, not to be able to have a team in place that \u2014 President Obama\u2019s been trying to do this for five years.\u201d\n\nWithout the filibuster, Republican senators probably will rely more often on the \u201cblue slip\u201d practice to block judicial nominees, said Carl Tobias, professor of law at the University of Richmond School of Law. Blue slips signal senators\u2019 approval or disapproval of nominees from their home states.\n\nMr. Tobias said some Republican senators also are likely to continue refusing to submit names of potential judicial nominees from their home states to the White House.\n\n\u201cThey haven\u2019t been systematically suggesting people to the White House, and the White House won\u2019t nominate someone who doesn\u2019t have home-state senator support,\u201d Mr. Tobias said. \u201cSo they can bring it to a halt in every state where they have one senator.\u201d\n\nMore than 80 judicial seats nationwide are vacant.\n\nAlthough many of Mr. Obama\u2019s nominations have been contested, none has been opposed by Republicans more actively than the candidates for the D.C. Circuit such as Judges Pillard and Millet. The federal appeals court is considered the second most powerful court in the nation and a steppingstone to the Supreme Court.\n\nThe president hailed Judge Pillard\u2019s confirmation Thursday and noted that the 11-seat court will have five women on the bench for the first time in history.\n\n\u201cThroughout her career, Ms. Pillard has displayed an unwavering commitment to justice and integrity,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cHer landmark accomplishments on behalf of women and families include Supreme Court cases defending the constitutionality of the Family and Medical Leave Act and opening the doors of the Virginia Military Institute to female students. I\u2019m confident she will be a diligent, thoughtful and judicious addition to the D.C. Circuit.\u201d\n\nMr. McConnell said she is a \u201cliberal ideologue\u201d and an activist on the abortion issue, and could be hostile to the freedom of religion.\n\n\u201cIt is an understatement to say that these sorts of views are worrying for someone the president wants on one of our nation\u2019s top courts,\u201d Mr. McConnell said. \u201cShe seems like a person with the attitude and disposition of a left-wing academic.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "President Obama and Senate Democrats pushed through a raft of administration nominees this week after changing the chamber's rules, leaving Republicans to consider a dwindling array of tactics to check the president's power.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "President Obama and Senate Democrats pushed through a raft of administration nominees this week after changing the chamber\u2019s rules, leaving Republicans to consider a dwindling array of tactics to check the president\u2019s power.", "title": "Senate\u2019s filibuster rule change opens floodgates for Obama nominees", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/dec/12/senates-filibuster-rule-change-opens-floodgates-fo/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2013/12/12/12122013_republicans-congress8201.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2013/12/12/12122013_republicans-congress8201.jpg", "description": "President Obama and Senate Democrats pushed through a raft of administration nominees this week after changing the chamber's rules, leaving Republicans to consider a dwindling array of tactics to chec", "card": "summary", "title": "Senate\u2019s filibuster rule change opens floodgates for Obama nomin"}, "Author": "Dave Boyer", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Politics, Nina Pillard, Senate, Mitch Mcconnell, White House"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd27d\"", "article_summary": "Circuit Court.\nCircuit Court, which rules on actions by federal agencies and on programs such as the Affordable Care Act.\nThe Senate also approved the nomination of Patricia A.
