Gujarat Chief Minister and BJP’s prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi yesterday found an ardent supporter in melody queen Lata Mangeshkar who said she would like to see him taking the top job.

After Modi inaugurated a new hospital complex named after her late father Deenanath Mangeshkar at a function here, Lata, in a brief address, said “Narendrabhai is like my brother. All of us want to see him become the Prime Minister. On the auspicious occasion of Diwali, I hope our wishes would come true.”

Modi, on his part, lauded the Mangeshkar family saying they had, “with their divine voices, delighted crores of people making them stress-free with music and making their minds and bodies healthy“.

Modi also said on this occasion that the country needed a comprehensive health policy to make health care affordable.

“We do not need just health insurance but also health assurance,” he said, adding the common man should find health care affordable.

Hailing the phase two super—speciality project of Deenanath Mangeshkar Hospital, Modi underlined the importance of preventive health care and development of skilled manpower in the health sector.

“With our talented doctors and technology, we can gain reputation in an era of health tourism,” the Gujarat Chief Minister said.

Recalling the instance of a Pakistani girl who was operated on in a Bangalore hospital some time back, he said this act built a bridge of compassion touching hearts of all Pakistanis.

“With our talent and skilled manpower, India can carve a niche for herself in the world in the global health sector,” he said.
