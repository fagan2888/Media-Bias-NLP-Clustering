If you think that city took a long time to come to its senses, get a load of this:\n\n\n\n\n\nDespite the bans, people still played pinball, just as they drank alcohol during Prohibition. Flippers were invented in the 1940s, and by the 1950s and '60s the game was more popular than ever. By then, most cities moved on to more pressing matters and the laws were largely forgotten.\n\n\n\nBut next week, the City Council's public safety committee is poised to reverse Oakland's law that bans pinball machines, as part of a broader look at gambling in the city.\n\nIn Oakland's case, the law is still on the books but hasn't been enforced for decades. There are other cities, however, where the local pinball regulations still have teeth:\n\nBeacon, N.Y., about 40 miles north of New York City, shut down a pinball museum and arcade in 2010 because of its historical ban. In San Francisco, pinball is legal but owners need a permit from the entertainment commission.\n\n\n\nIt's still illegal in Alameda[, California]. The Pacific Pinball Museum had to register as a nonprofit and remove the coin slots from its machines to comply with the law.\n\nTo read more about anti-game crusades, go here.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "But it's not the last city with a ban on the books.", "title": "Oakland Gets Ready to Legalize Pinball", "url": "http://reason.com/blog/2014/06/20/oakland-gets-ready-to-legalize-pinball", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/mc/jwalker/2014_06/tommy.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "When I wrote my \nhistory of game panics&nbsp;earlier this year, many readers\nwere surprised to learn that New York City not only banned pinball\nbut didn't get around to legalizing it until 1976.
