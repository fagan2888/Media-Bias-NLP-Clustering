Among those listening was series star Kerry Washington.\n\n\u201cAll we hear about is phony scandals,\u201d Obama said, pausing ever so briefly to acknowledge his hosts. \u201cNo offense \u2014 \u2018Scandal\u2019 is a great show.\u201d\n\nObama was aiming his irritation at Republicans who he said \u201cdon\u2019t have any interest in making things work.\n\n\u201cSo they obstruct, and they obfuscate and they bamboozle, and they sometimes don\u2019t tell exactly what\u2019s truth \u2014 that was a euphemism,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cMost folks don\u2019t have the time to sort out all the intricacies of Obamacare or Benghazi or this or that,\u201d the president said, naming two issues that Republicans have seized on to question his administration. \u201cThey don\u2019t have time for that. All they know is it\u2019s not working for them.\u201d\n\nObama\u2019s remarks stuck to a theme he has been relying on during a three-day West Coast fundraising spree \u2014 that Republicans are fostering a cynicism in the country that helps the GOP by dissuading the public to voe.\n\nEarlier Wednesday Obama portrayed Republicans as members of a party that \u201chas no agenda other than making government not work.\u201d\n\nObama has combined his irritation at Republicans with calls on GOP leaders to cooperate with him, a call challenged by Republican leaders who say Obama is not sufficiently engaged in legislation and is not pursuing bipartisan solutions.\n\nHouse Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, noted this week that the Republican-controlled House has passed numerous pieces of legislation that he says would boost the economy but have stalled in the Democratic-led Senate.\n\n\u201cIf he\u2019s serious, he\u2019ll help us break the logjam in his party\u2019s Senate and make more progress for Americans still asking, \u2018Where are the jobs?'\u201d Boehner said.\n\nObama\u2019s fundraising \u2014 at least six events over three days in Seattle, San Francisco and Los Angeles \u2014 came during a week that represented the two extremes of his approach to Congress. On Tuesday he signed a rare piece of bipartisan job-training legislation and hailed it as a symbol of cooperation. On Monday he signed an executive order prohibiting federal contractors from discriminating on the base of sexual orientation, the kind of go-it-alone strategy he has made a keystone of his second term.\n\nStill, the lack of compromise has not only halted progress on a comprehensive overhaul of the U.S. immigration system but also raised doubts about legislation to help address an influx of young migrants at the southern border and to fix the nation\u2019s veterans\u2019 health programs.\n\nCongress has until the end of next week to move on various fronts before it begins a month-long recess. By the time lawmakers return in September, the midterm election\u2019s fall campaign will be dominant.\n\nIn Washington, Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell faulted Obama for not being in town while Congress debates vital legislation.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to give him advice about how to allocate his time, but he\u2019s certainly not spending the kind of time with the people he needs to pass legislation and convince people who have a vote, who were sent here to legislate, of the virtues of whatever position he has,\u201d McConnell said.\n\n(\u00a9 Copyright 2014 The Associated Press.
