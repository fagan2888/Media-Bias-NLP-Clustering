She was concerned about having coverage on Jan. 1, after her family\u2019s Blue Cross Blue Shield plan was cancelled for not meeting certain requirements under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nWhile attempting to enroll, Wendt repeatedly ran into a glitch claiming her children were not U.S. citizens (they are) and therefore were ineligible for coverage on the exchange. She was able to secure temporary coverage on Dec. 31, 2013 from Blue Cross Blue Shield that carries a monthly premium of $400, and a $17,000 deductible. This plan is a lot more expensive than the family\u2019s old coverage that had a monthly premium of $260 and a deductible of $5,000.\n\nOne week into the New Year, it seems Wendt has finally cleared the glitch but is still facing sticker shock. She found that because she and her husband are small-business owners\u2014Zach is a real estate agent\u2014and they take certain business deductions, they fall right under 200% of the federal poverty line. This makes them subsidy eligible, and their children Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) eligible.\n\n\u201cIf we want our children on our family plan\u2014whether its two or 10 people\u2014we lose the subsidy,\u201d Wendt says. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing that they are forcing families onto government health-care. It almost feels like an attack on small business owners. This revelation is more frustrating than the initial glitch.\u201d\n\nUnder the ACA, every American must have insurance by the end of open enrollment period on April 1, or they will face a fine of $95 a year or 1% of their annual income, for failing to comply. Nearly six million Americans have lost their old coverage because the plans failed to meet certain requirements under the law, covering 10 comprehensive benefits from ambulatory services to prescription drug benefits.\n\nContinue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT\n\nPaul Howard, director and senior fellow at the Center for Medical Progress at the Manhattan Institute, says it\u2019s unclear if the issue the Wendt family encountered is unintentional, or if it is a mechanism to offset the score of the bill, as CHIP is less expensive than federal subsidies.\n\n\u201cThis matters because a lot of Medicaid and CHIP programs pay physicians less than private insurers and Medicare,\u201d Howard says. \u201cWhen [patients] go to see a specialist, they may wait longer, or not even get to see some of the doctors they want to see. I can\u2019t think of a reason why you wouldn\u2019t give them the subsidy for the parents\u2019 coverage, and then let them buy into the policy [for their kids] and pay out of pocket to do so.\u201d\n\nRegardless of the cost, parents should have the choice, Howard says, adding it\u2019s unclear how many families fall into this scenario.\n\nA spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services says it does not have statistics on how many people would be impacted similarly.\n\nWendt says she will continue to search for a less-expensive plan off of the exchange, to see if it\u2019s possible to lower their current deductible. If not, she says she will stick with her current temporary plan, despite its high deductible.\n\n\u201cThe law isn\u2019t making health-care more affordable, it\u2019s masking a huge price increase,\u201d Wendt says.\n\nAnd the kicker is that the family had insurance, that they liked, before it was cancelled, Howard says.\n\n\u201cWe allow people to buy gold coverage instead of silver coverage,\u201d Howard says. \u201cIf you don\u2019t qualify for subsidies, you can still buy child-only policies on the exchange. There is no reason why you can\u2019t turn to insurers for the same.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.modified": "2016-01-06 11:42:40 EST", "dc.type": "Text.Article", "twitter": {"url": "http://www.foxbusiness.com/features/2014/01/07/moms-obamacare-hits-keep-coming-enroll-kids-in-chip-or-lose-subsidy.html", "image": "http://a57.foxnews.com/images.foxnews.com/content/fox-business/features/2014/01/07/moms-obamacare-hits-keep-coming-enroll-kids-in-chip-or-lose-subsidy/_jcr_content/par/featured-media/media-0.img.jpg/0/0/1452098561843.jpg?ve=1", "description": "A Michigan mom who has been fighting to enroll her family in an insurance plan via Healthcare.gov has hit a new roadblock.
