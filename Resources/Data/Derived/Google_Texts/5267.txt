The Kohl’s department store that caught fire last week is expected to reopen Wednesday morning, company officials said.

The smoky fire, which sent dozens of shoppers and employees into the cold Friday night, caused the department store to shut down for several days. The store is expected to reopen 9 a.m. Wednesday, said company spokeswoman Maggie Lund.

No injuries were reported, but part of the store caused damage to the backrooms of the store, Lund said.

Authorities got the call at 4:38 p.m. Friday and headed to the store, located at 2145 Route 35. It took firefighters 45 minutes to find the source of the fire and extinguish the flames.

Investigators focused on recycled batteries or an electrical problem as the cause, police said.

Monmouth County fire marshal Henry Stryker III said the fire was ruled accidental and that recycled batteries couldn’t be ruled out as a factor.
