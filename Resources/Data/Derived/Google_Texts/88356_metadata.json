A new Agenda 21 threatens our way of life\n\n\n\nBy Tom DeWeese If you had a time machine and could travel back to 1992 as the UN's Earth Summit was underway, and you knew what you know now about Agenda 21, imagine the actions you could take to stop it in its tracks. You wouldn't have to wonder what the NGOs who created it had in mind. You wouldn't have to trust the news media to tell you the details. You would know, just as the NGO's, Nancy Pelosi and all the others openly told you, Agenda 21 is a \"comprehensive blue print\" for the reorganization of human society.They told you then, without hesitation, that Agenda 21 was aimed at destroying free enterprise. That is was a clarion call for humans to live on less. That the Earth could no longer sustain the United States of America. That's what they told us, but so many weren't listening. It took over 15 years to most to finally grasp it. And that was only after it was firmly entrenched in every government agency, every community plan, and every school curriculum. So much so than many now say it is impossible to combat. They whine that it's a done deal.Well, guess what, Agenda 21 is not a done deal and one of the main forces to recognize that fact is the UN itself, along with a mob of NGOs. And because it is not a done deal, they are all planning a new massive gathering to reboot Agenda 21 and force it across the finish line.Over the weekend of September 25\u201327, 2015, at the United Nations Headquarters in New York City (just as in the 1992 UN Earth Summit in Brazil) thousands of delegates, UN diplomats, representatives of Non-governmental Organizations, heads of state and the Pope, will converge to present a new fifteen-year plan entitled \"Transforming Our World: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.\"Just as in 1992, they are openly telling us what the plan includes and how they intend to put it in force. The preamble to the plan says, \"All countries and all stakeholders, acting in collaborative partnership, WILL implement this plan.\" It goes on to say, \"We are determined to take the bold and transformative steps which are urgently needed to shift the world onto a sustainable and resilient path. As we embark on this collective journey, we pledge that no one will be left behind.\"That, my friends, is a direct challenge and a threat to anyone who dares to disagree with the plan or stand in their way. They promise us that they \"WILL\" do it and it will be forced on everyone. Our experience with Agenda 21 over the past 23 years tells us what to expect.Here are the seventeen goals to be presented and what they really mean:. The only answer the plan offers for eliminating poverty is redistribution of wealth. The document calls for \"equal rights to economic resources.\" That means government is claiming an absolute power take away anything that belongs to you to give to whomever it deems more deserving. That is government-sanctioned theft. These are only Band-Aids that solve nothing. Tomorrow those on the bread lines will still need more. The result is more poor. There is not a single idea in these plans to give the poor a way to earn their own wealth so they no longer need government handouts.UN documents go into great detail on controlling food supplies. They detail enforcing \"sustainable farming tactics\" which have been proven to force up the cost of food production while decreasing yield. It is basically the old Soviet practice of farm control that turned the bread basket of the world into mass starvation. The document details the use of government controlled seed and plant banks... \"to ensure access to and fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from the utilization of genetic resources and associated traditional knowledge as internationally agreed.\" In other words, our future food sources will be put into the hands of politically connected bureaucrats who have never been on a farm. Smart.. This means cradle to grave control over how and where we live and what we are permitted to eat. The healthy lives they promote means basically forcing us out of our cars and into walking and riding bikes as we are relocated into controlled high rise apartment buildings sanctioned by government. Obamacare, anyone?We learned a long time ago that lifelong learning is only necessary as a means to continually apply behavior modification practices to assure we maintain the desired attitudes, values and beliefs to live in a global village. Give the children a well-rounded academic knowledge in grade school and they will be able to take care of educating themselves on any new developments that arise in their lives.The rainbow flag flies as we ignore Shariah law and its war on women.. Ask California how sustainable water control is working for them as these policies have torn down water systems and dams to \"free the rivers.\" The original pioneers found the land to be a desert. They built a sophisticated water control system that resulted in an emerald green paradise. Now, as Sustainable policies are being enforced, they are witnessing the return of the desert, destroying productive land. Meanwhile, across the nation, the EPA is moving to take control of all the water in the United States. Control the water, control the population.Seriously? Their solution is to ban oil and enforce wind and solar power. Every study across the nation and around the world has proven that these \"modern\" energy sources are unreliable. They force up the cost of energy and some reports say they are making people sick when forced to live under the wind turbines. Moreover, the carnage of the birds and bats that are being chopped up and fried by these \"sustainable\" energy sources goes against everything environmentalists told us about protecting species.. One thing our 23 years of Agenda 21 have proven, there is no economic growth. Several nations in Europe that really tried to live by the sustainable guidelines on energy and water controls are now dumping those programs as fast as they can to save their economies. And who decides what is \"productive\" or \"decent\" work? Do we leave it to the bureaucrats to decide?Oh come now. Sustainable industrialization means destroyed industry. No real industry can remain in business under a government managed economy with its shifting rules and constant increase in taxes. Government doesn't create industry or prosperity. Our government's real job is to provide protection of the market place so real innovators are free to create new ideas, industries and opportunities. Government itself is a job killer when it gets in the way.This is another form of redistribution of wealth that forces industries from first world to third world nations. This is done by using oppressive sustainable policies to drive up production costs, forcing companies to take their factories to the poorer nations. The second trick is to exempt those poorer nations from the very environmental rules and regulations that caused the factories to move in the first place. Can anyone explain how this helps the environment? It doesn't. It simply makes everyone equally poor. This is also an assault on national sovereignty.This is Smart Growth which promises a utopia of families and neighbors playing and working together, riding bikes, walking to work in stress free communities. It really means the end of private property rights, single family homes, and stack and pack high rises where residents are over taxed, over regulated, rents are high and individual thoughts and actions are viewed as a threat to the \"well-ordered society.\" And by the way, the American Planning Association did a study to see if their smart growth plans worked and their own report concluded that Smart Growth doesn't work.What more is there to say? Control from the top down.Here it is! The root of the entire plan. Climate Change. How many scientific reports do real scientists have to present to show this is the greatest scam ever devised to create a reason for government to control every aspect of our lives? Well, here, let the Global Warming scare mongers tell you their true purpose in their own words:.\" Christine Stewart (former Canadian Minister of the Environment). Justice built on a lie? And here is another quote to make it clear.Timothy Wirth (President, UN Foundation). The end justifies the means!. Control the water, control society. This one is really aimed at destroying the oil industry in order to enforce wind and solar power. This is the UN pounding its chest to become the central global government it has always sought to be. It has no more right to the seas than it does to the air we breath or the surface of the moon.Have you been watching the news as the greatest fires in history are destroying millions of acres of forests? Why is this happening? Because of sustainable forest management that refuses to allow the removal of dead trees from the forest floor. This creates as much of ten feet of kindling that makes massively hot and unmanageable fires. That kindling is so thick that even small animals have a hard time getting through. If you want to save a forest, send an environmentalist back to his high rise in New York City where he belongs.This is Social Justice which really means social engineering. Have you ever once witnessed an \"effective\" or \"accountable\" institution coming out of the United Nations? By its very nature, the UN is unaccountable. Who would be the entity to oversee that accountability? Every one of these programs outlined in the 2030 Agenda creates money, power and unaccountability at every level of government. That is why government is now running out of control and people are feeling so hopeless in trying to deal with their governments. Goal 16 should be named the \"Foxes Running the Hen House\" goal.This means the re-boot of Agenda 21, because that was the original \"global partnership.\" This goal is a call for all of the treaties, plans and schemes devised in the massive UN meetings to be made the law of the globe. It is total global government and it is a sure highway to misery, destruction of human society, individual thought, motivation and dreams.In 1992 they told us that Agenda 21 was just a suggestion. Today, after experiencing the \"wrenching transformation\" of our society that Al Gore called for, we know it was much more than that. And we have suffered the consequences as our economy has plummeted, as the middle class is disappearing, jobs are now existent and the world is in turmoil.Now the power elite which prey on the poor and helpless are determined to finish the job. They are fast moving toward the goal of eliminating individual nation states; controlling individual actions and wiping private property ownership from the face of the Earth. Their goal is to make us all \"equal\" in the same chains to assure none of us can disrupt their well ordered utopian nightmare.Well, now our time machine has brought us back from 1992 to the present. As we disembark, one voice should be ringing in our ears loud and clear from the 1992 Earth Summit. In a clear and concise voice he warned us of what Agenda 21 was designed to do. He said,And remember, that wasn't said by just an interested bystander. It was from the official statement of the Chairman of the Earth Summit, Maurice Strong.So now, we are back in good old 2015 as the same forces are about to introduce the 2030 Agenda. We now have the advantage of knowing full well what it is and its intended affect on our lives. They have told us clearly, right in its title: \"Transform the World.\"The 2030 Agenda is to be built on the ruins and desolation of a thousand such schemes for control over human life. Each time they have failed and each time they have come back with a new \"plan.\" The 2030 Agenda is Agenda 21 re-booted. But this time you and I don't have an excuse to ignore it. We know what it is from the start. Now we have a new opportunity and the obligation to stop it dead in its tracks.\u00a9 Tom DeWeese", "article_metadata": {"description": "If you had a time machine and could travel back to 1992 as the UN's Earth Summit was underway, and you knew what you know now about Agenda 21, imagine the actions you could take to stop it in its tracks.
