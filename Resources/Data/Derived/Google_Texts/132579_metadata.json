After hearing a loud crack we were worried he broke his ankle, so we hurried him to an emergency room.\n\nWe took him to Connecticut Children\u2019s Medical Center, where he received excellent care. Fortunately, it was just a sprain.\n\nA couple of months later we got the bill. We have a high deductible health plan with a health savings account (HSA), so we now see \u2014 and pay \u2014 most of our health care costs directly.\n\nThe emergency room visit was over $1,600, including the X-rays. After an insurance adjustment, we ended up paying almost $1,200.\n\nWhile emergency room visits are notoriously expensive, I still experienced sticker shock.\n\nBut maybe that isn\u2019t such a bad thing?\n\nMost of these health plans require you to pay health providers several thousand dollars, money you can save tax free in an HSA, before the insurance kicks in. They are also substantially less expensive than other health plans, so theoretically a consumer can use the difference in price to save some money in their HSA.\n\nSome of the benefits of high deductible plans include greater transparency, and there\u2019s a self-rationing effect \u2014 you don\u2019t go to the doctor unless you really feel like you need to. Studies, including one done by the National Bureau of Economic Research, show that these kinds of health plans lead to reduced health care spending. The NBER study showed a 15-percent reduction in spending.\n\n\n\nCritics say the plans shift too much of the cost of health care onto the consumer, who may then avoid getting necessary medical care. This argument troubles me \u2014 because it assumes that a person does not know what\u2019s best for him or herself. There is some risk that the people who choose high deductible plans can\u2019t afford to put money in an HSA \u2014 but then, they probably can\u2019t afford more costly health insurance either. What a high deductible plan does give them is a cushion in case of catastrophic circumstances.\n\nAnd placing the responsibility on a consumer should lead them to making smarter choices \u2014 like, \u201cI only have a cold, there\u2019s probably nothing the doctor can do, so I\u2019m going to stay home.\u201d Or, \u201cMy ears are killing me, so I better go to the doctor to see if I have an ear infection.\u201d\n\nAlongside the growth in high deductible plans, there is also a growth in cheaper more accessible health care. For example \u201cMinute Clinics\u201d have sprung up in CVS stores across the nation, where you can see a doctor quickly and usually for less than $100 a visit. Telemedicine is another example of a health care innovation that is making it cheaper and easier to see a doctor for a routine problem.\n\nBecause high deductible plans also offer a lot of consumer choice \u2014 typically you don\u2019t have to get a referral to see a specialist \u2014 the flexibility appeals to people who want to see specific doctors.\n\nThere is some discipline involved if you have a high deductible plan. You need to be smart about saving money every month in your HSA, but the point of a high deductible plan is to cover you when you have larger health problems that you can\u2019t afford to pay for yourself.\n\nAs columnists in the Wall Street Journal put it recently, this kind of insurance \u201crestores the fundamental purpose of health insurance: to reduce the financial risk of large and unanticipated medical expenses.\u201d\n\nThe acceleration of the use of these plans is a natural byproduct of the Affordable Care Act (ACA or \u201cObamacare\u201d). When insurance costs increased after the passage of the ACA, many employers started offering high deductible plans, first as a less expensive option, then \u2014 for many \u2014 the only option.\n\nBut the increased use of high deductible plans also shines a spotlight on a problem in health care: The price of health care is still largely a mystery.\n\nYou can ask hospitals for their \u201cchargemaster,\u201d basically their price list. Steven Brill somewhat famously did this for a Time magazine cover story that ran 26,000 words. (Well worth the read, just set aside a good chunk of time.)\n\nBrill compared chargemasters from hospitals in Bridgeport and Stamford and found substantial differences in price for the same procedures.\n\nWe don\u2019t talk much about the cost of health care. Most of us don\u2019t understand how hospitals come up with their prices \u2014 and it turns out they don\u2019t necessarily understand that either.\n\nA hospital CEO at the University of Utah recently started a project to determine what the goods and services provided by her hospital actually cost \u2014 and this was considered a radical move.\n\nPrices vary dramatically from one health care provider to the next \u2014 but there is little way to know this.\n\nA friend of mine \u2014 I\u2019ll call him Jim \u2014 ran into this problem when his son broke his arm. On the advice of his health insurance provider, Jim took his son for a follow-up visit to see a doctor at Connecticut Children\u2019s (I\u2019m not trying to pick on them, it\u2019s just where he ended up). When he received the bill he called around to other doctors and realized he could have paid much less if he had gone to a different provider.\n\nWhen Jim contacted his insurance company about this and asked them to provide a list of negotiated rates for health providers in his area, he was told they would give him the rates but first he needed to get the Tax ID number of the providers, and the medical code for the procedure. He contacted the health care provider and asked them for the information, but, he said:\n\n\u201cI was told that they couldn\u2019t give me the codes before any service because assigning codes was a lengthy process requiring a coding specialist. I then asked them for their Tax ID number which they refused to provide and I was then informed that many providers can have more than 20 different Tax ID numbers. So, although it may be technically possible to shop around before receiving a medical service, the inability to get coding information or Tax ID information from the providers make this practically impossible.\u201d\n\nIn response to complaints like these, insurers and states have started to develop tools for consumers to see the cost of health care, but at this point they are neither widely accessible nor very accurate.\n\nThese are issues the state is going to have to confront since many of the enrollees on the state\u2019s health care exchange are on high deductible plans.\n\nPeople unfamiliar with how these plans work have contacted the state\u2019s Insurance Department, according to Gerard O\u2019Sullivan, director of the department\u2019s consumer affairs unit, but not necessarily to complain about prices. I spoke with him and Kathy Walsh, principal examiner for consumer affairs, earlier this week.\n\nWhile their department doesn\u2019t deal with the cost of health care, they do hear from people who have problems with their insurance companies.\n\nThe department has received calls from consumers who are confused when they get bills for medical services, since they assumed that because they had health insurance, those costs would be covered.\n\nGiven all the new buyers in the market who are unfamiliar with how deductibles work, people have been confused about what their financial responsibilities are, said Walsh.\n\nHopefully this will change over time, as more people choose high deductible plans because of their cost, and as more employers switch to the plans for the same reason. It\u2019s also likely that eventually these plans will become the norm for public sector employees as well \u2014 many public employers, from the town level on up, are starting to offer these plans to their employees.\n\nThe health care market is still an absolute mess in this country, and the ACA has done little to change that. Not that everything in the ACA is bad\u2014I\u2019m glad, for instance, that people who were once uninsurable because of pre-existing conditions can now get health care. But, while the ACA increased access to health insurance, it did nothing to address cost, and the roll out was an absolute mess. While it hasn\u2019t been as bad in Connecticut, many people across the country have faced a bureaucratic nightmare in trying to get and keep their coverage.\n\nThe health care community \u2014 not the government \u2014 needs to find ways to make health care more affordable and easier to access and understand. Greater transparency and greater consumer engagement might be just the right prescription to change things for the better.\n\nSuzanne Bates is the policy director for the Yankee Institute for Public Policy.
