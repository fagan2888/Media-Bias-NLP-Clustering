Rand Paul says the Affordable Care Act\u2019s Medicaid expansion may \u201cbankrupt\u201d rural hospitals in Kentucky. But state health care leaders say its hospitals stand to benefit, since the expansion would provide insurance to those who otherwise wouldn\u2019t be able to pay their hospital bills.\n\nPaul, a Kentucky Republican who has introduced legislation that would repeal the Medicaid expansion, made his remarks on \u201cThis Week\u201d when host George Stephanopoulos asked about the successful launch of the state health care exchange. The Kentucky website, kynect, had none of the problems plaguing the federal exchange. The state exchange had signed up 32,485 people in the first month of operation \u2014 about 5 percent of the state\u2019s 640,000 uninsured residents.\n\nStephanopoulos, Nov. 3: What do you make of that fact that so many Kentuckians are signing up? And does that tell you that this program can be a success? Paul: Well, nearly 90 percent of them are signing up for Medicaid, free health insurance from the government. My concern is not that we shouldn\u2019t help people. I do want to help these people to get insurance. But there is going to be a cost. And in my state, we have a lot of rural hospitals that teeter in the balance. My fear is that these hospitals may be bankrupt by overwhelming them with Medicaid patients.\n\nWe asked Paul\u2019s office about the senator\u2019s concerns about the impact of the Medicaid expansion on rural hospitals, but we received no response.\n\nThe state\u2019s health care officials, however, have uniformly supported Medicaid expansion in part because it is expected to financially help, not hurt, state hospitals \u2014 particularly because the law also gradually reduces federal funding to hospitals for uncompensated care.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act cuts the federal Medicaid Disproportionate Share Hospital (DSH) program by $18.1 billion over seven years, beginning in fiscal year 2014, to help pay for the cost of expanding Medicaid. The cuts were predicated on the assumption that all states would expand Medicaid, but the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in June 2012 that states could opt-out of the expansion. That meant that states could decide not to expand Medicaid and, so far, only half of the 50 states have agreed to the expansion.\n\nShortly after the Supreme Court ruling, Foundation for a Healthy Kentucky President/CEO Susan Zepeda wrote a blog post urging Kentucky state officials to expand Medicaid. She wrote that not expanding Medicaid would financially hurt hospitals in the state.\n\nZepeda, July 31, 2012: [O]ther pieces of the law were developed with the assumption that all states would expand Medicaid coverage. Because of this assumption, cuts to other federal health funding are built into the continuing roll out of the Affordable Care law: For example, nationally Disproportionate Share Hospital (DSH) funding has provided an average of 95% of uncompensated care costs for state-owned hospitals; 69% of uncompensated care for local public hospitals; and 38% of uncompensated care for private hospitals. The law will reduce DSH funding by $14 billion over 10 years (starting in 2014). This funding decrease to key providers was supposed to be offset by the increase in Medicaid coverage, as the number of uninsured individuals seen at hospitals would drop significantly under the Medicaid expansion. If Kentucky opts out of the Medicaid expansion, however, state, local, and private hospitals could be faced with sharp increases in uncompensated care (care provided but not paid).\n\nMichael Rust, past president of the Kentucky Hospital Association, agreed. He told the news website Business First in February that the state\u2019s hospitals provided $718 million worth of uncompensated care in 2009. In a Q&A with Rust, Business First wrote that \u201cthe Kentucky Hospital Association supports universal insurance coverage, be it through Medicaid or other means. And expanding Medicaid is step toward that.\u201d\n\nBusiness First, Feb. 26: Question: What would it mean for Kentucky hospitals if Medicaid were to be expanded? \u201cIt just provides another source of coverage,\u201d which is important because hospitals care for patients who can\u2019t afford to pay, he said. \u201cThey\u2019re good people, and they try to make payment but just can\u2019t,\u201d he said. The total cost of uncompensated care in all Kentucky hospitals was $718 million during 2009, he said, the most recent year that data was available. Question: Have you worked with the state, communicating what expansion could mean for providers? \u201cWe work very closely with the state,\u201d Rust said, noting that the Kentucky Cabinet for Health and Family Services has been receptive to the issue. \u201cOur main bullet point is we do support universal coverage, everyone should have coverage.\u201d\n\nMost of Kentucky\u2019s hospitals are located in rural areas. In 2007, 75 of Kentucky\u2019s 123 hospitals were in rural areas, according to a 2009 Kentucky Hospital Association report.\n\nThe Kentucky Cabinet for Health and Family Services issued a 29-page report that recommended expanding Medicaid in part because \u201cour hospitals will suffer\u201d without the expansion. The report estimates that the state\u2019s hospitals will see a cut in DSH payments of about $287.5 million over eight years, beginning in fiscal year 2014 through fiscal 2021. It said, \u201c[S]tates that do not implement the Medicaid expansion risk losing substantial resources that will be needed by hospitals that serve large numbers of low income, uninsured patients, without the intended reduction in the number of uninsured in the state.\u201d\n\nGov. Steve Beshear, a Democrat, accepted the report\u2019s recommendation and issued an executive order in May to expand Medicaid.\n\nUnder the Affordable Care Act, states may expand Medicaid coverage to residents with incomes up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level, which is $15,856 for individuals and $32,499 for a family of four. The state estimates that an additional 308,000 Kentuckians will be eligible for the joint federal-state medical program, beginning Jan. 1.\n\nThe Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the Urban Institute issued a report in March that assessed the impact of Medicaid expansion on hospitals nationwide. That report said opponents of the Affordable Care Act have made the argument that \u201chospitals will not gain from Medicaid expansion, since it undermines more generously reimbursed private coverage.\u201d But the report found that \u201cfor each dollar in private revenue that a Medicaid expansion eliminates, hospitals\u2019 Medicaid revenue rises by $2.59.\u201d\n\nIts conclusion: Medicaid expansion \u201cgreatly favors hospitals.\u201d\n\nRobert Wood Johnson Foundation and Urban Institute, March 2013: Put simply, a Medicaid expansion increases the number of patients for whom hospitals are paid, but some patients shift from private to more poorly reimbursed public coverage. The net result of these two factors greatly favors hospitals. Altogether, for each dollar in private revenue that a Medicaid expansion eliminates, hospitals\u2019 Medicaid revenue rises by $2.59. \u2026 Whether the ACA creates net economic pain or gain for hospitals will depend significantly on whether states add Medicaid expansion to the remainder of the federal legislation.\n\nThat\u2019s not to say there are no concerns in Kentucky about expanding Medicaid.\n\nKentucky already does not have enough medical providers to serve its population. In an August 2012 report, the Foundation for a Healthy Kentucky said that in 2008 \u201c80 of Kentucky\u2019s 120 counties were designated as Health Professional Shortage Areas (HPSAs) by the Health Resources and Services Administration\u2019s (HRSA) Bureau of Primary Care.\u201d\n\nKentucky Auditor Adam Edelen said the shortage has been exacerbated by the state\u2019s new Medicaid Managed Care system, which took effect in November 2011. Edelen issued a report in July that found an 8 percent decline in Medicaid providers.\n\n\u201cOverall, the reduction in the number of providers under the managed care program is troubling, especially in light of the more than 300,000 new Medicaid members estimated to join the program when the Commonwealth implements the Medicaid expansion portion of the Affordable Care Act (ACA),\u201d the report said.\n\nThe auditor\u2019s report also said the Medicaid Managed Care system has caused a cash-flow problem for rural hospitals in particular. Edelen blamed a \u201cquick transition\u201d to the new system, delays and errors in processing claim payments, and additional reporting requirements.\n\n\u201cI am concerned about the long-term viability of some of our rural hospitals and in turn, even more worried about access to health care by all rural Kentuckians,\u201d Edelen said in a press release.\n\nIn an email, Zepeda of the Foundation for a Healthy Kentucky said her organization \u201cremains very concerned about the capacity of KY\u2019s existing health care system \u2014 particularly in rural areas \u2014 to cost effectively care for a much larger number of patients.\u201d She said that\u2019s why her organization is funding \u201cdemonstration projects around ways to \u2018do care differently,\u2019 \u201d such as \u201credesign care delivery to include telemedicine, nurse-managed clinics, community care workers, etc.\u201d\n\nThe foundation is an independent charitable organization funded as part of a court-approved agreement that resulted from a state investigation into the merger of Anthem Inc. and Blue Cross & Blue Shield. It launched in 2000 to \u201caddress the unmet health care needs of Kentuckians.\u201d\n\nIn an interview, Zepeda also told us that the cash-flow problems caused by a rapid and rocky transition to Medicaid Managed Care are being addressed. Stephenie Hoelscher, a spokeswoman for the auditor, agreed.\n\n\u201cProgress has been made and continues to be made in easing the cash-flow burdens of rural hospitals, but I don\u2019t think these hospitals would say the problems have been sufficiently addressed at this point,\u201d Hoelscher said.\n\nOn balance, Zepeda said her organization still believes the state\u2019s residents and hospitals will benefit from the expansion.\n\n\u201cThe opportunity to insure a large proportion of presently uninsured Kentuckians who seek medical services is likely to have a positive effect both on their own health (by seeking more timely care, when the illness or injury they present is more likely to be healed effectively and at a lower cost) and on the health of institutions and providers from which/whom they seek care (who presently provide them with some level of uncompensated care),\u201d Zepeda said in her email to us.\n\nOne footnote: Paul also said that nearly 90 percent of those who have signed up on the state exchange so far have enrolled in Medicaid. That was true as of Nov. 1. The state reported that 27,854 of the 32,485 people who enrolled on the state exchange enrolled in Medicaid. But the state also reported that an additional 13,900 Kentuckians who went on the state exchange were found to be eligible for government subsidies to purchase private insurance, although they have yet to enroll. Ultimately, the state said, about half of the state\u2019s 640,000 uninsured residents will enroll in private plans.\n\n\u2014 Eugene Kiely", "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "Altogether, for each dollar in private revenue that a Medicaid expansion eliminates, hospitals\u2019 Medicaid revenue rises by $2.59.\nSen.
