Burwell lawsuit. It remains a secret until the court hands down its opinion in June.\n\nThe plaintiffs are four Virginia residents who have challenged the provision in the Affordable Care Act (ACA) that authorizes the Department of Health and Human Services to establish a Federal Health Care Insurance Exchange as a fallback for states that elected not to establish state exchanges.\n\nIf they prevail, an estimated 9 million Americans in 34 states that did not set up exchanges\u2014in most cases because their governments objected to the ACA itself\u2014lose the federal subsidies that make insurance coverage purchased on the federal exchange affordable.\n\nThe litigation\u2019s perverse contradictions begin with the plaintiffs. To get standing to sue, their incomes had to be low enough to qualify for IRS tax subsidies provided through the ACA. Although they qualify, they do not want subsidies. Refusing subsidies, they claim they are illegally \u201ccoerced\u201d into paying a small ($95) tax penalty for not buying insurance they cannot afford without subsidies.\n\nAgain, perverse.\n\nIf they prevail, more than 319,000 of their fellow Virginians will lose subsidies they currently receive. Absent the subsidies, they will probably be unable to afford health care coverage.\n\nAnother perverse contradiction. There is no state exchange in Virginia, because the GOP majority in the General Assembly refused to establish one, leaving those 319,000 Virginians to purchase health care coverage on the federal exchange. One logical resolution to the impending insurance crisis would be to allow voters in Virginia\u2014and in the other states that have refused to set up exchanges\u2014to go to the ballot box and oust the legislators who rejected a state exchange.\n\nBut the crisis is not political. It is actuarial. It is immediate. And it is much larger than Virginia.\n\n\u201c[A ruling for the plaintiffs] precipitates the insurance market death spirals that the statutory findings specifically say the statute was designed to avoid,\u201d said Justice Sonia Sotomayor during oral arguments.\n\nThe \u201cdeath spiral\u201d begins with the mass cancellation of subsidized policies that will follow a ruling against the federal exchange. Only the sickest individuals, who dare not risk going uncovered, will remain insured. The departure of healthy individuals will drive premiums higher, which will encourage more and more people to pay the tax penalty rather than pay soaring insurance premiums.", "article_metadata": {"description": "\"Intellectual\" justice thinks Congress will fix ACA.
