Apparently, they all thought it was joke until this weekend or something. And the big takeaway is best exemplified by this observation by Nicholos Kristof in the New York Times:\n\nMedia elites rightly talk about our insufficient racial, ethnic and gender diversity, but we also lack economic diversity. We inhabit a middle-class world and don\u2019t adequately cover the part of America that is struggling and seething. We spend too much time talking to Senators, not enough to the jobless.\n\nIt mystifying why Kristof thinks media elites inhabit a \u201cmiddle class\u201d world, but that\u2019s beside the point. It\u2019s the rest that\u2019s truly laughable.\n\nEvidently, Kristof believes that if you\u2019re talking about racial, ethnic and gender diversity you aren\u2019t talking about the jobless or the part of America that is struggling. Basically, he\u2019s saying the media\u2019s ignoring white men. Again.\n\nThis conversation has been going on since the 1960s. Here\u2019s the Kristof of his day, Joseph Kraft, wringing his hands over the media elite failing to properly take into consideration the needs and concerns of \u201caverage Americans\u201d back in 1968 after the violence at the Democratic convention:\n\n\u201cAre we merely neutral observers, seekers after truth in the public interest? Or do we, as the supporters of Mayor Daley and his Chicago police have charged, have a prejudice of our own? \u201cThe answer, I think is that Mayor Daley and his supporters have a point. Most of us in what is called the communications field are not rooted in the great mass of ordinary Americans\u2013in Middle America. And the results show up not merely in occasional episodes such as the Chicago violence but more importantly in the systematic bias toward young people, minority groups, and the of presidential candidates who appeal to them. \u201cTo get a feel of this bias it is first necessary to understand the antagonism that divides the middle class of this country. On the one hand there are highly educated upper-income whites sure of and brimming with ideas for doing things differently. On the other hand, there is Middle America, the large majority of low-income whites, traditional in their values and on the defensive against innovation. \u201cThe most important organs of and television are, beyond much doubt, dominated by the outlook of the upper-income whites. \u201cIn these circumstances, it seems to me that those of us in the media need to make a special effort to understand Middle America. Equally it seems wise to exercise a certain caution, a prudent restraint, in pressing a claim for a plenary indulgence to be in all places at all times the agent of the sovereign public.\u201d\n\nThis began the decades-long self-flagellation by the media (and the cynical exploitation of it by the Republicans) wherein it was assumed that the most misunderstood and underserved people in the whole country were salt-of-the-earth white folks nobody ever thinks about. Except that it\u2019s anything but the truth. Every single election cycle since 1968 the press has been obsessed with this mythical Real American who is always angry, always frustrated, always railing against the so-called elites because they allegedly only care about the racial minorities or the women or somebody other than them. Then we end up with a mass soul search in which we all come to understand that the key to the election is to address these people\u2019s grievances.\n\nIn those early days it was referred to as \u201cThe Silent Majority\u201d of Richard Nixon, which Donald Trump has unoriginally revived. Since then, pollsters have come up with slogans to target certain demographics (NASCAR Dads and Waitress Moms are two examples), which the press then uses as symbols of this Real America, representing the breathing heart and soul of the country.\n\n1976 featured media obsessing over the everyman outsider Jimmy Carter, a born-again Christian from the South who spoke to Real Americans who just wanted a president who wouldn\u2019t lie to them. It wasn\u2019t long before they discovered that he didn\u2019t really fit the bill. The Real Americans, it turned out, were more conservative than Carter and really wanted the Gipper to Make America Great Again. And thus the most Real Americans in the whole country were discovered: the Reagan Democrat:", "article_metadata": {"description": "Members of the establishment press wonder how they got Trump so wrong.
