Forecasts show an over 70 percent chance of the weather pattern developing in 2014, which would itself increase the odds of extreme weather events (think droughts, floods and typhoons) occurring across the globe. Here\u2019s what you need to know:\n\nEl what-o?\n\nEl Ni\u00f1o is a fancy/Spanish name for a complex weather pattern rooted in the tropical Pacific Ocean. The NOAA describes it as \u201ca disruption of the ocean-atmosphere system \u2026 having important consequences for weather and climate around the globe.\u201d The last really strong one (it broke records) happened from 1997 to 1998. In the U.S., it was associated with flooding in the Southeast and California, an ice storm in the Northeast and tornadoes in Florida. Experts say this new event, if it ends up happening, could give that one a run for its money.\n\nWhat\u2019s it look like?\n\nThis image, from the Australian Bureau of Meteorology, shows the massive amount of unusually warm water building up in the Pacific. Water below the surface is currently more than 7.2 degrees Fahrenheit above average:\n\n\u201cAlthough the El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is currently neutral, surface and subsurface ocean temperatures have warmed considerably in recent weeks, consistent with a state of rapid transition,\u201d the bureau said. In the upcoming winter (May through July in the Southern Hemipshere), models predict those temperatures could rise to El Ni\u00f1o levels.\n\nThat\u2019s cool, but what\u2019s it look like? As in, how\u2019s it going to affect me?\n\nThat depends on where you live. Here\u2019s Andrew Freedman, at Mashable:\n\nIn Australia, El Ni\u00f1o events often lead to below average rainfall during the second half of the year, sometimes resulting in widespread droughts. In the U.S., El Ni\u00f1o events tend to have their biggest influence on winter weather, bringing wetter conditions to the West and Southern tier of the country. This would be potentially good news to drought-stricken areas like California and Texas, although there is no guarantee that an El Ni\u00f1o would break the drought conditions.\n\nAt Slate, Eric Holthaus gets more specific:\n\nA severe drought continues to rage in and around Indonesia, which an El Ni\u00f1o would likely worsen. Peru\u2019s anchovy catch may be significantly affected should a strong El Ni\u00f1o materialize. Australia\u2019s ongoing battles with bush fires may be intensified once its dry season resumes later this year. But perhaps the strangest impact so far has been in India, where monsoon forecasting is at the heart of national politics. The meteorology department there has accused U.S. weather forecasters of \u201cspreading rumors\u201d and colluding to ruin the Indian stock market by forecasting a return of El Ni\u00f1o.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A whole lot of crazy weather could be coming our way", "title": "Why an El Ni\u00f1o is this year\u2019s extreme weather event to look out for", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "A whole lot of crazy weather could be coming our way", "title": "Why an El Ni\u00f1o is this year\u2019s extreme weather event to look out for", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/04/09/why_el_nino_is_this_years_extreme_weather_event_to_look_out_for/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/03/el-nino.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A whole lot of crazy weather could be coming our way", "title": "Why an El Ni\u00f1o is this year\u2019s extreme weather event to look out for", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/03/el-nino.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@readingirl", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Lindsay Abrams", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, California Drought, Climate Change, El Nino, Extreme weather, Floods, Global Warming, oceans, Pacific Ocean, warming oceans", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdbef1\"", "article_summary": "El Ni\u00f1o is a fancy/Spanish name for a complex weather pattern rooted in the tropical Pacific Ocean.\nHere\u2019s Andrew Freedman, at Mashable:In Australia, El Ni\u00f1o events often lead to below average rainfall during the second half of the year, sometimes resulting in widespread droughts.\nTopics: California Drought, Climate Change, El Nino, Extreme weather, Floods, Global Warming, oceans, Pacific Ocean, warming oceans, Sustainability NewsAn El Ni\u00f1o may be brewing in the Southern Hemisphere, the Australian Bureau of Meteorology reported Tuesday.\nPeru\u2019s anchovy catch may be significantly affected should a strong El Ni\u00f1o materialize.\nForecasts show an over 70 percent chance of the weather pattern developing in 2014, which would itself increase the odds of extreme weather events (think droughts, floods and typhoons) occurring across the globe."}
