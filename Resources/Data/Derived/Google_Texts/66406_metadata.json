But the evening news shows have refused to talk about it.\n\nSix years ago, Tax Freedom Day fell on April 12, five days before tax day. In 2016, Tax Freedom Day isn\u2019t until April 24; an astonishing 12 days later than in 2011, thanks to tax hikes including Obamacare.\n\nDespite the fact that Tax Freedom Day has moved almost two weeks later into the year, the evening news shows on ABC, NBC, and CBS never covered it between April 5, 2011, and April 13, 2016. It\u2019s as if the information didn\u2019t exist -- except that The Tax Foundation has released a report on Tax Freedom Day since 2006. They also retroactively calculated Tax Freedom Day going back to 1900.\n\nPete Sepp, the president of The National Taxpayers Union, finds the media blackout inexcusable.\n\n\u201cMany Americans sense that their tax burdens are creeping upward and the major media have a duty to explore that phenomenon,\u201d Sepp told the Media Research Center in an email.\n\n\u201cIf in the process [the major media] want to have a debate over the data that goes into calculating Tax Freedom Day, so be it. The measurement is entirely defensible. But silence should not be an option,\u201d Sepp continued.\n\nAccording to Sepp, though some people may argue that Tax Freedom Day\u2019s forward shift is because of an improving economy rather than outright tax hikes, that just demonstrates the \u201cconfiscatory nature\u201d of taxes. \u201cThe faster people make money the faster the government takes it,\u201d Sepp declared.\n\nSince at least 1997, the news networks have negatively covered tax cuts while simultaneously defending tax increases. The media also gave the IRS a pass when they were caught targeting conservative groups in 2014. When Obamacare came into effect, it created or hiked 13 separate taxes, but the networks ignored them in 87 percent of news stories between Nov. 17, 2014 and Feb. 17, 2015.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "NewsBusters", "description": "With the federal tax deadline moved to April 18 this year, people have an extra three days to procrastinate on their 2015 returns.
