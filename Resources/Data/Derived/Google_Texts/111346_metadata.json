(WTHI) \u2013 Union Hospital and health systems leaders elaborate on why the decision was made to cut 150 jobs. News 10 first brought word of the job cuts last week.\n\nThe CEO\u2019s of Union Hospital, Union Health Services and the UAP Clinic all said this is the toughest decision they\u2019ve ever had to make. But they say changes in the world of providing health care have forced their hand.\n\nAt Wednesday\u2019s news conference, Union Health System leaders told News 10 while some of the 150 job cuts have already been made, the process is still ongoing, and more cuts will be coming. They must be made by year\u2019s end. In addition, we can confirm most of the cuts within the Union Health System are in support staff.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve absolutely tried not to do with anybody that has bedside contact with patients,\u201d said Dr. John Bolinger, Union Hospital\u2019s Chief Medical Officer.\n\nLike all hospitals, the Union Health System is seeing more outpatient procedures. This results in shorter overnight stays at the hospital, if any at all. That means less revenue for the hospital. Hospital CEO Steve Holman says he expects the trend to continue. Declining reimbursements also have a hand in this. Holman was asked if the affordable care act played a role in the layoffs.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a significant impact,\u201d said Holman. \u201cSequester was certainly one where we\u2019ve seen significant revenue reductions from, but also from the Affordable Care Act we have seen through the governmental, reductions in Medicare and Medicaid.\u201d\n\nHolman said this was a very difficult decision for these leaders. He also said the cuts will not have any adverse affects on patient care. He says Union Hospital will still work to give patients high quality health care at the lowest possible cost.\n\nDr. Bolinger also said these cuts will not hurt recruiting nurses or doctors to the hospital. He also says it will not derail Union\u2019s plans to become a level three trauma center.", "article_metadata": {"Description": "Leading the Way in Terre Haute and the Wabash Valley with the most accurate and reliable news, weather, and sports coverage, along with the latest breaking news and severe weather coverage.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.linmedia.newstouch.wthi", "og": {"site_name": "WTHITV.com", "description": "By the end of the year, Union Hospital will be cutting a total of 150 jobs.", "title": "Union Hospital cuts described as \u2018support staff\u2019", "url": "http://wthitv.com/2014/07/23/union-hospital-cuts-described-as-support-staff/", "image": {"width": 660, "identifier": "https://lintvwthi.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/ab2921f91ed9496d862c1fe59d7f3ca5.jpg?w=1200", "height": 371}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "Twitter": {"Title": "Union Hospital cuts described as \u2018support staff\u2019", "description": "By the end of the year, Union Hospital will be cutting a total of 150 jobs.", "Card": "Summary_large_image", "Site": "@WTHITV"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "The Wabash Valley's News, Weather and Sports Leader", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=488538858", "fb": {"pages": 65409576342}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "application-name": "WTHITV.com", "google-site-verification": "5iOjTv9548kzHLo52jADaRfomdhZUDVLeei2c-gzjdI", "msvalidate.01": "25404283363C09DE121A55A903F03873", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/WTHITV", "published_time": "2014-07-23T16:42:42+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-07-23T23:42:38+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "By the end of the year, Union Hospital will be cutting a total of 150 jobs.", "creator": "@wthitv", "image": {"src": "https://lintvwthi.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/ab2921f91ed9496d862c1fe59d7f3ca5.jpg?w=640"}, "title": "Union Hospital cuts described as \u2018support staff\u2019", "site": "wthitv", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://wthitv.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/e396a450a3f32b43fa03fd4ba702dccf?s=16", "description": "By the end of the year, Union Hospital will be cutting a total of 150 jobs."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde3cb\"", "article_summary": "The CEO\u2019s of Union Hospital, Union Health Services and the UAP Clinic all said this is the toughest decision they\u2019ve ever had to make.\nIn addition, we can confirm most of the cuts within the Union Health System are in support staff.\nHe says Union Hospital will still work to give patients high quality health care at the lowest possible cost.\n(WTHI) \u2013 Union Hospital and health systems leaders elaborate on why the decision was made to cut 150 jobs.\nLike all hospitals, the Union Health System is seeing more outpatient procedures."}
