One woman raised concerns about police efforts in Milwaukee's black neighborhoods in the name of the war on drugs. Clinton said her mother would try to change some laws.\n\n\"My mom has said we need to, at the federal level, decriminalize the possession of a small amount of marijuana for personal use and apply that retroactively, (and) do the same with reforming or getting rid of three strike laws or minimum sentencing laws,\" said Clinton, adding that hopefully, state and local governments would follow suit.\n\nShe also spoke of improving education and mental health care for African-Americans.\n\nClinton made stops Tuesday to meet with supporters in Waukesha and Madison as well.\n\nEarlier this week, Jane Sanders, wife of Hillary Clinton's Democratic rival, U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, told Wisconsin Public Radio that her husband's positions on issues like raising the minimum wage would be a better fit for Wisconsin.\n\nChelsea Clinton said she \"would think\" that her mother will visit Wisconsin before April 5. Bernie Sanders will speak in Madison on Saturday.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Campaigning in Milwaukee Thursday, Chelsea Clinton said her mother, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, would be the better choice for Democratic voters in the April 5 Wisconsin presidential primary.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"site_name": "Wisconsin Public Radio", "description": "Campaigning in Milwaukee Thursday, Chelsea Clinton said her mother, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, would be the better choice for Democratic voters in the April 5 Wisconsin presidential primary.", "title": "In Wisconsin, Chelsea Clinton Says Mother Knows Best About Being A Good President", "url": "http://www.wpr.org/wisconsin-chelsea-clinton-says-mother-knows-best-about-being-good-president", "image": {"width": 400, "identifier": "http://www.wpr.org/sites/default/files/field/image/CQ%20Chelsea%20Clinton.jpg", "type": "image/png", "height": 113}, "updated_time": "2016-03-25T11:22:28-05:00", "type": "non_profit"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.wpr.org/wisconsin-chelsea-clinton-says-mother-knows-best-about-being-good-president", "image": {"src": "http://www.wpr.org/sites/default/files/field/image/CQ%20Chelsea%20Clinton.jpg"}, "description": "Campaigning in Milwaukee Thursday, Chelsea Clinton said her mother, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, would be the better choice for Democratic voters in the April 5 Wisconsin presidential primary.", "card": "summary", "title": "In Wisconsin, Chelsea Clinton Says Mother Knows Best About Being A Good President"}, "google-site-verification": "Ukk5s8ccVPrwPoz56A53G8_h2BhextrcODIdHDAl-WQ", "keywords": "Wisconsin Public Radio, WPR, Wisconsin News, Wisconsin Politics, Wisconsin, Public Radio, Music, Classical Music, Entertainment, Arts, Culture, In-Depth News, Analysis, NPR in Wisconsin", "article": {"published_time": "2016-03-24T19:39:11-05:00", "modified_time": "2016-03-25T11:22:28-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=4, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Chelsea Clinton, hillary clinton, Bernie Sanders, Democratic primary, campaigning, Wisconsin Vote"}, "article_summary": "Chelsea Clinton said she \"would think\" that her mother will visit Wisconsin before April 5.\nCampaigning in Milwaukee Thursday, Chelsea Clinton said her mother, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, would be the better choice for Democratic voters in the April 5 Wisconsin presidential primary.\nThe younger Clinton told news reporters that her mom has a lot of experience with some key issues.\nEarlier this week, Jane Sanders, wife of Hillary Clinton's Democratic rival, U.S. Sen.
