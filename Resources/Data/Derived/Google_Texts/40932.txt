LOS ANGELES (AP) — A wave of brief but fierce storms rolled through Southern California mountains and deserts on Saturday, leaving 40 bicycle racers with hypothermia and possibly causing a 14-car highway pileup in the desert that injured nine people, authorities said.

Monsoonal moisture moving up from the south connected with warmer air inland and created thunderstorms that prompted flash flood warnings and watches in parts of San Diego, San Bernardino and Riverside counties.

In San Bernardino County, gusty winds kicked up blinding dust on Interstate 40 east of Barstow. That may have caused a crash shortly before 10:30 a.m. in Newberry Springs that involved 10 big-rigs and four sedans, said Otto Schramm with the county Fire Department.

Nine people suffered minor injuries, he said.

Monsoonal weather in New Mexico flooded downtown Albuquerque and left some people stranded in their cars. Fire crews rescued several people Friday night as flash flooding hit the downtown. Parts of Arizona were also deluged Friday and got a second soaking Saturday. Authorities say runoff from rain on Friday night caused flooding in areas of metropolitan Phoenix, stranding at least one motorist.

In California’s San Bernardino Mountains, the 100-mile contest in the annual Tour de Big Bear race was disrupted when a storm dumped rain on bicyclists on 8,400-foot-high Onyx Peak.
