According to a Politico investigation, the group raised and spent $250 million in 2012 to shape political and policy debates. According to IRS filings, the group has 200 donors, each of whom paid at least $100,000 in annual dues. And while its head, Marc Short, claims that, \u201cour members are proud to be part of [the organization],\u201d they refuse to be publicly identified. So, proud to be a part of it, as long as you don\u2019t know who I am?\n\nOne of the main targets of Freedom Partners is Obamacare with $115 million given to the Center to Protect Patient Rights, a group that strongly opposes Obamacare, and $15.7 million to 60 Plus Association, a seniors group that also opposes Obamacare. As a side note, given that most people 65 and older qualify for Medicare\u2014a single-payer health care program\u2014I find 60 Plus Association\u2019s opposition to efforts to improve our health care system particularly lame.\n\nFreedom Partners also gives generously to Americans for Prosperity, American Future Fund, and Themis Trust, which is a Koch-based voter database. In fact, even though Short tries to downplay the role the Koch brothers play, it\u2019s clear the Koch footprint is all over Freedom Partners and its activities. Besides Short, the directors of Freedom Partners include Richard Find, Kevin Gentry, Nestor Weigand, and Wayne Gable.\n\nThe New Republic takes a closer look at these men and sure enough, the Koch footprint is everywhere. Richard Fink helped found a number of political groups and think tanks the Kochs have funded over the years. Nestor Weigand is a long-time friend of Charles Koch. Wayne Gable served as director of Koch Industries\u2019 federal affairs operation and president of two of the brother\u2019s foundation, the Charles G. Koch Foundation and the Claude R. Lambe Foundation. Kevin Gentry is a leader of the Koch\u2019s corporate lobbying arm and coordinates the semi-regular fundraising and strategy conference.\n\nThe vast web of influence the Koch brothers created is often called the Kochtepus. But, given the destructive and toxic nature of their political spending, I see the Koch brothers as more of an airborne disease\u2014spreading quickly and contaminating everything they touch.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Demos", "description": "Have you heard of the Freedom Partners?
