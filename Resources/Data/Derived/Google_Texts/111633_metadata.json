The Simi Valley resident who died of West Nile complications last week remains the county's only fatality from the virus, Levin said.\n\nHe said one West Nile patient was still in the hospital Friday morning but others have been released and are doing better.\n\nEnvironmental health experts note hot weather places like Simi Valley can attract mosquitoes. Levin said clusters of cases happen sometimes with no real explanation.\n\n\"There's no logical reason for it,\" he said, noting that public health and environmental health officials have talked about redoubling control efforts. The efforts include regularly checking some 700 breeding sites in Simi Valley.\n\nTwo victims spent significant amounts of time outside Ventura County and could have contracted the virus elsewhere, Levin said.\n\nEnvironmental health officials reported two more birds collected in Ventura County have tested positive for West Nile virus.\n\nOne bird was collected in the Oak Park area. The other was found in Ventura.\n\nTo report any potential mosquito-breeding sources in Ventura County, call the mosquito complaint hotline at 658-4310. To report wild birds that have died recently, call the California Department of Public Health at 877-968-2473.\n\nFor more on West Nile, go to http://www.cdc.gov/westnile/.", "article_metadata": {"title": "Four of five West Nile cases involve Simi Valley", "og": {"url": "http://www.vcstar.com/news/local/county/four-of-five-west-nile-cases-involve-simi-valley-ep-1323896897-350413971.html", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.jrn.com/images/mosquito_25318672_ver1.0_640_480.jpg", "height": 430}, "type": "article", "description": "Four of the five Ventura County residents who contracted West Nile virus are from Simi Valley, a county official said Friday.", "title": "Four of five West Nile cases involve Simi Valley"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.jrn.com/images/mosquito_25318672_ver1.0_640_480.jpg", "description": "Four of the five Ventura County residents who contracted West Nile virus are from Simi Valley, a county official said Friday.", "site": "https://twitter.com/vcstar", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Four of five West Nile cases involve Simi Valley"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://media.jrn.com/designimages/logo-vcs-icon-144.png", "__sync_contentCategory": "premium", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe011b\"", "article_summary": "Four of the five Ventura County residents who became sick from West Nile virus are from Simi Valley, a county official said Friday.\nThe Simi Valley resident who died of West Nile complications last week remains the county's only fatality from the virus, Levin said.\nHe said one West Nile patient was still in the hospital Friday morning but others have been released and are doing better.\nEnvironmental health officials reported two more birds collected in Ventura County have tested positive for West Nile virus.\nFor more on West Nile, go to http://www.cdc.gov/westnile/."}
