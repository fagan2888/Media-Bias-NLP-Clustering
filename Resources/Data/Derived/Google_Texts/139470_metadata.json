Colorblindness helps to legitimate the substance of dog whistle complaints because it promotes understandings of race and racism that obscure discrimination against nonwhites and magnify the ostensible mistreatment of whites. \u201cIs your baby racist?\u201d The question blared from the cover of Newsweek Magazine in September 2009, eight months after the inauguration of the nation\u2019s first black president. The accompanying story reported on several recent studies showing that young children not only notice race, they repeat painful stereotypes. In one study, a researcher recruited roughly 100 families from Austin, Texas; all of the families were white, with children between the ages of five and seven. When the children were asked how many white people were \u201cmean,\u201d they commonly answered \u201calmost none.\u201d But when asked how many blacks were mean, many answered \u201csome\u201d or \u201ca lot.\u201d The thrust of the article seemed to be that children possess racial biases. However eye-catching the title, though, it pointed in the wrong direction\u2014at infants and little children rather than adults. The core of the article focused on parenting strategies, and especially on the desire to raise children to be colorblind\u2014to be blind to race. The parents were not teaching their children to be bigots. Instead, they were doing their utmost to teach their children to reject racism by studiously ignoring race. Yet, even in a liberal bastion like Austin, it wasn\u2019t working. Today the dominant etiquette around race is colorblindness. It has a strong moral appeal, for it laudably envisions an ideal world in which race is no longer relevant to how we perceive or treat each other. It also has an intuitive practical appeal: to get beyond race, colorblindness urges, the best strategy is to immediately stop recognizing and talking about race. But it is especially as a strategy that colorblindness fails its liberal adherents. We cannot will ourselves to un-see something that we\u2019ve already seen. In turn, refusing to talk about a powerful social reality doesn\u2019t make that reality go away, but it does leave confused thinking unchallenged, in ourselves and in others. The Austin children exemplify this. Differences in race\u2014including physical variation and its connection to social position\u2014resemble differences in gender: they are plainly visible to new minds eager to make sense of the world around them. When unexplained, however, children (and our unconscious minds) are left susceptible to the power of stereotypes. As the Newsweek authors conclude, \u201cchildren see racial differences as much as they see the difference between pink and blue\u2014 but we tell kids that \u2018pink\u2019 means for girls and \u2018blue\u2019 is for boys. \u2018White\u2019 and \u2018black\u2019 are mysteries we leave them to figure out on their own.\u201d\n\nWe should also acknowledge that colorblindness has an additional appeal: it seems to provide a safe route through the minefield of race relations. Many whites are understandably nervous to talk about race at all, though especially in racially mixed company. What if they slip and say something that sounds ignorant, or worse, bigoted? Simply avoiding race altogether seems to offer a solution. Yet, those who adopt a colorblind strategy often come across as more racially hostile, not less. Refusing to acknowledge obvious social differences creates an impression of suppressed dislike, and studies have shown that whites who studiously avoid mentioning race even when it is clearly relevant are perceived as more bigoted. Perhaps this contributed to how the Austin children came to interpret their parents\u2019 racial attitudes, after their parents tried so hard to suppress references to race. Asked \u201cdo your parents like black people,\u201d more than half either said \u201cno, my parents don\u2019t like black people,\u201d or simply answered, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d The researchers remarked, \u201cin this supposed race-free vacuum being created by parents, kids were left to improvise their own conclusions\u2014 many of which would be abhorrent to their parents.\u201d If colorblindness seems to backfire, is there something that does help our children\u2014and us\u2014navigate the dangerous shoals of race? Yes: talking openly about racial differences and what they might mean. Psychological research shows that cognitive biases in social judgment \u201ccan be controlled only through subsequent, deliberate \u2018mental correction\u2019 that takes group status squarely into account.\u201d The Austin researchers reached a similar conclusion, for they urged parents to use in the racial context the express methods they employ to help children overcome gender stereotypes. \u201cParents are very comfortable talking to their children about gender, and they work very hard to counter-program against boy-girl stereotypes. That ought to be our model for talking about race. The same way we remind our [children], \u2018Mommies can be doctors just like daddies,\u2019 we ought to be telling all children that doctors can be any skin color. It\u2019s not complicated what to say. It\u2019s only a matter of how often we reinforce it.\u201d In other words, best practices in the area of race involve doing the opposite of what colorblindness seems to command. We must notice and talk about race, self-critically and carefully, in order to understand and attempt to set aside its power over our imaginations.\n\nAs the Austin families found out, colorblindness fails as a strategy for transcending race on an interpersonal level. It\u2019s bad advice for those genuinely endeavoring to eliminate racism from their lives. It\u2019s also bad advice for those seeking to comprehend and respond to dog whistle politics. Dog whistling cannot be resisted by refusing to talk about race, for this only leaves constant racial insinuations unchallenged, operating in the background to panic many whites. Indeed, dog whistle racism is not only protected by colorblindness, it rests fundamentally on colorblind myth-making. Much more than a racial etiquette, colorblindness provides a powerful framework shaping how people think about race and racism, and in doing so it helps give credence to dog whistle themes. Part of the power of colorblindness comes from its liberal origins and its close association with civil rights heroes, a linkage conservatives constantly belabor. Beyond this, the potency of colorblindness comes from what it teaches about racial discrimination, lessons almost always gleaned at the level of commonsense. Under the umbrella of colorblindness, ideas regarding race and racism geared toward protecting the superior position of whites in society have evolved significantly since the civil rights era. After tracing the history and conservative hijacking of colorblindness, this chapter focuses on bringing to the surface the core stories colorblindness spins\u2014about the end of discrimination against minorities, the blame they deserve for their inferior social positions, the innocence of contemporary whites, and their racial victimization. These narratives undergird dog whistle politics in its effort to portray nonwhites as threats and whites as imperiled. Colorblindness: from radical to reactionary The term \u201ccolorblind\u201d comes to us from Justice John Marshall Harlan\u2019s lone dissent in Plessy v. Ferguson, the 1896 case that announced the \u201cseparate but equal\u201d standard that sanctioned racial segregation throughout society. Louisiana had recently enacted a law requiring that black and white railroad passengers ride in separate cars; turning back a challenge to this law as naked racial discrimination, eight justices voted to uphold it, thereby ensuring decades of group debasement symbolized and fortified by legally enforced segregation. Harlan dissented and declared\u2014in what amounted to aspiration rather than description\u2014that \u201cOur Constitution is color-blind, and neither knows nor tolerates classes among citizens.\u201d\n\nToday, conservative advocates of colorblindness use this term as a shorthand for their opposition to affirmative action. They contend that colorblindness means government should never take race into account, not even as a way to promote racial equality. In 2007, the conservative Supreme Court justices blocked public school districts from considering race when assigning pupils to schools, even when seeking to maintain hard-won integration. Justifying this rigid rule, Justice Clarence Thomas proclaimed himself \u201cquite comfortable with the company I keep. My view of the Constitution is Justice Harlan\u2019s view in Plessy: \u2018Our Constitution is color-blind.\u2019\u201d Thomas\u2019 invocation of Harlan to oppose integration is misplaced. First, Harlan clearly never meant to proscribe all governmental uses of race. Rather, Harlan advocated colorblindness to limit excessive oppression, in the context of what he supposed would be the eternal reign of white supremacy. He began the very paragraph in which he invoked colorblindness as follows: \u201cThe white race deems itself to be the dominant race in this country. And so it is, in prestige, in achievements, in education, in wealth and in power. So, I doubt not, it will continue to be for all time.\u201d Harlan approved of many government racial restrictions that codified what he perceived as the natural inferiority of blacks. Some years before Plessy, Harlan had voted to uphold an Alabama law forbidding interracial marriage. And two years after Plessy, Harlan wrote an opinion supporting a whites-only high school. Harlan\u2019s famous dissent was not a call that the country literally become blind to race; quite the contrary. Perceiving a world where racial hierarchy was fixed, Harlan interpreted the Constitution to allow society to mark boundaries around those naturally relegated to the bottom. Even so, unlike his brethern, he objected to extreme civic exclusion. Harlan opposed the segregated train cars at issue in Plessy because he felt they unfairly limited the capacity of blacks to participate in civil life and the marketplace, not because he opposed any governmental use of race, and certainly not because he thought, as contemporary colorblindness doctrine asserts, that the Constitution forbade state efforts to ameliorate racism. Notwithstanding Harlan\u2019s own limited conception of colorblindness, as the civil rights movement gathered steam in the 1940s, its leading lawyers seized on \u201ccolorblindness\u201d to challenge Jim Crow. The phrase \u201cOur Constitution is color-blind\u201d carried important rhetorical force, for in its simple declarative form it seemed to command an immediate end to all government laws mandating racial segregation. Thurgood Marshall, as lead counsel for the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, repeatedly encouraged his colleagues to cite Harlan\u2019s famous aphorism. One lawyer recalled that the Plessy dissent was Marshall\u2019s \u201cBible to which he turned during his most depressed moments. . . . I do not believe we ever filed a major brief in the pre-Brown days in which a portion of that opinion was not quoted. Marshall\u2019s favorite quotation was, \u2018Our Constitution is colorblind.\u2019 . . . It became our basic creed.\u201d Clarence Thomas uses \u201ccolorblindness\u201d more in the manner of Thurgood Marshall than John Harlan, as an argument against all government uses of race. Yet there is a crucial difference: Marshall did so when states overwhelmingly used race to humiliate and exclude; Thomas does so now that government virtually only employs race to remedy centuries of racism.\n\nIn 1954, the Supreme Court in Brown v. Board of Education overturned Plessy and formally ended school segregation. Notably, though, the justices did not adopt a colorblind bar on all government uses of race. Adopting strict colorblindness would have battered apart the entire edifice of segregation laws at once. The Supreme Court preferred to dismantle segregation \u201cwith all deliberate speed.\u201d Put bluntly, this reflected a decision to temporize: the Court feared taking on too much too rapidly. It particularly sought to avoid abruptly declaring unconstitutional the emotional core of white supremacy\u2014the ban on interracial marriage. Just after Brown, the Court used a procedural feint to avoid deciding a miscegenation case. Only piecemeal and over time did the Court extend Brown to completely outlaw segregation, waiting over 13 years before it finally knocked down laws banning marriage between whites and persons of different races in Loving v. Virginia. Ironically, while the Court initially eschewed colorblind reasoning in order to protect segregation from too sudden an assault, over time the decision not to flatly prohibit government distinctions based on race came to seem wise for the goals of racial justice. By the mid-1960s, it was clear that through state subterfuge and social convention, racial segregation readily continued even absent laws expressly mandating it. As late as 1965, 11 years after school segregation was declared unconstitutional, fewer than 1 in 100 black students in the South attended schools formerly white by law, and the number of whites in predominantly black schools was infinitesimally small. Though absolute colorblindness had been their watchword for decades, in the late 1960s civil rights lawyers dropped this demand. Instead, they began to stress the necessity of actively taking race into account to promote meaningful integration. This meant more than getting the Court to move faster than \u201cwith all deliberate speed.\u201d It meant actively pursuing integration through measures that used race as a tool, including through race-conscious placements of students, teachers, and administrators, and through the race-conscious allocation of resources.\n\nRace-conscious efforts to promote integration reflected a basic insight about racial inequality: outlawing mistreatment was a step in the right direction, but by itself would not significantly correct settled disadvantage. Martin Luther King, Jr., expressed this idea using the metaphor of a foot race. In his 1964 book Why We Can\u2019t Wait, King lamented: whenever the issue of compensatory or preferential treatment for the Negro is raised, some of our friends recoil in horror. The Negro should be granted equality, they agree; but he should ask for nothing more. On the surface, this appears reasonable, but it is not realistic. For it is obvious that if a man is entered at the starting line in a race three hundred years after another man, the first would have to perform some impossible feat in order to catch up with his fellow runner. For King, and for the civil rights movement more generally, the goal was not merely to end formal segregation, but to break the deep connection between race and disadvantage. Simply declaring segregation laws illegal would not make African Americans \u201cequal\u201d in the eyes of a society steeped in degrading views of nonwhites. Nor would the end of formal segregation by itself equip a people hobbled by centuries of oppression to singlehandedly overcome the economic legacy of racism, especially in a society still accustomed to reserving the best jobs, neighborhoods, and schools for whites. Widespread acceptance of the supposed inferiority of blacks and the concrete realities of a stratified society combined to limit the life chances of those glibly declared \u201cequal\u201d and \u201cfree\u201d the moment Jim Crow laws were struck down. As King recognized, true equality would be a long-term, arduous process. In this effort, policies and programs that used race as a basis for planning, for the distribution of resources and contracts, and for the allocation of spots in universities and workplaces, provided the most direct way to begin the process of social repair. The rise of conservative colorblindness Brown\u2019s command to end segregation provoked fervent opposition in the South,including political posturing by demagogic politicians like George Wallace and race riots by whites\u2014and it also engendered a conservative reworking of colorblindness. Marshall himself had worried that colorblindness had an Achilles heel. While a colorblind ruling had the potential to overturn at once all segregation laws, it seemed to require no more than an end to such laws, not actual integration. For the government to be technically colorblind, it need do nothing more than avoid direct references to race in its laws. This insight was scarcely lost on the recalcitrant South. A federal district court in South Carolina articulated a colorblind argument against integration as early as 1955: \u201cThe Constitution . . . does not require integration. It merely forbids discrimination. It does not forbid such segregation as occurs as the result of voluntary action. It merely forbids the use of governmental power to enforce segregation.\u201d From here, it was but a short logical jump to the contention that colorblindness prohibited race-conscious integration measures. In 1965, the same court approvingly quoted the conclusion that \u201cthe Constitution is color-blind; it should no more be violated to attempt integration than to preserve segregation.\u201d Thus by 1965, a conservative form of colorblindness had emerged: according to the newest friends of the theory, the Constitution forbade any state use of race, whether to segregate or\u2014and this was the real agenda\u2014to integrate.", "article_metadata": {"description": "MLK dreamed of a world where race doesn't divide us \u2014 not one where we pretend it doesn't exist", "title": "How conservatives hijacked \u201ccolorblindness\u201d and set civil rights back decades", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "MLK dreamed of a world where race doesn't divide us \u2014 not one where we pretend it doesn't exist", "title": "How conservatives hijacked \u201ccolorblindness\u201d and set civil rights back decades", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/01/20/how_conservatives_hijacked_colorblindness_and_set_civil_rights_back_decades/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/01/martin_luther_king.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "MLK dreamed of a world where race doesn't divide us \u2014 not one where we pretend it doesn't exist", "title": "How conservatives hijacked \u201ccolorblindness\u201d and set civil rights back decades", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/01/martin_luther_king.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Ian Haney-Lopez", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Barry Goldwater, Conservatism, Dog Whistle Politics, Ian Haney Lopez, Martin Luther King, Racism, Ronald Reagan, Segregation, Supreme Court", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "It also has an intuitive practical appeal: to get beyond race, colorblindness urges, the best strategy is to immediately stop recognizing and talking about race.\nThough absolute colorblindness had been their watchword for decades, in the late 1960s civil rights lawyers dropped this demand.\nBy the mid-1960s, it was clear that through state subterfuge and social convention, racial segregation readily continued even absent laws expressly mandating it.\nPart of the power of colorblindness comes from its liberal origins and its close association with civil rights heroes, a linkage conservatives constantly belabor.\nNotwithstanding Harlan\u2019s own limited conception of colorblindness, as the civil rights movement gathered steam in the 1940s, its leading lawyers seized on \u201ccolorblindness\u201d to challenge Jim Crow."}
