Almost 300 homes in the Trail of the Woods neighborhood are one step closer to getting broadband Internet service.

Councillor Ken Ferdinands has been spearheading discussions between Bell, Vianet and residents to provide homes in the Aurora/Kennedy roads area with fibre-to-the-address internet connectivity.

A fibre optic network is extended from a hub with a direct connection to each participating residence, according to a report that goes to a town council meeting Tuesday.

There is a catch. The residents of the estate development west of Ballantrae need to fund the up-front design and construction costs associated with the network’s establishment.

The report did not provide costing details.

If the pilot project gets the go-ahead, the municipality would act as a banker/facilitator between the ISP and residents.

In its role of banker, the municipality would receive the money required to design and construct the network from the residents and upon completion of key elements, pay the ISP from the fund, according to the report.

The town would impose an administrative fee “to cover the reasonable expenses for staff resources, overhead and disbursements associated with the role of the facilitator,” according to the council report.

The report does not provide information on what that administrative fee would be.

Upon completion of the network, the town would not be the network’s owner/operator. It would be the ISP, as per normal business practices.

The council meeting takes place in town hall, 111 Sandiford Dr.. It starts at 7 p.m.
