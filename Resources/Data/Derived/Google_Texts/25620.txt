Republican U.S. Sen. David Vitter took care of both campaign and congressional business in northeastern Louisiana Saturday.

Vitter, who is considered the front-runner in this fall’s governor’s race, first attended a grand opening for his Monroe campaign headquarters in Suite 122 at 1600 Kansas Lane.

“We’ve always had a Northeast Louisiana office and made sure we’ve always been a part of the Monroe community,” Vitter said. “That’s why we’re excited about opening a campaign headquarters here for my run for governor. We want the community to know we’re here, we’ve been here and we’re going to be here, not just in an election year.”

He then stepped into his congressional role with a visit to the Northeast Louisiana War Veterans Home in Monroe as part of the Chennault Aviation and Military Museum’s Spirit of ’45 World War II celebration.

And from there Louisiana’s senior senator attended the Blanc Du Bois Stomp Fest at Landry Vineyards and Winery in western Ouachita Parish.

Vitter submitted Landry Vineyards into the Congressional Record as Small Business of the Week in February.

During Saturday’s festival Vitter presented vineyard owners Jeff and Libby Landry with the Congressional Record.
