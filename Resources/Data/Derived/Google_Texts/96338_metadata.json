Ted Cruz, about his eligibility for the presidency. Over and over, Trump has urged Cruz, who was born in Canada to a U.S. citizen mother and a Cuban father, to go to the courts to seek a declaratory judgment finding that he does in fact meet the constitutional requirement that a president be a \u201cnatural born\u201d citizen of the United States.\n\nFor the most part, Trump has been couching his comments about Cruz\u2019s status in the guise of worry about a Democratic assault on the Texan\u2019s legitimacy were he to actually be elected. In a tweet on Tuesday, for instance, Trump wrote, \u201cSuch a serious problem for Ted & the GOP. Great doubt, Dems will sue! Let's all work together to solve this problem.\u201d\n\nRelated: David Brooks\u2019 (Slightly) Unfair Attack on Ted Cruz\n\nPolitical reporters and commentators, including this one, have dismissed Trump\u2019s comments about Cruz\u2019s birth in Canada as a transparent attempt to muddy the political waters \u2013 to create doubt on the part of Cruz supporters about his viability while at the same time playing to the anti-immigrant sentiments that appear to be motivating much of Trump\u2019s political support.\n\nUnder long-established law, children born to U.S. citizens are automatically citizens themselves, regardless of where they are born. Therefore, the thinking goes, there is no question about whether or not Cruz is eligible for the presidency.\n\nOn Tuesday, though, Trump\u2019s suggestion that Cruz has a constitutional problem received some unexpected support from a pair of law professors who, in separate op-ed pieces in The Boston Globe and The Washington Post, argued that it is far from clear that Cruz meets the \u201cnatural born citizen\u201d requirement.\n\nThe more high-profile of the two was attorney and Harvard Law School professor Laurence Tribe, who penned an article for the Globe noting that the courts have never actually adjudicated the question of what makes someone a natural born citizen. In the article, he sides with Trump, arguing that under the definitions common when the Constitution was drafted, Cruz would not be considered natural born.\n\nRelated: Bush\u2019s Awkward and Unfunny Ad Attacks Rubio\u2019s Boots\n\n\u201c[T]he legal principles that prevailed in the 1780s and \u201990s required that someone actually be born on US soil to be a \u2018natural born\u2019 citizen,\u201d he wrote. \u201cEven having two US parents wouldn\u2019t suffice. And having just an American mother, as Cruz did, would have been insufficient at a time that made patrilineal descent decisive.\u201d\n\nThe more interesting \u2013 and arguably more convincing \u2013 article though is the Post piece by Widener University Law School Professor Mary Brigid McManamon. A legal historian, McManamon lays out the common-law definition of \u201cnatural born\u201d citizen as it would have been understood at the time the Constitution was drafted. She also points out that Congress established a process for the automatic naturalization of children born abroad to U.S. citizens.\n\nHer point is that any person who must be naturalized \u2013 even if the naturalization occurs simultaneously with his or her birth, does not meet the definition of a natural born citizen.\n\nShe, like Tribe, makes no argument that such a requirement is just or desirable \u2013 only that a plain reading of the Constitution and the common law concepts on which it relies, requires it.\n\nRelated: Trump Plays the Birther Card on Cruz \u2013 and It\u2019s Working\n\n\u201cCruz is, of course, a U.S. citizen \u2026 Because of the senator\u2019s parentage, he did not have to follow the lengthy naturalization process that aliens without American parents must undergo. Instead, Cruz was naturalized at birth,\u201d she writes.\n\nMcManamon also points out that automatic naturalization has not always been part of U.S. law \u2013 meaning that the children of citizens born abroad have not always been considered citizens.\n\n\u201cCongress simply does not have the power to convert someone born outside the United States into a natural-born citizen,\u201d she concludes.\n\nCruz pushed back on Tuesday against the arguments being made against his eligibility, but did so mainly with ad hominem attacks against those questioning his eligibility.\n\nRelated: Cruz Demands information on the Parents of Accused Terrorists\n\n\u201cIt is more than a little strange to see Donald relying on, as authoritative, a liberal left-wing judicial activist Harvard Law professor who is a huge Hillary [Clinton] supporter. It starts to make you think gosh, why are Hillary\u2019s strongest supporters backing Donald Trump?\u201d\n\nNotably, Cruz didn\u2019t directly address the merits of the claim.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Donald Trump has spent most of the past two weeks relentlessly concern-trolling his cl", "title": "Trump\u2019s Birther Attacks on Cruz Gain Some Surprising Support", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/01/13/Trump-s-Birther-Attacks-Cruz-Gain-Some-Surprising-Support", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/trump_cruz.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/01/13/Trump-s-Birther-Attacks-Cruz-Gain-Some-Surprising-Support", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/trump_cruz.jpg", "creator": "@rrgarver", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Donald Trump has spent most of the past two weeks relentlessly concern-trolling his cl", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "A legal historian, McManamon lays out the common-law definition of \u201cnatural born\u201d citizen as it would have been understood at the time the Constitution was drafted.\nRelated: Bush\u2019s Awkward and Unfunny Ad Attacks Rubio\u2019s Boots\u201c[T]he legal principles that prevailed in the 1780s and \u201990s required that someone actually be born on US soil to be a \u2018natural born\u2019 citizen,\u201d he wrote.\nIn the article, he sides with Trump, arguing that under the definitions common when the Constitution was drafted, Cruz would not be considered natural born.\nDonald Trump has spent most of the past two weeks relentlessly concern-trolling his closest competitor for the Republican presidential nomination, Texas Sen.
