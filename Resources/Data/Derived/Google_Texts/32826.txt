First Lady Michelle Obama takes the microphone to deliver remarks during her workshop titled “I’m Every Woman: The History of Women in Soul” in the State Dining Room at the White House on Thursday (March 6) in Washington, DC.

The 50-year-old first lady was joined at the function by singers Janelle Monae, Melissa Ethridge, and Patti LaBelle.

Later in the evening, President Obama delivered remarks at the Women of Soul concert series, where he accidentally misspelled Aretha Franklin‘s “Respect”!

“When Aretha [Franklin] first told us what R-S-P-E-C-T meant to her, she had no idea it would become a rallying cry for African Americans, and women, and then everyone who felt marginalized because of what they looked like or who they loved,” President Obama said. “They wanted some respect.”
