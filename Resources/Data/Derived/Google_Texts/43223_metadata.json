He ran for mayor unsuccessfully in 2007 and is the grandson of Metro's first mayor, Beverly Briley.\n\nGarrett, 64, a funeral director who lives in Goodlettsville, has served as an at-large councilman since 2007. His previous elective office includes district councilman from 1983-1999 and state representative from 1984-2004.\n\nBoth men are intelligent, capable and talented. However, they possess different leadership styles.\n\nBriley told the editorial board that his approach focuses on listening and consensus building.\n\nGarrett told the board that his approach focuses on being the chief advocate of the council and a counterpoint to the mayor, when necessary.\n\nIt's a soft power versus hard power approach that each would be able to execute effectively because of his personality.\n\nAbout Briley\n\nBriley said his platform is focused on three issues: inclusion, transparency and accountability.\n\nHe said he favors engaging the public early and making sure everyone understands the process to avoid rejection of mayoral priorities in the future.\n\nHe wants to work with the mayor in a collaborative manner.\n\n\"It's not about being adversarial, but about being persistent,\" he said.\n\nBriley wants to meet with every council member to figure out their priorities and place them on the committees that best suit their talents.\n\nHe also wants to provide members of the council \"more latitude\" when it comes to making their points on the council floor.\n\nAbout Garrett\n\nGarrett sees the vice mayor's role as a \"cheerleader for the council\" but also as someone having a \"say-so\" in what the mayor is doing.\n\n\"The last mayors have been able to do whatever they wanted,\" said Garrett, referring to large projects such as arenas and convention centers.\n\nHis experience in the council has taught him the value of having committee chairs with a few years of experience and keeping members on those committees to avoid creating an unnecessary learning curve.\n\nHe also criticizes what he says is the current lack of debate on the council floor.\n\n\"We have no debate on the floor,\" he said.\n\nHis residency in Goodlettsville has made him especially empathetic to the voices of neighborhoods that have felt slighted by the city's focus on downtown economic development.\n\nAll candidates for countywide seat, from the mayor to vice mayor to at-large council members, should model this sentiment.\n\nEndorsement process schedule\n\nTuesday: Publication of Nashville vice mayoral endorsement\n\nTuesday: Release of Ready to Serve assessment of mayoral, vice mayoral and Metro Council candidates on Tennessean.com\n\nTuesday: Live chat on Tennessean.com at 7:30 p.m. with Opinion Editor David Plazas on the endorsement decisions\n\nRead or Share this story: http://tnne.ws/1IXjnl6", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "The Tennessean editorial board endorses David Briley to preside over Metro Council.", "og": {"site_name": "The Tennessean", "description": "The Tennessean editorial board endorses David Briley to preside over Metro Council.", "title": "Tennessean editorial board: Elect David Briley as vice mayor", "url": "http://www.tennessean.com/story/opinion/editorials/2015/07/14/nashville-vice-mayoral-endorsement/30110751/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/tennessean.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The Tennessean editorial board endorses David Briley to preside over Metro Council.", "title": "Tennessean editorial board: Elect David Briley as vice mayor", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/f53f85470236dd4d0338f5b626b3bdb2decd9771/c=0-108-1000-1108&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/07/13/Nashville/B9318031774Z.1_20150713191704_000_G6UBBDII1.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@tennessean", "site": "@tennessean", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600028886", "fb": {"app_id": 121487414583460}, "viewport": "width=1070", "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/davidplazas"}, "Content-Type": "text/html;
