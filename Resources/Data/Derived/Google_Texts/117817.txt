BUIES CREEK, N.C. (WNCN) – Sen. Richard Burr, a Republican running for re-election in 2016, visited Campbell University’s medical school on Thursday.

WNCN political reporter Beau Minnick had a chance to talk to Burr about multiple issues. Here are some of the highlights of their conversation.

Burr on President Barack Obama’s executive action on gun control:

“I am concerned from a standpoint of what he asked governors to do. He asked governors to break the law.

“Healthcare privacy is a federal statute. You have to protect medical privacy of every patient.

“By saying to governors, ‘We want you to send the mental health records to the databank so that we can incorporate that in there,’ One, he asked them to break a federal law.”

On the 2016 election:

“From a standpoint of those Americans that were concerned with whether government has gotten too big or too intrusive in their lives, this will be an issue for them in November.”

On Obamacare:

“There are good things that came out of the president’s healthcare plan. We shouldn’t let preexisting conditions control whether somebody has access to insurance.”

But, he said, “When you look at the central promise of the Affordable Care Act, affordability, it’s been anything but that.

“We’ve made healthcare unaffordable for many that found it affordable before.”

In his role as chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, he said measuring intent is critical.

“Whether you’re talking about Kim Jong Un, whether you’re talking about ISIS, intent in many cases is a greater threat than their capabilities.

“If the intent there is to do something, then we have to spend a tremendous amount of time and efforts to make sure that we’re protected against that intent.”
