Rachel Ramsey, women’s hockey

The intrigue of Rachel Ramsey reaches well beyond her last name.

The Gophers senior has become one of the best scoring defensemen in women’s hockey and is a two-time national champion. Off the ice, she has become a Twin Cities radio personality and developed a love for sports broadcasting.

Ramsey — the daughter of Mike Ramsey, a member of the 1980 “Miracle on Ice” U.S. Olympic team, U.S. Hockey Hall of Famer and former Wild assistant coach — grew up skating at Xcel Energy Center. She was crafted into an All-America skater under her dad’s close watch.

Rachel, however, has found she likes being an observer just as much as being in the action. She expects one more national championship — the Gophers won in 2012 and 2013 — with this year’s loaded roster before welcoming a new direction in life.

“I’m kind of excited for next year when I can take a step back and be someone who is an observer rather than someone more in the action,” Ramsey said. “I see more and understand more than when I’m on the ice.”

Watch Ramsey’s Gophers charge toward another title, and listen for her perspectives on KFAN and K102.
