That\u2019s more than five years with no freezes, though it may feel like freezing to some on those cold winter mornings.\n\n\u201cFor some Tampa natives, it\u2019s freezing if it\u2019s in the upper 30s,\u201d said Rodney Wynn, a meteorologist with the weather service. \u201cBut the readings come from the airport, which is not far from the bay and that has an influence on the temperatures. There could have been some local spots that hit freezing, but our official spot is the airport.\u2019\u2019\n\nDespite mystical polar vortexes that bring wave after wave of unfathomable frigid temperatures and monster snowstorms to the Midwest and Northeast, Tampa appears again to have escaped the icy grasp of Old Man Winter.\n\nIn November, the season\u2019s first cold snap brought morning lows into the upper 30s, December and January had a couple similar mornings. The lows aren\u2019t expected to drop below 40 the rest of the month.\n\nIt\u2019s an unwritten rule, Wynn said, that the middle to end of February marks the end of freeze threats in the Tampa region.\n\nThe Farmer\u2019s Almanac says the weather around Tampa will have some rain, some sun and \u201ccool\u201d temperatures over the next two weeks, before becoming \u201cwarm\u201d during the last week of the month.\n\nThe venerable publication says the temperature next week may dip slightly below normal, but remain normal for the rest of February.\n\nThe average low for the second week in February is 53 degrees and daily lows typically are between 52 to 56 degrees. On average, three days in February dip below 40 degrees.\n\n\u201cThrough the end of February,\u201d Wynn said, \u201cwe\u2019re looking at pretty seasonal conditions, nothing below normal.\u201d\n\nEven with the assurances from the weather service that overnight lows shouldn\u2019t reach freezing for the rest of the winter, strawberry grower Matt Parke, with Parkesdale Farms in Plant City, said he thinks it could still get close to freezing near the end of February.\n\n\u201cWe have a late moon this month, right before March,\u201d he said, \u201cAnd a late moon guarantees we will have a freeze, or close to it.\u201d\n\nSo far this winter, he said, temperatures are just about right for the strawberry crop, currently being harvested throughout eastern Hillsborough County.\n\n\u201cIn my opinion, it\u2019s been perfect,\u201d he said. \u201cSome may disagree, but I think we\u2019re going to have a bumper crop this year. Everything is working out.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a cool winter, which is good,\u201d he said. \u201cLast year, we had a hot winter and that was bad. We actually got into the 30s this winter, though it hasn\u2019t been freezing. And that\u2019s good for the berries.\u201d\n\nCooler temperatures, like nights in the 40s or 50s, and days no hotter than 70, increase the sugar content in the fruit, he said.\n\nSprinklers were turned on to protect the crop one time last winter; this year the pumps remained silent, which saves growers money, he said.\n\n\u201cDiesel (which fuels the groundwater pumps) is the about the price of gold right now,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re definitely saving money on that.\u201d\n\nHe recalls years when there were 10 to 12 freezes a year, and that cuts way into the profit margin.\n\nWhat\u2019s good for strawberries, though, could be a boon for Florida\u2019s number one six-legged pest.\n\nCarlos Fernandez, director of Hillsborough County Mosquito Control, said his department hasn\u2019t gotten many requests for service about swarms of mosquitoes during this warm winter but figures that will change over the spring and summer.\n\n\u201cIt is something to expect,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you have warmer weather and warmer waters, it expedites the development of mosquitoes from eggs to the adult stage.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe effect of the warm winter on trees is as varied as the trees out there, said Jason Zysk, a certified arborist and owner of Greenworks.\n\nSome oak trees are hanging onto their leaves a bit longer, others are keeping acorns past the time they typically drop and some already are beginning to bloom.\n\nHe pointed to a stretch of road in Tampa where about 30 oak trees line the road and each one is in a different growth phase. Some are just beginning to lose leaves, others are flowering.\n\n\u201cThey are living things,\u201d he said. \u201cThey all are different.\u201d\n\nkmorelli@tampatrib.com\n\n(813) 259-7760", "article_metadata": {"taboola-pub-time": "Sun, 08 Feb 2015 15:28:28 -0400", "Description": "TAMPA \u2014 While some early morning temperatures this winter have touched on chilly, they have not gotten down to teeth-chattering, long-johns wearing, frostbiting, icicles-forming-on-the-strawbe", "og": {"site_name": "TBO.com", "description": "TAMPA \u2014 While some early morning temperatures this winter have touched on chilly, they have not gotten down to teeth-chattering, long-johns wearing, frostbiting, icicles-forming-on-the-strawbe", "title": "Tampa Bay area in its fifth winter without a freeze", "url": "http://www.tbo.com/list/weather-news/tampa-bay-area-in-its-fifth-winter-without-a-freeze-20150208/", "image": {"width": 4000, "identifier": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20150208/ARTICLE/150209327/AR/0/AR-150209327.jpg", "height": 2662}, "updated_time": "2015-02-08T15:28:00Z-04", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "tbo.com", "description": "TAMPA \u2014 While some early morning temperatures this winter have touched on chilly, they have not gotten down to teeth-chattering, long-johns wearing, frostbiting, icicles-forming-on-the-straw", "title": "Tampa Bay area in its fifth winter without a freeze", "image": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20150208/ARTICLE/150209327/AR/0/AR-150209327.jpg", "site": "@TBOcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 522234267826834}, "msvalidate.01": "29E67031F86E7FB6DF9823924E21B8B4", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/tbocom", "published_time": "2015-02-08T15:28:28Z-04", "modified_time": "2015-02-08T15:28:00Z-04"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Another winter in Tampa, another season that came and went, well almost, without a big freeze.\n\u201cFor some Tampa natives, it\u2019s freezing if it\u2019s in the upper 30s,\u201d said Rodney Wynn, a meteorologist with the weather service.\nIt\u2019s an unwritten rule, Wynn said, that the middle to end of February marks the end of freeze threats in the Tampa region.\nThe National Weather Service in Ruskin, which keeps daily temperatures at Tampa International Airport, said the last time the mercury dipped below 32 degrees was on Jan. 13, 2010.\nWhile some early morning temperatures this winter have touched on chilly, they have not gotten down to teeth-chattering, long-johns wearing, frostbiting, icicles-forming-on-the-strawberries cold."}
