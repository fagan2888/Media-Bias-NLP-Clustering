Lee and his colleagues Ted Cruz of Texas and Marco Rubio of Florida huddled with representatives of Tea Party groups like Heritage Action, ForAmerica, and the Tea Party Patriots. Their mission: to turn defunding Obamacare from a fringe idea with little congressional support into a popular movement. It worked. The groundswell the conservative groups helped create over the summer make conservatives in Congress aware of the fight, in turn forcing the hand of Republican leaders. Obamacare has not, of course, been defunded, but it was House Republicans' insistence on crippling the health-care bill as a condition of funding the government that brought about this week's shutdown. The real reason the House GOP hasn\u2019t backed down and passed a government-funding bill isn\u2019t because of 30-some intractable Tea Party members in their ranks or because Cruz refused to play along. It\u2019s because their loudest, most engaged constituents demanded it, amplified by the savvy, coordinated tactics of the right-wing pressure groups that have proved adept at leveraging grassroots pressure into Washington results. As Representative Greg Walden recently told a group of Republican donors, according to the Daily Beast: \u201cWe have to do this because of the Tea Party .... The Tea Party gets involved at the local level.\"\n\nPresident Obama\u2019s campaign ground game helped him win reelection; afterward, his supporters vowed to bring some of those tactics to bear on pressuring Congress to enact his agenda. But it\u2019s the Tea Party that has mastered this game, through a combination of savvy tactics and ruthless persistence. \"Republicans had never made a serious challenge to Obamacare. We concluded this was when it had to happen.\" At the time of the meeting in Lee's office, Congress was preparing for its summer vacation, and conservatives faced a dispiriting reality: On October 1, the Obamacare exchanges would open for business. When that happened, \u201cThe toothpaste would be out of the tube, and it would be be very difficult to put an end to this,\u201d said Brent Bozell, president of ForAmerica, a little-known but influential conservative group that relies mainly on social media. \u201cIt was a last-gasp effort.\u201d They knew where the pressure points were. Republicans owe their House majority to the Tea Party wave of 2010, which was spurred in turn largely by reaction to the health-care bill. The Tea Party has proved less than adept at winning general elections (see: Obama, President). But it has shown abundantly that it knows how to put the heat on in primaries (see: O'Donnell, Christine). With redistricting largely protecting incumbents in general elections, a primary threat is the biggest fear for most members of Congress. So the Tea Party groups went on the attack. ForAmerica was the most aggressive, making videos calling out senators as \u201cchicken\u201d \u2014 including Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham, both of whom face Tea Party challengers in primaries next year. Texas Senator John Cornyn, who is up for reelection but doesn\u2019t have a challenger, also got one. The activists knew they didn\u2019t have to make an ad for every Republican senator; once a few got the treatment, the rest got the message. Nobody wanted to be next on the list. \u201cRepublicans who had been committing themselves to putting an end to this wretched law since it passed really weren\u2019t doing anything,\u201d Bozell told me. \u201cYou had people telling their constituents, \u2018I voted against it 39 times\u2019 when those were just meaningless, procedural votes. They'd never made a serious challenge to Obamacare. We concluded this was when it had to happen.\u201d\n\nForAmerica\u2019s 3.5 million Facebook fans were instructed to call the offices of Republican leaders. They shut down the phone lines of Speaker John Boehner, McConnell, Cornyn, Majority Leader Eric Cantor, Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy, and others. When one office line stopped working, they\u2019d redirect callers to a different one. The group says it generated 60,000 calls. Other groups played complementary roles. Heritage Action drew hundreds to town halls in nine cities. ForAmerica and the Tea Party Patriots teamed up for a tour of a dozen states, the locations strategically chosen for maximum impact \u2014 like a rally in Lexington, Kentucky, to target McConnell \u2014 and culminating on the lawn of the Capitol. Meanwhile, Tea Party Patriots members held hundreds of rallies and protests in their home districts. Many were mock town halls featuring an empty chair to represent a member of congress who wasn\u2019t meeting with constituents. Rallies, protests, town halls, email petitions, call-in campaigns: None of these tactics are rocket science. But deployed strategically, with the coordination enabled by technology, they work. And they're cheap: ForAmerica and the Tea Party Patriots each estimated their campaigns cost about $200,000. To be sure, the groups' achievement falls far short of victory. While the campaigns have succeeded at bending the Washington debate, they haven't achieved a policy goal \u2014 to the contrary, the exchanges opened on schedule this week \u2014 nor have they won converts across the aisle. The Tea Party's clout shows both the possibilities and the limitations of grassroots pressure on Congress \u2014 a tactic that advocates of a different persuasion have tried and failed to mobilize behind goals like gun control and immigration reform. Where the right is concerned, however, the Tea Party's power shows no sign of waning. If anything, this battle appears to have emboldened the far right, a fact Boehner and his lieutenants have no doubt absorbed as they look ahead. Even if the speaker ignores the conservative faction of his caucus on the present issue, he will not have tamed this force. Bozell has no qualms about the heartburn he's caused for the GOP: \u201cI could give a damn,\" he said. \"I\u2019m fed up with the Washington elites of both parties.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The government is shut down, America is angry, and the endgame is unclear, but activists have shown their organizing prowess\u00a0by getting Congress this far.", "author": "Molly Ball", "og": {"site_name": "The Atlantic", "description": "The government is shut down, America is angry, and the endgame is unclear, but activists have shown their organizing prowess\u00a0by getting Congress this far.", "title": "Give the Tea Party Credit: Their Grassroots Tactics Worked", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2013/10/rtx13g4j/lead_large.jpg", "url": "http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2013/10/give-the-tea-party-credit-their-grassroots-tactics-worked/280260/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "theatlantic.com", "site": "@theatlantic", "card": "summary"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "p": {"domain_verify": "68e1a0361a557708fefc992f3309ed70"}, "fb": {"admins": "577048155,17301937", "page_id": 29259828486, "app_id": 100770816677686}, "keywords": "The Atlantic, The Atlantic Magazine, TheAtlantic.com, Atlantic, news, opinion, breaking news, analysis, commentary, business, politics, culture, international, science, technology, national and life", "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/mollyball"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, width=device-width, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb348\"", "article_summary": "Lee and his colleagues Ted Cruz of Texas and Marco Rubio of Florida huddled with representatives of Tea Party groups like Heritage Action, ForAmerica, and the Tea Party Patriots.\nBut it\u2019s the Tea Party that has mastered this game, through a combination of savvy tactics and ruthless persistence.\nSo the Tea Party groups went on the attack.\nThe Tea Party has proved less than adept at winning general elections (see: Obama, President).\nMeanwhile, Tea Party Patriots members held hundreds of rallies and protests in their home districts."}
