This is not meant as a comprehensive guide: I do not presume to make policy recommendations, but do hope that it will help readers better understand some of the issues at stake.\n\n1. The bailouts have extracted resources from Greece\n\nA common belief in discussions of the Greek economy is that the eurozone \u201chas become an extractive project that imposes austerity on poor nations in order to collect debts on behalf of rich ones\u201d. A recent study of capital flows to and from Greece by economists Jeremy Bulow and Kenneth Rogoff debunks this. As the tables below show, capital flows into Greece have not just remained positive, but have increased since the first bailout in 2010. 2014\u2019s flow is slightly negative, partly as the Greek government chose to miss reform targets, preventing release of bailout funds.\n\n\n\n\n\nSource-Jeremy Bulow, Kenneth Rogoff\n\n\n\n2. Bailouts benefit foreign banks more than Greeks\n\nAnother misconception is that: \u201cIt is not the people of Greece who have benefited from bailout loans \u2026 but the European and Greek banks which recklessly lent money to the Greek State.\u201d This was the charge of the Jubilee Debt Campaign, which campaigns for further debt relief for Greece. They report that \u20ac252 billion has been lent to Greece by the \u201cTroika\u201d (the EU, the European Central Bank and the IMF) since 2010, which they claim has been used as follows:\n\n\u20ac35 billion in \u201csweeteners\" to get the private sector to accept the 2012 debt restructuring\n\n\u20ac48 billion to bail out Greek banks following the restructuring\n\n\u20ac149 billion on paying the original debts and interest.\n\nThese add up to \u20ac232 billion, causing Jubilee to conclude that \u201cless than 10% of the money has reached the people of Greece\u201d.\n\nThis conclusion incorrectly assumes that none of the recipients of the \u20ac232 billion are \u201cpeople of Greece\u201d. But if the \u201csweeteners\u201d were for the Greek private sector, they benefited Greeks; bailing out Greek banks directly helps Greeks who have bank deposits, who hold shares in banks (whether directly or via their pensions), and who work for banks.\n\nThe best data that I\u2019ve seen suggests that Greek banks may have held just under half the Greek government debt before the 2012 restructuring \u2013 twice as much as any other country. Thus, payments to creditors also reached Greeks. Finally, even payments to foreign creditors benefit Greeks by removing obligations from Greeks to pay.\n\nPerhaps the most amazing estimate to come from Bulow and Rogoff\u2019s study is that Greek citizens have \u201cwithdrawn over a hundred billion euros from the banking system\u201d since 2010: where has that money gone?\n\n3. A debt-to-GDP ratio of 180% is unsustainable\n\nJapanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe, has said he will work with the G7 and other Asian countries to ensure economic and financial market stability as the eurozone grapples with Greece\u2019s debt crisis. This news is unremarkable and unsurprising: the third-largest economy in the world is standing by to help. Unreported is that Japan has the world\u2019s highest debt-to-GDP ratio, at about 240% \u2013 much higher than Greece\u2019s.\n\nFurthermore, Japan does not seem to have any easy measures for quickly reducing this: unemployment is already low, leaving little slack in the labour market. And, as one of the world\u2019s least corrupt countries, its unofficial sector is small, leaving little hope that actual GDP is much higher than official GDP. Japan faces serious economic challenges (including two decades almost without growth), but no one sees it as other than stable.\n\nBy contrast, there are many ways that Greece could quickly reduce its debt-to-GDP ratio: its unofficial economy is estimated at 25% of its official economy; while some officially unemployed Greeks may be working unofficially, many are not \u2013 so labour market reforms could spur rapid growth.\n\nThere\u2019s an open debate on how to interpret debt-to-GDP ratios and higher numbers are certainly worrying. Yet, Japan suggests there is no magic number: how a country can manage its debt depends on the circumstances and choices of that country.\n\n4. Greece\u2019s transition recession is unusually long\n\nThe graph below shows real GDP as a percentage of 1989 GDP in post-Soviet transition economies. Produced by economists Nauro Campos and Abrizio Coricelli, it shows that going through a political and economic transition simultaneously, without a coherent reform strategy, can be disastrous for economic growth. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, post-Soviet countries suffered decreases in official output for years, in spite of international support, including help from the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. Twelve years after 1989, only six of the 25 countries had official GDP figures above their 1989 levels.\n\nGDP in post-Soviet states in the decade after the collapse of the Soviet Union. Nauro Campos and Abrizio Coricelli\n\nGreece\u2019s political transitions between democratically elected governments have been less fundamental than the post-Soviet transitions, but its commitment to reform has been questionable throughout. Its poor performance in privatisating inefficient state-owned enterprises has drawn particular attention: the following graph shows privatisation not only well behind schedule, but falling further behind all the time. This deprives the Greek state of revenues, and the Greek people of more efficient services.\n\nSource IMF\n\nGreece finally seemed to have turned back up in 2014: having fallen by about 20% since its peak in 2008, real GDP grew, officially ending the recession; the government balanced its books before debt payments, and had earned a primary surplus in 2013; unemployment fell; the government was able to borrow on the regular markets, rather than via support packages.\n\nThus, one of the tragedies of the present situation is that protracted negotiations over the country\u2019s bailout conditions may have just increased the overall cost of the transition process.\n\n5. Greece is too big to fail\n\nThe idea that Greece is too big to fail and will have significant knock-on effects for global financial markets has been used in some of the brinkmanship at play in the country\u2019s debt negotiations \u2013 including by former finance minister Yanis Varoufakis.\n\nBut, while the Greek debt crisis has increased uncertainty and any further default or uncontrolled exit from the euro will pose costs, the markets do not seem terribly roiled by the prospect of its default. This is not surprising: Greece makes up about 2% of Europe\u2019s population and GDP; Europe\u2019s economy is stronger than it was in 2010-2012.\n\nAn underappreciated aspect of the \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d idea is what it does to an economy\u2019s prospects. Indeed, one of the leading explanations of Soviet economic decline is the \u201csoft budget constraint\u201d. Soviet firms tended to be much larger than their Western counterparts, giving each considerable power to renegotiate its production plans \u2013 without more resources, it could threaten to harm other sectors in the economy, which had few alternative suppliers to turn to.\n\nThis seems to be the concern expressed by many of the other European countries: at the eurozone\u2019s inception, the open question was whether the Bundesbank\u2019s credible, low-inflation, low-interest rate standard would prevail. Or whether the eurozone would end up converging on one of the less credible, high-inflation and high-interest rate standards. If the moving appeals of a country comprising 2% of Europe can successfully soften Europe\u2019s budget constraint, then it can be expected that any larger country will be able to as well, if they can demonstrate a severe enough crisis.\n\nWere Greece to become the first country to leave the eurozone, it would give us invaluable real experience in a fairly controlled context; this would improve eurozone policy when faced with similar situations in the future.\n\nThis article was published originally in The Conversation.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "It is widely accepted that the Greek bailout and austerity package has led to wealth f", "title": "5 Surprising Facts About the Greek Economy", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/07/13/5-Surprising-Facts-About-Greek-Economy", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/columns/07082015_Greece_Flags.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/07/13/5-Surprising-Facts-About-Greek-Economy", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/columns/07082015_Greece_Flags.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "It is widely accepted that the Greek bailout and austerity package has led to wealth f", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "The best data that I\u2019ve seen suggests that Greek banks may have held just under half the Greek government debt before the 2012 restructuring \u2013 twice as much as any other country.\nThis is not surprising: Greece makes up about 2% of Europe\u2019s population and GDP; Europe\u2019s economy is stronger than it was in 2010-2012.\nThis deprives the Greek state of revenues, and the Greek people of more efficient services.\nBut if the \u201csweeteners\u201d were for the Greek private sector, they benefited Greeks; bailing out Greek banks directly helps Greeks who have bank deposits, who hold shares in banks (whether directly or via their pensions), and who work for banks.\n2014\u2019s flow is slightly negative, partly as the Greek government chose to miss reform targets, preventing release of bailout funds."}
