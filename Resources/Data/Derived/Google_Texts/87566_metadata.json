Things were apparently going too well. Heritage Action, followed by Freedom Works, decided to key vote AGAINST voting on the special exemption, killing our chance to use a hugely powerful political issue and get far closer to impeding ACA than anything else in sight.\n\nIt is worth noting that there was neither policy or nor conservative principle buttressing this call, only a strategic decision that it wasn't \"big\" enough; instead they chose to protect a congressional special subsidy, demand a \"more\" that has already failed repeatedly, spare Democrats a difficult vote, kill an alternate conservative strategy (that actually has principle behind it as well as strategy as a prelude for the next fight), and likely leave us worse off. But, hey, their friends on the Hill will get to keep their special exemptions.\n\nIt is a Pogo moment, but we are not deterred. It is amazing that this effort has come as far as it has this quickly, and it is not going away - the principle, strategic value, and logic of it are just too compelling.
