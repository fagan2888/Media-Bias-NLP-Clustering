A $250,000 federal grant will fund an effort by the Methodist Healthcare Foundation, University of Memphis and West Cancer Center to involve patients, researchers and healthcare providers in narrowing cancer disparities in the Memphis area, Methodist officials announced.

The grant comes from the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute, which was created in 2010 with the Affordable Care Act. PCORI chose the project to receive one of its Eugene Washington PCORI Engagement Awards for this year. Washington was the first chairman of PCORI's board of governors.

University of Memphis School of Public Health assistant professor M. Paige Powell and West Cancer Center's director of care support services, Cynthia Tankersley, will lead the project with the Methodist foundation.

Fostering trust and partnerships with people in hard-to-reach groups to engage them in patient-centered outcomes research to reduce breast, lung and prostate cancers is the goal. A council involving patients, family members, researchers and health care providers will be formed to study innovative approaches.

"This project has the potential to get patients involved in improving cancer and outcomes in a new and exciting way," Powell said in a statement. "We are building the infrastructure and processes for patients to drive the research process so that it will truly be responsive to the community's needs."

The latest PCORI grant for the Memphis area joins one awarded in 2013, a $2.1 million award to the Baptist Cancer Center to study the effectiveness of a multidisciplinary model of care for lung cancer patients. The PCORI website features an August article on that research.
