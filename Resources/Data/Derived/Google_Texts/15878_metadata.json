It\u2019s no coincidence then that American labor law is a relic of the New Deal era\u2014when roughly one-third of the private sector was unionized.\n\nFirst came the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) in 1935, which clearly defined the right to unionize and recognized unfair labor practices on the part of employers. Then came the Taft-Hartley Act in 1947, which acknowledged that unions are responsible for many unfair practices of their own.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nYet nearing the end of 2015\u2014the 80th anniversary of the NLRA\u2019s passage\u2014national labor law is very much the same. Any attempt to update it has run aground, rendering the need for substantive reform more urgent than ever before.\n\nTo fill the legislative void, the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB)\u2014first established by the NLRA\u2014has become a pseudo-legislature of its own, issuing decisions and rules which not so much achieve viable reforms as they reflect the majority\u2019s political bias.\n\nIn recent years, the now Democrat-controlled NLRB has become a pro-union agency subjecting employers to crippling labor restrictions. In August, the NLRB ruled (along partisan lines) that unions can negotiate on behalf of employees working for franchisees and contractors\u2014easing the unionization process in the fast food industry.\n\n(Like clockwork, unions are now ramping up efforts to unionize McDonald\u2019s and other fast food chains.)\n\nThe United Auto Workers\u2019 (UAW) recent victory at a Tennessee Volkswagen plant is the result of a 2011 NLRB ruling which stated that collective bargaining units can be unionized bit by bit. That is, a so-called \u201cmicro-union\u201d can infiltrate a workplace even if the majority of the workforce sees no need for union representation. Only 162 employees are now included\u2014a tiny subset of the nearly 1,600 workers who rejected the union in 2014.\n\nThis begs a serious question: Should labor law be subject to the whims of unelected, politically biased bureaucrats in Washington? Or should we work toward meaningful reform through legislative channels, updating a 20th century legal framework for 2016 and beyond?\n\nCurrently pending before Congress are 18 different bills addressing NLRA reform, mostly in piecemeal fashion. One focuses on stalking in the workplace. Another vows to eliminate \u201cmicro-unions\u201d\u2014not just in Tennessee, but nationwide. Just last month, Rep. Joe Wilson Joe WilsonHouse GOP urges Obama to drop veto threat against defense bill Overnight Cybersecurity: Fight over feds' hacking powers moves to Congress New House caucus will help keep hackers out of cars MORE (R-S.C.) introduced the NLRB Reform Act, which would add a sixth member to the Board and mitigate the problem of hyper-partisanship.\n\nBut such proposals are limited in scope and stand little chance at passing.\n\nThe most comprehensive is the Employee Rights Act (ERA), which would update American labor law with a broad stroke. Recently reintroduced by Sen. Orrin Hatch Orrin HatchGOP senator reacts to Garland meeting before it happens Senate amendments could sink email privacy compromise Overnight Defense: VA chief 'deeply' regrets Disney remark; Senate fight brews over Gitmo MORE (R-Utah) and Rep. Tom Price (R-Ga.), the bill would democratize the workplace with several basic provisions\u2014encompassing employee privacy, free choice, personal safety, and periodic opportunities to reaffirm or reject third party representation.\n\nFor instance, the ERA guarantees a federally supervised secret ballot in all union certification elections. As it stands now, labor organizers are not required to provide one\u2014in almost 40 percent of union recognition \u201celections,\u201d they circumvent the democratic process with \u201ccard check\u201d procedures that deny employees a private vote and leave them vulnerable to union pressure tactics.\n\nYet union threats and bullying are not deemed criminal behavior. Under current labor law, union violence falls through a decades-old loophole which excuses Big Labor from prosecution if said violence is perpetrated to secure \u201clegitimate\u201d union objectives. Rectifying this injustice, the ERA would make all violence\u2014union-driven or not\u2014criminal behavior.\n\nWe don\u2019t live in the 1930s. American labor law shouldn\u2019t either.\n\nRaudabaugh is the Reed Larson Professor of Labor Law at Ave Maria University in Florida and, appointed by President George H.W.
