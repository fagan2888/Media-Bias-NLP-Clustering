Online reports.\n\n\n\nIn response to a user asking Mya if she was Jay's mistress, she wrote, \"Never did, never was, never will. Illegitimate, thirsty sources with no facts and that's the 'media' for you - especially today. I play second to no one, pay my own bills, have my own label, own management company, rely on God only and respect myself & marriage too much for nonsense.\"\n\n\n\nThe singer continued, \"False rumors are crafted for ratings & numbers. And miserable, unhappy people need someone to judge to deter the attention away from their own misery and feel better about their miserable lives. If they did it to Jesus, they'll do it to anyone. God bless.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe rumors began from a blind item posted online claiming that the 44-year-old rapper had a longtime relationship with a \"very short named R&B star who hasn't had a hit in awhile and doesn't really even act or record any longer.\"\n\n\n\n\"She basically lives off the generosity of Jay-Z and a couple of other guys,\" the post claimed.\n\n\n\nThe rumors of infidelity began after the Met Gala brawl Jay had with Beyonc\u00e9's sister, Solange Knowles. Beyonc\u00e9 added fuel to the rumors earlier this week when she changed the lyrics to her 2006 song \"Resentment\", ironically about infidelity, during her \"On the Run\" tour to reflect the number of years her and her hubby had been married.\n\n\n\nDespite heated rumors that the couple are headed for splitsville, Beyonc\u00e9 has taken to Instagram and her personal website to post adorable photos of the family relaxing and enjoying one another's company.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSIGN UP TO RECEIVE THE LATEST NEWS FROM FASHION&STYLE\n\n\u00a9 2015 Fashion & Style.com All rights reserved.
