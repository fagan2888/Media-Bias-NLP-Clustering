Marco Rubio arrives for a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing on Capitol Hill in Washington, regarding recent Iranian actions and implementation of the nuclear deal. (Photo: AP)\n\nFederal post lawsuit a joke?\n\nLet\u2019s see. A pro-Hillary group has filed suit claiming that Donald Trump promised Ben Carson a federal post in exchange for his endorsement. And this is somehow different from Barack Obama offering Hillary the secretary of state position in exchange for backing off in 2008 and endorsing him. Oh, I forgot \u2014 that appointment was in recognition of Hillary\u2019s \u201cexpertise\u201d that brought us Benghazi and assorted disasters around the world. Is this an April Fool\u2019s joke or what?\n\nRobert Werdann, Titusville\n\nBest, Brightest needs fix\n\nRecently local television featured an interview with two teachers \u2014 one who had received a Best and Brightest award and one who did not. The recipient was a second-year teacher and the other was a veteran secondary teacher with a master\u2019s degree. Curious to know how a teacher qualifies for the award, I downloaded a copy of the enabling legislation.\n\nThe measures used to determine the \u201c brightest\u201d were of particular interest to me. The \u201cLegislative Intent\u201d section emphasizes the importance of academic achievement:\n\n\u201c\u2026 research has linked student performance to a teacher\u2019s own academic achievements. Therefore ... (the Legislature shall) designate teachers who have achieved high academic standards during their own education as Florida\u2019s Best and Brightest Scholars.\u201d\n\nJudging candidates for this award, I assumed, should include achievements such as high class rankings, academic honors, advanced degrees and additional certifications. But the only measure of \u201cacademic achievement\u201d specified in the law is a score \u201c\u2026 at or above the 60th percentile on the ACT or SAT\u2026\u201d\n\nTeachers scoring below the magic percentile or who didn\u2019t take these exams (not used in over 850 colleges and universities) are excluded from consideration. At best, ACT / SAT scores are a very limited measure of pre-university academic success. Using them in determining the \u201cBest and the Brightest\u201d teachers is simply nonsense. If ever a piece of legislation needed revision, this one is it. For the teacher\u2019s sake, let us pray that someone up there (Tallahassee) is listening.\n\nThomas Grotelueschen, Cocoa Beach\n\nStudent union dollars a waste\n\nReally? $9.5 million for a student union at a college that is only open four days a week? How about staying open on Fridays, Eastern Florida State College, so your students can access labs, advisers and tutoring? Universities have big student unions because they have on-campus housing and services available on Saturdays, too. This is a waste of money and another poor decision on funding for Rick Scott.\n\nJodi Pierce, Merritt Island\n\nAnd he calls Trump naive?\n\nI listen with incredulity to our esteemed and all-knowing President Obama reacting to all the violations of the nuclear deal by the Iranians.\n\nHe seemed naively surprised, while at the same time trying to convince all the real foreign policy experts in Washington that actions ranging from ballistic missile tests to shipping weapons to terrorists in Yemen, aren\u2019t really violations. He seemed hurt that Iran isn\u2019t behaving in the \u201cspirit\u201d of the agreement.\n\nAmazing. He has the temerity to pompously call Donald Trump \u201cnaive on foreign policy.\u201d\n\nWilliam Alford, Palm Bay\n\nPay should reflect work done\n\nRegarding \u201cBrevard commissioners reject most citizen requests,\u201d (FLORIDA TODAY, April 2) Stockton Whitten owes Carol Walton an apology for his flippant dismissal of her idea.\n\nWalton proposed that county politicians\u2019 pay be based on how much time they actually spend at work. In other words, the same way it goes for anyone with a job.\n\nWhitten said we can\u2019t do that because \u201cit is up to each commissioner to decide\u201d how much time and effort is necessary for the job. Would that political doublespeak hold up anywhere else? \u201cI\u2019m sorry, boss, but I only felt like laying half of the bricks today. You\u2019ll be paying me in full, right?\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s nonsense. Remember: politicians work for us, not the other way around. They aren\u2019t exempt from common sense, and they shouldn\u2019t be paid if they\u2019re not doing their jobs\n\nNick Tomboulides, Suntree\n\nHike in prescription prices\n\nWow, has anyone had a prescription refilled in the last few days? I did. What was a $5 co-pay is now $72.99. I called every number I have (health plan provider, prescription provider, multiple pharmacies) and all gave me the same response. Thank you, Affordable Care Act, was the explanation.\n\nApparently, effective April 1, a new drug pricing, whatever, kicked in. More smoke and mirrors, or just another ploy to make national health care look more desirable? We don\u2019t need another government boondoggle. I was happy with the old school way of doing business at $5 per.\n\nTom McGee, Merritt Island\n\nIll-advised fertilizer tip\n\nI am shocked and saddened to read Sally Scalera\u2019s advice to gardeners in her April 2 FLORIDA TODAY article titled \u201cEnough prep, start planting and pruning this April.\u201d In it, she advises gardeners, \u201cApril is a good time to fertilize your lawn as it\u2019s the last time you\u2019ll be able to before the county-wide fertilizer bans take effect.\u201d\n\nHow irresponsible of Ms. Scalera to advise gardeners to rush out to fertilize their flowers before a fertilizer ban takes effect. Has she been reading the informative articles and photos that FLORIDA TODAY has printed? Has she looked at our brown rivers as she drives over our bridges? I hope most residents of Brevard County will ignore her advice. Avoiding the use of fertilizers is a small price to pay to help heal our rivers.\n\nBonnie Ewards, Merritt Island\n\nRead or Share this story: http://on.flatoday.com/1RWuFZH", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Letters and feedback: April 6, 2016", "og": {"site_name": "Florida Today", "description": "Letters and feedback: April 6, 2016", "title": "Letters and feedback: April 6, 2016", "url": "http://www.floridatoday.com/story/opinion/2016/04/05/letters-feedback-april/82654980/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/floridatoday.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Letters and feedback: April 6, 2016", "title": "Letters and feedback: April 6, 2016", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/889991accfb65b902d5990df9f583f48c5f31bb5/c=660-0-3912-3252&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2016/04/05/Brevard/B9321617708Z.1_20160405123840_000_GJGDVNTKH.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@Florida_Today", "site": "@Florida_Today", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=811359748", "fb": {"app_id": 133451750049911}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": "Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton, fertilizer, Eastern Florida State College, Iran nuclear deal, Brevard, Florida"}, "article_summary": "Has she been reading the informative articles and photos that FLORIDA TODAY has printed?\nUsing them in determining the \u201cBest and the Brightest\u201d teachers is simply nonsense.\nThe \u201cLegislative Intent\u201d section emphasizes the importance of academic achievement:\u201c\u2026 research has linked student performance to a teacher\u2019s own academic achievements.\nThe recipient was a second-year teacher and the other was a veteran secondary teacher with a master\u2019s degree.\nCurious to know how a teacher qualifies for the award, I downloaded a copy of the enabling legislation."}
