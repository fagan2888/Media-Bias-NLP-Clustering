Ted Cruz.\n\nFollowing the FAA\u2019s decision to extend the ban for a second day, the Texas Republican accused President Obama of using the federal agency to \u201claunch an economic boycott on Israel\u201d as the country fights a war against Hamas.\n\nAfter a rocket landed within a mile of Tel Aviv\u2019s airport Tuesday, the FAA prohibited U.S. flights from landing or taking off. Upon assessing the security situation in Israel late Wednesday night, the FAA said it had lifted the ban effective at 11:45 p.m. ET.\n\n\u201cPresident Obama has shown contempt for the Israeli government. He has been no friend to Israel.\u201d -@NileGardiner\n\nWhile the ban was in effect, Cruz asked the agency to respond to five questions about the ban, including any political discussions that may have taken place with the White House. He also asked why the FAA still was allowing flights over Ukraine in the wake of the Malaysian Airlines attack that killed 298 people last week.\n\n\u201cThe facts suggest that President Obama has just used a federal regulatory agency to launch an economic boycott on Israel, in order to try to force our ally to comply with his foreign-policy demands,\u201d Cruz said.\n\nCruz\u2019s five questions prompted an angry response from the State Department later in the day. \u201cIt\u2019s ridiculous and offensive, quite frankly,\u201d spokeswoman Marie Harf said.\n\nRebuffed, Cruz is now threatening to block all State Department nominees until his questions are answered. He said:\n\nSerious questions were asked about the nature of a decision that handed Hamas a public relations victory and could have cost Israel billions of dollars. The only thing \u2018offensive\u2019 about this situation is how the Obama Administration is spurning our allies to embolden our enemies; the only thing \u2018ridiculous\u2019 is the administration\u2019s response to basic questions.\n\nThe Heritage Foundation\u2019s Nile Gardiner said Hamas views the flight ban as \u201cbig victory\u201d because it leaves Israel increasingly isolated. Gardiner, who considers Obama to have contempt for Israel, said Cruz was right to question the decision.\n\n>>> Q&A: What Is This Iron Dome That Is Protecting Israel From Hamas Rockets?\n\n\u201cFar too often, the Obama administration behaves as an imperial presidency when anyone questions its authority,\u201d said Gardiner, who directs Heritage\u2019s Margaret Thatcher Center for Freedom. \u201cPresident Obama has shown contempt for the Israeli government. He has been no friend to Israel.\u201d\n\nCruz wasn\u2019t the only politician to voice alarm at the Obama administration\u2019s actions Wednesday.
