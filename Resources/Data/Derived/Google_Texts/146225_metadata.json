This ought to embarrass Democrats coast to coast \u2014 in Hollywood, in the news media, in academia, etc. Are they embarrassed? If not, why not?\n\nI heard John Derbyshire quote someone once \u2014 I think it was Mick Jagger. Some rockers had trashed a hotel room or something, and Mick was asked whether they were embarrassed. He answered, \u201cThey don\u2019t embarrass easy.\u201d\n\nIn our latest podcast, Mona Charen and I have a special guest: Richard Pipes, the historian of Russia. There are few so equipped to comment on the present situation in Ukraine. Pipes has lived an extraordinary life, which he chronicles in his memoirs, Vixi. (The title is Latin for \u201cI have lived.\u201d) I reviewed this book when it came out, in 2003: Go here. I would like to cite two of my favorite tidbits about Pipes.\n\nHe was a national-security official in the White House in 1982, when Brezhnev died. It fell to him to go to the Soviet embassy, where he was asked to sign the condolence book. He was torn: He hated Brezhnev and Communism, but he was there in an official capacity. Thinking fast, he hit on a solution: He signed his name, but completely illegibly.\n\nFor my second \u201ctidbit,\u201d I\u2019d like to quote the last two paragraphs of that 2003 review:\n\nAt the dawn of 2000, we [National Review] published our \u201cmillennium issue,\u201d consisting of big-think pieces by big thinkers, including Pipes. In his essay, Pipes cited a book by Henri Frankfort, Kingship and the Gods (on ancient Near Eastern religion and society). He had the g in \u201cgods\u201d down \u2014 in the lower case \u2014 but, as it was in the title, I, of course, as editor, put it up. He insisted on its being put back down. \u201cI am a Jew,\u201d he said, \u201cand there is one God, and I will not have the plural word capitalized.\u201d \u201cBut Professor Pipes,\u201d I pleaded, \u201cI am as monotheistic as anyone, but this is a matter of style, and to have the word up doesn\u2019t imply any idolatry: It\u2019s just a word in a title, like \u2018table\u2019 or \u2018chair.\u2019\u201d No, no, said Pipes, it could not be up, title or not. So, that\u2019s how it appeared in the magazine: Kingship and the gods. It looked weird, and wrong (because it was weird, and wrong) \u2014 but, in the Pipesian world, it was really wonderful, and right.\n\nJust one more thing, a third \u201ctidbit\u201d: Pipes, age 16, laid eyes on Hitler. The Nazis had invaded Poland, and Hitler had come to Warsaw, Pipes\u2019s hometown, to take a victory lap. \u201cHe rode in an open Mercedes, standing up in the familiar pose, giving the Nazi salute,\u201d writes Pipes in his memoirs. \u201cI thought how easy it would be to assassinate him.\u201d\n\nCare for a Minneapolis journal \u2014 a short one? I was in that city over the weekend \u2014 St. Paul, too, I suppose (sometimes it\u2019s hard to tell) \u2014 and I have some notes for you. Just a few.\n\nFor example: Someone told me that, to reach my destination, I needed to cross the river. So I headed for what I thought was the right bridge. As I neared it, I thought, \u201cNo, that\u2019s not a bridge over the river. It\u2019s over a big parking lot or something like that.\u201d\n\nBut I had forgotten \u2014 forgotten that the river was frozen solid. I was looking for something that flowed. This was very different.\n\nWalking around the University of Minnesota campus, I came upon the football stadium \u2014 which features the school colors, maroon and gold. These are some of the best school colors anywhere, I think: distinctive, attractive.\n\nI\u2019ve written about this before: The University of Michigan, in my hometown of Ann Arbor? Our colors are supposed to be maize and blue. But, in recent years, those colors have been bright, neon yellow and blue. Yuck, blech.\n\nI walk past the \u201cPeople\u2019s Center Medical Service.\u201d (I may have the name slightly off.) This gives me a memory. Years ago, when I lived in Washington, D.C., we had a chain of stores called People\u2019s Drugs. A visitor remarked, \u201cIsn\u2019t that sort of, like, commie?\u201d\n\nI see a castle \u2014 it looks like a real-live, bona-fide castle. Turns out to be the University of Minnesota Armory.\n\nLots of kids are walking around with skis \u2014 I mean, carrying them, in a case. I see one guy in shorts. It\u2019s 28 degrees. That\u2019s warmer than it has been here in a long time (I\u2019m told).\n\nOn the fa\u00e7ade of Hillel, there are banners: \u201cShalom.\u201d \u201cCome to Hillel, even though your mother told you to.\u201d\n\nNext to Hillel is Baldy\u2019s BBQ: \u201cAre you ready for some BBQ?\u201d I have a standing answer to that question. (It\u2019s not no.)\n\nI see the Bell Museum of Natural History. I think, \u201cShouldn\u2019t that be a museum of maybe technical history?\u201d (\u201cBell\u201d puts me in mind of Alexander Graham.)\n\nThe university has a current slogan, apparently: \u201cDriven to discover.\u201d You can see that on little banners. As I was writing recently, there is something about the human ear that likes alliteration. This is responsible for the success of that disgusting, slanderous expression \u201cwar on women.\u201d\n\nI have seen the name Kaufman spelled several ways. I have never, until now, seen it spelled \u201cCoffman\u201d \u2014 as in the Coffman Memorial Union.\n\nCare for a language note? Or, another one, rather? I\u2019ve noticed that people in the Twin Cities use the word \u201cperfect\u201d \u2014 \u201cperfect\u201d meaning \u201cfine,\u201d \u201cokay,\u201d \u201cnice,\u201d \u201cgot it.\u201d \u201cMeet you at the Mary Tyler Moore statue at 3:30?\u201d \u201cPerfect.\u201d \u201cI thought I\u2019d have a bite to eat then give you a call, okay?\u201d \u201cPerfect.\u201d\n\nSpeaking of perfection: It\u2019s always a pleasure to see Scott and Sally Johnson. Scott is the Power Line star, and Sally is a star in her own right: known for her cooking, for one thing. She happens to be a native of Lima \u2014 Peru, not Ohio (and I can testify from recent experience how good the cooking in the Peruvian capital is). Sally is a lawyer and professor. She and Scott are the parents of Eliana Johnson, NR\u2019s own. There are notable others in the family, too \u2014 including a violinist.\n\nMinnesota is known for \u201cnice.\u201d But I doubt that anyone in this state can out-nice the Johnsons.\n\nAugsburg College is right across from the U of M campus. I speak with the president, Paul Pribbenow, and what he says is music to my ears: He likes to bring diversity to campus \u2014 a diversity of views, a diversity of thought. That\u2019s the kind of diversity a college should aim for, in my opinion. The rest is mainly superficial.\n\nI have come to participate in the Nobel Peace Prize Forum, held at Augsburg. (It takes place in a rotation of colleges, I understand.) The forum is directed by Maureen Reed \u2014 another stellar person, who ought to be a college president herself, in my opinion. It\u2019s amazingly reassuring to find quality people in key positions.\n\nIn the airport, before I leave, I have what one ought to have, \u201cwhen in Rome\u201d: a walleye sandwich \u2014 blackened.\n\nOn the plane is a prominent Minnesotan, Tim Pawlenty, the ex-governor. He ran for president in 2012. He would have been good. He seems very fit, and relaxed, and patient \u2014 with the fellow passengers talking to him. He also seems very young for an ex-governor. An ex two-term governor, at that.\n\nLet\u2019s have a little reader mail. The other day, I was writing about environmental alarums. I grew up during the coming ice age \u2014 there would be cross-country skiing in Miami. I also grew up during the population explosion, or \u201cpopulation bomb.\u201d This would cause massive starvation. So, now we\u2019re having global warming, which is supposed to be the ruin of us all. I may be wrong, but I just can\u2019t get all that worked up \u2014 having heard wolf cried several times before.\n\nA reader says,\n\nI can still clearly remember standing at the school bus stop one morning in a freezing rain (an Ohio specialty) when I was twelve years old discussing with the guys an article that had just appeared in the Dayton Daily News reporting that the earth had been cooling since 1950. Global cooling was apparently \u201csettled science\u201d in 1966. The only questions we had were whether anyone would still live in Dayton when it was as cold as the North Pole and whether anyone would still want to live in Florida when it had a climate like Dayton\u2019s. I would say that our discussion then was about as intelligent and fact-based as most climate-change discussions today.\n\nA little music? For a review of Sweeney Todd, performed under the auspices of the New York Philharmonic, go here.\n\nEnd on a joke? Okay.

This ought to embarrass Democrats coast to coast \u2014 in Hollywood, in the news media, in academia, etc. Are they embarrassed? If not, why not?\n\nI heard John Derbyshire quote someone once \u2014 I think it was Mick Jagger. Some rockers had trashed a hotel room or something, and Mick was asked whether they were embarrassed. He answered, \u201cThey don\u2019t embarrass easy.\u201d\n\n#ad#In our latest podcast, Mona Charen and I have a special guest: Richard Pipes, the historian of Russia. There are few so equipped to comment on the present situation in Ukraine. Pipes has lived an extraordinary life, which he chronicles in his memoirs, Vixi. (The title is Latin for \u201cI have lived.\u201d) I reviewed this book when it came out, in 2003: Go here. I would like to cite two of my favorite tidbits about Pipes.\n\nHe was a national-security official in the White House in 1982, when Brezhnev died. It fell to him to go to the Soviet embassy, where he was asked to sign the condolence book. He was torn: He hated Brezhnev and Communism, but he was there in an official capacity. Thinking fast, he hit on a solution: He signed his name, but completely illegibly.\n\nFor my second \u201ctidbit,\u201d I\u2019d like to quote the last two paragraphs of that 2003 review:\n\n\nAt the dawn of 2000, we [National Review] published our \u201cmillennium issue,\u201d consisting of big-think pieces by big thinkers, including Pipes. In his essay, Pipes cited a book by Henri Frankfort, Kingship and the Gods (on ancient Near Eastern religion and society). He had the g in \u201cgods\u201d down \u2014 in the lower case \u2014 but, as it was in the title, I, of course, as editor, put it up. He insisted on its being put back down. \u201cI am a Jew,\u201d he said, \u201cand there is one God, and I will not have the plural word capitalized.\u201d \u201cBut Professor Pipes,\u201d I pleaded, \u201cI am as monotheistic as anyone, but this is a matter of style, and to have the word up doesn\u2019t imply any idolatry: It\u2019s just a word in a title, like \u2018table\u2019 or \u2018chair.\u2019\u201d No, no, said Pipes, it could not be up, title or not.\n\nSo, that\u2019s how it appeared in the magazine: Kingship and the gods. It looked weird, and wrong (because it was weird, and wrong) \u2014 but, in the Pipesian world, it was really wonderful, and right.\n\n\nJust one more thing, a third \u201ctidbit\u201d: Pipes, age 16, laid eyes on Hitler. The Nazis had invaded Poland, and Hitler had come to Warsaw, Pipes\u2019s hometown, to take a victory lap. \u201cHe rode in an open Mercedes, standing up in the familiar pose, giving the Nazi salute,\u201d writes Pipes in his memoirs. \u201cI thought how easy it would be to assassinate him.\u201d\n\nCare for a Minneapolis journal \u2014 a short one? I was in that city over the weekend \u2014 St. Paul, too, I suppose (sometimes it\u2019s hard to tell) \u2014 and I have some notes for you. Just a few.\n\nFor example: Someone told me that, to reach my destination, I needed to cross the river. So I headed for what I thought was the right bridge. As I neared it, I thought, \u201cNo, that\u2019s not a bridge over the river. It\u2019s over a big parking lot or something like that.\u201d\n\nBut I had forgotten \u2014 forgotten that the river was frozen solid. I was looking for something that flowed. This was very different.\n\nWalking around the University of Minnesota campus, I came upon the football stadium \u2014 which features the school colors, maroon and gold. These are some of the best school colors anywhere, I think: distinctive, attractive.\n\nI\u2019ve written about this before: The University of Michigan, in my hometown of Ann Arbor? Our colors are supposed to be maize and blue. But, in recent years, those colors have been bright, neon yellow and blue. Yuck, blech.\n\nI walk past the \u201cPeople\u2019s Center Medical Service.\u201d (I may have the name slightly off.) This gives me a memory. Years ago, when I lived in Washington, D.C., we had a chain of stores called People\u2019s Drugs. A visitor remarked, \u201cIsn\u2019t that sort of, like, commie?\u201d\n\nI see a castle \u2014 it looks like a real-live, bona-fide castle. Turns out to be the University of Minnesota Armory.\n\nLots of kids are walking around with skis \u2014 I mean, carrying them, in a case. I see one guy in shorts. It\u2019s 28 degrees. That\u2019s warmer than it has been here in a long time (I\u2019m told).\n\nOn the fa\u00e7ade of Hillel, there are banners: \u201cShalom.\u201d \u201cCome to Hillel, even though your mother told you to.\u201d\n\nNext to Hillel is Baldy\u2019s BBQ: \u201cAre you ready for some BBQ?\u201d I have a standing answer to that question. (It\u2019s not no.)\n\n#page#I see the Bell Museum of Natural History. I think, \u201cShouldn\u2019t that be a museum of maybe technical history?\u201d (\u201cBell\u201d puts me in mind of Alexander Graham.)\n\nThe university has a current slogan, apparently: \u201cDriven to discover.\u201d You can see that on little banners. As I was writing recently, there is something about the human ear that likes alliteration. This is responsible for the success of that disgusting, slanderous expression \u201cwar on women.\u201d\n\nI have seen the name Kaufman spelled several ways. I have never, until now, seen it spelled \u201cCoffman\u201d \u2014 as in the Coffman Memorial Union.\n\nCare for a language note? Or, another one, rather? I\u2019ve noticed that people in the Twin Cities use the word \u201cperfect\u201d \u2014 \u201cperfect\u201d meaning \u201cfine,\u201d \u201cokay,\u201d \u201cnice,\u201d \u201cgot it.\u201d \u201cMeet you at the Mary Tyler Moore statue at 3:30?\u201d \u201cPerfect.\u201d \u201cI thought I\u2019d have a bite to eat then give you a call, okay?\u201d \u201cPerfect.\u201d\n\n#ad#Speaking of perfection: It\u2019s always a pleasure to see Scott and Sally Johnson. Scott is the Power Line star, and Sally is a star in her own right: known for her cooking, for one thing. She happens to be a native of Lima \u2014 Peru, not Ohio (and I can testify from recent experience how good the cooking in the Peruvian capital is). Sally is a lawyer and professor. She and Scott are the parents of Eliana Johnson, NR\u2019s own. There are notable others in the family, too \u2014 including a violinist.\n\nMinnesota is known for \u201cnice.\u201d But I doubt that anyone in this state can out-nice the Johnsons.\n\nAugsburg College is right across from the U of M campus. I speak with the president, Paul Pribbenow, and what he says is music to my ears: He likes to bring diversity to campus \u2014 a diversity of views, a diversity of thought. That\u2019s the kind of diversity a college should aim for, in my opinion. The rest is mainly superficial.\n\nI have come to participate in the Nobel Peace Prize Forum, held at Augsburg. (It takes place in a rotation of colleges, I understand.) The forum is directed by Maureen Reed \u2014 another stellar person, who ought to be a college president herself, in my opinion.

He ran for president in 2012. He would have been good. He seems very fit, and relaxed, and patient \u2014 with the fellow passengers talking to him. He also seems very young for an ex-governor.
