Scott Walker

The lesson: Don’t carry high-interest credit card debt.

The Wisconsin governor is paying 27.24 percent interest on a Barclays credit card with an outstanding balance of $10,000 to $15,000 on it. That’s nearly twice the current average credit card rate of 15 percent. If he can’t pay it off immediately from his $144,000 salary, Walker should consider transferring the debt to a card that offers a 0 percent balance transfer and then focus on paying it off within the 12-to-18-month promotional period.
