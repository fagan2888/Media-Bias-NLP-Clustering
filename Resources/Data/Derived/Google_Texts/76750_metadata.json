It submitted a filing requesting a 9.4% rate increase for its 6,900 members, according to ObamaCare enrollment tracker ACASignups.net.\n\nOverall, the average weighted premium-hike request appears to be 17.9%, says Charles Gaba of ACASignups.\n\nThe rate increases may turn out to be quite small for those who qualify for subsidies. The average premium hike for the subsidized population was just 4% in 2016, the Obama administration said on Tuesday.\n\nConsumers may be able to switch to cheaper plans, which might also hold down their premium increases. But all of the carriers except for UnitedHealth appear to be seeking double-digit increases in Virginia. A couple of carriers with a combined 40,000 customers, CareFirst BlueChoice and Optima Health, are seeking rate increases in excess of 30%.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The first ObamaCare requests for 2017 premium hikes are now being filed and the initial news looks bad \u2014 at least in Virginia.", "og": {"site_name": "Investor's Business Daily", "description": "The first ObamaCare requests for 2017 premium hikes are now being filed and the initial news looks bad\u00a0\u2014 at least in Virginia.
