Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat. AFL-CIO plans to hold similar events in Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina in the coming months.\n\nTo bolster the summit\u2019s call for higher minimum wage mandates and more government spending, AFL-CIO let several members of its affiliate unions speak. American Federation of Teachers President Randi Weingarten, who was paid $557,875 taken from teachers last year, shared a photo of herself with a speaker from the Detroit Federation of Teachers.\n\nDetroit educator Lakia Wilson talks abt struggles of making ends meet on educator salary #raisingwages pic.twitter.com/ziLbOUCbH6 \u2014 Randi Weingarten (@rweingarten) January 7, 2015\n\n\u201cYou follow in the best traditions of the American labor movement for more than a century, always fighting for working people union and non-union,\u201d Warren told the crowd during her speech bemoaning insufficient redistribution of wealth.\n\nWarren criticized tax cuts, and called for more federal spending although America\u2019s national debt has increased by more than $7 trillion \u2014 more than $1 billion every seven hours \u2014 since President Obama took office six years ago.\n\n\u201cTrickle-down had a second part to it, and that is cut taxes for those at the top: cut them when times are good, cut them when times are bad,\u201d Warren said. \u201cAnd when that meant there was less money for road repairs, less money for medical research, and less money for schools, and that our government would need to squeeze kids on student loans, trickle-down advocates said, \u2018So be it.'\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd look at the result,\u201d she continued. \u201cThe top 10 percent got all the growth in income over the past 30 years. All of it. And the economy stopped working for everyone else.\u201d America\u2019s corporate income tax rate is among the highest in the world.\n\nWarren lives in a 3,700-square-foot home worth approximately $2.4 million, leftist news outlet PolitiFact explained in an October column. She and her husband estimated their net worth at $14.5 million on a 2012 financial disclosure form.\n\nAFL-CIO bosses loved Warren\u2019s speech, calling it \u201camazing.\u201d AFL-CIO also applauded Perez, the top labor official in the Obama administration, for his \u201camazing\u201d speech.\n\nPerez called for a federal minimum wage hike, a message the Department of Labor shared using AFL-CIO\u2019s Twitter hashtag for the event.\n\n\"20 states saw an increase in minimum wage but you shouldn't have to win the geographic lottery to be prosperous.\" \u2013@LaborSec #RaisingWages \u2014 US Labor Department (@USDOL) January 7, 2015\n\nAFL-CIO quickly turned another quote from Perez\u2019s speech into a union recruiting graphic.\n\nThe words 'collective bargaining' mean we can work for our collective good \u2013 @LaborSec today at #RaisingWages Summit pic.twitter.com/35zvoZIR0Q \u2014 AFL-CIO (@AFLCIO) January 8, 2015\n\nTrumka, meanwhile, called Perez a \u201c(g)reat leader and friend\u201d in one of several posts promoting the Raising Wages Summit. Trumka was paid $322,131 taken from workers last year, but called on workers to show solidarity with AFL-CIO.\n\nWe have to organize around a common purpose. That's what #RaisingWages is all about. \u2014 Richard L. Trumka (@RichardTrumka) January 7, 2015\n\nFamilies do NOT need to hear more about income inequality. They need more income \u2013@RichardTrumka #RaisingWages \u2014 AFL-CIO (@AFLCIO) January 7, 2015\n\nTrumka also told summit attendees to support union organizing campaigns Fight for 15 and Organization United for Respect at Walmart.\n\nWant to see us on Election Day?

The solution to this problem, EPI suggested, is increased unionization.\n\nStrengthening collective bargaining will grow wages. http://t.co/aYXNlwVker #raisingwages pic.twitter.com/MG23i0vgXd \u2014 Economic Policy Inst (@EconomicPolicy) January 7, 2015\n\nUnions use EPI research in fights for bigger government and against labor reform.
