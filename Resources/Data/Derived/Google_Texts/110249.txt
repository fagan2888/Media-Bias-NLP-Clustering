Amid all the other economic news, the CBO has issued its latest budget projections. According to the projections, the US deficit will soon stop shrinking and begin to rise again. Cue the Very Serious People, who are deeply distressed at the failure of the promised fiscal crisis to materialize; I’m sure we’ll see editorials and op-eds in the next few days warning us that the deficit is still public enemy #1.

But as Matt Klein points out — and as I pointed out around a year ago, after a similar CBO projection — there’s a funny thing about that projected rise in the deficit: it’s not about rising entitlement spending or any of the usual things the VSPs want to cut. It’s based on an assumption that interest payments will rise.

Well, you might say, that makes sense — as debt rises, so do interest payments. Isn’t this about that debt spiral?

Well, no. CBO shows the ratio of debt to GDP barely rising; just about all the rise in payments comes from an assumption that interest rates will rise. And as both Klein and I have tried to explain, we don’t really know that; there’s a plausible case that it’s wrong.

I’m not attacking CBO, which needs to make some kind of rate assumption. But if you read someone trying to resurrect deficit panic, bear in mind that even the modest rise in the new projections is just an assumption, with nothing solid behind it.

Oh, and in other news: It appears that Obamacare is coming in 20 percent cheaper than originally projected.
