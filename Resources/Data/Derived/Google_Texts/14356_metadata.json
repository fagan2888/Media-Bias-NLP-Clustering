It\u2019s not the divide between conservatives and moderates. Nor does it involve who\u2019s right about how to cut taxes, supply-siders or reform conservatives. This rift is bigger. It\u2019s between Republican leaders in Congress and the Republican grassroots.\n\nIt\u2019s manifested itself in numerous ways. The drive to oust, or at least embarrass, Speaker John Boehner is one. That effort led to 25 House Republicans opposing Boehner for speaker in January. That\u2019s just a tenth of the GOP caucus\u2014246 strong\u2014but was enough to threaten Boehner\u2019s majority in the House since every Democrat voted against him.\n\nAnother example: the primary defeat last year of House majority leader Eric Cantor of Virginia. The victor was David Brat, an economics professor at Randolph-Macon College who\u2019d never won elective office. Brat is now close to a loose group of 20 or so dissident House Republicans, dubbed \u201cchuckleheads\u201d by former Republican congressman Steve LaTourette of Ohio.\n\nThen there\u2019s the constant refrain one hears from Republican activists around the country, particularly the Tea Party ones. They\u2019re often as critical of Boehner and Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell as they are of President Obama. Or so it seems. Conservative talk radio amplifies their criticism.\n\nWhat\u2019s their beef? It\u2019s that Boehner and McConnell would rather compromise or yield than fight for conservative causes against Obama and congressional Democrats. Grassroots Republicans prefer outspoken fighters like Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, even if the cause is lost or prompts a politically harmful exercise such as a government shutdown.\n\nThat a gap exists between GOP leaders in Congress and Republicans outside Washington is hardly a secret. Now a step has been taken, with more to come, to narrow that gap. It consisted of 30 minutes of Q&A last week between McConnell and directors of center-right think tanks at the state level. Also invited were officials of national think tanks: the Cato Institute, American Enterprise Institute, Heritage Foundation, Manhattan Institute, and Heartland Institute.\n\nA conference call may not sound like much, but it\u2019s a start. McConnell has agreed to answer their questions every three months. Boehner, whose first session will come in a few weeks, has agreed to the same quarterly schedule.\n\nThe idea for this connection comes from Grover Norquist, the head of Americans for Tax Reform. He\u2019s been discussing the idea with McConnell and Boehner for months. He read the questions submitted by what he calls conservative \u201copinion leaders\u201d to McConnell. More than 120 people joined the call.\n\nThe goal is for GOP leaders in Washington to explain what they\u2019re doing to influential conservatives around the country. \u201cThey haven\u2019t explained well enough,\u201d Norquist said. \u201cThat\u2019s a connection that hasn\u2019t been happening and needs to.\u201d It creates \u201cthe opportunity for better cooperation.\u201d\n\nMuch of what reaches conservatives and Republicans in the states has been \u201cfiltered through certain groups that have different agendas,\u201d Norquist told me. \u201cIt\u2019s useful to get it from the horse\u2019s mouth.\u201d\n\nIn last week\u2019s session, McConnell answered all but one question. That question was about how Republicans on Capitol Hill will respond if the Supreme Court bars federal Obamacare exchanges from giving subsidies to individuals to help pay the cost of health insurance. That\u2019s being studied, McConnell said. But \u201cwe\u2019ll be prepared to act.\u201d\n\nMcConnell seized the opportunity to explain how he\u2019s uprooted the way Democratic leader Harry Reid ran the Senate. This year, Republicans passed a budget. That hadn\u2019t occurred in the previous five years under Reid. \u201cThe Senate is up and running again,\u201d McConnell said.\n\nReid allowed few amendments to protect Democrats from having to cast a vote on controversial issues. Under Reid, there were just 15 votes on amendments in 2014. This year, there have been more than 100. \u201cIf you\u2019re afraid of tough votes, you ought to go into another line of work,\u201d McConnell said.\n\nOn issue after issue, McConnell said where Senate Republicans stand. Prospects for patent reform are \u201cpretty good.\u201d Legislation to ban abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy is \u201con our agenda to be brought up,\u201d having already passed the House. Tax reform \u201cneeds a new president,\u201d McConnell said. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty obvious this president is not Ronald Reagan. . . . Barack Obama is not going to the center. . . . [He\u2019s] far left.\u201d Reagan engineered sweeping tax reform, with an assist from Democrats like Sen. Bill Bradley, in 1986.\n\nMcConnell said Republicans can invoke \u201creconciliation\u201d to repeal parts but not all of Obamacare. That means a simple majority rather than 60 votes is required, thus thwarting any Democratic plan to filibuster. Republicans control the Senate 54-46. But the president is sure to veto bills passed through reconciliation. \u201cHe\u2019s not going to sign anything that only Republicans\u201d have voted for.\n\nIn the 2016 election, Republicans won\u2019t get to 60 seats to overcome filibusters, according to McConnell. The open Florida seat, he noted, is \u201cquite competitive.\u201d Incumbent Marco Rubio is retiring to run for the Republican presidential nomination. Republicans have an opportunity to win Democratic seats in Nevada and Colorado, McConnell said.\n\nHe revealed the tentative campaign slogan for next year: \u201cDo you want four more years of the last eight years?\u201d In Washington and beyond, Republicans agree the answer is no.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Fred Barnes,House GOP,Mitch McConnell", "og": {"site_name": "Weekly Standard", "description": "&nbsp;\nAt long last one of the nastiest rifts in the Republican party is being dealt with.
