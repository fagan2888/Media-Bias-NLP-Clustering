They want the hospitals to bid against each other, publicly, for the care delivered to 80,000 municipal employees and their families.\n\nMany companies are changing the health insurance deal with their workers by charging lower premiums for those who quit smoking or pass screenings for high blood pressure, diabetes and artery-clogging cholesterol.\n\nA community-wide campaign is underway in Fort Worth to change the lifestyle choices that cause most chronic illnesses, while Dallas and other cities are also working on weight loss and exercise programs.\n\nThe sweep of change is evident in many other parts of the country. The debate over federal budget deficits is largely about rising health care costs. Both Republicans and Democrats have sought ways to stem the tide by taming inflation in Medicare prices.\n\nCalifornia\u2019s biggest pension fund has set price ceilings for some surgeries \u2014 and hospitals have quickly fallen in line.\n\nIn Wisconsin, \u201cexasperated private payers, led by large and medium employers, are staging a revolt\u201d against the medical establishment, said John Torinus, chairman of Milwaukee manufacturer Serigraph and author of The Grassroots Health Care Revolution. \u201cNo other vendor would get away with double-digit increases for decades.\u201d\n\nNearly 17 million people now have health insurance under the 2010 Affordable Care Act \u2014 insurance they could not afford or, in some cases, didn\u2019t want before the law passed.\n\nPace of change\n\n\u201cI will tell you that the pace of change is incredible,\u201d said Brian Dickerson, Fort Worth\u2019s human resources director and a former health insurance executive. \u201cIt\u2019s moving so far and so fast, we have more solutions than there are questions.\u201d\n\nDickerson\u2019s comments suggest not all of this change may succeed. Baylor Scott & White turned aside the cities\u2019 request for bids indexed to Medicare pricing. The Affordable Care Act remains unpopular with millions of Americans, and Republicans continue to seek its repeal.\n\nBehind all this churn, however, is a shared belief that health care costs too much and too often fails to deliver.\n\nRoughly a third of the nation\u2019s $3.1 trillion health care bill is wasted on unnecessary or incorrect services, according to studies by the McKinsey Global Institute, the Dartmouth Institute for Health Policy and Clinical Practice and a 2012 examination led by Don Berwick, a physician and former director of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services.\n\n\u201cBerwick\u2019s right,\u201d said Gary Brock, president of the North Texas operations of Baylor Scott & White. \u201cWe\u2019ve created a collaborative structure that\u2019s focused on strategies eliminating the waste that Berwick talked about.\u201d\n\nCare coordination among hospitals, physicians, nurses, therapists and home health care agencies is key to Baylor\u2019s strategy. Dickerson noted, however, that not all of Baylor\u2019s caregivers are equal in ability. Choosing a doctor can be harder when care in a coordinated chain requires patients to see whomever the health group assigns.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve poured all your doctors into this, but where\u2019s the quality?\u201d Dickerson said he told Baylor executives. \u201cYou know you have some doctors that are good, some that are great, and some that are not either one.\u201d\n\nThere is a lot of misdiagnosis in that wasted spending, Dickerson said. Patients and employers should still be able to choose their physicians, or, expect Baylor and other providers to weed out the worst performers.\n\nMunicipal rebellion\n\nThe municipal rebellion against hospital prices was ignited by recent increases averaging 9 percent to 9.5 percent a year, according to an analysis by Dallas consultants Holmes Murphy.\n\nLast March, Den Bishop, president of the consulting firm, began encouraging the cities to unite to confront these prices. Instead of relying on insurance companies to bargain with hospitals, he said, they should do it themselves and insist that the hospitals use a single index as their starting point.\n\nBishop argues that the only way to get control of medical spending is to peg it to Medicare\u2019s fixed prices. \u201cThe system will not stabilize until we get to that place,\u201d he said.\n\nMedicare, the federal health insurance program for seniors and the disabled, sets prices annually for hospital and physician services. Caregivers have long complained that these prices are too low and don\u2019t even reflect their costs.\n\nBut both Baylor and Texas Health Resources, another large hospital chain in North Texas, are striving to reach a break-even point between costs and prices in treating Medicare patients.\n\nCoaxing the cities into what\u2019s called the North Texas Coalition required convincing their benefit managers that a Medicare index would work. Until now, they have not had the ability to compare prices among hospitals.\n\nEvery hospital uses a different formula of retail prices for procedures; the only thing they have in common is that the prices are far higher than what the hospitals collect.\n\nBarclay Berdan, CEO of Texas Health Resources, said he hopes a more rational price list \u2014 \u201csomething where the charges are more reflective of revenue we actually expect to get\u201d \u2014 will be developed by the end of 2016.\n\n\u201cWith most hospitals nowadays \u2026 what you actually get paid or collect of the gross charges is about 25 to 45 cents on the dollar,\u201d he said. \u201cForty-five cents would be very good, 25 cents would be on the low side. I would guess our average \u2026 right now is about 32 to 33 percent.\u201d\n\nInstead of bargaining for discounts off these inflated retail price lists, Bishop urged the cities to demand that hospitals start with Medicare prices. These are roughly uniform across the Dallas-Fort Worth area.\n\nBishop put it this way: \u201cAt what percent of Medicare are you willing to sell your services?\u201d\n\nUnited front\n\nBy early December, the cities were prepared to fight on a united front.\n\nMolly Carroll, Dallas\u2019 director of human resources, said something has to give in negotiations with the hospitals. \u201cThe city is only going to be able to do so much,\u201d she said. \u201cAt some point, we\u2019re going to be cannibalizing our services for health care.\u201d\n\nBaylor\u2019s Brock turned aside the municipal coalition\u2019s bid request and said the cities should talk with his hospital group about Baylor\u2019s new care model. Under that approach, employers would pay Baylor an annual fee for each worker. If Baylor kept most of them well and out of the hospital, it would make money. More illness would require Baylor to take a loss.\n\nThe starting line for this approach, however, is an expensive one. Hospital prices in Dallas \u2014 the real prices that are paid by insurers \u2014 are among the highest in the country. Last year, they were 14 percent above the national average, according to a September analysis by the Health Care Cost Institute, a Washington think tank.\n\n\u201cThe story for Dallas really seems to be the price level,\u201d said Eric Burette, the lead author of the study. \u201cIt\u2019s not what patients and employers want to see in an area.\u201d\n\nBishop blames employers for not standing up to the health care industry.\n\n\u201cI tell them, \u2018Shame on you for being willing to pay this,\u2019\u201d Bishop said. \u201cYou haven\u2019t cared that you\u2019ve had high inflation. You just absorbed some of it and passed the rest to your employees.\u201d\n\nBusiness community\n\nSurprisingly, Brock agrees. Asked about the Health Care Cost Institute\u2019s findings, he, too, said the Dallas business community has preferred to include all hospitals in their insurance plans rather than seek lower prices.\n\n\u201cEmployers haven\u2019t really been focusing on a more narrow band of providers and being able to use their relationships with those providers to drive their cost of care down,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s starting to happen.\u201d\n\nTorinus, the Milwaukee manufacturer and author, sees employers standing up all across the country.\n\n\u201cFirst, they are becoming self-insured,\u201d he said. \u201cThey bear the insurance risk, not the insurance company. Second, they\u2019re pushing their employees into consumer-driven health plans with high deductibles, but also, for most of them, with health savings accounts.\n\n\u201cThat gets you to the 30-yard line,\u201d he said. \u201cNext is when the companies open onsite clinics, staffed by their own physicians, to make it easy for their employees to get the preventive care they need.\u201d\n\nNearly 30 percent of the nation\u2019s companies employing 5,000 or more workers now have such clinics, he said.\n\n\u201cCompanies in the vanguard of containing health costs do it by managing health. In the process, they are enjoying improved productivity, higher morale, less absenteeism, and lower workers\u2019 compensation charges,\u201d Torinus said.\n\nDallas residents who get their health insurance at work have seen a lot of their companies\u2019 health costs shifted to them in the last few years. The average Texas worker spent 12.3 percent of income on health insurance in 2013, a larger share for coverage than almost anyone else in the nation, according to a report by the Commonwealth Fund, a health policy think tank in New York.\n\nHigh deductibles mean consumers pay thousands of dollars for their own care before their insurance kicks in. Often, the result is delayed care. It\u2019s hard for consumers to know where to get the best value for their money, because health care is that rare purchase where the cost can\u2019t be discovered beforehand.\n\nCosts of procedures\n\nThis, too, is beginning to change. The Health Care Cost Institute, using claims records from several large health insurance firms, runs a website called Guroo.com that provides average costs by metropolitan area for hundreds of medical procedures.\n\nThe national average for a colonoscopy screening is $2,288, while the average in Dallas is $2,947, Guroo.com reports. Consumers are urged to take that average to their physicians to see if they can match or beat it.\n\nMany times, however, physicians have no idea what their services cost. That depends on the deal negotiated by the consumer\u2019s health insurance company, which, in turn, is based on discounts off the inflated retail price. The discounts are typically confidential, so competitors won\u2019t be able to see them.\n\nMost insurers now offer consumers some type of price estimates and can steer them to lower-cost providers.\n\nQuality, however, is even more difficult to determine than price.\n\nAn array of consulting firms has stepped in to help employers and their workers find answers for both price and quality. They use the company claims data to build a record for physicians and hospitals showing which ones have the most success, and lowest costs.\n\nHealth care summits\n\nDavid Toomey of Compass Professional Health Services is one of those consultants. He\u2019s also precipitated much of the change in the Dallas health care field.\n\nOver the last six years, Toomey has masterminded two Dallas health care summits. With Bishop, Toomey went to the benefit managers of the largest employers in Dallas with the same Medicare-plus bargaining proposal that\u2019s now been adopted by the municipalities. (The Dallas companies declined.)\n\nThis fall, Toomey invited Torinus to Dallas to speak with some of those same employers about the need to rebel against the high cost of care.\n\n\u201cThis is ultimately one of top three expense lines of your company,\u201d Toomey said in echoing Torinus\u2019 remarks. \u201cIt\u2019s really going to take the employers to drive the change. He [Torinus] took hold of it. He told his workers, \u2018I need you to be responsible for your health. I need you to see a doctor and get primary care.\u2019\n\n\u201cAll this stuff we\u2019ve been talking about for years can get your emergency room visits cut in half, get your employees to get a physical, get their cancer screenings \u2014 it cuts that health care inflation way down.\u201d\n\nEnergy Future Holdings, one of Toomey\u2019s Dallas clients, has managed to cut health care cost growth to 1.5 percent a year. It\u2019s a telling comparison to the municipalities still struggling with growth near 10 percent a year.\n\n\u201cIt still needs to go down, but they\u2019ve [Energy Future Holdings] made major strides,\u201d Toomey said.\n\nThe common ground in these reform drives is getting consumers to take responsibility for their health \u2014 by buying insurance, by paying more out of their own pockets when they need care, by seeing a doctor and getting the screenings and preventive care that can avoid a medical catastrophe.\n\nIf employers can get their workers started down that road, Toomey, Torinus and Bishop say their next hurdle is to manage health care costs the way they manage the rest of their business: confront their suppliers, and shop for better prices.\n\nFort Worth\u2019s Dickerson is all in. \u201cWe\u2019re going to start with hospitals,\u201d he said. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t mean we aren\u2019t going to go to imaging and other services like radiology. I know at least one outpatient surgery clinic that\u2019s going to submit bids for our business.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Dallas, Fort Worth and 29 other cities in North Texas are rebelling against high hospital costs.
