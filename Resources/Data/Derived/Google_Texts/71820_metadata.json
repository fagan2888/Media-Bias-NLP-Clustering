Sometimes I would copy my grandmother as she prayed toward Mecca. I remember the ritual: bow down, come back up, bow down, looking to both sides while twirling my right fingers. Then she would pick me up with a sheet tied around her waist and carry me over to the neighborhood park, where we would lie down in the grass. This is all a dream to me now. A time when an elderly woman with a hijab and her granddaughter wouldn\u2019t get stared at for being a Muslim.\n\nBack then, I felt like an ordinary child. Ours wasn\u2019t a religious family, besides celebrating Eid-al-Fitr and Ramadan. \u201cMuslim\u201d wasn\u2019t my identity. It was my faith. I was an American.\n\nBut my identity crumbled when the Twin Towers fell. I was 8 years old, in third grade, and I was as frantic as any kid would be that day, trying to understand why so many children had to lose their mothers and fathers. I couldn\u2019t imagine their pain.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re a terrorist!\u201d said my best friend in the hallways of our elementary school, pointing at me, his innocent eyes turned menacing. I couldn\u2019t believe it. But this was the start of a new life for me.\n\nThat year was hell. Friends distanced themselves. Teachers became mean. Such alienation was normal for me and surely millions of Muslims worldwide in those years. Fearing discrimination and violent attacks, my family changed our last name. \u201cHarvard\u201d was a slice of Americana; a far cry from our original surname. My parents wanted to protect my sister and me, but elementary school teachers and kids knew exactly what had happened, and our situation only became worse. In my silence, lies continued to grow.\n\nIn sixth grade, a teaching assistant gathered all the students around the classroom for the last lesson of the day.\n\n\u201cIslam is an evil religion. Muslims all around the world kill innocent, non-Muslim people,\u201d she said. \u201cIn their holy book, they said that all good Muslim children must kill kids like you.\u201d\n\nI wanted to say something. I wanted to speak out, because I knew that wasn\u2019t true. I wanted to tell her that I would never hurt my best friends or any living thing, and that there are more than a billion Muslims who are loving and kind.\n\nBut I had no power. I was a child, a Muslim one, and she was an adult with authority. What voice did I have?\n\nThat year I moved to a new school about an hour away. It was the perfect opportunity to start over and pretend to be somebody I was not. I completely disregarded my faith publicly as a Muslim \u2014 and my real life undercover began.\n\nLiving as a fraud is exhausting. It\u2019s exhausting to your mind, body and soul. It seemed like people asked me most about my faith when I kept it a secret. My father taught me how to reply:\n\n\u201cWhat do you say when someone asks what is your religion?\u201d asked my dad.\n\n\u201cThat there is no god but God,\u201d I replied.\n\n\u201cNooooo,\u201d with his elongated gasp of disapproval, \u201cyou say that you are seeking the truth.\u201d\n\nStrangely enough, inside our house, the opposite was happening. With persecutions of Muslim-Americans at an all-time high, my father pushed our family to learn more about our faith. My parents never missed a single day of prayer. I would wake up in the middle of the night and go downstairs for a glass of water only to hear the booming voice of the Qu\u2019ran over our Bose stereo. My parents started playing it on a loop to protect us from any hardship or \u201cevil,\u201d and they still do it to this day.\n\nBut hiding like this comes at a great cost. I didn\u2019t have close friends, because I feared discovery and didn\u2019t think anyone could ever understand. Elementary school had taught me the cost of exposure. I could not trust anyone with my deepest, darkest secret.\n\nI was a freshman in college when I first came close to being discovered. My friends and I were about to order late-night pizza.\n\n\u201cHey Sarah, you want a slice of pepperoni?\u201d said my friend.\n\n\u201cNah, I\u2019m good. Thanks, though,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cWait, you don\u2019t eat pork?\u201d he asked.\n\nI tried to cover my tracks. \u201cNah, I just don\u2019t like it.\u201d\n\n\u201cWait, are you a Muslim?\u201d\n\nI panicked. I didn\u2019t know what to do. Should I finally embrace it? Would I lose my friends over this? Why can\u2019t I just let it go? All those thoughts were rushing through my head. Luckily, the conversation was hijacked by some loud drunk running through the hallways. Crisis averted.\n\nFast-forward to the summer of 2013 when I had a journalism internship in Washington D.C. I was excited to be working in the same city as the White House, amid the action of the nation\u2019s capital. And it was going great, until I realized the journalism industry wasn\u2019t exempt from outdated bigotry. We were discussing a potential story about the rise of Mormonism one day, and I was alarmed to hear the typical uneducated jokes from staffers about polygamy and bountiful offspring. I was trying to set the record straight, when someone mentioned Islam.", "article_metadata": {"description": "For 12 years, I hid my true identity from friends.
