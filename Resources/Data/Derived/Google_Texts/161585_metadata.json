Ted Cruz, R-Texas, speaks during a campaign stop on Sept. 3, 2015, in Tyler, Texas. (Photo: Sarah A. Miller, AP)\n\nHOUSTON \u2014 Long before he became a leading presidential candidate, Rafael Edward Cruz was a bright, ambitious teenager who memorized chunks of the U.S. Constitution and had a love for free market principles, as well as a penchant for occasional trouble.\n\nToday, Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz \u2014 as he\u2019s more widely known \u2014 ranks near the top of the polls in the crowded GOP presidential field and has amassed an impressive war chest for the 2016 race.\n\nIn Washington, though, he\u2019s rankled leaders of his own party by calling out Republican colleagues on issues and taking seemingly contrarian positions on a litany of subjects. His 21-hour filibuster in 2013 over the Affordable Care Act led to a temporary government shutdown and cemented his anti-establishment role.\n\nCruz\u2019s mercurial trajectory from bookish drama student to Senate rebel surprised few of those who knew him as a high school teen and into his college years at Princeton University and Harvard Law School.\n\n\u201cTed was never a company man,\u2019\u2019 said Robert George, Cruz\u2019s Princeton professor who supervised his thesis work. \u201cHe thinks for himself. He always did. He asks questions and, if he\u2019s not satisfied with the party line, he\u2019s going to break free.\u201d\n\nCruz\u2019s questioning of authority and dogged stands on issues may have become evident in Princeton \u2014 where he was a debate champion \u2014 but they were forged while growing up in the well-to-do western stretches of Houston.\n\nHe was a self-described \u201cgeeky kid\u201d in elementary and junior high, the child of two mathematicians and naturally good at school. But by junior high, Cruz decided to shake off his bookworm persona. He changed his name to \u201cTed\u201d and got more involved in sports.\n\n\u201cMidway through junior high school, I decided that I\u2019d had enough of being the unpopular nerd,\u201d Cruz writes in his memoir, A Time For Truth.\n\nBy the time he reached high school at Second Baptist School in Houston, Cruz was performing in plays, making the honor roll, playing varsity soccer and basketball and leading the speech team. His senior year yearbook mentions or quotes Cruz 11 times.\n\n\u201cSome kids just stand out over the years,\u201d said Gary Moore, a senior pastor at the school. . \u201cHe was one of them.\u201d\n\nBut Cruz was also dabbling in trouble. In his book, he describes sneaking out of a friend\u2019s house one night during sophomore year and being beaten up by older kids, and, in another incident, getting caught after decorating a rival school with toilet paper and shaving cream.\n\nHis senior yearbook alludes to an incident where one of Cruz\u2019s eyebrows may have been shaven off during a trip to Mardi Gras in New Orleans with friends. \u201cIt seems a mad eyebrow shaver had escaped, and poor Ted was his untimely victim,\u201d the entry reads. \u201cHope it grows back soon!\u201d\n\nGOP candidate Ted Cruz, shown here in his senior year yearbook photo, attended Second Baptist High School in Houston, where he performed in plays and played varsity sports. (Photo: Second Baptist School)\n\nWhile in high school, Cruz joined the Free Enterprise Education Center (today known as the Free Enterprise Institute), a non-profit conservative educational institute which became a formative endeavor for Cruz. Cruz competed in speech competitions at the center, winning most of them, and gave speeches on U.S. Constitutional principles to Rotary and Kiwanis clubs across Texas, said Winston Elliott, the institute\u2019s president and an advisor to the group during Cruz\u2019s time there.\n\nAs part of the exercises, Cruz, along with other students, used acronym memorization techniques to memorize sections of the Constitution. Unlike other students, who participated mainly to win class credit or scholarship money, Cruz relished and believed in the speeches he gave, Elliott said.\n\n\u201cWhen Ted talks about being upset about this is unconstitutional or that\u2019s unconstitutional or spending needs to be cut, he\u2019s only been saying that for 30 years,\u201d Elliott said. \u201cAt some point, you have to think he\u2019s probably not just saying this for political reasons. This is actually what he believes.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cCan he fire up the rhetoric, too? Yes. That\u2019s part of politics.\u201d\n\nAt a rally last week organized by a Houston-area Tea Party group, Cruz did just that. In a 40-minute speech to an auditorium packed with fervent supporters, Cruz promised to repeal Obamacare and undo the Iran nuclear deal if elected president, promised to abolish the Internal Revenue Service and dispatch its agents to defend the U.S. border with Mexico, and urged the release of Kim Davis, the Kentucky clerk jailed for refusing to issue marriage licenses to gay couples, who was released on Tuesday.\n\nCruz earned 13 standing ovations and repeated chants of \u201cCRUUUUUUZ!\u201d throughout the speech.\n\n\u201cHe knows what liberty and freedom are all about,\u201d said Char Close, 60, who drove 60 miles to see the candidate. \u201cHe\u2019s also Texan. Texans do things a little differently.\u201d\n\nFollow @MrRJervis on Twitter\n\nRead or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1UJHLs9", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Cruz\u2019s mercurial trajectory from bookish drama student to Senate rebel surprised few of those who knew him as a teen.", "og": {"site_name": "USA TODAY", "description": "Cruz\u2019s mercurial trajectory from bookish drama student to Senate rebel surprised few of those who knew him as a teen.", "title": "Ted Cruz's Houston past molded today's 2016 contender", "url": "http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/09/10/ted-cruz-houston-past-senator-elections/71939570/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/usatoday.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Cruz\u2019s mercurial trajectory from bookish drama student to Senate rebel surprised few of those who knew him as a teen.", "title": "Ted Cruz's Houston past molded today's 2016 contender", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/3582feea786e0e581d885dabcc9db8dd0e1529c4/c=316-0-1685-1369&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/09/09/USATODAY/USATODAY/635774020925494306-Cruz2.jpg", "creator": "@usatoday", "site": "@usatoday", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "fb": {"app_id": 215046668549694}, "viewport": "width=1070", "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Events/Mardi Gras", "gci-asset-type": "story", "gci-categories": "Events/Mardi Gras", "title": "Ted Cruz's Houston past molded today's 2016 contender", "author": "Rick Jervis", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "news/politics/elections", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/a692c6e7e2990da1e3aacf9dc3fb8954b4fc58e2/c=487-0-1514-1369/local/-/media/2015/09/09/USATODAY/USATODAY/635774020925494306-Cruz2.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/278da1bc680b8a114022d5b521ea05f8551c97ce/c=316-0-1685-1369/local/-/media/2015/09/09/USATODAY/USATODAY/635774020925494306-Cruz2.jpg", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/fc2b9fe32420d0608578dff7e360c46bfebf9eb1/c=90-0-1911-1369/local/-/media/2015/09/09/USATODAY/USATODAY/635774020925494306-Cruz2.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/7b4f4839d0afb1c594e33c165453ed99fd7b21e3/c=0-120-2000-1250&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/2015/09/09/USATODAY/USATODAY/635774020925494306-Cruz2.jpg", "publishtime": "2015-09-10T14:43:28.433000-04:00", "shorthed": "Ted Cruz's Houston past molded today's 2016 contender", "articleid": 71939570, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/7d2b3d7fccdef7c94e16f139f07c844fe085e9b7/c=0-120-2000-1250/local/-/media/2015/09/09/USATODAY/USATODAY/635774020925494306-Cruz2.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/8a8951e87f0942c75883aae4de1519ebb2fc6ab4/c=617-0-1384-1369/local/-/media/2015/09/09/USATODAY/USATODAY/635774020925494306-Cruz2.jpg"}}, "news_keywords": "Ted Cruz, Houston, Texas, Republicans, 2016 presidential race"}, "article_summary": "Sen.
