The Speaker of the House’s primary challenger wants voters to consider an important question: Does John Boehner (R-Ohio) have electile dysfunction?

J.D. Winteregg, a high school teacher looking to take down one of the most powerful Republicans in Congress, released a campaign ad on Sunday that was styled exactly like a commercial for Viagra, a drug that helps men with erectile dysfunction.

“You make a great team,” the ad’s narrator says. “It’s been that way since the day you met. But your electile dysfunction? It could be a question of blood flow. Sometimes, when a politician has been in D.C. too long, it goes to his head and he just can’t seem to get the job done.”

The narrator goes on to promise that Winteregg will keep the border secure, protect Americans’ Second Amendment rights and defund Obamacare and Planned Parenthood.

But how will a voter know if Boehner really does have electile dysfunction? Side effects include skin discoloration and golf. And, of course, if your Boehner lasts too long, be sure to seek immediate medical attention.
