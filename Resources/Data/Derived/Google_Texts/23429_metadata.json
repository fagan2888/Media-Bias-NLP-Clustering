IRS said in response that it agreed with TIGTA's recommendations and had already put fixes in place.\n\n\"The IRS ensured that ACA funds were accurately tracked,\" adding that it spent appropriately the money it used from the special fund, the agency said in a statement.\n\nEnacted in March 2010, the healthcare law made many tax code changes, including requiring the IRS to verify that most people have health insurance in 2014. It must also disperse new tax credits meant to help people meet their insurance costs.\n\nThe IRS expects to spend $360 million on Obamacare implementation in fiscal 2013, which ends September 30, TIGTA said.\n\nUnless Congress gives the IRS more money for the healthcare law, the agency will have to dip into its operating budget, already cut by Congress, TIGTA said.\n\nRepublicans in the House of Representatives have proposed cutting the IRS budget by 24 percent in fiscal 2014 and have voted repeatedly to defund Obamacare.\n\nThe Obama administration's fiscal 2014 budget requested $440 million for the IRS to administer the law's tax provisions.\n\n(Reporting by Patrick Temple-West; Editing by Kevin Drawbaugh and Eric Beech)", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Reuters Editorial", "Author": "Reuters Editorial", "DCSext.PageNumber": 1, "twitter": {"description": "The U.S. Internal Revenue Service needs to do a better job tracking its spending related to President Barack Obama's new healthcare law, an IRS watchdog said on Wednesday.", "title": "IRS struggles to track its 'Obamacare' spending: watchdog", "image": "http://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20130926&t=2&i=797432119&w=&fh=545px&fw=&ll=&pl=&sq=&r=CBRE98P07GZ00", "creator": "@Reuters", "site": "@Reuters", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "DCSext.rChannel": "Article -
