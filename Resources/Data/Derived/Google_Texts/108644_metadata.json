He has, however, repeatedly denounced fellow liberals for looking the other way when it comes to radical Islam. Maher has also chided liberals for remaining silent about civil liberties/privacy violations under the Obama administration.\n\nOn Real Time last night, Maher declared that Trump\u2019s lead in Iowa, a caucus state supposedly dominated by conservative Christians, was a giant story, given the businessman\u2019s New York and secular roots. He also quipped that no other candidate can compete with Trump giving kids rides in his helicopter at the Iowa State Fair, which happened during Trump\u2019s visit to the event today.\n\nIn the panel discussion, Maher identified with Trump\u2019s politically incorrect approach to politics which explains the candidate\u2019s, so far, broad appeal even potentially to those caucus voters who might otherwise be expected to gravitate toward a more traditionally conservative candidate.\n\n\u201cEven the evangelicals want to be called on their sh*t. They are desperate to have somebody lead them, somebody say, \u2018you know what, I just don\u2019t bend to your bullsh*t.\u2019 And Donald Trump, I gotta say, I don\u2019t agree with him on a lot\u2026but I kinda get him. We kinda been doing the same thing.\u201d\n\nThe two Democrats on the panel accused Donald Trump of racism, while the conventional Republicans bemoaned the fact that none of the other candidates can get any media coverage because of the Trump juggernaut. Former Michigan Gov. Jennifer Granholm even compared Trump to a villain on a reality show like Survivor.\n\nIn a recent interview with a North Carolina news outlet, Bill Maher similarly admitted a solid appreciation for what he called the politically incorrect genius of Donald Trump.\n\n\u201cEven though I don\u2019t agree with everything Donald Trump says by far, it is sort of refreshing to have a politician who isn\u2019t always walking everything back and who isn\u2019t completely pre-programmed. That\u2019s his genius, he doesn\u2019t apologize for anything\u2026\u201d\n\nIn his monologue that preceded the panel discussion Friday evening, Bill Maher compared Donald Trump to an iconic movie monster.\n\n\u201cEvery week Donald Trump says something crazy, insane, outlandish, and everyone goes \u2018that\u2019s it, that\u2019s his downfall,\u2019 and then he\u2019s fine\u2026He\u2019s like Godzilla; everything they throw at the monster makes him stronger.\u201d\n\nTrump mobbed walking into the Fair. \"My crowd is 10 times Hillary's,\" he brags. pic.twitter.com/4b3TgXH74C \u2014 Eli Stokols (@EliStokols) August 15, 2015\n\nHe also alluded to the notion that the line of questioning from Fox News Channel anchor Megyn Kelly and the other two GOP debate moderators was an attempt to destroy Donald Trump. With regard to Trump\u2019s master plan to defeat ISIS, Bill Maher joked that \u201cI would laugh, except his plan to defeat Fox News worked.\u201d\n\n[Photo by Kevin Winter/Getty Images Entertainment]", "article_metadata": {"description": "Bill Maher apparently thinks he and \"Godzilla-like\" Donald Trump are on the same page to some degree despite their ideological differences.
