Her prospects are bleak.\n\nMeanwhile, Carroll is likely to be re-elected as a councillor.\n\nVaughan seems pleased to have replaced Chow, winning the federal Trinity-Spadina seat she vacated and defeating Joe Cressy in the process, a long-time ally and friend of Chow and her late husband, Jack Layton.\n\nChow has tried to bill herself as fiscally responsible, to distance herself from the tax-and-spend reputation of her party.\n\nIt is a hard sell for a left-wing politician to make, and she did little to add to her credibility when she proposed scrapping the Scarborough subway expansion to save money, but keeping the revenue from the dedicated property tax for it to spend on other transit priorities.\n\nThe main reason Chow is no longer leading in the polls isn\u2019t because she\u2019s not likable (she is), nor is it related to any specific policy.\n\nShe has simply been unable to offer a compelling reason to vote for her.\n\nNeeding a mayor other than Rob Ford becomes an empty campaign battle cry, when the incumbent quits the mayoral race due to a diagnosis of cancer.\n\nTorontonians are uninterested in squared curbs, and no one wants to see property taxes increase more than the rate of inflation, which fairly or not, many believe she will do. (She says she won\u2019t.)\n\nPerhaps most harmful to her campaign has been her transportation platform.\n\nChow argues hers makes more sense than John Tory\u2019s or Doug Ford\u2019s, but she\u2019s been unable to explain it clearly.\n\nMany people don\u2019t want more buses or LRTs, which they see as a fancy name for streetcars.\n\nThey want subways \u2013 and Chow abandoned Scarborough subway expansion early on in her campaign.\n\nIt surprises many that Rob Ford is a highly effective political communicator when he\u2019s on his game.\n\nHis message may not sound pretty, but people know what it is.\n\nIn the last election in 2010, there wasn\u2019t a voter who didn\u2019t know who Rob Ford was, why he was running for mayor and what he said he would do -- stop the gravy train at City Hall and show respect for taxpayers.\n\nChow has been unable to find that clarity.\n\nHer message has been muddled and confusing.\n\nVoters know she wants to be a \u201cnew mayor\u201d but they aren\u2019t really sure why.\n\nThis is hardly a unique problem for a would-be municipal politician.\n\nOntarians rejected former PC leader Tim Hudak and Canadians said no thank you to former Liberal leader Michael Ignatieff for very similar reasons.\n\nOf the three major mayoral candidates now in the race, Chow is the first to release a full platform document.\n\nPerhaps it was in an effort to regain momentum, more likely an effort to stay relevant.\n\nIt\u2019s a 46-page, text-heavy document \u2013 that achieved its diversity quota so well, a keen observer could mistake it for a Ford Fest brochure.\n\nBut it will not help Chow regain the lead she allowed to slip away in this race.\n\nIt may be useful for journalists and policy wonks \u2013 but Chow needs to provoke interest from the voters who have left her since she launched her campaign.\n\nSome of Chow\u2019s criticisms of John Tory\u2019s \u201cSmartTrack\u201d transit plan are valid but the overall idea of it is clear and it\u2019s something voters hear and understand.\n\nIt\u2019s simple, it\u2019s visual -- using electric trains on existing GO lines to kickstart Toronto\u2019s public transit system into the 21st century.\n\nIf all you\u2019re doing is grasping at flaws in SmartTrack, as Chow is, you\u2019re losing the debate.\n\nChow\u2019s platform lacks that appeal.\n\nIt is so text heavy that Chow\u2019s supporters won\u2019t be inspired by it and her opponents won\u2019t be worried about it.\n\nWith the sand draining out of the hour glass, Chow has little time left to reverse the trend of early Toronto megacity mayoral frontrunners (Barbara Hall, George Smitherman) fading in the stretch.\n\nIndeed, at this point, it appears as if the more Chow campaigns, the more her numbers drop.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Toronto Sun", "description": "Last year, Toronto\u2019s left-wing establishment \r\nthought they knew what they were doing when \r\nthey pushed potential mayoral candidates \r\nShelley Carroll and Adam Vaughan aside.", "title": "What happened to Olivia Chow?", "url": "http://www.torontosun.com/2014/10/04/what-happened-to-olivia-chow?utm_source=facebook&utm_medium=recommend-button&utm_campaign= What happened to Olivia Chow?", "image": "http://storage.torontosun.com/v1/suns-prod-images/1297537114645_LARGE_BOX.jpg?quality=80&stmp=1464253933625", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 162622253780945}, "description": "Last year, Toronto\u2019s left-wing establishment \r\nthought they knew what they were doing when \r\nthey pushed potential mayoral candidates \r\nShelley Carroll and Adam Vaughan aside.", "robots": "NOODP,NOYDIR"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce4bc\"", "article_summary": "Olivia Chow, the popular downtown NDP MP and former Toronto councillor would be their choice to beat Toronto Mayor Rob Ford.\nWith just three weeks to go in this ridiculously long mayoral campaign, the former frontrunner, Chow, is now third in every published poll.\nIt surprises many that Rob Ford is a highly effective political communicator when he\u2019s on his game.\nOf the three major mayoral candidates now in the race, Chow is the first to release a full platform document.\nChow argues hers makes more sense than John Tory\u2019s or Doug Ford\u2019s, but she\u2019s been unable to explain it clearly."}
