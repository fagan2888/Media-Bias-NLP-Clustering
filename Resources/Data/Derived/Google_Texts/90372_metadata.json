New York is the only state to my knowledge that bans age rating for individual health insurance premiums and uses a \u201ccommunity rating\u201d for premiums*. Consequently, we used a single age profile for this market since it would not affect the results. The census profile for the quotes that underly the averages was an individual with a birthday on 1984-01-01. If the deductible was listed as \"No Maximum\", then we used the MOOP value as the deductible. If the deductible was listed as \"Not Applicable\", then I used $0 for the deductible.\n\n*Healthcare.gov describes \"community rating\" as: a rule that prevents health insurers from varying premiums within a geographic area based on age, gender, health status or other factors.\ufeff\n\nOther analysis by Kaiser Health News shows that care costs can vary widely within counties, something which the \"community rating\" of New York's system mitigates against.\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office which provides non-partisan analysis for the U.S. Congress says that factors affecting health insurance premiums include the costs of administering health plans and,\n\nAn insurer\u2019s costs for covered services in turn reflect the scope of benefits that are included, the plan\u2019s cost-sharing requirements, and the health status of the plan\u2019s enrollees.\ufeff\n\nThe healthcare.gov website has more on the factors that influence premiums.\n\nResearch by the Leonard Davis School of Health Economics also points to \"lack of economies of scale and lack of competition among providers\", as influencing differences particularly in more rural areas.\ufeff\n\nBelow are the zip codes used to quote for each county zone.
