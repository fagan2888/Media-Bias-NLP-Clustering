FLAGSTAFF, Ariz. — Firefighters say they are slowly making progress in controlling a wildfire burning in a northern Arizona canyon.

The fire’s size was 21 square miles as of Sunday morning but is 10 percent contained.

The Slide Fire has grown in the last two days due to crews setting fires to rob the blaze of its natural forest fuels.

Fire spokesman Rico Smith says firefighters are focused on strengthening containment lines and clearing debris on the western end.

He says aerial drops of water and fire ignition devices in areas they want to intentionally burn are resuming.

Some burnout operations were delayed Saturday night because of rain.

The fire is burning around Oak Creek Canyon, a scenic recreation area along the highway between Sedona and Flagstaff.

No homes have been destroyed.
