Politico itself reported that Trump has since \u201cdisavowed\u201d those positions, and Breitbart News reported that Trump is a concealed permit holder, a lifetime member of the NRA, and is against an \u201cassault weapons\u201d ban, a \u201chigh capacity\u201d magazine ban, an expansion of background checks, and the continuance of gun-free zones in public places and on military bases.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nYet, Politico suggests there is backlash over the NRA\u2019s endorsement of Trump.\n\nAt the same time, Politico acknowledges that NRA-ILA executive director Chris Cox stood in front of thousands upon thousands of NRA members during Friday\u2019s Leadership Forum and said those who are bitter because their candidate didn\u2019t win need to \u201cget over it.\u201d\n\nCox\u2019s exact words: \u201cIf your preferred candidate dropped out of the race, it\u2019s time to get over it.\u201d\n\nPolitico then cited NRA member David Davis, who used a Facebook post to disavow the NRA following the Trump endorsement, and who called Trump a \u201clying, progressive, anti-gun democrat.\u201d Davis said he refuses to \u201cget over it,\u201d choosing instead to cut ties with the NRA.\n\nCounting Davis, that makes a total of two disgruntled NRA members out of more than five million. Are two out of more than five million really grounds to suggest a \u201cbacklash?\u201d\n\nBreitbart News spoke with NRA Board Member Buz Mills about Trump at the NRA gathering in Lousiville, Kentucky, on Saturday. Mills said:\n\nEver since Trump came out I\u2019ve been on the Trump train. And the reason is because he is a business guy. And you know, people say, \u201cWell, he\u2019s not a Republican\u201d or \u201cHe\u2019s not a Democrat.\u201d And that\u2019s right. He\u2019s a pragmatist. He sees a problem and he solves it. And he doesn\u2019t care for flavoring it to your favorite religions or political parties or whatever, because that requires pandering. Instead, Trump sees a problem and he acts to fix it. And this makes him unique among candidates in my lifetime.\n\nMills then spoke specifically to Trump\u2019s position on guns versus Hillary Clinton\u2019s position on guns, saying, \u201cHillary is going to lie to you and take your guns out of your pocket while she\u2019s patting you on the shoulder and Donald is going to say, \u2018I don\u2019t want your guns.'\u201d\n\nAWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and political analyst for Armed American Radio.
