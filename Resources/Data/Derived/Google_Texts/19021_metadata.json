(Photo: NONE , HEALTHCARE.ORG )\n\nTuesday is the deadline for enrolling in Obamacare for those who want coverage to start Jan. 1.\n\nAnd the state Department of Insurance wants to make sure that customers of Consumers\u2019 Choice Health Plan know they must find other coverage since the plan has shut down.\n\n\u201cA lot of people just think their coverage will be rolled over. That will not be the case for Consumers\u2019 Choice,\u201d Insurance Commissioner Ray Farmer told The Greenville News. \u201cSo we want to make sure that those people ... will sign up for other coverage.\u201d\n\nAlso known as the Affordable Care Act, the law requires most Americans to have health insurance or pay a penalty.\n\nUnder the law, people can purchase health insurance through the marketplace if their household income is between 100 percent and 400 percent of the federal poverty level. And most who do are eligible for a subsidy to help pay for that coverage, often reducing premiums to less than $100 a month.\n\nSome people are exempt from the individual mandate to have coverage, including those making less than 100 percent of the poverty level.\n\nBut those who are required to get coverage and don't will face penalties of $695 per adult, and half that per child, or 2.5 percent of household income this year, whichever is higher.\n\nNationwide, more than 2.8 million consumers had enrolled in a plan by Dec. 5, including 78,238 in South Carolina, federal health officials said.\n\nConsumers\u2019 Choice was among 23 co-ops initially funded by the federal government, but some promised funds weren\u2019t provided which, in conjunction with several other issues, presented a financial risk and it voluntarily shut down in October.\n\nOf the company\u2019s 67,000 members, only 35 percent have signed up for another plan so far, he said. Those who fail to sign up by Dec. 15 will still be able to obtain coverage, but it will be more difficult to do, he said.\n\nAnother 1,000 customers of Time Insurance Co., which was marketed as Assurant Health, will have to look for another plan as well because the company stopped offering insurance nationwide, Farmer said.\n\nThere are still four companies and dozens of plans to choose from, he said.\n\nAs of June 1, 168,000 South Carolinians had Obamacare coverage, Farmer said. But consumers typically wait until the last minute to sign up, he said.\n\nLast year, more than half the enrollments occurred in the two weeks before the Dec. 15 deadline, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. And this year, returning consumers are expected to make up a larger portion of total enrollment than new customers.\n\nBuy Photo Stephania Priester of New Horizon Family Health Services gives a tour of the new Faris Road facility on Wednesday.
