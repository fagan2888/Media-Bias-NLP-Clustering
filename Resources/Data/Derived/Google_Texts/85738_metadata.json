For many, that type of expense is financially devastating or would, at a minimum, cause severe financial hardship. This is particularly true for those unable to work because they are recovering from an accident, receiving treatment for a life-threatening disease, or disabled by a heart attack. That's why The IHC Group developed Metal Gap \u2013 affordable coverage (in some cases as little as $1 per day) to pay for much of what the Obamacare 'metal' plans do not.\"\n\nMetal Gap complements major-medical health insurance, providing between $3,500-$6,350 in accident coverage, $7,500 in critical illness coverage, an optional $500 in first-day hospital stay benefit, plus $500 a day for hospital confinements up to 10 days. Additionally, all Metal Gap plans provide discount vision and prescription drug coverage.\n\n\"Our Metal Gap cash benefit can be used for hospital bills, daycare, mortgage and car payments or anything else. The plans are designed to fill the gap, in many circumstances, between first dollar expenses and the maximum out-of-pocket allowed by Obamacare plans, but they can be used however the individual sees fit,\" added Keller.\n\nTo learn more about Metal Gap coverage or to contract as a licensed agent with The IHC Group contact 866-746-6610.\n\n1 Metal Gap is not a comprehensive health plan and does not constitute \"minimum essential coverage\" as defined under the ACA.
