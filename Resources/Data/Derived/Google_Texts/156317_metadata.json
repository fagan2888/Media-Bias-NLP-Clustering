The goal, according to Harvard professor of Chinese History Michael Puett, is to be able to move through the day without letting the little things get to you. But Puett, who is also the co-author of The Path, said this is not how ancient philosophers intended it.\n\n\u201cChinese philosophers will, on the contrary, push strongly that no, you actually don\u2019t want to be too comfortable with the world as it is, or with interactions as they are, or with things you're doing,\" Puett said in an interview with Big Think. \u201c...They would say, no, you should actually be trianing yourself to respond in ways that could affect situations for the better.\"\n\nThe latter idea is what leads to fundamental change, something Americans miss out on when they focus solely on self-acceptance. It's also much closer to how mindfulness was original practiced before Americans adapted it and turned it into the meditative approach many of us know and love today.\n\nThat's not to say the mindfulness exercises Americans have grown a custom to are bad, but rather these exercises could be even more beneficial if also focused on methods of growth and improvement. At the end of the day, transformation is the ultimate goal of mindfulness, which requires both self-acceptance and change.\n\nThere's a seemingly endless list of mental and emotional benefits people can reap from practicing mindfulness. According to the American Psychological Association, it improves everything from stress, to memory, focus, cognition, and emotional reactivity.\n\n\u201cTrain yourself to be something better than who you were at birth,\u201d Puett said. \u201cIf we stick to what we\u2019re naturally meant to be, Chinese philosophers would say that\u2019s extremely constraining to what we can do.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "mindful, meditation, through, years, why, ancient, chinese, philosophers, were, against, self", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Mindfulness exercises can improve emotional and mental health, but only if done as ancient Chinese philosophers intended.", "title": "Everything You Know About Mindful Meditation Is Wrong", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/mindful-meditation-ancient-chinese-philosophers-self-acceptance-382276", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured_video/public/2016/04/17/ancient-mindfulness-exercises-differ-modern-practice-why-chinese-philosophers-shun.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Mindfulness exercises can improve emotional and mental health, but only if done as ancient Chinese philosophers intended.", "title": "Everything You Know About Mindful Meditation Is Wrong", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/mindful-meditation-ancient-chinese-philosophers-self-acceptance-382276", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured_video/public/2016/04/17/ancient-mindfulness-exercises-differ-modern-practice-why-chinese-philosophers-shun.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2016/04/17/ancient-mindfulness-exercises-differ-modern-practice-why-chinese-philosophers-shun.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Under the Hood", "published_time": "2016-04-17T16:30:27-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-17T16:30:26-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Mindfulness exercises can improve emotional and mental health, but only if done as ancient Chinese philosophers intended."}, "article_summary": "\u201cIf we stick to what we\u2019re naturally meant to be, Chinese philosophers would say that\u2019s extremely constraining to what we can do.\u201d\nBut Puett, who is also the co-author of The Path, said this is not how ancient philosophers intended it.\nAt the end of the day, transformation is the ultimate goal of mindfulness, which requires both self-acceptance and change.\nThe latter idea is what leads to fundamental change, something Americans miss out on when they focus solely on self-acceptance.\nThe goal, according to Harvard professor of Chinese History Michael Puett, is to be able to move through the day without letting the little things get to you."}
