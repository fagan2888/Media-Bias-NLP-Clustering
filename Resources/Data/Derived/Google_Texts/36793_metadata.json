No,\u201d a police source told DNAinfo New York, adding that officers routinely ask parents whether they have children after an arrest, and give parents time to use the phone to make last-minute arrangements for their care. \"Unless we have a feeling that he's keeping something from us or we know something more about his background, there's nothing we have to do.\u201d\n\nUnless the child is in the home at the time of the arrest, the source said, police do not intervene if a caregiver appears to have made sufficient arrangements.\n\nACS wasn\u2019t required to check on Myls either, even though the agency had removed him from his mother\u2019s care three years earlier.\n\nIn 2011, ACS workers had accused Myls\u2019 mother, Ashley Dobson, of neglect and recommended a family court judge give custody of him to Wade, a convicted felon. Under the custody conditions, ACS monitored Wade and Myls for a year, but the supervision ended September 2012.\n\nDobson said at press conference Friday with her mother, Faye Bennett, that she saw the child on a weekly basis, but had no way of knowing that Wade had left the child with King. She said that she last saw Myls at the end of November. Bennett claimed she reached out to ACS when the boy could not be found, but child welfare authorities deny that.\n\nA city official who spoke on the condition anonymity said that from Dec. 18 until the day Myls died, no one \u2014 including the boy's relatives \u2014 inquired with ACS about his location or expressed concerns about his safety. Without any alerts, ACS had no cause to act.\n\nThe agency acknowledged the limits of the law in a statement Friday afternoon.\n\n\"Unfortunately, once ACS' involvement with a family has concluded, the agency no longer has oversight authority,\" ACS spokesman Michael Fagan said. \"As instructed by the mayor, we are launching a thorough review of the case to learn what happened and might have been done differently to serve the child welfare needs of the little boy.\"\n\nThe gap in the system proved fatal for Myls.\n\nWhile in King's care, Myls was burned with lit cigarettes and a heated oven grate, whipped with belts, and starved for weeks inside King's $3,200-a-month apartment at The Ritz Plaza, police sources said.\n\nThe abuse culminated Tuesday night when King admitted to locking the boy outside on her balcony to freeze in 9-degree weather for over an hour, wearing only underwear and a T-shirt, according to police sources.\n\nThe following morning investigators found the boy unconscious in a bathtub. The emaciated toddler had lost nearly 25 pounds and was covered with burns and lacerations on his body, prosecutors said.\n\nKing was arraigned Friday in Manhattan Supreme Court on charges of assault and reckless endangerment. Prosecutors vowed to charge her with murder pending the results of an autopsy.\n\nPublic Advocate Letitia James said she'd fight for reforms that would prevent such mistakes moving forward.\n\n\"There is nothing more horrific than the death of a child... we must act with the highest sense of urgency to address the gaps in our system that allowed this to happen,\" said James.\n\nMyls' death ended a short, tragic life, relatives said. Aside from an abusive mom, his father had been in and out of prison, including a three-and-half-year stint for attempted armed robbery, according to court records and family members.\n\nThe boy's paternal grandmother, Gloria Wade, was still struggling to grasp how the smiling toddler's life ended so brutally.\n\n\"I'm not going to sugarcoat my son. I feel my son and Ashley failed him. If they did the right thing, Myls wouldn't be where he is. It's sad,\" she said.\n\nAdditional reporting by Janon Fisher, Aidan Gardiner, Gustavo Solis and Katie Honan.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "description": "Law enforcement officials are not obliged to alert child protective services when they arrest a parent.", "application-name": "DNAinfo", "og": {"url": "https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20140111/midtown/loophole-child-safety-law-placed-4-year-old-hands-of-suspected-killer", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "https://assets.dnainfo.com/generated/photo/2014/01/myles-dobson-13892897617717.jpg/extralarge.jpg", "height": 400}, "site_name": "DNAinfo New York", "description": "Law enforcement officials are not obliged to alert child protective services when they arrest a parent.", "title": "Loophole in Child Safety Law Placed 4-Year-Old in Hands of Suspected Killer"}, "referrer": "always", "twitter": {"site": "@DNAinfo", "card": "summary"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "DNAinfo", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "//fluffyclouds.dnainfo.com/img/common/mstile-70x70px.png", "robots": "noarchive,noodp,noydir", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "//fluffyclouds.dnainfo.com/img/common/mstile-310x310.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "//fluffyclouds.dnainfo.com/img/common/mstile-310x150.png", "fb": {"admins": "54902139,1379988119,575522805,108424,5519941,48600120,112261,662865465", "app_id": 153948644632011}, "viewport": "width=device-width", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "keywords": "Midtown,Midtown South,Courts,Crime & Mayhem,Ashley Dobson,Bill de Blasio,Janaei Jones,Kryzie King,Myls Dobson,Okee Wade,Manhattan Criminal Court,South Carolina,ACS,Administration for Children's Services,Child Abuse,NYPD,Police,police,Ritz Plaza", "google-site-verification": "AYA-4dHbK-igtSqpqIYyKuCbHO3o3KourjkrAnfCeZc", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "//fluffyclouds.dnainfo.com/img/common/mstile-150x150.png", "googletag": {"topic": "courts,crime-mayhem", "tags": "administration-for-childrens-services,acs,nypd,police,ritz-plaza", "places": "manhattan-criminal-court,south-carolina", "people": "bill-de-blasio,okee-wade,kryzie-king,ashley-dobson,myls-dobson,janaei-jones"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdaae2\"", "article_summary": "Bennett claimed she reached out to ACS when the boy could not be found, but child welfare authorities deny that.\nWhen officers asked Wade, a convicted felon, if he had any children, he told them that a friend was caring for Myls, sources said.\nLittle Myls Dobson \u2014 the 4-year-old who was allegedly starved and tortured by his dad\u2019s transgender girlfriend in a Midtown apartment \u2014 fell through the cracks because of a loophole in the child protection law.\nUnder the custody conditions, ACS monitored Wade and Myls for a year, but the supervision ended September 2012.\nCurrently, there is nothing on the books that requires NYPD officers to notify child welfare workers when they arrest a suspect who is the primary caregiver of a kid, according to those familiar with the case."}
