Qualcomm is seeking to become less dependent on the phone market, where it\u2019s losing market share, and pushing to get its chips into areas such as drones, cars and home electronics.\n\nEmily Kilpatrick, a spokeswoman for Qualcomm, declined to comment\n\nAmazon\u2019s Fire TV Stick, a stripped-down version of the company\u2019s larger streaming box, works on a chip made by Broadcom Corp. New versions of the devices were unveiled yesterday by the Seattle-based company.\n\nAmazon\u2019s offerings, which compete against Apple TV and Roku Inc.\u2019s streaming boxes, took 30 percent of the market in the U.S. in the first quarter, according to Strategy Analytics. The devices were in use in about 36 million U.S. homes, or about a third of those with broadband Internet connections, the researcher said.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Ian King", "twitter": {"url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-09-17/amazon-chooses-mediatek-chip-for-fire-tv-over-qualcomm", "title": "Amazon Chooses MediaTek Chip for Fire TV Over Qualcomm", "description": "Amazon.com Inc. chose a processor from MediaTek Inc. for the newest version of its Fire TV streaming box, ditching a component from Qualcomm Inc. it used in a previous version of the product.", "card": "summary", "site": "@business"}, "parsely-author": "Ian King", "parsely-type": "post", "keywords": "QUALCOMM Inc,MediaTek Inc,Amazon.com Inc,Tech", "news_keywords": "QUALCOMM Inc,MediaTek Inc,Amazon.com Inc,Tech", "parsely-link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-09-17/amazon-chooses-mediatek-chip-for-fire-tv-over-qualcomm", "parsely-title": "Amazon Chooses MediaTek Chip for Fire TV Over Qualcomm", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ff0000", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "parsely-pub-date": "2015-09-17T16:39:41.569Z", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "description": "Amazon.com Inc. chose a processor from MediaTek Inc. for the newest version of its Fire TV streaming box, ditching a component from Qualcomm Inc. it used in a previous version of the product.", "parsely-tags": "QUALCOMM Inc,MediaTek Inc,Amazon.com Inc,Tech,Region: Global,Page: article", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://assets.bwbx.io/business/public/images/favicons/mstile-144x144-bbd2101292.png", "date": "2015-09-17T16:39:41.569Z", "parsely-section": "technology", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "og": {"url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-09-17/amazon-chooses-mediatek-chip-for-fire-tv-over-qualcomm", "type": "website", "site_name": "Bloomberg.com", "description": "Amazon.com Inc. chose a processor from MediaTek Inc. for the newest version of its Fire TV streaming box, ditching a component from Qualcomm Inc. it used in a previous version of the product.", "title": "Amazon Chooses MediaTek Chip for Fire TV Over Qualcomm"}, "fb": {"status": "Amazon.com Inc. chose a processor from MediaTek Inc. for the newest version of its Fire TV streaming box, ditching a component from Qualcomm Inc. it used in a previous version of the product."}, "parsely-post-id": "NUTX5H6KLVRQ01", "format-detection": "telephone=no"}, "article_summary": "Amazon.com Inc. chose a processor from MediaTek Inc. for the newest version of its Fire TV streaming box, ditching a component from Qualcomm Inc. it used in a previous version of the product.\nThe upgraded Fire TV, which streams video over the Internet in higher definition, uses a quad-core processor that\u2019s 75 percent more powerful, according to Amazon.\nAmazon\u2019s offerings, which compete against Apple TV and Roku Inc.\u2019s streaming boxes, took 30 percent of the market in the U.S. in the first quarter, according to Strategy Analytics.\nThe devices were in use in about 36 million U.S. homes, or about a third of those with broadband Internet connections, the researcher said.\nQualcomm is seeking to become less dependent on the phone market, where it\u2019s losing market share, and pushing to get its chips into areas such as drones, cars and home electronics."}
