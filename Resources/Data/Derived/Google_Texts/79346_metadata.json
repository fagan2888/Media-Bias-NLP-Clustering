In this case, that refers to all contraceptive and abortion services for the Catholic plaintiffs, and contraceptive services like the \"week-after\" pill and other medical coverage that Geneva College contends violate its anti-abortion teachings. The school in Beaver Falls is affiliated with the Reformed Presbyterian Church.\n\n\n\nJustice Department lawyers have argued the accommodation solves the problem because it allows religious groups to opt out of directly providing such coverage. But the plaintiffs contend that merely filing the one-page form, which puts a religious group's objections on record with the government, violates their rights because it still \"facilitates\" or \"triggers\" a process that then enables third-party insurers to provide the kind of coverage to which they object.\n\n\n\nThe appellate opinion written by Judge Marjorie O. Rendell rejects that reasoning.\n\n\n\n\"Federal law, rather than any involvement by the appellees in filling out or submitting the self-certification form, creates the obligation\" for third parties to offer the objected-to coverage, Rendell wrote.\n\n\n\nThe opinion says the form merely provides a way for the religious groups to avoid being penalized for opting not to directly provide the benefits. But the groups have argued the form does more than that if the third-party providers can't provide the services before the form is filed. That question is expected to be raised in future appeals.\n\n\n\nThe Catholic plaintiffs raise a second issue. Churches themselves, and their employees, are automatically exempt from the health care mandates. But affiliated organizations - like the college - and charities are not, so the dioceses contend the law essentially divides the church against itself.\n\n\n\nThe 3rd Circuit, based in Philadelphia, is the fourth federal appeals court to rule that the accommodation is not a burden on the nonprofits' exercise of religion. The other courts that have ruled are based in Chicago, Cincinnati and Washington, D.C. At least four other appellate courts are considering the same issue, and experts on both sides expect the Supreme Court eventually will settle the matter.\n\n\n\nThe justices could act on a request by the University of Notre Dame as soon as Feb. 23. The earliest the issue could be argued at the Supreme Court is October, and a decision would not be expected until 2016.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Local News", "ib-analytics": "data", "item-publish-date": "Thu, 12 Feb 2015 19:23:34 EST", "generator": "CoreMedia", "author": "JOE MANDAK, Associated Press", "og": {"site_name": "WTAE", "description": "The Pittsburgh Catholic Diocese and Geneva College are mulling whether they should appeal the ruling over their challenge to birth control coverage mandates as part of the\u00a0Affordable Care Act.", "title": "Court nixes faith-based birth control mandate challenge", "url": "http://www.wtae.com/news/court-nixes-faithbased-birth-control-mandate-challenge/31232842", "image": "http://www.wtae.com/image/view/-/7930678/medRes/2/-/maxh/630/maxw/1200/-/o32sbrz/-/Federal-courthouse---16576847.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.wtae.com/news/court-nixes-faithbased-birth-control-mandate-challenge/31232842", "app": {"url": {"ipad": "wtae://content/article/31232842", "iphone": "wtae://content/article/31232842", "googleplay": "wtae://content/article/31232842"}, "name": {"ipad": "wtae", "iphone": "wtae", "googleplay": "wtae"}, "id": {"ipad": 506053781, "iphone": 506053781, "googleplay": "com.hearst.android.wtae"}}, "site": "@WTAE", "card": "app"}, "description": "The Pittsburgh Catholic Diocese and Geneva College are mulling whether they should appeal the ruling over their challenge to birth control coverage mandates as part of the\u00a0Affordable Care Act.", "al": {"android": {"url": "wtae://content/article/31232842", "app_name": "wtae", "package": "com.hearst.android.wtae"}, "ios": {"url": "wtae://content/article/31232842", "app_store_id": 506053781, "app_name": "wtae"}}, "fb": {"app_id": 103664079013}, "keywords": "birth control", "google-site-verification": "yDb1_gOPiN1BUVxthVho7DtUbsFNoHF1JMM4A1Pldk8", "news_keywords": "birth control"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde4c5\"", "article_summary": "All three groups -- the college and the Pittsburgh and Erie dioceses -- are mulling whether to appeal to the entire 3rd Circuit Court or the U.S. Supreme Court.\nThe earliest the issue could be argued at the Supreme Court is October, and a decision would not be expected until 2016.\nCircuit Court of Appeals panel found that the reforms place \"no substantial burden\" on the religious groups and therefore don't violate their First Amendment right to religious expression.\nJustice Department lawyers have argued the accommodation solves the problem because it allows religious groups to opt out of directly providing such coverage.\nA federal appeals court has reversed lower-court victories by two western Pennsylvania Catholic dioceses and a private Christian college that challenged birth control coverage mandates as part of federal health care reforms."}
