Thousands of people wearing blue, yellow, and ratty clothes filled the streets of Brookings for a day-long party.\n\nIt was a tradition started in 1912, and Hobo Day continues to grow. It's touted as biggest one day event in the Dakotas, bringing South Dakota State students of the past, present, and future to Brookings. Peg Becker graduated in 1982. She's made it back to Hobo Day almost every year.\n\n\"It's a lot of fun. It's a great time to meet with other alumni and just hang out with family,\" Peg Becker said.\n\nThe day's events included a parade and thousands of people tailgating outside of Coughlin Alumni Stadium before SDSU kicked-off. While it is a party for many students, senior Daniel Paluch says this event means more to him.\n\n\"Hobo Day is a tradition. My father went here so he brought me to games growing up that's more than likely why I'm a Jackrabbit and I just embrace it,\" Daniel Paluch said.\n\nThe tradition also helps downtown businesses as the Hobo Day's Parade goes right through the heart of the city.\n\nTrendz Consignment is one of those stores. Josie Rykhus says once the parade wrapped up, people flocked into the store.\n\n\"There was a lot of people downtown, more than I've ever seen. Everyone wearing blue and gold but just the street was packed with people whether they're in the parade, coming back through, or just watching in general,\" Josie Rykhus said.\n\nWhether it's helping a store's bottom line, or Jackrabbit fans gearing up for the big game, Hobo Day will continue to be a Brookings tradition.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "KELOLAND News", "description": "For 102 years Hobo Day has been a part of South Dakota State tradition.
