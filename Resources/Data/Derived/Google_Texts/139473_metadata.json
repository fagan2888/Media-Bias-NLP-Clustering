Now it\u2019s your chance to go experience it.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve heard it at all the department stores,\u201d said John Stubbs, Musical Director of the California Ballet Company. \u201cSo they should actually come see it in the actual context in the theater, with the dancers and live music.\n\nTchaikovsky The Nutcracker Ballet has been mesmerizing people around the world for more than a century. San Diego\u2019s California Ballet has been treating locals with the popular show annually since 1971. This year, more than 70 dancers spent the last three months preparing for its nine day run.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the tradition that we present to the San Diego community every year to bring the holiday spirit to everyone and to teach them the beauty of ballet,\u201d said Denise Dabrowski, Regisseur of the California Ballet Company.\n\nChie Kudo is a ballerina from Japan. She has been the Sugar Plum Fairy for the last six years for the California Ballet. She says it is a traditional yet timeless piece that resonates with audiences of all ages.\n\n\u201cI try to keep it fresh,\u201d said Kudo. \u201cEvery year, I have a new partner. It\u2019s a challenge to meet someone and suddenly become their dance partner in two months. But it\u2019s exciting. I learn something new everyday.\u201d\n\nTo make it even more accessible, the company is using the discount app, Groupon to attract those who might otherwise pass on the show. Company officials say it is crucial to use all avenues of advertising, especially when fine arts programs are being cut all across California\u2019s public education.\n\n\u201cI want people to keep coming to things like this and see how valuable music and dance are together, that is what I hope,\u201d said Stubbs. \u201cThat\u2019s why we present it every single year.\u201d\n\nWhen they do make a visit, performers guarantee patrons will leave with an out of this world experience.\n\n\u201cThe audience will walk out of the theater with a warm and fuzzy feeling, like they just woke up from a dream,\u201d said Kudo.\n\nThe Nutcracker at the San Diego Civic Theater has nine more shows until 22nd.\n\nTickets are available here.", "article_metadata": {"description": "SAN DIEGO - The magic and mystery of the Nutcracker comes to life Saturday, as San Diego\u2019s oldest and largest ballet company kicks off the first show of the season.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "FOX5 San Diego - San Diego News, Weather, Traffic and Sports | KSWB", "description": "SAN DIEGO \u2013 The magic and mystery of the Nutcracker comes to life Saturday, as San Diego\u2019s oldest and largest ballet company kicks off the first show of the season.
