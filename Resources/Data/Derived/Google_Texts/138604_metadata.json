Paul LePage is in danger of losing his re-election bid.\n\nOne of the most conservative governors in the country, LePage triangulated his way to victory in 2010 with 38 percent of the vote. Independent candidate Eliot Cutler, who siphoned enough Democratic support to give LePage the victory, is running again this year. But the Georgetown-educated lawyer is not drawing the numbers he did four years ago.\n\nThe latest polls show Democrat Rep. Mike Michaud holding a slim lead around 40 percent.\n\nLarry Sabato\u2019s Center for Politics lists LePage as one of the nation\u2019s three most vulnerable GOP governors up for re-election, along with Rick Scott of Florida and Tom Corbett of Pennsylvania.\n\nAscendant Democrats\u2014who regained control of the legislature in 2012\u2014have dogged LePage from the beginning of his term. He hasn\u2019t backed down.\n\nThe former Waterville mayor has told the NAACP to \u201ckiss my butt,\u201d called the IRS \u201cthe new Gestapo\u201d and said he wouldn\u2019t be afraid to tell President Obama to \u201cgo to hell.\u201d\n\nShattering any notion of bipartisanship, he turned a traditional welcoming speech at the opening of the 2013 Legislature into a full-frontal attack on Democrats.\n\nLePage vetoed a record 38 bills that session, mainly on fiscal grounds. Among his vetoes, he cut state spending and blocked higher snowmobile fees.\n\nLePage\u2019s pro-business and tough-on-crime agenda plays well in the small towns and rural sections of Maine.\n\nRobert Norton of Rockland said he supports LePage\u2019s decision to quit the National Governors Association. LePage called the $60,000 annual dues a waste of state money.\n\n\u201cThey are too politically correct and everybody is lovey-dovey and no decisions are ever made,\u201d LePage declared.\n\nTaxpayer groups, meanwhile, applaud LePage for curbing welfare spending and putting a five-year cap on benefits. Before 2010, Maine was the only state to rank among the top six in per-capita use of food stamps, Medicaid and Temporary Assistance to Needy Families.\n\nMichaud, now representing Maine\u2019s 2nd District, would become the nation\u2019s first openly gay governor. He\u2019s banking on center-left independent voters to abandon Cutler, whose fiscal and social agenda virtually mirrors Michaud\u2019s.\n\nRead more at Watchdog.com.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Outspoken and under fire, Republican Gov.
