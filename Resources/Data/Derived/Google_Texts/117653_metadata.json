Agence France-Presse/Getty Images\n\nWith more than a decade of overseas operations coming to an end, the Pentagon is cutting back spending, leading to plenty of grumbling from the companies that rely on defense spending for much of their income.\n\nOne of those companies: Raytheon, maker of Tomahawk missiles and other military gadgets. In January, the Navy proposed the company end production of new Tomahawks in 2017 . Its stockpile of about 3,000 of the missiles is more than the 2,300 that have been fired in all combat operations combined.\n\nRaytheon is warning that if it shuts down production of the Tomahawk and the U.S. finds itself in a situation where it needs more of them, it will be complicated and expensive to get production going again. As the WSJ\u2019s Doug Cameron reports:\n\nRaytheon contends that halting its Tomahawk production line in Tucson, Ariz., ahead of the 2019 upgrades would drive some suppliers out of business, and push engineers to other sectors, eroding the military\u2019s ability to field an important weapon. The company sent the Pentagon a list of a dozen companies that Raytheon executives believe could close or be forced to leave the defense sector, according to people familiar with the situation. The Pentagon says it takes such concerns seriously. \u201c[We] recognize the need to maintain the vendor base activity as far into the future as we can,\u201d said Capt. Joe Mauser, the Tomahawk program\u2019s executive officer. In its annual report on the defense industrial base last October, the Pentagon detailed a \u201cserious and valid concern\u201d about the health of some small suppliers for cruise missile programs, and mapped out efforts to find alternative suppliers.\n\nSee the full story here\u2026", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "Raytheon is warning that if it shuts down production of the Tomahawk missile, it will be complicated and expensive to get production going again if more are needed.", "title": "Defense Companies Warn: Cutting Military Spending Can Be Expensive", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/corporate-intelligence/2014/07/03/defense-companies-warn-cutting-military-spending-can-be-expensive/", "image": {"src": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/OB-XK637_0509ar_G_20130509163159.jpg"}, "site": "WSJ", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Business", "article.headline": "Defense Companies Warn: Cutting Military Spending Can Be Expensive", "description": "Raytheon is warning that if it shuts down production of the Tomahawk missile, it will be complicated and expensive to get production going again if more are needed.", "article_section": "Business", "author": "Tom Gara", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "Corporate Intelligence Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "Corporate Intelligence", "article.summary": "Raytheon is warning that if it shuts down production of the Tomahawk missile, it will be complicated and expensive to get production going again if more are needed.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2014-07-03T18:20:26-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-138", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/corporate-intelligence/2014/07/03/defense-companies-warn-cutting-military-spending-can-be-expensive/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-234B-5039", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Business", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "Raytheon is warning that if it shuts down production of the Tomahawk missile, it will be complicated and expensive to get production going again if more are needed.", "title": "Defense Companies Warn: Cutting Military Spending Can Be Expensive", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/corporate-intelligence/2014/07/03/defense-companies-warn-cutting-military-spending-can-be-expensive/", "image": {"width": 553, "identifier": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/OB-XK637_0509ar_G_20130509163159.jpg", "height": 369}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Corporate Intelligence", "article.id": "BL-234B-5039", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2014-07-03T18:25:19-04:00"}, "article_summary": "One of those companies: Raytheon, maker of Tomahawk missiles and other military gadgets.\nAgence France-Presse/Getty ImagesWith more than a decade of overseas operations coming to an end, the Pentagon is cutting back spending, leading to plenty of grumbling from the companies that rely on defense spending for much of their income.\nJoe Mauser, the Tomahawk program\u2019s executive officer.\nFirst used in the Gulf War, the Tomahawk cruise missile has become a vital instrument of naval firepower.\nThe company sent the Pentagon a list of a dozen companies that Raytheon executives believe could close or be forced to leave the defense sector, according to people familiar with the situation."}
