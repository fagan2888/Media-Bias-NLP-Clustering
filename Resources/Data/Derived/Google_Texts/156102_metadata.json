The dispute stems from a medical-malpractice lawsuit filed in 2008 by dental assistant Susan Kalitan, who suffered a perforated esophagus after tubes were inserted into her mouth as part of the anesthesia process during a surgery for carpal-tunnel syndrome.\n\nA jury awarded Kalitan about $4.7 million, with $4 million of that in non-economic damages, which are commonly known as pain-and-suffering damages, according to court records.\n\nBut a circuit judge, applying the caps from the 2003 law, reduced the non-economic damages award by about $2 million. The 4th District Court of Appeal, however, ruled that the caps in personal-injury cases were unconstitutional.\n\nThat came after the Supreme Court in 2014 rejected caps on non-economic damages in wrongful-death cases. The 2003 law was highly controversial and passed after months of battling in the Legislature. Attorney General Pam Bondi's office has filed a brief in the Kalitan case urging the Supreme Court to uphold the damage limits.", "article_metadata": {"category": "News", "description": "The Florida Supreme Court will hear arguments June 9 in a case about the constitutionality of medical-malpractice damage caps that the Legislature approved", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://health.wusf.usf.edu/post/supreme-court-malpractice-caps-arguments-set", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/healthnewsfl/files/styles/medium/public/201508/stock_photo_general_surgery_us_army.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "The Florida Supreme Court will hear arguments June 9 in a case about the constitutionality of medical-malpractice damage caps that the Legislature approved", "title": "Supreme Court: Malpractice Caps Arguments Set"}, "org_id": 0, "twitter": {"site": "@HealthNewsFL", "card": "summary"}, "author": "News Service Of Florida", "wordCount": 240, "dc": {"title": "Supreme Court: Malpractice Caps Arguments Set"}, "nid": 14001, "datePublished": "2016-03-22", "story_id": 471387061, "keywords": "medical malpractic caps, malpractice", "has_audio": 0, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "The Florida Supreme Court will hear arguments June 9 in a case about the constitutionality of medical-malpractice damage caps that the Legislature approved in 2003.\nThat came after the Supreme Court in 2014 rejected caps on non-economic damages in wrongful-death cases.\nAttorney General Pam Bondi's office has filed a brief in the Kalitan case urging the Supreme Court to uphold the damage limits.\nThe 4th District Court of Appeal, however, ruled that the caps in personal-injury cases were unconstitutional.\nBut a circuit judge, applying the caps from the 2003 law, reduced the non-economic damages award by about $2 million."}
