Curt Clawson, F-Fla., stands outside the U.S. Capitol in Washington. (Photo: LEDYARD KING/THE NEWS-PRESS WASHINGTON BUREAU)\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 Curt Clawson has never fit neatly into the mold of a Capitol Hill Republican, and he proved it again on Thursday.\n\nWithin the space of hour that morning, the Bonita Springs Republican voted for a Republican spending bill that would prevent President Barack Obama from closing the Guantanamo Bay detention center, and for a Democratic measure to restrict the display of the Confederate flag at veterans\u2019 cemeteries.\n\nSuch apparent contradictions are typical of Clawson, 56, who announced this week that he'll retire from the House after his term expires in January. He\u2019s been able to follow his own playbook largely because he was rich enough to fund his own campaign (he spent $3.4 million) and never intended to make a career out of Congress.\n\n\u201cCongressman Clawson was one of the few politicians that does what he says and says what he does,\u201d said Taylor Budowich, executive director of the California-based Tea Party Express, which tapped Clawson last year to give the tea party's response to Obama\u2019s State of the Union address. \u201cHis departure is not only a loss for his constituents, but it's a loss for conservative voters across the country that looked to him for principled solutions and leadership.\"\n\nClawson is a member of the ultra-conservative Freedom Caucus that demands hard-line fiscal accountability and helped topple John Boehner as House speaker. But he\u2019s also championed causes dear to African Americans \u2014 with an enthusiasm that's even surprised advocates -\u2014 and legislation to protect the Everglades.\n\n\"We didn\u2019t buy the notion that you couldn\u2019t be a conservationist to the core and still be conservative,\u201d said Clawson, who also fought efforts to open up oil drilling in the Eastern Gulf of Mexico. \u201cWe think you can be conservative and supported by the red base and still be for conservation because it\u2019s the right thing for the ecology, the right thing for the animals, and the right thing for the economy.\u201d\n\nWith more than seven months left in his term, Clawson is focused on passing two bills. One would set aside $800 million to expedite repairs to the Herbert Hoover Dike surrounding Lake Okeechobee. The other would authorize $500 million for the Interior Department to buy land near Lake Okeechobee to restore the natural flow of water south and away from communities on the Atlantic and Gulf coasts.\n\nGetting either measure signed into law would represent a stunning victory for a junior member of the House on his way out the door, especially considering that Congress typically accomplishes very little during election years.\n\nBut Clawson doesn\u2019t seem fazed by expectations, or by the notion that staunch conservatives don't care about the environment. It was the pollution befouling Southwest Florida shores \u2013 and his father\u2019s insistence that he do something about it \u2013 that prompted Clawson to run for the House in the first place.\n\nEric Eikenberg, chief executive officer of the Everglades Foundation, recalled being impressed with Clawson's devotion to the environment during a briefing shortly after his election in 2014.\n\n\u201cHaving been around members of Congress for a number of years, I figured it would be a 20-minute meeting, maybe 30 minutes max,\" Eikenberg said. \"And after close to four hours, I knew he was serious about the challenges that his community faces as well as the need to implement Everglades restoration. He was not somebody that just talked. He dug into issues and wanted to find common ground.\u201d\n\nOnce he arrived in the House, Clawson's millionaire status allowed him to set his own agenda without feeling beholden to special-interest groups. He also resisted pressure to do constant fundraising for the party, something GOP leaders expect of rank-and-file lawmakers. That stance cost him the seat he had hoped to get on the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think (much of) our current business model and our governance model within the Republican Party of top-down, driven by seniority, how you vote, and how much money you (raise),\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t accept that business model and I was going to do everything I can to change that so the grass roots gets heard more.\u201d\n\nOn several occasions, Clawson voted against leadership-backed bills on important policy issues. He opposed a massive government spending bill, for example, because it kept the Affordable Care Act intact, financed the administration\u2019s strategy in Syria and spent what Clawson felt was too much money. He also voted no on a highway funding bill because he felt it was financed using gimmicks; and on a tax bill, because it could have made illegal immigrants eligible for tax credits.\n\nHe also occasionally veered left.\n\nTwice last summer, he was the only House Republican to vote with Democrats to remove items featuring the Confederate battle flag from public display on the House side of the Capitol.\n\nThat earned Clawson the respect of Rep. Bennie Thompson, a Democrat from Mississippi who led the charge on the issue.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve kind of been around over 20 years and that\u2019s the kind of issue that sets a member apart from any group they belong to,\u2019\u2019 Thompson said, referring to Clawson\u2019s affiliation with the Freedom Caucus. \u201cI think a lot of what he will be known for is the fact that he didn\u2019t allow party or anything else to prevent him from voting what he thought was correct.\u201d\n\nThe issue was a personal one for Clawson, whose office wall features a photo of him with Democratic Rep. John Lewis of Georgia, an icon of the civil rights movement.\n\nA former Purdue University basketball player, Clawson once was married to a black woman. He said he can still remember fellow basketball players recoiling at the site of the Confederate flag, and his long discussions about the issue with family members.\n\nThere have been missteps, some of them not unusual for someone who never held public office before coming to Congress.\n\nShortly after arriving in the House, Clawson got caught at a hearing mistakenly identifying two senior administration officials of South Asian descent as representatives of the Indian government. After video of the exchange went viral, he apologized and called the incident an \u201cair ball,\u201d an example of the sports metaphors the former college athlete uses.\n\nClawson doesn\u2019t seem particularly sad to be leaving Congress, although he clearly regrets that his father's declining health is the reason. He said he probably wouldn't have stayed in office more than another term anyway.\n\n\u201cThe idea of citizen legislators that come without ambition and (put) the country and their constituents first is what a lot of the Founding Fathers really did envision,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd if we had more folks up here on a temporary basis, going to battle for their constituents and then going home as opposed to building a career, I think we\u2019d have a better democracy.\u201d\n\nContributing: Deborah Barfield Berry, USA TODAY\n\nTwitter: @ledgeking\n\nRead or Share this story: http://newspr.es/27KGjPD", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Curt Clawson, who is not seeking re-election, has defied convention as a member of the conservative Freedom Caucus who also votes for environmental spending.", "og": {"site_name": "The News-Press", "description": "Curt Clawson, who is not seeking re-election, has defied convention as a member of the conservative Freedom Caucus who also votes for environmental spending.", "title": "Retiring Rep.
