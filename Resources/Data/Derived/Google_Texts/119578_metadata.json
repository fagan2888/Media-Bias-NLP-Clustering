That\u2019s the opposite of compassion.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not interested in getting rid of a safety net, I\u2019m interested in getting rid of dependency,\u201d Carson said, prompting one in a series of raucous rounds of applause.\n\nThe 63-year-old Carson, a former pediatric neurosurgeon, has gained favor among Tea Party supporters in recent years with his preference for limited government and came in third place in last year\u2019s closely watched CPAC Straw Poll, which always closes the yearly conference.\n\nThis year, Carson spent much of his 12-minute address ripping President Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act as well as other federal entitlement programs, telling the crowd that \u201cObamacare is about restriction and control.\u201d\n\n\u201cEverything that these programs were supposed to fix has gotten worse,\u201d he said.\n\nCarson went on to briefly touch on a series of ideas that are typically well-received among conservatives, including trimming the national debt and reducing the size of government.\n\n\u201cOne of the things that is going to destroy us as a nation is our debt,\u201d he said, as several members of the audience yelled \u201cyes\u201d in support. \u201cThe size of our government needs to be going down and the debt needs to be going down.\u201d\n\nCarson also fielded a few questions during the question-and-answer session about his views on foreign affairs, saying that the U.S. must take a stronger leadership role in the world.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m ready for leadership on the world stage and not just sitting around and waiting to see what other people do,\u201d he said.\n\nThe four-day CPAC is commonly regarded by conservatives as a testing ground for likely presidential candidates. Carson hasn\u2019t said whether he will run.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "ADAM EDELMAN", "twitter": {"description": "Carson kicked off CPAC by saying the next President must \u201cget rid of dependency\u201d that some Americans might have on government.", "title": "Ben Carson kicks off CPAC 2015 with anti-Obamacare speech", "url": "http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/ben-carson-kicks-cpac-2015-anti-obamacare-speech-article-1.2130015", "image": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2130013.1424959939!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/carson27n-2-web.jpg", "site": "@nydailynews", "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.tags": "cpac,2016,ben carson", "parsely-author": "Adam Edelman", "parsely-type": "article", "keywords": "cpac,2016,ben carson", "nydn_tags": "cpac, 2016, ben carson", "news_keywords": "cpac,2016,ben carson", "parsely-link": "http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/ben-carson-kicks-cpac-2015-anti-obamacare-speech-article-1.2130015", "parsely-title": "Ben Carson kicks off CPAC 2015 with anti-Obamacare speech", "sailthru.date": "2015-02-26T09:15:36-0500", "sailthru.title": "Ben Carson kicks off CPAC 2015 with anti-Obamacare speech", "nydn_section": "Politics", "parsely-pub-date": "2015-02-26T14:15:36", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2130013.1424959939!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/carson27n-2-web.jpg", "description": "Carson kicked off CPAC by saying the next President must \u201cget rid of dependency\u201d that some Americans might have on government.", "robots": "NOARCHIVE", "fb": {"admins": 1594068001, "app_id": 107464888913, "pages": 268914272540}, "msvalidate.01": "02916AAC0DA8B068EFE01D721E03ED7E", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/NYDailyNews/"}, "sailthru.description": "Carson kicked off CPAC by saying the next President must \u201cget rid of dependency\u201d that some Americans might have on government.", "viewport": "width=device-width, height=device-height, initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no", "parsely-section": "Politics", "og": {"site_name": "NY Daily News", "description": "Carson kicked off CPAC by saying the next President must \u201cget rid of dependency\u201d that some Americans might have on government.", "title": "Ben Carson kicks off CPAC 2015 with anti-Obamacare speech", "url": "http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/ben-carson-kicks-cpac-2015-anti-obamacare-speech-article-1.2130015", "image": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2130013.1424959939!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/carson27n-2-web.jpg", "type": "article"}, "parsely-tags": "cpac, 2016, ben carson", "parsely-image-url": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2130013.1424959939!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/carson27n-2-web.jpg", "p": {"domain_verify": "78efe4f5c9935744af497772f68a0ee7"}, "nydn_byline": "ADAM EDELMAN", "sailthru.credits": "NEW YORK DAILY NEWS"}, "article_summary": "The four-day CPAC is commonly regarded by conservatives as a testing ground for likely presidential candidates.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not compassion to pat them on the head and say, \u2018There, there, I\u2019m going to take care of all your needs, your health care, your food.'\n\u201cI\u2019m not interested in getting rid of a safety net, I\u2019m interested in getting rid of dependency,\u201d Carson said, prompting one in a series of raucous rounds of applause.\nCarson went on to briefly touch on a series of ideas that are typically well-received among conservatives, including trimming the national debt and reducing the size of government.\n\u201cI\u2019m ready for leadership on the world stage and not just sitting around and waiting to see what other people do,\u201d he said."}
