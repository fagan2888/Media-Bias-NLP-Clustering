Elodie was born with under-developed eyes and has retinal detachments, conditions that have made her mostly blind.\n\nWhen they read about the mouse and the cow together, they were reading pages from a plastic, three-dimensional version of \"Goodnight Moon\" created by researchers at the University of Colorado to promote literacy among young children with visual impairments.\n\n\"Elodie loves exploring the tiniest details,\" said Michelle Bateson, who lives in Northern Ireland. \"Her tiny fingers are so sensitive, she finds marks and lines I can't see.\"\n\nThe Bateson family learned of the Boulder-based 3-D project while searching for tactile picture books for Elodie online recently. She's enrolled in a pre-Braille program called \"Fantastic Fingers,\" and the pages of the 3-D book are a good way to practice storytime and reading at home, Bateson said.\n\nTwo years ago, CU assistant professor Tom Yeh and a team of researchers began thinking about how 3-D printing could revolutionize the production of tactile graphics and picture books for children with visual impairments. Since they started working, the team has received dozens of requests for 3-D sample pages from around the world, including from the Batesons in the United Kingdom.\n\nJacob Davis, a student at Skyline High School in Longmont, touches the 3-D representation of a page in a children's book during the Science Discovery program at the University of Colorado earlier this month.

It also helps parents begin to understand their child's learning style, he added.\n\nFor children with visual impairments, the pre-literacy age range between 2 and 5 years old is equally important.\n\n\"We like to support the co-reading experience,\" Yeh said. \"They are just about to learn how to read. For children with visual impairments, they have to learn how to read Braille. They're not there yet, but it's still good value to be able to explore the picture while they're being read to by parents. It's a little bit harder for kids with visual impairments to have that kind of experience.\"\n\nJC Greeley, a teacher at the Anchor Center for Blind Children in Denver, said the recurring exposure to 3-D shapes \u2014 and to Braille \u2014 at an early age can help children become interested in reading.\n\nShe said much like Braille, feeling the 3-D models on a page could help children with visual impairments learn how to piece together the parts of a whole \u2014 whether that's a sentence or a complete picture in a book.\n\nThe CU researchers, who consulted with many Anchor Center parents and teachers, are also creating a 3-D map for the center so that students can feel with their fingers the shapes inside the building.\n\nLois Strope takes notes as Jacob Davis touches a 3-D representation of a children's picture book at the University of Colorado.

It's stories, and then it's tactile and hearing memory. It's being able to help develop cognitive concepts.\"\n\nThe Bateson family loves to read, but finding a detailed, inexpensive way for Elodie to participate has been a challenge, Bateson said.\n\n\"I was looking for different ways to encourage my little girl into early literacy experiences,\" Bateson said. \"I certainly struggle with explaining concepts to my little girl, and teachers and parents have been creating labor-intensive creations for years. To finally have a resource that can be shared with such detail is a gift.\"\n\nPrinting process\n\nThe first book the CU team produced was \"Goodnight Moon,\" a popular bedtime story first published in 1947. In its first 3-D iteration, researchers printed the base page and 3-D objects as one whole, seamless unit.\n\nOn the page opposite the 3-D models, researchers printed the text and Braille words.\n\nIn a second book, \"Harold and the Purple Crayon,\" researchers cut plastic into page-sized rectangles, and then glued the 3-D objects onto the page, which saved them time and money.\n\nThey also experimented with fabrics such as felt as the base for the pages, Yeh said.\n\n\"Not too surprisingly, kids really like this fabric,\" he said. \"Especially for kids with visual impairments, texture is very important to them.\"\n\nEventually, if 3-D printers become cheap enough, parents could make their own tactile books with objects from an online library the CU researchers hope to create, said Jeeeun Kim, a graduate student working on the project.\n\nThey could print increasingly more complex versions of the same page as the child grows, Kim said.\n\n\"A cow model is too complicated,\" Kim said. \"It's not really recognizable for young, young children who have never seen a cow. So we could make different abstracts, like a flat cow image that only has the horns.\"\n\nThere are downsides to this method of creating tactile books and graphics, Yeh noted. Even as the price for the printers is becoming less prohibitive, they're still hard to use.\n\nThe average printing time for one page is about three hours, and many took up to six hours, Yeh said. As with early inkjet and laser printers, 3-D printers experience their own types of malfunctions, much like paper jams. After several hours of printing, Yeh said, it can be frustrating to start over because of a printer failure.\n\nIncreasing diversity\n\nFor \"Harold and the Purple Crayon,\" Yeh looked to one of his upper-level computer science classes this spring. Each student designed, modeled and printed four pages from the book.\n\nA display of their pages \u2014 which are all unique \u2014 has been set up at CU's Gemmill Library of Engineering, Mathematics and Physics.\n\nFor a field that's often stereotyped as male, math-heavy and solitary, the project introduced computer science students to ways they can incorporate art and creativity, as well as societal impact, into their studies, Yeh said.\n\n\"If you go across, you can see that there are so many different ways of rendering and designing Harold, the balloon,\" Yeh said, pointing to the display at CU's engineering library. \"They all look very different.\"\n\nAt a recent summer camp through CU's Science Discovery program, the researchers introduced high school students to the concept of 3-D printing and computer science \u2014 without computers.\n\nThey had the students use Legos and other tools to turn a 2-D image into a 3-D object to show them that the field of computer science isn't just writing code.\n\n\"Computer science is not all about programming or doing something with a computer,\" Kim said.\n\nKim said she could see this type of project attracting people to her field who are more interested in humans than computers, and could provide a space for collaboration with neuroscientists or developmental psychologists.\n\n\"There's not too many projects where you can see a very clear combination of engineering, societal impact and art,\" Yeh said. \"It gives all students an option to communicate through design and 3-D models.\"\n\nContact Camera Staff Writer
