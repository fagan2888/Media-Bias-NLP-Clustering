It is a view of him that I share, and it means a lot to me, because I know in personal ways the difference that the presence, or absence, of a dad can make in a young black man's life.\n\nSo much of my writing over the years has been about the disrespect and even viciousness with which police officers treat black and Latino men. The brutality against Eric Garner, who died 10 days ago after a white officer placed him in what seems to have been a chokehold, is just the latest case.\n\nBut I have to say - and this isn't easy, because tough love never is - that our collective shortcomings as African-American fathers also cause me great distress. Unlike the beatings, chokings and shootings our black youngsters are too frequently victims of - from the police, yes, but often from other black males - the pain of paternal abandonment is a dull ache in the heart that, in the end, can do as much damage as a bullet.\n\nJust this past Monday, Obama met with dozens of young males at a public school in Washington, D.C. - black ones but also others of color - and spoke with them about the value of fatherhood and its responsibilities.\n\n\"If you're African American, there's about a one-in-two chance you grow up without a father in your house - one in two,\" the President said with somber plaintiveness.\n\nAs for me, I don't need data to convince me of the importance of black fatherhood. I have my own family story.\n\nIn 1997, I wrote an article for Essence Magazine titled \"A Father's Longing,\" reflecting on the death of my father, a gifted and educated man who fell victim to alcohol and left me and my mother when I was a child, and mom was crippled with polio.\n\nLater in his life, thanks to Alcoholics Anonymous, dad gave up the bottle and, though I never lived with him, we developed a late-in-life father-son relationship, and I shared its joys and pains with readers of Essence.\n\nThe reaction was extraordinary, with many black people recognizing me from the photo accompanying the article, and engaging me about the topic.\n\nBut the truly stunning result was a phone call I received a year later from a woman in Detroit who identified herself as Linda, the wife of my father's brother, my Uncle Charles, who in the early 1960s had abandoned New York City and his 11 children. We had thought he was dead.\n\nLinda told me that Uncle Charles had died the night before, and that she had known of my relationship to him because she had read the article and had made astute deductions about the familial relationship. But, deferring to Uncle Charles's desires, she had put off calling me until his death.\n\nNow here are the details that rush to the core the story: Of the 11 children (from two households) that Uncle Charles left behind, two were boys - my only male first cousins on my father's side.\n\nThe older one, Charles III, nicknamed Tibby, was beaten to death 30 years ago on the streets of Brownsville by a person or persons never identified. His sisters and mother were of course devastated by the unsolved crime, which only intensified the excruciating hurt caused by their father's disappearance decades previously.\n\nUncle Charles's younger son, Henri, became addicted to heroin, and his whereabouts, if indeed he is alive, are not known to me or any other family members with whom I was able to speak. I had long conversations about ten years ago with Henri's mother, who told me in painful detail how the absconding of the father had devastated Henri in ways that were as emotionally crushing as they were immediate, although the girls were largely able to put themselves on track to productive, professional lives.\n\nTibby's oldest sister, Elizabeth (Lizzie) Howell Greggs, 70, said she has come to understand profoundly the importance of fatherhood to young men in Brownsville, a community in which she was raised and in which she still lives.\n\nBoys need fathers as role models, said Lizzie, who until her retirement earlier this month had spent 40 years teaching kids in the Brownsville Police Athletic League's Head Start program. \"There's so much anger,\" Lizzie said of young men living around her. She added that the pitiful delinquency of her own dad made her more committed to helping young men understand the importance of being involved in the lives of their offspring. As for her home life, she speaks fondly of her deceased husband, a career military man, and is proud of their four adult children. One of them, a son, I've had conversations with and he is a hard-working and disciplined young man, a role model.\n\nLet's not mince words. The crisis of New York City, and to a large extent of America, is the crisis of the black male. You see it in our schools, on our streets, in our economy, in our prisons.

You see it in our schools, on our streets, in our economy, in our prisons.\n\nObama seems determined to strengthen his male-focused My Brother's Keeper Initiative, and on Monday he announced further investments of millions of dollars. My Brother's Keeper is patterned on New York City's Young Men's Initiative, which was organized three years ago by former Mayor Michael Bloomberg. (Yes, the same Michael Bloomberg who allowed police to stop and frisk hundreds of thousands of innocent black and Latino males annually.)\n\nWe should all be grateful for these efforts. Taken together, they suggest a philosophy once articulated by Hillary Clinton - that \"it takes a village to raise a child,\" that if young men of color are to be able to (quite literally) survive, various sectors of society (educators, social service administrators and even entrepreneurs) will have to play respective roles.\n\nAs an educator myself, I should be in a special position to help. But consider this: In my five years of teaching journalism at Brooklyn College, I don't believe I've had more than 10 black males among the several hundred students in my classes.\n\nI noted this paucity even at predominantly black Medgar Evers College, where 15 years ago I taught a writing workshop. There were about a dozen students in the class. All were black. But only one was a male. According to U.S. News & World Report's latest college report, the gender breakdown at Medgar Evers College is 73% female and 27% male.\n\nFor black males, there is a stark tie-in between the education and criminal justice systems, both of which have been failing them miserably. Speaking to MSNBC on Monday, U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder, who grew up in Queens, said that having a father saved him from the horrid fates that befall so many young men of color.\n\n\"I grew up in a lower middle class neighborhood in Queens, New York, and I think of all the advantages I had by having a dad there,\" Holder said. He noted the vast difference in outcomes between him and other young men who did not have it so good. Other \"guys who grew up with me on the block\" ended up \"in fundamentally different places . . . Drug problems. Time in jail,\" Holder added.\n\nAs for me, I survived and accomplished all that I have - Ivy League degrees, comfort in three languages, prize-winning news articles - not because of talents far beyond those of others.\n\nNo, when my father left us, mom and I were given shelter by her parents in their brownstone in the Bedford Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn, and it is to my grandfather that I owe so much.\n\nMy granddad, Bertram L. Baker, was the first black person ever elected to office in Brooklyn (elected to the state Assembly in 1948). He was a fearsome man and an operator. After I, at the age of 13, had been rejected by Brooklyn Preparatory High School, he interceded with the Jesuits there to have me admitted and I went on to excel in academics and in track and field.\n\nThere came a time as a young adult that I disappointed my grandfather. In college, I ran for a stretch with gun-toting, self-styled revolutionaries, and smoked and drank more herb and liquor than I should have. Soon after my graduation, after he learned that I possessed a shotgun, my granddad told me to get the hell out of his house.\n\nBut we reconciled before he died in 1985, and to this day I live much of my life in honor of him. Three years ago I worked to have the street where he lived (Jefferson Ave. between Tompkins and Throop Aves. in Bed-Stuy) co-named after him. I especially appreciated that, in the seven years before his death, my grandfather gave so much attention to my only child, my son Damani, who today is an orthopedic surgeon with two children of his own, both boys, on whom he showers attention.\n\nThere is so much about Brooklyn these days that touches my spirit. In a mystical way, I associate myself with guys I knew in old Bed-Stuy, who died young, many of them from broken homes. I see them as I glimpse the young men of today, pants hanging down, and I see them in the countless black and Latino boys who have been stopped and frisked.\n\nBut there is hope. Hope was, after all, a principal message conveyed by Obama in his climb up the political ladder. As cynical as I am about politicians, I accept his exhortations about the need to expect the best as we strive against odds.\n\nFew things give me more comfort than seeing a young black man walking the sidewalks with a woman seeming to be his wife, one or more youngsters toddling alongside them. If close enough, I smile, in a gesture that is more gratitude that approval, and I maybe hold up a hand or extend a friendly fist, or touch my chest.\n\nOf course there are occasions when the objects of my gratitude don't see me, given their attention on their young ones. But more often than not, there is a return smile. And every time that happens I am certain they know everything on my mind.\n\nHowell, formerly of the Daily News, Newsday and the Associated Press, is a professor of journalism at Brooklyn College.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Ron Howell", "twitter": {"description": "Howell: For millions of black Americans, Barack Obama's legacy is not going to be Obamacare, nor his decision to move troops out of Iraq, nor what he does about immigration.", "title": "Finding our fathers", "url": "http://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/finding-fathers-article-1.1880572", "image": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.1880571.1406326888!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/usa-obama.jpg", "site": "@nydailynews", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-author": "Ron Howell", "parsely-type": "article", "sailthru.credits": "NEW YORK DAILY NEWS", "parsely-pub-date": "2014-07-27T08:30:00", "parsely-link": "http://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/finding-fathers-article-1.1880572", "parsely-title": "Finding our fathers", "sailthru.date": "2014-07-27T04:30:00-0400", "sailthru.title": "Finding our fathers", "nydn_section": "Opinion", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.1880571.1406326888!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/usa-obama.jpg", "description": "Howell: For millions of black Americans, Barack Obama's legacy is not going to be Obamacare, nor his decision to move troops out of Iraq, nor what he does about immigration.", "robots": "NOARCHIVE", "fb": {"admins": 1594068001, "app_id": 107464888913, "pages": 268914272540}, "msvalidate.01": "02916AAC0DA8B068EFE01D721E03ED7E", "parsely-section": "Opinion", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/NYDailyNews/"}, "sailthru.description": "Howell: For millions of black Americans, Barack Obama's legacy is not going to be Obamacare, nor his decision to move troops out of Iraq, nor what he does about immigration.", "viewport": "width=device-width, height=device-height, initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no", "og": {"site_name": "NY Daily News", "description": "Howell: For millions of black Americans, Barack Obama's legacy is not going to be Obamacare, nor his decision to move troops out of Iraq, nor what he does about immigration.", "title": "Finding our fathers", "url": "http://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/finding-fathers-article-1.1880572", "image": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.1880571.1406326888!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/usa-obama.jpg", "type": "article"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "78efe4f5c9935744af497772f68a0ee7"}, "nydn_byline": "Ron Howell", "parsely-image-url": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.1880571.1406326888!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/usa-obama.jpg"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb10e\"", "article_summary": "Howell, formerly of the Daily News, Newsday and the Associated Press, is a professor of journalism at Brooklyn College.\nHe noted the vast difference in outcomes between him and other young men who did not have it so good.\nOne of them, a son, I've had conversations with and he is a hard-working and disciplined young man, a role model.\nFew things give me more comfort than seeing a young black man walking the sidewalks with a woman seeming to be his wife, one or more youngsters toddling alongside them.\n\"There's so much anger,\" Lizzie said of young men living around her."}
