It rankles me and it makes me think about how unfair and perhaps illegal it is to levy a fine on someone simply because they cannot afford something, such as health insurance.\n\nIn my home, if I only have $200 in my checking account and my bills for that month are $300 then something doesn\u2019t get paid. The government does this all the time and it\u2019s OK for it. So, why not me? I don\u2019t buy things I cannot afford, either. What foolishness that would be.\n\nMany Americans have been priced/squeezed out of Obamacare because Barack Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act formula doesn\u2019t care about what your bills are. There isn\u2019t even a place to demonstrate that your bills exceed your ability to purchase Obamacare, even with the subsidies they offer.\n\nSo, here I sit waiting for the bad news. Even though I might have been getting a return on my taxes, it will be gobbled up by the fine for not buying Obamacare. Just another excuse for the government to stick its hand into your pocket is how I see it.\n\nI wish we had a bloc of both Democrat and Republican politicians who would review and rescind Obama\u2019s folly, ACA. Only divine intervention and common sense can help us now against this full-on assault against middle America.\n\nCharles Ferguson\n\nWindsor", "article_metadata": {"description": "Letter", "generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Central Maine", "description": "Letter", "title": "Unfair to fine someone who can't afford insurance - Central Maine", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://www.centralmaine.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/cm-icon-blackForSharing.png", "updated_time": "2015-04-03T16:02:29-04:00", "url": "http://www.centralmaine.com/2015/04/06/unfair-to-fine-someone-who-cant-afford-insurance/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.centralmaine.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/cm-icon-blackForSharing.png", "description": "Letter", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Unfair to fine someone who can't afford insurance - Central Maine"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=966680591", "fb": {"app_id": 754222714628811}, "article": {"section": "Letters to the Editor", "published_time": "2015-04-06T04:00:00-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-04-03T16:02:29-04:00"}, "google-site-verification": "DT-FwcrUrXtAltcTNXUsA7tR4Ha0CLErawYbGlkpg94", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe02f9\"", "article_summary": "It rankles me and it makes me think about how unfair and perhaps illegal it is to levy a fine on someone simply because they cannot afford something, such as health insurance.\nAs I sit here thinking about the tax preparer coming this afternoon, I can\u2019t help but also think about what the fine is going to be for not having insurance under Obamacare.\nMany Americans have been priced/squeezed out of Obamacare because Barack Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act formula doesn\u2019t care about what your bills are.\nEven though I might have been getting a return on my taxes, it will be gobbled up by the fine for not buying Obamacare.\nI wish we had a bloc of both Democrat and Republican politicians who would review and rescind Obama\u2019s folly, ACA."}
